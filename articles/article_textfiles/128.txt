{"Body": ["Illustration by Rem Broo", "Early in", ", Nikil Saval\u2019s detailed cultural history of how the office grew to become the definitive 20", "century workplace, Saval presents a description of the stylish office worker, courtesy of Walt Whitman circa", ".* At that time, nonmanual labor accounted for a minority of jobs in the country, and those who did spend their days in an office were often the source of derision. Whitman, for one, described office workers as \u201ca slender and round-shouldered generation, of minute leg, chalky face, and hollow chest \u2026 trig and prim in great glow of shiny boots, clean shirts\u2014sometimes, just now, of extraordinary patterns, as if overrun with bugs!\u2014tight pantaloons, straps, which seem coming little into fashion again, startling cravats, and hair all soaked and \u2018slickery\u2019 with sickening oils.\u201d", "Adjust for some\u2014but only some\u2014changes in fashion and that passage could describe the put-together hipster or flashy banker you saw on the way to work today. You can take or leave the mockery (perhaps the description hits a little close to home), but Whitman\u2019s words undoubtedly still resonate. Saval\u2019s book accentuates the transformations that occurred as those weak and spindly office workers began to inherit the Earth, or at least the eight-hour workday. In 1880, less than 5 percent of the American workforce worked in nonmanual labor, although the number was much higher\u2014in the 20-40 percent rage\u2014in cities like Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Boston. As trade expanded across the country, the amount of clerical work increased. And as the number of people working in offices grew, the question arose of how to optimize efficiency and, in some cases, comfort in this new work climate.", "Throughout", ", we read about \u201cthe dream of a better office,\u201d but that phrase turns comical as we realize how little progress ever gets made.", "To start, Saval explains, many offices took a cue from the factory and lined desks up in long rows. Then, in the early 20", "century, two innovations emerged that would get recycled and reinterpreted in various ways over the next century. The first arrived courtesy of Frederick Taylor, a consultant and theorist who made it his goal to remove all inefficiencies from the office and argued for an extreme division of labor to replace what was the more fluid work style of the old clerks, who worked in small offices of four or five people and were responsible for a wide variety of tasks. Taylor created the position of the manager. As Saval writes:", "By separating knowledge from the basic work process \u2026 the ideology of Taylorism all but ensured a workplace divided against itself, both in space and in practice, with a group of managers controlling how work was done and their workers merely performing that work.", "Even as some offices today, particularly those in the tech industry, have attempted to move toward nonhierarchical models that recognize the benefit of idle, creative time, most still employ a version of this hierarchical, efficiency-driven system. The drive to get workers producing at highest capacity probably reached its apex with Robert Propst\u2019s Action Office in the 1960s. The Action Office was an open-concept space consisting of several different working spaces, including a desk that you sat at and a larger drafting table that you could stand over. Propst\u2019s second version of the Action Office, created after the first failed to gain traction in the marketplace, added walls of different heights around the workspace.", "Propst\u2019s ideas were received rapturously, heralded for finally allowing the office \u201cto achieve the work utopia that it had always promised.\u201d As Saval writes: \u201cMost office designs were about keeping people in place; Action Office was about movement. For in keeping with the ergonomic thinking that Propst had been doing for years, the motion of the body assisted\u2014corresponded to\u2014the ceaselessly inventive motion of the white-collar mind.\u201d", "The results, however, were hardly radical. The Action Office, which was meant to liberate workers and get them moving around the office, instead led directly to the proliferation of its stifling cousin-in-design: the cubicle.", "The same ironic story gets repeated with almost every grand design that Saval describes. Throughout", ", we read about \u201cthe dream of a better office,\u201d but that phrase and others like it turn comical as we realize how little progress ever gets made toward turning that dream into reality.", "That\u2019s not to say that nothing has changed about office life at all in the past century. Saval emphasizes how offices were, for much of the 20", "century, filled only with white men, an unfortunate reality that has slowly been reversed. But if the people doing the work have grown more diverse, any changes in how that work is actually done has tended toward the superficial, despite what the Taylors and Propsts of the world may have hoped.", ", Matthew Shaer wrote about the new trend of bossless offices, where hiring and firing is done through consensus and teams complete projects with little to no hierarchical supervision. The notion appears revolutionary, but as Shaer writes, the results are anything but. Shaer describes watching a group of workers at Menlo, one of the companies trying out the \u201cflattened office\u201d theory, and realizing that \u201chowever ostensibly egalitarian this Menlo work team was, in practice, a leader had quickly emerged, and everyone else was falling in line.\u201d", "As Shaer points out after, that doesn\u2019t take away from the project: \u201cThe triumph of the flattened office may be the creation of work environments in which leaders organically arise, and all employees feel a sense of ownership, whether real or imagined.\u201d For the kind of worker who fits in at Menlo at least, the process is less oppressive, but ultimately a hierarchy ends up appearing regardless, and from an outsider\u2019s perspective the work process is only slightly altered.", "Photo by Katrina Ohstrom", "Regardless of where it happens\u2014in a cubicle, an open-concept warehouse floor, or a coffee shop\u2014or how much personal freedom you have while doing it, office work has an underlying consistency. At its heart are basic and similar building blocks: assignments, projects, and deliverables spread out over, if you\u2019re lucky, an eight-hour day. Even the shift to freelancing is not as tectonic on a day-to-day basis as it can appear from the outside. In fact, the first thing you learn as a freelancer is that the freedom it offers is mostly a fantasy. The experience is similar to the scene in", "where Sally explains the false rationale behind deciding not to have kids with her boyfriend: \u201cJoe and I used to talk about it, and we'd say we were so lucky \u2026 we can have sex on the kitchen floor and not worry about the kids walking in.\u201d But of course, they never did. Freelancing in theory allows for impromptu midweek vacations and afternoon beers, but there\u2019s still 40, 50, 60 hours of work to do a week, and it doesn\u2019t get done by assuming you can now sleep in on Wednesday because you have no boss waiting for you at the office.", "Of course, there are real changes facing people entering the workforce today and many signs that point to hard times coming for the white-collar worker:", ",", ", and the record number of freelance and temp workers\u2014", "and", ". But the troubling aspect of these changes has little to do with management or design theories, with where and how people do their work, which is what most of", "focuses on. What\u2019s worrisome about the future of work today is the seeming irreversible loss in stability, the increasingly prevalent notion that you can\u2019t depend on a job for more than a few months.", "Saval confronts this uncertain future at the end of the book. Recent changes, Saval argues, suggest that \u201cthe career path that defined the white-collar worker for generations \u2026 is coming to a close, and that a new sort of work, as yet unformed, is taking its place.\u201d It\u2019s a compelling conclusion, but one that the rest of", "hasn\u2019t properly prepared us for. Saval begins the book by acknowledging in a footnote that it will ignore the \u201cwider world of work,\u201d which is precisely what we would need to know about to understand what comes next for the office worker, or to comprehend what the nature of work might look like if offices are in fact on the way out as the most common workplace.", "However, if", "doesn\u2019t serve well as a prophetic text, in its best moments it does offer some insight into what we might be losing. At one point, in one of many pop culture examples used throughout the book, Saval references Tom Rath, the middle-manager protagonist of the 1955 novel", ", who at the end of the book turns down \u201can executive position so that he could work less and spend time with his family (but still earn enough money to maintain a large home in suburban Connecticut).\u201d", "On the one hand, Rath represents a bygone era, where similar middle-management positions provided so many people with a cozy middle-class life. But Rath\u2019s decision is also one that seems foreign to us for reasons beyond the state of the economy or the job market. Many middle-class Americans fail absolutely at creating the kind of boundary between work and life that Rath does in the moment he rejects his promotion. That our lives are defined by work is a common notion in our culture, instilled in us when we\u2019re asked what we want to be when we grow up as kids, confirmed by quizzes in high school social studies that tell us what career we\u2019re most suited for, and set in place by the stresses of choosing a major in university.", "I have a theory that whatever office layout is trendy is what the average kindergarten classroom was when the designers and managers were young kids. Hence tech startups with slides and four desks pushed together like a \"table.\" And naptime.", "", "-Princess Toadstool", "", "", "", "The men and women who dominate Saval\u2019s story are similarly work-obsessed. They are theorists, innovators, and consultants who tackle the problem of the unsatisfied employee in one way: by attempting to make work as comfortable to live in as possible. Yet most of us have probably worked jobs that would never be satisfying, regardless of what perks came with them. As a university student, I spent one summer working at a supermarket. Most of my memories from that job are of interminable shifts and downcast co-workers, with the exception of one department manager\u2014one Tom Rath, you might say\u2014who had spent years at the company but had an upbeat energy distinctly different from anyone else with the same level of seniority. The reason for that became clear when I talked to him about Don DeLillo, about journalism, about things that had nothing to do with putting merchandise on the shelves. Evidently, all these activities outside of work were what actually mattered to him.", "If the job market is set to remain as unpredictable and insecure as we\u2019re watching it become, then putting all our emotional stock in our work life will become increasingly unsatisfying. Of course, none of this is meant to dismiss the grave issue of unemployment and underemployment that\u2019s affecting so many today. But reading", ", and seeing people from 20, 50, and 100 years ago suffering the same workplace woes that we face today, should make us consider trying to change the story we tell: to remove work as the paragon of our day-to-day life. The fact of the matter is much like Lester Freamon put it in", ": \u201cThe job will not save you.\u201d To which I might add: Certainly not in this economy.", "---", "by Nikil Saval.
