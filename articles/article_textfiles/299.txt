Despite its age, despite a bad 1964 film adaptation featuring (predictably) a white actress playing Karana, and despite dramatic changes in what cultural arbiters view as acceptable portrayals of Native peoples, the novel remains a fixture on school reading lists.

In 1814, her people (usually called the Nicole\u00f1os, after the name the Spanish gave to the island) clashed violently with Kodiak Islanders from Alaska, Natives who were conscripted by the Russian American Company to hunt otter in the kelp forests off the island\u2019s coast. A massacre ensued, and 20 years later a ship from Mexican California arrived at San Nicolas to bring the remnants of the community to the mainland. According to dubious popular accounts, one woman leapt from the deck of the departing ship upon learning that her child had been left behind. After the child was killed by a pack of feral dogs, she lived on San Nicolas alone for 18 years, until an expedition led by the explorer George Nidever persuaded her to leave the island for the Santa Barbara Mission, where she was baptized and christened Juana Maria. Authorities were unable to locate anyone who could speak her language. She died, from obscure causes, seven weeks later.", "O\u2019Dell\u2019s novel compresses the interval between the massacre and the evacuation to a single year and makes Karana a 12-year-old who jumps overboard to rejoin her little brother.

At first, Karana vows revenge on the pack of wild dogs that killed her brother, and she takes out a half-dozen of its members. Finally, one of her arrows strikes her archnemesis, the gray-furred, yellow-eyed leader of the pack, a creature she believes was brought to the island by the otter hunters who killed her father. But when the moment comes to finish him off with a final shot, Karana can\u2019t do it: \u201cI stood on the rock with the bow pulled back and my hand would not let it go.\u201d She brings the dog to the house she\u2019s built and nurses him back to life.

Wasn\u2019t it awfully traumatic, a story about being abandoned by your entire family? That pulled me up short; in decades of loving the book, it had never occurred to me to see it in that light. Instead what I saw was an intrepid heroine, living\u2014thriving, in fact\u2014by her own wits and courage, accompanied by an assortment of animal pals. Karana even befriends a sea otter\u2014what could be better than", "? As the new edition confirms, different readers see very different things in the book, partly because the novel, unlike so much children\u2019s fiction, doesn\u2019t instruct readers on how to interpret it. O\u2019Dell\u2019s style is notably spare; when Karana does refer to her own loneliness and grief, it comes in a strategically placed line or two. As a child, I could easily overlook this; to an adult reader, the restraint multiples the novel\u2019s power: \u201cI came to the mound where my ancestors had sometimes camped in the summer,\u201d Karana relates after the rescue ship finally arrives. \u201cI thought of them and of the happy times spent in my house on the headland, of my canoe lying unfinished beside the trail. I thought of many things, but stronger was the wish to be where people lived, to hear their voices and their laughter.\u201d", "O\u2019Dell was 60 when he wrote", "a veteran of the early film industry, in which he worked as a cameraman, and the newspaper business. He thought like a reporter, working, as Sara Schwebel\u2019s introduction to the new reader\u2019s edition details, from multiple primary and secondary sources on the Lone Woman and the indigenous peoples of the Channel Islands. He also ran early drafts of the novel past friends involved in the nascent academic discipline of anthropology. But next to nothing is known about the Nicole\u00f1os. The Lone Woman\u2019s neighbors and relatives dispersed into the general population of California, and anyone who recalled their language, history, or beliefs did not write any of it down. O\u2019Dell combined legends and customs from nearby peoples on the Channel Islands and the mainland, and he describes some of the region\u2019s artifacts, like the pitch-lined baskets used to carry water, in careful detail.

An essay, \u201cA Counterstory of Native American Persistence\u201d by Carole Goldberg, included in this new edition, labels the novel a \u201cvanishing Indian\u201d narrative, a story of \u201cthe extinction or complete assimilation of the peoples who occupied North America before Europeans invaded,\u201d and treats such disappearances as a sad, sentimental inevitability. But to support this view, Goldberg has to lean heavily on O\u2019Dell\u2019s brief author\u2019s note, in which he reports that the Lone Woman\u2019s people \u201chad long since disappeared\u201d by the time she reached Mission Santa Barbara. The novel itself, narrated by Karana, ends with her boarding the ship she hopes will reunite her with her family and former neighbors, looking forward to a new life, with Rontu\u2019s pup by her side.", "On the other hand, the notion, cherished by many educators, that", "represents an advance for diversity in children\u2019s literature also seems like a species of wishful thinking. It isn\u2019t really a novel about being Nicole\u00f1o or Native American because those identities have little meaning for Karana once she gets left behind. Above all,", "is a novel about being alone, and cultural identity becomes vaporous when you have nobody to share it with. The diction O\u2019Dell chose for Karana\u2019s voice\u2014unsophisticated but not simple, bluntly practical yet infused with significance\u2014may remind some critics of the terse, article-free English spoken by stereotypical \u201cmovie Indians,\u201d but its closest family resemblance is to Hemingway, another novelist with a newspaper background. It isn\u2019t hunter-gatherers who fantasize about a rugged individual\u2019s life triumphing in a battle against nature, after all.

She notes that O\u2019Dell, writing during the peak of the Cold War, played up the role of Russian colonialism in the depredation of the island and the massacre of Karana\u2019s fellow villagers. But she misses a far more significant parallel in the dilemma the islanders face after the Russian-led trappers slaughter most of the village\u2019s able-bodied men. The old man who takes charge proclaims that \u201cthe women, who were never asked to do more than stay at home, cook food, and make clothing, now must take the place of the men and face the dangers which abound beyond the village.\u201d As a result, Karana pointedly reports, the women work so hard that the village \u201cfared better than when the hunting was done by men.\u201d The remaining men, predictably, take exception to this, complaining \u201cthat the women had taken the tasks that were rightfully theirs and now that they had become hunters the men looked down on them.\u201d", "has often been celebrated for its portrayal of a strong female character, but no one, that I can find, has noted the marked parallels between this part of Karana\u2019s story and American life during and just after World War II.", "In a way,", "also anticipates the post-apocalyptic narratives that are a staple of publishing for young readers today.

Its value had nothing to do with the lessons on cultural representation and feminism it supposedly imparts, just as the pathos I find in Karana\u2019s story as an adult transcends any vanishing Indian clich\u00e9; it is entirely particular to her because her experience, the Lone Woman\u2019s experience, is so extraordinary. The bacon strips I hung out to dry on my makeshift backyard racks were the closest thing to abalone that I could find in our refrigerator; they were not, of course, like the protected mollusk at all.
