Chua has now become something of a brand, a polarizing figure loved or hated because of her views on the link between culture and success. Rubenfeld (Chua\u2019s husband and Yale colleague) is a provocateur in his own right, having authored", ". But this book\u2019s most distinctive feature is Chua\u2019s stock-in-trade: the claim that group cultures explain why those groups are winners.", "The academic community has uniformly dismissed Chua\u2019s recent work with much eye rolling, even as Chua and Rubenfeld are laughing all the way to the bank. To be fair,", "is a trade book for a trade press, written in a lively style accessible to Chua\u2019s earlier readers. Still, the authors push their academic bona fides on", ", and", "as scholarly proof that culture explains persistent racial gaps", ". For those reasons, it\u2019s important to give the book\u2019s argument the scrutiny that Chua and Rubenfeld have invited.", "Here is the book\u2019s thesis: Some groups (Cubans, Nigerians, Mormons, Jews, some Asian groups, south Asian Indians, and Iranians) have experienced upward mobility in the U.S. at higher rates because they possess three cultural qualities: impulse control, feelings of superiority, and feelings of inferiority. By impulse control, they mean the ability to resist temptation (to quit, for example); superiority and inferiority appear to be a simultaneous belief in your group\u2019s specialness (e.g., God\u2019s chosen people) and deep-seated anxiety about inadequacy, the kind that a Chinese mother might instill in her daughter by calling her", ".", "These cultural traits are the ticket to success. Being Latino is no impediment, Chua and Rubenfeld argue, since Cubans can make it. Nor is being black, if Nigerians can do well (though the authors disclaim these comparisons on", "). The Triple Package is available to everyone.", "The problem with the thesis is that in setting out their claim, the authors ignore the more obvious explanation for differences in group success: history. To be specific, in their quest to make it all about culture, the authors either ignore or strongly discount the particular circumstances of a group\u2019s first arrival, and the advantages enjoyed by that first wave.", "Plus there\u2019s that pesky issue of race.", "It turns out that a group\u2019s immigration history explains differences in achievement much better than does the", "theory. For many groups, like Cubans and Mormons, the early wave was a select group endowed with some significant material or nonmaterial resources\u2014wealth, education, or maybe a government resettlement package. For other groups, like Nigerians and south Asian Indians, student and employment-based visas have helped to select a rarefied cross section of people with English skills and educations, making it difficult to now conclude much about the larger groups\u2019 cultural traits. The degree of selectiveness that immigration law imposes has varied highly from group to group.", "\u2019s minimizing of history is a bit curious, given that many of the authors\u2019 own sources favor this explanation. Here are some of the early-wave stories that the authors could have told but didn\u2019t:", "First-wave advantage is significant. As I have argued", ", wealth and education for early waves generate significant advantage for group members and their children. Social networks among the elite and well educated help to distribute social assistance, job referrals, financial opportunities, information, and other kinds of goodies not available to people outside the group.", "What about the later-coming waves, who came with far less wealth? If the magical Triple Package of traits is the explanation, then the later waves should look very much like the first waves at the same stage of development. But if the story is really about wealth and history, then we should see different trajectories for the later waves. Which of course is precisely what we see. Again, a few stories illustrate the point:", "Acknowledging these differences, Chua and Rubenfeld still hold fast to culture but are forced now to slice and dice the argument, to claim that \u201ccultural subdivisions within categories \u2026 can have dramatic effects on group success.\u201d The argument starts to unravel, becoming less an argument about group culture and more a claim about cherry-picked sub-subgroups (a restricted range of south Asians; Cubans, but not the black ones; Mormons, but not the black or brown ones) or even individuals at the right time period with the right traits.", "Plus there\u2019s that pesky issue of race.", "What about Mexicans and U.S.-born black descendants of slaves? Which story better explains their trajectory? Compare the wealth of native black and Mexican first waves to that of, say, the elite first-wave Cubans and the preselected subgroup of Nigerians. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Mexicans had no real first wave; they were here before the Anglos, and their land was stolen by the U.S. None of the Mexican waves has been elite or prosperous, nor for that matter, benefited from a government resettlement package. And the early waves of African-Americans came not on student diversity visas but as slaves, chattel property earning nothing.", "What might the U.S.-born African-American metrics have looked like if former slaves had actually been given their 40 acres and a mule?
