The latest writer to use Yates\u2019 learned and beautifully written book as an imaginative springboard is the British philosophy professor Simon Critchley, whose new novel,", ", is the faux memoir of a philosopher who believes he has learned the exact hour, place, and cause of his own death.", "Yates, who was born in 1899 and wrote most of her major works in her 60s, had no formal education until she enrolled at the University College London in the early 1920s. (Her father, a shipbuilder, was also self-educated, having taught himself to read.) After getting an M.A. in French, she worked as an independent scholar, publishing books on Renaissance history and culture while caring for her ailing parents, until she found an intellectual home at the Warburg Institute, an interdisciplinary research institution loosely affiliated with the University College. \u201cWarburgian history,\u201d as Yates called it, sought to transcend nationalism by emphasizing pan-European ideas and culture. This unifying dream was exactly what Yates needed, in her head and in her heart. The two world wars had traumatized her\u2014her brother was killed in the first, and her father during the Blitz, while Yates herself volunteered as an ambulance attendant\u2014exacerbating her already melancholy temperament.", "Yates\u2019 illustrious friends included the likes of Franz Boas, Ernst Gombrich, and Hugh Trevor-Roper, as well as several close female companions, but she never married or had any romantic relationship that we know of. (Her diaries contain oblique references to an early devastating \u201cevent.\u201d) A former student remarked, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an interesting life in the emotional or physical sense, only in the mental,\u201d but", "disagrees, describing Yates as a solitary yet \u201cpassionate\u201d figure who fits in \u201cthe long line of independent women historians of the Victorian Age who researched and wrote history on their own, outside the constraints of formal education from which they usually were excluded.\u201d Yates, Jones also writes, was a \u201cdepressive, moody, frequently unhappy woman whose salvation until her death was incessant work and an intense spiritual life.\u201d She died in 1981.", "Above all, Yates conveys the excitement of intellectual discovery and deduction.", "Though her fellow historians view Yates\u2019 1964 book", "as her greatest achievement, it is Yates\u2019 book on memory that has proved to be her most popular work by far. In researching Bruno\u2014a renegade Dominican monk, metaphysician, and memory expert who was burned alive in 1600 in the Campo de\u2019 Fiori in Rome\u2014Yates recalled seeing other instances of sophisticated memory techniques mentioned in medieval and early Renaissance texts. Surely they were connected?", "culminates with Bruno, who took the memory arts to their limits, but it also follows the roots of the memory palace all the way back to the Greek poet Simonides, who first developed the idea of using spatial imagination to retain information. Simonides had just left a dinner party in a stately home when the roof collapsed, crushing all the remaining guests beyond recognition. Because he could recall where each person was sitting when he left, Simonides was able to identify all of their corpses, and in that recognized the mnemonic power to be found in conjuring mental images of space.", "A memory palace, or \u201cmethod of loci,\u201d was at first mainly used to memorize speeches (the most important part of a Greek or Roman citizen\u2019s public life). To make one, you picture a multiroomed building (it\u2019s easiest if it\u2019s somewhere familiar, like your family home), and place symbols of each point you want to make in each room. If you want to start out talking about crop yields, you might imagine bags of grain in the foyer, then a fierce bandit in the next room if you want to move on from there to declaim on law and order. Typically, though, the symbols used were strange and striking, weird allegorical and pagan figures filled with hidden meanings that overflowed into the art of late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Yates argues that such devices as the Seven Deadly Sins and the structure of hell, purgatory, and heaven in Dante\u2019s", "are mnemonic icons and systems that had become infused with mystical import.", "Very skilled practitioners of such methods can use them to remember astounding amounts of information\u2014and do so to this day, as Joshua Foer recounts in his 2011 book", ", about his foray into the world of competitive memorization. But as the centuries passed, the art of memory became more than just a tool for many of its practitioners. Yates writes of Giulio Camillo\u2019s \u201cmemory theater,\u201d a concept that expressed the metaphysical and supernatural beliefs with which the memory arts had become saturated during the Middle Ages. Instead of moving through the architectural space of a palace, in the memory theater, the \u201caudience,\u201d which consists of one person, stands still in the exact center. The viewer looks out upon a tiered auditorium of rigidly ordered symbols and cues designed to call forth absolutely everything he has ever known\u2014and perhaps even more. (You can see a video of a 3-D rendering of Camillo\u2019s theater", ".) To master such complete memory device would be to approach divinity.", "Camillo, Yates writes, \u201cwas one of those people whom their contemporaries regard with awe as having vast potentialities.\u201d And, like most people of this type, he accomplished very little and was largely forgotten (until the publication of", "). It is his idea for a physical manifestation of the human brain at its most advanced that fascinates the narrator of Critchley\u2019s Memory Theater. The narrator actually builds one of these structures, which sounds daft until you learn that Camillo did, too, or at least a model of one. (He refused to divulge its true workings to anyone but the king of France, his patron.) The model, never finished, was big enough to fit two people and was \u201cmarked with many images and full of little boxes,\u201d according to one first-hand observer. The narrator of Critchley\u2019s Memory Theater may not have a royal patron, but he does manage to complete his auditorium, which is just big enough to squeeze in one man and contains everything he knows about philosophy.", "What drives him to this project are several boxes of documents he discovers while cleaning out an old academic office. These turn out to have belonged to his dead mentor, and one contains a sheaf of charts in the form of concentric circles pierced by irregularly spaced lines radiating out like spokes. While they look like birth charts (his mentor was that rare philosopher with a keen interest in astrology), they are in fact the opposite. Each chart is devoted to a particular philosopher and is filled with tiny inscriptions listing such life events as publications, weddings, and the birth of children. To his astonishment, the narrator realizes that some of these charts accurately record events that happened after his mentor\u2019s death. His mentor, therefore, had somehow devised a means of calculating the future. At the center of each chart is a circle in which the time, date, location, and cause of death is noted for each subject, some of the dates having yet to occur. And then the narrator finds his own chart.", "After an interlude of denial and bland hedonism, the narrator finally throws over a great job in New York City and moves to a Podunk town in the Netherlands where he devotes himself to building his memory theater in preparation for the fateful hour. The plan, he explains, is \u201cat the instant of my death, I would have recalled the totality of my knowledge. At the moment of termination, I would have become God-like, transfigured, radiant, perfectly self-sufficient, alpha and omega.\u201d", "As demented as this sounds, it is not so very far from the contemporary notion of uploading one\u2019s mind into the cloud. We are often most unreasonable when we pursue the extremes of rationality, when we decide that knowing everything will allow us to be anything we want and that with our technology we can defy death itself. This was a major theme in Frances Yates\u2019 work: that the Renaissance we once viewed as a repudiation of medieval superstition in favor of reason and humanism was in fact shot through with magical beliefs that continued well into the scientific revolution. (Isaac Newton, after all, practiced alchemy and attempted to decode the date of creation from the Bible.) One reason the history of the art of memory had been nearly lost was because humanist scholars like Erasmus, who hated the Middle Ages, believed that such practices, as Yates put it, \u201cbelonged to the ages of barbarism,\u201d and ought to give way to the age of books.", "Yates, if she was anything at all, was a child of the age of books, and the mother of at least two great ones.", ", despite being a work of great erudition spanning several languages, cultures, and historical periods, has a marvelous fluid clarity rare in contemporary histories written at the same scholarly level. Yates describes Bruno and Camillo as if they were people she\u2019d just missed meeting but had heard a lot about, friends of her parents, say. Her empathy for their spiritual yearning animates the book without ever trumping her rigor. And above all, she conveys the excitement of intellectual discovery and deduction, as she carefully unearths the strands of a strange, unbroken tradition lying concealed beneath the conventional story of Western civilization\u2019s stately procession toward the triumph of the Enlightenment.", "Although she is best known for unearthing this long history of the art of memory, Yates never actually learned to perform any of its techniques herself. Instead she plowed forward, reading and writing more and more books and articles. By the time of her death she had buried her beloved brother, both her parents, and two talented sisters who had been the companions of her later years. If she had chosen instead to look back, chances are she would have seen only loss and that mysteriously tragic \u201cevent\u201d of her youth. For someone with her gloomy disposition, this might have seemed too great a risk. Even Frances Yates must have understood that there are times when it\u2019s better just to forget.", "---", "by Frances Yates. Random House (UK).", "by Simon Critchley.
