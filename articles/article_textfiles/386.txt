Kennedy, and Johnson\u2019s ascension and first actions as president\u2014is something else.", "On the good side (which is considerable), and like all the others, it is a terrific read. Caro paints palpable scenes and draws vivid characters. His account of why Kennedy picked LBJ as his running mate is compelling, as is his case that, had JFK lived, he probably would have dropped Johnson from the ticket in \u201964. His detailed description of how Johnson manipulated the Senate to pass a tax cut and the Civil Rights Act\u2014bills that JFK had sent up but would never have pushed through on his own (because he didn\u2019t understand the Senate the way LBJ did)\u2014is gripping.", "But two things make this book less essential than the others. First, unlike the other volumes, the era it treads is hardly unpaved territory. One of Caro\u2019s major themes\u2014the hatred between Johnson and Robert Kennedy\u2014was the topic of Jeff Shesol\u2019s 1997", ". The once-secret tape recordings, which serve as Caro\u2019s source for LBJ\u2019s wheeling and dealing in his first months as president, were transcribed and annotated by Michael Beschloss in", ". Caro writes up this material with more verve and unfurls new details, but, for reasons beyond his control, Vol. 4 doesn\u2019t provide a whole new look at an era the way his earlier volumes did.", "But my second problem is much more serious: Caro\u2019s treatment of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis\u2014and of the roles that Johnson and the Kennedy brothers (especially Robert Kennedy) played in the crisis\u2014is, on several levels,", ".", "I find it unsettling to write that sentence. After all, this is", "we\u2019re talking about: the investigative historian with the gnawing need to hunt down every source and unearth every detail of a story before committing it to type, the man who has often proclaimed, as his credo in research, \u201c", "\u201d", "And yet, when it came to the defining episode of JFK\u2019s presidency, a pivotal moment in Cold War history, the closest that the United States and the Soviet Union ever came to nuclear war, Caro left", "\u2014whole documents\u2014unturned, unread, unopened. Either that, or (a more troubling and, my guess is, less likely possibility) he chopped and twisted the record to make it fit his narrative.", "This point is not a disagreement about interpretation; it is a statement of fact. Like Johnson and Nixon after him, John F. Kennedy surreptitiously recorded conversations of historic consequence\u2014including the 13 days in October 1962 when his top advisers, assembled as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (or ExComm), discussed what to do about the nuclear missiles that the Soviets were erecting 90 miles off the coast of Florida. These tapes have long since been declassified and publicly released, so we know exactly who said what at those sessions. And these hard facts are, in crucial ways, different from the story that Caro (along with, to be fair, many other historians) tells.", "The crisis began when U.S. spy planes detected Soviet ships carrying missiles to Cuba, as well as the construction of missile-launchers at secured sites on the island. At first, JFK and his advisers figured they\u2019d have to bomb the missile sites\u2014until they calculated the complexities and risks, at which point Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara suggested a naval blockade of the island as a way to buy time and give Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev a chance to reverse course. After 13 days of shrewd diplomacy, a deal was struck, and the missiles were withdrawn.", "Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images.", "In the 50 years since, the story and the lessons of the crisis have gone through a fascinating evolution.", "In the first phase, as reported by JFK\u2019s favored columnists (and formalized in the books by palace guards, speechwriter Ted Sorensen\u2019s", "and White House gadfly Arthur Schlesinger\u2019s", "), JFK won the confrontation through sheer threat of force. As one of the advisers was quoted as saying, \u201cWe went eyeball to eyeball with the Russians\u2014and they blinked.\u201d (This quote, like much else in these accounts, was pure fiction.)", "In the second phase, starting in 1982, on the 20", "anniversary of the crisis, some of JFK\u2019s top advisers\u2014McNamara, Sorensen, national security adviser McGeorge Bundy, and others\u2014confessed, in a article for", "magazine, that Kennedy had made a secret deal: Khrushchev would take the Soviet missiles out of Cuba, and Kennedy, six months later, would take America\u2019s very similar Jupiter missiles out of Turkey. It had always been known that Khrushchev", "such a deal, but the earlier accounts\u2014including Sorensen\u2019s book, and many other books based on it\u2014had reported that Kennedy rejected it. In fact, the advisers now said, Kennedy accepted it, but told both the Russians and the handful of his own advisers whom he let in on the secret never to tell anyone. (The advisers decided to break their silence because they knew the Kennedy Library was about to release the tapes.)", "The third phase began in 1987, with the release of the first tape transcripts, which revealed that the advisers had omitted one key fact in their now-it-can-be-told article for", ": They had all vociferously opposed the trade. JFK stood alone on making a deal with the Soviets\u2014and, in the end, was redeemed.", "For inexplicable reasons, most popular histories of the crisis (and a few academic ones as well) have not incorporated this last revelation. They have neglected, misread, or ignored the evidence that has been out there for the last 25 years.", "And now Robert Caro joins that crowd.", "In Caro\u2019s account of the crisis, Robert Kennedy, the attorney general and president\u2019s brother\u2014once a mean hawk\u2014took a sensitive, dovish turn when facing the abyss, a turn that, over the next few years, humanized his attitude toward politics more broadly. And, in this account, Lyndon Johnson reveals his hawkishness so blatantly that he lost all favor with President Kennedy.", "Caro\u2019s analysis of LBJ\u2019s hawkishness is misleading; his depiction of RFK\u2019s dovishness is untrue.", "On RFK\u2019s alleged change of heart, Caro cites two bits of evidence. First, during a discussion about scenarios for bombing the Soviet missile sites, Bobby passed a note to Jack, saying, \u201cI know now how Tojo felt when he was planning Pearl Harbor.\u201d Second, at a session on Oct. 19, just a few days into the crisis, Bobby drops his earlier support for an air raid, saying, \u201cFor 175 years, we have not been that kind of a country. A sneak attack is not in our tradition.\u201d", "The Tojo note is attributed to Sorensen\u2019s book and, like much else about the crisis in that book, is almost certainly fiction. [", "] Historians at the JFK Library have avidly searched for that note; they cannot find it.

Six days after this session, on Oct. 25, he made the distinction explicit, saying that it might be a good idea to", "Soviet personnel at the Cuban site \u201cto get out of that vicinity in 10 minutes, and", "we go through and knock [out] the base.\u201d", "Caro does not quote this remark.", "In fact, at the same Oct. 19 meeting where he spoke up against a \u201csneak attack,\u201d RFK also said, \u201cIt would be better for our children and grandchildren if we decided to face the Soviet threat, stand up to it, and eliminate it, now. The circumstances for doing so at some future time were bound to be more unfavorable, the risks would be greater, the chances of success less good.\u201d", "Caro does not quote this line either\u2014which, by the way, RFK made", "the disavowal of a \u201csneak attack,\u201d meaning that if Bobby\u2019s heart softened with that comment, it hardened again just minutes later.", "At another meeting (also missing from Caro\u2019s account), when a Soviet ship seemed about to break through the American naval blockade and some of the president\u2019s aides talked about ordering crews to board the vessel, RFK said, \u201cRather than have the confrontation at sea, it might be better to knock out the missile bases as the", "step.\u201d", "On the last day of the crisis, when Khrushchev offered the Cuba-for- Turkey trade, Robert Kennedy argued against the deal. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we can ask the Turks to give up their defense,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, don\u2019t bring in Turkey now. We want to settle [Cuba first],\u201d he said later on. JFK sent his trusted brother Bobby to the Soviet ambassador to accept the deal, though not in writing. But even then, he did so reluctantly. Talking casually with McNamara after the ExComm session, as the tape runs out, Bobby says, \u201cI\u2019d like to take Cuba back. That would be nice.\u201d", "From start to finish, and on several occasions, RFK can be heard on the tapes, and read in the transcripts, arguing not only for an air attack but for an air strike followed by an invasion of the entire island of Cuba. Sheldon Stern, the library\u2019s former chief historian, who has studied the tapes and transcripts more thoroughly than anyone, writes in his forthcoming book", ": \u201cRFK was one of the most consistently hawkish and confrontational members of the ExComm.\u201d", "The same can be said of Lyndon Johnson, who, the few times he did speak up at the ExComm meetings, was (as Caro accurately quotes him) brutally bellicose, calling the president\u2019s patience\u2014his failure to meet Khrushchev\u2019s forceful gestures with immediate force\u2014a sign of \u201cweakness\u201d and \u201cbacking down.\u201d", "But, except in tone, Johnson was no more hawkish than Bobby Kennedy\u2014and, especially on the last day of the crisis, no more hawkish than nearly all the advisers at the table.", "When President Kennedy says he\u2019s disposed to take Khrushchev\u2019s missile trade, McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser, protests (you can hear his voice on the tape, quivering), \u201cI think we should tell you \u2026 the universal assessment of everyone in the government who\u2019s connected with alliance problems: If we appear to be trading the defense of Turkey for the threat in Cuba, we will face a radical decline.\u201d", "McNamara, a key moderate, the advocate of the blockade at the start of the crisis, is an all-out hawk by its final days, arguing\u2014in a bit of crazed logic rivaling Dr. Strangelove\u2019s\u2014that we should remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey but only", "we attack the Soviet missiles in Cuba. (For the full, jaw-dropping quote, taken from the official transcript of the session, which Caro seems not to have read,", ".)", "Many histories of the crisis, especially those written before the tapes were released, portray the ExComm sessions as a struggle between the hawks and the doves. But by the end of the crisis, there were no hawks and doves; there was only President Kennedy, who favored making the trade with the Russians, and everybody else, who loathed the idea. (Near the end, just one adviser, George Ball, who became the house dissident on the Vietnam War during LBJ\u2019s presidency, sided with the president.)", "Bobby Kennedy may have transformed himself later, after his brother was assassinated, but Jack Kennedy emerges as the lone fount of wisdom in the tapes and transcripts.", "Caro misses this fact. The day before Khrushchev offered the Cuba-for-Turkey missile trade, he sent the White House a different proposal: He would remove his missiles from Cuba if Kennedy vowed never to invade Castro\u2019s island. When the missile-trade deal came across the line the next day, many of JFK\u2019s advisers\u2014including RFK\u2014suggested that he accept the", "letter\u2019s offer and simply ignore the second letter. The books by Sorensen and Schlesinger contend that JFK did precisely that.", "Caro, citing those two books (and interviews he conducted with both authors), writes that the president \u201ckept postponing his decision\u201d on whether to take their advice. In fact, he did nothing of the kind. The moment Khrushchev\u2019s second letter came over the wire, JFK said, \u201cTo any man at the United Nations, or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\u201d", "Kennedy let his advisers\u2014RFK, McNamara, Bundy, Dean Rusk, and others\u2014rail against the idea for a while, then said, calmly, \u201cNow let\u2019s not kid ourselves. Most people think that if you\u2019re allowed an even trade, you ought to take advantage of it.\u201d", "This discussion was taking place on a Saturday morning. The Joint Chiefs had drawn up a plan for striking the missiles\u2014with 500 air sorties\u2014and mounting an invasion the following Monday. JFK mused, \u201cI\u2019m just thinking about what we\u2019re going to have to do in a day or so \u2026 500 sorties \u2026 and possibly an invasion, all because we wouldn\u2019t take the missiles out of Turkey. And we all know how quickly everybody\u2019s courage goes when the blood starts to flow, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in NATO \u2026 when we start these things and the Soviets grab Berlin, and everybody\u2019s going to say, \u2018Well, this Khrushchev offer was a pretty good proposition.\u2019 \u201d", "Even so, the advisers railed against the idea. Finally, Kennedy sent Bobby to meet with the Soviet ambassador and take the deal.", "John Kennedy is the real hero of the Cuban crisis, but Caro misses this because he follows Sorensen and Schlesinger too closely (something he explicitly doesn\u2019t do in other chapters of this book). He even credits Secretary of State Dean Rusk with devising the idea of telling the Soviet ambassador that the United States would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey in six months, as long as the deal isn\u2019t publicized. In fact, this was John Kennedy\u2019s idea.", "Sorensen and Schlesinger, of course, idolized Jack Kennedy. But given the politics of the early \u201960s, JFK", "to put forth the word that he\u2019d stood up to the Soviets with strength, that he hadn\u2019t made a deal. After a while, they came to believe their own myth.", "Caro\u2019s depiction of the crisis fits into the two main strands of his book\u2019s broader narrative: the burning hatred between Johnson and Bobby Kennedy and Johnson\u2019s growing isolation within the Kennedy administration. He writes that, after Johnson\u2019s bellicose display in the ExComm, JFK cut him off even more than before. That may be true, but if it\u2019s because of Johnson\u2019s stance in the crisis, JFK should have distanced himself from Bundy, McNamara, and the others as well.", "I would argue (and here we do get into interpretation, even speculation) that JFK did just that. Over the course of his brief presidency, he came to realize that the smart men all around him weren\u2019t as smart as they seemed. The Bay of Pigs taught him not to believe everything the CIA told him. Discussions about the Laos crisis (during which the Army urged an invasion, the Air Force called for air strikes, and the Navy advocated sending in carriers) taught him that the generals were often self-interested. And the Cuban missile crisis taught him that his brain trust of civilian advisers had their shortcomings, too.", "One of JFK\u2019s deep failures was not letting LBJ in on this emerging wisdom.

My suspicion, inferred from what", "happened in those ExComm meetings, is that JFK would have pulled out of Vietnam\u2014or at least would not have escalated so deeply. The lesson isn\u2019t that Johnson marked a departure from Kennedy\u2019s men; it\u2019s that, when it came to questions of war and Communism, JFK himself was departing from the views of Kennedy\u2019s men.
