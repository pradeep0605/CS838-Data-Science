Sure, that sense of the living moment takes utterly mundane forms at the Renaissance faire: You keep a sharp eye on people because they may be about to diss your codpiece, or unstring your bodice, or worse. Still, the overall effect, not unlike those \u201960\u2019s \u201cbe-ins,\u201d is to ensure that you have some skin in the game.", "Here\u2019s one comparison: Every year my kids spend a week of summer camp at", ", a thoughtful and incredibly sober reconstruction of real village life in southern New England in or about 1831.

But maybe it\u2019s that very indifference to history that makes the place enticing. It doesn\u2019t want to educate you; it wants to suck you in and make you act like someone else for a few hours. That has the somewhat paradoxical effect of making a faire surprisingly like the bumpy, embarrassing, role-reversing bawdiness that played (if I have my history right) such a huge part in medieval carnivals.
