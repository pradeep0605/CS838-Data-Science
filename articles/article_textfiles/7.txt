The words you\u2019re reading are mostly the words of Bartleby\u2019s boss, the lawyer. We never learn his name. He\u2019s pompous and silly and he loves the sound of his own voice. But then he runs up against Bartleby, the blank mystery at the story\u2019s heart, with his absolute refusal to participate in the web of cause and effect that makes narrative possible. The drama of the story is in this peaceful man\u2019s confrontation with that nullity. When you read Melville\u2019s story out loud you inhabit him, you engage in that confrontation yourself, and like him you come away reeling. \u2013", "", "Herman Melville is the author, most recently, of", ".", "Jeff Friedrich is an associate editor at", ".", "Jennifer Lai is an associate editor at", ".", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
