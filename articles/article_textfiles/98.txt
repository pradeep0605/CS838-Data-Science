Children\u2019s literature, in these lights, is a form of art\u2014restricted in its palette, vocabulary, and subject matter, but no different in kind from grown-up literature.", "But when I take my kids to the library or bookstore, the books they gravitate to are not the ones that promise to sensitively represent their inner landscapes. They are the ones with trucks or princesses or superheroes on the covers.", "This is the sad truth of children\u2019s literature, the lesson every parent who loves books learns: What children want to read is often very different from what adults like to think they want.

It\u2019s useful to have something like that to think about while you read, because the books themselves do not reward close attention.

There is so much wrong with this stuff ideologically that it\u2019s easy to overlook just how meager it is aesthetically, what thin gruel for the imagination.

The takeover of the children\u2019s market by licensing reflects capitalism\u2019s love of standardization, which undercuts the higher ideals of art for any age group.
