But then a funny thing happens. As D starts planning the wedding, McCarthy loads up his schedule with trips to far-flung places: Patagonia, the Amazon, Mount Kilimanjaro. \u201cYou do understand\u00a0 that as soon as we decided to get married you\u2019re going as far away as you can get,\u201d his fianc\u00e9e tells him, leading the way toward an", "moment with all the originality and subtlety of a cartoon light bulb.", "McCarthy, it turns out, is", "afraid of commitment. His reticence has to do with a bunch of things: His overbearing father, who has an uncannily Hughesian manner of speech (\u201cNo son of mine is going to be a fucking thespian\u201d); his first marriage, which he found stifling (\u201cI felt like I had to leave 20 percent of myself outside just to walk in the door of our marriage.\u201d); and a (sensitivity-based?) awkwardness that has long caused him to regard himself as a \u201cloner.\u201d There\u2019s more, too. Lots more. And the only way for him to work through it and become a better man, of course, is to set forth on his planned journey\u2014\u201cnot to escape the commitment I recently made,\u201d he tells us, \u201cbut to gain the insight necessary to bring me home.\u201d", "Cue \u201cDesperado\u201d as McCarthy heads off a journey of self-discovery, one that involves much staring into the middle distance, licking of ancient filial wounds, charged but chaste interactions with women with \u201cample breasts,\u201d and of course, pizza.

McCarthy\u2019s editor had it right: He\u2019s not a writer, he\u2019s an actor. That said, the observational skills he\u2019s developed in his primary career are useful when he\u2019s describing the characters he meets on the road, who come alive with just a few gestures, like that editor, \u201ca barrel-chested lion of a man with a mane of silver hair\u201d who agreed to meet him at an East Village bar but clearly didn\u2019t take him at all seriously. \u201cCan you even write?\u201d he asks McCarthy, \u201clooking at a young woman down the bar.\u201d", "Courtesy Simon & Schuster.", "Unfortunately, most of McCarthy\u2019s observations are focused on himself, and his examinations of his own ambivalence are about as interesting as a stoned person\u2019s description of a rug pattern. \u201cGetting married would be an acknowledgement of who I am rather than clinging to what I had,\u201d he thinks at one point.", "On the other hand, I\u2019m an accumulation of all my past, and if in getting married I leave it behind, I don\u2019t know what I take forward.

For the rest of us, a story about a man-child who feels trapped and underappreciated by his family and just wants five minutes to himself is joyless and familiar, like watching a Judd Apatow movie with all of the poop jokes cut out.", "There\u2019s a creepy self-congratulatory undercurrent to these kinds of narratives. Like we\u2019re supposed to be grateful to guys like Andrew McCarthy for laying bare their feelings, for telling us, finally, how it really is.", "", "We\u2019re supposed to applaud them for choosing to be vaguely decent, after long, noble struggles against primordial dickishness . But it's hard to empathize with McMcarthy when he's just \u2026 being a dick.

Written in a spare, semi-detached way\u2014like a trauma victim spitting out details of a tragedy\u2014it suggests Ringwald, too, has been through some real shit since graduating from John Hughes high school. Her second husband, a book editor, may be the reason her prose is so sharp, but let's hope he's not her inspiration.", "We know Phillip is cheating on his wife, Greta, from almost the first page, well before Greta herself finds the evidence in an email and makes him tell her all of the gory details down to the color of his mistress\u2019s pubic hair. We know because Phillip is acting like a dick\u2014remote and snappish. By the time we hear his side of the story, his guilty conscience seems to have driven him to the idea that his infidelity isn\u2019t his but his wife\u2019s fault. If it weren\u2019t for her demands\u2014wanting him to stay home for dinner, wanting to have a second child, wanting him to act like a fucking grown-up\u2014he probably wouldn\u2019t have ever taken up with the 19-year-old piano teacher.

The girl wanted him and that had been enough.", "Photograph by Fergus Greer.", "Of course broken hearts don\u2019t really \u201cclose.\u201d Greta and Phillip's wounds stays open, and radiate pain to everyone close to them, from their daughter to the next man-child who falls in love with Greta, the pot-smoking star of a children\u2019s television program whose heart Greta coolly stomps with a transgression of her own. But Ringwald is thoughtful about the difference between Greta\u2019s betrayal and her new role as betrayer: \u201cShe felt a discomfort that she supposed to be the weight of her guilt, but that was all. It was nothing like what it had felt like to be the one deceived. \u2026 The quality of betrayal is commensurate only to the measure of love for the one you betray.\u201d", "Although they recently exchanged promotional Twitter messages, Ringwald and McCarthy are, per McCarthy\u2019s book, not in touch. So it 's just coincidence that both of their books end with chastened, changed men returning to women, and\u00a0 come to a similar conclusion, which is that real, imperfect relationships are more satisfying than a lifetime spent chasing John Hughes moments. Maybe O.M.D. said it best: \u201cWe\u2019ve always had time on our sides, but now it\u2019s fading fast.
