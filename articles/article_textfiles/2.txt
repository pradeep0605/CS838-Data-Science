The challenge is multilayered: creating a marketable image that pops while also paying tribute to the book\u2019s themes and content, realizing the author\u2019s intended vision, and leaving a distinct artistic stamp.", "There were", ", but some of the covers on display this year were no less impressive. Below are our picks for the 11 best book jackets of 2016, with comments from the designers on how their vision came to fruition, what ideas they were trying to communicate, and how satisfied they were with the end result.", "is beautifully written, but also dark and strange\u2014sometimes disturbing.", "", "Odd and dreamlike passages from the book offered plenty of inspiration for the cover design. While working on this, I tried to focus on creating a cover that was true to the story, but also not too off-putting to potential readers. After reading", ", you perceive the cover that we ended up with as maybe a little bit literal. Normally that is something that I like to avoid, but I think it works in this case because of how surreal the writing is.", "Another direction that I pursued was this idea of a humanlike vase that I thought could represent the protagonist and her transformation throughout the book. This second option was presented as more of a sketch and it was never fully realized because everyone was leaning toward the red design that ended up being the final cover. The author also liked it, and this was a rare occasion where the design from the first round made it through the approval process without any changes.", "This book is an investigation of the female trainwreck: how she came to be, how she evolved, and what she means in today\u2019s climate of tabloids and social media. One of the first steps in my design process is to identify the tone of the book: dry or humorous, bold or delicate, conceptual or literal, or various combinations of the above. At some point I realized that I couldn\u2019t get too clever or too pretty with this cover. The book\u2019s subject matter and writing style are very bold and to the point; there was no room for humorous interpretations, which had been my initial approach.", "One thing I decided on right away was typography: to apply a typeface widely used in tabloid print. This led to the look and placement of boxes and frames throughout, as well as the color scheme. Then I played with the idea of using an image of a broken doll, but discovered that the doll took away from the book\u2019s serious subject of a woman being scrutinized by the public for being too bold, too sexy, too unapologetic, too much the opposite of what\u2019s considered \u201cgood girl\u201d behavior. I ended up with a photograph of a blond woman blocking cameras away from her face. Then I added a TV screen over the image, and made it monochromatic in order to not distract from what had to be paid close attention to.", "In reference to his own work in progress, Mike (the main character of", ") talks about wanting to \u201cexpress those negative spaces between two bodies, where the relationship breathes \u2026 belly-to-belly with the intimacy of a stabbing.\u201d I think the same can be said about", ". The design is meant to embody Mike\u2019s raw and visceral storytelling, and reveal an immediate sense of intimacy and horror.", "Like a mixtape,", "shifts back and forth through different moments in Mike\u2019s life. Rather than visually limiting the scope of the book to one scene, the cover is a collage of the various vignettes that the author provided. Accordingly, I tried to design it in a way that reflected the book\u2014a mixtape of text and imagery.", "Problem-solving is always a big part of creating a cover image, but what made this particular project so unique is that it felt like solving a mystery. The main difference was that the text was not yet finished when we started. We had some clues from Margaret Atwood: It\u2019s set in prison; there\u2019s been a storm and the lights have gone off; some of the main themes deal with magic, illusion, and theater. Since the novel was a contemporary interpretation of a classic Shakespearean play, the cover also had to combine the past with the present.", "Based on those clues, I produced about six completely different drafts\u2014some were focused on the main character and some on the setting and overall feel. For one cover in the second round of drafts, I zoomed in on the eye of", "and that became our solution: It introduced some of the main themes of the book\u2014solitude, fear, and threat\u2014without being too literal and giving too much away.", "Maria Semple\u2019s sense of humor about her protagonist made me think immediately of", "\u2019s work, of which I\u2019m a huge fan\u2014it\u2019s smart, funny, and intriguing all at the same time. The main character of the book uses \u201cToday Will Be Different\u201d as a sort of mantra\u2014willing it to happen\u2014so repeating the title in text made sense to me. I also did a version where the whole mantra was written out diary-style, and at first, there was some hesitation about the gray background, so I was asked to mock up some other versions of the girl. None of them were nearly as compelling as Geoff\u2019s original painting, however.", "There were a few other designs in the running, some playing into the sense of the character throwing up her hands and crying uncle, others showing her crazy path through the city. Luckily, in the end, everyone came back around to Geoff\u2019s painting. And Semple wrote the repeating title out in her own handwriting for the final jacket as the finishing touch!", "I\u2019ve been fortunate to design the covers for most of Jonathan\u2019s books. This was by far the hardest. In fact, it\u2019s probably one of the hardest jobs I have ever worked on. It took more than 80 visuals to get to this final cover. We tried a lot of different ideas, none of which quite clicked. At one point I was taken off the job, and I resigned myself to the fact that perhaps, after 15 years, it was time for a change and a fresh pair of eyes, and that our working relationship was sadly over. Then to my huge relief, Jonathan and his U.K. editor Simon came back to me with a brainwave, and we started work on the text-based cover.", "The artwork itself ended up being 6 feet long and 3 feet high, with more than 1,000 painted words. I had to paint it again from scratch when the final edit came in, and then correct it when it had been copy edited. I went through an awful lot of paint, board, and wrist pain.", "I think it fits the book pretty well. The detail and meaning of the words merge, and you are left with a colorful, textural wall. The novel refers a lot to division and separation, to boundaries and to walls. It looks deceptively simple and straightforward for something that took more than a year, but it has a personality and weight of its own, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve always tried for with Jonathan\u2019s covers. I think we got there in the end.", "In", ", Nadja Spiegelman delves into the complex relationships she has with the women in her family. Through this memoir, they all confront their past, and it is beautifully painful, vulnerable, and profound. I wanted the cover to feel personal yet relatable.", "Initially, the cover only had a cigarette. We added a hand later in the process, adding a human element. For me, the act of smoking conveys a sense of reflection, as well as rebellion\u2014the internal and outward battles these women fight.", "The idea for this cover was to create sort of a visually onomatopoeic type of alteration: The title", "would feel as though it gets more \u201cshrill\u201d toward the end\u2014as is often the conversational tendency with shrillness. It was a lucky moment with the shapes of the letters, in the word easily lending itself to what I thought of as \u201cshrill-ification\u201d\u2014a simple height alteration, to create a typographic image that alludes to increasing volume or pitch.", "My initial sketches for the cover were, stylistically, more retro and minimalist, but it went through several rounds of marketing dissection and any variety of other mysterious things that go on behind the scenes after a design gets pitched. In the end it\u2019s a different cover\u2014and, in my opinion, not as elegantly handled. But I\u2019m probably the only one who thinks so, being so close to it and having personal feelings about how I\u2019d have liked it to look. The initial impact of the idea survived in the final design.", "by Nicole Dennis-Benn is a visually and emotionally lush novel that takes place in Jamaica, and follows the lives of two sisters (one adult, one still in school) and their mother. In it, we get a sense of classism and racism as well as a societal pressure to fit into a fairly rigid and small community.", "I began researching Jamaican dancehall posters for color, composition, and typography. I was also looking at a lot of Kara Walker\u2019s antebellum artwork and then doing research based on the description of the houses, beach coves, characters, and so forth. The art director and I had settled into the Kara Walker approach for some time before we swung back to the dancehall-style typography, and a more editorial illustration. While I was rooting for", ", I understood that this needed a more commercial package. This direction also made sense conceptually, as the youngest daughter was struggling to become a painter, so approaching it more figuratively, in the end, felt appropriate.", "With obvious reason, everyone in-house was unable to contain their excitement for this book. I will say that it is rare to get to work on the art for a contemporary novel that is so clearly marked as a masterpiece.", "The final version of the jacket was put together after several missteps. I\u2019d originally planned to make the cover a bit more unconventional, but my attempts failed to depict a gravitas commensurate with the text (admittedly an impossible task). What we settled on was a design that wouldn\u2019t alienate readers with any of the designer\u2019s pretensions, one that spoke more to the dignity of the book. Simply reifying the railroad\u2014the fulcrum of the novel itself\u2014was enough to hint at the book\u2019s wonderful strangeness, without revealing too much. The subterranean tracks and the implied digging work on multiple levels as the text does, and this proved an ideal entry point into the alternate world that Colson so exceptionally brings to life.", "This drawing was done in August 2008 while I was working as an architectural intern, living in New York City for the first time. Christodora House, with its tower form looming over Tompkins Square Park, was a regular object of my attention while I lived nearby, at the corner of 7th Street and Avenue B. At the time I was doing lots of cityscape drawings, and Christodora\u2019s scale over the surrounding neighborhood\u2014its unembellished brick mass rising upward and topped off with stepped terraces\u2014always held my attention while wandering the blocks below. The vantage point of my drawing foregrounds the tower into its neighborhood context of St. Brigid\u2019s church, school, and Tompkins Square Park.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
