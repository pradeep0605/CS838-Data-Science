{"Body": ["Illustration by Fumio Obata", "Joshua Levin is not David Justice or Steve Austin or The Rock. It is not a name that conveys strength or courage or any other quality associated with rough-hewn masculinity. It is the name of a nebbish, a man who spends his days staring at a laptop screen and whose work output is, at best, one non-atrocious phrase per day. It is the name of a man who is his own worst enemy, and whose self-defeating behavior is devastatingly banal. Joshua Levin doesn\u2019t dodge bullets; he dodges distractions on the Internet. The biggest risk to his health is the dreaded \u201cinadvertent self-wedgie.\u201d", "is", "\u2019s\u00a0executive editor.", "Such are the struggles of Joshua Levin, the unintentionally testicle-mangling, overbite-having protagonist of Aleksandar Hemon\u2019s novel", ".

Reilly felt if such a person ever existed, and I\u2019m kind of surprised to report that, according to the online public records search that I just did for no good reason, there are flesh-and-blood people named Ignatius J. Reilly in Louisiana, Georgia, Texas, and Massachusetts. Like I was saying, Joshua Levin doesn\u2019t dodge bullets. He dodges distractions on the Internet.", "But really, honestly, I don\u2019t have that much in common with Aleksandar Hemon\u2019s Joshua Levin, the thirtysomething screenwriter with \u201cthe body of a lightweight wrestler who\u2019d quit wrestling after middle school.\u201d I am my very own Josh\u2014hold the -ua, we\u2019re all friends here\u2014Levin, a thirtysomething journalist with the body of a malnourished basketball player who never played basketball.

It is also a breezy and funny examination of what happens when a man who\u2019s \u201chungry for notable experiences\u201d doesn\u2019t anticipate the consequences of acquiring those experiences. And it\u2019s about zombies, who are less hungry for notable experiences than they are for brains.", "Hemon\u2019s Levin is a familiar character even for those who don\u2019t share his Semitic surname. An unremarkable man who\u2019s highly aware of his unremarkableness, he can\u2019t fathom why his girlfriend likes him but understands very well why his dreams of Hollywood success remain unfulfilled. For one thing, he can\u2019t finish a screenplay. For another, his scripts are terrible, whether they\u2019re populated by an elderly contract killer, a misfit DJ, or the flesh-eating, virus-infected zombies that appear in regular between-chapter interludes.

This truism is what leads Hemon\u2019s Levin astray. Given his blanketed existence, he assumes that his own decisions will be just as inconsequential as the ones he\u2019s putting down on the page\u2014that nothing he can do will have the power to rip off that down-filled comforter.", "One Levin to another, I can assure you, poor dumb Joshua, that a blanket is easier to dislodge than it seems\u2014when you wake up in the morning, that thing is always on the floor.
