{"Body": ["John Martz", "The opening sentence of Emily Witt\u2019s", "\u201cI was single, straight, and female\u201d\u2014might, in a different sort of book, set the reader up for the narrator\u2019s quest to transcend the first element of that self-identification. The condition of singleness, after all, is traditionally understood as a sort of existential antechamber to the Valhalla of marriage, or of otherwise \u201csettling down.\u201d Early in life, the single person is thought of as not yet settled down; as he or she ages, this becomes seen as a failure to do so.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "In the early pages of her book, Witt writes of turning 30, and of conceiving of her singleness as an interim state; she describes a condition of objectless longing, a special form of loneliness that can only be generated by the technologies of connection. \u201cI stared at rippling ellipses on screens,\u201d she writes. \u201cI forensically analyzed social media photographs. I expressed levity with exclamation points, spelled-out laughs, and emoticons. I artificially delayed my responses. There was a great posturing of busyness, of not having noticed your text until just now.\u201d Her friends express a quasi-mystical belief that she will indeed find love, or be found by it, and cease to be a soul \u201cflitting through limbo [...] awaiting the brass trumpets and wedding bells of the eschaton.\u201d", "There\u2019s probably no need for a spoiler alert in my telling you that the pages of", "at no point resound with any such trumpets or bells. Despite her irresistible title, Witt isn\u2019t primarily interested in the future\u2014either her own, or that of sex and relationships in general. Which is not to suggest that she isn\u2019t anxiously curious about these matters, but rather that her book is an attempt to encounter singleness on its own terms, as a mode of being in the world\u2014or the world, at any rate, as it\u2019s presently experienced by more or less young, more or less privileged, and more or less straight Americans.", "\u201cI stared at rippling ellipses on screens,\u201d Witt writes. \u201cI forensically analyzed social media photographs.\u201d", "Although the book is framed by its author\u2019s own experience, it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to describe it as a memoir. The action\u2014and it contains, let me assure you, a great abundance and diversity of action\u2014begins in earnest with Witt leaving New York and striking out West for San Francisco, there to seek her sexual fortune. She begins internet dating, but seems unable to work up the enthusiasm, with any of these algorithmically selected potential mates, for the kind of casual sex that flows naturally enough from going to parties and meeting men IRL. There are more rippling ellipses, more unanswered messages. Witt delicately and skillfully summons the muted mournfulness of these failures to connect, the doubled alienation of technologically mediated distance. OkCupid delivers her a sensitive composer with whom she shares an interest in the poetry of Wallace Stevens and the fiction of Thomas Pynchon, but the encounter fails to develop into anything exciting, and she eventually stops responding to his increasingly plaintive messages. \u201cIn the months that followed,\u201d she writes, \u201che continued to write, long e-mails with updates of his life, and I continued not responding until it came to seem as if he were lobbing his sadness into a black hole, where I absorbed it into my own sadness.\u201d", "Witt\u2019s desire to get beyond this stasis, her curiosity about what it is she really wants, opens out onto a vista of sexual otherness, and an episodic series of journalistic engagements with that otherness. As such, the book is largely comprised of a sequence of more-or-less-standalone essays reporting from various points on the Bay Area sexual panorama. There\u2019s a chapter in which she attends meetings organized by a San Francisco\u2013based group called OneTaste, an apparently thriving business dedicated to the practice and promotion of something called Orgasmic Meditation. This involves a ritual whereby a woman lies down pantsless next to her partner, who must first describe the woman\u2019s vulva in poetic detail and then, wearing a pair of heavily lubricated latex gloves, slowly and gently manipulate the clitoris for precisely 15 minutes before stopping, orgasm or no orgasm, at the behest of an iPhone stopwatch. The whole setup seems weirdly, almost creepily, de-eroticized, and Witt navigates her ambivalence about it with fascinating honesty and deftness. The piece culminates, perhaps inevitably, with her own experience with the practice, under the detached ministrations of one of the organization\u2019s blandly handsome personnel. The episode is literally anti-climactic, and is exemplary of the combination of irony and pathos that makes the book such an astringent pleasure to read:", "Although she is often at the periphery of the action, Witt is mostly central as a nonfiction observer-narrator figure. Even at its funniest (and it\u2019s frequently very funny) there is a curiosity and an openness to her writing that prevents the laughs ever feeling as though they are imposed by force from above. She attends a porno shoot\u2014a hardcore sadomasochistic deal, filmed in front of a crowd, involving the binding and scrupulously staged humiliation of a young woman\u2014and reveals a strange, awkward humanity at work in what might easily be portrayed as a crowd of baying misogynist weirdos. (\u201c \u2018You are beautiful and I\u2019d take you to meet my mother!\u2019 yelled one man who had been particularly enthusiastic about yelling \u2018worthless cunt.\u2019 ... The crowd was drunk and excited, although not entirely unembarrassed. \u2018Make that bitch choke,\u2019 shouted the shouty man. Then: \u2018Sorry!\u2019 \u201d)", "The book\u2019s longest section concerns a group of San Francisco polyamorists, but\u2014like the book as a whole\u2014it just as crucially concerns the culture of boundless optimism and self-enclosed privilege around Bay Area techies. Some of the book\u2019s best writing sees Witt firing on all essayistic cylinders on the peculiarity, and pervasiveness, of this culture:", "Part of what makes", "so compelling, and so fascinating, is the indeterminacy of its author\u2019s own position in relation to the world she\u2019s writing about. She\u2019s usually more than just an observer, but she\u2019s also rarely an insider. (She alludes to this ambivalence from time to time, describing herself at one point as \u201cjust a visitor, or rather neither here nor there, someone undertaking an abstract inquiry but not yet with true intention.\u201d) She\u2019s a little older than this particular group of free-loving techies, but in writing about the people around her, she\u2019s as often as not also writing about herself.", "The book is at its most conventional, and least interesting, during a handful of longish stretches\u2014most notably in that exploration of the polyamorist scene\u2014in which she straightforwardly narrates stories in which she herself has no real personal involvement. There is a subtle drop-off in style and energy in these parts, a kind of journalistic dutifulness which creeps into the writing, and reading them I found myself impatient for Witt to reassert herself as an embodied presence in the book.", "The book\u2019s highpoint comes near the end, in the form of a personal essay about attending Burning Man with a bunch of well-heeled Silicon Valley types\u2014on the face of it, about as unappealing a prospect for a piece of writing as it\u2019s possible to imagine. Not all that much happens: She travels there with a guy she previously hooked up with at a wedding in Portugal; she cycles around; she gets high; she meets a charming anarchist at a pop-up library and they bond over Ursula K. LeGuin and Claude Levi-Strauss; they take a naked steam bath together and eventually have sex (an event which is passed over in decorous silence). But the piece, a version of which previously appeared in the", ", is filled with superb observations, and distinguished by Witt\u2019s characteristic combination of openness and skepticism. Her own experience of the festival is positive and expansive, but she is far from wide-eyed about the utopian pretensions of the techies who have made Black Rock City a holiday outpost of Mountain View, a kind of TEDx Ibiza:", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!

Join us today.", "Witt could be seen as focusing too restrictedly, in these essays, on the experience of a particular social world: The book is peopled overwhelmingly by upper-middle-class heterosexuals. But her own centrality to the stories she is telling, the fact that they all work outward from her inner life, largely exonerates this sociological narrowness. And this personal grounding is, in the end, the book\u2019s greatest strength; it\u2019s Witt\u2019s distinctive presence as an observer and protagonist, in other words, her simultaneous openness and ironic detachment, that makes", "such an engrossing and illuminating experience. By the end of the book, neither Witt\u2019s own future nor that of sex itself seem any closer to being known.
