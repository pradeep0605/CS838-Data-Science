{"Body": ["n her journal in the mid-1960s, Susan Sontag vowed \u201cto give no interviews until I can sound as clear + authoritative + direct as Lillian Hellman in", ".\u201d Sontag\u2019s ongoing investment in the development and definition of herself always seemed less like self-obsession than a kind of existential industriousness. Reading through the odds and ends that have been published since her death almost 10 years ago\u2014the", "of", ", in particular\u2014you get the sense of a person who was always working toward an ideal version of herself. The ideal changed in its particulars over time, but the ideal", "change remained constant. She\u2019s often a reassuringly pretentious figure in the early diaries, which are themselves a useful reminder that being a pseudo-intellectual is a necessary stage on the way to being a nonpseudo-intellectual, and that the two classifications aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive. Being an intellectual is often, after all, a matter of getting away with trying to be seen as one.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "In his introduction to", "Jonathan Cott\u2014whose 1978 interview with Sontag got chopped down by the magazine to one-third of its length\u2014remembers that journal entry, and writes that \u201cas I listened to her clear, authoritative, and direct responses to my questions, it was obvious that she had attained the conversational goal that she had set for herself many years before.\u201d The idea of this persuasive fluency of speech as something constructed, something striven for and achieved, reveals the extent to which Sontag\u2019s position as one of the most public of 20th-century public intellectuals was one she had always wanted to arrive at. As brilliant an essayist as she was, talking brilliantly was almost as significant a part of her job.", "And so the Sontag colloquy shares certain key qualities with the Sontag essay\u2014in particular the magnetic mixture of intellectual self-assurance and relaxed inclusivity. She was a virtuoso of the literary sit-down, working the form into an occasion for informal self-portrait. There\u2019s no one topic that particularly dominates in this 138-page interview, but there are certain themes and preoccupations that assert themselves throughout: the ideal of personal autonomy, the complexities of love and friendship and sexuality, the historical constitution of ideas and behaviors we tend to think of as natural. The interview is from around the time of the publication of", ", and so there\u2019s a fair amount of talk about mortality, and the personal experience of being a cancer patient which informed that book. \u201cWe\u2019re all,\u201d she says at one point, \u201cgoing to die\u2014that\u2019s a very difficult thing to take in\u2014and we all experience this process. It feels as if there\u2019s this person\u2014in your head, mainly\u2014trapped in this physiological stock that can only survive seventy- or eighty-plus years normally, in any kind of decent condition. It starts deteriorating at a certain point, and then for half of your life, if not more, you watch this material begin to fray. And there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. You\u2019re trapped inside it, and when it goes, you go.\u201d", "But it\u2019s Sontag the reader who gets most airtime here\u2014which is to say the critic rather than the novelist (although she would probably have argued the distinction could never hold up). There\u2019s always the sense, with Sontag, of reading as a process of acquisition and assimilation, as a kind of territorial expansionism of the self. All those itemized resolutions in the journals, all those lists of things to be read and absorbed; her project was, as she put it,", "And this is one of the most striking things about her, this conquistadorial spirit brought to bear on a basically democratic sensibility\u2014the famous imperative to be interested in everything. She seems to have read all of Western literature, and to have learned from it everything that might be worth knowing.", "This, of course, is exactly the impression you\u2019d be well advised to start giving off if you wanted to make any kind of impact as a public intellectual. But with Sontag, you suspect that she really", "read everything\u2014and not in the Harold Bloom way, either, where encyclopedic erudition starts to look like a kind of petrification, where the critic manifests himself as the canon made flesh. Change is, for her, the end of reading; what she prizes in literature is its capacity to bring otherness into the self\u2014the paradoxical way in which books take us outside the limits of ourselves while pushing those limits outward. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to me to subscribe to something that\u2019s foreign to my earlier taste,\u201d she says. \u201cNot in an unfriendly spirit with respect to the earlier work\u2014but just because I need new blood and new nourishment and new inspiration. And because I like what I\u2019m not, I like to try to learn what isn\u2019t me or what I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m curious.\u201d", "And that\u2019s one of the more inspiring things about Sontag: the way in which she positions curiosity as not just a primary critical value, but a primary human value. To be curious is, in the most vital sense, to be serious. There\u2019s another wonderful moment, later on, when Cott mentions phoning her to ask about completing the interview, to which she replied that \u201cWe should do it soon because I may change too much.\u201d Sontag sees nothing very unusual about this; it\u2019s simply good practice to move on from being the person you\u2019ve already established yourself as being:", "Intense seriousness, of course, always has a tendency to verge on the comic. Sontag was the Platonic ideal of the intellectual, and so she could also come across as a not-too-subtle parody of the very idea of such a person. At one point, she tells Cott that the first book that really thrilled her was a biography of Marie Curie by Curie\u2019s daughter Eve, which she recalls reading at age 6. The interviewer is impressed that a child of that age would go in for material of such relative heft. \u201cI started reading when I was 3,\u201d she expands, \u201cand the first novel that affected me was", "I cried and sobbed and wailed. When you\u2019re a reading child, you just read the books that are around the house. When I was about 13, it was Mann and Joyce and Eliot and Kafka and Gide\u2014mostly Europeans. I didn\u2019t discover American literature until much later.\u201d What to do with such a claim but both laugh at it and marvel at it? I thought of how my mother likes to remind me of my own alleged precocity by mentioning how she once came across me, age about 5, peering into a Jeffrey Archer blockbuster as though it contained the secret of life. By that age, Sontag would have been rolling up her sleeves and getting into Cervantes.", "But this long and largely genial portrait of the (not always quite so genial) intellectual in middle age also amounts to a strong and deeply personal argument about what it means to be cultured\u2014an argument for why a middle-aged intellectual might be something worth being in the first place. Part of what is so appealing about Sontag\u2019s thinking is the absence of any heavy intellectual machinery being brought to bear on whatever topic she happens to be considering; there is rarely very much in the way of dogma to be contended with. But there is a kind of personal dialectic at work in her attitude toward herself, toward her writing and reading and thinking and speaking. \u201cThe most awful thing,\u201d as she puts it in the book\u2019s final lines, \u201cwould be to feel that I\u2019d agree with the things I\u2019ve already said and written\u2014", "is what would make me most uncomfortable because that would mean that I had stopped thinking.\u201d", "---", "by Jonathan Cott.
