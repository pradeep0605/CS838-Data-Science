Domenica was only 4 or 5 at the time, but she recalls what happened next vividly: Kathi wielded a fireplace poker and, with all the torque her zaftig 5-foot frame could muster, brought it down on the windshield of Josie\u2019s car, an act of retribution for some slight now lost to family history.", "John Swansburg is", "'s deputy editor.", "\u201cMy mother\u2019s Italian-American family had a thuggish, moronic code of honor that everyone violated as often as they upheld it,\u201d Domenica Ruta writes at the outset of her powerful new memoir,", ". \u201cThis windshield job was an act of loyalty.
