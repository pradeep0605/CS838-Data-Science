J.D. Vance\u2019s memoir,", "about growing up poor in Appalachia, became the summer\u2019s surprise best-seller and deservedly so, but Nancy Isenberg\u2019s", "also made an appearance on the lists. Publishers often complain that presidential campaigns suck up all the media oxygen, making it nearly impossible to get the publicity needed to propel a new title to success, and perhaps they\u2019re right.

In 2017, with a concocter-in-chief who shows no sign of reining in his propensity for tweeting fabrications, novelists will have to continue to step up their game, and nonfiction writers will need to be more respectful of the truth than ever. As will the rest of us.", "", "Part 2 of Gottlieb\u2019s history of Western philosophy (following 2000\u2019s", ") has been a long time coming, but it\u2019s worth the wait. Rare are the works on this subject that can be described as sparkling, let alone entertaining, but Gottlieb\u2019s survey of the second great flourishing in Western thought (comprising Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Leibniz, and Hume, among others) is exactly the right blend of biography, historical context, precise but accessible descriptions of the philosophers\u2019 major concepts, and dish.", "", "In this searching recollection of his childhood in Appalachia and Rust Belt Ohio, Vance (a Marine Corps veteran and graduate of Yale Law School), describes the stubborn, proud, loyal, and often self-destructive culture that he both loves and was determined to escape. The child of an absent father and a combative, substance-abusing mother, Vance survived thanks to his ornery but devoted grandmother and heroically responsible sister. He trains an unflinching eye on the rural working class: its fatalism, its hypocrisy (\u201cI have known many welfare queens; some were my neighbors and all were white\u201d), and its anti-intellectual machismo. And that same unflinching eye observes the wrenching story of how a kid from that background struggled to adjust to the alien world of the Ivy League. Vance, a conservative, has been criticized for preaching a bootstraps-only remedy for the region\u2019s ills, but", "is short on policy recommendations of any kind. Rather, it\u2019s a requiem for an identity that sees no place for itself in a postindustrial world.", "In 2004, Faludi, one of the most celebrated feminist journalists of our time, learned that her estranged 76-year-old father had had sex reassignment surgery. This transformation prompted a reunion, but a highly perplexing one, as Faludi attempted to untangle the gordian knot of her father\u2019s identity, not just as a trans woman, but as a fashion photographer and retoucher, an abusive husband, a Hungarian, and a Jew who returned to the homeland where she had once lived as a hunted minority under the Nazi regime. The two argue about what it means to be a woman, to be Jewish, to be Hungarian, to be a parent, and to be a daughter, and each gives as good as she gets. Big-hearted and deeply researched, this memoir illustrates how deciding who we are is seldom as simple as we think.", "", "A research biologist specializing in plants, Jahren thinks of herself as a perennial misfit with literary leanings who has, against all odds, found a purchase in the world. She writes like an angel, and her memoir is a paean to such unlikely subjects as slide rules, grungy laboratories, and high-tech obstetric devices, as well as a bounty of floraphilia. But the true heart of the book is Jahren\u2019s relationship with Bill, her collaborator of 20 years, a (platonic) bond as unbreakable as it is unspoken, a union of oddballs who share a taste for junk food and sardonic asides. Oh, and for science. Rarely has the quest to know a little (or a lot) more about the world been rendered with more scruffy, exuberant beauty.", "", "Living abroad, writing for virtually no one until, in her 50s and with the help of Jonathan Franzen, she managed to publish her work for the first time, Zink has instantly become one of the most unusual, refreshing voices in contemporary fiction. Her work is completely unfettered by genteel literary conventions and replete with robust storytelling.

The premise for Smith\u2019s novel is familiar, but the result is inimitably her own.

Each book is narrated by a different detective: In this novel it\u2019s Antoinette Conway, a scrappy, mixed-race striver from a Dublin housing project acutely aware of how poorly she fits in with the rest of the squad. At first, she and her partner (one of the few colleagues she trusts) think they\u2019ve caught a garden-variety murder, and Antoinette sees no commonality between the well-groomed professional blond victim and herself. But unseen forces interfere with the investigation, forces whose motives may or may not align with Antoinette\u2019s suspicions about her tenuous status on the squad, leaving her unsure whether she can trust anyone, including herself.", "", "", "Spare, enigmatic and engrossing, Kang\u2019s parablelike tale of an ordinary middle-class housewife\u2019s decision to stop eating meat\u2014and the havoc this wreaks on her extended family\u2014resists easy interpretation. As with the films of David Lynch or Herman Melville\u2019s", "the mystery is all.
