{"Body": ["Nick Drnaso", "When you are a critic, you often find yourself listening to other people\u2019s opinions on how, ideally, a critic ought to ply her trade. It\u2019s wisest to keep a straight face and avoid explaining that the answer to this is often relative, depending on the platform. At the", ", for example, the critics are essayists first and foremost. If they brandish fierce prejudices or, as in the case of Anthony Lane, are sometimes willing to sacrifice information on the altar of witticism, so much the better: That\u2019s what", "critics do. Editorially, their performance takes precedence over the works they write about.", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "A film critic at the", ", on the other hand, is arguably the film critic of record for the nation and therefore has a lot less wiggle room. His reviews are expected to be a pleasure to read, accurate, fair, pertinent, informed, open-minded, authoritative, and addressed to the interests of a wide readership. Is there any space amid all those imperatives to breathe, let alone write? Apparently so, in the case of co-chief film critic A.O. Scott, and space enough to produce a book about it, as well\u2014one that embodies all of the aforementioned qualities, except, possibly, the last.", "is Scott\u2019s defense of his art, for art is what he declares criticism to be. I can already hear the howls of outrage at that claim. But as Scott (with whom, along with most of the other critics I\u2019ll mention here, I\u2019m friendly) points out, the two activities cannot be disentangled. \u201cCriticism is art\u2019s late-born twin,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey draw strength and identity from a single source, even if, like most siblings, their mutual dependency is frequently cloaked in rivalry and suspicion.\u201d Some of us may cling to the fantasy of the artist as a lone, Promethean genius on a mountaintop whose work speaks only to and for the ages, but most art is at least partly a response, like criticism, to other art. Artists measure their work against that of other artists, and critics (often reputed to care too much about the aesthetic horse race) also judge art by the standard of life. Art is not a monologue but a conversation\u2014and, as Scott himself likes to put it, \u201cthe essence of criticism is conversation.\u201d", "I\u2019d add that all art takes some ordinary human activity or diversion\u2014singing, dancing, telling stories, making things\u2014and concentrates it, converts it into something more meaningful, an end in itself. Criticism does this with the discussions we are always having about the art we make (and consume). As with most acts of human creation, you\u2019re less likely to do it well if you spend too much time thinking of it as", ". Self-importance is the enemy of significance, and no one can be more painfully aware of this paradox than a critic, which explains why", "is such a curiously flitting book. Scott begins with a bold assertion (\u201ccriticism, far from being a minor, petty, secondary art, is in fact larger than the others\u201d) and then dances back into self-deprecation and disclaimers. Recalling his youthful stabs at poetry and fiction, he blames his inability to write the sort of idea-driven work he aspired to on \u201cshallowness, maybe. Lack of nerve. Insufficient talent.\u201d", "The main form this self-critique takes in", "is a series of dialogues, in which Scott gets grilled by a skeptical version of himself. Sometimes the questioner pins his subject to the wall\u2014\u201cWhat are critics good for?\u201d; \u201cIt takes no effort at all to peg you, my friend, as a Gen-X baby in the throes of middle age, flailing between the Kubler-Ross stages of denial and acceptance as you mourn your lost youth\u201d \u2014and sometimes he expounds on one of Scott\u2019s points, explaining that \u201ca vital source of critical energy\u201d is the \u201cprecritical capacity for simple delight, the ability to be moved without thinking.\u201d", "This device, of course, furthers Scott\u2019s idea that criticism is a conversation, even when it\u2019s just a conversation with yourself, but it also manifests his central critical ethos, which is dialectical. Scott doesn\u2019t have a \u201cline,\u201d or at least not in the way that, say, James Wood, the", "\u2019s current literary critic and foremost champion of novelistic realism, does. Even when Scott writes an apparently forceful essay, such as", "published in the", "in 2014, the vector of his argument can be maddeningly hard to map. That\u2019s because Scott seems to believe that the ideal condition of a culture is to be in a state of churn or flux, in which the push in one direction\u2014toward, say, the idea that art ought to be relentlessly innovative\u2014meets robust challenge on behalf of the opposite\u2014toward, say, the celebration of fundamentals and tradition.", "This model leads Scott to his most striking observation, which is that not only are good critics often wrong but \u201cit is the sacred duty of the critic to be wrong.\u201d Let\u2019s say you argue, to take one classic example, that reprehensible themes and ideas can invalidate a technically masterful work of art. (The films of Leni Riefenstahl serve as the perfect example here.) This approach, while legitimate, is also inevitably reductive, because no one really wants to see art diminished to propaganda for correct ideas and behavior. A response\u2014for example, the \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d ethos of late 19", "-century English aestheticism\u2014will often rise up to assert that art is all about the execution, and morals be damned. This rhythm of call and response forms what Scott describes as \u201ca twisted, looping, stutter-stepping, incomplete path toward the truth.\u201d Both sides of the form vs. content debate are right, and both are wrong. A critic needs to take a side or we\u2019ll never get anywhere, but taking a side also means willfully stepping into error.", "Unless, I guess, you are A.O. Scott, and your side is that all sides are equally right, wrong, and essential. For what it\u2019s worth, I agree with him on this impossible and self-contradicting position, which, if we\u2019re honest, is par for the course in conversations about culture. Early in", "Scott\u2019s imaginary interlocutor asks if the book itself isn\u2019t just an elaborate bid \u201cto settle a score with Samuel L. Jackson.\u201d In the", ",", "(in which Jackson performed) as \u201ca snappy little dialogue comedy dressed up as something else, that something else being a giant A.T.M. for Marvel and its new studio overlords, the Walt Disney Company.\u201d Jackson objected on both Twitter and in an", ", complaining that there was no need to \u201cintellectualize\u201d the movie or to \u201csay something that\u2019s fucked-up about a piece of bullshit pop culture that really is good\u2014", "is a fucking great movie.\u201d", "Carmen Henning", "As Scott observes, there\u2019s a double standard at work here, one that professional critics of pop culture will find all too familiar. Jackson \u201cplaces", "simultaneously beneath criticism (\u2018a piece of bullshit pop culture\u2019) and beyond it (\u2018a fucking great movie\u2019).\u201d You can see a similarly muddled argument coming from fans of other, more stigmatized genres than action movies, whether their jam be romance novels or video games. They insist at once that outside arbiters of artistic merit should not automatically dismiss their favorite form, but they bristle when anyone applies", ". Gamers will bemoan that video games aren\u2019t recognized as a significant cultural form with a potential for greatness, then melt down when games are held to the standards that come with claims to cultural significance. \u201cGames are art,\u201d they say, but also, \u201clighten up, it\u2019s just a game.\u201d", "This maneuver should suggest to any observer that what lies at the heart of most popular beefs with critics isn\u2019t actually the stuff of the considered argumentation you\u2019ll find in", "Most considered thinkers don\u2019t take exception to criticism per se\u2014which is not surprising, given how closely considered thinking and good criticism are linked. Scott seems instead to be defending his profession against a more ad hoc volley of assaults, against the kinds of emails and social-media scoldings that prominent critics and their editors routinely get. Among the most common accusations: You\u2019re just jealous; What gives you the right?; You should make your own movie instead of going around slamming other people\u2019s life\u2019s work; You just didn\u2019t get it; How can you be so mean?; You\u2019re just a shill for big publishers/movie studios/record companies; You\u2019re a snob; What kind of vampiric job is yours, anyway? Any working critic with a reasonably decent readership has heard all of it many times, from both creators and fans.", "Unlike Scott, however, I can\u2019t receive any of these bogus provocations as sincere inquiries into the nature and purpose of criticism, for one simple reason: Such questions instantly evaporate the moment the reader agrees with the critic. If Scott had trumpeted", "as a masterpiece, Jackson would never have challenged his opinion. If you loved Bill Clegg\u2019s 2015 novel", "you might respond to Dwight Garner\u2019s", "on it in the", "by accusing the critic of pursuing a personal grudge. (I heard this exact charge from a couple of friends who, unsurprisingly, loved the novel.) But if you\u2019re, say, a dissenter from the general enthusiasm for Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s novel", "then you would greet a", "as the work of a fearless and welcome truth-teller. How the vast majority of people feel about critics is entirely dependent on how the critics make them feel about themselves and their own judgments.", "Furthermore, criticism needs no defending. It\u2019s a job because people (sometimes) pay you to do it, and many more people pay attention to it. Write whatever you want to me about the irrelevance and superfluity of critics when you\u2019re complaining that my top-10 list left off your favorite novel; you\u2019ve just proved you care enough about critics to gripe to and about one. People who really believe that \u201cjust a movie\u201d or \u201cjust a game\u201d requires no critical scrutiny would not be reading a review of one. People convinced that critics are out-of-touch snoots don\u2019t care about top-10 lists. This is not to say that there aren\u2019t some people who have no use for critics. There are, without a doubt. But people like that don\u2019t bother to dispute the critic\u2019s right to practice her art, and they don\u2019t, sadly, read books on the purpose and uses of criticism. They just look at you bemusedly after asking your profession at dinner parties and change the subject.
