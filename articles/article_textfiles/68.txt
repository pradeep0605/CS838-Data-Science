Classic housekeeping wisdom\u2014like the maxim that one should clean a room from top to bottom, to avoid soiling just-done surfaces\u2014is enthusiastically noted, and Kerr\u2019s acknowledgement that women are the greatest enemy to a clean bathroom, what with all the hair and \u201cdoggy-lookin\u2019 magazines everywhere,\u201d \u00a0is refreshingly honest and deeply true.
