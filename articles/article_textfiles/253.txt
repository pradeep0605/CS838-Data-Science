Emma Woodhouse, age 20, is, as the opening sentence famously proclaims, \u201chandsome, clever and rich,\u201d and if that weren\u2019t bad enough, she is also rather spoiled and a snob. But Emma is also witty and fundamentally kind, and more readers than Austen ever anticipated have been willing to give her the benefit of the doubt as she blunders and repents her way into a better character. The novel follows Emma\u2019s evolution, in about the course of a year, from a misguided girl to a woman of both sense and sensibility.", "The action takes place entirely in Highbury, a small town in Surrey. This setting provides what Austen described to her niece as \u201cthe delight of my life\u20142 or 3 families in a Country village is the very thing to work on.\u201d In more than any of her other novels, however, the town becomes a speaking presence, with its collective opinion often remarked upon: \u201cMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed.\u201d Stupid people sometimes complain that the limited, provincial settings of Austen\u2019s books and the entirely personal matters that concern them make her novels trivial or ephemeral. While there is not much point in debating with the stupid, it is worth noting that nothing is more eternal and universal to the human condition than the society of a small town. Adjust for variations in customs, possessions, and manners, and they\u2019re the same the world over, from China and Africa to rural Maine.", "In fact, the constrained scope of", "surely contributes to its perfection.

It\u2019s exquisitely ironic. That quality has somehow in recent years been confused with smirking insincerity; I could give you pages of examples of how Austen uses comic irony to the opposite effect, but here is just one. A Highbury couple of good manners but undistinguished origins has become prosperous and has begun to entertain some members of the upper crust.

It conveys that class relations in the backwater of Highbury are changing, but more importantly that Emma\u2019s resistance to that change, and her attachment to her advantage in status, will only make her lonely. Austen shows that her heroine\u2019s worst behavior and attitudes go against her better nature, which is convivial and loving. Soon, one of Austen\u2019s greatest comic creations will arrive in Highbury: Mrs. Elton (the new wife of the aforementioned vicar), who besides being deliciously awful, will further press this case by presenting Emma with a cautionary reflection of her own snobbery\u2014all while supplying Austen\u2019s readers with endless amusement.", "Comedy always imposes some distance. Austen is not obliged to take her heroine terribly seriously, and the perennial question of whom she will marry feels less than passionately urgent. If Elizabeth Bennet loses Mr. Darcy or Anne Elliot loses Captain Wentworth, the results will approach tragedy, but Emma will be fine, and knows it. \u201cI shall not be a poor old maid,\u201d she happily assures Harriet, \u201cand it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!\u201d Yet Austen does love Emma, who is surely the closest of all Austen\u2019s characters to her creator in temperament, wit, and imagination (if not in wealth). The presiding message of the novel is that we must forgive Emma for her shortcomings just as she can and does learn to excuse the sometimes vexing people around her. There is, I believe, more wisdom in that than in many, many more portentous and ambitious novels.
