My family background and education had been at least non- and in many respects anti-corporate. I often forgot to take my business card with me to lunch. It seemed silly.

Right now, the principal intermediaries between writers and readers continue to be publishing companies, large and small. They make their choices, pay more or less for them (usually less), more or less support them (usually less), hope that they have good bets and good luck in the casino that is publishing. In my judgment, there are between 20 and 30 editors and publishers in New York who\u2014along with experienced and discriminating publicists, marketers, and sales reps\u2014have over the decades regularly and successfully combined art and commerce and, in the process, have supported and promulgated art.
