Unlike Berg, however, all of them enlisted in the armed forces with the intent of producing films that would help sell the war to the American public. Four of them\u2014John Ford, William Wyler, George Stevens, and John Huston\u2014saw a significant amount of action, on the scene for some of the most important battles and events of WWII. And as all of them learned, and", "makes clear, being in the thick of war and depicting it as it\u2019s experienced are two very different, difficult things to do\u2014especially when the government gets involved.", "Harris carefully illustrates each director\u2019s reason for joining the cause. For Frank Capra, who served his time in Washington, D.C., overseeing the production of propaganda films, his Sicilian immigrant background made him eager to prove his patriotism. Wyler was an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Jew who saw the making of", "as \u201ca small contribution to the war effort.\u201d Stevens, who shot critical footage inside the Dachau concentration camp (used as evidence during the Nuremberg trials), was spurred to action after viewing Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s inflammatory Nazi propaganda film,", ". It was then that he had the epiphany, Harris writes, that \u201c'all film,' including his own, 'is propaganda.'\u201d", "", "It\u2019s these motivations, along with those of fellow filmmakers Ford and Huston, that lead the charge of Harris\u2019 narrative of Hollywood\u2019s complicated collaborative effort with the government during the war.

But by framing his study around five legendary directors, Harris provides a unique entry point into the two institutions\u2019 tempestuous relationship. Culled together and interlaced are stories of the directors\u2019 active participation in some of the war\u2019s most important battles, including the Battle of Midway (Ford) and the Normandy landings (Ford and Stevens). As the accounts of the directors\u2019 military experiences unfold and, at times, overlap with one another, Harris effectively places them in historical context via personal accounts, government documents, and newspaper clips.", "It\u2019s a structural device similarly employed by the author in his impressive debut", ", which looked at the five Best Picture nominees from 1967. In that book, Harris pinpointed a turning point in both cinematic and American tastes and compellingly told each film\u2019s long, troubled journey to Oscar night from social, political, and economic angles.", "harbors subject matter of an even grander variety, but the execution is no less detailed and fascinating to read. Through each of the five men\u2019s experiences, Harris unravels the difficulties of mixing Hollywood with politics.", "Most of the directors were already familiar with the pressures and confines of studio moguls; in 1938, Stevens was determined to make the anti-interventionist film Paths of Glory, but he was firmly denied by RKO and \u201cswiftly steered\u201d to make the gung-ho", ".

Harris\u2019 depiction of Mellett sets him up as an adversary fueled both by censorship (he frequently railed against films incorporating too many jingoistic elements) and competition. Mellett\u2019s fight over Capra\u2019s stereotypical depictions of the Axis Powers in the highly influential and propagandistic seven-part series", "is played out carefully and closely: the mediocre reception of Mellett\u2019s own theatrically released war documentary,", ",", "followed by General George Marshall\u2019s suggestion that", ", the first in Capra\u2019s series,", "needed to be seen by \u201cevery civilian\u201d; Mellet\u2019s angry note to Roosevelt that Capra\u2019s film, originally intended only for soldiers, is \u201ca bad picture in some respects, possibly even a dangerous picture.\u201d", "", "And Harris balances multiple storylines with ease: He offers deep analysis of the films created during this time, canny evaluation of the careers of the filmmakers themselves, and historical context of the public\u2019s constantly shifting feelings about the war.
