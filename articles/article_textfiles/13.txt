{"Body": ["Illustration by Ed Luce", "When does it first strike you, this feeling? When you\u2019re a kid, seeing the ocean weave through trees from the back seat of your parents\u2019 car? In high school, perched on warm bleachers and watching the sun flare bright against the tubas in the marching band? Or perhaps you\u2019re swimming in a backyard pool, squinting up at the black tarp of night above, and the feeling seeps into your ears along with the water. Later in life, it finds you in smaller moments. When you\u2019re spreading magazines in a neat spiral on a coffee table, or curling your fingers around the pleasantly rounded edges of a cellphone. Sometimes those big, chest-swelling moments come back: You\u2019re camping in the Blue Ridge Mountains, or driving to the dentist\u2019s office in slopping rain, or sitting on the shore with your toes in hot, wet sand\u2014and it\u2019s there once more.", "So what is that feeling? There isn\u2019t one single word for it\u2014that sudden inexplicable intensity of an encounter with something you find indisputably", ". It\u2019s a wondrous, complete sense of satisfaction. Of things falling into place. But if there isn\u2019t a word, could there be an explanation? A yearning for one drives the theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek\u2019s searching and earnest book", ".", "To Wilczek\u2014who received the Nobel Prize in 2004 for his work in particle physics\u2014the innate human appreciation for beauty lies in the \u201cdeep design\u201d of nature itself. In other words, we\u2019re infatuated with beauty because the universe was created to be beautiful. Wilczek\u2019s aim is grand, perhaps daringly so: He argues that beauty is the core organizational principle of every speck in the universe. The \u201cbeautiful question\u201d of the book is a simple one: \u201cIs the world a work of art?\u201d", "History books reveal that humans have always built their civilizations around two things: an obsessive desire for beauty and an analytical quest for truth. It\u2019s a classic tale\u2014the artist and the scientist, two halves of society. Wilczek tries to marry the two, arguing that they are one and the same: A search for the scientific", "a hunger for the beautiful. Beauty is order, and order is beauty. His argument isn\u2019t spiritual, but based on fact\u2014as an agnostic, the author steers well clear of religion, and the result is a bracing meditation that leans convincingly on hard science.", "All forces of nature, from electromagnetism to gravity, \u201cembody, at their heart, a common principle: local symmetry,\u201d Wilczek writes. It\u2019s this symmetry that calls to us. When we declare a certain color combination aesthetically pleasing, what we\u2019re really admiring is its perfect order. Our love of lakes and rivers is a way of paying homage to the timely organization of waves, to the synchronized dance of wind and air.", "Photo by Andrei Linde", "This isn\u2019t an easy idea to buy into, at first, and Wilczek\u2019s unabashed geekiness doesn\u2019t always help. Each chapter of", "grapples with a different philosophical or scientific field, jumping erratically from number theory to platonic solids to sound waves. The book\u2019s 448 pages include a timeline, index, and dictionary of scientific terms, leading it to feel, at times, like a physics textbook disguised as an artistic reflection. That the book is so technical shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, though; Wilczek\u2019s previously published works all deal with intricate physics theories, and most are not made for the lay reader. \u00a0Given all this, the book should be overwhelming to read\u2014or even unpleasant.", "But it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s because all 448 pages are buoyed by a singular, fervent enthusiasm. This is the book of a love-struck physicist\u2014one who leaps, within the span of a page, from providing a dense explanation of photons to delightedly comparing atoms to \u201ctiny musical instruments.\u201d The word", "\u2014as in, the beautiful question driving everything\u2014is endearingly capitalized every time, as if Wilczek frets that the reader might forget its importance. And sustained above all the science lessons is the clear note of the book\u2019s unremitting love of the universe.", "If we\u2019re instinctively obsessed with beauty because it\u2019s orderly, then this book\u2014a book that organizes beauty into order\u2014tugs at that very instinct in order to foster our understanding. At every turn, Wilczek cleverly reels the science of beauty back to basic organizational principles, whether visual or abstract. Astronomy is shown to operate within simple rules of geometry. Music is deconstructed into its primary form, auditory harmony. The same principles of symmetry and economy, which Wilczek calls the \u201challmarks of nature\u2019s artistic style,\u201d make their way into Newton\u2019s method of reductionism and James Clerk Maxwell\u2019s theory of electrodynamics. Even if we can\u2019t fully understand the laws of nature themselves, Wilczek lets us appreciate how they are mirrored and embedded within one another, catering once again to our deep, universally programmed need for organization.", "Of course, the subject that Wilczek explores is by no means a new one. Phi, the golden ratio that seems to govern the proportions of everything from seashell spirals to man-made financial markets, has captivated mathematicians for more than 2,000 years, as just one of the many puzzlingly organized aspects of the natural world that scholars have explored. For this reason, Wilczek could have easily titled his book not", "but", "the one that has consumed humans for all of history, the one that may well be unanswerable. To Wilczek\u2019s first-page question (\u201cIs the world a work of art?\u201d), his response is a resounding yes. But while Wilczek mulls over the larger question that answer demands\u2014", "does this artful arrangement of a universe exist?\u2014he does not actually\u00a0answer it.", "is a meditation, not a solution. Reaching the end of the book offers the same rush of satisfaction, of comfort, that you\u2019d get from cleaning out a messy closet, or assembling a piece of furniture\u2014but on an immense, cosmic scale, accompanied by a strange and buoyant joy. You feel as though you are in high school again, and you are on the bleachers of a football field once more, watching the sun strike across the grass just so. This time, you better understand the way the feeling resonates all the way down to your bones.", "\u2014", "by Frank Wilczek. Penguin.", "", "Amy X.
