{"Body": ["Sigrid Estrada", "I recently tried to summarize Susan Faludi\u2019s impressive new memoir,", "for a friend, just as I\u2019m about to summarize it for you. \u201cIt sounds like a novel,\u201d she replied. \u201cA bad novel.\u201d It does. Sometimes, reality delivers up not just a remarkable story, but a remarkable story containing a set of parallel motifs that seem too absurdly perfect to be credible. If you read this stuff in a work of fiction, you\u2019d smack the book closed and grumble, \u201cEnough, already!\u201d", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "Here\u2019s what happened to Faludi, the author of", "and one of the most influential feminist journalists of her generation. In the summer of 2004, she received an email from her 76-year-old father. This in itself was worth noting as the two had barely spoken in decades: Faludi\u2019s mother had filed for divorce when Susan was 16; her father had responded with what Faludi describes as \u201ca season of escalating violence.\u201d One night, in violation of a restraining order, he broke down the door of their suburban home and stormed in with a baseball bat, attacking the man his wife had just begun dating. He stabbed his rival multiple times with a Swiss Army knife, spattering the house with blood and putting the other man in the hospital. Later, he managed to convince a judge that he was the wronged party and got his child support payments reduced to $50 per week.", "During the intervening quarter century, Faludi\u2019s father moved back to his homeland of Hungary. Although not definitively estranged, father and daughter exchanged little more than a few emails over those years. The message that arrived in Susan\u2019s inbox in 2004 changed all that. \u201cI have decided that I have had enough of impersonating a macho aggressive man that I have never been inside,\u201d it read. Susan\u2019s father had recently returned from a trip to Thailand, where she had received sex reassignment surgery. The email was short on words but rich in photographs of Susan\u2019s transformed parent, Stef\u00e1nie Faludi.", "A couple of months later, Susan hopped a plane to Budapest and began a long, tortured collaboration with her father that has finally resulted in", "(Stef\u00e1nie died in 2015.) Faludi describes the process as \u201ca game of cat and mouse, a game the mouse generally won.\u201d Stef\u00e1nie wants Susan to tell her story, but like most people, she wants it told", "way. Susan Faludi is a formidable reporter, an old hand at beguiling secrets out of sources and digging up incriminating facts. Among other things,", "conclusively debunked a ballyhooed Harvard-Yale study claiming that single, college-educated women over 40 had a better chance of being killed in a terrorist attack than of getting married. But this time, the self-described \u201cgirl reporter\u201d meets her match. She tries to get her father to talk about her experiences as a once-rich Jewish boy reduced to living on the streets of Budapest during World War II. That overture gets shut down with a dismissive wave of Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s hand. Susan drags Stef\u00e1nie to the Hungarian Jewish Museum, where her ultra-patriotic father glances at a display of virulently anti-Semitic Hungarian propaganda and sniffs, \u201cThis is of no interest.\u201d", "You can\u2019t make this stuff up! Or rather, you can, but no one would believe it.", "Susan Faludi believes her father\u2019s late-life transformation bore some relation to a lifelong affinity for disguises, reinvention, and forgery. \u201cMy father\u2019s abiding self,\u201d she writes, \u201cremained very much resistant and elusive, especially and reliably when it came to matters of history, personal or public.\u201d During the war, as family legend had it, Stef\u00e1nie (then Istv\u00e1n Friedman) freed his parents from a perilous situation by wearing a pilfered armband and posing as a member of the Hungarian fascist party. Living by his wits and working for the resistance, he regularly evaded a regime that was among the most zealous perpetrators of the Holocaust. He dressed as a mechanic and carried fake identity papers, but the most persuasive mask is an internal one. \u201cNo one sees me as a Jew,\u201d Stef\u00e1nie boasts to her daughter of her ability to carry off such dissembling, \u201cbecause", "don\u2019t see me as a Jew.\u201d", "Emigrating to America, Istv\u00e1n changed his name to Steven Faludi, married Susan\u2019s mother, and assumed the highly conventional role of a midcentury American husband, father, and breadwinner. In the years before digital photography and Photoshop, he worked as one of the pre-eminent retouchers, a darkroom wizard who perfected glamorous images for Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines like", "and", ", fine-tuning the work of such masters as Richard Avedon, Francesco Scavullo, Irving Penn, and Bert Stern. He was, Susan writes, \u201cparticularly skilled at \u2018dodging,\u2019 making dark areas look light, and \u2018masking,\u2019 concealing unwanted parts of the picture.\u201d[34] You can\u2019t make this stuff up! Or rather, you can, but no one would believe it. To top it off, Hungarian, Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s native tongue, just happens to be a language without gendered pronouns; \u201cHungarians,\u201d Faludi writes, \u201care notorious for mixing up the sexes in English.\u201d", "During Susan\u2019s childhood, Steven Faludi forcefully asserted his \u201cmale prerogative,\u201d[7] forbidding his wife to work and devoting his weekends to projects in his basement workshop. Susan writes that although she never suspected her father of being at odds with his apparent gender, she sensed he was not entirely present: \u201cI sometimes regarded him as a spy, intent on blending into our domestic circle, prepared to do whatever it took to evade detection. For all his aggressive domination, he remained somehow invisible.\u201d Later, once Susan begins visiting Stef\u00e1nie, she is more willing to talk about herself, but only within limits. Like Steven, Stef\u00e1nie lectures endlessly about topics Susan regards as superficial\u2014opera, mountaineering, \u201cher favorite hagiographies of Hungarian martyrs,\u201d resource and beauty websites for trans women, retouched photos of herself in pinup outfits, and above all, two Budapest buildings owned by her family before the war, property she\u2019d tried to reclaim for decades in vain.", "Most of", "and the best of it, consists of the epic battle, and eventually the epic rapprochement, between Susan and Stef\u00e1nie\u2014an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. On Susan\u2019s first visit, Stef\u00e1nie doesn\u2019t want to leave her house, perched on a hill overlooking a lost Friedman family manse. Susan begs to be taken on a tour of the places her father lived in and knew as a boy, prompting Stef\u00e1nie to scold, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay to live in the past,\u201d and lose her temper spectacularly when Susan persists. Meanwhile, Stef\u00e1nie keeps trying to show Susan things she doesn\u2019t want to see, asking her daughter to leave her bedroom door open at night \u201cbecause I want to be treated as a woman. I want to be able to walk around without clothes and for you to treat it normally.\u201d To which Susan retorts, \u201cWomen don\u2019t \u2018normally\u2019 walk around naked.\u201d", "Eventually, Stef\u00e1nie grows out of this exhibitionism but her idea of what ordinary life consists of for most women remains absurdly skewed. \u201cMen", "to help me,\u201d she tells Susan. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great advantages to being a woman. You write about the disadvantages of being a woman, but I\u2019ve", "found advantages!\u201d Susan doesn\u2019t appear to have much trouble adjusting to the news about Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s gender but balks at what she views as a retrograde, \u201cbinary\u201d conception of gender advanced by her father.", "Susan thinks to herself during one particularly vexing exchange, \u201cyou\u2019re still the same person.\u201d She traces this attitude among some trans individuals back to a physician, Harry Benjamin, known as \u201cthe father of transsexualism\u201d for his pioneering surgical work in the 1950s and", "published in 1966. Benjamin founded a set of protocols dictating that any male-to-female patient hoping to qualify for surgery must, as Susan puts it, \u201cembody all the clich\u00e9s of postwar femininity,\u201d the same oppressive standards feminists like Susan would resolve to overturn.", "But what most interests Susan is the larger, ever-shifting puzzle of her father\u2019s identity. As she digs deeper, unearthing Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s past one crumb at a time, Hungary veers toward an increasingly bigoted authoritarianism disturbingly reminiscent of the years leading up to World War II. Susan\u2019s father, when she isn\u2019t shrugging off the rise of right-wing Hungarian nationalism, pines for the cosmopolitan days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when the country\u2019s Jews enjoyed what felt like an extraordinary degree of acceptance and integration. Hungary lost both territory and ethnic diversity in the treaty that followed World War I, and the disaffected majority turned on the Jewish minority (as well as the Roma), blaming them for everything that had gone wrong. In the newly mutilated Hungary, one could either be Magyar (ethnic Hungarian), or one could be a Jew and therefore decidedly", "Hungarian. That\u2019s \u201cone way to read the collapse of the Golden Age,\u201d Susan writes: \u201cit\u2019s what happens when a fluid system becomes binary.\u201d", "By the time Susan visits her back in Hungary, Stef\u00e1nie has once more embraced the most sentimental version of Hungarian identity and glossed over the enthusiasm with which the Magyars had participated in Hitler\u2019s Final Solution. (Adolf Eichmann singled them out for commendation on this point.) The anti-Semitic propaganda used to justify that genocide often characterized Jewish men as degenerate, weak, and feminized. When Stef\u00e1nie complains to Susan about the rabbis who refused to order Susan\u2019s mother to abandon divorce proceedings, she repeats their demurrals in a high-pitched \u201cmincing\u201d voice. \u201cHere,\u201d Susan thinks, reeling, \u201cwas a Jewish man-turned-woman making fun of Jewish men for not being manly enough.\u201d At the same time, as impossible as her father is, Susan comes to recognize and feel compassion for the bewildering and titanic forces, inside and out, that batter Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s psyche.", "Susan never truly can sort out her father\u2019s slippery identity. Given her skepticism about the notion of any fixed identity\u2014the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of contemporary American life, as she puts it\u2014this makes for a happy ending to a book whose complexity fascinates. The two women reach an understanding of sorts when they discover that a Reform synagogue (the first one in Hungary) has set up shop in an apartment building once owned by Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s father. In another of those coincidences that would be laughable in a novel, it turns out that the synagogue occupies the very same flat where Istv\u00e1n and his father had hidden from the Nazis during the summer of 1944. Father and daughter celebrate Rosh Hashanah with this community, one that welcomes sexual minorities and whose members include many novices, people who learned of their Jewish heritage only after the fall of the Soviet Union from parents who had, until then, deemed it safer to keep that fact to themselves. \u201cI always felt there was something different about me,\u201d one of them, a woman, tells Susan, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d And who ever really does?", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
