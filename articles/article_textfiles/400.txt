Leaving aside the obviously problematic use of \u201cAfrican\u201d as a catch-all classification for literature from 1 billion people in 52 countries (and a decidedly Eurocentric bias), my classmate\u2019s musings did identify a tension at the very root of the Western world\u2019s interaction with so-called African literature. Can literature be both overtly political and also great?", "It seems an absurd question when considering many prominent works of the English canon. What is", "if not a commentary on the life cycles of autocrats? What is", "if not an extended criticism of class distinction in 19", "-century Britain? And yet, with writings by African authors the question persists: Is it high art delivering timeless and universal commentary on the human condition, or is it little more than a guide to the culture and politics of a specific continent (with occasional literary flourishes)? The question will not die because of the Western tendency to view life in Africa as so profoundly alien that nearly everything written from the continent becomes not literature, but a manual\u2014and we all know how we feel about manuals.", "The first wave of interest in African writers hit the global literary scene around the same time many countries won independence from oppressive colonial regimes. Beginning in the 1960s, writing from the continent was parsed so thoroughly for political meanings that a sentence was always more than a simple sentence: It was commentary on race, culture, or the politics of colonialism and independence. The stunning craft and beauty of writing by Achebe, Wole Soyinka, and", ", for example, was often overlooked; criticism of their work focused in large part on how new Africa presented itself to its former masters\u2014rather than how great writers from a portion of the world presented their many and varied takes on the existential questions that torment us all. African writing was labeled", "because Western interest in Africa was, primarily, political.", "A generation later, a second wave of interest in African writing arose as the world became reacquainted with Africa as a realm of human suffering\u2014a continent that needed to be saved from itself by the same people who had so thoroughly exploited and rubbished it. Again it seems much of the writing by African authors of the aughts\u00a0 (including my own) was seen as illuminating a very particular form of", "misfortune (war, disease, corruption) and not issues that were globally generalizable. In other words, to reinterpret my long-ago classmate\u2019s comment, African literature will never be great in the Western mind not because it is political, but because it is African\u2014and African is too particularly", "to be universal.", "The Ghanian poet and educator Kojo Laing released his debut novel", ", newly reprinted by McSweeney\u2019s, in 1986\u2014directly between those two eras of international visibility for African writing, a time when once-prestigious universities across the continent fell into disrepair, victims of despots and broken economies. Born in Kumasi, a city well inland from Ghana\u2019s coastal capital Accra, Laing was educated in the U.K., earning a master\u2019s in political science and history at Glasgow before returning to a Ghana completely transformed from a hopeful place post-independence to an economic and political basket case ruled by increasingly aggressive and paranoid military regimes. Gone were the pseudodemocratic Pan-African rhetorical escapades of Kwame Nkrumah, replaced by the numbing military speak (\u201c", ",\u201d \u201cOperation Feed Yourself\u201d) of the generals who overthrew the civilian regime and then each other through the 1970s. It\u2019s those strongmen, particularly Ignatius Acheampong and his successor Fred Akuffo, who most concern", ", a book that for years has confounded those who try to summarize and categorize it. As the Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina writes in his insightful introduction to the rerelease:", "When", "was first published it created a lot of critical attention\u2014and confusion. Is it magic realism? No. A satire? No. Panicked critics, constrained by newspaper word counts, by epistemological confusion, by the usual third world head fogs, searched for catchphrases with which to hitch this unruly wagon to a recognizable star.", "The closest thing to a plot in this book is the thin thread of happenings after a botched horse-smuggling operation creates a scene at Accra\u2019s international airport. Aside from this, the many, many main characters \u2014the loud and pestering madman Beni Baidoo, the brooding wanderer Kofi Loww, his lover Adwoa Adde, the cantankerous Professor Sackey, his nemesis the scheming academic Dr. Boadi, to name just a few\u2014are free to come and go as they please, telling their stories in a nonchronological fashion, offering bits of wisdom and patent absurdities up to the last page when we wonder, out of confusion and because of our enjoyment, why they stopped. Like Samuel Beckett, Laing utilizes narrative confusion to help construct the book\u2019s environment and emotional tone at any given moment. And as we do with Beckett, we continue reading Laing in spite of our confusion and frustration because of the beauty of his prose. His sentences can only be described as heated, bubbling over with images, slamming metaphor and simile against quiet and simple observation, sometimes purposefully confusing meanings in the most poetic fashion: \u201cThe workers stole me right and left, and it wasn\u2019t right that they left me so stolen.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s the poet in Laing that privileges wordplay over exposition to create both textual wonder and a sense of wondering exactly what we are wondering about.", "But however confusing the multiple characters, plots, and even languages of", ", the book zeroes in on what my former classmate might call a particularly African literary shortcoming: politics. Specifically, the politics of identity\u2014or more accurately the search for it\u2014in a world no longer defined by the oppositional forces of the independence era. It is a search that takes place on multiple levels\u2014personal, national, and even international\u2014and in multiple realms: the bedroom, the compound, the farm, the market, the church and streets, in short all the spaces that comprise Laing\u2019s thoroughly and poetically rendered Accra.", "\u201cI only want a little authenticity!\u201d shouts Osofo, a Christian priest yet also a practitioner of traditional healing.

Laing\u2019s characters are most terrified of stasis and complacency: \u201cThe body of the Ghanian was too heavy, too crowded, and too comfortable: it carried all the symbols, it carried the universe so easily; and in this way, it felt so much less responsibility, so much less adventure for all the external world beyond itself.\u201d Those we might consider this book\u2019s heroes seek constant motion and change as opposed to those, like the notorious Dr. Boadi, who seek material comfort. There is no issue in this book, no issue in the Ghana of the time period", "chronicles that is not pulled into Laing\u2019s vortex of language about the search for an authentic identity.

Characters appear and disappear. Storylines begin. We are not sure where they end or if they end at all. And at times meaning is lost in a linguistic effusiveness, a poet\u2019s ornamentation, that overshadows the novel\u2019s various happenings. Were Laing not so brilliant in his manipulation of the English language, this might be a greater problem, but thankfully he is a master stylist, and", "delivers an absorbing, if demanding, world for both its characters and the reader.", "The McSweeney\u2019s rerelease is itself a physically beautiful book, and it comes at a time when an increased focus on writers from Africa ought to bring Laing more of the recognition that his work briefly received in 1986. The timing of the release also comes as Ghana\u2014and indeed most of the continent\u2014searches for yet another new identity\u2014post-Africa as pity party, prepotential economic explosion (or exploitation, depending on where you stand). Politically Ghana is far from the revolving dictatorships of the 1970s, but it faces new challenges: Managing newly discovered oil wealth and translating the dividends of democracy into development for all of its citizens.", "Twenty-six years after its first publication,", "feels fiercely relevant to all individuals and societies grappling with who they are in relation to the wider world.
