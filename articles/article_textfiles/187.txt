{"Body": ["Panels from \"The Nest\" by Ethan Rilly.", "Since 2009, when he published the first issue of his recurring comics series", ", the Canadian cartoonist", "has attracted fans. Like, big-deal fans, at least in the odd and rarefied world of art comics, with praise coming his way from cartoonists like Seth and Adrian Tomine. He\u2019s won an Ignatz award and a Doug Wright Award, and he\u2019s the kind of creator whose books other creators wait for eagerly. Reading the comics, it\u2019s easy to see why: Rilly\u2019s cartooning seems effortlessly evocative, each panel detailed and crisp but never stiff\u2014there\u2019s a real sense of actual life zipping by within each contained space. He seems like a cartoonist, as Tomine half-complimented, half-complained, \u201cwho just seems to know how to draw everything.\u201d", "But the latest issue,", ", demonstrates that Rilly is also developing into a unique and clever storyteller. In this issue Rilly sets aside the continuing tale that has occupied the first three issues\u2014gone, for the moment, are aspiring actress Vickie and her law-clerk roommate Frances\u2014and instead publishes a series of elliptical, heart-rending short stories, set both on worlds faraway and unfamiliar and in towns recognizably our own. In the story that got me the hardest, \u201cThe Nest,\u201d a middle-aged father and mother struggle to help a daughter struggling with what appears to be schizophrenia. Like all Rilly stories, it\u2019s understated where other writers might have been grand; it\u2019s psychologically acute, and attuned to the weird and intimidating magic of everyday life; and it\u2019s drawn so beautifully that many simple panels made me gasp. It\u2019s another exceptional work from one of our finest cartoonists, and I can\u2019t wait to see what Rilly does next.
