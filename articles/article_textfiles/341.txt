{"Body": ["Photograph by Steve Rhodes/Wikiquotes.", "In a 2004", "", ", David Foster Wallace invoked what he called a \u201cparadox about literary biographies.\u201d Most people interested enough in a writer\u2019s life to read a whole book about it were, he argued, likely to be admirers of that writer\u2019s work, and were therefore inclined to idealize him or her as a person. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit often seems that the person we encounter in the literary biography could not possibly have written the works we admire. And the more intimate and thorough the bio, the stronger this feeling usually is.\u201d The Borges that Wallace encountered in Williamson\u2019s book (\u201ca vain, timid, pompous mama's boy, given for much of his life to dithery romantic obsessions\u201d) didn\u2019t seem to have a whole lot in common with the genius who wrote the stories in", "and", ".", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", ", D.T. Max\u2019s biography of Wallace, doesn\u2019t elicit quite as stark a sense of paradox, or as thorough a disillusionment. The things we learn about DFW the Guy tend to correspond to what we already knew about DFW the Writer. What\u2019s surprising, though, is how often those correspondences take forms we mightn\u2019t have expected. Wallace was preoccupied with the ungainly, unfashionable questions of how to live and of how to be moral, and he believed that fiction had to try to provide answers to those questions. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that he himself was often guilty of exactly the kind of (specifically male) moral failures he focused on in, say,", ".", "But it\u2019s still something of a shock to see the extent to which Wallace\u2014the perspiring, softly spoken and tortuously sincere figure of popular affection\u2014could himself be a Hideous Man. Sure, his friend Jonathan Franzen", "that Wallace was never \u201cSaint Dave,\u201d but it\u2019s another thing entirely to see him walking through the Amherst campus as an undergraduate, remarking on the springtime \u201csmell of cunt in the air.\u201d We later learn that Orin Incandenza\u2019s penchant, in", "for seducing young mothers is in fact something he shared with his creator. We learn about DFW\u2019s womanizing, about his book-tour fondness for \u201caudience pussy,\u201d and that he once wondered aloud to Franzen about whether his only purpose in life was \u201cto put my penis in as many vaginas as possible.\u201d", "It might at first seem difficult to reconcile this guy with the writer who", "for their priapic self-absorption, but what\u2019s at issue here isn\u2019t hypocrisy so much as a kind of outward-directed self-reproof that was crucial to Wallace\u2019s writing. A lot of what he disliked in other people, and much of what concerned him about contemporary culture (polymorphous addiction, shallow self-obsession, ostentatious cleverness, reflexive irony) was a reflection of something that discomfited him in himself. Unlike Updike, Wallace refused to make an artistic virtue out of the necessary evil of his own narcissism; he wanted, in his life and his art, to be a great deal better than he often was. (As a teacher he was hard on clever students who reminded him, either in their work or their personalities, of his younger self.)", "One of the most compelling aspects of", "is the drama of this ongoing struggle between the ideal and actual selves. \u201cIn general,\u201d as Max puts it in a section on Wallace\u2019s first sojourn at the Yaddo artists retreat, \u201che gyrated between wanting to impress and disliking himself for having such impulses, between making his mark as the genius in the room and getting his work done.\u201d He badly wanted fame and success, which he of course got, but what he wanted even more was to be the type of writer for whom these things didn\u2019t matter. This he never quite managed to achieve.", "Max quotes a letter Wallace wrote to", "author Elizabeth Wurtzel, with whom he was briefly involved. The letter captures a raw form of the kind of exponential moral self-scrutiny that is now so associated with Wallace, and which could often make him seem like the hypertrophic offspring of Derrida and St. Augustine:", "I go through a loop in which I notice all the ways I am\u2014for just an example\u2014self-centered and careerist and not true to standards and values that transcend my own petty interests, and feel like I\u2019m not one of the good ones; but then I countenance the fact that here at least here I am worrying about it, noticing all the ways I fall short of integrity, and I imagine that maybe people without any integrity at all don\u2019t notice or worry about it [...] but this soon becomes a vehicle for feeling superior to (imagined) Others.", "In that Borges piece, Wallace also identified a problem he saw as being more or less built into the genre of literary biography: that \u201cthe personal lives of people who spend 14 hours a day sitting there alone, reading and writing, are not going to be thrill rides to hear about.\u201d That may be true in general (it\u2019s certainly true of the Borges biography, which is, I can confirm, no", "), but it\u2019s not true of Wallace\u2019s life, and it\u2019s not true of this book. \u201cThrill ride\u201d wouldn\u2019t be quite the right term for what is one of the saddest books I\u2019ve ever read, but I\u2019m having trouble remembering when I was last so consumed by any piece of writing, fiction or non.", "A lot of this, of course, has to do with a sort of semipuerile curiosity value. (And there\u2019s a curious reflection here of the quintessentially Wallace-esque phenomenon of self-loathing as a specific result of self-infatuation; reading about this stuff is utterly compelling, but you kind of hate yourself for being so compelled by it.) The extensive, substance-soaked wreckage of Wallace\u2019s romantic life is, for one thing, detailed in horribly fascinating detail. Often, this is done in ways that illuminate Wallace\u2019s work, or at least the background to it. (The real-life model for the protagonist of Wallace\u2019s excruciatingly brilliant short story \u201cThe Depressed Person,\u201d Max tells us, was Wurtzel.) More often, though, it\u2019s just plain gruesome\u2014and nowhere more than in Max\u2019s detailing of Wallace\u2019s relationship with the poet and novelist Mary Karr, who was married with a teenage son when he met her through a recovery program. He turns up at a pool party Karr is attending with her family, a bandage on his shoulder covering a fresh tattoo of her name. He contacts an ex-con fellow AA member looking to buy a gun to shoot Karr\u2019s husband. He tries to push her from a moving car. During another fight, he throws\u2014literally throws\u2014a coffee table at her.", "Photograph by \u00a9Flash Rosenberg.", "Max expertly handles all these aspects of Wallace\u2019s damaged life, and the unsensational, just-the-facts approach serves the material well. But he\u2019s also very good on the editing process, and on Wallace\u2019s relationships with Gerry Howard at Viking Penguin and Michael Pietsch at Little, Brown (who told Wallace\u2019s agent that he wanted to publish", "\u201cmore than I want to breathe\u201d). You wouldn\u2019t expect the war of editorial attrition over a 1,200-page, footnote-encrusted novel to make for especially gripping reading, but it does. Max\u2019s detailing of the push and pull between Wallace and Pietsch highlights, above all, the contingency of the published text, the extent to which it is a result of countless reinings-in, relinquishments and grudging compromises. His reading of the fiction itself is thoughtful and subtle; although it\u2019s never groundbreaking, it\u2019s never perfunctory either. Max also doesn\u2019t overstretch himself, as literary biographers often do, in pointing out correspondences between the life and the art.", "Max\u2019s focus is, not surprisingly, more or less resolutely on Wallace\u2019s life as it related to his art. This decision to strip the story down to its narrative essentials pays off in terms of compulsive readability, but there are places where you wish he\u2019d peeled away a little less. The problem is most acute when it comes to Wallace\u2019s mother Sally, a professor of English and grammar specialist. Max refers to the story \u201cSuicide as a Sort of Present\u201d as \u201ca meditation on [Wallace\u2019s] difficult relationship with his mother,\u201d but the nature of this difficulty remains largely undefined, and Sally is never more than a hazily peripheral figure. (This may well have to do with the fact that Max is writing here about a person whose family are all still alive.", "on the annotations in Wallace\u2019s collection of self-help and psychology books is more revealing on this topic.)", "And yet it wouldn\u2019t be fair to say that the book sacrifices characterization to plot, because, where it counts for most, Max certainly pulls it off. Wallace himself emerges as such a complex, poignant figure\u2014is so thoroughly brought to life in all his affliction and ambition and dangerousness and decency\u2014that, in the closing pages of the book, I felt, as though for the first time, the terrible magnitude of his loss. And though much of it is already familiar from", "about the author\u2019s final depression and suicide, what happens in those pages still comes as a strangely abrupt bereavement. I knew what was coming, of course (how could I not?), but knowing what\u2019s coming turns out not to be the same thing as being ready for it.", "It was primarily the details that I found myself unready for. Like how he\u2019d previously prepared to kill himself by tying a garden hose to his car\u2019s exhaust pipe with his bandana (which would have been like Freud somehow committing suicide with his glasses, or Joyce with his walking stick). Or how, during the terrible days of his final illness, his parents moved in with him: \u201cSally Wallace cooked him the meals he had loved as a child\u2014casseroles and pot pies; they watched", ". It was obvious to his family that he was in unendurable pain. Before she left, he thanked her for being his mother.\u201d There may well be readers who can get through sentences like these without having to put down the book and take a few deep breaths, but I\u2019m certainly not one of them.", "Part of this emotional force is due to the relative recentness of Wallace\u2019s death, to the not-yet-fully-dissipated haze of unreality that surrounds the fact of his 2008 suicide. But it also has to do with the way in which a book like this, which reveals for the first time many of the facts of a life of such serious cultural consequence, serves as a kind of public completion of that death, as a final rite in the literary funeral. There is, in other words, a slightly paradoxical effect to", ". In providing a more complete sense of Wallace than we ever had while he lived, it makes his death feel more real, somehow more irrefutable. And, for anyone who felt a profound emotional connection to Wallace and his work, there\u2019s a strenuously cathartic dimension to this: the experience of knowing him more fully, and of thereby feeling more completely the force and finality of his absence.", "---", "by D.T.
