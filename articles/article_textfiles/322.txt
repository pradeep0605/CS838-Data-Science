{"Body": ["Photos by Michael Lionstar", ",", "Our relationship has had a magical quality for me right from the beginning. We met one night at a dinner given by the author", "shortly after you and your wife Elsa had returned from Botswana where you were Peace Corps Country Directors for five years. The evening was fun and funny, and exciting in some indefinable way. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard your side of that night.", "Yes, that was a vivid evening for me, too. I was full of stories about Africa. Overflowing, you might say. And an odd phenomenon was that both Elsa and I were finding that no one asked about our experiences of the last five years. At least not beyond the basics, along the lines of, \u201cAre you glad you went?\u201d I think that what was fascinating to me was understandably categorized by others as something like vacation snapshots I had in my wallet.", "At that point, you had had a couple of the stories that would later be collected in", "published in", ", which I learned during the evening. I had a pile of old", "s in my apartment, so I went through them when I got home and found \u201cBruns,\u201d which opens the collection. I thought it was a perfect story, so perfect that I read it again. Still perfect. I got up early the next morning, read it once more, and felt the same, so I immediately called your agent Andrew Wylie, who sent me two more stories and an outline of a novel, which turned out to be", ", and we signed you up.", "I was in Gaborone when I got a letter from Andrew proposing to represent me. It was exciting. He\u2019d seen a story in", ". Speaking of writer/agent relationships, I\u2019d had an agent before Andrew. She\u2019d handled a novel, a weird political bildungsroman that she\u2019d undoubtedly sent to every possible publishing house, but, fortunately (I think now) she\u2019d failed to find a taker. We hadn\u2019t been in touch since that failure, but I was still under the impression I had an agent, so thought that as a courtesy I\u2019d let her know that our working relationship was officially over. I knew she\u2019d have no reason to mind, but was surprised at the brevity of the reply that came on her letterhead: \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had a relationship.\u201d", "As I discovered when working on the full", "manuscript, you didn\u2019t need very much editing. Your sentences are so inimitably yours, they\u2019re not easy to edit, except to note repetitions, or to point out that something\u2019s hard to get. I do remember having an argument with you over the ending of \u201cOfficial Americans,\u201d because I thought it wasn\u2019t clear enough. You won, of course, but you did tell me later that you\u2019d gotten a couple of letters asking for clarification when it came out in", ". I remember gloating a little over those letters.", "As an editee, I\u2019m aware that I present a number of quirks. Over time, we\u2019ve converged on a", "that works excellently. In a general way, I\u2019ve resisted standard punctuation if it seems to get in the way of an effect I wanted. Our battles over the placement of commas have pretty much ended with a happy compromise. Although I like semicolons, I don\u2019t like them in my own fiction. I can\u2019t justify this prejudice except to say that it has something to do with flow. I read everything aloud until it sounds right to me, and what a semicolon, or dash, does, often doesn\u2019t sound right read aloud. It occurs to me that it took Elsa and you both to curb my inclination to write insanely long scenes.", "Although I had published the stories, which were themselves wonderful, nothing could have prepared me for the sweep and pleasure of reading", ". As I remember you first gave me a section that left me stranded in the middle of the narrator\u2019s gripping journey through the desert, and I didn\u2019t know how I could wait for the next installment.", "An unforgettable moment in our adaptation to each other occurred when you returned a manuscript copy of the first part of", "with a blizzard of green check marks in the margins. I interpreted them as suggestions to delete those passages. Very alarming, as these passages were some of my favorites! As it turned out, the green checks were markers for some of", "favorite passages.", "Once long after the book was published, I found the outline of the novel you\u2019d submitted and I was amazed at how accurate it was. This had a funny consequence, because", "had changed somewhat from its outline, and I missed a major thrust of the book the first time through since I was anticipating a different turn of events.", "This is where I must praise your remarkable creative patience with me. Writing", "with the determination to make it a short, concentrated chamber work resulted in a heroic (from my standpoint!), and crazed struggle against my recurring inclination to write everything I want to say. The book", "and was, more than once, over 400 pages. I\u2019d promised and determined to take it downstairs to Elsa every couple of weeks as I progressed, mainly because she knows so well this tendency/compulsion of mine. Like an addict, I made excuses. I couldn\u2019t possibly show her 400 pages of a supposed 180-page novel, and I couldn\u2019t stop writing. I was in distress. In my defense, I\u2019ll say that I didn\u2019t respond calmly to certain interruptions of a personal sort. Hard things. Very late one night, I woke Elsa up to tell her I\u2019d given up on", ". She got out a pad and started asking questions about what I\u2019d done so far, and together, over hours, we deconstructed the novel, reducing it to its essence, which I\u2019d lost sight of but which she was able to discern and persuade me of. So I began again, grateful for your patience, her interventions, and with the assistance of a course of Cymbalta, a drug prescribed specifically for focus problems by a psychiatrist Elsa located, I reduced the 400 pages to 236. I\u2019d like though, both to tell what helped me and not to seem to recommend this drug: I started the weaning process the day I wrote the last words of", ", and even done gradually, the detox was a baroque and grueling experience for which I hadn\u2019t been prepared.", "Your novels", "and", "are a unique mixture of social comedy in the grand tradition combined with political or intellectual argument. When it came to editing the novels, I think most of my suggestions were about cutting some of the political or religious arguments down, particularly in", ", which had grown very long. Did you mind?", "No. I knew what would happen with", "if I sent to you, for example, Morel\u2019s takedown of Paul\u2019s hijacking of early Christianity. You\u2019re lucky it never reached you! You and Elsa colluded in cutting a byway about rock art in the Tsodilo Hills in Botswana. There was an overall feeling about more cuts being needed so as to get more quickly to the explosive (figuratively and literally) events in the Kalahari Desert, but when it came down to it, you were lenient, for which I thank you.", "That reminds me to thank Elsa here, officially, for being the first editor of your work, making life much easier for me and more fun, too, since we often end up with the three of us having an opinion on a wording or something. Those discussions can last for several days and are stimulating to have. Your immense and sometimes arcane vocabulary gives your editor, copy editor, and readers a workout.", "", "is I think the only book in which the issue of people resorting to their dictionaries has come up. I thought it was clear in the book, but I guess it wasn\u2019t, as I still occasionally have to explain that Karen Ann Hoyt\u2019s extensive vocabulary was built as part of her ladder up and out of her disadvantaged origins. It\u2019s about her, of course, and not about the precise meaning of every word she uses.", "I should acknowledge that Karen didn\u2019t like her name, and the reader doesn\u2019t learn the narrator\u2019s name until she reappears in", ".
