This disparity between material and tone made literary agents and publishers uneasy when the manuscript first crossed their desk: Rabbits, Adams says in his introduction to newer editions of the book, were considered a topic too \u201cbabyish\u201d to appeal to an older audience, while the writing was too complex and literary for the sorts of younger children for whom rabbits would be a logical selling point.", "Adams\u2019 intentions aside, it is certain that many, many children too young for", "found their way to it, via either well-meaning relatives who scooped a bucolic-looking copy from a bookstore without investigating further, or from children\u2019s libraries, where it often occupies a position of honor.

A new language, be it Adams\u2019 Lapine or High Elvish or Klingon, is no more baffling than the whys and hows of adult interaction.

As the parent of an autistic child, I have come to see the subtle cues most of us think of as instinctual\u2014the physical shifting and wrist-glancing that signify a readiness to end a conversation, inquiring politely after what an acquaintance did over the weekend despite being utterly indifferent to the answer\u2014as the learned dialect they are.
