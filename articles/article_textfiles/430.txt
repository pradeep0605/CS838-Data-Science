The land, given to my dad by his mother as a wedding present, had once been a cotton field. Of the yearly rituals involved with the garden, my favorite was the October tilling. A relative who made his living as a real farmer would come down to the house with his professional till and run it through our ground, turning the brittle old corn stalks and bean vines from the previous harvest under so they could disintegrate and enrich the soil for the coming spring\u2019s planting. There was always something refreshing about it, seeing the topsoil unburdened of all that dead weight\u2014not far off emotionally from the Sunday cycle of confession and forgiveness.", "Pardon me for waxing misty about the Lowder family garden. In her quietly brilliant book", ", Tracy Thompson writes that Southerners have\u2014or at least imagine they have\u2014a unique relationship to dirt:", "\"Southerners may live in the heart of Manhattan, in a penthouse in Pairs, or in a condo in Buckhead\u2014but if they identify themselves as Southerners, it means that somewhere, and probably not very far back, they have a close personal connection to the land: relatives who live in the rural South, a grandfather who farmed, a small town that is the ancestral family home, a cousin up in some holler who still talks with a twang. Lifelong residents of, say, Kansas may also lay claim to agrarian roots, but they don\u2019t celebrate it the way Southerners tend to, laboring as so many of us do under the delusion that we have a special, mystical attachment to The Land.\"", "Thompson knows exactly why I maintain my delusional dirt attachment\u2014my potted herbs in Harlem somehow don\u2019t satisfy it\u2014but that tilling I remember so well gets at another point her book, a rigorous psychological profile told in the easy drawl of a homecoming story, has right about \u201cour\u201d people.", "The problem with the modern South, as Thompson sees it, is the region\u2019s desperate, almost pathological desire to till under a whole mess of historical refuse so that it can get on with being and branding itself \u201cnew.\u201d But the difference is", "remnants\u2014horrific racial violence, Jim Crow-era indignities, Lost Cause mythology, and, of course, the noxious sludge of slavery itself\u2014will not fertilize the land; they will blight it. Indeed, since they have already been salt on the Southern earth for the 150 years since the Civil War, Thompson hopes that the ongoing sesquicentennial will show her fellow Southerners finally ready to suspend their famed cordiality for a spell in order to honestly, purgatively sort through the trash.", "A Yankee couldn\u2019t get away with this book. But Thompson\u2019s upbringing in Georgia allows for an intimacy of insight (not to mention a pleasing front-porch cadence) that tempers her chastisements with a weary strain of compassion. She loves the South and, though she recognizes its many flaws, ultimately wants to see it heal. The medicine required is obvious from the outset: The South must face \u201cthe way it has assiduously cultivated, refined, and tended\u201d the \u201cmyths, distortions, and strategic omissions\u201d that define its deeply skewed sense of history. Southerners, Thompson notes, echoing the historian Carl Degler, have a peculiar sense of \u201ctwo-ness\u201d\u2014that is, of cherishing their identity but knowing, if only in their guts, that something is fundamentally amiss behind the sweet tea and", "s.", "On this diagnostic tour of the South\u2019s kudzu-lined highways, Thompson\u2019s cartographic eye is keen. She notices, for instance, when roads cross the railroad tracks into the", "or when they carry her past new megachurches proclaiming a brand of evangelicalism that does not comport with the gentle piety she recalls from her youth. In recounting the experience of feeling singled-out in a Baptist church that should have been welcoming (the day\u2019s theme was about differentiating \u201ctrue\u201d Christians from poseurs), Thompson notes, with Southern understatement, that \u201cthe sermon that morning was enough to make a person wonder.\u201d", "Thompson also worries about how many roads now pass by Big Agra tracts instead of family farms and through hazy suburban sprawl instead of more sensibly\u2014and sustainably\u2014arranged communities. Most powerfully, she demands we remember that, not so long ago, people traveled in droves down from Atlanta to witness \u201cthe spectacle of a human being hacked up into pieces and roasted alive.\u201d Southern roads, Thompson shows us, are haunted by the heat shimmers of the past and potholed by uncertainties in the present\u2014and we must grapple with both if we\u2019re ever going to get anywhere.", "Courtesy of Dayna Smith", "Some patch-jobs should be easy. For example, though many Southerners have been flustered by the influx of \u201cMexicans\u201d (no matter the diversity of their", "national origins) into states like North Carolina over the past 20 years or so, Thompson points out the irony of rejecting a group of people whose conservative, family-centered morals almost exactly match a Southern ideal that is quickly in decline among whites. It may turn out that the much-maligned Mexican is more Southern than shrimp and grits\u2014all that\u2019s necessary, as Thompson jokes in a chapter title, is the addition of a little salsa.", "Demographic shifts aside, Thompson\u2019s analysis is most incisive\u2014and heartfelt\u2014when she turns to the South\u2019s \u201cBig Lie.\u201d In high school, I encountered this lie from the well-meaning mouth of a history teacher (who spent his weekends as a Civil War re-enactor\u2014go figure). Having been primed by a steady and totally disproportionate diet of \u201cSouth Carolina history\u201d (read: Civil War history) since elementary school, I was more than happy to accept the notion that the \u201cWar of Northern Aggression\u201d was an equally valid title for the period of American history between 1861-1865 and that slavery was really only a minor issue in the decision to go to war. Abraham Lincoln was also a terrible president, constitutionally speaking (that part is somewhat true), and secession was and is a completely legal option in the toolbox of, you guessed it,", ". Thompson uses fascinating archival research to show how upsettingly common my indoctrination into \u201cLost Cause\u201d mythology is across the South to this day, thanks primarily to the curriculum-setting efforts of the founding members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.", "And I\u2019m still not free of it, as I was reminded when I viscerally bristled at", "surrounding Spielberg\u2019s", "in which no quarter was given to the idea that some", "of the South\u2019s actions after the war might be excused by vengeful treatment at the hands of the Union. Presented with that kind of response, my high-school self suffers visions of Sherman burning Columbia. And then the familiar whispers of", "and", "start to creep in. Only when my adult brain intervenes am I reminded that, oh yes, there are historical facts to contend with\u2014like the fact that those fires may well have been set by Confederates.", "But then, historical facts and historical feelings are difficult to marry. \u201cA corollary to the lack of historical awareness is a certain lack of self-awareness,\u201d Thompson writes. So many of us Southerners do not know\u2014or are not willing to know\u2014the factual truth of our own history (even as, ironically, many of us are family-Bible-", "with a", "of the past), and so we do not know ourselves very well either.", "Thompson knows that we are a capable, adaptable people but that we all too often think on a small, immediate scale. We love our families and close friends fiercely\u2014these days, whatever color they are\u2014and yet we cannot seem to address the larger problems of racial inequality and poverty corroding the steel roots of cities like Atlanta. We value personal property, private space, local autonomy, and the support of our neighbors and community, but those same values blind us to the fact that some struggles require cooperation on a larger, dare I say it, governmental scale. To truly refresh the land and make it ready for growth, we Southerners, white and black alike, must clean up some big, nasty, unpleasant shit. If we heed Thompson\u2019s plea, if we can try together to finally detoxify those battlefields of the heart and mind, then maybe the South can actually be \u201cnew\u201d\u2014not merely rise again, but truly bloom.", "---", "by Tracy Thompson.
