{"Body": ["Illustrations by Danica Novgorodoff", "Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnam Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess, the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical changes, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.", "\u201cHark at the wind,\u201d said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.", "\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d said the latter, grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. \u201cCheck.\u201d", "\u201cI should hardly think that he\u2019d come to-night,\u201d said his father, with his hand poised over the board.", "\u201cMate,\u201d replied the son.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of living so far out,\u201d bawled Mr. White, with sudden and unlooked-for violence; \u201cof all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way places to live in, this is the worst. Pathway\u2019s a bog, and the road\u2019s a torrent. I don\u2019t know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d", "\u201cNever mind, dear,\u201d said his wife, soothingly; \u201cperhaps you\u2019ll win the next one.\u201d", "Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. The words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.", "\u201cThe first man had his three wishes. I don\u2019t know what the first two were, but the third was for death.\u201d", "\u201cThere he is,\u201d said Herbert White, as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.", "The old man rose with hospitable haste, and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, \u201cTut, tut!\u201d and coughed gently as her husband entered the room, followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.", "\u201cSergeant-Major Morris,\u201d he said, introducing him.", "The sergeant-major shook hands, and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly while his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.", "At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.", "\u201cTwenty-one years of it,\u201d said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. \u201cWhen he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him.\u201d", "\u201cHe don\u2019t look to have taken much harm,\u201d said Mrs. White, politely.", "\u201cI\u2019d like to go to India myself,\u201d said the old man, \u201cjust to look round a bit, you know.\u201d", "\u201cBetter where you are,\u201d said the sergeant-major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass, and sighing softly, shook it again.", "\u201cI should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers,\u201d said the old man. \u201cWhat was that you started telling me the other day about a monkey\u2019s paw or something, Morris?\u201d", "\u201cNothing,\u201d said the soldier, hastily. \u201cLeastways nothing worth hearing.\u201d", "\u201cMonkey\u2019s paw?\u201d said Mrs. White, curiously.", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps,\u201d said the sergeant-major, offhandedly.", "His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him.", "\u201cTo look at,\u201d said the sergeant-major, fumbling in his pocket, \u201cit\u2019s just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy.\u201d", "He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.", "\u201cAnd what is there special about it?\u201d inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.", "\u201cIt had a spell put on it by an old fakir,\u201d said the sergeant-major, \u201ca very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people\u2019s lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it.\u201d", "His manner was so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter jarred somewhat.", "\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you have three, sir?\u201d said Herbert White, cleverly.", "The soldier regarded him in the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth. \u201cI have,\u201d he said, quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.", "\u201cAnd did you really have the three wishes granted?\u201d asked Mrs. White.", "\u201cI did,\u201d said the sergeant-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.", "\u201cAnd has anybody else wished?\u201d persisted the old lady.", "\u201cThe first man had his three wishes. Yes,\u201d was the reply; \u201cI don\u2019t know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That\u2019s how I got the paw.\u201d", "His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.", "\u201cIf you\u2019ve had your three wishes, it\u2019s no good to you now, then, Morris,\u201d said the old man at last. \u201cWhat do you keep it for?\u201d", "The soldier shook his head. \u201cFancy, I suppose,\u201d he said, slowly. \u201cI did have some idea of selling it, but I don\u2019t think I will. It has caused enough mischief already. Besides, people won\u2019t buy. They think it\u2019s a fairy tale; some of them, and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward.\u201d", "\u201cIf you could have another three wishes,\u201d said the old man, eyeing him keenly, \u201cwould you have them?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the other. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.", "\u201cBetter let it burn,\u201d said the soldier, solemnly.", "\u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, Morris,\u201d said the other, \u201cgive it to me.\u201d", "\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said his friend, doggedly. \u201cI threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don\u2019t blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire again like a sensible man.\u201d", "The other shook his head and examined his new possession closely. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d he inquired.", "\u201cHold it up in your right hand and wish aloud,\u201d said the sergeant-major, \u201cbut I warn you of the consequences.\u201d", "\u201cSounds like the Arabian Nights,\u201d said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me?\u201d", "Her husband drew the talisman from pocket, and then all three burst into laughter as the sergeant-major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.", "\u201cIf you must wish,\u201d he said, gruffly, \u201cwish for something sensible.\u201d", "Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second instalment of the soldier\u2019s adventures in India.", "\u201cIf the tale about the monkey\u2019s paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us,\u201d said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time for him to catch the last train, \u201cwe sha\u2019nt make much out of it.\u201d", "\u201cDid you give him anything for it, father?\u201d inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.", "\u201cA trifle,\u201d said he, colouring slightly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away.\u201d", "\u201cLikely,\u201d said Herbert, with pretended horror. \u201cWhy, we\u2019re going to be rich, and famous and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can\u2019t be henpecked.\u201d", "He darted round the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs. White armed with an antimacassar.", "Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to wish for, and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said, slowly. \u201cIt seems to me I\u2019ve got all I want.\u201d", "\u201cIf you only cleared the house, you\u2019d be quite happy, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. \u201cWell, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that \u2018ll just do it.\u201d", "His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down at the piano and struck a few impressive chords.", "\u201cI wish for two hundred pounds,\u201d said the old man distinctly.", "A fine crash from the piano greeted the words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.", "\u201cIt moved,\u201d he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor.", "\u201cAs I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see the money,\u201d said his son as he picked it up and placed it on the table, \u201cand I bet I never shall.\u201d", "\u201cIt must have been your fancy, father,\u201d said his wife, regarding him anxiously.", "He shook his head. \u201cNever mind, though; there\u2019s no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same.\u201d", "They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled upon all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the night.", "\u201cI expect you\u2019ll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed,\u201d said Herbert, as he bade them good-night, \u201cand something horrible squatting up on top of the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains.\u201d", "He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last face was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey\u2019s paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.", "In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shrivelled little paw was pitched on the sideboard with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.", "\u201cI suppose all old soldiers are the same,\u201d said Mrs. White. \u201cThe idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?\u201d", "\u201cMight drop on his head from the sky,\u201d said the frivolous Herbert.", "\u201cMorris said the things happened so naturally,\u201d said his father, \u201cthat you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence.\u201d", "\u201cWell, don\u2019t break into the money before I come back,\u201d said Herbert as he rose from the table. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you.\u201d", "His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband\u2019s credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman\u2019s knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired sergeant-majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor\u2019s bill.", "\u201cHerbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home,\u201d she said, as they sat at dinner.", "\u201cI dare say,\u201d said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; \u201cbut for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I\u2019ll swear to.\u201d", "\u201cYou thought it did,\u201d said the old lady soothingly.", "\u201cI say it did,\u201d replied the other. \u201cThere was no thought about it; I had just\u2014- What\u2019s the matter?\u201d", "His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connection with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs. White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.", "She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband\u2019s coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit, for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.", "She saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other\u2019s averted face.", "\u201cI\u2014was asked to call,\u201d he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. \u201cI come from \u2018Maw and Meggins.\u2019\u201d", "The old lady started. \u201cIs anything the matter?\u201d she asked, breathlessly. \u201cHas anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?\u201d", "Her husband interposed. \u201cThere, there, mother,\u201d he said, hastily. \u201cSit down, and don\u2019t jump to conclusions. You\u2019ve not brought bad news, I\u2019m sure, sir;\u201d and he eyed the other wistfully.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d began the visitor.", "\u201cIs he hurt?\u201d demanded the mother, wildly.", "The visitor bowed in assent. \u201cBadly hurt,\u201d he said, quietly, \u201cbut he is not in any pain.\u201d", "\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d said the old woman, clasping her hands. \u201cThank God for that! Thank\u2014\u201d", "She broke off suddenly as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned upon her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other\u2019s averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling old hand upon his. There was a long silence.", "\u201cHe was caught in the machinery,\u201d said the visitor at length in a low voice.", "\u201cCaught in the machinery,\u201d repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion, \u201cyes.\u201d", "He sat staring blankly out at the window, and taking his wife\u2019s hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting-days nearly forty years before.", "\u201cHe was the only one left to us,\u201d he said, turning gently to the visitor. \u201cIt is hard.\u201d", "The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. \u201cThe firm wished me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,\u201d he said, without looking round. \u201cI beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders.\u201d", "There was no reply; the old woman\u2019s face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband\u2019s face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action.", "\u201cI was to say that \u2018Maw and Meggins\u2019 disclaim all responsibility,\u201d continued the other. \u201cThey admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son\u2019s services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation.\u201d", "Mr. White dropped his wife\u2019s hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, \u201cHow much?\u201d", "\u201cTwo hundred pounds,\u201d was the answer.", "Unconscious of his wife\u2019s shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.", "In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to a house steeped in shadow and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen \u2014something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.", "But the days passed, and expectation gave place to resignation\u2014the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes miscalled, apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.", "It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.", "\u201cCome back,\u201d he said, tenderly. \u201cYou will be cold.\u201d", "\u201cIt is colder for my son,\u201d said the old woman, and wept afresh.", "The sound of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.", "\u201cThe paw!\u201d she cried wildly. \u201cThe monkey\u2019s paw!\u201d", "He started up in alarm. \u201cWhere? Where is it? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d", "She came stumbling across the room toward him. \u201cI want it,\u201d she said, quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve not destroyed it?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s in the parlour, on the bracket,\u201d he replied, marvelling. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.", "\u201cI only just thought of it,\u201d she said, hysterically. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of it before? Why didn\u2019t you think of it?\u201d", "\u201cThink of what?\u201d he questioned.", "\u201cThe other two wishes,\u201d she replied, rapidly. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had one.\u201d", "\u201cWas not that enough?\u201d he demanded, fiercely.", "\u201cNo,\u201d she cried, triumphantly; \u201cwe\u2019ll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.\u201d", "The man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs. \u201cGood God, you are mad!\u201d he cried, aghast.", "\u201cGet it,\u201d she panted; \u201cget it quickly, and wish\u2014Oh, my boy, my boy!\u201d", "Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. \u201cGet back to bed,\u201d he said, unsteadily. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are saying.\u201d", "\u201cWe had the first wish granted,\u201d said the old woman, feverishly; \u201cwhy not the second?\u201d", "\u201cA coincidence,\u201d stammered the old man.", "\u201cGo and get it and wish,\u201d cried his wife, quivering with excitement.", "The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. \u201cHe has been dead ten days, and besides he\u2014I would not tell you else, but\u2014I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?\u201d", "\u201cBring him back,\u201d cried the old woman, and dragged him toward the door. \u201cDo you think I fear the child I have nursed?\u201d", "He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantelpiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.", "Even his wife\u2019s face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.", "\u201cWish!\u201d she cried, in a strong voice.", "\u201cIt is foolish and wicked,\u201d he faltered.", "\u201cWish!\u201d repeated his wife.", "He raised his hand. \u201cI wish my son alive again.\u201d", "The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.", "He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until, with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a minute or two afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.", "Neither spoke, but lay silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.", "At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.", "The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d cried the old woman, starting up.", "\u201cA rat,\u201d said the old man in shaking tones\u2014\u201da rat. It passed me on the stairs.\u201d", "His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Herbert!\u201d she screamed. \u201cIt\u2019s Herbert!\u201d", "She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.", "\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he whispered hoarsely.", "\u201cIt\u2019s my boy; it\u2019s Herbert!\u201d she cried, struggling mechanically. \u201cI forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door.\u201d", "\u201cFor God\u2019s sake don\u2019t let it in,\u201d cried the old man, trembling.", "\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of your own son,\u201d she cried, struggling. \u201cLet me go. I\u2019m coming, Herbert; I\u2019m coming.\u201d", "There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman\u2019s voice, strained and panting.", "\u201cThe bolt,\u201d she cried, loudly. \u201cCome down. I can\u2019t reach it.\u201d", "But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If he could only find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey\u2019s paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.", "The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road.", "Illustrations by Danica Novgorodoff", "", "W.W.
