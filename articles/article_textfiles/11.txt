For some, they inscribe a Venn diagram with poetry looking out through the small eye of their overlap. For others they suggest a binary\u2014beauty or truth, pick one. With", "his 12", "book of poems, Carl Phillips once again seems torn. His poems are driven by the desire to transform truth into beauty. Yet they are scrupulous in their acknowledgement that the truth has, more often than not, been left behind. As in his previous,", "Phillips casts his long line across short poems, reaching for something inhuman, astonishing, extremely beautiful, and frequently far from home.", "So the book\u2019s title is to some extent aspirational: Reconnaissance, after all, involves both going out and coming back. But Phillips isn\u2019t in search of knowledge. He wants power, danger, an annihilating beauty that can be chosen but not harnessed. Strangely, his tool for that reconnaissance is, essentially, a shrug. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he writes. \u201cWho cared?\u201d \u201cWho says?\u201d \u201cSo what?\u201d Set into the lush complexity of Phillips\u2019 poetry, these conversational throwaways suggest that human appetite can make everything else, even beauty, even beautiful language, unnecessary. But again, the poems ask: \u201cSo what?\u201d", "The book opens with the title piece. At just five lines, \u201cReconnaissance\u201d encapsulates much of what the collection", "as a whole, will do:", "The poem, which starts off in near-pedantic certainty, turns out to be almost maddeningly hedged: \u201cI\u2019m told,\u201d \u201cAs for,\u201d \u201cmaybe so,\u201d \u201cwhy not.\u201d Even the final image is hard to parse: Shouldn\u2019t reflected light move", "the snow? And what would it even mean to move like that?", "In many ways, Phillips reminds me of John Ashbery, a poet I admire, but mostly, these days, from afar. For many, Ashbery\u2019s elusive presence in poetry has been life- and mind-altering. For me, feeling lost so much of the time, it heightens a loneliness that\u2019s already there. So I wonder about the thrill I feel reading Phillips, who is also elusive, also playing with different registers of language, also willing to go much further into unreality than I ever would or could.", "But Phillips insists on registering the cost of going so far\u2014and that choice dramatizes, in turn, the forces that compel us to incur the cost nonetheless. The world of beauty he moves into is frequently self-destructive or destructive of others. He consistently finds loveliness in things like fog and ruins, sites of damage or effacement that seem to glorify what\u2019s been erased. In poem after poem, the flesh is torn: \u201cYou are the knife/ and you are what the knife/ has opened, says the wind.\u201d \u201cBut what if suffering is in fact for nothing\u2014/ no particular wisdom after, blooming flower-like,/ blood in the water.\u201d These statements are always contingent (in these cases, on the wind and set inside \u201cwhat if\u201d), but that doesn\u2019t make the harm that they incarnate any less real. Nor does it lessen the compulsion to go there again.", "There\u2019s a valedictory quality to many of these poems\u2014acceptance, self-awareness, humility, something (perhaps someone) lost, and a hint of weary gratitude, too\u2014but not the kind of valediction that reaches for the past. Instead, the poems play out in the haunted contingencies of a single moment. \u201cLately,\u201d Phillips writes repeatedly, and it feels like that\u2019s enough, to wander off into whatever is only lately true.", "In many of these new poems, Phillips speaks to someone unidentified, possibly unreal but partly grounding, picking up in the middle of conversations, as he does here at the start of \u201cThe Darker Powers\u201d:", "The poem keeps spinning out from there, that sentence, the poem\u2019s second, going on for another 16 lines before yielding to a third sentence that brings the poem to a close.", "Photo by Reston Allen", "You could get lost in those sentences, the slips through metaphor and across associations, the reconsiderations, the hedges, were it not for the care with which Phillips manages them, their grammatical unities a long rope he lays down to mark the way back. At times, that well-mapped movement away from sense feels mild, no more radical than the playful yoking of words into unlikely terms: \u201cthe river, unspooling,/ unspooled itself with all the generosity/ of a mirror, water\u2019s cool, see-throughable/ commitment\u2026. \u201d But then it becomes, in the same poem, a matter of almost animal urgency, civilization seeking new footing beyond its own perimeters, too late to turn back:", "Late this August, in", ", Phillips responded to a question about his political role as a gay and biracial poet:", "This is lovely and largely true. And we are too willing, too often, to ask more of writers who come from historically (and presently) oppressed groups. But the overlap Phillips mentions often, at least for me, gets lost in his brilliant mythologizing, which seems to arc, within its brief contingencies, toward a place outside of time. More than most other living and recent American poets I cherish, Phillips writes poems that stay inside the book.", "moves through a world in which harm is a part of nature: gravitational, nearly inevitable. So when I put the book down and step back into a world where harm is also structural, where people have jobs and bills and much of our beauty is allowed for by systems we try to ignore, I find that the pleasures of his poems are hard to apply, the truth of our political lives the one truth he slips clear of.", "Yet I still go back to his books.", "I do so because most lives, mine included, ache for redemption, even as they remind us that most forms of redemption are fundamentally untrue. And I do so because Phillips writes so many lines like these, from \u201cSince You Ask,\u201d in which ardent thought threads through its own devices but never tangles or snaps:", "\u201cIf I don\u2019t think about,\u201d he writes, then thinks with remarkable agility of what such unthinking allows\u2014darkness becoming a source of order, that order becoming mobile and alert, then populated, a clearing, the chance to recommence, which the poem does. Phillips blinds himself so that he might see, then looks intensely. He makes extraordinary beauty true by acknowledging that the beauty we long for is often unreal.", "---", "by Carl Phillips.
