{"Body": ["Illustration by Peter Bagge", "For the last few years I\u2019ve been writing a scholarly book about Shel Silverstein\u2019s life and work. Yet, after five years of labor, I\u2019ve recently come to realize that my book will very possibly never be published.", "Why not? Well, certainly not because there\u2019s a glut of other books about Silverstein. Only one popular biography exists, and I guess if you count the Shel-centric", ",", "by Silverstein\u2019s lifelong friend, Marv Gold, you could up that number to two. However, these books don\u2019t talk much about", ". A frustratingly small number of scholarly and critical studies of", "type put his complex and unconventional life in conversation with his art.", "And it\u2019s not because there\u2019s nothing to write about. Most of us know Silverstein for his children\u2019s poetry and picture books (such as", "and", "), but fewer realize he got his start writing gag strips for", "while serving a tour of duty in Korea. He created decades of work in a variety of genres for", ", and he was also an amazingly prolific songwriter (composing hundreds of songs recorded by the likes of Johnny Cash, Lucinda Williams, Gordon Lightfoot, Marianne Faithfull, Loretta Lynn, Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show, Dr. Dog, and My Morning Jacket). Shel authored scores of darkly comic short plays and even wrote a film script with David Mamet (1988\u2019s", ").", "Silverstein\u2019s an important figure, is what I\u2019m getting at. He lived an interesting life, and he produced more than his fair share of aesthetically and commercially successful art. So why has there been so little critical attention paid to such a provocative and prolific character, so little scholarship striving for the Big Picture? And why might my attempt to write this very kind of work potentially never appear in print? Put simply: because of Shel Silverstein\u2019s estate. Because it\u2019s so damned difficult to get permission to quote from his poems and songs, to illustrate claims with reproductions of his art\u2014even a tiny black-and-white reproduction of a comic panel or three or four lines of a song. I\u2019m not the only biographer of an important figure who has this problem. It has to change.", "It comes down to this: the Silverstein estate is especially reluctant to give out what\u2019s called \u201cpermissions,\u201d the right to quote from (or reproduce parts of) work protected by copyright. Last year an academic journal asked me to obtain permission to reproduce some of Silverstein\u2019s material in", "of mine they were about to publish. Most of the required images first appeared in", "; the magazine gave me an email address belonging to Silverstein\u2019s nephew, who evidently handles this kind of thing for the estate. I wrote this nephew several times, and after a handful of attempts over the course of months, I heard back from a law firm whose name seemed to come straight out of a Shel Silverstein poem: Solheim, Billing, and Grimmer.", "Sadly, I can\u2019t reproduce their letter because it\u2019s protected under copyright. (Recipients of letters own the", ", but the content of the letter\u2014or scans of the letter itself\u2014cannot be reproduced without the permission of the letter writer. You can imagine how frustrating this is for biographers.) Still, SB&G\u2019s five-sentence missive is easy to summarize: it forbade me not only from reproducing images for this one article, but from ever reproducing any of Silverstein\u2019s work\u2014song lyrics, poems, images, whatever\u2014in", "context. Ever. (Not quite \u201cever.\u201d Silverstein\u2019s work begins entering the public domain in 2051. Of course, that\u2019s assuming Disney doesn\u2019t have copyright law changed again when", "once more nears the borders of the public domain. Not a great assumption to make.)", "Now, I mentioned in my query that I was writing a book\u2014and I mentioned that the book discusses Silverstein\u2019s work for children alongside his work for adults; I also included a copy of", "I had written on the subject, an essay that doesn\u2019t shy away from the, shall we say, less G-rated details of his life and career: his womanizing, his songs about drugs and venereal disease, his work for", "But I wasn\u2019t asking permissions for the book. I made this clear in the request: I was asking to reproduce only a few images for this one article. And yet Silverstein\u2019s estate decided to muzzle me completely. They closed the letter with these words: \u201cOur clients appreciate your interest in the works of Shel Silverstein and wish you the best of luck in your other future endeavors.\u201d", "endeavor, however, they have sunk, and it\u2019s likely to remain unsalvageable as long as they control Silverstein\u2019s copyrighted work.", "And so I came up against the hard truth of the literary biographer: It\u2019s crucial to establish friendly relations with the estates of deceased (and more rarely, living) artists whose work is protected by copyright. You see, scholars have to request permission to reproduce more than a few lines of a copyrighted poem or song lyric. Or, more precisely, we don\u2019t", "to, but our publishers (largely academic, nonprofit university presses) tend to insist that we ask permission in order to protect themselves from lawsuits. You may have heard of something called \u201cfair use.\u201d One would think fair use was custom built to protect scholars and artists who want or need to reproduce excerpts from copyrighted work in the service of education or art or scholarship\u2014and one would be right. But whether we\u2019re protected or not, most presses prefer to play it safe and make scholars request permission.", "This situation is disastrous for serious scholarship for a number of reasons. Instead of simply writing what our research tells us, quoting what we need to quote, scholars are put in the position of hunting down permissions, a process that can take months. More absurdly, it puts our research and our conclusions at the (not so) tender mercies of the subjects of our scholarship (or, worse, the mercy of their estates). If scholars and critics know we need \u201cpermission\u201d to quote a few lines of a poem, a few panels of a comic, a verse of a song, we might\u2014and, sadly, too often do\u2014mellow out what might otherwise be more harsh or unsympathetic assessments. We might modify or neglect certain avenues of inquiry, might hesitate, say, to point out that many of Shel Silverstein\u2019s children\u2019s poems first appeared in", ", might not dwell on the fact that a beloved author/illustrator of children\u2019s books wrote and performed a song called \u201cFuck \u2019em,\u201d a song that includes the lyrics:", "Photo by Alice Ochs/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images", "We might steer clear of such controversial material for fear a permission request\u2014or a request to read manuscripts, to visit a private archive, to reproduce sections of unpublished material\u2014could be rejected by the estate should our work contravene its opinion about how an author or his work ought to be represented. (Although that five-line excerpt above should be covered by fair use, if this were an academic press and not", ", that press would", "more than likely insist I ask SB&G for permission to reproduce it. You can imagine how that would go.)", "My professional difficulties with the Silverstein estate are perhaps unusual\u2014flat-out refusal, in perpetuity, with no given reason: that is, a kind of censorship\u2014but it\u2019s an extreme case that illustrates a problem pervasive in the scholarly world. Other scholars have had difficulties similar to mine. Books and articles on Louis Zukofsky, Sylvia Plath, Adrienne Rich, Philip Larkin, and a host of others have died on the vine as a result of persnickety estates (or difficult artists). (Check out Ian Hamilton\u2019s", "for some particularly famous examples.) Other books have survived, but were born hobbled by the lack of quotation.

Similarly, scholarship on Disney,", ", and", "films, as well as comics owned by Marvel and DC, live out their lives on hard drives, never published, or see publication in adulterated form, a shadow of their author's intent, crucial images omitted and replaced by a weird kind of scholarly ekphrasis.

Everybody knows stories of novelists reviewing the work of their friends, poetic rivals going after each other in the press, lavishly illustrated encomiums to this or that artist published with the estate\u2019s blessing. The influence of estates on scholarship tarnishes public perception of scholarship, makes it even harder on most scholars, those who strive for objectivity, strive for honest and thorough discussion of works and artists we find important. And these estates, with the power to withhold permission when one writes what they don\u2019t want written\u2014the power to withhold permission simply because", "\u2014these shortsighted estates not only frustrate scholars, like me, but they fail in their role as stewards of the reputations of artists and writers with which they have been entrusted.", "So what\u2019s the solution? Sadly, these practices are so deeply entrenched, so natural to writers and presses and their editors and lawyers and, yes, to estate executors (and", "lawyers) that sometimes it seems all writers and scholars can do is mutter complaints to friends. If there is a solution, it requires that more scholars speak up. We need to out presses with too-strenuous permission guidelines (like Wayne State UP, who published my first book: a hard-working publisher of integrity who nonetheless should stand up for academic freedom, for the rights of the scholars and critics who write for them). We need to write essays like the one you\u2019re reading, explain to the public how unreasonable estates can be about policing what\u2019s said about the artists whose legacy they ostensibly curate.", "What we have here\u2014if you\u2019ll forgive the military metaphor\u2014is but one front in a larger war against the rigorous analysis of fact.
