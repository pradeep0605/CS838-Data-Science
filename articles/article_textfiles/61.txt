{"Body": ["Illustration by Gustavo Duarte", "The 1970s are often thought of as a time when big, utopian dreams were scrapped for cramped, personal hopes. That zeitgeist known as the Sixties\u2014all those fraught, sometimes fatal struggles for sociopolitical freedom and, too, for just plain fun\u2014gave way, we tend to think, to weariness and backlash, to Kent State and Watergate, Gerald Ford\u2019s \u201cWhip Inflation Now\u201d and Jimmy Carter\u2019s \u201cmalaise.\u201d", "Yet the \u201970s were also a time when many of the biggest\u2014and, it turns out, most enduring\u2014radio hits still dared to dream big. Very big.", "\u201cImagine,\u201d from 1971, is the example with the most obvious bumper-sticker recognition. But I\u2019m mostly thinking of a congregation of pop-soul records from early in the decade that were, as a rule, grittier and more complex, more grounded in material conditions than was John Lennon\u2019s ode to the positive power of thinking. Think of the Pointer Sisters\u2019 version of \u201cYes We Can Can\u201d and the O\u2019Jays\u2019 peace-and-love classic \u201cLove Train,\u201d or of Bill Withers\u2019 comforting, empowering, arm-around-the-shoulder sing-along \u201cLean on Me.\u201d Most especially, think of the Staple Singers\u2019 indomitable blast of funky, communal, human potential, 1972\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There.\u201d", "All of these records either implied or outright insisted that our nation\u2019s chasms of conflict and miscommunication\u2014between the rich and poor, squares and hippies, old and young, and between white and black in particular\u2014could yet be spanned. These era-defining hit singles declared that we could achieve a new, less imperfect union, and we didn\u2019t have to wait for an afterlife to get there, either. With roots in the African-American church, this worldview has been labeled by critic Craig Werner as the Gospel Impulse: Humans can cross over to the Promised Land, right here and right now, but only if we move beyond an exclusive focus on the saving of individual souls, or on the padding of individual bank accounts, and instead travel as a self-conscious community, roll up our sleeves, and work together. As Werner phrased it in", ", the Gospel Impulse is invested in the idea that \u201cNo one makes it alone. \u2026 [I]f we are going to \u2026 move on up, we\u2019ve got to connect. The music shows us how.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly right,\u201d Mavis Staples, the soul-and-gospel legend and the Staple Singers primary lead singer,", ". Then, as has long been her way, she moved immediately to memories of her father, Roebuck \u201cPops\u201d Staples, dead only a few years at the time. \u201cYou know, Pops would say that sometimes,\u201d she remembered. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018We don\u2019t have to die to go to heaven; heaven could be right here.\u2019 But he said we got to work together.", "\u201cWe got to work!\u201d", "* * *", "The Staples have such a great, distinctively American tale that it seems almost impossible, at this late date, that", "could be the first book ever written about the family. It\u2019s a good thing that Greg Kot, a longtime music journalist for the", ", has provided us with an able, engaging, and appreciative\u2014if frustratingly cursory\u2014look at the family and its music. Kot\u2019s recounting of the Staples story is momentous and rich, as it should be. I wish there were more of it.", "The basic outlines of the Staples saga are easy enough to find, but Kot traces it well. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Pops Staples toiled in the fields of Dockery Farms in the Mississippi Delta. He learned to play guitar, in part, by watching the performances of Charley Patton and Chester \u201cHowlin\u2019 Wolf\u201d Burnett, known to us as legendary blues players but known to Staples, at the time, as his co-workers. In 1936, Pops\u2014along with wife Oceola, daughter Cleotha, and son Pervis\u2014joined the last century\u2019s Great Migration and relocated to Chicago\u2019s South Side. Two more daughters were soon added to the family, Yvonne in 1937 and Mavis in \u201939, while Pops worked a series of stockyard and factory jobs and sang in a gospel sextet called the Trumpet Jubilees. In 1948, frustrated by his group mates\u2019 lack of commitment, he pulled a $7 pawn-shop guitar from the closet and announced, as Mavis has often recalled over the years, \u201cI\u2019m going to sing with my children.\u201d The first song he taught his kids to harmonize on was \u201cWill the Circle Be Unbroken,\u201d a song most associated, then as now, with another musical clan, the Carter Family. Pops knew it because it was included in many traditional black gospel songbooks. \u201cA better home is waiting,\u201d the song promises. \u201cIn the sky.\u201d", "The rest is gospel and pop history. The Staples established themselves by performing at Chicago\u2019s black churches, then began recording for a series of small independent record labels\u2014in the middle \u201950s, their version of the gospel standard \u201cUncloudy Day\u201d sold, as Pops always put it, \u201clike a rock and roll record\u201d\u2014before moving to Epic Records in 1965 and Stax in 1968. The Staples\u2019 distinctive style was backward glancing and cutting edge at once. On the one hand, it reminded transplanted black listeners of the rural harmonies they\u2019d left behind in the South. On the other, it anticipated the sounds of rock and soul, via Mavis\u2019 spirit-filled lead vocals and Pop\u2019s indelible blues-inflected tremolo guitar.", "They added more driving rhythms and fuller arrangements each step of the way, and they began to push beyond straight gospel material, reaching out to the predominantly white folk-music audience by performing at Carnegie Hall and the Newport Folk Festival and by being early adopters of the Bob Dylan songbook. All of this led to some comparatively lucrative bookings for a black gospel group. But it also linked the Staples to the headlines. Those topical Dylan songs like \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d and \u201cMasters of War,\u201d along with Staples\u2019 recordings of other folk and pop \u201cmessage songs\u201d\u2014not gospel per se but advocating for social progress in ways that were, by Pops\u2019 estimation, consistent with Christian principles\u2014both used and personified the Gospel Impulse, perhaps the era\u2019s key political and artistic tendency. That better home a-waiting didn\u2019t have to be in the sky. It could be on earth, too, where we need it.", "To that end, the group worked often with Martin Luther King Jr. (\u201cIf he can preach it, we can sing it,\u201d Pops said) and at other civil rights happenings. The title of the Staples\u2019 first Stax album pressed home the same point, describing not only the family but a movement:", ".", "Straight ahead were the Staples\u2019 biggest hits: \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There,\u201d of course, but also \u201cIf You\u2019re Ready (Come Go With Me),\u201d \u201cTouch a Hand, Make a Friend,\u201d and more. Each was an exemplar of the Gospel Impulse, not merely a morale-boosting soundtrack for social change but embodiment of the fun and funky world we might create\u2014and a model of how to make it.", "\u201cI know a place, y\u2019all,\u201d Mavis declares on \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There,\u201d her ragged\u2013but right\u2013gospel moan encouraging us to join her in the job of getting there, and its modified reggae soul groove pushing us to dance while we worked because she can\u2019t make it alone. \u201cSomebody help me,\u201d she implores. \u201cSomebody help me now!\u201d", "* * *", "Photo by Bill Hogan. Courtesy of Scribner.", "Gathering together anecdotes by turns harrowing and hilarious, and nearly always inspiring, Kot recounts the arc of the Staples\u2019 career in breezy, page-turning prose, and gives the principals plenty of room to talk for themselves. He quotes liberally, and fruitfully, from an unpublished Pops Staples memoir to which his children provided Kot access. And he also draws upon conversations with some of the family\u2019s good friends\u2014soul singer Jerry Butler, for instance, who grew up in the same Chicago neighborhood\u2014as well as with key collaborators and savvy observers, such as country singer Marty Stuart, Stax exec Al Bell, esteemed gospel critic Anthony Heilbut, and several others. Most of all, Kot relies upon interviews he\u2019s done with the surviving members of the family, Mavis in particular.", "That\u2019s a can\u2019t-fail narrative strategy. Mavis Staples is a gripping storyteller and has great stories to tell. There\u2019s the time, for instance, that young Mavis got a whipping for singing \u201cSince I Fell for You,\u201d a big R&B hit for Annie Laurie in 1947, at a school talent show. \u201cGrandma says, \u2018Oh, you singin\u2019 the blues, huh? You go out there and get me some switches.\u2019\u201d Or the tale of audience members wagering among themselves over whether the low, low lead vocals on early Staples records could actually be coming from Mavis, only a little girl at the time. Or the time she unwittingly integrated a Mississippi laundromat. Or dated Bob Dylan. And so on.", "Younger fans, who have necessarily discovered the Staples\u2019 one-of-a-kind gospel soul only recently, will embrace these stories, coming on nearly every page of", ", as revelations. Longtime followers will also enjoy hearing them, though they will be familiar from various newspaper and magazine profiles and from other soul and gospel books. Mavis does occasionally share with Kot some previously unknown and entertaining detail. \u201cThe Newport Folk Festival was our first kiss,\u201d she dishes about her relationship with Dylan. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone that.\u201d Mostly, though, to paraphrase Frank Rich in a recent", "on Stephen Sondheim, it appears that \u201cMavis has her story, and she\u2019s sticking to it.\u201d", "But a dearth of new anecdotes is not a significant problem. What I most crave from studies of this kind isn\u2019t detailed biography. What I want is a biographically focused examination of vital songs, performances, and recordings\u2014the things that made me eager to read about an artist in the first place. How does the music sound and feel? And, most importantly, how and why does the music matter?", "excels on that first score. Kot is an entertaining and informed tour guide of the highs and occasional lows of the Staples Singers catalog, and also of Mavis\u2019 remarkable series of 21", "-century solo recordings, cut with producers such as Ry Cooder and Jeff Tweedy. Kot mostly ignores that key second bunch of issues. He has little to say about the connections between the Staples\u2019 work and \u201cthe march up freedom\u2019s highway\u201d of his subtitle. That\u2019s where some guiding analytical principle, such as Craig Werner\u2019s Gospel Impulse, might have been enlightening.", "At the book\u2019s close, a 73-year-old Mavis Staples, her brother Pervis, and sister Yvonne walk, arms entwined, out of the church on the day of their late sister Cleotha\u2019s funeral as a choir sings \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There.\u201d \u201cTheir sister was gone,\u201d Kot writes, \u201cbut their work was not yet done.\u201d\u00a0 It is a moving moment, to put it mildly. I wished it had been made a little clearer what exactly that work had been, and what it would continue to be, in a world as suspicious of collective solutions and utopian dreams as our own.", "---", "by Greg Kot.
