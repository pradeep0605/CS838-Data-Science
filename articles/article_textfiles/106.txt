Despite the", "with which we often discuss them, cancerous cells are not invaders. Instead, they are one\u2019s own organs made strange, the body transformed into an instrument of its own undoing. Grappling with the horror of this feeling, Gubar speaks of the disease\u2019s \u201cimperialism of the not-me-in-me,\u201d a syntactical knot that encourages those bound up in it to untie themselves. An experience of exile from the self, cancer is frightening to the very extent that it is familiar on an almost cellular level.", "When we write about cancer, Gubar suggests, it\u2019s partly to make sense of and work through this experience of alienation. Pulled one way by our bodies and another by the doctors who would heal us, we write to regain some sense of agency. \u201cThe writing process enables a reconstitution of the self,\u201d she proposes in her preface, before going on to argue that it also allows us to reckon with the ways cancer changes that self: \u201cBe it angry or sorrowful, defiant or resigned, courageous or fearful, this emergent voice helps us understand who we are becoming.\u201d Gubar refuses to treat cancer as \u201ca rewarding opportunity.\u201d Nevertheless, the writing that cancer inspires can, paradoxically, let us rebuild on our own terms.", "Donald Gray", "Though Gubar\u2019s book bears the subtitle \u201cHow Words Heal,\u201d the point isn\u2019t\u2014and cannot be\u2014that writing cures us. (That, Gubar clearly states, is the work of doctors.) But she still holds that writing might serve as \u201ca restorative activity that supplements standard medical responses to cancer.\u201d Disease destroys life, but writing helps to amplify it, however much or little we might have left. \u201cWhereas cancer has been the bane of my life,\u201d Gubar observes, \u201cwriting has been its boon.\u201d Such labors cure only in the way salt cures a hunk of meat, making it a little smaller, a little easier to live with, and maybe even a little more delicious.", "The cult of positive thinking can provoke an impulse to self-censorship in patients, a desire not to trouble others with the ugly truth of one\u2019s own conditions. Though Gubar\u2019s suggested writing prompts don\u2019t demand negativity, they also refuse to shy away from it, thereby encouraging readers to push back against that inclination: \u201cCelebrate or castigate a doctor or nurse,\u201d she suggests in one list of possible topics. \u201cArgue for a specific improvement in cancer care,\u201d she proposes in another. Composing essays\u2014or poems, or lists, or diary entries\u2014along these lines might, she holds, help us distance ourselves from sickness, but it can only do so if we first engage with the reality of it. Thus, though she acknowledges that it\u2019s hard", "to write with others in mind, she aims to help patients write about their own experience in their own ways\u2014not as stories already told, not as cultural myths, not as comforting clich\u00e9s.", "This commitment to personal particularity may limit the book\u2019s usefulness for some. Observing that she and her fellow patients \u201chave had more than enough prescriptions,\u201d she declines to offer much in the way of definitive advice. Instead, much of the book records her own writing experiences, experiences that few readers will share\u2014partly because everyone\u2019s cancer is different, and partly because almost no one has the opportunity to blog about illness for the", ".", "Gubar does, however, survey a great deal of other work about cancer. Though such explorations crop up throughout, she makes them the focus of her second chapter, which looks at cancer memoirs, and of the third, in which she investigates other art works inspired by the disease. Though she\u2019s an accomplished critic, Gubar typically eschews close reading or theoretical analysis of these texts, instead offering plot summaries or descriptions of especially significant passages. The range of her reading is impressive, but these synopses are rarely engaging on their own, though in aggregate they reaffirm her insistence that there\u2019s no normative way of writing about cancer. Cancer in all its varieties\u2014from minor diagnoses like my papillary thyroid cancer to more aggressive conditions like Gubar\u2019s\u2014can mean many things in many ways, but all of them make the world a little more confusing. Gubar invites us to tarry with these befuddlements, working toward our own answers but accepting that they may not arrive.", "Etymologically speaking, a patient is one who suffers, but cancer patients must also", "patient, since they spend so much of their time waiting\u2014for treatment to begin or to end, for test results to arrive, for remission, for a cure.

I have been fortunate: On most days, the only memento of my own illness is the scar on my neck where my thyroid came out, there whenever I glance in the mirror.
