It\u2019s also perfectly representative of the disorienting synesthesia at work in much beauty marketing, where colors and nice smells and enticing textures and deliciousness tend to collapse into a single cynosure of desire. The advertising truism is that sex\u2014a pretty woman plus a product\u2014sells, regardless of whether the target consumer wants the woman or wants to be her or both. But in selling supplies for the maintenance of the female body, there\u2019s often another kind of confused hunger at play: Do you want to eat or be eaten?", "This is the fertile territory staked out by Alexandra Kleeman in her excellent first novel,", "Sprinkled with detailed summaries of invented advertisements, the book describes a consumer landscape just on the far side of plausible.

But B is a difficult roommate. She skulks around the house drinking lemon-flavored vodka and resenting A\u2019s absences. She requires constant attention.

Increasingly, A worries that B is plotting some kind of attempt to steal A\u2019s identity.

A and C have sex while C watches porn\u2014but not, as A first thinks, because he wants to emulate the activities depicted.
