It\u2019s also about the search for beauty in unlikely places, and about the way strangers can help us and betray us. And, somehow, it\u2019s about competitive weightlifting too.

This is a book in which a bizarre aside about a suitcase full of glass dildos can give way to a frank reflection on depression. Thanks in large part to Hanselmann\u2019s subtly complex cartooning, those tonal shifts never feel jarring\u2014to the contrary, they\u2019re proof that it\u2019s possible to mine joy from even the most miserable scenarios.", "In", ", a desperate time traveler struggles to prevent his wife\u2019s murder\u2014and like all time travelers, he makes a mess of things along the way. Those soft-science fiction trappings aside, this is a deeply human tale, clear-eyed about the emotional weight of personal history. Assured and careful as ever, Daniel Clowes\u2019 artwork precisely conveys his characters\u2019 alienation from one another, even as his narrative largely eschews the misanthropy that pervades many of his earlier novels.

Where a lesser book might tell a story about coming to terms with such a loss, this one dwells on the unbearable fact of it. Hart\u2019s often jagged line work conveys a sense of persistent emotional intensity, of ugly feelings that linger long after the events he describes.
