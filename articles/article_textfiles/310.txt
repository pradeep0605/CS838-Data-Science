{"Body": ["Maddie Edgar", "There is a great deal of looking going on in Siri Hustvedt\u2019s new collection of essays,", ". The first section scrutinizes various artists, Hustvedt\u2019s time in therapy, her stint teaching writing at a psychiatric clinic, Susan Sontag\u2019s 1964 lecture about porn, and\u2013 wonderfully\u2014Karl Ove Knausgaard, in a silky rumination on literary sexism that seethes with feminist (and personal) pique. The second chunk of the book, \u201cThe Delusions of Certainty,\u201d is a 200-page investigation of the mind-body problem that ranges through philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience in order to blur neat distinctions between reason and emotion, nature and nurture, matter and spirit, and masculinity and femininity. Synthesizing an astonishing mass of material, Hustvedt argues that the Cartesian split between psyche and soma has led us to discount powerful interrelationships among, for instance, our senses, intellect, mood, and biological disposition. It\u2019s heady stuff.", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "Hustvedt, who declares that \u201cmy philosophical leanings have caused me to embrace an embodied, motor-sensory-affective relational mammalian reality,\u201d stakes out the position of mediator. She is both a novelist and a lecturer in psychiatry at Cornell; her book attempts to bridge a chasm between science and the humanities. \u201cI have come to live in the gulf\u201d of \u201cmutual incomprehension\u201d that separates \u201cphysical scientists\u201d from \u201cliterary intellectuals,\u201d she writes, quoting the physicist and author C.P. Snow. Her methods are mostly associative. She juxtaposes research from MIT\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Lab (on robots that navigate the environment without a central control) with Diderot\u2019s vision of swarming bees in", ". She revives the Aristotelian image of the mind as a wax tablet and Dante\u2019s portrayal of consciousness as an \u201cinner book\u201d to frame the contemporary, cog-sci model of the brain as a computer.", "These connections can be fascinating. Roaming freely in biology, philosophy, and pop culture, Hustvedt draws a link between Richard Dawkins\u2019 \u201cselfish gene\u201d\u2014out to survive and thrive at all costs\u2014and Schopenhauer\u2019s insatiable will, and then remarks that both evoke the \u201ccapitalist hero, hoisted up by his proverbial bootstraps, aggressive, selfish, but oh so clever and rich.\u201d I loved her glosses on Darwin, which align the naturalist with the \u201ctender empiricism\u201d and Romantic mutability of the poet Goethe.", "These are pages intended to catch the shape of a writer\u2019s thoughts\u2014the tome remains more of a notebook than a series of persuasive essays, with all the indeterminacy and occasional solipsism that form entails. Hustvedt is prone to such musings as \u201cIt has become obvious to me that framing the mind is crucial to many kinds of research,\u201d and \u201cHuman beings are surely made of cells.\u201d She has a way of raptly declaiming banalities as if she were the first to ever think of them. \u201cNaming and conceptualization are vital to understanding,\u201d she informs us solemnly, \u201cbut meanings in language are not fixed.\u201d", "To the extent that this book advances an argument, it is this: that \u201cevery story implies a listener, and we learn how to tell stories to make sense of a life with \u2026 others.\u201d For Hustvedt, fiction (and therapy) inhabit \u201cthe realm of both \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019\u2014on what I call the axis of discourse or in the", ".\u201d \u201cThe between-zone,\u201d she continues, \u201cis established long before we learn language in the back-and-forth gestural, musical, and tactile exchanges between our infant selves and, usually, our mothers.\u201d This highfalutin notion\u2014that the preverbal commerce of babyhood establishes the rhythms that pulse beneath our conscious selves, that \u201cbefore we speak, we are creatures of relational music\u201d\u2014is at the center of her theory of knowledge. Knowledge, to her, is the convergence of thought, emotion, imagination, and memory: something fuller and deeper than what lies at the end of a train of intellectual reasoning. Hustvedt rejects the sterile rationalism of the dualists. \u201cMeanings,\u201d she insists, \u201care also found in the muscular, sensory, emotional realities of the human body.\u201d", "I submit that the point isn\u2019t", "weird shit Hustvedt has to say about hair but that she, with her uncommon penetration, is saying weird shit about hair.", "Because knowledge is dialogic, rooted in the \u201ckinetic melodies\u201d of a \u201cconversation\u201d we don\u2019t remember, our minds depend on other minds, and Hustvedt can take aim at the clich\u00e9 of the solitary philosopher: \u201cA man sits alone in a room and thinks,\u201d she observes. \u201cThis image remains central to the history of modern Western thought. How the man happened to find himself in that room is not often part of the picture.\u201d The novelist, by contrast, \u201cis in that room with others, not only the real people who have shaped her unconscious and conscious imagination, but also fictive people and the voices of hundreds of people now dead who left their words in the books she has read.\u201d The gender swap here is no accident: The same binary that privileges intellect over passion and spirit over substance also glorifies men at women\u2019s expense. Hustvedt sees patriarchal self-regard as stultifying, female receptivity as fertile and generous: \u201cWriting is always for someone,\u201d she reminds us.", "But it is hard to say who exactly this particular collection is for. As searching and seductive as the essays occasionally can be, they are also absolutely maddening. For someone convinced that the truth is not just apprehended by the intellect but also felt, remembered, and imagined, Hustvedt makes little effort to welcome readers with her prose. \u201cRather than charting correspondences between two distinct realms, psyche and soma, we can look for meanings in a lived body that is socio-psycho-biological, with each hyphenated segment mingled into the others, rather than neatly stratified,\u201d she writes. I can tell you what those words mean, but I don\u2019t know if I agree with them: They conjure no answering echo in my history or emotions, and I can\u2019t animate them with the deeper understanding Hustvedt celebrates.", "The thing is: It is also difficult to imagine experts finding her rehashings of other people\u2019s work particularly enlightening. I fear that either her editors stopped reading after a few hundred pages or didn\u2019t want to say anything about her twistier sentences because they anticipated being sneered at. Still, windiness I can forgive. Obscurity I can forgive. More off-putting is the author\u2019s preening self-regard. To read all 500 or so pages of this volume front to back is to be critically radicalized, such that mild marginalia in the first half intensifies into furious exclamation points and scribbled insults in the second half, and by Part III the reviewer is in a constant struggle to collect herself and appreciate the various smart points this extremely vexing person is making.", "Hustvedt will take every opportunity to congratulate herself on her cleverness, as when, searching for a personal example of how morality can\u2019t be easily reduced to mental processes, she describes eviscerating some poor speaker\u2019s \u201csimplistic\u201d paper at a conference. (\u201cI experienced mingled feelings of triumph and guilt,\u201d she recalls, \u201ctriumph because my barbs had been on point and guilt because I had clearly flustered and embarrassed the man.\u201d) I lost count of the number of times she quotes her own work, name-drops famous friends, relays compliments she\u2019s received, or draws our attention to the idiocy of some rival. Transported by her own intellectualizing of other humans, Hustvedt frequently loses sight of the humans themselves. Writing about a group of Cambodian women who went blind after seeing their families captured, she breathlessly suggests:", "These women are not metaphors, but Hustvedt casts them as little more than phantoms in her reverie. Likewise, there is a lot of performative contemplation here, during which the occasion for and specifics of the chin stroking seem to matter less than the fact that the author is stroking her chin. Take the essay \u201cMuch Ado About Hairdos.\u201d \u201cAll mammals have hair,\u201d Hustvedt begins in a characteristic rehearsal of the obvious, making a show of seeing the familiar anew. \u201cHair is not a body part so much as a lifeless extension of a body. Although the bulb of the follicle is alive, the hair shaft is dead and insensible.\u201d The piece vamps like this for a while, and then arrives at an insight: \u201cThe liminal status of hair is crucial to its meanings.\u201d And also: \u201cContiguity plays a role in hair\u2019s significance.\u201d I submit that these observations are interchangeable, that the point isn\u2019t", "weird shit Hustvedt has to say about hair but that she, with her uncommon penetration, is saying weird shit about hair. I believe she wants us to exclaim: \u201cWhat a gift to watch this supple intelligence apply itself to as quotidian a topic as hair!\u201d The most aggravating part is that \u201cMuch Ado About Hairdos\u201d makes some spellbinding moves. Hustvedt compares Rapunzel\u2019s long braid to an umbilical cord, and then to the string that mother and child play with during Freud\u2019s", ". But setting aside her alienating tone to appreciate such inspired leaps proved beyond my powers. I blame my relational mammalian reality.", "\"All mammals have hair.\" Nope. Dolphins are mammals and they don't have hair. I'm smarter than the author 'cause I've seen episodes of SeaQuest.
