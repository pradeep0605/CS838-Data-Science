So imagine my surprise this week to discover that in fact I had stolen that anecdote almost word-for-word from a Lorrie Moore short story called \u201cAgnes of Iowa.\u201d Not on purpose! I really thought that the story had been told to me by an old friend. And in a way, it was: Like most people I know who love Lorrie Moore stories, I view Moore herself, though we\u2019ve never met, as a wise, funny friend who\u2019s much smarter about human nature than I\u2019ll ever be.", "She\u2019s still smarter than me. But with", ", her new collection, she\u2019s a different, more difficult friend. For starters, she hasn\u2019t got the time or energy for me that she used to: This slim volume of eight stories is Moore\u2019s first collection in 16 years (though there was a novel,", ", in 2009).

The reader-friendly forms and transparent structure of her earlier stories has given way to denser, more adventurous storytelling. Where once her stories were light breezes\u2014albeit ones that would occasionally blow up into gales\u2014now they are complex weather systems: swirling, variable, dangerous, and difficult to anticipate more than 36 hours in advance.", "Consider \u201cPaper Losses,\u201d the most brutal of the stories in", ". If Moore had written this story in her 20s or 30s, the married couple heading for divorce, Kit and Rafe, might have presented their takes in competing narration or through a second-person instructional. We might have seen the characters share affection even as the marriage fell apart, and we might have felt, along with the characters, a kind of gentle sadness for the inevitable failure of these two humans to build a life together that could last. The story, no matter how dark, would have been threaded with bright spots: jokes, comic riffs, and, above all, memories of the deep affection Kit and Rafe shared.", "Not anymore. \u201cPaper Losses\u201d begins with the outright declaration that Kit and Rafe want to kill each other and gets grimmer from there:", "Unlike in previous Moore stories, these jokes neither set the story aloft nor leaven the story\u2019s sadness. These are grim jokes, dark as the grave, reflexive shrugs from a character who no longer sees the point. \u201cPeople will do anything, anything, for a really nice laugh,\u201d Moore wrote in one of her first stories. In", ", people who\u2019ve done anything, anything, now face the results.", "Rafe finally serves Kit with divorce papers, but the two still take a long-planned Caribbean vacation with their children. The trip is a hash, and the last half of the story is a master class at the ratcheting up of tension. Moore doesn\u2019t really write murder stories, the occasional corpse on a floor notwithstanding. But at times during \u201cPaper Losses,\u201d especially given its opening sentence, I felt certain that what I was reading was about to turn bloody and awful. It might have been a relief. Instead of a murder, though, the story dives ever so briefly into the second person, for a moment so messy that days later I can scarcely believe I read it:", "* * *", "Years ago, Moore told the", "that she has a \u201cwriter friend\u201d who leans over sleeping babies and intones, \u201cMay you never be reviewed by Michiko Kakutani.\u201d Moore\u2019s latest", ", and the review is deeply irritating. Kakutani declares the book \u201cdisappointing\u201d in her first sentence, then avoids reflecting at all on what it means to be disappointed by a book. And disappointment with a book is not an uncomplicated feeling! It\u2019s one that works at multiple layers: the layer at which you loved an author\u2019s previous work, so much so that when you laid hands on the new book you felt a little thrill that this treasure has appeared in your life. The layer at which you struggle to find in the book the things you loved before. The layer of disillusion, as you realize that something is missing: But is it missing in the book, or is it missing in you? The layer at which the flaws in this new book retroactively make you dislike previous books by the same writer. The layer of disappointment in yourself, for being so foolish as to desire a transcendent experience\u2014for being so foolish as once to have felt that, before you became old.

And when I read", ", my initial response was similar to what I infer Kakutani\u2019s to be: These stories failed me, at first, or I failed them, perhaps. For days I struggled with the book, dipping back in, rereading stories and talking about them with people I know who had read the book as well. Where was my disappointment coming from? What did I want out of a book, and a writer? What does a reader do when she realizes a favorite author has changed?", "Photo by Zane Williams", "It took me a long time to realize that was I was doing to myself was what Lorrie Moore does to her characters. In", ", Moore sits her protagonists down and interrogates their emotions, to the point, sometimes, of unpleasantness. Her language is penetrating and discomfiting, all the more so because her subject is, in many ways, the failure of language\u2014the inability of logorrheic modern men and women to find even in their torrent of words the right ones to address the pain roiling behind them. In \u201cReferential,\u201d the narrator\u2019s institutionalized son compulsively cuts himself, and the scars resemble \u201ccoarse campfire writing, as when young people used to stiffly carve the words PEACE and FUCK in park picnic tables and trees, the", "three-quarters of a square.
