In the second chapter, one of Ensler\u2019s doctors points to a CAT scan that clearly shows masses in her uterus, colon, and rectum, and also maybe a cyst in her liver.

And as we continue through the book, this eager confusion of the health of the body and the soul comes to seem part of a pattern. This is a book in which the most talented and generous doctors are \u201chandsome\u201d or \u201cvery beautiful\u201d or possess a beauty \u201cinseparable\u201d from kindness and devotion.", "The brief chapters, called \u201cscans,\u201d push through to Ensler\u2019s physical recuperation and spiritual renewal in blasts and flashes of a half-tranced consciousness. It\u2019s an organic approach, appropriate to the motions of an anxious mind hallucinating free-floating cancer cells, to the disorientations of post-op oxycodone and after-chemo pot, and (a metaphor common to illness narratives) to the sense of dislocation particular to the very sick\u2014the sense of being permanently jet-lagged in a foreign country.", "\u201cIllness does not proceed by design,\u201d Kat Duff writes in", ": \u201cDefying the rules of ordinary reality, illness shares in the hidden logic of dreams, fairy tales, and the spirit realms mystics and shamans describe.\u201d During Ensler\u2019s months of magical thinking, she pulled many rabbits out of many nurse\u2019s caps, but instead of retrospectively evaluating her protective delusions and existential fantasies, she tends to let the unreality linger. After the surgeons have sliced through her navel, \u201cthe only evidence I was once connected to my mother,\u201d she tells the reader that her mother got very sick just afterward. The possibility\u2014the probability!\u2014of coincidence goes unacknowledged.", "In that silence, the mythic approach to self that Ensler began retailing in her incantatory opening chapter grows deeper roots. Revealing her youthful traumas\u2014her father\u2019s horrible abuse, her mother\u2019s alienating coldness, her promiscuous drug use as a high school student in Scarsdale, N.Y., her drunken promiscuity as an undergraduate at Middlebury\u2014Ensler reads her life through the disease. Her cancer is a test and a purgation\u2014a phase of her heroine\u2019s journey toward self-actualization. She ardently conflates her experience of it with the horrors of the Congo, \u201cwhere in one breath the most grotesque acts of evil were countered with the deepest kindness.\u201d", "Ensler is not devoid of mordantly amusing self-awareness. In a chapter titled \u201cHow\u2019d I Get It?\u201d the author unreels a highly personal\u2014and therefore beautifully universal\u2014list of questions to herself about the causes of her disease. Was it her walls or her boundaries? Was it the tofu or the Froot Loops? \u201cWas it bad reviews? Or good reviews? Was it being reviewed?\u201d But this glimmer of self-deflation is just that, a glimmer, faint and unsteady. Mostly what you get is Ensler\u2019s friend Sue giving a pre-chemo pep talk: \u201cThe chemo \u2026 is for all the past crimes, it\u2019s for your father, it\u2019s for the rapists, it\u2019s for perpetrators.\u201d Mostly what you get is \u201calmost everyone\u201d telling Ensler that the disease afflicting her reproductive organs has a supernatural dimension. It\u2019s \u201cCongo Stigmata\u201d: \u201cCells of endometrial (uterine) cancer had created a tumor between the vagina and the bowel and had \u2018fistulated\u2019 the rectum. Essentially, the cancer had done exactly what rape had done to so many thousands of women in the Congo. I ended up having the same surgery as many of them.\u201d \u201cDr. Handsome\u201d declares that the findings are \u201cspiritual.\u201d What you get, ultimately, is inspirational literature: Ensler in Africa finding \u201ca second wind\u201d and embracing \u201ca second life\u201d and accepting it as her destiny to \u201cbirth the new paradigm\u201d of global socioeconomics: \u201cWe are the people of the second wind. \u2026 Be part of this collection of molecules that begins somewhere unknown and can\u2019t help but keep rising.
