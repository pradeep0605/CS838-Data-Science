{"Body": ["Illustration by Sam Alden", "Twenty-four pages into Jess Row\u2019s debut novel", ", the narrator, Kelly Thorndike, catches sight of his reflection in a storefront window, and pauses to remark upon this face of his as it presently appears to him. It is \u201can ordinary face, I guess you could say, relatively dark-featured, with a close-trimmed beard and thick eyebrows, the gift of my Portuguese great-grandparents. An unremarkable, unhandsome, inoffensive face. A white face. I should add that now.\u201d It\u2019s a strangely disorienting moment, in that it draws attention to how rarely this specific detail\u2014the whiteness of a character\u2019s skin, in a work of fiction by a white writer\u2014is ever remarked upon. Whiteness, it is implied, has no meaningful content; a white face is just a face, unremarkable and unmarked by the conditions of race.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "It\u2019s this unremarkableness that Row wants us to start seeing as remarkable, as worth engaging with. In", "he published last year in the", ", he addressed what he referred to as the \u201cderacination\u201d of fiction over the last 30 years by white American writers, a category to which he himself belongs. He\u2019s interested mostly in the kind of writing that tends to get called \u201crealist,\u201d and which tends to get taught, and reproduced, in creative writing workshops. He\u2019s talking about writers like John Cheever, Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff\u2014writers, all of them, with ordinary and unremarkable faces. Most specifically, he\u2019s talking about Richard Ford, whose prose he describes as one \u201cof ownership, of confidence in its own ontological condition,\u201d reflecting \u201can unquestionable self-assurance that in our culture and era only white males can have.\u201d Ford, in other words, is the white guy", "of contemporary American letters.", "He refers to an", "in 1999, in which he made the following claim: \u201c\u2018White\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 are not really races to me, and I have no wish to make them be, or to make being white a consideration in knowing me. And so I don\u2019t completely understand why black politics, black culture, black literature, black identity are still so widely sanctified and haven\u2019t become pass\u00e9 in the view of most intelligent people.\u201d When I read this, I immediately thought of Percival Everett, whose ingenious novel", "lays out the kind of thing that happens when a writer who has no wish to make his race a consideration in knowing him happens to not be white. Everett\u2019s narrator Thelonious Ellison is, like Everett himself, a black novelist who writes playfully highbrow books, heavily informed by poststructuralist critical theory. One of these books is taken to task by a reviewer in the following sublimely idiotic fashion: \u201cThe novel is finely crafted, with fully developed characters, rich language and subtle play with the plot, but one is lost to understand what this reworking of Aeschylus\u2019", "has to do with the African American experience.\u201d There\u2019s a flip side, Everett is noting, to the racial dynamic that allows Richard Ford to consider his own whiteness an irrelevance: the implied expectation that black writers will always act as cultural envoys of blackness.", "In", "Row is going for a similar sort of script flipping. The novel\u2019s setup is, in itself, a direct narrative provocation, a willfully grotesque premise that is both openly confrontational and yet strangely resistant to straightforward interpretation. Kelly Thorndike has moved back from Massachusetts to his hometown of Baltimore, still grieving the recent loss of his Chinese wife and their daughter in a car accident. On the novel\u2019s opening page, he is walking back from the grocery store when he crosses paths with a black man he has never seen before, and yet who strikes him as unaccountably familiar. \u201cI\u2019m looking into the face of a black man,\u201d he tells us, in the immediate present tense that is the novel\u2019s dominant narrative mode, \u201cand I\u2019ll be utterly honest, unsurprisingly honest: I don\u2019t know so many black men well enough that I would feel such a strong pull, such a decisive certainty. I", "this guy, I\u2019m thinking, yet I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve never seen this face before.\u201d When the stranger addresses Kelly by name, he immediately realizes who it is that is standing in front of him. It\u2019s Martin Lipkin, one of his closest friends from school\u2014who was, the last time our narrator encountered him, 19, and Jewish, and unambiguously white.", "The brilliance of the novel\u2019s central idea is in its combination of Swiftian grotesquery and creepy plausibility.", "Courtesy of a cutting-edge but fundamentally dodgy-sounding Bangkok clinic, Lipkin has undergone a series of procedures known as \u201cracial reassignment surgery.\u201d His original identity is now entirely obliterated, and he has been living for some years as Martin Wilkinson, a successful black entrepreneur, married to a black doctor who knows nothing of his past, with whom he has two black children. (These children are adopted. As sophisticated as Row makes it sound, the racial reassignment procedure is basically just cosmetic; there\u2019s no actual tinkering with the genetic source code going on here.) Two questions immediately arise: Why would Martin risk blowing his cover in order to announce himself to a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in 20 years? And why has he gone and transformed himself into a black man in the first place?", "The former question is answered more or less straight away: Lipkin wants Kelly to provide a full Boswell service\u2014to write a book about him and his life, and about the as-yet unpublicized procedure. He wants him, in other words, to assist him in revealing himself in a controlled and public fashion. The latter question takes at least the remaining 369 pages of the book. I say \u201cat least\u201d because although a great deal of explaining gets done\u2014a great deal of backstory and a great deal of talking\u2014nothing like an unambiguous explanation ever really emerges.", "That backstory is concerned, largely, with Kelly and Martin\u2019s friendship as teenagers, during which time they played in a moderately successful art-punk trio called L\u2019Arc en Ciel. (It may or may not be a sly meta-jape on Row\u2019s part, what with his book\u2019s thematic concern with masks and doubles and cultural appropriation, to have given the band the same name as", "The L\u2019Arc en Ciel in the book is heavily informed by American post-hardcore acts like the Jesus Lizard and Fugazi.) The circumstances surrounding the death by drug overdose of the band\u2019s waywardly talented guitarist Alan are what lead to the dissolution of Kelly and Martin\u2019s friendship\u2014as well as, in a much vaguer sense, Martin\u2019s subsequent disappearance and racial switcheroo.", "Row is reckoning with unwieldy and difficult themes here, and his approach to them is both disarmingly direct (occasionally to the point of didacticism) and strangely oblique. He\u2019s self-consciously drawing on a polemical tradition in American art\u2014in literature, music, and film that addresses the complexities and conflicts of race. (In the acknowledgements, he thanks Spike Lee for", "David Simon and others for", "as well as James Baldwin \u201cfor his words to white Americans, in anger and love", ")", "The book is jagged with references to significant cultural touchstones. \u201cMy education in blackness,\u201d Kelly says, \u201cin the experience of black people in America, began one hot summer afternoon in 1989, in sticky-floored Theater C at the Chestnut Hill Mall 13, with Spike Lee\u2019s", "\u201d\u2014and thereby Public Enemy. In college, an acquaintance ridicules his heavily rap-based music collection (\u201cWho are you supposed to be, homeboy?\u201d), and he promptly reinvents himself along more stereotypically white cultural lines. He dumps all his cassettes in a box and shifts allegiances\u2014to Pavement, Stereolab, John Ashbery, expensive coffee\u2014as though switching cellphone providers for a package that better suits his needs. \u201cI tore my", "poster off my bedroom wall,\u201d he tells us, \u201cand used the back for calligraphy practice.\u201d\u00a0 The book is bluntly insistent about its equation of identification with identity, but this seems an unaccountably hysterical reversal of cultural affinity. (And neither does it quite fit the profile of a kid who plays drums in a post-punk band, and is presumably well versed in the back catalogue of Dischord Records.)", "There are quite a few of these kinds of moments in the book, where you\u2019re left wondering about a character\u2019s motivations for some or other drastic action. And the central drastic action here, obviously, is Martin\u2019s racial reassignment surgery. It\u2019s a deeply uncomfortable idea, not just because it immediately hits you on a visceral level as a grotesque", "of the logic of cultural appropriation, as a kind of holistic minstrel routine. Row also seems to want his invented procedure to demand consideration alongside gender reassignment surgery, and within the broader postmodern context of the fluidity of identity and selfhood.", "Photo by Sarah Shatz", "The linguistic frame around the procedure is such that this comparison basically can\u2019t be avoided; the condition Martin claims to be suffering from\u2014or rather to have found a cure for\u2014is called \u201cRacial Dysphoria,\u201d which clearly invokes the recognized condition of gender dysphoria. The book presents the liberal reader, in this sense, with a political double bind, whereby if you accept the idea that a person can be born with the \u201cwrong\u201d gender, then you have to at least entertain the idea that a person might equally be born with the \u201cwrong\u201d race, which deposits you straight into some very murky political waters. But Row is as interested in the cultural economics of consumer choice as he is in the politics of identity. Here\u2019s how one character, a Korean academic named Julie-san who is undergoing surgery to make herself appear western, puts it: \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t biological. I wasn\u2019t", ". Whatever that means. Will I survive how I am? Of course. But why settle for survival? We\u2019re talking about choice. Conscious, adult, rational choice.\u201d", "The brilliance of the novel\u2019s central idea is in its combination of Swiftian grotesquery and creepy plausibility. There\u2019s no real qualitative difference, that is, between the procedure at the center of", "and procedures that people,", "(", ")", ", are already undergoing. Why", "people get surgery to \u201cbecome\u201d black, if such a thing were possible? (Because it\u2019s an utterly abhorrent idea? Yeah, sure, like that\u2019s ever stopped people doing anything.) A little later, Julie-san frames racial reassignment as the next phase of a rapidly metastasizing consumer culture:", "These are interesting ideas, but Row never quite succeeds in making the novel as provocative as its premise. Largely, this is because he doesn\u2019t deliver a convincing psychological account of why Martin would want to do what he has done. He\u2019s an extremely smart man\u2014calculatedly rational and (given the extremity of his life choices) nowhere near as eccentric as you\u2019d expect him to be. We are provided with a lot of background detail on his early life, which is interesting on its own terms and largely justified by the plot device of Kelly\u2019s writing a book about him. (The public front for this is that Kelly is researching a piece for", "about black entrepreneurs in Baltimore, focusing on Martin and his \u201cgrey market\u201d technology firm\u2014which black-and-white metaphor clearly reflects Row\u2019s larger themes.

He went to school in a black neighborhood of Baltimore, and had various black surrogate parental figures. Later, after the death of Alan and of his friendship with Kelly, there is an extended and financially productive interlude in the drug underworld, which leads to a criminal conviction.", "The conceit of the biographer/subject relationship forms the novel\u2019s organizing narrative principle, in such a way that the story\u2019s subtexts are always being brought to the surface in the form of spoken exchanges between Row\u2019s characters. This sometimes recalls Dostoevsky, in the sense that a book like", "presents a kind of moral dialectic, a set of ideas embodied and advanced by its characters.", "is similarly talky; Row\u2019s formal decision to withhold quotation marks, or any other textual framing of direct speech, has the effect of elevating the dialogue to a status equal to that of the rest of the prose. But with the characters doing so much of the heavy thematic lifting in their spoken exchanges, the novel can sometimes feel like the transcript of a symposium on its own themes, in which Row\u2019s intellectual concerns are somehow both overexposed and underexplored. And so an intellectual figure like Julie-san, say, with her cultural studies rationale for her own bizarre choices, seems like an unsubtle envoy of a particular position\u2014less a person than a discursive device.", "Late in the book, Kelly is at a party with Martin and his wife, and he sees a little girl who reminds him of his own lost daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s half,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cI can see that in a second, all Chinese features around the eyes and the mouth, but with an extra broadness in the nose and warm peach tones in her skin.\u201d The girl asks him to take a photo of her with her parents, which he does; after the little girl and her father have left the room, he turns to the mother, who is Chinese, and says of his own daughter, \u201c", ".\u201d And then we get this reflection on the ambiguity of tenses in Chinese:", "In the context of a book I often found frustrating for its combination of didacticism and evasiveness, I was taken aback by this moving passage, with its delicate explication of the ways in which language can simultaneously reveal and elide painful truths. It resonated in its quiet way throughout the home stretch of the", ", and it called attention to qualities otherwise largely absent in the writing. The moment was both emotionally direct and intellectually delicate, that is, and it seemed to speak directly from a core of loss and confusion at the center of a real and autonomous character. A character who seemed fully present, and present in service of something more than an artful conceit.
