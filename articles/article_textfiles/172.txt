That\u2019s the moment, Bai argues, that the presidential-campaign\u00a0train skipped the tracks and whistled into the ravine. From that time on, only a new breed of craven politician could survive a press gauntlet that had become focused on entertainment rather than issues.", "In the spring of \u201987, Hart, the two-term senator from Colorado, was considered a favorite for the Democratic nomination. But in early May, the", "reported that he had been spending time with Donna Rice, a 29-year-old actress and model who wasn\u2019t his wife. The news seemed to corroborate longstanding rumors about Hart\u2019s extra-marital affairs. A five-day media feeding frenzy followed, including a press conference where Hart was asked if he had committed adultery. Hart then learned\u00a0that the", "was preparing a story about his affair with a lobbyist, and he withdrew from the race.

During the last campaign, I made", "to explain how our presidential campaigns had gone off track and offered a theory about what the press, the voters, and the candidates could do to improve the conversation.", "But Bai doesn\u2019t just make an argument: He tells the juicy Hart story all over again, right down to the oil-stained alley in which reporters cornered the candidate and interrogated him about the blonde in his apartment. It\u2019s a story he tells well, with lots of patient, rich reporting and real sympathy for its main character. And watching the author try to wrestle with what\u2019s in bounds and what\u2019s out of bounds echoes what reporters were trying to do at the time.", "Bai\u2019s central claim is that the reporters covering Hart got the balance way out of whack. The alley where they cornered him after staking out his apartment to see if Rice spent the night is ground zero. The press no longer covered issues but became more interested in tabloid pursuits. Individual reporters wanted to become the next Woodward or Bernstein. They justified the whole business by claiming they were looking into \u201ccharacter,\u201d an arrogant pursuit that put the press in the role of scold and moral judge. According to Bai, the \u201cvery purpose of political journalism\u201d was \u201credefined.\u201d And it was a point of no return.", "Campaigns have always narrowed complex people down to little moments.", "But Bai\u2019s thesis downplays a less venal explanation for what drove reporters overboard: They thought they were doing their job.", "Character was a big issue in the \u201987 race because a combination of history and Democrats\u2014including Hart himself\u2014had made it one. Presidents of both parties had lied about Vietnam. Nixon\u2019s lies about Watergate had gotten him kicked out of office. \u201cIn 1972 the American people had their worst fears confirmed about the lengths to which corrupt men will go to preserver power,\u201d Hart wrote in", ", his book about that year\u2019s presidential race.\u00a0Saving the country from such corrupt men became a key topic of political debates and a key Democratic Party talking point.\u00a0That\u2019s why Jimmy Carter\u2019s 1976 campaign pledge, \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you,\u201d worked. In 1984, Mondale had used vague character claims in his race against Hart in the\u00a0 presidential race, and in 1987, the issue of honesty was on the table again, as voters wondered whether Reagan had lied about the arms-for-hostages swap that became known as the Iran Contra affair.", "Voters couldn\u2019t just take a politician\u2019s word for it or pore over his white papers. They needed to examine his character. Nixon had campaigned on getting", "of Vietnam, after all.", "The precedent for the personal becoming political was one with which Hart was familiar. He had been George McGovern\u2019s campaign manager. He had watched the campaign crumble after reports emerged that McGovern\u2019s running mate, Thomas Eagleton, had been hospitalized for mental health treatment. Hart\u2019s account of the flap in", "often sounds like Bai\u2019s description of what happened to Hart himself 15 years later. The Eagleton story\u00a0started with an anonymous tip, as the Hart story did. It became, as Hart describes it, \u201cthe hottest news story in years.\u201d As the campaign scrambled to find answers, Hart says \u201cthis had never happened before; no one knew the rules.\u201d But that\u2019s not exactly true: The Eagleton flap echoes what George Romney went through in \u201967 after saying that he had been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d about Vietnam. Eagleton lashed out at the press, as Hart would later do. But ultimately he resigned. In Hart\u2019s view, the episode destroyed McGovern\u2019s chance at the presidency. It makes no sense that a presidential candidate should be written off after such an episode. But those were the blunt rules of the politics of the personal.", "Campaigns have always narrowed complex people down to little moments. That happens, in part, because\u00a0voters key in on the kind of personal details that are the most immediately familiar to them.\u00a0In retrospect, some of the critical turning points in campaigns seem ridiculous. Was Muskie really hurt in New Hampshire because he seemed to cry? Did Nixon really save his reputation in 1952 by talking about his wife\u2019s cloth coat? Did Ford really lose the Texas primary to Reagan because he ate a tamale with the husk still on? Carter admitted that he \u201clusted in his heart\u201d in 1976, but that couldn\u2019t possibly have been important to anyone.", "The chance for a personal trait to define a candidate beyond all reason was well in place before Hart\u2019s troubles.\u00a0Indeed, the lingering fallout from Ted Kennedy\u2019s 1969 car accident at Chappaquiddick, which killed his date Mary Jo Kopechne, was one of the reasons Kennedy did not run\u2014and that Hart was thus a frontrunner\u2014in 1987.", "What changed in Hart\u2019s case was that the hunt into the personal started to include investigations into sexual indiscretions\u2014and that such hunts now included staking out the candidate in his apartment. Wilbur Mills\u2019 affair with a stripper had ended his career in 1974, but that was because a drunken Mills had crashed his car into the Tidal Basin, not because the press had set up a sobriety test.", "Still, in the Hart episode, reporters went a little further down a well-worn road\u2014they didn\u2019t blaze a new trail. And how exactly the press went as far as it did is complex in other ways. Hart famously said, \u201cFollow me around. I don\u2019t care. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They\u2019d be very bored.\u201d As Bai notes, that quote came out at the same time as the", "story about Rice, so no journalist could claim they were simply taking up the candidate on his challenge. Still, Hart had been telling reporters on and off the record for months that there was nothing to sordid claims about his past. When there was suddenly evidence he was fooling around in real time, it\u2019s likely that reporters felt duped and let him have it in extra measure as retribution for trying to hoodwink them.", "It\u2019s possible, then, that the media\u2019s failure in the Hart matter was like Hart\u2019s admitted adultery: a regrettable episode of excess for which some context is required before making a sweeping judgment\u2014especially since, unlike Hart, the press was motivated at least in some fashion by a sense of duty. The", "\u2019s Tom Fiedler, who broke the Hart story, doesn\u2019t come off well in Bai\u2019s book. But a week before Fiedler got the anonymous tip about Rice, he", ". That piece suggests he wasn\u2019t racing to examine personal character, or he was at least conflicted about doing so.", "If Bai\u2019s thesis were true\u2014if all the rules of political journalism were changed and privacy obliterated by a new and impossibly narrow definition of character\u2014we\u2019d expect every candidate to be forced to answer the Kinsey survey. But, in part because the press realized that it had gone too far in the Hart and Clinton years, plenty of stories in the years since that should have had tabloid appeal didn\u2019t cause feeding frenzies.\u00a0The rethinking started almost immediately. The", "never ran the story about Hart\u2019s relationship with the lobbyist even though he re-joined the presidential race several months after he dropped out.", "The governor of New York got damning coverage when he was linked to a prostitution ring\u2014but the reporters weren\u2019t in the alley, the FBI was. Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, and John McCain were all admitted adulterers when they ran for president.\u00a0They weren\u2019t pressed terribly hard during their campaigns about what that said about their character. What little coverage there was of their romantic lives came and went quickly without any satellite trucks on their lawns. Erik Wemple", "how news organizations chose not to dig into allegations about Bob Dole\u2019s private life. Reporters covering Gingrich knew he was having an affair while pushing for Clinton\u2019s\u00a0impeachment\u2014and they didn\u2019t write about it.\u00a0Some reporters say they knew about John Edwards\u2019 affair while it was going on. It didn\u2019t come to light until afterward.", "Courtesy of Robyn Twomey", "That\u2019s not to say the press hasn\u2019t noticeably mutated, but it\u2019s for other reasons. The mutations\u2014the rise of 24-hour cable news, social media, and hyper-partisanship\u2014weren\u2019t really a factor in Hart\u2019s case. Cable news, which really blossomed after Hart, thrives by keeping viewers on the boil, arguing over the latest controversy or buzzy development. There\u2019s plenty to cover because partisans are in a state of perpetual outrage whether there is good reason to be or not. The fight is the thing and everything is a fight. Unlike in \u201987, there\u2019s not even a flawed journalistic precept to justify a lot of current coverage\u2014anything related to Donald Trump, for example.

And these are just the post-Hart changes in the press. Other big changes in the system that give us our current disappointments include everything from the rise of campaign strategists to the flood of special-interest money.", "Since Hart\u2019s fall, Bai writes,\u00a0\u201cthe measure of a leader became his hunger for the game, his talent for dazzling crowds.\u201d Americans, says Bai, have come \u201cto confuse actual leadership with the capacity to endure and entertain.\u201d\u00a0Such confusion does occur, but it has been occurring for quite some time. It\u2019s been that way by increasing degrees since it became accepted for candidates to campaign for themselves. That was a century ago. H.L. Mencken made a career out of lampooning politicians who only played to the crowd. He died three decades before anyone had heard of Donna Rice.", "Presidential campaigns have always been as much or more about who a candidate is than what they say, but it\u2019s a tricky thing to evaluate a presidential candidate, because successful presidential characteristics always have a negative side lingering nearby. Self-confidence can become hubris, focus can become insularity. Almost all great presidents were complex and contained traits that would disqualify them in today\u2019s frantic world. Lincoln had severe bouts of crippling depression. FDR lied often and was a needy adulterer. George Washington could be an unhinged", ". Oh, and Richard Nixon had a clean private life. Bai\u2019s important call for perspective is a reminder to all of us in the press and the electorate to recognize the complexity of the human condition, whether we\u2019re casting aside candidates because they wear a funny helmet in a tank or because they once committed adultery.
