Wilson, at least initially, believed in the Soviet regime, but Nabokov, who blamed the Bolsheviks for his father\u2019s death (and had been set to inherit from his uncle an estate worth more than $100 million in today\u2019s dollars), detested it. Yet this seemingly foundational difference was not what drove a wedge between them.", "Instead, Wilson and Nabokov clashed over a gerund.

Again and again, Beam describes the critic skipping out onto a limb that had broken under him multiple times in the past. Nabokov, on the other hand, was essentially mean as a snake. He might have been the superior writer to Wilson in many respects (although I, for one, remain an ardent admirer of Wilson\u2019s criticism), but Wilson once nailed him as neatly as Nabokov pinned the butterflies that he collected: \u201cThere is also something about him rather nasty,\u201d Wilson wrote, \u201c\u2014the cruelty of the arrogant rich man\u2014that makes him want to humiliate others.\u201d This malicious streak, abundantly evidenced in the pages of", "took the form of supercilious insults directed at Nabokov\u2019s literary rivals (not that he would have admitted to seeing them as such).

Assorted third parties got drawn onto the battlefield, including a Harvard professor Beam describes as \u201ca personage of almost Gogolian gravamen,\u201d Alexander Gerschenkron, to whom even Nabokov didn\u2019t have the audacity to reply. (Also, Gerschenkron\u2019s criticisms were unimpeachable\u2014in the book\u2019s second edition, Nabokov quietly corrected the errors he pointed out.)
