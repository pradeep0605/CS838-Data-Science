Though seriously starched, Bell Labs\u2014the research octopus of AT&T\u2014had some oddballs walking, and in one case unicycling, its endless corridors. Satellite inventor John Pierce once strolled into a mathematician\u2019s office and shut himself inside a locker, as if grabbing a moment of empathetic darkness for all the nerds who would be involuntarily stuffed into future lockers before growing up to invent things both great and terrible. He freed himself and left the room without a word, hanging a big fat", "on his colleague\u2019s face.", "There were others. Radar man Jim Fisk\u2014who once said his senses were sharpened by \u201cman-eating flies\u201d\u2014was pretty good at vanishing down nonexistent stairs, an illusion", ".

At Bell Labs, a sense of humor, not to mention patience, was required during a period that Shockley described as \u201cthe natural blundering process of finding one\u2019s way.\u201d The path to lasers, radars, satellites, and decent phone service was full of all manner of unplanned genius and gee-whiz. Bell Labs had to keep \u201cinventing ways to invent those things,\u201d writes Gertner, also a science writer for the", ".", "Before the first 80-pound mobile phone, there was a robot finger to simulate dialing and a Dropping Machine to gauge \u201cthe violence of impact\u201d when", ". A Flintstonian Woodpecker Machine was created to test the resistance of wood finish on telephone poles. Noise was an invasive species in the Bell System. The company diligently gopher-proofed its underground cables and filtered out the ancillary racket that infested conversation, sound effects that did little in discouraging the notion that long distance calls were routed through outer space. A thing to come later, anyway.", "In 1921, the federal government exempted AT&T from antitrust regulations, allowing Bell Labs to pursue\u2014", "\u2014a \u201cmission to connect all of us, and all of our new machines, together.\u201d (At the time, Russia seemed to take this mission a lockstep further, establishing the Central Institute of Labor laboratory, \u201cmachine-human complexes,\u201d as descriptions of the era put it, for bioengineering the \u201cperfect electric man.\u201d) With dibs on the latest innovations, both military and civilian, the feds were wise to grant AT&T, and by dint Bell Labs and its manufacturing division, Western Electric, this elastic courtesy. By 1941, when Bell Labs president O.E. Buckley was heading the National Defense Research Committee, the lab itself had relocated from Manhattan to an expanded facility in Murray Hill, N.J.. The windows were painted black, barbed wire curled inward, and nearly 75 percent of research went to the war machine.", "rightly concentrates on Jim Fisk\u2019s radar research as one of Bell Labs\u2019 most important wartime contributions, instead of, say, Jim Fisk\u2019s proposal to install a swimming pool in the basement of a biscuit factory to study the \u201cpropulsion system of sharks\u201d for naval warfare.

Bell Labs busied itself with bazookas, magnetic mines, a camera that photographed bullets, and my favorite, the Water Heater. This acoustic torpedo was equipped with a 500-watt speaker that popped out of its nose and played \u201ctactical sounds\u201d to decoy enemy ships, and then, like all the rest, self-destructed.", "I learned about the Water Heater from", ", a Bell Labs crypto-engineer who successfully arrived at his 105", "birthday this month.

Even more hushed was the Bell Labs collusion with Muzak, Inc., the waiting room god of mindless symphony. Muzak helped produce randomized thermal noise records for a top-secret phone scrambler called SIGSALY, or Project X.

In the interest of transparency\u2014in the Bell Labs, the \u201crealm of opaque chatter\u201d\u2014my acoustic bias toward West Street\u2019s military affairs can be traced to a book I wrote on the vocoder.

Apparently, the two smartest guys in the room were busy figuring out how to make machines think, while everyone else at lunch wondered what was going on in their heads.", "Shannon\u2019s wry sense of humor was manifested in his life and work. He \u201cwooed\u201d his wife Betty in the Differential Analyzer room and designed a Roman numeral calculator called the THROBAC. His chess-playing computer would talk trash, belittling opponent\u2019s moves.
