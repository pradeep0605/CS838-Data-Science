{"Body": ["John Martz", "In 2014, Stephen Colbert", "to Comic-Con dressed as a character from \u201cHawkcat, the most popular human-animal franchise ever published in Esperanto.\u201d The joke played off the ridiculousness of superhero movies, but it also played off the obscurity of Esperanto, a language invented by utopian ophthalmologist Ludovic \u00a0Lazarus Zamenhof, who died in Warsaw, Poland, nearly 100 years ago. Zamenhof intended his language, which he originally named the Lingwe Universalia, to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between nations and ethnicities, fusing populations as divided as the Jews, Russians, Germans, and Poles in the town of his youth. Clearly, his experiment was a massive failure on its own terms. It did not prevent a century of wars (many fought, notably, between people who spoke the same language). Instead, Esperanto\u2019s speakers were persecuted throughout the 20", "century, including Zamenhof\u2019s own children, all three of whom died in the Holocaust. Today, the community\u2019s estimated 1 million to 2 million members are mocked\u2014with some reason!\u2014as goofy cranks, up there with stamp-collectors in the pantheon of nerdy joiners.", "And yet, as Princeton literature professor Esther Schor shows in her combined history of the language and memoir of her seven-year encounter with it,", ", the success of Esperanto might be measured less in what it did for humanity at large and more in what it did, and continues to do, for its speakers, including Schor herself. Esperanto may not have changed the world. But in both its ideals and its practice, it holds out the possibility of transforming the lives of the people who use it.", "Schor\u2019s book alternates evenly between a history of the language and her own personal history, as she attends Esperanto conferences and moves deeper into an understanding of the language and its speakers. And although she is undeniably a powerful and scrupulously thoughtful writer both of intellectual and private history, the balance ends up feeling like an unfortunate choice.", "Isometric Studio", "The sections in the past are for the most part much more interesting than those in the present. Esperanto came out of the idealistic late 19", "century, from a thinker who had previously been attached to another utopian concept of this time\u2014Zionism. Zamenhof, born in 1859, was originally a nationalist who argued that Jews should create a settlement in America. But, frustrated with nascent state-building efforts in Palestine, he began envisioning a larger project that would protect Jews from violence by joining all people together under the beacon of a new neutral language. Publishing his first description of Esperanto in 1887, Zamenhof argued that Jews should adopt a set of humanistic cultural beliefs he dubbed \u201cHillelism\u201d after the first-century B.C. Rabbi Hillel (he later changed the name to Homaranismo).", "These ideals would replace the seemingly outmoded religious traditions that, in his mind, kept the Jews subservient to Russian mainstream culture. Zamenhof hoped an invented tongue\u2014one \u201cunlimitedly rich, flexible, full of every \u2018bagatelle\u2019 which gives life to language, beautiful-sounding, and extraordinarily easy\u201d\u2014would connect Jews to the rest of humanity.", "It\u2019s perhaps not surprising, given this ambitious and complicated mission, that Zamenhof ran into trouble nearly right off the bat. French intellectuals loved Esperanto\u2014but anti-Semitism was ferocious in the post-Dreyfus era, and when Zamenhof staged a conference in Boulogne, France, in 1906, his local fans concealed his Jewishness from the press. Zamenhof tussled with many of the popularizers of Esperanto, who downplayed the nonlinguistic aspects of his program or made language reforms that he deemed unnecessary. And yet, uncharacteristically for founders of a new nation, linguistic or otherwise, Zamenhof was intent on allowing speakers of Esperanto to make their own choices about what the language should mean, as well as how it should be used: \u201cI am leaving each person to clarify for himself the essence of the idea [of Esperanto], as he wishes,\u201d he said in a 1907 speech.", "Schor argues for the \u201cheroism\u201d of this decision, and this seems right. Zamenhof wasn\u2019t just performing a George Washington\u2013style abdication of power; he was also allowing the language to evolve much like a living language. Esperantists have remarkable control over how they speak the tongue, and\u2014at least according to Schor\u2019s book\u2014spend a lot of time arguing over the many different ways of saying things like \u201ccluster bomb\u201d or \u201cmake-up artist.\u201d Speakers of Esperanto have also had tremendous freedom to promote a wide range of causes, from Marxism to civil rights to feminism to Baha\u2019i to Chinese Communism. Esperanto\u2019s ability to contain such ideological multitudes partially accounts for the suspicion with which repressive governments have long viewed it. Under Stalin, Esperanto speakers\u2014who had originally been supported by the Soviets \u2014were purged and sent to the gulag as spies. The Nazis attacked Esperanto groups in Germany and banned it outright in 1940, viewing the language as a Trojan horse for sinister Jewish and Bolshevik interests.", "Zamenhof was intent on allowing speakers of Esperanto to make their own choices about what the language should mean.", "During the Cold War, Esperanto was still viewed as a potential threat by many right-wing governments and in the McCarthy-era United States. The U.S. Army assigned the language and Esperanto symbols to a punching-bag enemy called \u201cAggressor\u201d in training exercises and PR films. Under attack, membership dwindling, the Esperanto movement struggled with a number of existential questions, not all of which have been resolved today. Was Zamenhof\u2019s original goal of universality still relevant, when English had emerged as the semiofficial language of international government and commerce? Could Esperanto speakers come up with different\u2014perhaps more amusing\u2014goals? What was the ideology of Esperanto, anyway: anti-fascism, neutrality, women\u2019s rights? Was the point really about ideology at all or just about people from around the world joining to speak a neutral language together? Manifestos were written, attacked, discarded. Songs and poems were composed in Esperanto restating the movement\u2019s basic, and rather vague, principles (likely to go well with a three-chord guitar progression): fraternity among nations, free movement of knowledge and people, universal connectedness, etc.", "Esperanto today, after many years of stumbling through the forest, has mostly found its purpose as an international Eurail pass for adventurous and slightly kooky multilinguists. In 1966, Argentine Esperantist Rub\u00e9n Feldman Gonz\u00e1lez founded what\u2019s now Pasporta Servo, a free, Esperanto-speaking Airbnb with more than 1,000 hosts across 90 countries, including Pakistan, Iran, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The internet has also opened up immense new opportunities for would-be Esperantists. Now anyone can take Esperanto classes at", "or on Duolingo; search in Google Esperanto or at Vikipedio; or email Pasporta Servo hosts to set up instant, free international lodging. For many of the Esperanto speakers Schor interviews, the opportunity to connect with people anywhere, in a neutral language (i.e., specifically not English, with its colonial baggage), is enough enticement to learn the tongue. Others are more passionate believers in the ideology, however they define that, including a 26-year-old Israeli who\u2019s probably one of the world\u2019s few remaining believers in the \u201cfina venko,\u201d Zamenhof\u2019s phrase for the \u201cfinal victory\u201d when the Babel world in collapse at last turns to its Esperanto grammar books.", "You should have posted this article translated into Esperanto at the bottom of the page.", "", "", "", "", "Schor herself has complex goals, and her book\u2014as ambitious, soulful, intellectually hefty, and yet occasionally na\u00efve as the project it describes\u2014sometimes gets tangled in them. This is true in some of the long sections at Esperanto conferences and workshops, in which she tends to allow her characters (Vietnamese English teachers, Cuban amateur erotic film-makers) to run off with the book in extended conversations about the fate of Esperanto or email exchanges reprinted in their entirety. She ends with a sojourn at Bona Espero, a school for farm children in rural Brazil run by two rugged Esperantists from Germany and Italy.", "Ruminating on the recent breakup of her 30-year marriage, Schor flirts with the studly Argentine music teacher, receives some wisdom from the school\u2019s guiding spirit, and interacts with the schoolchildren, in whose traumatized state she sees a mirror of her own pain (\u201cso many ways of being orphaned. Now I\u2019m dreaming that", "the orphan\u201d).
