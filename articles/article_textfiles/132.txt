A strangely compelling piece of writing emerges in Germany, putting forth the Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis\u2014the \u201cFame of the Brotherhood of the Rose Cross.\u201d Though several of Rosicrucians\u2019 claims are dubious, to say the least, the movement gains steam among prominent thinkers and leaders. \u201cThese documents claimed that the Brothers of the Rose Cross were engineering a coming Golden Age that would transform all existing political and religious institutions,\u201d writes Kembrew McLeod in his new book", ". \u201cNot only could these men bring about global utopian harmony; they could make themselves", "! Readers who wanted to meet a Brother were told that if they concentrated really, really hard, one would probably drop by for a visit.\u201d", "The Rosicrucians are among the earliest pranksters discussed in McLeod\u2019s entertaining book, which", "starts with the age of Enlightenment and covers four centuries at a breakneck pace.

Benjamin Franklin, to give one example, was a notorious prankster\u2014and a bit of a troll. In the 1730s, Franklin used his", "as a platform to heckle an astrologer named Titan Leeds. Franklin detested Leeds' pseudoscientific claptrap, and Leeds was a business competitor, which only compounded Franklin's ire. Franklin repeatedly predicted Leeds' death in the", ", lampooning astrology and taking aim at Leeds in increasingly specific ways. Leeds would perish on Oct. 17, 1733, at 3:29 p.m., according to one of Franklin's predictions. In further editions of the", ", though Leeds was still among the living, Franklin hopefully initiated a discussion with his ghost. After Leeds finally died in 1738, Franklin continued the onslaught, which went on for several years beyond the grave. \u201cThe 1740 edition of Poor Richard's Almanack described a late-night visit from the Ghost of Titan Leeds, who entered Richard Saunders's brain via his left nostril,\u201d writes McLeod.", "McLeod, a professor at the University of Iowa, is best known for his numerous books on the intersection of copyright and culture.

I went to college at MIT about 15 years ago, where I befriended a ragtag group of hackers and rabble-rousers. My fellow students included people who hacked computers for fun, explored the underground network of tunnels under campus, and architected some of the first hoaxes on the World Wide Web. (Many of these folks went on to lead successful companies, become professors, and shape the world in various meaningful ways.) It\u2019s safe to say that I wouldn\u2019t be a journalist today if I hadn\u2019t had these experiences as a teenager.

And pranks outside of Western culture don\u2019t get much of a mention.

McLeod celebrates good pranks, eschewing the particularly mean-spirited or ham-fisted ones, like fraternity hazing ceremonies. \u201cAlthough \u2018good\u2019 pranks sometimes do ridicule their targets, they serve a higher purpose by sowing skepticism and speaking truth to power (or at least cracking jokes that expose fissures in power\u2019s fa\u00e7ade),\u201d McLeod writes. \u201cA prank a day keeps The Man away, I always say.\u201d Pranksters enter into a sort of feedback loop with the media and can shape the media, too. \u201cPeople don\u2019t just make mischief with media; their mischief can also", "media in the process,\u201d McLeod writes. But some pranks have a dark side, too, wandering into the shadowy territory of deception, con artistry, and conspiracy theories.", "McLeod\u2019s book really gains steam when it hits the 20", "century; it\u2019s clearly what he\u2019s most passionate about. The heady stew of the 1960s\u2014including the Merry Pranksters, and Abbie Hoffman and the Yippies\u2014serves as an object lesson on pranks and how they could interface with society, culture, politics, and activism.

It\u2019s in many ways a stealth autobiography, because all of those things fundamentally shaped who I am today.\u201d The autobiographical chapter lends the book a personal touch, making it feel less like a distant academic survey and more like a passionate, on-the-ground analysis.", "McLeod closes his book with some of the exemplary pranksters of the past decade, including the", "and", ", but he mostly sidesteps the current online maelstrom\u2014 everything from YouTube parodies, viral memes, the denial-of-service attacks that take down websites, and much more. But McLeod\u2019s inspired book poses intriguing questions: Can we draw clear lines between, say, Ben Franklin\u2019s offbeat trolling and the fearless direct action activists of ACT UP? Can we analyze Yoko Ono and the Dead Kennedys under one umbrella\u2014to say nothing of the Rosicrucians and Steve Jobs? Did these myriad pranksters throughout history have a longstanding impact on how we see ourselves, our societies and our governments, and the world at large? The pranks I engaged in long ago taught me that, as McLeod writes, \u201cWhen the world is temporarily turned askew, it can be seen from a new perspective.\u201d", "---", "by Kembrew McLeod.
