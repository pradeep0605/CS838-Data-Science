Trish lives in an America ravaged by a lethal insomnia epidemic. The disease claimed her sister Dori seven years before the novella begins; now Trish volunteers for an emergency organization called the Slumber Corps, soliciting pure sleep from healthy donors. \u201cWe serve an urban core where the rate of insomnia is twenty-two percent higher than the national average,\u201d she explains. \u201cOur Pennsylvania city has one of the greatest REM-sleep deficits on the East Coast.\u201d", "Invoking her sister\u2019s death, Trish is able to convince a couple, the Harkonnens, to donate their baby\u2019s rest to the Slumber Corps. Baby A\u2019s uncorrupted dreams prove valuable enough that the team begins to depend on her as a \u201cuniversal donor,\u201d raising questions of exploitation, innocence, and legacy. Meanwhile, an anonymous donor complicates these questions by polluting the country\u2019s sleep supply with a nightmare so hideous those infected would rather die of insomnia than fall asleep. Is that donor a well-meaning altruist who slipped through the corps\u2019 regulatory net, or a terrorist?", "This sounds like a lot of plot\u2014I\u2019ve yet to mention the two sinister Irish brothers who originally made their fortune in ergonomic toilets\u2014but it doesn\u2019t feel that way. Instead it is signature Russell: a fanciful, droll, elaborately thought-through allegory with a dark center. (People don\u2019t always credit how", "this author can be, but to read Russell is to realize that you can have invention without joy.) Behind the playful deployment of epidemiological jargon lies Trish\u2019s grief over the loss of Dori: \u201cSometimes I think the right doctor could open my chest and find her there \u2026 frozen inside of me, like a face in a locket.\u201d And beneath the ingenuity that calls sunshine \u201cthe coagulant of consciousness, causing us to clot into personalities, to cohere once more on our pillows each morning,\u201d is a dread that human relationships have become too transactional to mean anything. During sex, an exchange that occurs, for Trish, in minutes and concludes with a quick \u201cthank you,\u201d she reflects: \u201cThis is our training. Most of our time is spent asking strangers for donations.\u201d", "Not that you will be reading", "for the plot or even for the themes. You will be reading it for the pleasure of Russell\u2019s language, which is acrid, luminous, and deft, and for the way she confuses the ordinary and the marvelous. She is a special kind of magical realist in that she is wholly committed to both registers. When she describes a woman before the onset of the deadly insomnia\u2014\u201cHer hazel eyes were shining and calm, tenanted by a sane woman, tethered to her memories; her face was happy and plump, irrigated by sleep\u201d\u2014you ricochet between recognition and surprise. Recognition because, as a writer, Russell takes nothing for granted.\u00a0She will chase down every flicker of ordinary experience and return with descriptions of uncanny aptness.\u00a0(Because, of course, craving sleep feels exactly like withering from a kind of thirst; when you drift off, it\u2019s as if those hours of rest are rehydrating your spirit.) Yet\u00a0because she is such an ace draftsperson, her sentences both resonate with familiarity and startle with beauty.

Some customers buy soporifics; others, afflicted with nightmares from contaminated sleep transfusions, take drugs to stay awake. Trish and her guide, Mr. Harkonnen, do both, chasing draughts designed to amplify consciousness with handcrafted sleep cocktails. Duly transported, the pair wanders through a field of poppies, their meandering taking on \u201ca sultry inevitability \u2026 a logic that mimics the odd chordal progressions of dreams.\u201d What are they doing there? It\u2019s not clear; the entire episode has the doped-up feel of sleepwalking, a purposelessness drenched in meaning. By the time Trish and Mr. Harkonnen reach a clearing and lie down to sleep (not\u2014spoiler alert\u2014to sleep together, but side by side to navigate the line between consciousness and oblivion), we\u2019ve left the world of alienating bargains, of cut-and-dried exchange. In", ", this is what intimacy looks like.", "Any insomniac can attest that a night awake seems to distill the trace amounts of loneliness in your life. Russell pursues this idea to an extreme, suggesting that simply to be awake means to desire without end. \u201cPeople are plunging their straws into any available centimeter of shale and water, every crude oil and uranium and mineral well on earth, with an indiscriminate and borderless appetite,\u201d Trish says, considering Slumber Corps\u2019 voracious pumping of Baby A. \u201cFresh air, the sight of trees\u2014these are birthrights and pleasures that we seem bent on extinguishing.\u201d Yet a point comes when all that abundance curdles and turns, when we are buried by our own hungers. Of insomniac Dori, Trish recalls:\u00a0\u201cI hated watching her go speechless under the conglomerate weight of so much unrelenting looking and thinking and listening and feeling, her mind worn thin by the sound of every cough and the plinking moisture of every raindrop, these noises exploding like grenades through her naked awareness\u2014her mind crushed, in the end, by an avalanche of waking moments.\u201d It is hard not to connect the geologic imagery in the two passages, to suspect that Russell has diagnosed something elemental about the way we grasp for things we may or may not want.", "But back to the doubters. Russell has a way of reserving her most sensible tone for the most outlandish details, as if what she\u2019s sketching is not at all illogical or strange. I get the sense her detractors are put off by this, by an effect they perceive as overly twee or coy.\u00a0(One critic grumbled that the \u201c", "overwhelm\u201d her tales\u2019 impact.) But in", ", as in her short stories and", ", matter-of-factness becomes an asset, heightening the weirdness by contrast and acquainting us with our readerly situation: bizarro world, level-headed and trustworthy narrator.
