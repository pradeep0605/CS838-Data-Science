Scott views criticism as both an art form and integral to the survival of other art forms. But his emphasis on criticism\u2019s importance sits side-by-side with a near-populist, very pragmatic insistence that his criticism is meant to guide and aid consumers.", "We met this week at his house in Brooklyn, which is lovely but unkempt in a way that recalled Orwell\u2019s (intentionally overblown) description of a critic\u2019s book-strewn apartment. The most notable features of Scott\u2019s home were the two large, friendly dogs intent on interrupting all human interactions, including an interview, and given little censure by their owner. Scott, wearing slippers and otherwise happy to conform to stereotypes about writers who work from home, was chatty and welcoming, but also surprisingly serious. In his living room, we discussed the controversy over the Oscars, run-ins with needy Hollywood artists, and whether criticism should be nastier. The interview has been edited and condensed.", "There are critics who see their job as to be on the side of the artist, or in a state of imaginative sympathy or alliance with the artist. I think it's important for a critic to be populist in the sense that we\u2019re on the side of the public. I think one of the reasons is, frankly, capitalism. Whether you\u2019re talking about restaurants or you\u2019re talking about movies, you\u2019re talking about large-scale commercial enterprises that are trying to sell themselves and market themselves and publicize themselves. A critic is, in a way, offering consumer advice. I think it\u2019s very, very important in a time where everything is commercialized, commodified, and branded, where advertising is constantly bleeding into other forms of discourse, for there to be an independent voice kind of speaking to\u2014and to some extent on behalf of\u2014the public.", "I think it absolutely is, and I think this is what makes it complicated and what makes the book complicated. It\u2019s simultaneously the job of critics, individually and in the aggregate, to articulate what those standards are. One thing that is always tricky is asking where those standards come from. Whose standards are they? They are not fixed in time, they are not self-evident, they are constantly in dispute and it\u2019s part of the critic\u2019s job not just to sort of to declare or to defend these standards or values, whether ethical or aesthetic or whatever, but to explain them and to refine them and to figure out what they are and how they work.", "You know, it\u2019s hard for me to say what or to give an answer because it\u2019s not like registering in a party. It\u2019s harder than to say I\u2019m a liberal or I\u2019m a conservative. My default position is a kind of humanism. I think that art exists in the service of the dignity of human beings. I think the reason that cinema exists and the thing that gives it its power and charisma is the human face and the ways that it can represent the human face on a scale and with an emotional immediacy that surpasses any other art.", "I\u2019ll fight you on", ".", "is a fucking great movie.", "I think that\u2019s true, and I think that there is a particular problem with the academy and a larger systemic problem with the studios.", "There\u2019s a question of the academy\u2019s membership, and they\u2019re now trying to change the rules and limit the terms. To that extent, it\u2019s sort of a local problem. Another problem is that the function of the academy is to [ensure] prestige and to kind of represent the American film industry\u2019s higher aspirations and goals. In this, it\u2019s different from almost any other awards academy and show. I think what the Oscar nominations this year and last year indicate is how narrow that ideology of prestige is, and how it reflects a political ideology which is liberal in a very kind of old-fashioned and almost pejorative way. When it comes to race in America, it\u2019s based on a kind of tokenism. We gave it to Forrest Whitaker, we gave it to Denzel Washington, we gave it to Halle Barry.", "\u201cAfter all we\u2019ve done for you.\u201d The academy, with its upper-middle-brow notion of prestige, may have room for black performers and for movies about black people and even for black filmmakers who can fit within that, but it really has no room for what you\u2019d call black culture or black popular culture.

That\u2019s a great example because it\u2019s such a tour de force.

There is an idea that we\u2019re producing a newspaper for people who are intellectually curious, who are smart, who are engaged but who aren\u2019t necessarily specialists. In terms of writing about film, I like the fact that it\u2019s not necessarily a highly specialist sort of cinephile that I write for, it\u2019s not an insider.", "I write primarily for myself in that I write to figure out what I think about anything and I can\u2019t really figure that out without writing. I don\u2019t trust thoughts until they\u2019ve gone through the discipline of the writing process.

Just in the way that art can help make sense of what it is to be human, to live in the world.

When you\u2019re younger, there\u2019s more aggression and there\u2019s more of a sense that there\u2019s no middle ground. I used to feel when I started reviewing movies, and when I reviewed books, that I was tougher, I was more uncompromising. When I started reviewing movies, every time I saw a bad movie I would get personally affronted. You want to sort of take revenge and there\u2019s a certain kind of sadistic or self-righteous pleasure in doing that. I\u2019m just going to tear this shit down.", "I think one of the things that changed is my sense of when that was warranted, because there are so many bad movies, and so much mediocrity.

I think it\u2019s much better to have my mistakes corrected by other people than to try to correct them myself.", "I think probably so, but criticism or reviewing is a present tense, very in the moment thing. Part of what we\u2019re doing is the opposite of a definitive judgment. It\u2019s a very early, very provisional, kind of putting down a marker and initiating something that\u2019s going to go on for a very long time.

This is also one of the reasons that individual critics retain some degree of importance in spite of aggregation and Yelp scores. That you can open up the newspaper and find the person that you know.
