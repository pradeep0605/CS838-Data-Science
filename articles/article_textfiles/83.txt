The stakes appear to be much lower. But Spiegelman reveals that her mother\u2019s submerged history also tugged at the family dynamic: \u201cI saw all the ways in which she worked to be a very different mother from her own. And I also saw how much the past, so long kept secret, pulled us into formations like a deep ocean current, from so far below that we barely knew we were not moving on our own.\u201d", "In Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s telling, Jos\u00e9e was unspeakably cruel to her daughter; in Jos\u00e9e\u2019s version, she was a loving mother, wronged by Fran\u00e7oise. That the accounts set forward by mother and grandmother rarely line up means that Spiegelman\u2019s memoir must address not only the therapeutic pain of memory but also, as in", ", its unreliability, subjectivity, and elusiveness.", "The first section, centered on Nadja\u2019s childhood and adolescence in New York, paints Fran\u00e7oise as a ferocious, angry, one-dimensional presence, whirling through a thousand tasks at once. Then Spiegelman starts to filter in detailed scenes from her mother\u2019s early life: the boarding school in France where she suffered hysterical fits, her precocious romance with a local boy (originally Aunt Sylvie\u2019s beau), her fishy relationship with her playboy father, and finally her desperate flight to the States.", "Meanwhile, Jos\u00e9e, now a merry divorc\u00e9e, lives in a houseboat on the Seine, her eyes tattooed with permanent blue liner. She\u2019s \u201ccapable of saying things so terrible they blacked out the sun,\u201d Spiegelman writes. (One gets the sense she would be flattered by this sentence.) Jos\u00e9e still nurses the wounds inflicted by her own mother, Mina, a distant socialite imprisoned after World War II for consorting with a Nazi sympathizer.", "Pierre Andrieu/AFP/Getty Images", "Four generations, four matching sets of Freudian grievance. With this fiercely female chain of stories, Spiegelman has decided to plunge right into the most intimate and radioactive psychic material most women have on hand. Show her a mother, and she will show you a thousand body-shaming criticisms, irrational accusations, and acts of sexual one-upmanship. She will also show you, within that mother, the daughter-who-was, still smarting from her own savage inheritance.", "\u201cShe hated me. Hated", "me,\u201d Fran\u00e7oise tells Nadja, of Jos\u00e9e. Later, Jos\u00e9e protests: \u201c", "\u2026 I was the unwanted child, not her.\u201d To be a mother in the Mouly/Spiegelman line is to inflict pain. To be a daughter is to absorb it. It sometimes feels as though the book is working not in characters but in types; not in defined episodes but in recurring myths. According to Spiegelman, thin Fran\u00e7oise was preoccupied with her daughter\u2019s weight\u2014at one point Fran\u00e7oise grows so convinced that Nadja is sneaking snacks out of the cupboard at night (she isn\u2019t) that Nadja\u2019s sense of reality starts to bend. At the same time, the author\u2019s own flesh is enacting another betrayal. \u201cMy body was whispering to the adults around me in a language I did not understand,\u201d Nadja recalls, noting the glances she is beginning to attract in her parents\u2019 drawing room. As both her mom and her pubescent body turn against her, Nadja makes Fran\u00e7oise into a symbol of all that she is not: \u201cIt seemed to me that in those years my mother only became more and more beautiful. My heart swelled with pride on the rare occasions when she came to school. Short skirts and black turtlenecks, tailored red skirt suits with padded shoulders\u2014everything hung perfectly on her frame.\u201d", "Show Spiegelman a mother, and she will show you a thousand body-shaming criticisms and acts of sexual one-upmanship.", "It\u2019s such an impossibly complicated skein of specific and relatable feelings. The heady, obsessive way a child can worship her mom; the rivalry; the terror of being abandoned, perhaps because you\u2019ve inadvertently broken some secret law. Spiegelman is masterful at loading up her language with more meaning than is at first apparent. Often that fantastical tendency\u2014that rush to interpret\u2014imbues her words with a kind of elliptical peril, as when she writes of her mother: \u201cThe past was always there on her body, but I couldn\u2019t see it. It was in the scars that I traced with a fingertip as a child, in the strange things that set off her anger. It was even in my own body, a feeling of damage and danger that had no name and no explanation.\u201d", "This uncanny sense of history, significance, or trauma waiting to erupt evokes no one so much as Elena Ferrante, another author acutely conscious of the forces coiled tight as a spring within people and objects.

At the heart of", "lie two overlapping mysteries: the mystery of the past, which memory can never accurately conjure, and the mystery of other people, whom you can never truly know. Those paired lacunae expand to fill the space between Spiegelman\u2019s sentences, so that each page feels charged, weighted down with suggestion, but also teasingly remote.", "Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images", "On the subject of memory, Spiegelman is remarkable\u2014mature, wise, and richly expressive. \u201cPure memories are like dinosaur bones,\u201d she writes, \u201cdiscrete fragments from which we compose the image of the dinosaur. They are only flashes: the examining room table in the nurse\u2019s office, the soft hand against the forehead. But memories we tell as stories come alive. Tendons join the bones, muscles and fat and skin fill them out. And when we look again, our memories are whole, breathing creatures that roam our past.\u201d", "It is one of many passages in which the author tries to account for the vast differences between what she, her mother, and her grandmother remember. If Spiegelman seems especially charitable toward women who may have more self-serving reasons to shade history, this generosity is typical of her, the appointed mender of the frayed matrilineal thread.", "But elsewhere, Fran\u00e7oise goes farther, insisting that \u201cthere\u2019s no psychological difference between what you experience and what you imagine \u2026 When I tell you I don\u2019t remember if something actually happened or not, it\u2019s because for me it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d At a moment like this,", "appears to pull back some perceptual curtain and expose \u201cthe twist\u201d: that the dinosaur has no bones, that we all dwell in worlds entirely of our own making.
