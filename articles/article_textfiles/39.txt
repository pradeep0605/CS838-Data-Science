These are the hell-for-leather years, the period when a band from a grimy, bomb-scarred city\u2014a city that didn\u2019t exactly turn out world-beaters\u2014defied long odds and commenced a quest that has something almost preordained about it. In this book, which focuses on 1957 to 1962, Lewisohn picks up on that supernal feel to the Beatles\u2019 success, and at times his own wonder that all of this ever happened, with one amazing coincidence after another, feeds into our own. For instance, crucial, confidence-building early work\u2014a tour as a backing band in Scotland\u2014comes about \u201cnot on merit but because no one else could fill the bill and they shifted everything to make it happen.\u201d A recurring moment, the defining scene of this book, which happens about a dozen times: In doubt, and in the dumps, with ostensibly no prospects to ever get anywhere, one Beatle turns to the others and says, basically, \u201cSomething\u2019ll happen.\u201d And then, boom: It does.", "Huge chunks of the book work this way, and they can even get you pumped up, like an end-of-game sideline speech ushering in the unlikely comeback. And with his accounts of the crucial Hamburg visits, Lewisohn shows admirable restraint, too, focusing as much on the music, the experience that the band gained, and the relationships that they forged among themselves as on the drink and drug saturnalia that typically overrides this portion of the official history. In plain terms, the Beatles sucked when they went to Hamburg for the first time in 1960. They got the gig in the first place only because manager/impresario Allan Williams had no one else to send. But Lewisohn has a knack for underscoring the moment, the precise moment, when things change, and another rung of the ladder is attained. Sometimes he even does the math of those changes for us: \u201cIn seven weeks at the Indra, the Beatles had clocked up 205 stage hours\u2014the equivalent of 136 ninety-minute shows at home. They were transformed. The spark was now a flame. Confidence, charisma, dynamism and fantastic unpredictability", "from them. There was no one else like them, not in Hamburg, not in Liverpool, not anywhere in the world.\u201d", "The last sentence might sound hyperbolic, especially when you recall that the band was pretty much a rough-hewn covers band at this juncture, with a suspect drummer in Pete Best to boot.

I don\u2019t see how \u201c", ",\u201d the song the band, billed as the Beat Boys, cut with Tony Sheridan, is one of the great early British rock and roll records. Granted, there weren\u2019t a lot of great early British rock and roll records, but even if there were like four or five, at best the song was a little less terrible than most of the schlock that was out there. Then again, Lewisohn stumps for the undervalued late \u201962 Star Club recordings as absolutely essential: \u201cBy nothing more fortunate than microphone placement, John\u2019s rhythm guitar is unusually upfront, heard to be a hard, driving engine slicing through the songs.\u201d Bingo.
