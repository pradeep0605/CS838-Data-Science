I hadn\u2019t thought of myself for such a role previously; a poor speller, I rarely copy edited my own papers in college and didn\u2019t have an opinion about the en dash, or even know how to use one.

As she confesses in the introduction to her delightful memoir,", ", she held a quirky array of jobs before she landed at the magazine: milkwoman, costume store clerk, checking the feet of swimmers at a local pool to make sure they had properly applied disinfectant. (This last may have been unique to her hometown of Cleveland.) A friendly family connection, the way all these stories seem to begin, led her to the magazine: At the Art Students League of New York, her brother met the wife of the chairman of the board, who also happened to be the son of", "co-founder Raoul Fleischmann.

My favorite copy commentary comes in a chapter about apostrophes while discussing where to draw the line on style and rules.

I\u2019ve caught errors related to contemporary art, Paris, and Israeli politics. Norris celebrates the job, while making it clear through her book\u2019s very existence that copy editing is also a stepping stone, one that can lead you to be a better editor or writer\u2014perhaps of your own memoir.", "---", "by Mary Norris.
