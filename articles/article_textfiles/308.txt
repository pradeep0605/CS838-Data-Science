{"Body": ["Maddie Edgar", "Paul Auster\u2019s", "is nearly 900 pages long. When I finished the novel, I had a thicket of John Nash\u2013looking notes, a persistent twitch in my left eyelid, and little sense of whether I had just experienced a monumental work of art or a very long con.", "The book opens on Ellis Island, where a Jewish immigrant from Minsk surnamed Reznikoff becomes first \u201cRockefeller\u201d on the advice of a friend, and then \u201cFerguson\u201d at the immigration station due to a Yiddish-English misfire. In America, the first Ferguson has three sons, and one of these sons has one son. The novel comprises four alternate story lines mapping the life of this latter child, Archibald \u201cArchie\u201d Ferguson. These lives are lived in a cluster of towns in northern New Jersey, with supporting roles by New York and Paris, and are focused around the interactions of two primary families, the Fergusons and the Schneidermans, who are originally connected through Ferguson\u2019s mother\u2019s first job in the Schneiderman photo studio.", "We grasp the logic of Auster\u2019s system before too long, but its", "is a mystery that carries us to the end.", "Anyone who has experienced Paul Auster\u2019s hall-of-mirrors postmodern experiments knows to be on her guard for funny business, and it takes time to acclimate to the novel\u2019s logic. The structure makes perfect sense once you get used to it, but the first few chapters open in ways that don\u2019t immediately reveal we are being treated to four separate realities (even if you read the jacket copy). There are four Archies: Archie 1, 2, 3, and 4, let\u2019s call them. His alternate realities are delineated with chapter numbering\u20141.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4\u2014and so on, alternating sections averaging about 30 pages each, all the way to 7.4. It\u2019s not an egregious spoiler to say that some of these alternative lives are shorter than others; when one version of Ferguson sputters out, his pages go blank, the chapter number appearing thereafter in sequence on a blank page, a kind of terse epitaph.", "Readers will acclimate, but that\u2019s not to say they won\u2019t need a crib sheet. The respective courses and outcomes of Ferguson\u2019s lives are different, but they are arrived at by relatively minor variations on several geographic and familial themes, which invite mix-ups (I had to make messy charts on the flyleaves of my copy to keep track of everyone). The Schneiderman family is central to each of Ferguson\u2019s lives, but the roles each Schneiderman plays differ. In one line, it\u2019s Gil Schneiderman who features more prominently; in another, his brother Dan. In each reality, Dan\u2019s daughter Amy is the major presence, sometimes romantic, sometimes familial, or both, in Archie\u2019s life. The true pillar is Archie\u2019s intelligent, spunky, loving mother, Rose. Chapter 1.1 begins, \u201cHis mother\u2019s name was Rose, and when he was big enough to tie his shoes and stop wetting the bed, he was going to marry her.\u201d (Mother-son love, the non-Oedipal kind, is a theme.)", "We grasp the logic of Auster\u2019s system before too long, but its", "is a mystery that carries us to the end of the gargantuan novel. In the first half, very occasional references to something tantalizing called", "kept me in the game. I was hoping that the whole project was going to conclude somewhere really cosmic and weird, maybe even in outer space. This was foolish, because I have read some of Auster\u2019s other novels, and his mysteries tend to begin and end with the text. It takes several hundred pages of", "to realize that, in one sense, you\u2019ve been had. Reading Auster doesn\u2019t typically inspire the use of clich\u00e9, but this novel is really about the journey, and not the destination.", "I think I really like this novel, but I had a variety of uncharitable thoughts when I was reading it. Some of these are perhaps a function of my own attributes. For example, early on I thought to myself: \u201cTruly there is no giant book about baseball and the suburbs that an eminent male writer cannot get published.\u201d This is ultimately a novel about a young man having an uncanny amount of artistic success at a very young age, in several different permutations, and this may be tough going for aspiring writers. Sometimes I rolled my eyes at the fact that each Archie was so brilliant, and so confident in his writing\u2014whether as a critic, journalist, or fiction writer, and despite his excessive protestations about his work\u2014as to publish great works received rapturously in each of his primary lives. He worries about money in each timeline, but unexpected windfalls see him through. If he isn\u2019t getting into Columbia (Archie 1) or Princeton (Archie 4) without superhuman effort, he\u2019s going to Paris (Archie 3) with a beautifully curated Great Books syllabus and living in the maid\u2019s room of his parents\u2019 friend, a glamorous intellectual who personally tutors Archie and helps to get his first book published. \u201cBaby boomers got everything,\u201d I muttered, unfairly.", "This last reading, obviously, has more to do with me than with Paul Auster, but for readers who are familiar with his memoiristic writing, some details of Archie\u2019s lives read as autographical to the extent that you wonder whether Paul Auster has not written a very long chronicle of his own genius. And in that case, Archie\u2019s combination of oft-emphasized goodness, modesty, and hard work become a little much. The various Archies come of age in the late 1960s, and the tumultuous American political climate, both the domestic struggle for civil rights and the disastrous intervention in Vietnam, are a motif of the novel, which focuses on the student sit-ins and clashes with the police at Columbia. I was struck by the way the doomsday mood of the Archies\u2019 young adulthood mirrors the mood in 2016.", "All of the Archies are impeccable in their liberal politics\u2014sometimes to the disdain of their true-left associates\u2014and their moral character is invariably sound, regardless of their occasional shoplifting (Archies 1 and 3) or dalliances with prostitutes (Archie 3). This goodness is expressed by one of Archie 4\u2019s lovers, Evie (formerly his high school teacher):", "Or here is Archie 3:", "Archie always strikes the right tone on matters of difference, be it gender or race or sexuality, to an extent that seems unusual for a young person from the suburbs. For example, Archie 1 shakes his head at his girlfriend Amy\u2019s lack of confidence:", "This goodness is expressed with a comic juxtaposition when the high school\u2013age Archie 3, who has been visiting a black prostitute named Julie, learns that Julie is no longer working, and is offered an appointment with another black woman. Young Archie is indignant: \u201cBlack girl\u2014what\u2019s that got to do with it? I thought you went for black girls. I go for all girls. I just happened to like Julie.\u201d", "There are reasons for this portrayal of the Archies. The book is about the journey, but looking back on these passages, armed with the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d that can only be gleaned from reading to the end, it makes sense that Archie might be painted rather heroically. (Sorry to be cryptic, but Paul Auster invariably requires some acrobatics for anyone trying to efficiently summarize without spoilers.)", "Another characteristic that may or may not be intentional is the rhythm of the novel\u2019s sentences, which are very long and breathless with commas. They seem strangely awkward from a writer who wrote the beautiful measured prose of", ". This is a characteristic passage from", ":", "Paradoxically, these sentences made me itch, but they also helped propel me through the novel. They gallop, like the very passing of time.", "Curiously,", "reminded me of nothing so much as another recent novel that is very long and very odd\u2014Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s", ", a book I ended up disliking but which galloped you along in a similar way, so that you weren\u2019t always sure why you were reading but (incorrectly) assumed were being led to some great reward. That novel is also focused on a too-good-to-be true character; but whereas Yanagihara\u2019s Jude is a lesson that no amount of adoration for a preternaturally good, hardworking person by his friends and lovers can make up for a childhood full of hideous abuse, Auster is operating from the obverse position: that there\u2019s nothing a preternaturally good, hardworking person with the unflagging love of his mother and a reasonably stable upbringing in middle-class or better circumstances can\u2019t do. (Unless he accidentally dies, of course\u2014that\u2019s the big X-factor).", "This novel is rich and detailed.
