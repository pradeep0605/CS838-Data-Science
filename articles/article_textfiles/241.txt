If a Catholic can be a mensch, Gabe is one. He\u2019s the kind of guy whom strangers trust. And many of them do more than trust him: They are prone to confessing their worst sins to him at the most inopportune times. A tailor confesses to Gabe that he lingered too long over his wife\u2019s dying body to donate her organs; a man who carelessly killed a fellow teenager years ago with his car needs absolution in order to allow himself to drive again.

But Madeline is not a monster. Bauer could have gone for sour and easy laughs at the expense of the ambitious single ad executive who wants to wring cash out of one of the last remaining untainted intimacies.

In my experience that\u2019s a struggle experienced by many people raised in religious traditions that they can\u2019t in good conscience fully embrace as adults. For some people it\u2019s easy to say \u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d and move on into shining secular freedom. But for others\u2014maybe we\u2019re just weaker!\u2014it\u2019s more complicated.
