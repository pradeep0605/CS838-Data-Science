Patterson seems to have spoken to every person who ever pondered the relationship of Satan to guitars in wintertime. Every aspect of black metal is allotted its 15 minutes of blasphemy: its roots in punk, thrash, and death metal; its progenitors (Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Venom, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost); its early flowerings in Canada, Switzerland, Greece, and the United States; its Cambrian explosion in Norway; its developments in France, Sweden, Poland, and Japan; its snaking into increasingly unwieldy subgenres; its present-day \u201cpost-black-metal\u201d incarnations.", "It\u2019s the Norwegian scene that receives the most attention, since Norway is black metal\u2019s Liverpool, Memphis, and New Orleans all in one, home to the bands that matter the most: Darkthrone, Mayhem, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon, Ulver, Gorgoroth, Enslaved.

Mostly, he just lets the band members talk, a strategy that has the fortunate effect of keeping his own prose to a minimum. It seems never to have occurred to Patterson (and too many other metal critics, though of course there are exceptions\u2014", "and", ", for instance) that writing might be more than a vehicle for the conveyance of information.
