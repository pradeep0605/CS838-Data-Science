But her heart isn\u2019t in the conflict-ridden state; it is in Australia, where her parents\u2019 bones are buried. Throughout the novel, Dina is beset with memories of her childhood in a Melbourne suburb where she grew up with \u201caunts\u201d and \u201cuncles\u201d who were not related to her by blood but rather by history. Survivors of the Holocaust who emigrated to Australia from Europe, they were the backdrop of Dina\u2019s early years and the only kind of extended family she had.", "Some of those survivors, like Dina\u2019s father, never spoke about their experiences in the camps. But for others, like Dina\u2019s mother, the silence broke and became an obsessive rehashing of the terrors\u2014much like the authors of Holocaust literature, the storytellers were trying to understand what they\u2019d been through.

Dina spends the hours dreading the possible bomb\u2014the location of which is unknown\u2014despite knowing that alerts are common and often don\u2019t lead to anything. She falls into reveries spurred on by her mother\u2019s presence and loses sense of where she is. Her disappearance into memories is helpful for the reader, as it fills in useful backstory, but it\u2019s also an apparent symptom of her second-generation trauma. (Dissociation, which seems to be what Dina experiences during these trips down memory lane, is a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder.)", "Eitan dismisses Dina\u2019s concerns, and their son is comfortable with the situation. As Eitan says, \u201cThere are hundreds of warnings every day in this country.

But she is far more Israeli than she thinks, even if she\u2019s still considered an outsider by her husband. In one memorable scene, she rushes to her son\u2019s school with the premonition that he is in danger; she becomes convinced that one Arab worker at the school, wearing a bulky jacket, is hiding a suicide bomb. Anyone who\u2019s lived in Israel has seen a moment of casual xenophobia that turns quickly into panic and rage, or undergone one herself.", "At the same time, Israelis are often quite aware of the realities of other foreigners who come into their country.

Dina\u2019s clinic is a convenient place for Kaminsky to explore the diversity of Haifa: Over the course of her morning appointments, Dina encounters the same garrulous old lady mentioned above, a Christian Palestinian woman hoping to have a son, and a hypochondriac Russian immigrant. Though these could read as stereotypes of the Israeli population, Kaminsky handles them with grace, though occasionally she, like Dina, seems to suffer from \u201ccompassion fatigue,\u201d as these characters\u2019 stories aren\u2019t explored as deeply as they could have been.", "In the end,", "is not only Dina\u2019s story but that of a second-generation diaspora who chose to move to Israel despite their parents eschewing that option after World War II.
