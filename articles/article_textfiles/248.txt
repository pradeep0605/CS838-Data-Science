{"Body": ["Illustration by Ed Luce", "Jacky Colliss Harvey\u2019s", "is framed as a blend of art history and pop sociology, but it is much more than that. It is a manifesto\u2014and a dangerous one. \u201cPeople still express biases against red hair in language and in attitudes of unthinking mistrust that they would no longer dream of espousing or of exposing if the subject were skin color, or religion, or sexual orientation,\u201d Harvey writes. Redheads are the \u201cwhite-skinned other\u201d of the world, she says. Bias against them constitutes \u201cone of the last great social prejudices.\u201d Harvey has even found websites on the Internet that \u201ctypify redheads as impulsive, irrational, quick-tempered, passionate, and iconoclastic.\u201d", "Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at the", ". Follow her on", ".", "She\u2019s right: Nobody\u2019s got it worse than gingers. As it should be. Redheads are mutants and probable vampires who are ruining the fabric of society, and they must be stopped.", ", I thought when I dove into Harvey\u2019s tract,", "So imagine my disappointment when I discovered that Harvey\u2019s book is actually a", "of redheads. In fact, the author is a redhead herself. (Apparently they\u2019re allowed to publish books in some countries?) Worse, Harvey seems proud of her condition. She boasts of being born with a Worcestershire orange mop that\u2019s since settled into a \u201cproper copper\u201d in adulthood, and\u2014well, you get the picture; the last thing any of us needs is another carrot top rubbing her color story in all of our faces. In short: \u201cIt is, with me, as with many other redheads, the single most significant characteristic of my life,\u201d Harvey says. The hair \u201coverpowers everything else. It becomes all people see.\u201d", "Can you blame us for staring? Redheads\u2014particularly those with the trademark white skin, freckled cheeks, and emerald eyes\u2014are practically flaunting their mutation whenever they slather on enough SPF 1,000 to step into the light of day. For the most part, Harvey\u2019s book is an examination of how redheads like her have been depicted in art, literature, and", "by all the artists and writers who just can\u2019t look away. This is acceptable, I suppose. Harvey did not choose to be born with the devil\u2019s mark growing from her scalp, and if she and her fellow gingers would like to spend their time grouped together in the shade, reading a book about near-relatives such as Prince Harry, Carrot Top, and Judas, then so be it. I admit I found myself illuminated by Harvey\u2019s discussion of the changing cultural depictions of such contested historical scalps as Mary Magdalene, Cleopatra, and Benedict Cumberbatch.", "Life\u2019s never been easy for a ginger. In societies with little ethnic diversity, a redhead was easily othered, and over time took on associations with Satan, generalized evil, cowardice, prostitution, shadiness, and so on. In the year 403, St. Jerome warned that red hair on a girl would \u201cpresage for her the fires of hell.\u201d Historical renderings of Judas as a carrot top sparked a long-standing association between Jewish people and redheadedness: In medieval Germany, freckles were called", "and at certain points in time, both Jews and redheads were slurred as possessing \u201cbad character at best and barbarity at worst.\u201d Shakespeare\u2019s Shylock was typically depicted with a red wig well into the 19", "century.", "I found myself illuminated by discussion of the contested historical scalps of Mary Magdalene, Cleopatra, and Benedict Cumberbatch.", "Harvey doggedly traces such bigotry\u2019s lasting effects on more contemporary redheads. She casts a sinister eye on Orson Welles\u2019 decision to cast wife Rita Hayworth in", "in 1947, a role that required her to dye her trademark red curls a platinum blond. \u201cIf you want to tame a redhead, turn her into a blonde,\u201d Harvey writes. Welles\u2019 bleaching of Hayworth was, Harvey suspects, \u201csymptom of an attempt to control Hayworth as his marriage to her failed.\u201d Even today, redheads are tormented by \u201cthe experience of complete strangers coming up to comment upon or even to reach out and touch\u201d their hair\u2014certainly the", ". And even when a prominent blonde or brunette attempts to sympathize with the redhead\u2019s cause, she inevitably stumbles over her ignorant language. Recently Taylor Swift announced, \u201cI would do a ginger,\u201d a comment Harvey calls \u201cpatronizingly infamous.\u201d Harvey invites readers to try \u201csubstituting \u2018person whose skin, rather than hair, is a different color from mine\u2019 for \u2018ginger\u2019 in that remark, and see how bad it tastes then.\u201d I have to admit that she\u2019s right: Replace a nonracist statement with a racist statement, and it becomes racist.", "The equation of anti-redhead bias with racism is a constant refrain in", ". \u201cPart of the problem here is that gingerism doesn\u2019t", "like it\u2019s racism, and in a way it\u2019s not, or at least not in the way we are used to thinking of it,\u201d Harvey allows. And yet: \u201cThere have been some horrendous cases in recent years of redheaded children being bullied to the point of suicide. That has to stop,\u201d she writes. \u201cWould it be acceptable for a child to be bullied at all, let alone to death, because of their skin color? Their religion? Their own or their parents\u2019 race, their own or their parents\u2019 sexuality?\u201d Of course not. This is the 21", "century. There is no place in civilized society for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, and any other form of bigotry \u2026 except for gingerism, which is as necessary as it is real. That\u2019s why no right-thinking mother would allow her brown- or black-haired children to mingle with redheads on the playground\u2014much less allow them to enter a redheaded home, where they may be at risk of falling into the house boiling cauldron or spirited away on a magic broom carelessly left unattended in the backyard.", "Of course I suspect the author to be a witch. Harvey labors to dissuade readers of the idea that redheads are associated with the occult, which comes across as a little defensive in my opinion. Harvey would have us believe that the red hair assigned to the witches in", "is little more than a spot of \u201clocal color\u201d sprinkled in to jazz up the Scottish Play. Nice try. It bears repeating that the author is a redhead and thus cannot be trusted on this or, frankly, any other matter except for possibly the location of the local eye-of-newt store. To my knowledge the Witchhunter General has not tested Harvey\u2019s buoyancy, so for now her witch status remains unresolved. Refreshingly, Harvey is somewhat less shy about discussing her possible association with vampirism. She writes: \u201cVampires, so the thinking goes, are bloody; red is the color of blood, therefore redness must predispose one to vampirism.\u201d", "Though she is plausibly a vampire, Harvey is correct in pointing out the societal double standard applied to male and female redheads. Harvey traces \u201can age old connection\u201d between \u201cred hair in women and sexual desirability.\u201d", "Due to their superior absorption of vitamin D, redheads have been heralded as assets in childbearing. Some associations are cruder. \u201cRed is the color of blood,\u201d Harvey reiterates. \u201cOne of the most ancient slurs thrown at redheads is that they are the product of sex during menstruation, in itself one of the oldest of sexual taboos.\u201d (I\u2019m obligated to note here that Harvey is unable to prove that redheads are", "created by period sex.) Moreover, redheads are red in more places than the name would suggest. \u201cSet against a redhead\u2019s normally pale skin,\u201d a naked ginger\u2019s pink nipples and genitals function like \u201cflashing a set of sexual super-stimuli\u201d at her partner, and \u201cdoubly so when aroused, when the coloring in these parts of the body deepens.\u201d Some even say that at the completion of orgasm, \u201cthe skin flush is particularly noticeable and gratifying\u201d in a redhead. But perhaps because redheaded women are seen as hypersexual beings, redheaded men have been coded as the opposite\u2014cowardly wimps.\u00a0 When Americans were surveyed on the matter in 1979, redheaded women were seen as \u201cbrainy but no-nonsense, and slightly scary to the opposite sex,\u201d while men were seen as \u201cgood but effeminate\u201d and \u201ctimid and weak.\u201d", "To be blunt, \u201cred hair in men equals bad, in women equals good, or at least sexually interesting.\u201d The sexism here is unacceptable. In 2015, I\u2019d hope that we are all enlightened enough to recognize that red hair equals bad regardless of the redhead\u2019s gender.", "When Harvey\u2019s manifesto has finished counting perceived social slights against redheads, it turns to advocating for red power. Near the book\u2019s end, Harvey is seated on a train traveling toward Holland when she spies another redhead across the aisle.", ", I find myself intoning inwardly,", ",\u201d she writes. Finally, \u201cred hair is starting to stand for something new and desirable.\u201d She praises Julianne Moore\u2019s 2015 Best Actress Oscar win as a \u201ctipping point\u201d for ginger acceptability. (Notably, Lindsay Lohan does not appear once in this book, an ominous omission that says everything you need to know about Harvey\u2019s pro-ginger bias.) She recommends radical pro-redhead websites such as \u201c", "\u201d and \u201c", "\u201d for further reading. The train, by the way, was headed for a festival devoted to redhead boosterism, where the freckled masses spoke excitedly about \u201ca redheaded moment not that far off, a redhead renaissance indeed.\u201d Chilling.", "Hey! My dad is a redhead, and my beard had a lot of red in it before it turned white. Is there a one drop rule here or what?", "", "-J P McMahon", "", "", "", "Harvey even argues that women ought to be allowed to dye their hair red if they so choose. \u201cTaking control of your appearance (your", "), and having the freedom to make choices about it \u2026 is a part of the ongoing emancipation of the female sex and now, many a onetime minority group as well\u2014redheads included.\u201d Why any natural blonde or brunette would willingly choose to debase herself in such a way I don\u2019t know, but the thought is frightening and we ought to consider legislation to deter women from falling to the bronze side. If Harvey and her growing gangs of redheads had their way, red hair dye would be readily available at the corner drugstore, as easy to access as emergency contraception.", "Truth be told, a part of me can sympathize with Harvey\u2019s cause. I was born with a head of orangutan fuzz that\u2019s since faded to a blond that, in the dead of winter, still betrays a strawberry tint. Sometimes I miss being one of them. Mostly, though, I maintain a healthy sense of perspective.", "\u201cI began working through the final draft of this book in New York, watching thousands of people march wearing t-shirts bearing the words", ",\u201d Harvey writes in the book\u2019s conclusion. \u201cAnd if all of this seems to have become rather political all of a sudden, that\u2019s because when you drill down into it, dammit, it is.\u201d To Harvey, \u201cA world that can\u2019t deal with something as small and insignificant as people whose hair is a different color is one where there is little hope of dealing with any of the problems created by those far bigger issues, or different skins, different faiths, different loves, different lives.\u201d", "Personally, I think a world where we care more about cops killing unarmed black men than we do kids teasing each other over their hair color is a world that has its priorities straight.
