It\u2019s a pocket book, a pulp novel, a spinner-rack book. It\u2019s the cheapest, smallest paperback format\u2014the book designed for impulse purchase in the airport or drugstore. As a child, I read plenty of larger-format, or trade paperbacks\u2014most of the middle-grade or young-adult novels I bought from Waldenbooks with my allowance money were printed at that size.

Dog-eared, spines broken, they fit in a purse or a pocket, and fit into the busy lives and schedules of the grown-ups in my world. (In their portability and impulse-buy cheapness, they were the e-books of their day.) When my brother handed me", ", with its 340 pages of teensy print, I realized I was entering a different world of reading. I may have been all of 11, but I wasn\u2019t a kid anymore.", "As an adult reader, I\u2019ve always fetishized mass-markets. I treasure crummy 1960s paperbacks the way real book collectors prize their Philip Roth first editions. My wife has learned that while I always love a good used bookstore, I\u2019m a lot more likely to force her to wait around while I peruse the shelves of Goodwills and church bazaars, where piles of mass-markets go for a quarter each, donated by readers to make room for the new Grisham or Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection. (My wife is also very tolerant of the rainbow of mass-markets on our living room shelves, organized by color.)", "I\u2019m infatuated by the way that mass-market publication maps the mainstream taste of American readers; after all, no one publishes a book in mass-market unless they think it\u2019s something Joe Schmoe might buy while he\u2019s hustling to catch the 5:48 to Ossining. And so the last 60 years of American reading habits can be seen in the kinds of books that were published in mass-market, bought in mass-market, read by the pool in mass-market, and eventually given away to the thrift shop.", "Genre fiction, of course, always appears in mass-market. Sci-fi and fantasy, like", ". Mystery, romance, Western, thriller. Pop fiction for all audiences, from chick lit to legal thrillers to horror novels. The mass-market has always implied a certain kind of disposability. Just read the message on the title page of most mass-markets: \u201cIf this book is coverless, it may have been reported to the publisher as \u2018unsold or destroyed\u2019 and neither the author nor the publisher may have received payment for it.\u201d Why is that message there? Because mass-markets are so cheap that it\u2019s not worth it for a bookstore to pay shipping to return unsold copies to the publisher; they\u2019re so flimsy that it\u2019s not worth a publisher\u2019s while to receive thumbed-through, un-resellable mass-markets in a box. So when a mass-market doesn\u2019t sell, unlike with a hardcover, the store doesn\u2019t return the book for credit with the publisher. It rips off the front cover and sends", "in. The rest of the book goes in the dumpster\u2014or, perhaps, is re-sold by unscrupulous bookstore employees. (Hence the warning.)", "But mass-market doesn\u2019t just mean pop. (Or trash.)

Indeed, given the number of highbrow mid-century writers whose work I find in mass-market paperback, the format seems to have been the way publishers once introduced literary writers into the broader public consciousness\u2014or maybe it\u2019s just that once upon a time the broader public had a greater interest in what the literary writers were up to.", "Photo by Alia Smith", "I\u2019m at the beach for a week with my family\u2014usually the only time all year I get to read for pure pleasure, not for work\u2014and this summer I\u2019ve packed a bag full of nothing but mass-market paperbacks.
