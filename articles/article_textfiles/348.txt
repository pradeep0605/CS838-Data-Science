Being gay would no longer be something that\u2019s merely tolerated in a liberal state that made room for any kind of freak; LGBT equality would no longer mean the dominant society would hold its nose while granting rights to members of a group it despised. Instead, it would mean embracing gay and transgender people as equally worthy of respect and dignity. \u201cThe gay movement was stuck with two choices,\u201d writes Hirshman about the post-Stonewall era. \u201cThey could ask the society to ignore or tolerate their behavior, immoral or not, in the interests of higher values like freedom or privacy.\u201d Or they could insist that they and their actions", "moral, that, in short, \u201cgay is good.\u201d", "That phrase, \u201cgay is good,\u201d is borrowed from the late Frank Kameny, an indefatigable gay rights crusader who was fired from his government job as an astronomer in the 1950s and who\u2014rare for his time\u2014never seemed to doubt for an instant that he was as good a human soul as any straight person. Whether the rest of the LGBT universe has followed Kameny\u2019s inspiring lead\u2014and whether having that \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d as Hirshman calls it, is responsible for carving a path to full equality and to \u201cchanging America for everyone\u201d\u2014remains in question, even after completing this lively movement history.", "Certainly there were leaders like Kameny who asserted gay virtue from the outset (though even he scolded two lesbians for holding hands at a march the week after Stonewall). Harry Hay, a founder of the 1950s homophile Mattachine Society, demanded to \u201cbe respected for our differences not for our sameness to heterosexuals.\u201d Carl Wittman, a gay SDS activist, wrote in his 1970 \u201cGay Manifesto,\u201d \u201cWe have to learn that our loving each other is a good thing, not an unfortunate thing, and that we have a lot to teach straights about sex, love, strength, and resistance.\u201d Wittman here voiced not only the equal virtue of gay people but a \u201cvalue-added\u201d notion that the movement had something to teach the world, an achievement Hirshman also attributes to what she dubs the \u201cgay revolution.\u201d", "But if some leaders voiced such ambitious moral sentiments, innumerable others, along with ordinary LGBT people afraid\u2014quite understandably\u2014to ever leave the closet, felt little or no moral certainty about either their goodness or their cause. Even after impressive levels of progress were achieved, it is not clear this was the result of moral certainty. I\u2019d say nearly every LGBT American knows someone\u2014perhaps themselves\u2014who has stood up to fight for equality, perhaps with great success, but despite lingering self-hatred and a profound sense that they were not good, but rotten at their core. When Hirshman says of David Mixner, the prominent anti-war and gay rights activist, that he \u201cknew he was different\u201d and \u201cthought he was bad,\u201d she is pithily describing not just many people in the movement but their motive for joining it.", "In fact, contrary to Hirshman\u2019s assertion, the historical record of the LGBT movement emphasizes an embrace of the hold-your-nose zone of privacy more than an insistence on moral virtue. From the start of the organized gay rights movement in the mid-20", "century, gay leaders embraced this liberal zone of tolerance as their best hope for freedom. And it was", ", more than equality, they sought. Above all, they wanted to be left alone from the entrapment, police raids, and violence of fellow citizens that resulted from being a despised minority.", "This changed over time, of course. By the 1980s, the zone of privacy was inadequate both in practice and in theory. In particular, it was no shield against the ravages of AIDS. Any other public health epidemic of equivalent scale would have (indeed had) drawn far greater government efforts to stop the dying, and the neglect in the case of AIDS was clearly driven by anti-gay animus. The mental and physical anguish that resulted spurred some of the most effective and enduring forms of activism in American history, from the Lavender Hill Mob\u2019s haunting \u201cSilence = Death\u201d poster art to the street theater of ACT UP.", "But did it change to the point that", ", to use Hirshman\u2019s word, properly characterizes the struggle for gay equality? \u201cFueled by its moral ambition,\u201d she writes, the movement not only claimed a place for gays and lesbians at the table, but allowed them to \u201ctake on their whole society and wrench it onto a different path altogether.\u201d Yet although Hirshman argues that the movement \u201cchanged America for everyone,\u201d again and again she describes the conservative co-optings of a political movement whose ultimate effect was less to change the nation than to compel it \u201cto include [gays] in the social contract.\u201d Fighting their way to equal citizenship is no small accomplishment, but it\u2019s a different achievement than changing the nation for everyone. And it\u2019s a more modest achievement than convincing the country that you\u2019re morally good. After all, if just over one-half the nation finds homosexuality acceptable, that still leaves almost one-half that doesn\u2019t. And there\u2019s probably not a single gay American whose day-to-day experience allows them yet to forget this\u2014another reason that declaring \u201cvictory\u201d seems a bit of a stretch.", "Photo byNina Subin.", "Hirshman surely knows this, and in fairness her focus is more on the moral certainty of gay people than the moral conversion of straights. By 2009, the first year of Obama\u2019s presidency, \u201call the pieces were in place\u201d for victory, Hirshman tells us, including that \u201ca critical number of movement players were unambivalent about their moral rectitude.\u201d And when the president signed into law the end of the ban on openly gay troops the next year, \u201cthe moral self-confidence that has characterized the successful parts of the gay revolution from the beginning won the day.\u201d Yet did the gay movement get where it got by internalizing moral certainty? Even after the \u201cmainstreaming\u201d years of the last two decades, as activists turned away from their liberation ideology in favor of joining the most traditional American institutions\u2014the church, the military, and the conjugal family\u2014there was rarely an embrace of morality. Instead, the struggle remained focused on tolerance more than approval, rights more than virtue.", "The 2003 landmark Supreme Court decision that struck down state sodomy bans,", ", was decided on privacy grounds, not equal protection. And when California voters yanked away the freedom to marry from gay people in a 2008 ballot initiative, the LGBT movement chose to fight that battle in defensive terms. The right wing whipped up opposition with ads saying that allowing gays to marry would mean teaching school children it was OK to be gay. The gay movement did not respond,", ", but insisted,", "Certainly a focus on the moral virtues of gay people has become a central theme of the movement as it turned to inclusion in mainstream institutions, as Hirshman points out: \u201cWhen the gay revolution took after marriage and the military, it was making a bid for membership not just in the cold precincts of the liberal state, but in the club of social acceptance. \u201d Marriage is, by definition, a quest for public recognition, and leaders like Evan Wolfson recognized early on that marriage equality was perhaps the most potent weapon to insist on the moral equality of gays, who must not be left \u201cin a little huddle,\u201d as Wolfson said, forever separate and unequal.", "But does this fact support the argument that \u201cmoral confidence\u201d propelled movement victory? African-Americans felt plenty of moral gravity for their cause, yet Hirshman says their movement \u201cfell short\u201d of their most ambitious goals, in part because they could conceal their difference better than gays\u2014a bizarre claim on its face. And if moral certainty was central to the LGBT movement, whose morality was it? Indeed, the whole mainstreaming trend embodied by the fight for marriage and military service is heretical to some who have viewed their movement in fiercely ethical terms, but who have always trumpeted an alternative set of ethics to those of the dominant society: that pleasure is a good in its own right, even when not linked to procreation; that communal ties may create more inclusive care than the isolating and exclusionary nuclear family; that dominant norms are not good just because they\u2019re dominant, but only if they serve the common interest; that people should feel safe to be different.", "To Carl Wittman, who implored gays to \u201cstop mimicking straights\u201d and instead teach them new things about sex and love, or the contemporary queer thinkers who continue to prioritize liberation from dominant norms over affirmation by the majority, mainstream acceptance of LGBT people in church pews and military barracks is hardly a triumph. That Hirshman starts her book with a parable about \u201ca cross-dressing homosexual activist\u201d being named real estate national salesperson of the year and hence becoming a \u201cposter boy\u201d for establishment success might add insult to injury. Is that really what we were fighting for?", "Of course, pleasure", "become far more acceptable to most Americans; the supremacy of the nuclear family has come under needed scrutiny; the primacy of norms has been challenged. Gay people didn\u2019t cause these things to happen\u2014Puritan values began to collapse for complex reasons long before the first gay rights group met in Chicago in 1924. But the LGBT movement contributed mightily. The world feels different, and better, as a result of their struggle for equality. That a straight woman has written such an adoring history of the movement is itself a testament to its impact. Hirshman has done a great service in putting the question of morality in this movement on the table. Though important chapters are yet to be written, this book will help the world to see that gay is good\u2014and getting better.", "---", "by Linda Hirshman.
