Is your life a tale of a little guy triumphing over hardship, or a saga of back-stabbing and injustice? Perhaps your story insists that a few committed souls have the power to triumph over the Man or that nice guys finish last. Whatever narrative order you impose on what Didion described as the \u201cshifting phantasmagoria \u2026 which is our actual experience,\u201d it will not only color that experience but inexorably shape it.", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "the new novel by", "author Lauren Groff, depicts two lives, and each life is shaped by the kind of story favored by the person who lives it. Lancelot \u201cLotto\u201d Satterwhite and Mathilde Yoder meet in college and wed two weeks later; they will be married for 24 largely happy years. Lotto fails as an actor in New York City, then succeeds, under Mathilde\u2019s covert guidance, as a playwright. They live together intimately, but the stories they tell themselves about their relationship and how the world works are far, far apart.", "In a", "in the", ", Groff said she\u2019d originally thought of", "as two small novels (a little like Evan S. Connell\u2019s", "and", "), but publishing them separately proved impractical. So despite their differences, these halves, \u201cFates\u201d and \u201cFuries,\u201d arrive united in a single binding, married, much as Lotto and Mathilde are. The novel is in many ways", "marriage, as many critics have observed. But it\u2019s also about something even more universal than love. Two people sharing the same home and what seems to be the same life can occupy entirely different planets, storywise; two very different short novels can, bound together, explore the way we use stories to get what we need to make sense of our own lives and others\u2019.", "To explain what I mean, I\u2019ll need to go deeper into the plot of", "than the typical review might do. If you haven\u2019t read this novel, and can\u2019t abide spoilers, then by all means stop here, although you might first note that researchers at the University of California at San Diego found that", "when they\u2019d been told the endings in advance. I think that\u2019s even more true of", "than it is of most stories; so consider sacrificing surprise, the lowest form of literary pleasure, for the much richer satisfaction the first half of this novel can deliver when read in light of the second.", "begins with Lotto\u2019s view, infused with an understanding of life as ruled by luck. Born rich, white, and the darling of a Florida family that considers him destined for greatness, he\u2019s charismatic, expansive, irresistible to women. His marriage to Mathilde puzzles his old college friends. \u201cShe\u2019s so calm and quiet. Ice queen,\u201d one girl remarks at the first of a series of parties the young couple throws in their basement apartment in Greenwich Village. \u201cLotto\u2019s the loudest. Warm, sexy. Opposites.\u201d He seems to move through the world under a sheltering parasol. \u201cNo matter what, you win,\u201d his exasperated wife remarks. \u201cIt all works out for you in the end. Always. Someone or something\u2019s looking out for you.\u201d", "Yet that someone is more often than not Mathilde herself, as the second half of the book attests. Hers is a life governed by sheer will, and what a ferocious and unforgiving one it is.", "Unlike \u201cFates,\u201d \u201cFuries\u201d is preposterously, deliriously fictional, a pell-mell plunge through an array of genre homages.", "Lotto can\u2019t believe his good fortune in landing Mathilde, \u201cthis gorgeous girl he\u2019d magicked into wife,\u201d while Mathilde knows that, frantic about her future on the eve of graduation, she set her cap for him after learning about his family\u2019s money. She patiently outmaneuvered the competition and orchestrated a meeting under the most opportune circumstances. That she was attracted to Lotto, and soon came to deeply love him, was really just a side benefit.", "Here and there throughout the novel, Groff inserts little remarks in brackets; at first they seem like authorial asides, although whoever\u2019s commenting refers to themselves as \u201cwe.\u201d Their tone, always omniscient, shifts when the perspective flips. In Lotto\u2019s half of the book, they tend to be predictive: \u201cShe would have a life on film, he knew it even now. [Yes, small roles, hers a small spark.]\u201d In Mathilde\u2019s, they lean toward the vindictive: \u201cWhen you\u2019re least expecting it, I will explode your life. [Only fair; she had exploded his.]\u201d A reference to measuring a thread explains all: Lotto\u2019s story is annotated by the Fates, the Greek goddesses of destiny, and Mathilde\u2019s by the Furies, the goddesses of retribution.", "It\u2019s easy to read \u201cFuries\u201d as a refutation of \u201cFates,\u201d as the hard, wifely truth behind the golden facade of Lotto\u2019s blessed ease. But living on luck has its terrors, because luck can always turn bad. Depression and the specter of suicide lurk at the corners of Lotto\u2019s story, seeded by his adored father\u2019s sudden, fatal stroke and the awareness that at any moment the bottom might fall out of the world. Mathilde shelters Lotto from the consequences of bad luck, but there is some ill fortune even Mathilde\u2019s implacable determination can\u2019t overcome.", "Lotto\u2019s tale is a pleasant glide, despite its sprinkling of sorrows, and resembles any number of wry, fond, realistic literary novels about contemporary life. On its own, without those teasing intimations of Mathilde\u2019s hidden self scattered throughout \u201cFates,\u201d it would be unremarkable. Groff is an agreeable stylist, although she can lean too hard on her metaphors, reaching for idiosyncrasy. Unlike most writers of \u201clyrical\u201d prose, Groff keeps her sentences short, often fragmentary, to generate a sense of momentum, moving the narrative briskly through even the more bizarre descriptions\u2014\u201chot milk of a world, with its skin of morning fog in the window,\u201d clouds like \u201cblackberry jam\u201d; it\u2019s always weather that brings out the worst in this type of writer\u2014before they can grate on your nerves.", "Then comes Mathilde\u2019s half of the novel. Unlike \u201cFates,\u201d \u201cFuries\u201d is preposterously, deliriously fictional, a pell-mell plunge through an array of genre homages. There\u2019s Mathilde\u2019s peasant childhood as a fishwife\u2019s daughter in Brittany before she is exiled to the care of a prostitute grandmother in a Parisian garret\u2014pure Zola, even to the point of seeming weirdly unmoored from the 20", "century. Then comes a gothic,", "adolescence in a big, empty house filled with locked doors under the care of a sinister uncle (\u201csome kind of manager in a bad organization\u201d). This interlude features a scene where the uncle laps up a panna cotta, leaving \u201ccream in the folds of his mouth,\u201d while, in case you missed the point, Mathilde watches a cat kill a field mouse. Then comes Mathilde\u2019s Vassar education funded by a domineering older man who teaches her about art and wine and subjects her to a string of elegantly degrading sex acts. \u201cWhat next?!\u201d I wrote in the margins of my copy, only to turn the page and find Lotto\u2019s mother on the phone, a toxic, possessive agoraphobe straight out of Tennessee Williams, murmuring honeyed Southern venom in Mathilde\u2019s ear and offering her a million bucks to \u201cleave my poor child in peace, let him sow his wild oats, eventually find himself some good, sweet girl and come home to Florida to me.\u201d", "But wait, there\u2019s more! In the course of her adventures, Mathilde will inherit a fortune. She will hire (and sleep with) a private detective and master of disguise, a young woman who is never named\u2014but since she arranges to meet Mathilde on the Upper East Side, we might as well just call her Harriet. Mathilde will discover that an old friend has dealt her a grievous blow to satisfy a grudge nursed in absolute secrecy for decades. She will spend a sizable chunk of her inheritance to settle a score of her own, nursed for even longer. Then she sleeps with a young actor, who turns out to be \u2026 but I\u2019ll leave you one surprise unspoiled. Lotto\u2019s story is fairly plausible, a life that might transpire in the world the rest of us inhabit; Mathilde\u2019s story contains more outlandishly fictional twists than those of David Copperfield,", "\u2019s Theo Decker, and Becky Sharp combined.", "Most of us live a life like Lotto\u2019s, even if we don\u2019t enjoy Lotto\u2019s privileges; we play the cards we\u2019re dealt, accept a certain amount of disappointment, and resign ourselves to letting many of the wrongs done us go unavenged. We aren\u2019t the stuff that crackerjack yarns are made of. But people like Mathilde, people who refuse to take things as they are, who insist on shaping their own fates because the ones they\u2019ve received cannot be tolerated\u2014people like that generate stories the way spiders spin webs. They need to see the world as directed by human intentions and actions because they intend to redirect it themselves. As Mathilde sees it, everything good that happens to Mathilde comes about because of her own dogged effort; everything bad (well, almost everything) can be blamed on someone, and that someone can be made to pay for it.", "As chilling as this sounds, it makes Mathilde exciting to read about. The most entertaining stories let us step into a universe in which the lines of causality are clear and subject to human intervention and control. But as Didion pointed out, a story is only an interpretation we impose on the chaos of our own experience, picking and choosing what fits the narrative we prefer. Each comes with its own comforts and terrors, its own insights and blind spots. \u201cFates,\u201d published alone, would have felt slight. \u201cFuries,\u201d published alone, would have seemed farcical. In binding them together and letting the parts reflect each other like distorted mirrors, Groff reminds us that while Lotto may live in a dream world, he\u2019s not the only one.", "---", "", "by Lauren Groff.
