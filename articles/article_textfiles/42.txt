Like the author of \u201cCapitalist Realism,\u201d Solomon is aware that Rockwell didn\u2019t \u201cmirror\u201d American life in any true way; his work was, if anything, a kind of funhouse mirror in reverse, turning a world that was really full of strange bumps and twists into something eerily becalmed and normal-looking. \u201cRockwell Land is its own universe, freestanding and totally distinct,\u201d Solomon admits at the outset. We think of his work as of the past now, but even in its own time it was out-of-time: Already in 1936, his editor at the Republican, anti-New Deal", "was fuming to Rockwell that the subject of his illustration", ", a glum, bony man trapped behind the cage of a window at a small-town train station, came off as too provincial: \u201cWe feel it would be more typical of millions of our citizens if he worked in a town of between ten and fifty thousand inhabitants and not such \u2018Mi gosh\u2019 and \u2018by-heck\u2019 surroundings.\u201d", "Solomon is a veteran of the artist biography genre, with books on", "and", "under her belt, and", "is a book of dazzling and accomplished detail about an accomplished but thoroughly undazzling life. The book spans from Rockwell\u2019s prehistory\u2014his artist grandfather\u2019s struggles in mid-1800s New York\u2014to his early attempts to define himself creatively in New York in the 1910s, through his long allegiance to such quaint bergs as New Rochelle, N.Y., Arlington, Vt., and, finally, Stockbridge, Mass., where he died a peaceful death in 1978, a certified national treasure at 84. For most of its 400-plus pages,", "tells the story of a neurasthenic illustrator who was almost willfully uninteresting.", "What drama there is comes not from the incidents of Rockwell\u2019s life but from how, in Solomon\u2019s telling, everything in his art actually represents its opposite. Rockwell created the imagery of the Boy Scouts\u2014his most lucrative and long-lasting gig was for the annual Boy Scout calendar\u2014but he was himself not particularly outdoorsy, a neat freak who couldn\u2019t bear to get dirty. He created memorable images of piety (", ", 1951), but his clan was uninterested in religion; captured scenes of scampy rebellion (", ", 1954) but was rule-bound and order-obsessed; and, most damningly, painted odes to family togetherness (", ", 1948) but was so affectionless that his own family despaired of ever knowing him. His first bride, Irene O\u2019Connor, divorced him in 1930 on grounds of \u201cmental cruelty;\u201d his second wife, Mary Barstow, was driven to alcoholism and finally the mental hospital by his remove. Only his third wife, Molly Punderson, whom he met when he was 65 and she 64, seems to have been a fit, and they slept in separate beds. \u201cAt last he had found his feminine ideal,\u201d Solomon writes: \u201can elderly schoolteacher who was unlikely to make sexual demands on him.\u201d", "\u2019s most controversial point will likely be Solomon\u2019s conclusion that part of the sexless character of Rockwell\u2019s oeuvre can be traced to his own repression, specifically the fact that he was attracted to men but unable to express it. While living in New Rochelle, Rockwell forged an extremely intimate relationship with the Leyendecker brothers, famous illustrators who created the proto-metrosexual \u201c", ",\u201d and were gay. Seeking therapy in the late \u201950s, Rockwell apparently confessed to having \u201coverly intense relationships\u201d with men, though he was so reserved, even in his private correspondence, that it is hard to know what he meant by this. \u00a0Piecing together the details of a two-week-long long fishing trip he took to Canada in 1934 with his handsome model and studio assistant, Fred Hildebrandt, Solomon comes to a suggestive dead end:", "Whatever the case on this score, Rockwell\u2019s detachment was not confined to his personal affairs. While his public persona was all self-deprecating humor and his illustrations usually had a jokey vibe to them, he could be extraordinarily, robotically cold. In the late \u201930s, he moved to Arlington, whose residents became part of his folksy New England cosmology. Yet when he moved abruptly away more than a decade later, in 1953, to pursue psychotherapy at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, it was as if a switch had been turned off: \u201cIf someone had been a very close friend, when Norman moved \u2026 it was as if they never existed,\u201d an associate remembered. \u201cEveryone complained that he never kept in touch. People said, \u2018We were his best friend, and now we don\u2019t hear from him.\u2019 \u201d", "Perhaps Rockwell\u2019s greatest moment of popular relevance came in the \u201940s, during World War II, when his \u201c", "\u201d became icons of pro-American propaganda, and his Rosie the Riveter suddenly gave his life-long difficulty in representing traditional femininity a national purpose in recruiting women to the war industries. Having already been doing covers for the", "for a quarter century, Rockwell was by then an institution\u2014but he was also becoming an icon of the past. Photojournalism was eroding the basis for magazine illustration as a vital profession, and TV would erode the basis of magazines themselves. Victory in World War II would make the United States a global power, undermining the hold that Rockwell\u2019s whimsical provincialism had on the national imagination,\u00a0though it admittedly had a long afterlife in Eisenhower\u2019s suburban \u201950s.", "Photo courtesy Christian Oth", "only gets truly interesting in its final fourth. Artists often have late-period turnarounds\u2014Titian going quasi-impressionist, Goya lining the walls of his house with nightmare imagery, Matisse breaking free of canvas with his luminous paper cuts. Rockwell had his own, and it took the form of a sudden and public turn toward liberal progressivism. When at last he cut himself free of the declining", ", he had the chance to reinvent himself, though it was too late to shift gears stylistically.

In its own way, it is as homiletic as his earlier work, but of a different world (partly because, Rockwell remembered, the", "had editorially mandated that African Americans only be shown in service-industry roles); it reflects news from his titanic near-present, not a transmission from a quasi-mythic past.", "Rockwell hardly became a political crusader, but amid the", "of the \u201960s he did at least speak up. In 1962, he became a public \u201csponsor\u201d of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, his name appearing alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. and Benjamin Spock on its masthead. He did a", "about the murder of Civil Rights activists during the \u201cFreedom Summer\u201d for", ", and even was made a lifetime member of the NAACP. As Vietnam reached the heights of savagery, he repeatedly telegrammed Lyndon Johnson, whose portrait he had once done, pleading with him to end the war. \u201cTimes are changing now, and people are getting angry,\u201d he wrote in 1965. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to get angry too.\u201d No comparably passionate statement appears in the first part of the book, where Rockwell comes across as almost pathologically disengaged. Still,", "doesn\u2019t exactly explain the change, just document it; Rockwell remained an aloof figure, closed into his own quirky world, until the end.", "Why return to Normal Rockwell, now, in 2013? That is a difficult question. Solomon wants to reclaim him as a \u201cpostmodern\u201d artist, but I don\u2019t think that quite flies. We are separated from his imagery of quaint civic rituals, small-town contretemps, and easy patriotic faith by Vietnam and Watergate and Stonewall, by Afghanistan and Lehman Brothers and WikiLeaks. The rage for \u201cAmericana\u201d that Rockwell fed in the \u201920s was, Solomon reminds us, a novel phenomenon of the time, an appetite created by a modernizing America looking for a simple and stable past. Similarly, she says, \u201cRockwellian\u201d as an adjective is an invention of the disillusioned 1970s. In art, we think of this as the period of post-minimalism and performance and the feminist breakthrough. But in politics, Nixon tried to name and speak for a \u201csilent majority\u201d\u2014hostile to the counterculture, pro-business\u2014and the coronation of Rockwell as an unsung American Master was a kind of cultural correlate; his art was populist and unchallenging and, after all, commercial. That touring museum retrospective that the", "article lambasted was, Solomon recounts, the creation of Madison Avenue dealer Bernard Danenberg, who saw a market niche to exploit, and pitched the show to the Brooklyn Museum as a way of attracting large audiences. Rockwell himself declined to show up.", "The right-wing activists who dress in tricorne hats at Tea Party rallies are, perhaps, the contemporary audience for a \u201cRockwellian\u201d myth of America, longing for a homogeneity that never existed. There\u2019s a reason why, when looking to deify Sarah Palin, a conservative fan would", ". Will such an audience want to wade through Solomon\u2019s account of Rockwell\u2019s life in its petty, oddball human actuality? Do they really want to hear about Rockwell\u2019s disdain for his hypochondriac mother, about his trip to England to secure a safe abortion for his second wife in pre-", "U.S., his dependence on pills to control his anxiety, his 1962 admission that, \u201cI was born a white Protestant with some prejudices which I am continuously trying to eradicate\u201d? Likely not, because to learn about the actual Rockwell is to undo the power of the \u201cRockwellian\u201d spell. As for the rest of us, Solomon\u2019s book gives us the set-up to a punch line we already knew. Rockwell\u2019s art is most interesting when he is least Rockwellian.
