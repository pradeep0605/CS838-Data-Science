{"Body": ["Mike Dawson", "Anna, the narrator of Lydia Millet\u2019s new novel,", "goes on the run from her husband, an Alaskan businessman named Ned. With her 6-year-old daughter, Lena, in tow, Anna stays out of the system, albeit not entirely off the grid, moving around a lot, laying low, and carefully tapping a modest family inheritance. By the time the novel starts, she and Lena have holed up in a rundown Maine motel whose gentle proprietor has a penchant for taking in strays.", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "That\u2019s a serviceable if not particularly original premise for what turns out to be an extraordinary metaphysical thriller from one of America\u2019s most inventive novelists.", "woman-in-peril plot at first seems to lack the confidence of its melodrama. Ned isn\u2019t abusive, merely cold and neglectful, and when Anna first left him, he barely minded the loss of his wife\u2014\u201cHe\u2019d been indifferent to me for a long time, as he\u2019s indifferent to most people who aren\u2019t of use to him\u201d\u2014or the daughter he never wanted in the first place. But then Ned decides to launch a career in politics, and since his platform features a Sarah Palin\u2013esque appeal to the \u201csanctity of every human soul\u201d and \u201cthe greatness of the American family,\u201d he needs to reassemble his own family for the requisite voter-friendly photo ops and meet and greets. Ned\u2019s slogans, Anna thinks, \u201cfelt like objects to me\u2014prefabricated items he had purchased quickly in a store, items he was busily stuffing into his shopping cart without close scrutiny.\u201d But she has no doubt he will try to find a way to force her to comply, and she soon learns that she has underestimated the extent of his reach.", "There\u2019s also another, more enigmatic storyline running through", "During Lena\u2019s infancy, Anna has an uncanny experience. Whenever the baby is awake, Anna can hear a continuous stream of words, a voice that has the \u201cappearance of fluency in all tongues and gave an impression of encyclopedic knowledge.\u201d She rifles through a litany of diagnoses and explanations\u2014psychosis, possession, some perplexing technological freak\u2014until she finally settles on the hypothesis of unexplained but nonpathological hallucination. The voice goes away when Lena speaks her first word, but not before Ned hears it too for a single, deeply unsettling moment. Furthermore, as the novel progresses, Anna discovers that the growing collection of motley guests surrounding her in the motel have all had similar experiences.", "This is the skeleton\u2014and no small amount of the flesh\u2014of a Stephen King novel. (Surely the Maine setting is no coincidence.) The coiling tension as Anna\u2019s efforts to elude Ned reveal his seemingly superhuman powers, the mystery of how the coalition of misfits at the Wind and Pines has come together and why, the intimations that far more may be at stake than just the fate of a single family\u2014all of these elements click into place to form a sturdy narrative engine whose momentum, however familiar it may feel, proves irresistible. It propels the reader toward the expected apocalyptic confrontation between good and evil. But Millet\u2019s fiction inhabits a different moral universe from King\u2019s. In his novels, the nature of evil goes largely unquestioned; what concerns King is the task of summoning the courage to confront it.", "uses the same epic devices to put forth a new idea of horror.", "Jade Beall", "Even when it\u2019s not explicitly religious, most horror fiction is shaped by Judeo-Christian mythology and tends toward the operatic. In", "anything overblown generates a pleasing friction with", "the dry, skeptical wit that is Millet\u2019s trademark. As soon as the story begins to inflate with signs and portents, Millet fingers her needle. \u201cConspiracy theories are a mostly male hysteria, it seems to me,\u201d Anna observes. \u201cThat style of paranoia isn\u2019t my own\u2014it has a self-importance I don\u2019t relate to. Even now, when I know for a fact I\u2019ve been conspired against, it\u2019s hard for me to believe in conspiracies.\u201d Millet has a way of twisting a sentence from the histrionic toward the blandly matter-of-fact that can be very funny. \u201cSo my fear has turned mostly to anger, which is much easier to live with,\u201d Anna reports as her conflict with Ned develops. \u201cI see now why it\u2019s popular.\u201d", "Nevertheless, Millet is quite serious with", ", and when she wants to, she can unleash a bladelike lyricism: \u201cWe watch movies, read books made glamorous by black-and-red palettes of horror, the hint of an otherworldly malice running like quicksilver through the marrow of our bones. We like to call the dark rumors demonic, like to have monsters to fear instead of time, aging, the falling away of companions.\u201d It\u2019s true, we have an insatiable appetite for end-times entertainment, where the heroes face towering threats so much more spectacular than the mundane diminishment that awaits us all.", "And yet, ironically, the world really", "in peril, its fate hanging in the balance. We are faced with a doomsday scenario that most of us routinely choose to ignore, as well as a drumbeat of lesser oblivions. (Several of Millet\u2019s recent novels have dealt with endangered species.) As a novelist whose central subject is humanity\u2019s vexed relationship with the natural world, she must find this blind spot perverse. Here is our chance to be heroic ourselves, to rescue the planet, or at least to make a credible last stand. Instead we prefer to stay home and watch other people battle a pretend apocalypse on", "So Millet gives us a new paradigm; her adversary isn\u2019t horror\u2019s usual bad guy, an atavistic entity hell-bent on destruction for its own sake, but the modern world\u2019s infatuation with manufactured, convenient sameness. The showdown still comes decked out in all the suspenseful trappings we love best\u2014a plot filled with surveillance and intrigue; a terrifyingly malevolent antagonist; an endangered child; a ragtag crew of brave resistors\u2014but the soul of humanity is only one modest portion of what\u2019s at stake. Her vision of the good is transhuman. In opposition to Ned\u2019s cold, hollow will,", "champions the fractal beauty of the chaotic and fecund, \u201cthe spirit and expression of all creatures and all people, their cultures and tongues and arts and musics, from the vaunted to the unknown ... what was organic and alive, the broad, branching tree of evolution that was history and biology and all kinds of astonishing bodies full of ancient knowledge.\u201d What does it take to make these things seem worth fighting for, you can almost hear the novelist ask.
