{"Body": ["Illustration by Drew Weing", "The first thing you learn when you set out to teach writing is that you will never teach anyone to write well. It\u2019s a cruel joke universities play on humanities grad students. As you\u2019re preparing to step into a classroom, they assign you an impossible task, one they cloak with a label like \u201cIntroduction to Rhetoric\u201d or \u201cExpository Composition.\u201d", ", they say.", "Staring your new charges down, you begin to speak. Your voice cracks. They see the fear in your eyes.", "In this light, there\u2019s something almost pathetic about most writing manuals, whether they\u2019re taken up as pedagogical tools or personal aids. Flickering candles in dimly lit rooms, they offer little assistance to those who are truly in the dark.", "This is the danger that looms over Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s", ". A marvelous writer, Le Guin has always been attentive to the minutest details of her own prose. In her fantasy novel", ", for example, she relies heavily on words with Germanic roots to convey the rawness of her windswept world. Attempting to help others write with similar skill, however, she too must reckon with the insurmountability of her task.", "\u201cThe important thing for a writer is to know what you\u2019re doing with your language and why.\u201d", "Based on workshops that Le Guin began teaching to \u201cwriters of narrative prose\u201d almost 20 years ago,", "\u2014substantially updated from its 1998 edition", "bills itself as \u201ca 21", "-Century guide to sailing the sea of story.\u201d It hedges its bets from the first pages of its introduction, insisting \u201cit is not a book for beginners.\u201d Make it past that initial warning, and you\u2019ll soon discover that it modestly aims \u201cto clarify and intensify your awareness of certain elements of prose writing and certain techniques and modes of storytelling.\u201d Whatever else it offers, it will not teach you how to write.", "It may, however, help you unlearn the lessons of those who\u2019ve taught you poorly. Le Guin repeatedly inveighs against \u201cfake rules\u201d: wonky, almost inexplicable principles such as the idea that sentences shouldn\u2019t begin with the construction \u201cThere is.\u201d Such arbitrary dictates are, of course, the creations of those who\u2019ve found it impossible to teach writing but been obliged to try anyway. I\u2019ve been there during my own time in the classroom, found myself offering shortcuts in place of systems. Fake rules are testaments to pedagogical failure, but at least they give you the feeling that you\u2019re imparting something, however false.", "Nodding to such encounters with the impracticable, Le Guin tends to offer rationales before she proposes rules of her own, and these rationales soon give way to something larger. \u201cThe important thing for a writer,\u201d she proposes, is \u201cto know what you\u2019re doing with your language and why.\u201d Unpacking that", "often means appealing to deeper principles, leaving writing as such beholden to some higher cause. Thus, for example, she asserts that it is \u201ca writer\u2019s moral duty \u2026 to use language thoughtfully and well.\u201d She\u2019s not speaking here of mere correctness, but of clarity, of the work we put in to ensuring others will know what we mean. And she makes one point clear enough: You don\u2019t need to agree with the exact reasons she offers, she just wants to ensure that you have some of your own.", "Ultimately,", "elevates storytelling above all other values. Setting it in opposition to simply \u201cgiving information [or] explaining,\u201d the goals of \u201cmost writing classes \u2026 in school or college,\u201d Le Guin declares it the first principle of almost all prose. \u201cThe chief duty of a narrative sentence,\u201d she writes, \u201cis to keep the story going.\u201d", "In Le Guin\u2019s hands, this commitment to narrative drive grounds critical judgments as much as it does a writer\u2019s choices. Sometimes it simply serves to explicate her other dictates, as when she explains that changing verb tense too often interrupts the flow of a story, pulling the reader out of its spell. Elaborating on this obligation to keep the tale turning, she writes, \u201cYou are the Pied Piper, your sentences are the tune you play, and your readers are the children of Hamelin (or, if you prefer, the rats).\u201d Every choice a writer makes, she implies at such moments, should be a choice in the service of story, not of some arbitrary rule.", "Le Guin\u2019s focus on story inspires some idiosyncratic observations. Poetry, she claims, can get away with stopping readers in their tracks, asking them to admire the elegance of its constructions. By contrast, prose (narrative prose, at any rate) cannot do so without sacrificing some key component of itself. Transforming this distinction into a critical guideline, Le Guin reads the work of other writers accordingly. While \u201cmany people admire the elaborate, ornate prose of writers such as Nabokov,\u201d she claims that she finds such language \u201cdifficult to get through because it\u2019s always stopping to be admired.\u201d", "If Nabokov demands that his readers pause, Le Guin\u2019s critique of him invites similar\u2014if subtler\u2014inspection. Here it\u2019s Nabokov\u2019s language that acts, Nabokov\u2019s prose that is \u201calways stopping to be admired.\u201d Contagious, that action, the action of stopping, causes its readers to stop as well, removing them from the story in the process. But even when it inspires inaction, prose is active, always moving, whether or not it is, as Le Guin says it should, moving on.", "In theorizing a necessary link between writing and storytelling, Le Guin characterizes the best kinds of writing as vital creatures that have something to say about vitality. Discussing how readers should approach the book\u2019s many writing exercises, Le Guin instructs them to \u201cmake each exercise not a static scene but the account of an act or action, something", ".\u201d To illustrate this point, and all those it subsumes, Le Guin structures her book\u2019s 10 chapters around exemplary passages\u2014drawn variously from the work of Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, and more. Above all else, these excerpts are reminders that writing is never its own end; it always exists to be read, its own actions engendering others, movements carried out to their conclusions.", "Photo by Marion Wood Kolisch", "In other words this book offers an accessible theory", "practice\u2014a theory of moving, flowing, going. Fittingly, then, her chapters cover fundamentally practical topics\u2014\u201cPunctuation and Grammar,\u201d \u201cRepetition,\u201d \u201cAdjectives and Adverbs.\u201d Writing, Le Guin stresses in each, is a kind of work, a work that is about letting the text do its own work, letting it breathe and grow. She emphasizes this point most clearly in her remarks on punctuation, in which she suggests that periods and semicolons, commas and their kin, are to a writer as tools are to a laborer. \u201cA writer who doesn\u2019t know [the difference between] them is like a carpenter who doesn\u2019t know a hammer from a screwdriver,\u201d she observes.", "The exercises accompanying many of these lessons are similarly plainspoken and practical. Most instruct readers to restrict their prose in particular ways: \u201cWrite a paragraph of narrative \u2026 in sentences of seven or fewer words,\u201d goes one. \u201cWrite a half page to a page of narrative \u2026 that is all one sentence,\u201d orders another. The directions are clear, but she offers only the bare minimum of information about how to complete them, often focusing far more on how to read and think about the finished products. Though her titular metaphor involves sailing, she repeatedly asks her readers to swim, knowing that they\u2019ll keep themselves afloat even if they have to flail. What cannot be taught, she suggests, must simply be done.", "Sorry, Josh, your essay begins talking about teaching college composition before slipping to LeGuin and fiction writing.", "", "-TrollsAreLikeSo2011", "", "", "", "And yet teaching still matters here, if only because it\u2019s so central to the story Le Guin tells. (After all, narrative prose serves storytelling first.) This must be one of the most idiosyncratic writing manuals ever published, the most personal, but not always the most personable. A singular voice echoes everywhere: Always unsentimental, she refuses \u201cto discuss writing as self-expression, as therapy, or as a spiritual adventure.\u201d Her chapters are jagged things of uneven shape. Some are brief while others are expansive, and some are gentle where others are tetchy. Some contain multiple exercises or examples, while conversational asides and short diatribes that she calls \u201copinion pieces\u201d overwhelm others. In the end, you\u2019re left with the feeling that you\u2019re dealing with a very real instructor, one who is by turns overprepared and distracted but who is always very, very smart.", "\u201cStory,\u201d Le Guin affirms in the final chapter, \u201cis something moving, something happening, something or somebody changing.\u201d In", ", something is always moving, something is always happening, somebody is always changing.
