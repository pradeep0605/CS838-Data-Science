What you cannot find is anything about Susan Orlean\u2019s diet book. In 1999, Orlean published", "with fellow", "writer Patricia Marx. After I discovered", "during a late-night Google fugue, I got a bit obsessed with it\u2014so I was delighted when Orlean agreed to an interview about her long-lost oddity.", "At first", "struck me as something I wasn\u2019t supposed to know about. The book sold poorly upon its release and soon went out of print, and it was easy to imagine that came as some relief\u2014at least to Orlean, who had used a pseudo-pseudonym (Susan Sistrom, her married name at the time) and appeared alongside Marx in the author photo as a petite, black-and-white blur.", "\u201cIt was almost instantly known that it was me.\u201d", "In the late \u201990s, Orlean was already viewed as a", ":", "came out just three months after", ", which became a best-seller, the inspiration for Charlie Kaufman\u2019s", ", and a new classic of contemporary narrative nonfiction. Marx has long written humor and style pieces for", "(her new book,", ", is in a similar vein), so the book seemed like less of an oddball entry on her backlist. But still, I snagged on this: What had compelled two female writers for the toniest magazine in America to employ their time and talent in the service of amping up already-deafening cultural messaging about ideal bodies and psychotic intra-female rivalry?", "My confusion only increased when my used copy of the book arrived, reeking of what I chose to believe were Virginia Slims.", "has a chatty, girlfriend-to-girlfriend feel, only the girlfriend is not an erudite pro journalist; she\u2019s of the arm-fat-punching, \u201cHAHA, OH MY GOD, I HATE YOU! JUST KIDDING! LOVE YA, BITCH!\u201d type. Some of Marx and Orlean\u2019s advice sounds like something your friends probably told you in high school: Hungry? Smoke a cigarette instead of eating! And some of it sounds downright psychotic: Tempted by leftovers? Sprinkle \u2019em with bleach!", "\u2019s Mary Elizabeth Williams", "and revisited the book", "after", "about discovering it earlier this year. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d co-write an advice book these days,\u201d Orlean", ". \u201cI think I\u2019d prefer really sitting around with my friends gossiping about how we feel about how we look, and not committing it to print.\u201d I had a few more questions for Orlean about the book, which she fielded gamely.", ".", "I was out to dinner with Patty and we were saying, \u201cWe should really collaborate on something.\u201d We were talking about how one topic that women know so much about is dieting. No matter whether you\u2019re the most advanced feminist in the world or not, it\u2019s just a subject that women tend to know an awful lot about. So we started talking about doing a book that would be a combination of humor and actually informational stuff that friends might discuss with each other. I was working on", "at the time, so my publisher didn\u2019t want to publish another book before I finished one that I owed them, so we struck this compromise that I would use my then-married name\u2014which would not be like a pseudonym, because it wasn\u2019t a pseudonym, it was my name. In a sense it was suitable, since it was so different from anything else that I worked on.", "It was a collaboration and Patty did a full 50 percent\u2014frankly, I would say she probably did a little more than half, to be really fair. But I\u2019ve always written humor, and that has such a totally different feel than some of the reporting that I do. I\u2019ve never found them incompatible. It\u2019s like, you play tennis and you go bowling. They\u2019re very different muscles, but I think it\u2019s entirely possible to possess them both. So it didn\u2019t feel incompatible, and to some degree it was like a palate cleanser from working on", "I didn\u2019t care. It was almost instantly known that it was me. It just wasn\u2019t hard to figure that out. The reaction when it came out, there was a little bit of confusion: Was this meant to be funny? Was it a parody, or was it real? That\u2019s a hard balance to strike\u2014to say, \u201cWell, the funny parts are funny, and the real parts are real.\u201d", "When [that piece] first came out Patty and I thought it was really nasty and biting and critical. Reading it again, I\u2019m a little bit less sure. Partly it was just funny, and people were speaking absolutely without filter, saying things that wouldn\u2019t be especially politically correct\u2014and these were very successful, accomplished women. Amanda\u2019s piece, on second reading of it, I had that same feeling of, \u201cWait a minute\u2014this is kind of jokey, and kind of mean and kind of just fly-on-the-wall and it\u2019s just hard to tell how seriously to take this,\u201d in that same way that the book had a little bit of a problem of, \u201cWell, where do you draw the line? How much of this is meant to be just purely tongue-in-cheek and how much of it is real?\u201d", "Photo courtesy Emma Dodge Hanson", "Public discourse has been amped up for better and worse. \u201cWhat does it mean to have two educated, progressive women writing a book about dieting?\u201d That would be this great topic of debate and I think that\u2019s exactly what happens on Twitter, in particular. Back then, it came out, there was Amanda\u2019s piece, and I honestly don\u2019t remember what other media we did. There certainly wasn\u2019t a huge reaction and the book sort of floundered for a variety of reasons. But there wasn\u2019t the kind of discussion that I think would happen today, for sure.", "I think women are so hard on themselves and in the course of shrugging off societal pressure and judgment imposed by society and men and external forces, we\u2019ve gotten mixed up about how it\u2019s OK to", "about things like attractiveness. I can very comfortably say that I\u2019m very clear about where I stand on gender issues, and at the same time I feel better when I like how I look. I mean, that\u2019s a human impulse. We\u2019ve made it really hard to know how to feel about it, and I think that\u2019s another case of women just being so hard on themselves. Even smart women aren\u2019t always quite sure if it\u2019s OK to like pretty clothes. I think that this book came out of that. Patty and I were sort of laughing at ourselves saying, \u201cCan you believe how much time we\u2019ve spent worrying about how we look? Here we are, people for whom on one hand you think that shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but on the other hand, come on, who are we kidding?\u201d", "I don\u2019t think we ever sat down and thought, \u201cWhat if someone becomes a bulimic because they\u2019ve read our book?\u201d I don\u2019t think we ever imagined that we were contributing in any truly pathological way. I think that somebody with a serious eating disorder would find the book really lame and levelheaded. I think what we were trying to do\u2014and you can definitely argue whether we succeeded or not\u2014was to be honest about what we saw. We looked at all our friends, who were all very stable, progressive, intelligent successful people, and they all, across the board, would admit readily to thinking a lot about their weight. It was almost like talking about money. The truth is, everybody thinks about it.", "To tell you the truth, it\u2019s probably more or less the same. I probably haven\u2019t varied much in what I weigh or look like over all these years. But there are different times when you think about it more or less. Your circumstances and your state of mind often have a lot to do with how preoccupied you are with how you look. If you\u2019re single and you\u2019re really eager to meet someone, you\u2019re probably going to think about it a lot more. I\u2019m married and I have a kid. I\u2019m not meeting strangers and hoping they think I\u2019m attractive\u2014well, I guess I do hope they think I\u2019m attractive. That\u2019s human nature, of course. One thing that I didn\u2019t think about that much 16 years ago was health\u2014in terms of thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be healthy and active and stay at the right weight so you don\u2019t, like, have a heart attack and die.\u201d I don\u2019t think 16 years ago I thought about it in terms of mortality, and I think as you get older that part of it gets added in.", "Right. That\u2019s why I do feel that it\u2019s sort of in its own way liberating to say to women, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel guilty if you actually think about this stuff. It\u2019s natural.\u201d When does it ever end, that women aren\u2019t made to feel bad about things that they think about and feel? I\u2019d like to look great and make no effort. But then you feel guilty that you care about it, and then you feel bad that you care about feeling bad about it, and then you just think, \u201cWow, it never ends.\u201d", "---", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
