{"Body": ["Photo by Chloe Aftel; Courtesy of Andy Ward", "Andy Ward has edited George Saunders\u2019 writing since 2005, first at", ", and now at Random House. On the occasion of Saunders\u2019 new collection,", ", Ward and Saunders emailed each other about writing, editing, outtakes, and how over and over again The Novel becomes a story.", "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but there\u2019s a story in this here collection, \u201cSemplica Girl Diaries,\u201d that you started in 1998 and finished in September of 2012,", ".", "Yes, and thanks for bringing up that painful subject.", "Hey, at least I didn\u2019t ask you when you were finally gonna write The Novel!", "Actually, at least three of the stories in this book were \u201cnovels\u201d until they\u00a0came to their senses. That seems to be the definition of \u201cnovel\u201d for me: a story that hasn\u2019t yet discovered a way to be brief.", "OK, but at one point, I think you said \u201cSemplica Girl Diaries\u201d was almost 200 pages long. When you sent it to me\u2014with the caveat that \u201cthis story has confused me for many years now\u201d\u2014 it was about 30 pages long. Is this normal for you? It brings to mind a story I once heard about Robert Rauschenberg, I think, who was asked, \u201cHow do you know when a painting is done?\u201d And he responded, \u201cWhen I sell it.\u201d Do you feel the same way, that you could keep reworking things forever?", "\u201cSemplica Girl Diaries\u201d was unusual in the time it took but not in the pattern. I\u2019ll often get stuck in the middle of something like that. What happens is that I start out pretty well and then \u201cfigure out\u201d what the story is about\u2014but the danger is that the story will just be about \u2026 that. So there can be a period where I\u2019m waiting for the story to hop up to another level\u2014but to get that to happen takes me a lot of writing.", "As far as Rauschenberg\u2014I have an internal standard for when a story is done that I can\u2019t really articulate. Maybe it\u2019s just: I know it when I see it. Or: I know it when I", "see it. It has something to do with making the action feel undeniable. There\u2019s a feeling I get when (in the rereading) the language passes over from language to action: What was mere typing before starts to feel like something that has actually happened. So that can take a while and it\u2019s not just about the language\u2014it\u2019s also a structural thing. If the story is tight and all the scenes are necessary, it helps me to understand what the current section is supposed to be doing\u2014and hence I can know when it\u2019s right and done.", "One thing that really helped on this one was your patience\u2014as we went down to the wire, the story still kept opening up and I appreciated how positive and supportive you were\u2014no pressure, all hope.\u00a0A perfect atmosphere in which to write.", "A lot of people say to me, \u201cGod, it must be so fun to work with George Saunders. Do you even have to edit him at all?\u201d And they say it like they assume you shun all editing, or don\u2019t allow editing, which is always really funny to me, because you are a person who craves feedback, who wants to be pushed and challenged and sent off in new directions. This all sounds self-serving, I realize, so I should add: Of course, at this stage, you don\u2019t need an editor. But you want an editor. Why?", "No, I definitely need and enjoy having an editor, and for the exact reasons you state. There\u2019s a really nice moment in the life of a piece of writing where the writer starts to get a feeling of it outgrowing him\u2014or he starts to see it having a life of its own that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with his ego or his desire to \u201cbe a good writer.\u201d It\u2019s almost like an animal starts to appear in the stone and then it starts to move, and you, the writer, are rooting for it so hard\u2014but may not be able to see everything clearly after working on that stone for so long.", "If a writer understands his work as something that originates with him but then, with any luck, gets away from him, then what he needs is someone who can grasp the potential of the piece and lead him to that higher ground. (I\u2019m aware I\u2019m mixing metaphors here. OK: One ascends to the higher ground, and on that higher ground is a sculpture of a bear, a bear that is \u201ccoming alive\u201d and \u201coutgrowing\u201d him. And the editor is encouraging him to \u201cgrasp the potential of\u201d the bear. Aiyee.)", "One of the things that you are really great at is simultaneously acknowledging the parts that are working and showing me to the places where the piece could be working better\u2014it\u2019s a genuine kind of encouragement that is literally \u201cen-couraging\u201d\u2014it makes me feel, \u201cOK, I can do this, Andy likes Part A and Part B, so I can go back to Part C and find a bit more in it.\u201d There\u2019s also a way that you have of being precise but also allusive, that works well for me\u2014it\u2019s something about the open-hearted way you frame your queries. Instead of feeling daunted or discouraged, I feel excited to give whatever it is a try. This takes a lot of editorial wisdom and confidence\u2014to know just how to get the writer to take that extra chance.", "It\u2019s easy to acknowledge that parts are working when the parts are working! I never strain to find passages in your work where I can write \u201cI love this\u201d in the margin and really mean it. But it\u2019s also freeing, as an editor, to know that your partner in the process\u2014the writer\u2014is so open to suggestions, and to reworking things, and pushing deeper into an idea, or a scene, that might seem good enough as it is. I never get the sense that you don\u2019t want to be bothered to make something better. And I often find that you have a pretty good sense of what I\u2019m going to say, anyway. Like, I\u2019ll put a note in the text that says, \u201cI\u2019m not sure this graf is working, or adding much. Cut?\u201d And you\u2019ll say, \u201cYes, cut, and I kind of knew it wasn\u2019t working, too.\u201d That kind of similarity of sensibility/worldview takes a lot of the tension out of the editing process\u2014which I always feel shouldn\u2019t really be a tense process if both parties are coming to it honestly and with good intentions.", "You and I have talked a lot about how this book feels a little different than your previous collections. The voice has maybe come down an octave here and there, the emotional stuff simmering beneath the surface is, for me at least, harder to ignore. Can you articulate why that is? Was this a conscious thing?", "It wasn\u2019t exactly conscious, I don\u2019t think, because the book came together over such a long time. It might have just been developmental: I got older and moved into a new stage of life. And in that new stage, things look different. But I think the most truthful explanation is a little more technical. I would come to some fork in the road in a story and it would seem that certain choices weren\u2019t interesting, in part because either I\u2019d done them before or had seen them done before. So in order to keep interested I\u2019d have to swerve in a new direction, and that direction often tended to be \u2026 (and here I\u2019m struggling for the word, so as not to sound full of it) \u2026 but maybe \u2026 well, I found myself trying to avoid what we might call the \u201cknee-jerk negative swerve.\u201d Or \u201cthe choice that indicates humans are always shit.\u201d", "I turned 54 this year and I find myself feeling like I\u2019m in a bit of a race to get down on paper the way I really feel about life\u2014or the way it has presented to me. And because it has presented to me very beautifully, this is hard. It is technically very hard to show positive manifestations. (\u201cHappiness writes white,\u201d said de Montherlant, who was, Wikipedia told me when I just now went to find out who\u2019d said that, a Nazi collaborator.) But I can look back at the way I thought and felt even as a little kid and there was a lot of wonder there, and openness to the many sides of life\u2014the way that beauty and ugliness co-present, for example, or the way that tragedy might be enshrouded in something really funny, or vice versa\u2014and I feel like I\u2019ve only barely scratched the surface so far in what I\u2019ve been able to write. And I have finally realized that, you know, it\u2019s not a given that my lifespan will accommodate my writing aspirations. It could be that it would take me 12 more books at six years each to get it\u2014which means I would have to live to be 126. Which I fully intend to do, of course. But it seems to me that there are certain thoughts and vignettes and attitudes that I have always had the desire to represent\u2014but that I\u2019m only now picking up the chops and/or confidence to pull off. So, good news/bad news: good news that I\u2019m progressing; bad news that life is short and art is long.", "Let\u2019s talk about nonfiction. I spent 15 years in magazines, editing stories, and I never encountered another writer who worked like you. Your drafts were incredible. You delivered a version of the story\u2014often a little longer than we\u2019d anticipated, but still: Jesus\u2014and a companion file of \u201couttakes.\u201d This file consisted of 2,000-3,000 words of perfectly polished sections you had taken out of the story, and yet, obviously kind of wished you had kept in. Otherwise, why the crystalline outtake file? What a beautiful system. So the process, for me, became merging documents, essentially: picking my favorite outtakes, and working them into the final story. How did you come up with that system? I noticed you also do it with some of your short stories, too. Isn\u2019t it hard to put something back into a story once you\u2019ve taken it out?", "It\u2019s a little like packing for a trip. First you lay out everything that might possibly be useful, with no thought about the size of your suitcase. Then, look at your suitcase. In the case of narrative, there\u2019s a certain obligation to keep the pace up and have each section or subsection be", "something. The ideal thing would be: no merely decorative sections. Every section has to (1) be good in its own right (funny, or sad, or fast, moving, whatever) and (2) advance the story in a meaningful way. With that criteria in mind, some bits are just \u2026 goiter-esque. Even if they\u2019re good. If they\u2019re not functional, they\u2019re optional.", "So with the", "pieces, which I knew couldn\u2019t be much longer than 12,000 words, there always came a draft of reckoning\u2014where it suddenly became clear that entire vignettes (which were actually pretty good, i.e., pretty well-realized) would have to go.", "Then usually just before sending I\u2019d cull through all of the stuff that had been cut, and start editing that as well\u2014trying to get each bit down to the bare minimum, or the essence of itself, so to speak. And as I kept working (trying to get down near 12,000 words) I would keep cutting from the good bits", "whittling down the rejected bits, thinking: If you guys are ever getting back into the story, you are going to have to be", "lean.", "So I would send you the outtakes in the spirit of putting out a fishing hook\u2014the ones that you would call out as being good or possible, I\u2019d try to work extra hard to get back in\u2014sometimes they\u2019d have to bump out some other bit. And sometimes you would say: This bit", "to go in. Or send the merging document you talked about. So it was a form of gut-check. Like, I could make a really ruthless cut", "I knew that you would eventually see the cut bits and call me on it if I was being too Draconian.", "Do you still get that panicky feeling in your stomach when you send a story to an editor?", "Yes, and I hope I always do. I think that\u2019s a respectful way to feel. A realized piece of writing had better be taking some chances, and since the end goal is communication, there\u2019s always the possibility that the chance you are taking won\u2019t pay off, i.e., the little leaps of faith that you\u2019ve programmed in might be wrong, due to some tin-ear syndrome on your part.", "Relatedly, do you ever", "know if something is good at this point in your career?", "I feel more certain of what\u2019s good, I think. Or\u2014I know the trajectory of my own work through the many drafts, and can tell as I\u2019m getting closer to the place where it will be as good as it can get. It reminds me somewhat of when I used to work in my dad\u2019s restaurant. After your 50", "dinner rush, you started to get a feeling for where you were in that process. It would be a total madhouse but, remembering the previous total madhouses, you could go: OK, we just have to hold out for another 15 minutes and it will recede. So sometimes in a story I can feel that it\u2019s not working yet but at the same time can feel it slowly moving in the right direction. And can have some idea of how long it will take before that version of the story will show its true face.", "OK, let\u2019s do a speed round. I\u2019m gonna throw out some topics and you give me 20 or so words off the top of your head. Ready?", "Ready.", "", ".", "A book, written at work, by a youngish guy just realizing that capitalism can suck (i.e., can \u201cplunder the sensuality of the body\u201d).", "The process of writing: Is it agony?
