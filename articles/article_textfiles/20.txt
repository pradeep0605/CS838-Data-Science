{"Body": ["Illustration by Ethan Rilly", "In Joshua Cohen\u2019s new novel,", ", a struggling writer named Joshua Cohen is hired to ghostwrite the autobiography of Joshua Cohen, a Jobsian tech guru whose vast empire, Tetration, was founded on the invention of search. The writer character Joshua is almost 40, which makes him a little older than", ", though both were born in the pre-digital age\u2014members, as I am too, of the generation that knew tech in its infancy, from that printer paper with the perforated strip down the sides to the \u201cInformation Superhighway\u201d to Mosaic and Encarta and chatrooms. All of which now seems inspiringly anarchic, if not downright quaint.", "is partly a history of how we got from there to here, and partly a warning about where we\u2019re heading: Tetration is an obvious ringer for Google, with a bit of Apple thrown in, and minus Google\u2019s loopy, good humored facade. After traveling to Palo Alto for some light indoctrination, narrator Joshua Cohen tags along with billionaire Joshua Cohen\u2014helpfully referred to, for comprehension\u2019s sake, as \u201cPrincipal\u201d throughout\u2014on a tour of Europe and the United Arab Emirates, getting the scoop on Tetration\u2019s murky origins and eventually too on the motives, murkier still, that underlie the reclusive Principal\u2019s decision to talk.", "At one point, Cohen has a character claim that, for a novel to work, its personae must be \u201cseparated into missing each other and never communicating.\u201d The problem is that in the present of \u201cpdas\u201d (a strangely dated term he keeps on using) and \u201conline,\u201d (which he employs as a noun, as in, \u201cthe original online\u201d) in which Cohen\u2019s own novel is set, people are never \u201cplausibly alone\u201d: \u201cEveryone now knew what everyone else was doing, and what everyone else was thinking, and the result was a life of fewer crosspurposes and mixups, of less portent and mystery too.\u201d The narrator says he recognizes the ideas in this rant as being swiped from the", "\u2019 website, although in truth it instead parrots", "by Toby Litt, which made the basic argument that, these days, Odysseus would just text his wife to say he'd be late and Bloom do his errands on Amazon, thus saving himself the trouble of going around town and saving us the", "and", "both. Litt isn\u2019t the only one to worry that, as what goes on IRL increasingly blurs into what goes on elsewhere (according to the San Diego Supercomputer Center, an average U.S. adult in 2015 is expected to spend about 15.5 hours a day in consort with \u201cdigital media,\u201d whatever that means), we\u2019re losing touch with certain things on which the novel used to depend: spoken dialogue (eliminated by texting), ambiguity (by Google search), fl\u00e2nerie (by Google Maps), ennui (by Candy Crush), or the surprise re-emergence of a friend or enemy (by Facebook).\u00a0It\u2019s true that doubt fades quickly with fact so ready to hand, and with it a kind of imaginative freedom on which some strands of literature used to depend. Chance is a hard sell when tastes and habits are algorithmically predicted in advance. (Customers Who Bought", "Also Bought:", "by Thomas Pynchon,", "by Dave Eggers,", "by Gary Shteyngart.) It becomes harder not to take a side, or to take risks, when everyone knows the sort of thing that will be looked at, what will be starred, or shared, or thumbs-upped. So whence the contemporary novel, then? What can it give that the Internet can\u2019t? Plenty, of course, is the answer, though to do so it needs to get out of that defensive crouch.", "is more like the online world than any book I can think of. (Without, alas, the cats.)", "Here is where Cohen wildly succeeds: There\u2019s nothing remotely defensive about", ",", "or about him as its author. In fact, rather than defending against the incursion of Internet culture on the process of literature-making, Cohen has invited it in for the purpose, it seems, of warning against it. His novel is loud and aggressive.\u00a0 Narcissistic in its snarl of nested selves, it\u2019s splashy with jargon and slang, fragmentary, unfinished, crude in its racial characterizations, heterogeneous, and hyperactive, with a porny gutter-brain. At 597 sprawling pages it\u2019s also huge, if no great shakes for Cohen, whose 2010 novel", "was closer to 1,000. Still,", "is more like the online world than any book I can think of. (Without, alas, the cats.)", "As with the Internet, it\u2019s hard to say what the novel\u2019s \u201cabout,\u201d or what its purpose is, or even if it has a moral center. A hyperlinked sense of distraction and refraction is built into the text, in Cohen\u2019s readiness to spin off on tangents from Neolithic goddess figures (there are pictures!) to the semiotic covalences of \u201cbuttons\u201d and \u201cknots.\u201d The novel, which incorporates interview transcripts, emails, an incomplete draft of Principal\u2019s autobiography (with crossings-out intact), Joshua\u2019s memoir-in-progress, and the ranting therapy blog of his almost-ex-wife, reflects something of what must have been the circumstances of its own composition, that continual immersion in anything, in everything, one ever wanted to know and a lot that one didn\u2019t that we can hardly now avoid. Here is the readiness of information to which we\u2019ve all grown so used, here is its kudzu-like spread, how it fills a landscape: \u201cThe xeriscaped rear descended into the vast gape of a wildlife refuge \u2026 originally a religion itself\u2014animism, totemism, dendrolatry\u2014to the indigenous Indians, whom the Spanish called the", ", or \u2018coastal people,\u2019 but who called themselves", ":", "= \u2018western,\u2019", "= \u2018people.\u2019 \u201d Cohen gleefully snatches at the low-hanging parodic fruit that is Silicon Valley\u2013speak, as at Principal\u2019s birthday party, where Joshua encounters a \u201cpornstached chillionaire and his two brogrammer friends \u2026 his coworkers at #Summerize, according to their shirts and shorts and hats\u201d who proceed to say things like \u201cYou can\u2019t change the scale without scaling the change,\u201d \u201cthis party\u2019s got mad fucking latency,\u201d and \u201cget positivized \u2026 the ad rep girls are 8s for def.\u201d", "Despite allowing for literature\u2019s infiltration by tech, yoking it to his plow as it were, Cohen is clearly interested in defending the novel as object, as mass of paper and ink. He sets his terms from the start: \u201cIf you\u2019re reading this on a screen, fuck off,\u201d the first line goes. Joshua Cohen (character) has had the bad fortune to publish his first book\u2014on the good old-fashioned, literarily respectable subject of his Holocaust survivor mother\u2014on Sept. 10, 2001. It fails, of course, and yet he keeps faith with traditional publishing, even while taking on work with the kind of online \u201ccontent\u201d farms on which many writers now are forced to depend. Joshua still reads paper books\u2014a lot of them. He doesn\u2019t have a \u201ctetheld\u201d (something like an iPad) or a \u201ctetset\u201d (iPhone?), he doesn\u2019t \u201ctetchat\u201d or take \u201csquares,\u201d and claims to quit \u201ctetrating\u201d (googling) one-fifth of the way through the book, even if we can hardly believe the same of his author. He\u2019s not a Luddite, but he\u2019s no technophile either; for much of the novel, he has no Internet access at all, and when he does he\u2019s mostly looking for porn. Which is to say that for a novel so steeped in the ethos of tech,", "comes across as highly tech-averse in the end. In fact, Cohen\u2019s narrative makes one wonder if what the novel wants to suggest is that the only way to live with integrity, to be full and truly in possession one\u2019s own human self, is not to live online at all. Or else maybe it wants to muddle the separation between human and inhuman in tech, between off- and online. Then again, it\u2019s not always easy to figure out what Cohen wants to suggest here at all.", "Still, throw enough darts and you\u2019re bound to hit something, and Cohen has a whole lot of darts. His sharpest ones are linguistic: He\u2019s a marvelous stylist, with a Pynchonian love of jargon and pun, even if sometimes his embrace of these carries him beyond the limits of comprehension. (\u201cOctalfortied\u201d?) But if the jargon is unlovely, it\u2019s the building blocks of sentences that are rhythmic and propulsive, full of alliteration and rhyme: \u201cMusings about museums, snarks about parks, observations to obelize: two frisbeeists freed from their cubicles\u2014a professorial but perverted uncle emeritus\u2014a Caribbean nanny strollering her employer along the reservoir.\u201d Gravel is like \u201cbabyteeth\u201d; welts \u201cpulse like stoplights.\u201d Voice, more than anything, carries the book, callous, intellectual, and excessive. It\u2019s the character Joshua\u2019s voice in theory, and Principal\u2019s throughout the huge middle section, but both are clearly Cohen\u2019s own in fact. Self-aware, hyper-articulate, and continually posturing, he\u2019s seemingly as at home in Hebrew or binary as in his never-plain-English, grabbing at any source of language with a magpie\u2019s glee, to throw it in his nest in a jumble: \u201cShareware soup, cybersalad of packetsniffed florettes dusted with a terabyte of truffles. Herbes de POP Palmiers. Tarte a l\u2019Terminal et aux apps.\u201d", "Photo by Beowulf Sheehan", "Perhaps this is a good time to note that I found the book largely unbearable to read. Not because is \u201cdifficult\u201d\u2014though it is that, at times, dragging along for hundreds of pages, and then flashing through technically complex terms and processes as it continues to burnish its author\u2019s already-gleaming bona fides\u2014but because it succeeds too well in making distraction and proliferation its game. It grows exhausting in the same manner that the unending tsunami of digital media does\u2014Look here! Look here! Look there! One longs for a prolonged gaze, for a pause in the continually scrolling onslaught. Too, if Cohen is trying to say that this stuff is us, our humanity, I would say his view of humanity\u2019s a little dim: There is here, as online, a great deal of vulgarity and hatefulness to wade through, from Joshua\u2019s blinkered self-pity after 9/11 (\u201c10 Arab Muslims hijacked two airplanes and flew them into the Twin Towers of my Life & Book\u201d) to his unapologetic misogyny and easy racial shorthand (\u201can Asian, an Arab, and an Indian, all speaking together in questionmarks like white girls\u201d), to the ickier porn stuff. Fine. The character is a druggy, drinky schmuck, heir to plenty of the same from Portnoy on down. But then there\u2019s that highly dubious, blatantly wish-fulfilling sexual encounter with an Omani woman, who Joshua\u2019s \u201crescued\u201d from spousal abuse (made worse when he gets aroused by the suicide vest he falsely imagines she\u2019s wearing under her abaya). That can\u2019t be pinned on the character. Compare this to, say, Joshua\u2019s talk of \u201cvessile women,\u201d which actually has a literary function.\u00a0 He seems to find a weird parallel between the women in his life and the Internet\u2014both, in his telling, storage receptacles for the self. An uncomfortable idea as far as gender politics go, maybe, but an interesting one in the context of the book.", "The novel\u2019s integrity\u2014like the Internet\u2019s, not incidentally\u2014may be buried in a lot of such muck, but I do think it\u2019s there. As Joshua learns more about Tetration and the dubious future of predictive search, government meddling, and \u201cmetadata winnowed to minilife,\u201d a picture emerges of online as an exteriorization of the inner self, something that makes not just one\u2019s own cultural past and personal present but everyone\u2019s at the same time outsourced, public, and searchable. Lured by the promise of self-expression, creativity, and intellectual freedom, we reveal ourselves online through our choices, allowing something as intimate as desire to be predetermined by a corporation, a search engine, a government. The readers are being read. Not just being read, but becoming, in the end, what \u201cthey\u201d think we are, whether terrorists, consumers, or reprobates. In a way, of course, writing does the same thing as this sort of online life: making public what is usually private and internal, sharing, over-sharing at times.", "\u201cClick until this page wears out,\u201d Joshua writes wearily, obliquely echoing Nabokov\u2019s Humbert. (\u201cLolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita.\u00a0Repeat till the page is full, printer.\u201d) Literature, even that of murderers with fancy prose styles, provokes rather than determines the agency of its readers. Freedom, where it exists in", ", is found on edges, places where the grip of online fades: on the beach, in mortality, in secrets, disappearance. And, crucially, in the text itself. Principal\u2019s chief engineer Moe, the Moses of this book of Numbers, is searching for a way to be open to experience, including online experience, without being fully accessible oneself\u2014to have, in other words, an equal amount of input and output. Which is probably what", "is aiming at too, as regards its relationship with \u201conline,\u201d using it and being used by it in equal portions. It reveals in the novel form a place where the making-public of literature proves itself safer and more productive than the making-public foisted on us by digital tech: Maybe this is the true Promised Land to which this Joshua wants to lead us. In that there\u2019s something about literature that", "freedom, that", "choice, however intellectual and seemingly inhuman it\u2019s made.
