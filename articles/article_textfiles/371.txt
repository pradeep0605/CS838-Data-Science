It causes them to undergo change, the kind of change that gives rise to wisdom, almost as a metabolic by-product. By book's end, soft bellies grow lean, flabby arms gain sinew, and once-narrow horizons get permanently and often violently expanded.", "Add to their number Joe Spork, the quiet, unassuming clock-repairer at the heart of Nick Harkaway's big, gleefully absurd, huggable bear of a novel,", ". When we meet him, Joe is a creature of distinctly untested mettle. Untested, that is, until the day he gets duped into activating a strange clockwork beehive that is either a doomsday machine or a device that forces people to be completely honest with one another. Of course, as Harkaway delightedly points out, to the British mindset, the two are effectively synonymous.", "Joe is promptly beset by veiled monks, sinister civil servants, and an infamous serial killer. Most ostentatiously, he must face the dreaded Opium Khan, aka Shem Shem Tsien, a possibly immortal, definitely voluble, downright Bondian super-villain given to boastful self-mythologizing\u2014and rug-pulling misdirection, as in this soliloquy:", "\u201cOnce upon a time, not so very long ago, there was a boy born in the nation of Addeh Sikkim, in the royal palace, who wanted nothing more than to lead his people into a new world of prosperity and hope. He was suited to the task: clever and able and well-favored.\u201d The Opium Khan looked nostalgic.", "\u201cI locked him in a steel box and burned him alive.\u201d", "Joe is a hero, though an unwitting one\u2014he remains in the dark about just what the hell is going on for the bulk of", "\u2019s nearly 500 pages. But every hero must eventually come into his power, the thing that makes him special. For Joe, this power doesn\u2019t reside in a magic ring or arcane knowledge, but in his family name; he is the only son of London\u2019s most notorious gangster. It is an existence he has flatly rejected in favor of a quiet, honest life among his flywheels and jewelers\u2019 loupes, but as his enemies close in, and the world may or may not be ending, he will tentatively reach out to that old life, and begin to tap into the vast criminal empire that is his birthright.", "Books like this, in which a vast, central mystery slowly comes to light, are beholden to their pacing. A Dan Brown novel, for all its globe-trotting, can feel like an Olympic biathlon\u2014lots of rushing around punctuated by periodic bouts of gunfire. But Harkaway\u2019s prose is playful and beguiling, with a keen satiric edge, and that makes all the difference.", "Harkaway isn\u2019t simply a funny writer; he adroitly", "humor to slide us gently into a given scene or character, and then invites us to settle in and root around a bit, the way you wiggle your toes once you've slipped on a\u00a0comfortable boot. The result is certainly not for everyone; Harkaway indulges a British fondness for hyperliterate circumlocution, which means even throwaway characters tend to sound like Pythons and a seduction scene can read like this:", "She rests a finger on his nose. \u201cHush.

I will explain that issue as we go. At the moment, I wish to hear your inevitable objection to the general sex part of this plan.\u201d", "See? Not for everyone.

But here, at least, the jokes land; more than once I found myself favorably inclined toward a given character, only to have one of those shaggy-dog digressions tip me the rest of the way over.", "Photograph by Rory Lindsay.", "Harkaway splits the novel's first half between Joe\u2019s present day and the Cold War era, in which a young female superspy faces off against the aforementioned Shem Shem Tsien. Harkaway is the son of John Le Carr", ", and displays what certainly seems like perverse glee in rejecting his father\u2019s affectless, bureaucratic take on the spy game for a defiantly fantastical one. It\u2019s fun to imagine the old boy wincing at a flatly impossible submarine outfitted like an Edwardian gentlemen\u2019s club, clockwork robots, and mechanical bees capable of perfecting the human soul.", "Harkaway has written a pleasantly roomy book, a grand old manor house of a novel that sprawls and stretches and invites you to do likewise on any one of its richly tufted fainting couches. And it arrives at a propitious time. The current publishing vogue for Nordic grimness, for austerity and efficiency, for tattooed girls who kick this or play with that against a compulsively readable backdrop of rape and revenge, has produced a raft of books that feel less like a manor house, and more like your first apartment: a tiny white room with cinderblock bookshelves and Ikea barstools of vaguely ruthless design.", "Of course, there are times when a crisp, unflinching tone serves a story, when fiction is a dish best served cold.

Antiheroes who reflect our basest, ugliest selves are thick on the ground, and that\u2019s unlikely to change.
