And she retells what clearly was a formative event in Plato\u2019s life: how Plato\u2019s mentor Socrates, through speech alone, came to be seen as so dangerous to Athenian society that he was put to death.", "What are Plato\u2019s contributions? Plato\u2019s own views are elusive because he never wrote in his own voice, only through characters speaking in dialogue. But just as we do not look to Shakespeare or Goethe for a well-defined political worldview, Goldstein suggests that the value lies not in Plato\u2019s particular proposals but in his questions and methodologies, the process in the dialogues by which ideas are considered, debated, and often rejected.", "The dominant character in almost all of Plato\u2019s dialogues is Socrates. He is hardly portrayed consistently across the dialogues, but we have several sources on the real Socrates, 40 years Plato\u2019s senior, whom Plato knew and clearly esteemed. Goldstein tells his story well, culminating in a moving and dramatic chapter, \u201cSocrates Must Die.\u201d Socrates, born in 469 B.C., was a self-declared \u201cgadfly\u201d in Athens while incessant wars between city-states were causing Greek society to self-destruct. Socrates acquired a vivid public reputation as a masterful debater who could poke holes in anyone\u2019s beliefs, while maintaining that he himself was sure of nothing but his own ignorance. After the temporary downfall of Athenian democracy and a takeover by the so-called Thirty Tyrants, the restored democracy put Socrates on trial in 399 B.C. for what may or may not have been trumped-up charges: disrespecting the gods and corrupting the youth. The jury found him guilty and sentenced him to death, and Socrates drank the hemlock that killed him.", "Photo courtesy Stephen Pinker", "Plato chronicles Socrates\u2019 trial and death in a series of dialogues (the", "), but can they be trusted? I think it safe to say that Plato despised Athens for executing such a brilliant mind, and Plato\u2019s Socrates is meant at least partly as hagiography. It\u2019s easy to get behind Plato\u2019s Socrates as he demolishes the confused, empty piety of Euthyphro, or as he makes a noble case for virtue being its own reward. It might have been less easy to get behind the real Socrates, who encouraged some seriously troubled characters such as Alcibiades (who was also one of Socrates\u2019 lovers) and the tyrant Critias. Goldstein does not shirk from that question and spends quite a bit of time on bad boy Alcibiades, who seems to have combined the worst excesses of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and George S. Patton in helping to drive Athens to ruin. Yet Goldstein argues that Socrates was ultimately executed because he deferred to no one\u2019s authority and tore down Athens\u2019 idealized image of itself. In the claustrophobic public life of Athens, Socrates was tolerated (barely) when times were good, but condemned as a dangerous nuisance when things took a turn for the worse. When Leslie Gelb, reflecting on the rush to war in Iraq, spoke of the media and foreign policy experts\u2019 \u201c", ",\u201d he explained exactly why Socrates (who, like Plato, never took payment from students) was so irritating to the chattering classes of Athens: He ruined their credibility. His message, paraphrased by Goldstein as \u201cDon\u2019t be so hasty in donning yourselves with laurels,\u201d fits America all too well today.", "Plato, then, took Socrates\u2019 critical attitude and generalized it beyond morality and politics to the search for truth in all its forms. Plato may lack the scientific trappings of Aristotle, such as they were, but he possessed one keen insight that Aristotle ignored, and, one that eventually proved crucial to the scientific mentality: Our senses lie. It is not just enough to question our received cultural ideas and our intuitions; the most self-evident truths around us may prove to be nothing of the kind. The classic example is, of course, that the Earth goes around the sun and not the other way around, something we now take for granted but which still goes counter to every bit of visual evidence we possess. The rediscovery of Plato in the Renaissance heralded the scientific revolution; perhaps a coincidence, perhaps not.", "Plato was a rich aristocrat set for life, but most budding philosophers are not so lucky.", "And since the more general revival of interest in Greek culture in the 19", "century, Plato has been taken as many things.

Instead, books and articles take the form of \u201cadvice,\u201d smuggling philosophical assumptions into their prescriptions for \u201cself-help.\u201d For Plato, this is backward, as self-improvement is what serves the search for truth, not the other way around.
