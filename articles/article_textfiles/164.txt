{"Body": ["Illustration by Emily Carroll", "For a considerable portion of the 20", "century, the funniest place in New York City was the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23", "Street. That\u2019s because for a long while a woman\u2019s lower leg was the height of sexiness. A risqu\u00e9 bit of ankle could lead\u2014according to comic strips, songs, and short films\u2014to all sorts of hilarity: goofy spit-takes and exaggerated rubbernecking from the lecherous men who spotted it, followed by those same men receiving a nightstick or handbag to the noggin from a disapproving copper or angry wife. And thanks to the location at Fifth and 23", "of the Flatiron Building, the wedge-like shape of which tended to amplify wind gusts and send hems a-fluttering, the corner was a prime location for such hijinks. Multiple funny and titillating short films detailed the phenomenon:", ".", "It helps that 23 is the funniest number. The numeral regularly appeared in titles of funny films (", ",", ",", ",", "), popped up in the writing of Dr. Seuss (\u201cDid I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave/ Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?\u201d), and had a cameo in", ".", "(In \u201cLucy Does a TV Commercial,\u201d the heroine gets sloshed while promoting a health tonic that\u2019s 23 percent alcohol.) Need more proof that the intersection Fifth Avenue and 23", "Street was the epitome of comedy?

Miller, author of the comic novels", "and", ", spent three years combing through show tunes, comic strips, novelty postcards, radio shows, sitcoms, animated cartoons, gag-gift catalogs, and various other doodads, dingbats, and thingumabobs. (Those nonsense words for nameless objects are covered in the entry for \u201cVeeblefetzers\u201d on Page 504.) The process might have gone to Miller\u2019s head: In the book he admits to amassing a fake vomit collection (fake dog poo is too tacky, he decided) and seeking out real Limburger cheese to see if it was as stinky as cartoons and comic strips had led him to believe. (Sadly, he doesn\u2019t tell us what he learned.)", "\u201cHumor tells us more about psychology than psychology can tell us about humor.\u201d", "In 200 or so alphabetized topics spread out over 530 illustrated pages, Miller pries open the kitchen cupboards of old slapstick films to list the detrimental effects of", "(nausea) and", "(head shrinkage). He points out the meteorological differences between briffits (the clouds left behind when comic-strip characters speed off) and dustups (the clouds that obscure comic-strip fisticuffs). And he pauses cartoonish rolling pins, grand pianos, and anvils mid-flight so he can scrutinize their physical properties, not to mention the various sounds they make when they eventually land on their targets\u2019 heads. Reading through the book is akin to spending a long afternoon in the dusty back corner of a thrift store: You emerge a tad overwhelmed, a smidge scandalized, and quite a bit wiser about things you never knew existed.", "is more catalog than inquiry. Miller doesn\u2019t spend much time psychoanalyzing all these jokes and gimmicks. \u201cHumor tells us more about psychology than psychology can tell us about humor,\u201d he declares, rightly.

More likely, argues Miller, such plot devices were an easy way to fill a half-hour. Was the dead-baby joke fad of the 1960s inspired by abortion fears or bloody coverage of the Vietnam War, as some joke scholars have posited? Maybe, writes Miller, such sick jokes simply \u201cexpressed a perennial urge to flout certain taboos as flagrantly as possible.\u201d", "Those looking for a more thorough examination of humor\u2019s underpinnings can turn to another new laffopedia:", ".

The intricately detailed and extensively referenced tomes are proof that humor scholarship has emerged as a diverse and formidable academic field.

And we may as well enjoy it while it lasts.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t shy away from the extent to which such zaniness was steeped in violence, misogyny, and racism. Celebrated", "humorist James Thurber, Miller notes, once quipped, \u201cEverybody will recall at least one woman of his acquaintance whom, at one time, or another, he has had to punch or slap.\u201d He points out that the original version of \u201c", ",\u201d the 1920s folk song that enjoyed a resurgence thanks to its appearance on", ", included the lines, \u201cI\u2019ve hiked and hiked till my feet are sore/ And I\u2019ll be damned if I hike any more/ To be buggered sore like a hobo\u2019s whore.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget, he writes, \u201cthat virtually every classic", "carton culminates in an attempted rape\u201d of Olive Oyl by Bluto.", "Miller doesn\u2019t celebrate the cruelty of such jokes; he simply aims to bring it to light.

As Miller admits, there\u2019s a lot of corniness he didn\u2019t cover in his book: blabbermouths, halitosis, lounge lizards, flagpole sitting.
