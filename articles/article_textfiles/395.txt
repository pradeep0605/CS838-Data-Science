{"Body": ["Photo by Mathew Brady via Wikimedia Commons.", "Imagine, for a moment, that it is 1862 and you are Gen. George B.\u00a0McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac, the Union\u2019s premier fighting force. The Confederate Army, led by Robert E. Lee, has just invaded Maryland. As you\u2019re preparing your strategy for checking Lee\u2019s advance, a message arrives at headquarters: A corporal from Indiana has found an envelope lying in a field near enemy lines. Inside are three cigars. Oh, and a copy of Lee\u2019s Special Order No. 191, detailing his invasion plan and revealing that the Confederate general has split his force in two, a daring move that has left his army dangerously exposed to attack. You\u2019re George McClellan\u2014beloved by your soldiers, tasked by your commander-in-chief with destroying Lee\u2019s army. What do you do?", "Smoke the cigars, obviously . But after that? If you answered,", ", you have a lot to learn from Richard Slotkin\u2019s", ". As its title suggests, the book sets out to show how the nature of the war changed during Lee\u2019s Maryland campaign, which culminated in the famously bloody Battle of Antietam. Up until that point in the war, powerful men on both sides of the conflict believed that a negotiated peace might be hammered out. But after 3,600 Americans died fighting outside a farming village on the banks of Antietam Creek, Lincoln would issue the Emancipation Proclamation, a radical document that ended any hope of reconciliation. In the wake of Antietam, the Union would fight an all-out war of subjugation, with the goal of crushing the rebellion beneath its Yankee boot and ending the institution of slavery by force.", "Slotkin, a", "and a writer of", ", offers an absorbing account of this evolution. But the central figure of", "isn\u2019t the author of the Emancipation Proclamation; it\u2019s a man who openly opposed it\u2014George McClellan. Vainglorious but insecure, power-hungry but risk-averse, a Democrat fighting a Republican\u2019s war, McClellan is arguably the Civil War\u2019s most fascinating figure and certainly its most frustrating.\u00a0In McClellan, Slotkin finds an embodiment of the thinking that Lincoln repudiated with the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, namely the idea that the South should be compelled to rejoin the Union, but allowed to preserve its", ". Unfortunately for Lincoln, McClellan was also the Union\u2019s best hope for delivering a battlefield victory big enough to give the president the political capital required to issue such a controversial proclamation. Reading deeply and thoughtfully through\u00a0McClellan\u2019s correspondence\u2014the general didn\u2019t so much as trim", "without first dropping a line to his wife Mary Ellen\u2014Slotkin paints a detailed portrait of the talented but flawed general who helped Lincoln bring about his revolution, if ever so unwillingly.", "So what", "McClellan\u00a0do when presented with the copy of Lee\u2019s invasion plan rolled up with those cigars? He first sent a few telegraphs to his superiors crowing about how he was about to deliver a decisive victory. (To Lincoln: \u201cI have all the plans of the Rebels and will catch them in their own trap.\u201d) But he soon fell victim to the second thoughts that plagued him throughout his career as a commander. Though he issued orders to act on the intelligence, they exhibited, in Slotkin\u2019s words, a \u201cbalance between boldness and anxiety,\u201d and failed to take full advantage of his remarkable good fortune in stumbling upon his enemy\u2019s plan. (As Slotkin notes, the discovery of Lee\u2019s orders was pure serendipity\u2014intelligence-gathering was among\u00a0McClellan\u2019s weaknesses.) Union forces won a minor victory on the strength of the lost plans,", ", but failed to destroy Lee\u2019s force, allowing him to retreat and fight another day (at Antietam, it would turn out). Despite the modesty of the South Mountain victory, McClellan reported it to his wife with typical immodesty: \u201cIf I can believe one tenth of what is reported, God has seldom given an army a greater victory than this.\u201d", "John Swansburg is", "'s deputy editor.", "Here, as throughout the book, Slotkin is careful not to use the benefit of hindsight to judge\u00a0McClellan", "harshly. He isn\u2019t convinced, as some of the general\u2019s tougher critics have been, that had\u00a0McClellan\u00a0acted without", "anxiety his army could have decimated Lee\u2019s at South Mountain. \u201cIt could be argued,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat\u00a0McClellan\u2019s caution was reasonable given his estimate of enemy strength, even if it is hard for historians who know how wrong McClellan was to accept that judgment.\u201d Partially as a result of his poor intelligence-gathering apparatus,\u00a0McClellan\u00a0had a tendency to wildly overestimate the size of his opponent\u2019s army and thus miss opportunities to exploit his superior forces. At Antietam,\u00a0McClellan\u00a0would convince himself that he was facing down a Confederate force of 65,000 men. Slotkin figures the number was more like 36,000.", "Though McClellan often seemed to be afraid of his own shadow , he could also be wildly self-assured, and", "captures him in all of his megalomaniacal glory. (McClellan\u2019s nickname was \u201cYoung Napoleon,\u201d but reading Slotkin\u2019s book I imagined him as an unholy combination of Alvy Singer and Douglas MacArthur.) \u201cHe would come to see his elevation as providential,\u201d writes Slotkin, \u201cand would interpret his successes and failures as signals of God\u2019s intentions toward the American republic. \u2026 He confided to Mary Ellen his sense that \u2018by some strange operation of magic I seem to have become", "power of the land.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s self-regard so grandiose it verges on treason.", "McClellan believed that he, and he alone, could save the nation from ruin\u2014both the ruin threatened by Bobby Lee\u2019s army and the ruin threatened by those in the Republican Party who would abolish slavery. \u201cMcClellan\u00a0was living in a military and political fantasy world,\u201d Slotkin writes, \u201cin which he was the central figure in a two-front war to save the Union from the Rebels in front and the Radicals in the rear.\u201d But rather than spur him to action, the fantasy only reinforced his trepidation. McClellan was loath to commit his troops to battle, Slotkin argues, for fear that a loss would give his political enemies the ammunition they needed to relieve him of his command.", "He certainly wasn\u2019t going to risk his neck to help a rival. To show us McClellan at his self-serving worst, Slotkin takes us back to the", ", in August 1862, in which Robert E. Lee badly outmaneuvered a Union force commanded by John Pope. The North had forces that could have come to Pope\u2019s rescue, but unfortunately for the soldiers being cut down by the Confederates, those forces were commanded by McClellan, who saw Pope as a threat to his ambitions. Despite repeated orders to reinforce Pope, McClellan dragged his feet, asking for clarification on who would be in command when he arrived on the scene. By the time he got his troops to the field, it was too late. Slotkin quotes Attorney General Edward Bates\u2019 assessment of McClellan\u2019s performance: \u201ca criminal tardiness, a fatuous apathy, a captious, bickering rivalry, among our commanders who seem so taken up with their quick-made dignity that they overlook the lives of their people & the necessities of their country.\u201d", "Photo by Bill Burkhardt.", "Why on earth would Lincoln suffer such insubordination? For one, there was a paucity of Union generals with command experience at the outset of the conflict. To paraphrase a confounding military mind from our own era, you go to war with the generals you have. The Union war effort also relied on a fragile coalition of Republicans and so-called War Democrats, who would have blanched at McClellan\u2019s ouster. (McClellan was well-connected in the party, and would unsuccessfully challenge Lincoln as the Democratic nominee in the 1864 presidential election.) And finally, despite his failings, McClellan\u2019s men loved him \u2014 as any soldier might love a general disinclined to risk his men\u2019s lives.", "culminates in a detailed account of the titular battle, in which McClellan finally committed his troops to an all-out engagement. The blow-by-blow description of the fighting may tax the patience of the lay reader; what goes by in a matter of pages in a popular survey like James McPherson\u2019s", "here occupies several chapters overflowing with carnage. (Twenty-five thousand soldiers were killed or wounded on Sept. 17, 1862, making it arguably the bloodiest day in American history.) But Slotkin\u2019s description of the battle is essential to completing his meticulous, maddening portrait of McClellan. Though he commanded a superior force\u2014and though he drew up a sensible strategy for vanquishing Lee\u2019s overtaxed army\u2014a tentative McClellan nearly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, ultimately allowing Lee to retreat back to Virginia with his army badly bruised but intact.", "Unluckily for McClellan, his victory at Antietam was just decisive enough to give Lincoln the political cover he needed to issue the Emancipation Proclamation and set the war on the president\u2019s new, revolutionary course. The victory was also just", "enough to give Lincoln the political cover he needed to issue Young Napoleon a pink slip and put the Army of the Potomac in the hands of men committed to stamping out the rebellion and the insidious institution it sought to safeguard. McClellan had finally gone to battle, and won, but the victory proved to be his undoing, not the coronation he\u2019d imagined in his letters to his wife.
