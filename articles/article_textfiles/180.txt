{"Body": ["Illustration by Cece Bell", "I discovered Anthony Powell\u2019s first novel,", ", in the nick of time. College was six years behind me, and the romance of pretending to be a writer had begun to pall. I\u2019d managed to complete a single godawful novel, a series of hopelessly inept, derivative short stories, and meanwhile I\u2019d been fired from one crap job after another. I was unemployed when I read", "that first time (I\u2019ve since reread it five or six times), and suddenly I saw my way clear to writing another novel\u2014which of course would turn out to be a bad parody of Powell\u2019s apprentice masterpiece, almost as unpublishable as my previous effort. But I like to think it paved the way to my becoming, eventually, a writer of sorts.", "Reading Ed Park\u2019s delightful foreword to the new edition of", ", long out of print in the United States, I was gratified to learn that he\u2019d discovered the book under similar circumstances: He too was working on his second unpublishable novel (which sounds rather similar to my own, or perhaps that was my third) and was persevering at a job that made scant use of his talents. (I don\u2019t know if he was drinking too much; I certainly was.) Mere coincidence? Hardly.", "is a revelation to sophisticated readers of every stripe, but especially to a certain kind of artist manqu\u00e9 on the brink of discovering that life is a more difficult business than he ever had reason to expect. Its young protagonist, William Atwater, has a terrible job at a museum that nonetheless affords him the leisure to recover from his hangovers and bone up on art criticism in the hope of getting a less terrible job. The subject matter is \u201crelatable,\u201d as my students like to say. Better still, though, is what you can learn about the craft of writing from this marvelous book.", "The first thing you should know about Anthony Powell is that his last name rhymes with Lowell: This will stand you in good stead when you press his work on friends, who are likely to have no idea who he is (much less that his name sounds like", ") unless they\u2019re from England, where most literate people know that he\u2019s at least the equal of his two great contemporaries, Evelyn Waugh and Henry Green\u2014both friends of his at Oxford\u2014and that his magnum opus is the 12-volume roman-fleuve,", ". Powell began the latter some 20 years after his precocious first novel, and when I got around to reading that later work, I was struck by its relative stateliness: Scenes", "in terms of fastidious nuance, usually leading to some grotesque anticlimax while the reader\u2019s patience is rewarded with the return of such recurring characters as the tippling Stringham or the striving Widmerpool\u2014the first a little tipsier, a little worse for wear, with every succeeding volume, descending in almost direct proportion to the other\u2019s irrepressible rise. Both, however, come to a bad end, and that\u2019s something", "has in common with", "and the rest of Powell\u2019s oeuvre.", "There\u2019s nothing stately about", ", which consists almost entirely of vicious little aper\u00e7us and an oblique style of dialogue that Powell borrowed (by his own admission) from Hemingway. Indeed, if you\u2019re looking for a funny, nonportentous Hemingway, then the early Powell is your man. He taught me that I was doing dialogue all wrong. People don\u2019t speak their minds or say what they mean\u2014quite the opposite. Everything is subtext, and the subtext ought to be revealing and", ". \u201cWhen I feel hopeless,\u201d an oafish girl named Lola remarks to Atwater,", "This exchange is not about Bertrand Russell; it\u2019s about the sort of person who\u2019s apt to invoke Russell for one reason or another. In a taxi with Lola, a little later, Atwater begins to feel depressed and worries that Lola will get started on Bertrand Russell again; later still, chatting with a friend, Atwater casts about for a way to describe Lola and mentions that she likes to read Bertrand Russell. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get rid of her,\u201d his friend replies.", "It\u2019s a good thing", "is so funny because otherwise it might well be one of the bleakest novels in the English language.", "And what about those aper\u00e7us? Taking a cue from Harold Ross, the great founding editor of", ", I often scribble \u201cWho s/he?\u201d in the margin of my students\u2019 papers, whenever they introduce\u2014or rather fail to introduce\u2014a new character. What does s/he look like? How does s/he act? (\u201cACTION IS CHARACTER,\u201d F. Scott Fitzgerald emphatically reminded himself.) What, in short, makes her or him tick? I sometimes think I should assign", "to each and every one of my students as prerequisite reading; among other things (e.g., funny, oblique dialogue), they would learn to fix a character to the page with wit, economy, and precision. \u201cHe was bald but seemed to be bearing up well,\u201d we learn of Sheigan, a drunken publisher, before he\u2019s allowed to speak; also that he has a \u201cblue chin\u201d and carries a bottle of gin. Both in", "and", ", these impressions are filtered through a single observing intelligence\u2014Atwater and Nicholas Jenkins, respectively\u2014deeply cynical if outwardly benign, and doubtless a lot like Powell himself (who calmly refused a knighthood, in 1973, because he found it \u201cundesirable for a writer\u201d). Tagging these characters one by one is the most important function of the novel\u2019s mise-en-sc\u00e8ne: They form, in aggregate, a terrible world. One needn\u2019t wonder why Atwater\u2019s museum job is distasteful, given that he works with a boy who\u2019s forever sucking on something mysterious and \u201cfarouchely clasping and unclasping his hands,\u201d and is pestered by lunatics such as Dr. Crutch, who appears \u201cwearing a mackintosh and a very silly hat.\u201d I love the way we\u2019re left to imagine the silliness of the hat, and as a writer I couldn\u2019t wait to use the word", ". I could go on: When Atwater meets Lola\u2019s roommate, Gwen Pound, he\u2019s reminded of a friend\u2019s observation \u201cthat she looked the sort of boy who might win a scholarship in chemistry.\u201d", "It\u2019s a good thing", "is so funny because otherwise it might well be one of the bleakest novels in the English language, right up (or down) there with, say,", ". The parties and bars and summer houses to which Atwater and his friends gravitate are repetitive, bibulous, and dull (to them, not to us), and for that matter almost all human intercourse is, let\u2019s face it, a waste of effort. Toward the end of the book, Atwater reflects that \u201cthe only time when he had been alive at all\u201d was during his brief infatuation with Susan Nunnery\u2014a sweet, wistful young woman who seems \u201csuperimposed\u201d on the dreary atmosphere of Atwater\u2019s life\u2014but of course love never lasts, love is utterly doomed, and Susan has run away to America with another man. Lest we miss the point of all this, a peripheral character named Fotheringham spells it out for us; it\u2019s the only long speech of the book, and it begins as a defense of \u201cfriendship,\u201d no less, before cataloging the various shortcomings of", "than futile, mind, and Fotheringham goes on like that for another half-page or so (\u201cwhen love has come to mean the most boring form of lust,\u201d etc.) until, at last, he drunkenly loses the thread. Whereupon Atwater reminds him: \u201cFriendship.\u201d", "Courtesy of the University of Chicago Press", "But I don\u2019t want to discourage you. Did I mention how funny the book is? Powell even shows us the lighter side of suicide (abortive), when a mediocre painter named Pringle, having caught his mistress", "with another, better painter\u2014both of them guests at Pringle\u2019s summer house\u2014decides to walk into the sea. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bad body,\u201d his mistress remarks, observing the naked swimmer from a cliff with Atwater. Unaware of Pringle\u2019s dire intention, the two pause to notice his \u201cpretentious side-stroke\u201d and the way his head resembles \u201csome curious red fruit floating along in the water\u201d before departing to cuckold him a second time. The gag is milked for more than 20 pages. At lunch the friends complain of Pringle\u2019s lateness before noticing his suicide note, left neatly on top of the cold roast beef; the gist is given in quiet paraphrase: \u201cIt said that he had been depressed for some months. \u2026 And on top of it all what had happened the night before. He thought, therefore, that he would not come back from bathing in the sea that morning.\u201d And how does one react to such a calamity, at mealtime, in the middle of one\u2019s vacation? As usual, I think Powell gets it exactly right:", "Finally there\u2019s the lovely clockwork form of the novel. Not for nothing is its final section (of three) titled \u201cPalindrome\u201d: Atwater is back in the same foul-smelling club where the story opened, and the same cast of characters (minus Susan) begins to regather. They are talking, as ever, of their friend Undershaft, whose offstage presence constitutes a motif of escape and illusory gaiety. As we learn at the beginning, and in almost every scene that follows, the jaunty Undershaft\u2014whose name suggests a tunneling convict\u2014has gone to America, where he plays the piano and dallies with an Annamite woman. In the final pages, however, Atwater hears that Undershaft has returned (he saw Susan in New York), \u201cpalsied\u201d with drink, and is now dating the Bertrand Russell\u2013reading Lola. Atwater has just missed him, in fact, though perhaps he can catch up with him at yet another party to which the group is about to adjourn.
