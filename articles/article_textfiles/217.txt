{"Body": ["Photo by Alfredo Pelcastre", "Humans are good at sensing invisible forces that give rise to the phenomena we see. Behind the dropped fruit, gravity; behind the stolen glance, lust. We may not know the precise formula, but we\u2019re familiar enough with cause and effect to feel when the usual rules are at work.", "We also notice when they are not. As readers, we may not even think about what normally shapes a novel, an ineffable blend of inspiration, imagination, research, language, and story. But let the book be governed by something weirder\u2014a constraint or chance procedure, something that makes the fruit fall up instead of down\u2014and our ears perk up. An extreme example is Raymond Roussel\u2019s 1914 novel", "generated via unseen wordplay, in which stiff human characters provide a frame for feverishly lively objects, like a weather-powered machine assembling a mosaic of discolored teeth. Detested by pretty much everyone but the surrealists,", "can hardly be called a good novel, but it does give off an exciting crackle of the unfamiliar.", "The young Mexican writer Valeria Luiselli\u2019s slim, unnervingly confident new novel is also about the life of objects, and of teeth in particular. Like Roussel, whom she name-checks, Luiselli has clearly produced", "her third book translated into English, under peculiar stars. You can feel some exterior force affecting it.", "Yet it introduces such an irrepressible voice, in the person of our narrator Gustavo", "S\u00e1nchez, the self-described \u201cbest auctioneer in the world,\u201d that you don\u2019t have to be a surrealist to appreciate this book. You can just marvel that what Luiselli calls a \u201ccollective \u2018novel-essay\u2019 about the production of value and meaning in contemporary art and literature\u201d also happens to be a genuinely delightful read.", "The plot, such as it is: S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez\u2014but let\u2019s just call him Highway, his nickname\u2014is here to tell us the story of his life, or more aptly of his teeth, inspired by a belief that writing a book is a great way to be able to afford dentures. (Don\u2019t try this at home.) An inveterate collector of objects, young Highway finds work as a sort of personnel crisis manager at a juice factory outside Mexico City, but in midlife he discovers his true calling: He becomes an auctioneer, training in the \u201cfour types of auctions: circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic.\u201d He successfully bids on a set of teeth supposedly belonging to Marilyn Monroe and has them implanted in his own mouth, only to later lose them when, in a moment of auctioneering hubris, he sells his entire self to his estranged son, Siddhartha. He then meets a young man named Jacobo de Voragine, with whom he collaborates on the text of one last \u201callegoric\u201d auction, a variety of his own invention, of works of contemporary art. There the story ends, followed by an epilogue narrated by de Voragine; a set of photos of real locations mentioned in the story, taken near an actual Mexican juice factory; and a timeline of real and fictional events in the novel, compiled by the translator.", "The narrative at the center of all this apparatus hardly makes sense in itself, you may observe. But Highway believes so firmly in himself\u2014in his own \u201cperseverance, discretion, and discipline,\u201d in his destiny, in the glory of his Monrovian teeth\u2014that it is hard not to do the same. Aside from his charming braggadocio, he has other fine qualities. He is thoughtful on contemporary issues of material culture: \u201cI wasn\u2019t just a lowly seller of objects but, first and foremost, a lover and collector of good stories, which is the only honest way of modifying the value of an object.\u201d He refers frequently to a large tribe of relations, including his uncles Juan S\u00e1nchez Baudrillard, Miguel S\u00e1nchez Foucault, Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Proust, Roberto S\u00e1nchez Walser, and Fredo S\u00e1nchez Dostoyevsky. He is endlessly digressive but, skilled raconteur that he is, ties up each loose thread with a flourish: \u201cEnd of declaration.\u201d He is an appealing representative of high and low culture\u2014a Baudrillard-citing guy (or, OK, S\u00e1nchez Baudrillard\u2013citing guy) who fundamentally just wants to be able to chew his food.", "Where did this unusual character come from? From an unusual writer, for starters. With her two previous books, Luiselli, who was born in 1983 in Mexico City, grew up largely in South Africa, and is now a Ph.D. candidate in Latin American studies at Columbia University, has demonstrated a cosmopolitan, quizzical mind.", "her first novel, entwined the American trajectory of the Mexican poet Gilberto Owen with the story of an unreliable young female narrator fascinated by him decades later.", ", a book of essays published simultaneously, addressed such subjects as urban cycling and a visit to Joseph Brodsky\u2019s grave in Italy. In a way, though, the subjects were almost irrelevant. What was interesting was watching Luiselli\u2019s mind strike the world and spark language from it: \u201cIn the small, rounded head of a child, gently resting against the window of a metro carriage, the crack of an idea opens up\u2014the fissure of a new word.\u201d", ", which is, like the earlier books, beautifully translated by Christina MacSweeney, shares those books\u2019 strengths, but its origins are stranger. There is, it emerges, a real juice factory outside Mexico City where the value of objects is implicitly up for question. The campus of the company Grupo Jumex, in an industrial neighborhood of Ecatepec, includes the by-appointment-only Galer\u00eda Jumex, \u201can exhibition and presentation space devoted to experimental art.\u201d It was, until recently, the only home for what is said to be the largest private contemporary art collection in Latin America\u2014surely, at minimum, the largest funded by a juice fortune. (Since 2013, the collection has also been displayed through a more accessible museum, in Mexico City.)", "Commissioned to write a work of fiction for a Galer\u00eda Jumex catalog, Luiselli found herself at a dizzying vantage point for this globalized age. \u201cThere is, naturally, a gap between the two worlds: gallery and factory, artists and workers, artwork and juice. How could I link the two distant but neighboring worlds, and could literature play a mediating role?\u201d she writes in an afterword. \u201cI decided to write tangentially\u2014even allegorically\u2014about the art world, and to focus on the life of the factory. I also decided to write not so much", "but", "the factory workers.\u201d To do so, she sent installments of the fiction from New York to the workers, listened to recordings of them discussing it, and continued the story accordingly. She also deployed locals to gather photos of Ecatepec, so she could locate the story among its landmarks. (Some of the locals, like one El Perro, made it into the novel as characters themselves.) Until Luiselli finally revealed herself, the writing was presented under the name of a man known otherwise as Highway: Gustavo S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez.", "This procedure goes far in explaining both this book\u2019s quirkiness and its very un-Rousselian eagerness to please. On one hand, the book features highbrow \u201callegories\u201d based on works by Jumex collection artists like Olafur Eliasson\u2014or, as cited here, Olafur S\u00e1nchez Eliasson. On the other, Luiselli is emulating crowd-pleasing serial fiction writers of the 19", "century\u2014her formula, she writes, might be \u201cDickens + MP3 \u00f7 Balzac + JPEG\u201d\u2014and so even those weird allegories tend toward the rollicking and personable. The Eliasson one involves an old, \u201calmost venerable\u201d rabbit named Cockerspaniel who likes to sleep in the sun; in the end, he is slain for dinner.", "If this book offers an allegory for the art world, what does it say? \u201cWhen the bar was starting to close,\u201d Jacobo de Voragine recounts toward the end of the book, \u201cthe owner would let Highway auction his stories. It was at Secret of Night\u201d\u2014a real bar, whose photo appears in the book\u2014\u201cthat Highway finally put into practice the now full-fledged theory of his famous allegoric method, where it is not objects that are sold, but the stories that give them value and meaning.\u201d", "Contemporary art can indeed work something like that: Objects gain value through the stories attached, and, as Luiselli suggests, they can lose value by leaving the museum to become just one more mysterious possession in a fanatical auctioneer\u2019s collection. In", "the stories that Luiselli has attached to the people, buildings, and companies of Ecatepec alter their value, touching them with the glow of literary inspiration. At the same time, she pulls revered artists and writers out of the museum and the library, recycling them as characters, even metaphorically adopting them as relatives.", "In her blend of truth and fiction, in her tinkering with the value of art and its makers, Luiselli becomes a kind of auctioneer herself. She might even reach the high standard of Gustavo S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez, who on his deathbed leaves a note to his son full of characteristically humane bluster. Siddhartha can keep his beloved Marilyn Monroe teeth, Highway writes. They \u201cwere false anyway.\u201d", "", "---", "by Valeria Luiselli, translated by Christina MacSweeney.
