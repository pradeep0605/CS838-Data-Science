What these books share is a deep love of the written word and a belief that \u201ca book can insert itself into a reader\u2019s own history, into a reader\u2019s own life story, until it\u2019s hard to know what one would be without it,\u201d Mead says.

There\u2019s no fighting or shrugging off her identification with the book, even if the relationship is complex. Instead, the book is always there for her and, with each revisit to Eliot\u2019s imaginary 1830s Everytown, there are new notes to discover under the surface.

It\u2019s murky territory, if not downright frowned upon, to get too mired in the biography of a writer in an attempt to get closer to a beloved book. Literature students are taught that work should stand on its own, and meaning shouldn\u2019t be extracted outside of a book\u2019s cover. But as a reader, I\u2019ve never been able to shut down my interest in a favorite writer\u2019s life or my interest in the circumstances behind the act of creation of a work I love. As early as middle school, I remember tracking down a biography of J.R.R. Tolkien after tearing through", ", and then it was Lewis Carroll biographies in high school. Over the last few years my reading habits have turned into real-life adventures, traveling to writers\u2019 houses across the country and in the U.K., trying to pin down why such places are preserved and beloved. Mead can\u2019t let her favorite author or the author\u2019s houses alone either, though she is carefully aware of the skepticism that will greet such an endeavor.", "Photo by Elisabeth C. Prochnik", "On her visit to Eliot\u2019s childhood home, Griff House, Mead explains, \u201cVisiting the former homes of famous writers tends to be a compromised and often unsatisfying endeavor; by contrast with a painter\u2019s studio, the nature of literary creativity is not easily suggested by the site of creation.\u201d She recognizes her mission has a \u201cquasi-objective spirit of inquiry\u201d because of her personal investment in the novel. She hints that even Eliot herself might have skepticism about Mead\u2019s passion for the novel. After the publication of", "Eliot received letters from women who identified so closely to Dorothea and her poorly matched marriage that they believed her character had been modeled on them. Mead points out that \u201csuch an approach to fiction\u2014where do I see myself in here?\u2014is not how a scholar reads, and it can be limiting in its solipsism.\u201d", "Eliot \u201cscorned women readers who imagined themselves the heroines of French novels,\u201d and questioned the legitimacy of literary tourism as well. On her own journey to Friedrich Schiller\u2019s home in Weimar, Germany, Eliot remarked on the \u201cstupidity of people tricking out and altering such a place instead of letting one see it as he saw it and lived in it.\u201d", "And yet Mead is pulled to Eliot\u2019s landmarks anyway, though skeptical at first. As she tours the much-changed Griff House, she observes, \u201cIt felt ridiculous to be wandering these rooms, trying to ignore the glowing fire-escape signs and the soft rock on the sound system, and attempting to imagine the house as it was.\u201d But after many visits and tours of landmarks in \u201c", ",\u201d Mead comes full circle to the value of what\u2019s around her\u2014and it\u2019s at Eliot\u2019s home Brookbank, where the author wrote", "that Mead allows her imagination to transform her experience. Looking out the same window Eliot gazed out of, Mead sees her favorite author. \u201cI could imagine her there: I could conjure her more vividly than anywhere else I had pictured her in my travels.\u201d", "Along her journey, Mead gives readers a full picture of Eliot\u2019s own incredible life. Eliot forged an editorial career for herself before writing her novels and fought for a full and rich (and scandalous) love life, despite being ridiculed by literary high society, including Henry James, for her homely looks. She lost her family\u2019s support for entering into a long-term relationship with George Henry Lewes, a cuckolded but still-married man, who generously raised and gave his name to his wife\u2019s three sons from another man.", "Who knew Eliot\u2019s life was so deliciously complicated? It\u2019s a downright departure from her forebear-novelists, the Bront\u00ebs and Ms. Austen, who were mostly bound to the home, their words escapes from parlor-room domesticity. Eliot was a pioneering career gal, and Mead, inspired by Eliot in forging her own journalism career, looks repeatedly to the characters in", "for insight into her own work and love life, with varying success. First, she notes her relationship with a much older scholarly man, which vaguely mirrors the relationship between Dorothea and Casaubon, but her lover comes with a young daughter and Mead comes up empty-handed when mining the text for advice on the complexity of her situation. Later, Mead marries a man with three sons, which parallels Eliot\u2019s unconventional relationship with Lewes and his three boys. During her introduction to the family, Mead recalls Dorothea\u2019s words about \u201cthe need for patience with young men\u2014who may seem idle and weak because they are growing.\u201d", "These personal connections notwithstanding, Mead\u2019s relationship to", "is deeply intellectual. Indeed, Mead keeps her journalistic inquiry at arm\u2019s length when it comes to discussion of her own upbringing, love affairs, and career decisions.
