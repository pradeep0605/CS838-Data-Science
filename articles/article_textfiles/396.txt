The tale, of course, is about itself: Grover, fresh from the nightmare of", ", cooks up a half-dozen schemes to prevent the reader from turning pages to get to the promised fright at the end. (Spoiler alert: In a Shyamalanian twist, the monster is, once again, Grover himself.) In the sequel, Grover is joined by Elmo\u2014a casting move nakedly designed to appeal to a younger demo\u2014who, eager to meet the monster, encourages us to subvert all of Grover\u2019s defenses.", "The iPad version is animated and interactive. Grover keeps begging us not to turn the page in his real whiny-gravelly voice. To help Elmo get to the end, you\u2019ve got to swipe away the paper clips, glue, and alphabet blocks that Grover puts up to block each page. At first, this is delightful; when I offered the app to my 19-month-old son Khalil, he was instantly smitten. But as I watched him play with", ", I began to wonder what was really going on.", "When a young reader engages with the", "app, what is he doing? Is he reading a book? Playing a video game? Watching TV? It\u2019s hard to say. Grover and Elmo are animated television characters appearing on an iPad screen, thanks to an app that works like a game but calls itself a book. Indeed, the entire narrative is", "the physicality of books;", "only makes sense if young readers imagine that they\u2019re looking at a static, print-bound item that\u2019s somehow embedded within a digital experience. That\u2019s what I mean about mind-bending. With its various forms of nested media,", "is like Borges for the under-5 set.", "The", "app is an extreme example of what I\u2019ve found to be a common problem with children\u2019s books made for the iPad. They offer too many different kinds of experiences, becoming muddled in the process\u2014and, more importantly, missing the point of children\u2019s books, which is to get kids excited about reading.", "I didn\u2019t expect to feel this way. In raising Khalil, my wife and I have been liberal about technology.", "that doctors\u2019 absolute prohibition against television for toddlers is too rigid. The iPad, meanwhile, has become one of Khalil\u2019s favorite toys. He also loves phones, remotes, computers, and TVs, but the iPad is the one grown-up gadget I feel comfortable letting him play with for an extended period of time. It can\u2019t break as easily as a phone, he can\u2019t make stray calls, and the large screen is easy on his fingers and his eyes. Plus, there are lots of educational games available for the device, and it\u2019s a good way for him to watch", "in bed.", "But Khalil also loves books. My wife has plied him with board books since he was born, and now he\u2019ll bring us his favorite titles\u2014", ",", ",", "\u2014several times a day, demanding that we read to him with his universal call to action, \u201cMore!\u201d Recently we went on a vacation to South Africa, a trip that involved a total of about 48 hours in a plane. We brought along a handful of Khalil\u2019s favorite books, but given how much we already had to pack, the trip seemed like an opportunity to test out books created for the iPad. (Plus, as I pointed out recently,", "myself.) Along with", ", I bought an app that collects", "; a celebrated and well-designed book called", "; a Kindle book about birds; and", ", an iPad bookstore that sells hundreds of touch-based kid titles. I expected these iPad books to become the star of the trip. But as soon as Khalil began using them, it was obvious they couldn\u2019t match their paper-based cousins.", "One problem is that iPad books had a hard time holding Khalil\u2019s attention. When kids look at a screen, they seem to expect to see movement. These iPad books offer some animation\u2014in the more sophisticated titles the characters move around the screen, while others show Ken Burns-style pan-and-zooms over static images\u2014but they\u2019re not nearly as dynamic as cartoons. The stop-start motion seemed to confuse Khalil; whenever the action paused, he thought the video was over, and he\u2019d press the iPad\u2019s Home button to get to something else. Even when we guided him through a book\u2014for instance, helping him swipe his finger to wipe away the glue Grover splashes to get us not to turn the page\u2014Khalil was rarely content to stick with the book. The Home button, the doorway to the iPad\u2019s many splendors, was always more interesting. (The other major hassle to some of these books: They\u2019re not coded to be interrupted, so when you click away to the Home screen and then go back to the app, the book starts all over again.)", "Now, physical books don\u2019t always hold a", "span either. Khalil will often hand me a book, then walk away to get another one just as I\u2019m getting into the meat of the story. Other times he\u2019ll protest my linearity\u2014he likes the part of", "where the bear wakes up with a thunderous sneeze, so if I start at the beginning, he\u2019ll usually pull the book away and correct me. Yet even when he loses interest in the content of a book, Khalil is still fascinated by the book as an object. Give him any book and he\u2019ll be captivated by the way the pages feel and how they turn to reveal new stuff.", "I suspect that this is an important advantage books have over booklike apps. To a kid, a physical book is much more versatile, and ironically more interactive, than a tablet\u2014you can open it to any page, you can drop it or bang on it or step on it, you can draw on it, you can rip out a page and tear it and crumple it up. In this way, a shelf of books can be endlessly fun\u2014by which I mean at least many minutes of fun. On an iPad, meanwhile, a shelf of books represent just a few apps out of thousands, none of them as compelling as warping your own face in Photo Booth.", "Perhaps that explains why designers tart up these apps with so many multimedia baubles\u2014the talking characters, the interactive puzzles, the animation. But I\u2019m deeply suspicious of this flashy approach.", "of getting young children interested in books\u2014of reading to and along with them\u2014is to encourage them to think of books, and by extension", ", as a source of wonder. To the extent that these apps achieve that, it\u2019s only through trickery\u2014the trick of taking a video game or a cartoon and pretending it\u2019s a book just because it\u2019s surrounded by \u201cpages.\u201d Yet those insistent design elements (like page-turning animations) meant to mimic physical books all serve to remind me how unbooklike the app really is.", "They are also deceptive to children, and they don\u2019t advance the goal of reading. I have nothing against video games or TV, but I do want Khalil to be able to distinguish those visually dynamic media as being distinct from text. It\u2019s possible such divisions won\u2019t be necessary in the future\u2014maybe when Khalil is my age all books will be a combination of text and puzzles and animation, god help us all. For the foreseeable future, though, books and video games are different, and they\u2019re supposed to be different. I don\u2019t see any reason to conflate the two in Khalil\u2019s mind, especially when he\u2019s so perfectly happy reading good old static books.", "Now, you might argue that if Khalil is using his print books as hats or projectiles or cudgels with which to beat his stuffed animals, he\u2019s not getting much out of them, either. But I\u2019m more optimistic. If \u201creading\u201d for Khalil involves three minutes of pushing through the narrative reading punctuated by two minutes of using the book for peekaboo, I\u2019m willing to accept that. It\u2019s better than a book that functions as a hybrid between a video game and a TV show, and which forgets about imagination and the virtues of textual narrative in the process.
