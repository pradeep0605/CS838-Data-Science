{"Body": ["Illustration by Sean Ford.", "We\u2019re accustomed, in mysteries, to our detectives facing long odds. It\u2019s what makes us cheer for them to crack the case: not just because we want to see justice done, or because we need to know whodunit, but because the powerful forces arrayed against one little investigator inspire our empathy, reminding us of the times we\u2019ve felt the agents of the universe lining up to kick us in the shins. Think of Easy Rawlins, a black man in midcentury Los Angeles, forever harassed by the police. Or Philip Marlowe, talking his way out of frame job after frame job.

Winters\u2019 sharp, funny, and deeply wise", ". Palace may be investigating the death of a dull insurance man found in the bathroom of what used to be a McDonald\u2019s one cold March morning, but he knows his detective work doesn\u2019t really matter. After all, by October he\u2019ll be dead. So will everyone in snowy Concord, everyone in New Hampshire, everyone in America, and everyone in the world. A six-kilometer-wide asteroid is bearing down, and it\u2019s got a 100 percent chance of striking the Earth. Odds don\u2019t get much longer than that.", "In the face of certain destruction, some American institutions are holding up better than others. McDonald\u2019s, 7-Eleven, and Dunkin\u2019 went bankrupt in the market panic that followed news of the asteroid\u2019s flight path. (Panera survives, although the owners \u201chave undergone a meaningful spiritual experience and restaffed most of the restaurants with coreligionists, so it\u2019s not worth going in there unless you want to hear the Good News.\u201d) Cellphone service is getting spottier and spottier as towers go unmaintained, the telecom employees cashing out and \u201cgoing Bucket List.\u201d The Concord schools, on the other hand, have remained open, a dedicated staff continuing to teach quarter-full classrooms.", "The PD is doing pretty well, considering; they\u2019ve lost a few to early retirement and suicide, but funding is up and habeas corpus has been suspended\u2014for drug dealers at least\u2014thanks to the Impact Preparation Security and Stabilization Act. It\u2019s just that no one really cares about solving murders when you\u2019re busy Preparing for Impact. And how, exactly, do you Prepare? One of Palace\u2019s colleagues likes to say that \u201csometime around late September they\u2019ll start handing out umbrellas.\u201d", "That deadpan voice seems to be going around, as genial fatalism rules the day now that the chaos immediately surrounding the initial announcement has calmed.

(In the Midwest, they prefer shotguns to the head, but Concord\u2019s \u201ca hanger town.\u201d) Nevertheless, Palace thinks something\u2019s fishy about the death, and he pursues the case in the face of everyone else\u2019s disbelief and disinterest. The victim\u2019s relatives don\u2019t care about Palace\u2019s theories. The scumbags he shakes down for information are mostly exasperated by his diligence: \u201cYou know, a lot of cops are quitting,\u201d one says. \u201cMoving to Jamaica and so forth. Did you ever think about that, Palace?\u201d Even when Palace turns up evidence that Fell may have been wrapped up in something big, his colleagues treat him like an overeager kid. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d cracks the assistant D.A. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it an attempted murder. It\u2019s a suicide, but you\u2019re attempting to make it a murder.\u201d", "What makes Palace such a fine hero is that despite the slim hopes for his case and the slimmer hopes for the planet itself, he gets to work\u2014following his hunches and utilizing the skills he\u2019s been honing his whole life. The do-right son of a professor\u2014he jots down his investigative notes in the exam bluebooks he found in the attic after his dad\u2019s death\u2014Palace has always wanted to be a detective, and the fact that he\u2019s won the job in the last days of everything doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not going to do the job right. He sees something of himself in Fell, \u201ca born actuary,\u201d in the words of his boss, so organized he alphabetized his cereal boxes. It\u2019s clear Palace feels that declaring Fell, peremptorily, a suicide, disrespects all the guys like him who\u2019d never do something like that.", "Winters\u2019 plotting is sure-footed and surprising;", ", reportedly the first of a trilogy, is satisfying while still leaving plenty of questions unanswered.
