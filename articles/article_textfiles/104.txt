In his new novel", ", you know where you are before you\u2019ve even had a chance to ask, thanks to the book\u2019s first sentence: \u201c", "\u201d As an opening gambit, it presents a compressed essence of its author\u2019s stylistic and thematic dispositions: the merging concerns with capitalism and catastrophe; the post-religious eschatology; the stylistic signature of declaratory evasiveness, of plainspoken ambiguity.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "The man who speaks these first words is named Ross Lockhart, a billionaire in his 60s who originally got rich off \u201canalyzing the profit impact of natural disasters\u201d\u2014the sort of honest days\u2019 work your standard DeLillo character has long tended to favor. Lockhart\u2019s words are recalled by his aimless son Jeff, our narrator, as he\u2019s chauffeured in an armored vehicle across the plains of Kyrgyzstan toward a secretive compound in which his terminally ill stepmother Artis is soon to be suspended in a cryonics pod, in the hope of eventual resurrection by scientists of the future. We\u2019re barely a chapter into this thing, in other words, and we are already deep in DeLillo country.", "Death and technology have, for decades now, been converging concerns in DeLillo\u2019s fiction. \u201cThis is the whole point of technology,\u201d as one character puts it in 1984\u2019s", ". \u201cIt creates an appetite for immortality on the one hand. It threatens universal extinction on the other. Technology is lust removed from nature.\u201d DeLillo\u2019s previous novel, 2010\u2019s", ", took its title from the idea of the Omega Point, the French paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s theory about the eventual merger of humanity and technology. For the past two years I\u2019ve been writing a book about the transhumanist movement and related topics. On several occasions during the reporting\u2014not least while touring an actual cryonics facility in Scottsdale, Arizona\u00b1I found myself wondering what Don DeLillo might make of the whole business. It\u2019s rare that a question of this sort receives an answer as direct and literal as", "The Kyrgyzstani compound\u2014located, as the skeptical Jeff puts it, \u201cat the far margins of plausibility\u201d\u2014is the desert outpost of a futurist quasi-cult called the Convergence. For all its sci-fi strangeness, the group reflects the ideas of actual Silicon Valley immortalists like Peter Thiel and Ray Kurzweil,", ": It offers a vision of eternal life to its wealthy benefactors, a chance of outmaneuvering mortality through applied science and applied capitalism. \u201cThe pod would be his final shrine of entitlement,\u201d as Jeff reflects after a bitter argument with Ross. The reason for that bitter argument is this: Ross, unable to face the loss of Artis, has decided to cut to the chase and have himself prematurely suspended\u2014a premium immortality service the Convergence offers its preferred clients. Jeff sees this as the latest in a series of fatherly abdications: Their relationship is overshadowed by Ross\u2019s abandonment, decades previously, of him and his mother.", "If all this makes", "sound like a family melodrama set against the backdrop of a techno-millenarian sect (", "), let me remind you that this is a Don DeLillo novel, and so such hot-blooded novelistic concerns are little more than a backdrop to the backdrop\u2014a means of populating the setting, of animating the theme. DeLillo\u2019s foregrounding of backdrop frequently happens on a fairly literal level: There are several interludes in which Jeff loiters in the hallways of the Kyrgyzstan facility, gazing at a series of huge screens on which stylized silent films of cataclysm are projected: floods, tornados, self-immolating monks, terrorist atrocities. \u201cThey were drenching me in last things,\u201d as Jeff puts it. As ever, DeLillo is clinically interested in the haunting spectacle of catastrophe on film.

His preoccupations with the deceleration of narrative time and the passage of history toward some unnamable apocalyptic event have become more pronounced with every new work. In this sense, the writer he seems more and more to resemble is Samuel Beckett.", "exhibits unmistakable traces of Beckett\u2019s late style\u2014in DeLillo\u2019s increasingly terse humor, in sentences that seem to contain their own negation. See, for instance, Ross\u2019s description of the view of the landscape from the window of his father\u2019s room at the compound: \u201cSky pale and bare, day fading in the west, if it was the west, if it was the sky.\u201d This is the sort of sky, dead or nearly dead, you imagine Clov looking out at in", "and the sort of description of it he\u2019d give.", "In the novel\u2019s short and disorienting middle section, DeLillo delivers the unmediated consciousness of Artis, the telegraphic flickerings of her brain in its purgatorial suspension between life and death.", "You can imagine these words coming out of the disembodied mouth of", ", or spoken by the self-devouring voices of the urned dead in", "DeLillo\u2019s fiction has featured some irreducibly strange and indelible characters.", "But what has tended to be most memorable about them is the language with which DeLillo invests them, the singularity of voice. In", ", as with most of his more recent work, DeLillo\u2019s characters often feel less like fully realized human beings than conduits for the various preoccupations and ideas at work in the narrative. Although it is often off-putting and compromises the sense of immersion in a compellingly ideated fictional world, this sense of incomplete realization seems structural to the book\u2019s aims\u2014to its portrayal of a life of overwhelming technological connectedness, in which people exist at a remove from each other and themselves. \u201cI feel artificially myself,\u201d Artis says on the eve of her cryonic suspension. \u201cI\u2019m someone who\u2019s supposed to be me.\u201d", "The novel is saturated with a sense of lost meaning, an untethering of everything\u2014people, places, objects\u2014from their former significance. It has long been Jeff\u2019s custom, he tells us, to force himself to define certain everyday terms, a gesture of desperate clutching after meaning. There is, for example, this passage near the beginning of the book, which reads like a reduction of Jacques Derrida to deadpan shtick:", "There\u2019s a character who comes out of nowhere near the end of", "and never appears again, a leader of the Convergence who addresses a room of people about to be preserved. She\u2019s barely a character at all, really, so much as a voice, sent to deliver a monologue to the soon-to-be-disembodied acolytes of the Convergence. DeLillo, who turns 80 this year, is extraordinarily penetrating on the ways in which our lives have been permeated and estranged by our pervasive technologies:", "DeLillo\u2019s gaze on contemporary culture retains its unsettling intimacy, even as his writing has become more detached in affect. Reading him, the impression is of viewing the world from a great distance through an extremely powerful lens: Everything is remote but revealed with uncanny clarity.
