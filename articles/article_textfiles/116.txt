In two new second books, Maggie Dietz and Tess Taylor, both white American women, both adept in traditional meters, make poems of the days in such places and the desire to create something while there.", "Dietz, who once served as an assistant poetry editor at", "(she and I have never met, and our tenures here didn\u2019t overlap), opens", "with a poem whose last lines give the book its title. Called \u201c", ",\u201d it begins in the altered, clarified world she saw after getting her first pair of glasses. It ends:", "Dietz often makes the ordinary world interesting by being dissatisfied with it. There\u2019s a restlessness to her attention, as in the phrase \u201c", "kind of happy,\u201d which keeps the pressure of some worthier reality pressed up against this one. The intelligence that looks for connections (\u201cIt was the same / years later\u201d) also keeps pulling in other possibilities, some other kind of happiness more clearly earned and less obviously self-serving, as in the italics of \u201cshining on", "\u201d", "There\u2019s wariness here about invention, the fear of sham happiness, in consort with the sense that some activity, some making, must be offered up in order for happiness to be earned. Those conflicting imperatives frequently register in the intricate energy of Dietz\u2019s descriptions, which are often sonically dense, carefully lineated, grammatically complex, and observed with imaginative precision. Consider these lines earlier in \u201cZoloft\u201d: \u201cWhen the wind lifted the leaves the trees went pale, / then dark again, in waves.\u201d Dietz is able to sustain the sparking charge of such observation over a long run of sentences and lines, as she does throughout the sharp and bruised tetrameter of \u201c", ",\u201d which echoes early Robert Lowell in lines like \u201cFingers of smoke sift and thicken. / Ashen figures swarm the smitten / Grave.\u201d In \u201cNovember,\u201d she turns to impatient blank verse:", "This is description as its own justification, lit by worries that the life in which such observation happens isn\u2019t worthy of attention. But like many poets who excel at description, Dietz sometimes has a hard time ending poems without too successfully pinning things down. \u201cNovember\u201d closes:", "Dietz omits a final conjunction in the final lines, adding an overwhelmingly conclusive note, the concluding metaphor so easily translated that the lights seem not so much out as unreal. She also shows a pronounced taste (as does Taylor) for the appositive verb, in which a compound verb has no conjunction: Think a phrase like \u201che runs, walks.\u201d This omission of conjunctions has become familiar enough to sound like a signal that we are reading", "now, especially when there might be anxiety over whether the materials matter enough for something so grand:", "\u201c", "\u201d ends in another hard stop on listed images, but it matters less there in part because those final images are so beautifully rendered. The title, with its echo of childishness, once again invokes the desire for the right experience, this time under the shadow of death: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t how / I wanted us to end.\u201d The poem opens in a long, jittery, unpredicated setting of the mobile scene:", "Those repetitions\u2014\u201cdeer\u201d popping up three times, in three different forms; the two \u201cstreetlights\u201d rhyming awkwardly in the second stanza; the almost random division of \u201cfields\u201d from \u201cfields\u201d\u2014collude with the persistent verging on a complete sentence, the frequent shifts in tone, syntax, and significance just after a break. The first real verb doesn\u2019t come until the ninth line, when the narrative is interrupted by a different subject (her grandfather\u2019s death) and a different voice (presumably his). The deer come back, \u201cspirits drifting, foraging, so many / souls of the damned,\u201d a peril to the couple driving late at night on underlit roads.\u00a0 Notably, and characteristically, those same animals also introduce beauty into the too-predictable order of the characters\u2019 lives.", "Dietz seems drawn to violence, particularly natural violence that unburies the darkness underneath suburban life. She devotes one poem to inviting \u201cwrathful rain\u201d to fall and \u201coutwit the drains\u201d:", "Another poem revels in smashing words and consonants together to find language for the delight of a demolition derby, its four-beat lines breaking forcefully against the syntax of its odic lists:", "Dietz closes the book with \u201cAnywhere Elsewhere,\u201d an extraordinary poem about the appetite for an elsewhere it can\u2019t conjure or dismiss. It\u2019s a poem of unusual violence and extremity.\u00a0 An intricate and almost-willfully destructive sense of dislocation draws her into the details of a particular place:", "Tess Taylor\u2019s", ", on the other hand, is set almost entirely in an elsewhere in which she tries, for the better part of a year, to put down figurative and literal roots. According to", ", where Taylor reviews poetry for", ", the book was \u201cinspired by her year spent working on a farm in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts. She was there living alone in a cabin as part of a writer\u2019s residency, finishing her first book of verse, and \u2018had nothing to do but write.\u2019 \u201d", "Though Taylor\u2019s biography makes sure to note that she, as the NPR piece explains, \u201chad long volunteered at community gardens,\u201d she comes to the farm as an outsider, and her poems engage the work and land in very different terms than, for example, a poet like", ", who has lived for years on a working farm.", "more often treats the land as a kind of ancient text, one evoked in its title, with its echo of Hesiod, and often explicitly tied to her attempts to create both poems and life. She frequently does her best work in broad terms, drawing a restrained beauty from the provisional bounty of the seasons. The book opens at the end of winter, with a poem of just four lines:", "Taylor writes of herself at a distance, typically as \u201cyou,\u201d sometimes part of a \u201cwe,\u201d but very rarely standing alone inside herself as an \u201cI.\u201d In one poem, she moves from the crowded largeness of the world into something plainer and vaster:", "Taylor\u2019s awareness that neither the small organic farm nor her writer\u2019s cabin represents the world at large intrudes frequently, as with the oil-tankers, meth, terrorists and disease above. But those intrusions rarely seem as credible as the spacious \u201cnot always\u201d she lifts off into there at the end, after the first \u201cThis is.\u201d The initial \u201cthis\u201d", "take as its antecedent all that has preceded it in the poem, but it seems more likely that it looks ahead to the thinking that follows. The second \u201cthis\u201d feels larger. It seems to mean oil rigs and injustice only incidentally; the real focus is on the majesty of one life in which those things can seem, however briefly, beside the point. It\u2019s a risky turn, and you can hear Taylor\u2019s awareness of the risk in that hedge\u2014", ". Such a shifting in scales can be a too-easy source of absolution for the destruction our lives entail and overlook. But just as we wound, we are wounded, too, and the awestruck ability to stand inside the vastness of a history in which even all of human achievement is small is part of what allows us to heal.", "Among the wounds Taylor is looking to assuage in the earth is a miscarriage, one she describes, in \u201cSoil Black,\u201d in unusually dense language:", "I admire everything about this, including the \u201c& yes, I know,\u201d which in its reluctance to deal with the world beyond her immediate experience feels like a truer acknowledgement of that world. It\u2019s a reminder that our smallness is sometimes petty, the unwelcome gravity of others\u2019 suffering distending her grief. Yet her declaration that \u201cI bow into absence\u201d feels like a genuine flowering in the midst of all this, as does the terrible richness with which she describes absence in the lines that come before.", "Late in the book and late in the year, as Taylor, soon to be pregnant again, prepares to head home, she records the new life, the latest harvest, and the old desires, endlessly renewed, at a fair where \u201cIn line for the bathroom, farm people check iPhones\u201d:", "It\u2019s wonderfully carnal, that savoring that carries all the way into darkness. And it is, in some ways, a return to the small poem she opened with: \u201cyour life is short. / To miss even this springtime / would be an error.\u201d The opposite of error, here, is not correctness\u2014it\u2019s life, and the hunger for life, for the vegetables that turn dark soil and the day\u2019s light into sweetness and the animals that turn sweetness into their own sacrificial selves, and for our own conversions, too, the slow, brief blooming of the ordinary in the always arriving, more-than-earthly light, as we encounter it on Earth.", "---", "by Maggie Dietz.
