The editorially mandated addition of Robin the Boy Wonder\u2014the first kid sidekick in comics\u2014occurred less than one year after Batman\u2019s debut, and it accomplished several things at once.

It also gave Batman\u2014who was and remains, beneath all that bat-themed fetishist folderol, a detective in the Sherlock Holmes mode\u2014a loyal Watson to whom he could explain his leaps of deductive reasoning. In giving Batman someone to care about, it raised the stakes. Most importantly, perhaps, it doubled the comic\u2019s sales.", "But gay subtext managed to insinuate itself into the Dynamic Duo\u2019s dyad from the very start.

One person, in particular: Dr. Fredric Wertham, a psychiatrist convinced that comic books were directly responsible for the scourge of juvenile delinquency, led a nationwide anti-comics crusade that proved hugely effective.

(About which: Dude had a point.) He did call Superman out as a fascist, and he noted that Wonder Woman\u2019s whole shtick seemed unapologetically Sapphic. When it came to the Dynamic Duo, he seemed to relish drawing the reader\u2019s attention to Wayne Manor\u2019s \u201cbeautiful flowers in large vases\u201d and the fact that Bruce was given to swanning about the estate in a dressing gown.", "\u201cIt is like a wish-dream,\u201d he famously wrote, \u201cof two homosexuals living together.\u201d", "Fred Wertham, people.

And when queer audiences don\u2019t see ourselves in a given work, we look deeper, parsing every exchange for the faintest hint of something we recognize. This is why, as a visual medium filled with silent cues like body language and background detail, superhero comics have proven a particularly fertile vector for gay readings over the years. Images can assert layers of unspoken meanings that mere words can never conjure. That panel of a be-toweled Bruce and Dick lounging together in their solarium, for example, would not carry the potent homoerotic charge it does, were the same scene simply described in boring ol\u2019 prose.", "Wertham\u2019s crusade rallied church groups, schools and local legislatures against comics.

They shuffled Dick Grayson off to college in 1970, effectively ending the Bruce\u2013Dick partnership that had grown so weighted with gay meta-meanings over the decades. \u00a0Which, really, was all it took for heteronormativity to reassert itself, because while separately Batman and Robin came hardwired with vague gay associations (the fear of one\u2019s secret identity being exposed, for example), it was only ever their status as a bonded male\u2013male pair that had truly raised eyebrows.", "Once out of Bruce\u2019s shadow, Dick dutifully dated women and started his own superteam.

In recent decades, it certainly seems as if his writers have grown more self-aware about unintended gay readings and hence more circumspect. Batman has self-policed himself, and his optics, much more thoroughly since Dick left; it\u2019s quite rare to see any subtextual gay elements bubbling up to the surface.", "But when they do, those bubbles geyser up at a furious froth with enough pounds per square inch to blow the Dynamic Duo\u2019s closet door off its hinges.
