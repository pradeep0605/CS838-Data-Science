Normally that is something that I like to avoid, but I think it works in this case because of how surreal the writing is.", "Another direction that I pursued was this idea of a humanlike vase that I thought could represent the protagonist and her transformation throughout the book. This second option was presented as more of a sketch and it was never fully realized because everyone was leaning toward the red design that ended up being the final cover. The author also liked it, and this was a rare occasion where the design from the first round made it through the approval process without any changes.", "This book is an investigation of the female trainwreck: how she came to be, how she evolved, and what she means in today\u2019s climate of tabloids and social media. One of the first steps in my design process is to identify the tone of the book: dry or humorous, bold or delicate, conceptual or literal, or various combinations of the above. At some point I realized that I couldn\u2019t get too clever or too pretty with this cover. The book\u2019s subject matter and writing style are very bold and to the point; there was no room for humorous interpretations, which had been my initial approach.", "One thing I decided on right away was typography: to apply a typeface widely used in tabloid print. This led to the look and placement of boxes and frames throughout, as well as the color scheme. Then I played with the idea of using an image of a broken doll, but discovered that the doll took away from the book\u2019s serious subject of a woman being scrutinized by the public for being too bold, too sexy, too unapologetic, too much the opposite of what\u2019s considered \u201cgood girl\u201d behavior.

The main difference was that the text was not yet finished when we started. We had some clues from Margaret Atwood: It\u2019s set in prison; there\u2019s been a storm and the lights have gone off; some of the main themes deal with magic, illusion, and theater. Since the novel was a contemporary interpretation of a classic Shakespearean play, the cover also had to combine the past with the present.", "Based on those clues, I produced about six completely different drafts\u2014some were focused on the main character and some on the setting and overall feel. For one cover in the second round of drafts, I zoomed in on the eye of", "and that became our solution: It introduced some of the main themes of the book\u2014solitude, fear, and threat\u2014without being too literal and giving too much away.", "Maria Semple\u2019s sense of humor about her protagonist made me think immediately of", "\u2019s work, of which I\u2019m a huge fan\u2014it\u2019s smart, funny, and intriguing all at the same time. The main character of the book uses \u201cToday Will Be Different\u201d as a sort of mantra\u2014willing it to happen\u2014so repeating the title in text made sense to me. I also did a version where the whole mantra was written out diary-style, and at first, there was some hesitation about the gray background, so I was asked to mock up some other versions of the girl. None of them were nearly as compelling as Geoff\u2019s original painting, however.", "There were a few other designs in the running, some playing into the sense of the character throwing up her hands and crying uncle, others showing her crazy path through the city. Luckily, in the end, everyone came back around to Geoff\u2019s painting. And Semple wrote the repeating title out in her own handwriting for the final jacket as the finishing touch!", "I\u2019ve been fortunate to design the covers for most of Jonathan\u2019s books. This was by far the hardest. In fact, it\u2019s probably one of the hardest jobs I have ever worked on. It took more than 80 visuals to get to this final cover. We tried a lot of different ideas, none of which quite clicked. At one point I was taken off the job, and I resigned myself to the fact that perhaps, after 15 years, it was time for a change and a fresh pair of eyes, and that our working relationship was sadly over. Then to my huge relief, Jonathan and his U.K. editor Simon came back to me with a brainwave, and we started work on the text-based cover.", "The artwork itself ended up being 6 feet long and 3 feet high, with more than 1,000 painted words. I had to paint it again from scratch when the final edit came in, and then correct it when it had been copy edited. I went through an awful lot of paint, board, and wrist pain.", "I think it fits the book pretty well. The detail and meaning of the words merge, and you are left with a colorful, textural wall. The novel refers a lot to division and separation, to boundaries and to walls. It looks deceptively simple and straightforward for something that took more than a year, but it has a personality and weight of its own, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve always tried for with Jonathan\u2019s covers. I think we got there in the end.", "In", ", Nadja Spiegelman delves into the complex relationships she has with the women in her family. Through this memoir, they all confront their past, and it is beautifully painful, vulnerable, and profound. I wanted the cover to feel personal yet relatable.", "Initially, the cover only had a cigarette. We added a hand later in the process, adding a human element. For me, the act of smoking conveys a sense of reflection, as well as rebellion\u2014the internal and outward battles these women fight.", "The idea for this cover was to create sort of a visually onomatopoeic type of alteration: The title", "would feel as though it gets more \u201cshrill\u201d toward the end\u2014as is often the conversational tendency with shrillness. It was a lucky moment with the shapes of the letters, in the word easily lending itself to what I thought of as \u201cshrill-ification\u201d\u2014a simple height alteration, to create a typographic image that alludes to increasing volume or pitch.", "My initial sketches for the cover were, stylistically, more retro and minimalist, but it went through several rounds of marketing dissection and any variety of other mysterious things that go on behind the scenes after a design gets pitched. In the end it\u2019s a different cover\u2014and, in my opinion, not as elegantly handled. But I\u2019m probably the only one who thinks so, being so close to it and having personal feelings about how I\u2019d have liked it to look. The initial impact of the idea survived in the final design.", "by Nicole Dennis-Benn is a visually and emotionally lush novel that takes place in Jamaica, and follows the lives of two sisters (one adult, one still in school) and their mother. In it, we get a sense of classism and racism as well as a societal pressure to fit into a fairly rigid and small community.", "I began researching Jamaican dancehall posters for color, composition, and typography. I was also looking at a lot of Kara Walker\u2019s antebellum artwork and then doing research based on the description of the houses, beach coves, characters, and so forth. The art director and I had settled into the Kara Walker approach for some time before we swung back to the dancehall-style typography, and a more editorial illustration. While I was rooting for", ", I understood that this needed a more commercial package. This direction also made sense conceptually, as the youngest daughter was struggling to become a painter, so approaching it more figuratively, in the end, felt appropriate.", "With obvious reason, everyone in-house was unable to contain their excitement for this book. I will say that it is rare to get to work on the art for a contemporary novel that is so clearly marked as a masterpiece.", "The final version of the jacket was put together after several missteps. I\u2019d originally planned to make the cover a bit more unconventional, but my attempts failed to depict a gravitas commensurate with the text (admittedly an impossible task). What we settled on was a design that wouldn\u2019t alienate readers with any of the designer\u2019s pretensions, one that spoke more to the dignity of the book. Simply reifying the railroad\u2014the fulcrum of the novel itself\u2014was enough to hint at the book\u2019s wonderful strangeness, without revealing too much. The subterranean tracks and the implied digging work on multiple levels as the text does, and this proved an ideal entry point into the alternate world that Colson so exceptionally brings to life.", "This drawing was done in August 2008 while I was working as an architectural intern, living in New York City for the first time.

Even after the dot-com bust and Sept. 11, it seemed that at least since the Second World War, America was moving inexorably toward greater prosperity, healing its racial wounds, and exporting its brand of democracy all across the globe. Many assumed the nation\u2019s upward trajectory would continue unabated. But that story has been much harder to justify since the Great Recession, the debacle of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the renewed attention given to our racial disparities. Fifteen years into this new century, the narrative of progress seems much more difficult to sustain.", "Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore and Thomas J. Sugrue, prominent historians at Yale and NYU respectively, don\u2019t even try. In their timely, remarkable new survey of America since 1890,", "they argue that in many ways we are back to where we started. They begin in the 1890s, when Gilded Age tycoons like Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller controlled much of the nation\u2019s wealth and an enfeebled federal government seemed incapable if not unwilling to stop them. And despite the tremendous strides made during the New Deal and Great Society era, in many ways we find the U.S. facing those exact same problems. Provocatively, Gilmore and Sugrue ask whether the greater equalities of the immediate postwar years, when seen in light of the \u201clong\u201d 20", "century, seems less like an inevitability and more like an \u201chistorical accident.\u201d That they make a compelling case that they do makes this book required reading.", "The curtain opens on the Chicago\u2019s World\u2019s Fair in 1893. The city\u2019s wealthy elite paid for an extravagant complex complete with enormous neoclassical columns, the world\u2019s first Ferris wheel, and a giant statue of Christopher Columbus riding, oddly, a Roman chariot. All this masked the nation\u2019s jarring inequalities: Jim Crow laws were spreading throughout the South; women had not yet received the right to vote; and millions of new immigrants were living in urban slums. Indeed, economic inequality had become the nation\u2019s defining feature at the turn of the century. In 1900, the wealthiest 10 percent pocketed 41 percent of the nation\u2019s income\u2014a number that would only be surpassed in 2010, when the top 10 percent took home 48 percent of the national income. That number only fell between 1950 and 1970, to 33 percent. Even more shocking was the wealthiest 1 percent, who by 1910 had controlled 18 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth, but 8 percent in 1970. Only in 2010 did the top 1 percent again control 18 percent.", "None of this prevented Chicago\u2019s elite from presenting their nation as both the inheritor of Western civilization\u2019s great past (cue the columns and Columbus) and the only hope for its future. Nor was it with any irony that they dubbed the main exposition space the \u201cWhite City.\u201d Yet just outside the main halls, a young black woman named Ida B. Wells worked to expose the city\u2019s myths. Wells distributed pamphlets protesting the fact that blacks were given only the most menial jobs. A 75-year-old Frederick Douglass joined her, delivering a stinging speech that challenged anyone who dared to blame blacks for their inability to achieve parity with whites. \u201cThere is no Negro problem,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cThe problem is whether the American people have loyalty enough, honor enough, patriotism enough, to live up to their own Constitution.\u201d", "But it would take more than any individual, however determined, to overturn segregation. By the 1910s, the progressives emerged as the most likely saviors. To be sure, progressives were not an organized group so much as an informal set of mostly educated men and women who shared a common outlook: that the only way to alleviate poverty, corporate corruption, and end racial and gender discrimination was to expose these problems through rigorous research and translate that data into public policy. In essence, they were technocrats who believed only the government had the power to affect meaningful change.", "Photo by Harold Shapiro", "They succeeded in empowering the government, but only to a point. Sugrue and Gilmore suggest that one of their great failures was in foreign policy. Setting a pattern that would repeat itself throughout the century, many progressives naively believed that the United States could bring democracy to the undeveloped world. Between 1898 and 1912, the United States established a small empire throughout the Western hemisphere, taking control of Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, among others. Gilmore and Sugrue dismiss historians who have overemphasized the role of business elites in backing these imperialist ventures and instead underscore that many liberal-minded progressives supported these wars, too. Take the U.S. invasion of Cuba in 1898: \u201cTo attribute the motivation for intervening in Cuba simply to commerce and markets overlooks the more altruistic thinking of vast swaths of the American public.\u201d The Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union believed that education and democracy would elevate the uncivilized while \u201csome African Americans had originally supported the war because of the terrible things that Butcher Weyler\u201d\u2014the Cuban dictator\u2014\u201chad done to Cubans, many of whom were people of color.\u201d Perhaps more importantly, many blacks believed that a democracy established in a nonwhite nation would become a model for what America might yet become: a postracial democracy.", "Here as elsewhere, Gilmore and Sugrue brook no liberal pieties. To their great credit, they lay bare the many ways that campaigns we tend to see as either entirely just or immoral were far more complex. The women\u2019s suffrage campaign provides an excellent example. In the early 1900s, feminists divided over what they should prioritize. The most radical believed that women not only needed the right to vote, but laws that protected women in the workplace and paid them an equal wage. But mainstream feminists believed they should focus on accessing the ballot first. The differences were not only tactical; they revealed a deeper intellectual divide that resonates to this day. Radicals believed no fundamental difference separated men and women, and women should be treated equally in all aspects of society because of it. Mainstream feminists prioritized getting the right to vote in part because they accepted women\u2019s separate, matronly role. Indeed, highlighting women\u2019s matronly role was critical to their argument: As nurturing mothers and wives, they were imbued with a moral authority that would translate into responsible political citizenship. To accept the radicals\u2019 premise would undercut the basis of their whole argument. With the ratification of the 19", "Amendment in 1920, mainstream feminists won the debate\u2014but not without leaving unresolved women\u2019s inequality in the workplace.", "What began to redress that problem was not a concerted progressive effort but the urgency of war. During World War II, millions of jobs opened for women as men left to fight overseas. In fact, the importance the authors give to war in redressing so many of America\u2019s inequalities points to one of the book\u2019s more problematic aspects. Gilmore and Sugrue celebrate the moments when inequality lessened, yet recoil at one of the key ways by which it was achieved: through war. One could argue\u2014and not with pride, but deep unease\u2014that global dominance was, if not the only, then an essential ingredient to reducing domestic inequality.", "After all, as Gilmore and Sugrue note, entry into the Second World War did more to end the Great Depression and redress racial inequality than any of the New Deal reforms adopted prior to it. It was during the war and its aftermath that the United States emerged as the world\u2019s global power and simultaneously experienced the greatest racial and economic advancements it had ever known. As the authors point out, the first two decades of the Cold War not only created millions of jobs through the growth of a massive military-industrial complex; they gave civil rights activists one of their most powerful arguments. Immediately after the Second World War, black activists successfully began \u201crecasting racial tolerance as a democratic imperative.\u201d It would be an embarrassment for the United States to defend democracy abroad while curtailing it domestically. And Congress listened. It was no coincidence that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed just as the United States ramped up the war in Vietnam.", "Photo by Laurie Beck Peterson", "The authors are at their best when they tease out these unexpected connections. If Vietnam\u2019s role in advancing civil rights provides one example, the way Vietnam simultaneously created new means of police brutality provides another. In the wake of the Watts riots of 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson funneled millions of dollars to local police departments, training police in military techniques developed in Southeast Asia. And as the authors make clear, many of the policies we associate with modern conservatism, from \u201claw and order\u201d policies to deregulation, found key liberal sympathizers. The crackdown on urban black citizens began under Johnson while deregulation found a hero in Jimmy Carter.", "Of course, Gilmore and Sugrue make clear that Reagan, above all, enshrined the idea of trickle-down economics and market-based solutions. But they are at pains to show how much Clinton and Obama shifted the Democratic Party rightward. Indeed,", "becomes most riveting, and will likely arouse most debate, over its judgment of Democrats in the Age of Reagan, which many historians contend is the era we still live in. For all Clinton\u2019s professed empathy for the black community, the authors highlight how his gutting of welfare played to the public\u2019s false, racist image of lazy black \u201c", ".\u201d Clinton gets plenty of blame for abetting the Great Recession too. The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act\u2014a critical piece of New Deal legislation that prevented banks from making risky investments with depositors\u2019 money\u2014unleashed a speculative torrent.", "The authors are only the slightest bit sympathetic to Obama. They concede that he operated under conditions not of his own making. But he \u201cwas not a transformational president.\u201d He caved to Wall Street in bailing out the banks without demanding any meaningful reform; the Affordable Care Act may have insured millions, but countless others have been forced to pay more because its biggest beneficiaries were insurance and drug companies. And his foreign policy effectively continued to do by stealth what George W. Bush barely kept secret at all: drone strikes, secret wiretaps. Other fundamental problems that began at the start of the 20", "century have re-emerged under Obama: racial segregation abetted by a criminal justice system that is the New Jim Crow; anti-immigration nativism, which has hardly been helped by an immigration policy whose only achievement is a record number of deportations. Meanwhile, as of 2012, a woman still made 81 cents for every dollar a man earned.", "cannot cover everything. In a history that underscores persistent racial inequality, some mention in the sections on the 1990s of the beating of Rodney King and the O.J. trials, and less focus on Monica Lewinsky, would have been welcome. In a book devoted to economic inequality, more on the rise of today\u2019s most powerful corporations, Apple and Google, might have been justified. But every comprehensive survey must make sacrifices, and even at more than 700 pages you\u2019ll still be impressed with how much they cover.", "I think that the fundamental problem is that technology has created a winner take all economy where larger benefits accrue to fewer and fewer winners while globalization has reduced the value of skilled and unskilled labor here (while greatly increasing...", "", "", "", "", "More importantly, Gilmore and Sugrue never succumb to defeatism. They highlight the many profound changes over the past century, from women winning the right to vote to the election of a black president. In doing so, they forcefully resist the notion that a narrative centered on the idea that we\u2019ve returned to where we started means that we have achieved nothing in between. The book\u2019s fundamental premise is that America\u2019s history isn\u2019t the product of uncontrollable forces or even a handful of powerful elites. It\u2019s shaped by the \u201cconnections between grassroots actions and elite power,\u201d by \u201cindividual lives, well known and unknown, who join together to make history.\u201d In short, we\u2019ve arrived at our present moment because people, conservatives as much as liberals, have organized, protested, and engaged in politics in order to make the country what they felt it ought to be.

While by the end Schiff\u2019s book pulls itself into a reasonably cohesive shape, offering some credible (if not wholly original) interpretations of the madness that gripped Essex County between February and October of that year, it begins\u2014like most Salem histories\u2014in a bewildering tangle.

Teenagers in particular seem drawn to the subject; not only are they often intrigued by the occult and subject to persecution complexes themselves, but children and adolescents stood at the center of the drama in Salem.

By the end of the craze, as many as 185 people had been named as witches or wizards in 25 villages and towns. Some were arrested, released and arrested again. Fifty-five people confessed, spinning demented but repetitive yarns about infernal hoedowns where the devil served up red bread and red wine. Nineteen people were hanged, and one man, a stubborn holdout who refused to register a plea in a hearing he regarded as illegitimate, was pressed to death under a gradually increased weight of stones by authorities trying to force him to comply. At least one accused witch died as the result of being imprisoned, with dozens of others, in a deplorable jail whose conditions caused one observer to liken it to \u201ca suburb of Hell.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to keep all these people straight. Most lived lives of routine Puritan rectitude. Their names are vexingly similar\u2014the record is a wilderness of Anns and Sarahs\u2014and each is situated in a mind-boggling web of interrelationship, connected to all the others by blood, marriage, remarriage, church membership, business ties, property boundaries, trauma in the recent Indian wars, the Puritan custom of sending one\u2019s children to live and work in other families\u2019 households, or, in the case of the officials and ministers, Harvard.", "The vast majority of the colonists caught up in the craze left no record of their thoughts and experiences during the trials, so there\u2019s very little to distinguish them as characters. The court records themselves are spotty and strongly biased against the defendants. Some diaries and letters from the period were destroyed later, when the witch hunt became a source of shame. Furthermore, on the rare occasions when one of the accused\u2019s statements", "taken down, the meaning isn\u2019t always clear. Giles Corey, the man who was eventually pressed to death, was accused by Hawthorne\u2019s great-grandfather of performing sorcery even as he stood before the magistrates. His response\u2014\u201cI am a poor creature, and cannot help it\u201d\u2014seems weirdly out of character with what proved to be his (literally) die-hard defiance. Accounts written after the crisis come from parties who are far from disinterested, particularly big-shot minister Cotton Mather, depicted by Schiff as the consummate ass-coverer. (That said, Mather, who never actually attended the trials, did argue for caution in evaluating the evidence and leniency in sentencing.)", "Perhaps organizing all of this into a unified, lucid narrative that makes sense to a contemporary audience is impossible, but step one might be to adopt a straightforward, meticulous style designed to help the reader stay oriented. That\u2019s not Schiff\u2019s game. She owes her success in part to her highly colored, dramatic, often elliptical style. \u201cThe sky over New England was crow black, pitch-black, Bible black,\u201d she rhapsodizes at one point, and while I recently spotted a bunch of academic historians ridiculing this bit of poesy on Facebook, I rather liked it myself. Schiff wants to help her reader understand how her subjects felt hemmed in by their vast, dark, unknowable new world. But given that they didn\u2019t understand what was going on, immersing us in their mindset isn\u2019t going to help us understand it either. Schiff also has a habit of putting information in the opposite order in which you want it, presumably to drum up a bit of suspense. For example, she\u2019ll introduce a new character with several sentences of description and only later reveal the person\u2019s name, like a waiter whipping the lid off a platter. This technique works well enough when the character is, say, Julius Caesar, but when she\u2019s just another Martha or Abigail amid a metastasizing list of Puritans, such flourishes only compound the muddle.", "Photo by Elena Siebert", "does redeem itself toward the end, with Schiff\u2019s handling of what few seem to realize was the most remarkable aspect of the Salem witch trials: not how the crisis started but how it ended, and how quickly. Since the 1970s, an explosion in primary-source research into local archives has overturned historians\u2019 understanding of European witch hunts. In that context, Salem\u2019s trials were far from extraordinary; in fact, they were a rather typical case. Most witch hunts, and certainly the bloodiest ones, occurred not in the Middle Ages but in the early modern period, when traditional ways of life felt the encroachment of social change. Most were conducted by civil rather than religious authorities; church leaders (Protestant and Catholic) often tried in vain to moderate the carnage. The preferred targets were older women\u2014not healers and midwives, as some wishful feminist historians would have it, but quarrelsome, disagreeable neighbors whom nobody liked and who served as convenient scapegoats when a baby sickened or a hog died. (Still, a good 20 percent of those executed were men.) Once kindled, a classic witch hunt fed on the tinder of grudges and feuds, the long-harbored animosity of people who lived in close quarters with little to spare.", "Salem\u2019s witch panic followed most of these patterns. It took place against a backdrop of political instability and uncertainty in a colony whose borders were harried by terrifying clashes with Native Americans. Like a notorious 1675 Swedish witch hunt (much referred to by Mather), it began with fabricating and possibly hysterical children: the 9-year-old daughter and 11-year-old niece of the parson of a village on the outskirts of Salem. By the time the crisis reached its greatest frenzy, the most prolific accusers were teenage maids, some of them clearly being fed names of the enemies of their vindictive employers. The Puritans of Salem were extraordinarily fractious even by the usual small-town standards. None of this, however, would have led to such a high body count if it weren\u2019t for William Stoughton, chief magistrate of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, a hanging judge if there ever was one. Stoughton never repented his brutal role in the witch trials. (One judge, Samuel Sewall, would issue a public apology five years later.) The first of the hangings took place in June 1692 and the last in September.", "By October, the tide had turned. Critics became more vocal, a courageous act because anyone who objected to the witch hunt was liable to end up accused and imprisoned. Increase Mather, Cotton\u2019s father, published a treatise that tactfully undermined the legitimacy of \u201cspectral evidence\u201d based on apparitions that were only visible to the accusers. The citizenry grew troubled and doubtful when some of the executed victims pled their cases and behaved in ways that seemed incompatible with having sold their souls to the devil. Someone accused the governor\u2019s wife. A privately circulated letter by an Enlightenment-minded Boston merchant, Thomas Brattle, described by Schiff at length, demolished the cases assembled against the accused. \u201cIn many ways,\u201d Schiff writes of Brattle, \u201che seemed to have parachuted into 1692 from another century altogether.\u201d", "He did seem so, but the sorry truth is that witch hunts in one form or another can happen in any century. Schiff makes a passing reference to the ritual satanic abuse panic of the 1980s. Several adults, many of them daycare and preschool workers, were convicted of horrific crimes solely on the basis of fantastical testimony coaxed out of small children by therapists and other officials using leading questions. No other evidence supported claims that a vast secret network of devil worshippers lay behind these alleged crimes and perpetrated similar atrocities nationwide. It all sounded very much like the conspiracy to overthrow the Massachusetts Bay Colony and claim America for the Prince of Darkness said to be behind the infestation of witches in Essex County in 1692. The inclination to turn against and purge our neighbors seems to be ever-present in human nature, a devil worth learning to recognize and battle the next time he raises his head.", "---", "by Stacy Schiff.

In other words, we\u2019re infatuated with beauty because the universe was created to be beautiful. Wilczek\u2019s aim is grand, perhaps daringly so: He argues that beauty is the core organizational principle of every speck in the universe. The \u201cbeautiful question\u201d of the book is a simple one: \u201cIs the world a work of art?\u201d", "History books reveal that humans have always built their civilizations around two things: an obsessive desire for beauty and an analytical quest for truth.

It\u2019s this symmetry that calls to us. When we declare a certain color combination aesthetically pleasing, what we\u2019re really admiring is its perfect order.

At every turn, Wilczek cleverly reels the science of beauty back to basic organizational principles, whether visual or abstract. Astronomy is shown to operate within simple rules of geometry. Music is deconstructed into its primary form, auditory harmony. The same principles of symmetry and economy, which Wilczek calls the \u201challmarks of nature\u2019s artistic style,\u201d make their way into Newton\u2019s method of reductionism and James Clerk Maxwell\u2019s theory of electrodynamics. Even if we can\u2019t fully understand the laws of nature themselves, Wilczek lets us appreciate how they are mirrored and embedded within one another, catering once again to our deep, universally programmed need for organization.", "Of course, the subject that Wilczek explores is by no means a new one. Phi, the golden ratio that seems to govern the proportions of everything from seashell spirals to man-made financial markets, has captivated mathematicians for more than 2,000 years, as just one of the many puzzlingly organized aspects of the natural world that scholars have explored.

Coates has written a book about immense and ongoing failures of humanity that is a triumph of humanism in itself, a book that renders the injuries of racism brutally near and real.", "Photo by Nina Subin", "The \u201copen letter\u201d is the most overused mode of contemporary writing, a one-sided conversation with someone famous in which the performative bypass of audience creates an aloof sort of anti-intimacy.

Throughout the book Coates employs similar concepts so primal as to be indisputable. Among the most powerful of these is the human body, which Coates mentions relentlessly. He invokes the body as the fundamental unit of human existence and also explores the ways that white and nonwhite bodies have functioned in the building of America. This starts with the book\u2019s opening sentence: \u201cLast Sunday the host of a popular news show asked me what it meant to lose my body,\u201d as Coates recalls a TV anchor\u2019s skepticism to his claim that America was \u201cbuilt on looting and violence.\u201d As a descendant of slaves, Coates\u2019 sheer presence on her show would seem to be evidence of this. Recounting his adolescence, Coates describes his awareness that \u201cNot being violent enough could cost me my body. Being too violent could cost me my body.\u201d Still later he writes of our \u201csprawling prison system, which has turned the warehousing of black bodies into a jobs program for Dreamers and lucrative investment for Dreamers.\u201d \u201cBlack life is cheap,\u201d Coates grimly observes, \u201cbut in America black bodies are a natural resource of incomparable value.\u201d Throughout his book Coates writes about the theft of physical bodies, from slavery up through the prison-industrial complex, and of bodily agency itself, the lack of safety perversely wrought by constant surveillance, when those sworn to protect you imagine themselves as protecting other people from you.", "Time functions similarly. At one point, reminiscing on his son\u2019s toddlerhood, Coates ruminates on the longstanding parenting adage that black children must be \u201ctwice as good to get half as much.\u201d \u201cIt seemed to me that our own rules redoubled plunder,\u201d writes Coates.", "This is a beautiful passage whose beauty works in service of its political heft, and vice versa, as images of romance are converted into objects of loss and siege. To be white and live in the Dream is to live in blissful absence of these fears, and yet Coates\u2019 aim isn\u2019t simply to unsettle this absence, but to force his readership into confrontation with presence, with empathy for those whom the Dream denies.", "isn\u2019t a perfect book, and given Coates\u2019 prominence and a general tendency in contemporary culture to take shots at whoever\u2019s reaping acclaim at a given moment, there will surely be critiques, and some will have merit.

From the media, of course\u2014as with the hippie or the goth, the media used several high-profile women to amplify the flapper\u2019s existence and the anxiety that accompanied it.

They hailed from all echelons of the 1920s social sphere. Tamara de Lempicka, who would make her name painting the New Women of Paris in the 1920s, was a Polish-born refugee of the Russian Revolution.

The similarly well-born Nancy Cunard grew up in thrall to her neglectful and manipulative mother; a fiercely intelligent yet emotionally starved girl, Cunard rebelled by flunking out of debutante society, offering herself to soldiers, and marrying and swiftly divorcing a man who\u2019d promised to offer some semblance of stability.", "When someone violates the status quo, we get up in arms, but we also make the scandalous act", ".", "Zelda Fitzgerald is the most recognizable name of the group, but most know her exclusively as the somewhat-crazed wraith from Hemingway\u2019s", ". But before she was a Fitzgerald, she was Zelda Sayre, with a beauty and vivaciousness so powerful that when she showed up at a dance, all the other girls would give up and go home.

Baker would flee that husband and marry another at 15, but the men were just a means to an escape, the stage, and freedom. Baker, however, was no ordinary showgirl: Even when performing the role of a black stereotype, she inflected it with a complexity that made her, in one producer\u2019s words, \u201cstand out like an exclamation point.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until she went to France that Baker truly made her name and experienced what it meant to not only be venerated, but (relatively) free from prejudice based on the color of her skin.", "If these stories sound tantalizing, it\u2019s because each flapper\u2019s early rebellion and rise to prominence reads as swiftly, and juicily, as the best celebrity gossip, punctuated with lusty affairs (with men and women alike), casual drug use, and the jubilant pleasures of youth.

Once these images were formed, they could become paralyzing: Mackrell describes the Fitzgeralds as \u201ccaptive to their own image\u201d of excess, frivolity, and Jazz Age living, leading to perpetual problems with money and, by extension, their relationship and Zelda\u2019s mental health.

Particularly striking is the disgust with which several of the women greeted news of pregnancy\u2014as a threat not only to their bodies, which would no longer fit the svelte, boy-like fashions of the time, but to their social relevance. Sex could be liberating, but it was also destructive: Several women endured painful, dangerous abortions; others suffered from chronic STDs; nearly all tried to negotiate the balance between an \u201copen\u201d mind toward sexual adventure and partners who manipulated and betrayed them.", "These women\u2019s images were rooted in scandal\u2014not for any single action, but for their sustained violation of ideological norms of what a woman should do, how she should act, and what she could dream for herself. Historically, scandal has functioned as a wedge-driver: When someone violates the status quo, we get up in arms, but we also make the scandalous act", ". Yet even as scandal opens the door to eventual change, it always demands immediate redress: someone must be punished, however symbolically. Nancy Cunard may have changed minds when she dated a black jazz musician, but not the ones closest to her; she was effectively banished from her family and high society.", "And as glamorous and fancy-free as these women were at the height of their powers, they were also punished, often hideously so. After a comeback in the \u201950s, Bankhead withered away to nothing, a shell of her formerly vigorous self and resentful of her camp following. Baker, after years of dancing and straightening her hair with noxious chemicals, was nearly bald and forced to bandage her legs tightly to make her way onstage. De Lempicka\u2019s paintings went out of vogue, and she eventually retired to Houston, where she dominated and controlled her family much in the way she had been dominated and controlled herself. Fitzgerald went slowly mad in a North Carolina asylum. Manners fared the best of the six, but only because she gave up her progressive politics to become a relatively sedate housewife and hostess.", "Mackrell works arduously to recuperate the third acts of these women\u2019s lives\u2014\u201ceven the bleak and blighted years of Zelda\u2019s illness,\u201d for example, \u201cwere in some ways more productive than the decade of her jazz age success\u201d (420), and while Cunard\u2019s \u201cmind and body had been battered a point where she was barely recognizable, she had refused to conform to what others wanted for her,\u201d and in this, \u201cthe terms on which she died had somehow remained her own\u201d (418). The book\u2019s selling point, after all, is the vivaciousness of these women\u2014and it would be depressing to outline the ways in which they were ultimately beaten down by the society they had once so fascinated.", "But the culmination of these stories", "depressing, and Mackrell\u2019s tidy codas do these women, and their memories, a disservice. For all of the book\u2019s detailed attempts to contextualize the societal and cultural mores against which these women rebelled, it fails to situate these women\u2019s fates within the Depression-era desire to pinpoint a cause for the market crash and the misery that followed.", "Of course, the Depression was the result of years of poor policy and investment practices, almost all of it on the part of white, wealthy men. Yet when it came to anointing a scapegoat, the highly visible flappers were easy and vulnerable targets. It was never as simple as a prosecution; rather, a turning of the cultural tide, a shift in the societal temperature, made their once celebrated lives into something denigrated and dirty, especially in the United States. Mackrell skates around this point in her explanation of the end of the era, but lacks the clarity and incisiveness that would give the conclusion some feminist teeth.", "For these six beguiling women were indeed part of a dangerous generation, but what\u2019s even more dangerous\u2014and absolutely worthy of sustained, incisive attention\u2014is the way they, and the sexual energy that fueled them, were put in their place, ushering in years of reactionary and regressive sexual politics.

Old-timey parents had to do a lot more work just to provide children with basic staples. Now parents have outsourced all that responsibility to schools, pediatricians, and Target. As a result, the work of the modern parent is less tangible, more metaphysical; modern parents try to set their children on the path toward a happy life.

In the long run, this attitude may or may not serve them well, because they then enter the world with the sense that no power structure is too formidable to defy or outmaneuver.\u201d This may not even serve them well in the short run, since one immediate result of active parental involvement is passivity: \u201cBecause middle-class children today occupy privileged positions within the family, and because their parents have overextended themselves on their behalf, kids sense that they have the power to make their boredom their parents\u2019 responsibility.\u201d", "is the parents\u2019 responsibility.

{"Body": ["Illustration by Gustavo Duarte", "Whenever I read the work of the late German writer W.G. Sebald, I get distracted here and there by a preoccupation with the fact that he worked for most of his life as an academic. Probably this is because I\u2019ve spent many of my years in a similar environment, and I often wonder about the formative pressures this has exerted, over time, on my own writing and thinking. His relationship with the academy was not that of the standard contemporary writer, who is typically housed within the disciplinary annex of \u201ccreative writing\u201d and who does not concern himself with the business of academia per se. Sebald, although he did also teach creative writing, was a full-blown scholar, a company man of long standing who lectured in the department of German literature at the University of East Anglia from 1970 until his death in 2001. In ways that are both subtle and pronounced, this shows through in his writing\u2014in his essays and novels (which he preferred to call his \u201cprose narratives\u201d).", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "Books like", "and", ", for instance, are, in much of their content if not their form, works of deep research. The Sebaldian narrator\u2014let\u2019s just go ahead and call him Sebald\u2014is a meandering presence, of course, picking his way across the secluded routes between landscape and subject; but there is always the sense of him emerging into the world after a long tenure in the artificial light of libraries and lecture halls, breathing the fine dust of scholarship. It\u2019s always tempting to compare Sebald to Borges\u2014among other narrative oddities,", "contains a detailed synopsis of Borges\u2019 \u201cTl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\u201d\u2014but where Borges\u2019 fiction tended to use the apparatus and affectations of scholarship in service of a kind of structural irony, Sebald\u2019s art is scholarly in a much more fundamental way. As Adam Phillips has put it, he was \u201cmore like a new kind of historian than a new kind of novelist.\u201d", "So one of the things that\u2019s always interesting about this writer is how close he seems to come, in his methods, to creating works of scholarship, and how far the books themselves are from the sort of thing typically produced by academics. In Sebald\u2019s essay collection", "originally published in German in 1998 but only now translated into English, there\u2019s a sustained proximity to, and distance from, straight scholarship. Reading it, I kept thinking about how its basic materials might have been incorporated into a more conventional academic text, how its various strands might be tied together into an overall argument about", ", or the themes of place and exile as they are manifested in same. How it might, in other words, present itself as that most humbly learned of cultural products,", "on some topic or other.", "The book is a collection of six critical essays, on five writers and one painter, which coheres into a thematic whole in ways that are often only glancingly apparent. Of the literary figures Sebald writes on here\u2014Johann Peter Hebel, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Eduard M\u00f6rike, Gottfried Keller, and Robert Walser\u2014only Rousseau and Walser are likely to be well-known to Anglophone readers. All are writers for whom Sebald holds a deep and abiding affinity, an \u201cunwavering affection,\u201d as he puts it in his short foreword to the book. That foreword inaugurates proceedings with a familiar Sebaldian note of autobiographical exactitude, a customary laying out of the specifics of place and time. \u201cI can still remember quite clearly how, when I set out from Switzerland for Manchester in the early autumn of 1966,\u201d he writes, \u201cI placed Gottfried Keller\u2019s", "Johann Peter Hebel\u2019s", ", and a disintegrating copy of Robert Walser\u2019s", "in my suitcase.\u201d \u00a0These are writers who have stayed with him, who have over time become part of his intellectual makeup, and he feels that he must \u201cpay my respects to them before, perhaps, it is too late.\u201d", "And this front-and-center placement of the personal is one way in which", "distinguishes itself from more traditionally academic modes of critical writing. It\u2019s tempting, here and there, to read these pieces as oblique works of self-portraiture, on the (probably spurious) principle that any writer writing about another writer is always, to some degree, writing about himself. Certainly, you do feel in these essays the gravitational pull of the historical preoccupations that characterize so much of Sebald\u2019s own creative work. Although the writers discussed are all figures of the 18", ", 19", "and early 20", "centuries, the Second World War is still an unavoidable presence here, like a sinkhole in the landscape of time into which everything on either side is always at risk of falling. (Sebald\u2019s books, with their oneiric logic and frequent invocation of the labyrinthine horrors of Europe\u2019s past, are a constant reaffirmation of Joyce\u2019s idea of history as a nightmare from which there can be no awakening.)", "\u201cThat\u2019s an abyss. Also an abyss. Another abyss. Yes, I\u2019m afraid these are all terrifying abysses.\u201d", "In the first piece, we see Hebel\u2014a popular German almanac author of the early 19", "century, beloved of Benjamin and Kafka\u2014listing figures to enumerate the vast devastation of the Napoleonic Wars. Sebald quotes him at length striking a distinctly proto-Sebaldian tone on the destruction wrought by the French occupation of Moscow: \u201cIf one stood and looked down from a height, as far as the eye could see there was nothing but sky and Moscow. Thereafter, nothing but sky and flames. For hardly had the French occupied the city than the Russians themselves set fire on all sides. A steady wind quickly spread the flames into every quarter of the city. In three days the greater part of the latter was reduced to rubble and ashes, and for anyone passing that way, there was nothing left to see but sky and desolation.\u201d", "European history is not, to Hebel or Sebald, a succession of linked occurrences, but one terrible event that is always happening, always echoing back and forth across time\u2014\u201cour history,\u201d as he puts it in", ", is \u201cbut a long account of calamities.\u201d Sebald suggests the possibility that Hebel may, in this way, have foreseen something of the disasters to come, that he may have \u201calready had a sense, in 1812/13, that the fall of Napoleon and the rise of the German peoples signaled the beginning of a downward path which, once embarked upon, would not be easy to halt, and that history, from that point on, would amount to nothing other than the martyrology of mankind.\u201d", "Photo by Isolde Ohlbaum/Random House", "Sebald has a way of viewing the world whereby seemingly minor misfortunes or cruelties are made to stand for catastrophes too terrible to be directly observed. Even the smallest of sadnesses seem to open onto an abyss. The collection\u2019s beautiful final piece, on the contemporary painter Jan Peter Tripp (with whom he collaborated on the posthumous book", "), contains a haunting evocation of death in the tiny particularity of a dead mouse, depicted in one of Tripp\u2019s eerily ironic still lifes. For Sebald, the dead always have something to tell us, and even this tiny corpse conveys its own \u201csilent message.\u201d\u00a0\u201cNestling in nothingness,\u201d he writes, \u201cwith neither ground nor background, the creature hovers now, its bat ears extended, through thin air. The black patch of fur around its eyes is reminiscent of a mourning band, or an eye mask worn by a sleeping passenger on a summer night\u2019s flight over the North Pole.\u201d The silent message conveyed by the dead mouse, and by the images in Tripp\u2019s work as a whole, is for Sebald a synecdoche for some unspeakable communication:", "This is, of course, a highly idiosyncratic definition of painting\u2014and one that obviously tells us a great deal less about the business of painting than it does about the writer\u2019s desolate view of life, and his sepulchral approach to art. (I have a cartoonish mental image of Sebald being presented with a succession of Rorschach cards by a caricature shrink, and calmly interpreting each blot in exactly the same way: \u201cThat\u2019s an abyss. Also an abyss. Another abyss. Yes, I\u2019m afraid these are all terrifying abysses.\u201d) It\u2019s hard not to read this reflection on the pathological investigations of visual art as mirroring back upon Sebald\u2019s own creative work, which is so alive with symbols of death, and which, in its sly and patient way, continually lays bare the dark inner lining of reality.", "Just as, in sketching the lives of six Swiss and German subjects, the essays travel back and forth over the Alps, the collection is itself marked by strange crossings between past and present, between the lives of the subjects, and between those lives and the author relating them. What draws him back continually to Hebel, he says, is the memory of his own grandfather, whose use of language reminds him of the writer\u2019s, and who used to jot down weather patterns and saint days in Hebel\u2019s almanac. (Photographs of these jottings are included in the text, as though to illustrate the ways in which the details of one\u2019s own past overwrite the image of a text in memory.)", "This grandfather reappears later in the book, in ghostly superimposition over the figure of Robert Walser. The Walser essay contains a clustered sequence of photographs of the writer at various ages\u2014\u201cstations in a life which hint at the silent catastrophe that has taken place between each.\u201d \u00a0Two of these images feature an older Walser holding the hand of a young boy, both of them clutching walking sticks and posing for the camera against a rural backdrop:", "There\u2019s an odd pathos to the interlocking associations of these photographs in Sebald\u2019s memory, and the somber movement of the prose as it gathers together its disparate elements, its transmutations. And of all the images alluded to here, it\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t appear on the page that has the strongest impact: the photograph of Walser\u2019s body in the snow, taken after he dropped dead of a heart attack on his last walk, in a field near the asylum where he spent the last 23 years of his life. That photograph would have made for a jarring insertion here, and perhaps a crass one; its absence is more haunting than its presence would have been. And by some occult means, it seems to reappear in the next essay, in Tripp\u2019s hyperrealistic depiction of the dead mouse, sprawled against the wintry emptiness of a blank background, and backed by the white light of eternity. In Sebald\u2019s writing, everything is connected, everything webbed together by the unseen threads of history, or chance, or fate, or death. The scholarly craft of gathering scattered sources and weaving them into a coherent whole is transformed here into something beautiful and unsettling, elevated into an art of the uncanny\u2014an art that was, in the end, Sebald\u2019s strange and inscrutable gift.", "---", "by W.G.

He defends TV and film composer Henry Mancini from charges of fuddy-duddyness: \u201cThe sides you carved were strictly, like, young.\u201d He gives Ray Charles\u2019 \u201c", "\u201d its due, asserting that the song\u2014\u201csquare-ass backup singers and all\u2014just may have been the most beautiful three minutes and thirty-nine seconds in all of twentieth century music.\u201d", "", "Or take his essay on Connie Boswell, an obscure 1930s singer who fascinates Fagen. Boswell, he writes, exhibits a manner \u201csimultaneously hot and cool: she\u2019s emotionally connected to the lyric and at the same time reveals a self-reflexive, ironic quality that\u2019s astonishing for the era.\u201d As it happens, that description also perfectly captures the delicate hot/cool balance that Fagen himself pulled off in his vocal performances on Steely Dan records. And it\u2019s the kind of top-notch, incisive cultural critique that you ain\u2019t gonna get from the likes of Keith Richards. Just like the lyrics he penned for the Dan, Fagen\u2019s writing here is charged with a zingy, acerbic intelligence. I love his tossed-off insults (\u201ca bit of a moldy fig\u201d) and his quirky interrogative beats (\u201cGot that, chillun\u2019?\u201d). He refers to a songstress \u201ctwitching like a maenad\u201d and recasts Ike Turner as an R&B Faust.", "In one revealing passage, Fagen expresses his fondness for Wes Anderson\u2014another perfectionist who seems to approach his art less as a spontaneous eruption of creativity and more as a precise, controlled process of assemblage. In Steely Dan\u2019s heyday, the \u201cband\u201d was mostly a rotating crew of studio musicians, each carefully chosen to play on specific tracks they were suited to. Fagen and his partner Walter Becker would sift mercilessly through these takes, in some instances recording several different guitarists\u2019 versions of a solo before they\u2019d settle on one with the proper vibe. There is a calculated remove to these songs\u2014an ironic distance\u2014not unlike the feeling you often get watching an Anderson film.", "", "Fagen possesses none of the swagger of the typical rock dude\u2014those ambulatory ids who love to splash around inside the chaos of their own stardom. He\u2019s far too self-conscious for that. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d he confesses in his introduction, \u201cuntil I got out of high school, I was pretty sure I\u2019d end up in journalism or teaching English or working in a bookstore or something along those lines.\u201d He is both blessed and cursed with the observer mentality. An asset when he\u2019s crafting clever, character-driven song narratives; a hurdle when he\u2019s up on stage or dealing with needy fans.", "It also goes a long way toward explaining his appeal to a certain species of shy, cerebral high school kid. The kind of kid who is pretty sure he\u2019ll end up in journalism or something along those lines. Incidentally, as I write this, I notice the Dan is playing at the Beacon.

By extinguishing every coincidence, it turns literature into the same kind of problem as astrology: Do we want structural interpretation to dictate narrative, or is it best when a story\u2019s structure, as one character puts it, \u201calways changes in the telling\u201d?", "One way to read Catton\u2019s novel is as kind of antipodean crossword, in which the clues lead one not to a filling-in of blanks but to the erasure of content\u2014so the solution is little more than the grid into which everything fit. Each of the novel\u2019s 12 sections begins with an astrological chart for the date and location of its setting, which dictates what and how events will unfold. A \u201cCharacter Chart\u201d at the front of the book indicates 12 \u201cstellar\u201d characters, each associated with a sign of the zodiac and a location representing one of the astrological houses. These determine both the character\u2019s destiny and his personal characteristics. Example: One chapter indicates that the constellation Aries\u2014represented here by the Maori hunter Te Rau Tawhare\u2014is in the third house, which in astrology has to do with brotherhood, communication, etc., all of which make sense in the context of the plot. In addition to these zodiac-affiliated characters, there are seven \u201cplanetary\u201d ones that rotate throughout the astrological chart from month to month. One quickly discovers that the chapter titled \u201cVenus in Capricorn\u201d will primarily consist of a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between the characters associated with Venus (the alluring Lydia Wells) and Capricorn (Aubert Gascoigne, a clerk).", "The titular \u201cluminaries\u201d\u2014the astrological designation for sun and moon\u2014are the opium-addicted whore Anna Wetherall and the prospector Emery Staines. In astrology, the sun more or less represents exterior, visible things, and the moon personal, internal ones, ergo so do these two\u2014but they often reflect one another, exchanging qualities. Emery, in what is clearly a lunar phase, describes their relationship as \u201ca connexion, by virtue of which he feels less, rather than more, complete, in the sense that her nature, being both oppositional to and in accord with his own, seems to illumine those internal aspects of his character that his external manner does not or cannot betray, leaving him feeling \u2026 doubled when in her presence, and halved when out of it.\u201d And then there is Crosbie Wells, a drunkard whose murder is the still point around which the whole novel turns: Earth, in other words.", "As if this were not enough, the very length of the novel\u2019s 12 sections has been planned in advance, beginning at 360 pages (not coincidentally, the number of degrees in a circle), and declining progressively until the final part of just three.

Neither are we allowed to fully engage on the level of characters or plot\u2014the astrological contrivance is too shifty for that.

In fact, once the structural conceit becomes apparent, every detail of the novel glows with such intention that it almost blinds you to the pleasures of story.

How and why, when so much care is manifest, do we feel manhandled? Do subjective responses suffer when an author\u2014or the cosmos, in this case\u2014dictates every element of the work to the point that even after 848 pages both character and plot can be drowned out by their own determinant structure?

Faced with promising newcomers to e-commerce spaces that he wanted to add to his empire, Bezos in both cases opened with lowball acquisition offers. When rebuffed, instead of negotiating he launched ferocious price wars, selling shoes and diapers at far below wholesale cost. Once it was clear Bezos would rather lose millions destroying rivals than spend them on higher acquisition prices, both firms were induced to sell and join the Amazon family. And hey, at least those Web startups got buyout offers and ultimately made money from Bezos\u2019 empire-building. Bookstore chains just got stomped on.", "But throughout it all, Amazon stays remarkably true to its core vision of long-term growth via customer satisfaction.

In plain terms, the Beatles sucked when they went to Hamburg for the first time in 1960. They got the gig in the first place only because manager/impresario Allan Williams had no one else to send. But Lewisohn has a knack for underscoring the moment, the precise moment, when things change, and another rung of the ladder is attained.

She was a virtuoso of the literary sit-down, working the form into an occasion for informal self-portrait. There\u2019s no one topic that particularly dominates in this 138-page interview, but there are certain themes and preoccupations that assert themselves throughout: the ideal of personal autonomy, the complexities of love and friendship and sexuality, the historical constitution of ideas and behaviors we tend to think of as natural.

But with Sontag, you suspect that she really", "read everything\u2014and not in the Harold Bloom way, either, where encyclopedic erudition starts to look like a kind of petrification, where the critic manifests himself as the canon made flesh.

I didn\u2019t discover American literature until much later.\u201d What to do with such a claim but both laugh at it and marvel at it? I thought of how my mother likes to remind me of my own alleged precocity by mentioning how she once came across me, age about 5, peering into a Jeffrey Archer blockbuster as though it contained the secret of life. By that age, Sontag would have been rolling up her sleeves and getting into Cervantes.", "But this long and largely genial portrait of the (not always quite so genial) intellectual in middle age also amounts to a strong and deeply personal argument about what it means to be cultured\u2014an argument for why a middle-aged intellectual might be something worth being in the first place. Part of what is so appealing about Sontag\u2019s thinking is the absence of any heavy intellectual machinery being brought to bear on whatever topic she happens to be considering; there is rarely very much in the way of dogma to be contended with.

Rockwell created the imagery of the Boy Scouts\u2014his most lucrative and long-lasting gig was for the annual Boy Scout calendar\u2014but he was himself not particularly outdoorsy, a neat freak who couldn\u2019t bear to get dirty. He created memorable images of piety (", ", 1951), but his clan was uninterested in religion; captured scenes of scampy rebellion (", ", 1954) but was rule-bound and order-obsessed; and, most damningly, painted odes to family togetherness (", ", 1948) but was so affectionless that his own family despaired of ever knowing him. His first bride, Irene O\u2019Connor, divorced him in 1930 on grounds of \u201cmental cruelty;\u201d his second wife, Mary Barstow, was driven to alcoholism and finally the mental hospital by his remove. Only his third wife, Molly Punderson, whom he met when he was 65 and she 64, seems to have been a fit, and they slept in separate beds. \u201cAt last he had found his feminine ideal,\u201d Solomon writes: \u201can elderly schoolteacher who was unlikely to make sexual demands on him.\u201d", "\u2019s most controversial point will likely be Solomon\u2019s conclusion that part of the sexless character of Rockwell\u2019s oeuvre can be traced to his own repression, specifically the fact that he was attracted to men but unable to express it. While living in New Rochelle, Rockwell forged an extremely intimate relationship with the Leyendecker brothers, famous illustrators who created the proto-metrosexual \u201c", ",\u201d and were gay. Seeking therapy in the late \u201950s, Rockwell apparently confessed to having \u201coverly intense relationships\u201d with men, though he was so reserved, even in his private correspondence, that it is hard to know what he meant by this. \u00a0Piecing together the details of a two-week-long long fishing trip he took to Canada in 1934 with his handsome model and studio assistant, Fred Hildebrandt, Solomon comes to a suggestive dead end:", "Whatever the case on this score, Rockwell\u2019s detachment was not confined to his personal affairs. While his public persona was all self-deprecating humor and his illustrations usually had a jokey vibe to them, he could be extraordinarily, robotically cold. In the late \u201930s, he moved to Arlington, whose residents became part of his folksy New England cosmology. Yet when he moved abruptly away more than a decade later, in 1953, to pursue psychotherapy at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, it was as if a switch had been turned off: \u201cIf someone had been a very close friend, when Norman moved \u2026 it was as if they never existed,\u201d an associate remembered. \u201cEveryone complained that he never kept in touch. People said, \u2018We were his best friend, and now we don\u2019t hear from him.\u2019 \u201d", "Perhaps Rockwell\u2019s greatest moment of popular relevance came in the \u201940s, during World War II, when his \u201c", "\u201d became icons of pro-American propaganda, and his Rosie the Riveter suddenly gave his life-long difficulty in representing traditional femininity a national purpose in recruiting women to the war industries. Having already been doing covers for the", "for a quarter century, Rockwell was by then an institution\u2014but he was also becoming an icon of the past. Photojournalism was eroding the basis for magazine illustration as a vital profession, and TV would erode the basis of magazines themselves. Victory in World War II would make the United States a global power, undermining the hold that Rockwell\u2019s whimsical provincialism had on the national imagination,\u00a0though it admittedly had a long afterlife in Eisenhower\u2019s suburban \u201950s.", "Photo courtesy Christian Oth", "only gets truly interesting in its final fourth. Artists often have late-period turnarounds\u2014Titian going quasi-impressionist, Goya lining the walls of his house with nightmare imagery, Matisse breaking free of canvas with his luminous paper cuts.

In its own way, it is as homiletic as his earlier work, but of a different world (partly because, Rockwell remembered, the", "had editorially mandated that African Americans only be shown in service-industry roles); it reflects news from his titanic near-present, not a transmission from a quasi-mythic past.", "Rockwell hardly became a political crusader, but amid the", "of the \u201960s he did at least speak up.

As Vietnam reached the heights of savagery, he repeatedly telegrammed Lyndon Johnson, whose portrait he had once done, pleading with him to end the war. \u201cTimes are changing now, and people are getting angry,\u201d he wrote in 1965. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to get angry too.\u201d No comparably passionate statement appears in the first part of the book, where Rockwell comes across as almost pathologically disengaged. Still,", "doesn\u2019t exactly explain the change, just document it; Rockwell remained an aloof figure, closed into his own quirky world, until the end.", "Why return to Normal Rockwell, now, in 2013? That is a difficult question. Solomon wants to reclaim him as a \u201cpostmodern\u201d artist, but I don\u2019t think that quite flies. We are separated from his imagery of quaint civic rituals, small-town contretemps, and easy patriotic faith by Vietnam and Watergate and Stonewall, by Afghanistan and Lehman Brothers and WikiLeaks. The rage for \u201cAmericana\u201d that Rockwell fed in the \u201920s was, Solomon reminds us, a novel phenomenon of the time, an appetite created by a modernizing America looking for a simple and stable past. Similarly, she says, \u201cRockwellian\u201d as an adjective is an invention of the disillusioned 1970s. In art, we think of this as the period of post-minimalism and performance and the feminist breakthrough. But in politics, Nixon tried to name and speak for a \u201csilent majority\u201d\u2014hostile to the counterculture, pro-business\u2014and the coronation of Rockwell as an unsung American Master was a kind of cultural correlate; his art was populist and unchallenging and, after all, commercial. That touring museum retrospective that the", "article lambasted was, Solomon recounts, the creation of Madison Avenue dealer Bernard Danenberg, who saw a market niche to exploit, and pitched the show to the Brooklyn Museum as a way of attracting large audiences. Rockwell himself declined to show up.", "The right-wing activists who dress in tricorne hats at Tea Party rallies are, perhaps, the contemporary audience for a \u201cRockwellian\u201d myth of America, longing for a homogeneity that never existed. There\u2019s a reason why, when looking to deify Sarah Palin, a conservative fan would", ". Will such an audience want to wade through Solomon\u2019s account of Rockwell\u2019s life in its petty, oddball human actuality?

That makes rest a kind of rebellion. The book begins with reassurance: \u201cIf you\u2019re lying down right now, there\u2019s no need to defend yourself.\u201d After all, life on the X axis is natural, enjoyable, and healthful.

There\u2019s no real sustained argument here, and many chapters sort of drift off at the end. That\u2019s one of this slight book\u2019s charms, and another nice echo of the way the lying-down brain works: Grand emotional or intellectual breakthroughs often arrive on the brink of sleep, but that\u2019s no time to be writing a thesis. Think big thoughts, sure, but do it briefly, hazily. You can do the heavy lifting in the morning.", "Naturally, sleep is one of the book\u2019s major themes.

St\u00f6ckmann promoted his discovery of \u201cthe law of natural time,\u201d which requires going to bed at sunset and rising naturally no later than sunrise. \u201cBy consciously and willingly submitting to the cosmic dictates of the sun\u2019s orbit,\u201d St\u00f6ckmann concluded, \u201cwe must become people of the sun, children of the light.\u201d He wasn\u2019t so far off: Contemporary sleep research indicates that artificial light, particularly the \u201c", "\u201d of iPads and energy-efficient light bulbs, is terrible for sleep.", "For an activity whose very essence is rest, sleep is a persistent cause of human anxiety.

Her drawings have the elegant and open simplicity of woodcuts; there\u2019s an aesthetic of artful childishness and a sort of wry, amiable tension between the old-style fables and origin myths she deals in and the contemporary language she uses. In one Cain and Abel-like story about the murderous origins of the Viking-like Dag and their ancient quarrel with the neighboring Hal, an elder brother refers to a younger as \u201ca wet little fart\u201d and \u201ca pussy.\u201d (If, by the way, you think your 10 year old can deal with this sort of mild saltiness, you could do a lot worse than steering them in the direction of this book.)", "Storytelling is, of course, the work of making beautiful maps of unknown territories.", "Greenberg has a lot of metafictional fun with the theme of storytelling. About halfway through, she introduces a cartographer named Mancini Panini who is famous for his beautiful maps, thought to have been the first to chart Early Earth.

Panini\u2019s methodology turns out to be radically unsound; a severe agoraphobic, he gathers intelligence for his maps by sitting in his tower and peering through his telescope, and then sending out three trained monkeys in pedal boats, armed with paper and pen, to survey the terrain. His map of the world, we are told, is \u201cgenerally agreed by explorers to be completely useless since it is almost entirely wrong on every level,\u201d but he is \u201cpossessed of an excellent imagination and a steady and meticulous drawing hand, and so the maps can be valued as things of beauty.\u201d", "", "Greenberg portrays this scientific failure as integral to a kind of artistic success.

She doesn\u2019t overstrain the metaphor, but our man Panini is elegantly suggestive of storytelling (of art itself, really): the work of making beautiful maps of unknown territories.

As gods, they\u2019re more Hellenic than Abrahamic, which is to say mischievously and playfully human. Birdman emerges, at some unspecified point in Early Earth\u2019s prehistory, from an egg that just appears out of nowhere.

He then lays two eggs of his own, from which emerge the son and daughter who eventually decide, out of cosmic childish boredom, to have a world-making contest. Early Earth turns out to be Kiddo\u2019s creation, a vast, complex world that she carries in her hair; in a fit of jealous petulance at her creative success, her brother cuts off her hair, causing it to tumble into infinity, growing in size and complexity as it falls. With this story, Greenberg is slyly rewriting the rigidly patriarchal source code of the culturally enshrined narratives she\u2019s drawing from.

She is, in this sense, a bit like a cartoon Angela Carter.", "All this stuff might be strenuously whimsical in a work of prose fiction, but the loveliness and composure of Greenberg\u2019s illustration and her playful narrative tone make for an endearing combination\u2014and the whimsy is pretty much inseparable, anyway, from the myth-riffing project as a whole.

But I\u2019m mostly thinking of a congregation of pop-soul records from early in the decade that were, as a rule, grittier and more complex, more grounded in material conditions than was John Lennon\u2019s ode to the positive power of thinking.

These era-defining hit singles declared that we could achieve a new, less imperfect union, and we didn\u2019t have to wait for an afterlife to get there, either. With roots in the African-American church, this worldview has been labeled by critic Craig Werner as the Gospel Impulse: Humans can cross over to the Promised Land, right here and right now, but only if we move beyond an exclusive focus on the saving of individual souls, or on the padding of individual bank accounts, and instead travel as a self-conscious community, roll up our sleeves, and work together. As Werner phrased it in", ", the Gospel Impulse is invested in the idea that \u201cNo one makes it alone. \u2026 [I]f we are going to \u2026 move on up, we\u2019ve got to connect.

Kot\u2019s recounting of the Staples story is momentous and rich, as it should be. I wish there were more of it.", "The basic outlines of the Staples saga are easy enough to find, but Kot traces it well. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Pops Staples toiled in the fields of Dockery Farms in the Mississippi Delta. He learned to play guitar, in part, by watching the performances of Charley Patton and Chester \u201cHowlin\u2019 Wolf\u201d Burnett, known to us as legendary blues players but known to Staples, at the time, as his co-workers. In 1936, Pops\u2014along with wife Oceola, daughter Cleotha, and son Pervis\u2014joined the last century\u2019s Great Migration and relocated to Chicago\u2019s South Side. Two more daughters were soon added to the family, Yvonne in 1937 and Mavis in \u201939, while Pops worked a series of stockyard and factory jobs and sang in a gospel sextet called the Trumpet Jubilees. In 1948, frustrated by his group mates\u2019 lack of commitment, he pulled a $7 pawn-shop guitar from the closet and announced, as Mavis has often recalled over the years, \u201cI\u2019m going to sing with my children.\u201d The first song he taught his kids to harmonize on was \u201cWill the Circle Be Unbroken,\u201d a song most associated, then as now, with another musical clan, the Carter Family. Pops knew it because it was included in many traditional black gospel songbooks. \u201cA better home is waiting,\u201d the song promises. \u201cIn the sky.\u201d", "The rest is gospel and pop history. The Staples established themselves by performing at Chicago\u2019s black churches, then began recording for a series of small independent record labels\u2014in the middle \u201950s, their version of the gospel standard \u201cUncloudy Day\u201d sold, as Pops always put it, \u201clike a rock and roll record\u201d\u2014before moving to Epic Records in 1965 and Stax in 1968. The Staples\u2019 distinctive style was backward glancing and cutting edge at once. On the one hand, it reminded transplanted black listeners of the rural harmonies they\u2019d left behind in the South. On the other, it anticipated the sounds of rock and soul, via Mavis\u2019 spirit-filled lead vocals and Pop\u2019s indelible blues-inflected tremolo guitar.", "They added more driving rhythms and fuller arrangements each step of the way, and they began to push beyond straight gospel material, reaching out to the predominantly white folk-music audience by performing at Carnegie Hall and the Newport Folk Festival and by being early adopters of the Bob Dylan songbook. All of this led to some comparatively lucrative bookings for a black gospel group. But it also linked the Staples to the headlines. Those topical Dylan songs like \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d and \u201cMasters of War,\u201d along with Staples\u2019 recordings of other folk and pop \u201cmessage songs\u201d\u2014not gospel per se but advocating for social progress in ways that were, by Pops\u2019 estimation, consistent with Christian principles\u2014both used and personified the Gospel Impulse, perhaps the era\u2019s key political and artistic tendency. That better home a-waiting didn\u2019t have to be in the sky. It could be on earth, too, where we need it.", "To that end, the group worked often with Martin Luther King Jr. (\u201cIf he can preach it, we can sing it,\u201d Pops said) and at other civil rights happenings. The title of the Staples\u2019 first Stax album pressed home the same point, describing not only the family but a movement:", ".", "Straight ahead were the Staples\u2019 biggest hits: \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There,\u201d of course, but also \u201cIf You\u2019re Ready (Come Go With Me),\u201d \u201cTouch a Hand, Make a Friend,\u201d and more. Each was an exemplar of the Gospel Impulse, not merely a morale-boosting soundtrack for social change but embodiment of the fun and funky world we might create\u2014and a model of how to make it.", "\u201cI know a place, y\u2019all,\u201d Mavis declares on \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There,\u201d her ragged\u2013but right\u2013gospel moan encouraging us to join her in the job of getting there, and its modified reggae soul groove pushing us to dance while we worked because she can\u2019t make it alone. \u201cSomebody help me,\u201d she implores. \u201cSomebody help me now!\u201d", "* * *", "Photo by Bill Hogan. Courtesy of Scribner.", "Gathering together anecdotes by turns harrowing and hilarious, and nearly always inspiring, Kot recounts the arc of the Staples\u2019 career in breezy, page-turning prose, and gives the principals plenty of room to talk for themselves. He quotes liberally, and fruitfully, from an unpublished Pops Staples memoir to which his children provided Kot access. And he also draws upon conversations with some of the family\u2019s good friends\u2014soul singer Jerry Butler, for instance, who grew up in the same Chicago neighborhood\u2014as well as with key collaborators and savvy observers, such as country singer Marty Stuart, Stax exec Al Bell, esteemed gospel critic Anthony Heilbut, and several others. Most of all, Kot relies upon interviews he\u2019s done with the surviving members of the family, Mavis in particular.", "That\u2019s a can\u2019t-fail narrative strategy. Mavis Staples is a gripping storyteller and has great stories to tell. There\u2019s the time, for instance, that young Mavis got a whipping for singing \u201cSince I Fell for You,\u201d a big R&B hit for Annie Laurie in 1947, at a school talent show. \u201cGrandma says, \u2018Oh, you singin\u2019 the blues, huh? You go out there and get me some switches.\u2019\u201d Or the tale of audience members wagering among themselves over whether the low, low lead vocals on early Staples records could actually be coming from Mavis, only a little girl at the time. Or the time she unwittingly integrated a Mississippi laundromat. Or dated Bob Dylan. And so on.", "Younger fans, who have necessarily discovered the Staples\u2019 one-of-a-kind gospel soul only recently, will embrace these stories, coming on nearly every page of", ", as revelations. Longtime followers will also enjoy hearing them, though they will be familiar from various newspaper and magazine profiles and from other soul and gospel books. Mavis does occasionally share with Kot some previously unknown and entertaining detail. \u201cThe Newport Folk Festival was our first kiss,\u201d she dishes about her relationship with Dylan. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone that.\u201d Mostly, though, to paraphrase Frank Rich in a recent", "on Stephen Sondheim, it appears that \u201cMavis has her story, and she\u2019s sticking to it.\u201d", "But a dearth of new anecdotes is not a significant problem. What I most crave from studies of this kind isn\u2019t detailed biography. What I want is a biographically focused examination of vital songs, performances, and recordings\u2014the things that made me eager to read about an artist in the first place. How does the music sound and feel? And, most importantly, how and why does the music matter?", "excels on that first score. Kot is an entertaining and informed tour guide of the highs and occasional lows of the Staples Singers catalog, and also of Mavis\u2019 remarkable series of 21", "-century solo recordings, cut with producers such as Ry Cooder and Jeff Tweedy.

That\u2019s where some guiding analytical principle, such as Craig Werner\u2019s Gospel Impulse, might have been enlightening.", "At the book\u2019s close, a 73-year-old Mavis Staples, her brother Pervis, and sister Yvonne walk, arms entwined, out of the church on the day of their late sister Cleotha\u2019s funeral as a choir sings \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There.\u201d \u201cTheir sister was gone,\u201d Kot writes, \u201cbut their work was not yet done.\u201d\u00a0 It is a moving moment, to put it mildly.

And she retells what clearly was a formative event in Plato\u2019s life: how Plato\u2019s mentor Socrates, through speech alone, came to be seen as so dangerous to Athenian society that he was put to death.", "What are Plato\u2019s contributions? Plato\u2019s own views are elusive because he never wrote in his own voice, only through characters speaking in dialogue. But just as we do not look to Shakespeare or Goethe for a well-defined political worldview, Goldstein suggests that the value lies not in Plato\u2019s particular proposals but in his questions and methodologies, the process in the dialogues by which ideas are considered, debated, and often rejected.", "The dominant character in almost all of Plato\u2019s dialogues is Socrates. He is hardly portrayed consistently across the dialogues, but we have several sources on the real Socrates, 40 years Plato\u2019s senior, whom Plato knew and clearly esteemed. Goldstein tells his story well, culminating in a moving and dramatic chapter, \u201cSocrates Must Die.\u201d Socrates, born in 469 B.C., was a self-declared \u201cgadfly\u201d in Athens while incessant wars between city-states were causing Greek society to self-destruct. Socrates acquired a vivid public reputation as a masterful debater who could poke holes in anyone\u2019s beliefs, while maintaining that he himself was sure of nothing but his own ignorance. After the temporary downfall of Athenian democracy and a takeover by the so-called Thirty Tyrants, the restored democracy put Socrates on trial in 399 B.C. for what may or may not have been trumped-up charges: disrespecting the gods and corrupting the youth. The jury found him guilty and sentenced him to death, and Socrates drank the hemlock that killed him.", "Photo courtesy Stephen Pinker", "Plato chronicles Socrates\u2019 trial and death in a series of dialogues (the", "), but can they be trusted? I think it safe to say that Plato despised Athens for executing such a brilliant mind, and Plato\u2019s Socrates is meant at least partly as hagiography. It\u2019s easy to get behind Plato\u2019s Socrates as he demolishes the confused, empty piety of Euthyphro, or as he makes a noble case for virtue being its own reward. It might have been less easy to get behind the real Socrates, who encouraged some seriously troubled characters such as Alcibiades (who was also one of Socrates\u2019 lovers) and the tyrant Critias. Goldstein does not shirk from that question and spends quite a bit of time on bad boy Alcibiades, who seems to have combined the worst excesses of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and George S. Patton in helping to drive Athens to ruin. Yet Goldstein argues that Socrates was ultimately executed because he deferred to no one\u2019s authority and tore down Athens\u2019 idealized image of itself. In the claustrophobic public life of Athens, Socrates was tolerated (barely) when times were good, but condemned as a dangerous nuisance when things took a turn for the worse. When Leslie Gelb, reflecting on the rush to war in Iraq, spoke of the media and foreign policy experts\u2019 \u201c", ",\u201d he explained exactly why Socrates (who, like Plato, never took payment from students) was so irritating to the chattering classes of Athens: He ruined their credibility. His message, paraphrased by Goldstein as \u201cDon\u2019t be so hasty in donning yourselves with laurels,\u201d fits America all too well today.", "Plato, then, took Socrates\u2019 critical attitude and generalized it beyond morality and politics to the search for truth in all its forms. Plato may lack the scientific trappings of Aristotle, such as they were, but he possessed one keen insight that Aristotle ignored, and, one that eventually proved crucial to the scientific mentality: Our senses lie. It is not just enough to question our received cultural ideas and our intuitions; the most self-evident truths around us may prove to be nothing of the kind. The classic example is, of course, that the Earth goes around the sun and not the other way around, something we now take for granted but which still goes counter to every bit of visual evidence we possess.

He examines it from every angle, bringing to bear a formidable array of analytical instruments\u2014philosophy, poetry, physics, science fiction, and psychology. It wouldn\u2019t be right to suggest that the book had anything so straightforwardly utilitarian as a bottom line, but the overall impression I got from it is that no one\u2014least of all practitioners of the hard sciences\u2014has any definitive answers on what time is, or in what sense it can actually be said to exist. Gleick is particularly good on the extent to which our understanding of time is reflective of\u2014as opposed to merely reflected by\u2014the words we use to talk about it. The language of spatial measurement and movement, he suggests, forces us to conceive of our experience of time in a particular way: \u201cWho was the first person to say that time \u2018passes\u2019 or \u2018flows\u2019? We are seldom conscious of the effect of language on our choice of metaphors, the effect of our metaphors on our sense of reality. Usually we give the words no thought at all. When we do, we may well wonder what we\u2019re really saying.\u201d", "Like the faithful student of Borges he is, Gleick is an acute observer of the feedback loop that exists between fantasy and reality, the way in which science and fiction mutually inform one another.

Gleick is, above all, a gifted synthesizer of difficult materials, a writer who can draw together disparate cultural fragments\u2014from Marcel Proust to Niels Bohr, from the introduction of daylight saving time to Philip K. Dick, from William James to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2014into a rich and complex whole. He doesn\u2019t make a great deal of the point, but it\u2019s hard to avoid the overall impression of science and philosophy and poetry and fiction as one great human grasp at comprehension, at making sense of the vast and unknowable universe in which we find ourselves. What makes him so engaging as a science writer is his distinctly nonjingoistic stance in relation to other ways of thinking about the world. \u201cThe computers in our thought experiments,\u201d as he puts it toward the end of the book, \u201cif not always the computers we own, are deterministic because people have designed them that way.

Although he situates it historically, he has very little to say about the deep emotional resonances of the subject, the melancholy human heart that beats beneath the technological fantasy of thwarting time\u2019s relentless unidirectionality. And this is of a piece, I think, with the book\u2019s hyperactive erudition: He tends to progress from synopsizing the plot of a novel to sketching scientific theory to compressing a philosophical argument, without ever pausing to do much in the way of contemplation himself.

And although she is undeniably a powerful and scrupulously thoughtful writer both of intellectual and private history, the balance ends up feeling like an unfortunate choice.", "Isometric Studio", "The sections in the past are for the most part much more interesting than those in the present. Esperanto came out of the idealistic late 19", "century, from a thinker who had previously been attached to another utopian concept of this time\u2014Zionism. Zamenhof, born in 1859, was originally a nationalist who argued that Jews should create a settlement in America. But, frustrated with nascent state-building efforts in Palestine, he began envisioning a larger project that would protect Jews from violence by joining all people together under the beacon of a new neutral language. Publishing his first description of Esperanto in 1887, Zamenhof argued that Jews should adopt a set of humanistic cultural beliefs he dubbed \u201cHillelism\u201d after the first-century B.C. Rabbi Hillel (he later changed the name to Homaranismo).", "These ideals would replace the seemingly outmoded religious traditions that, in his mind, kept the Jews subservient to Russian mainstream culture. Zamenhof hoped an invented tongue\u2014one \u201cunlimitedly rich, flexible, full of every \u2018bagatelle\u2019 which gives life to language, beautiful-sounding, and extraordinarily easy\u201d\u2014would connect Jews to the rest of humanity.", "It\u2019s perhaps not surprising, given this ambitious and complicated mission, that Zamenhof ran into trouble nearly right off the bat. French intellectuals loved Esperanto\u2014but anti-Semitism was ferocious in the post-Dreyfus era, and when Zamenhof staged a conference in Boulogne, France, in 1906, his local fans concealed his Jewishness from the press. Zamenhof tussled with many of the popularizers of Esperanto, who downplayed the nonlinguistic aspects of his program or made language reforms that he deemed unnecessary. And yet, uncharacteristically for founders of a new nation, linguistic or otherwise, Zamenhof was intent on allowing speakers of Esperanto to make their own choices about what the language should mean, as well as how it should be used: \u201cI am leaving each person to clarify for himself the essence of the idea [of Esperanto], as he wishes,\u201d he said in a 1907 speech.", "Schor argues for the \u201cheroism\u201d of this decision, and this seems right. Zamenhof wasn\u2019t just performing a George Washington\u2013style abdication of power; he was also allowing the language to evolve much like a living language. Esperantists have remarkable control over how they speak the tongue, and\u2014at least according to Schor\u2019s book\u2014spend a lot of time arguing over the many different ways of saying things like \u201ccluster bomb\u201d or \u201cmake-up artist.\u201d Speakers of Esperanto have also had tremendous freedom to promote a wide range of causes, from Marxism to civil rights to feminism to Baha\u2019i to Chinese Communism. Esperanto\u2019s ability to contain such ideological multitudes partially accounts for the suspicion with which repressive governments have long viewed it. Under Stalin, Esperanto speakers\u2014who had originally been supported by the Soviets \u2014were purged and sent to the gulag as spies. The Nazis attacked Esperanto groups in Germany and banned it outright in 1940, viewing the language as a Trojan horse for sinister Jewish and Bolshevik interests.", "Zamenhof was intent on allowing speakers of Esperanto to make their own choices about what the language should mean.", "During the Cold War, Esperanto was still viewed as a potential threat by many right-wing governments and in the McCarthy-era United States. The U.S. Army assigned the language and Esperanto symbols to a punching-bag enemy called \u201cAggressor\u201d in training exercises and PR films. Under attack, membership dwindling, the Esperanto movement struggled with a number of existential questions, not all of which have been resolved today. Was Zamenhof\u2019s original goal of universality still relevant, when English had emerged as the semiofficial language of international government and commerce? Could Esperanto speakers come up with different\u2014perhaps more amusing\u2014goals? What was the ideology of Esperanto, anyway: anti-fascism, neutrality, women\u2019s rights? Was the point really about ideology at all or just about people from around the world joining to speak a neutral language together? Manifestos were written, attacked, discarded.

{"Body": ["Anton Corbijn", "When reading a novelist\u2019s memoir, it\u2019s easy to retroactively psychoanalyze their characters through the lens of the author\u2019s childhood. Generally this is inadvisable; fiction is a glorious playground, which can be explored free of whatever one\u2019s parents did or failed to do. But the true lover of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s work must make an exception for his memoir", "The towering, bombastic, infuriatingly charismatic Ronnie, le Carr\u00e9\u2019s terrible (and mostly blessedly absentee) father, is the the chain that runs through each of the slightly disjointed tales that make up the book, despite le Carr\u00e9\u2019s desire to confine him to a single chapter. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him elbowing his way to the top of the hill,\u201d le Carr\u00e9 explains, but there he arrives, just the same. He describes his father as \u201ca crisis addict, a performance addict, a shameless pulpit orator and a scene-grabber.\u201d Ronnie beat up his mother, and he beat up le Carr\u00e9 himself, and spent much of his life in and out of prison (rubbing elbows with, among other notorious London lowlifes of the era, the Kray twins).", "The case has been made by many writers, including le Carr\u00e9 himself, that his heroes (especially the great George Smiley) are largely a reaction to James Bond, who le Carr\u00e9", "\u201ca neo-fascist gangster.\u201d Smiley is short, fat, and bald, repeatedly cuckolded by his young and beautiful wife. Karla, Smiley\u2019s antagonist, is himself an ascetic monk of a man, pulling no triggers, presiding instead like a puppet-master over a vast network of spies and operatives. In a genre where our hero typically tricks the villain into monologuing, it\u2019s notable that Smiley\u2019s first encounter with Karla (there will be only two) results in Smiley himself monologuing disastrously while Karla sits in dead silence.", "Certainly an anti-Bond, then, but the memoir reveals him also to be an anti-Ronnie. It\u2019s Ronnie who lived in hotels and squats, juggling identities and leaving secret families and girlfriends in his wake, Ronnie who drove fast cars and was quick with his fists and his verbal sparring. It\u2019s no accident that George Smiley fails on every level to rise to the standards we have come to expect from our spy heroes. The most tense moments in the le Carr\u00e9 oeuvre involve, at most, riffling through a desk or replacing one document with another. Smiley does much of his work in the back of a taxi, or sitting at home, deep in thought.", "Generally speaking, people who dislike le Carr\u00e9 novels find them boring. I too find them boring, but gloriously so. You may pick up", "in hopes of learning more about le Carr\u00e9\u2019s own background in intelligence, and you will be mildly disappointed. His novels already contain anything of interest one might want on that score, and what remains are the dullest realities of espionage: the interminable waiting in uninteresting towns, the attempt to build relationships with low-level functionaries who may or may not someday be of use, years of tedium punctuated with single moments of abject terror. Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s own career in the field ended when his identity was burned by Kim Philby, the notorious member of the Cambridge Five, an incident to which he devotes very little space. More delicious is the detail that in 1987, in Moscow, a mutual friend offered to introduce le Carr\u00e9 to Philby, who was then both dying and engaged in writing the second volume of his memoirs. Philby had hoped that le Carr\u00e9 would help him do so, a suggestion so absurd that le Carr\u00e9 feels no need to emphasize it other than a flat \u201cI declined to meet him.\u201d", "His friendships with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and his deeper relationship with Alec Guinness receive similarly brief air time. Le Carr\u00e9 was concerned when Burton was cast as Alec Leamas: \u201cHow on earth will this beautiful, thunderous, baritone Welsh voice and this overpowering Triple Alpha Male talent fit inside the character?\u201d His relief while watching Burton undergo the transformation of shrinking himself down to the role is palpable; however bankable, a le Carr\u00e9 hero must leave bombast and machismo at the door. Le Carr\u00e9 knows plenty about the trappings of toxic masculinity and has rejected it.", ", fundamentally, is an exercise in self-knowledge; the audience being himself as much as devoted followers like me. Even the title underscores this point, deriving from a shooting range in Monte Carlo stocked with game birds to which Ronnie once took le Carr\u00e9 while on a gambling binge. The pigeons who were not killed by the guns of the shooters promptly returned to the tunnels that confined them, despite having every chance to fly off.", "\u201cQuite why this image has haunted me for so long,\u201d le Carr\u00e9 writes, \u201cis something the reader is perhaps better able to judge than I am.\u201d", "", "Nicole Cliffe has written for the", ", the", ", and the Awl Network, and was the co-creator of the", ".", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Nattie Coombes, 12, was cast as an innocent follower, in thrall to his older brother\u2019s commanding personality. After the stabbing, Robert rifled his mother\u2019s possessions for the household cash, then took Nattie on a spending spree that involved taxi rides and several cricket matches. The \u201cmaniac\u201d he brought into the house turned out to be John Fox, a simple-minded odd-jobs man sometimes hired by the boys\u2019 parents who helped Robert pawn valuables and otherwise provided adult cover.

(Must we read the place of residence and family situation of every policeman who played a more-than-passing role in the case?) Many of the more lurid details of Emily Coombes\u2019 murder\u2014such as the full bushel\u2019s worth of maggots found on her decomposing body\u2014can be found on websites specializing in vintage crime. Most of these accounts, though, end with Robert\u2019s commitment to Broadmoor, a well-known prison for the criminally insane. There he was locked up with older men, killers of wives, children, business partners, and strangers\u2014including 12 other inmates who had murdered their mothers\u2014presumably for the rest of his life.", "What Summerscale learned, however, was that Broadmoor, a name shrouded with dread among Britons, operated under a remarkably progressive mandate during the early 20", "century. The setting was pastoral (if secure), and inmates were allowed to cultivate private gardens, keep libraries (if they could afford them), play cricket, and perform in the asylum band. For a city boy like Robert, the place was, Summerscale writes, \u201cboth gaol and sanctuary, fortress and enchanted castle.\u201d Because Robert was so young, he was kept among the best-educated and best-behaved members of the prison populations. He learned to play three musical instruments and chess well enough to rank in a tournament. He was also trained as a tailor. After 17 years, at the age of 30, he was deemed sane enough to release. He lived in a Salvation Army colony for a while, then immigrated to Australia, following his brother, Nattie.", "As Summerscale sees it, the rest of Robert\u2019s life\u2014unknown before this book\u2014answered most of her questions about his crime. Not every reader will agree, but she makes a persuasive argument. As an \u00e9migr\u00e9, he finally found both the travel and the adventure he once dreamed of, although of an unenviably grim variety; Summerscale follows him, during World War I, from Gallipoli to the Somme. And in an anything-but-superfluous epilogue that begins with the observation that contemporary armchair diagnosticians would probably peg Robert as a psychopath, she finally steps into the narrative herself. She recounts how a single vital clue led her to the discovery of the last chapter of Robert\u2019s life in rural Australia. In the book\u2019s moving concluding scene, she gets to shake hands with a 95-year-old man who actually knew her subject, and knew him well. What he has to tell her suggests that there are many mysteries in human nature that we\u2019ll never conclusively solve, and not all of them are horrors.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!

We often fail to understand the beauty of medieval art, he argued, because we experience the world and our place in it so differently from the people of that time. We can\u2019t appreciate medieval allegory until we make a concerted effort to imagine what it was like to inhabit the world as they saw it, as a divinely ordered universe in which \u201ccertain sympathies, antipathies, and strivings [are] inherent in matter itself.\u00a0 Everything has its right place, its home, the region that suits it.\u201d", "Lewis traces the origins of allegory to a period in late antiquity when, for undetermined reasons, the Western concept of a virtuous life changed profoundly. In the", "Aristotle described virtue as a skill to be learned by practice, until it becomes not just second nature, but an end in itself. \u201cThe man who does not enjoy doing noble actions is not a good man at all,\u201d he wrote.

We must feel that the scene by the fountain is an imaginative likeness of the lover\u2019s experience.\u201d We must be able to see the sparkling water and the shining eyes at the same time and recognize them to be facets of a singular, layered understanding that includes the recognition of other, abstract qualities as well, such as the purity of her spirit.", "The literate people of the Middle Ages were experts at comprehending art in this way. They routinely compounded vast amounts of meaning into certain ideas or motifs, partly because they were always attempting to integrate the cultural legacy of classical paganism into Christian theology.

I had a different idea in mind, something about mothers and daughters, something more traditionally structured. I had hoped to go to the central region of Ghana, which is where my mother\u2019s side of the family was from. I had never really spent much time there. \u2026 But then a friend came to visit, and we decided to go to Cape Coast Castle on a whim. And while I was there, I took the tour, and the tour guide was talking about how British soldiers used to marry the local women, which is something I had never heard about before.", "Exactly.

And then he took us down to the dungeons, so you get that very literal upstairs-downstairs thing.

And I think during my time in Iowa what I realized was that I was more interested in kind of getting to look at the ways that slavery and colonialism changed really subtly over a very long period of time. And so once I realized the book was more about time than about the other things, I decided that this structure that the book currently has would be a better way to go.", "One of the reasons that I felt like the book was about time was that I wanted to talk about how the moments that we are dealing with in the present didn\u2019t just appear out of nowhere.

It is not something I would have been interested in if I had not lived in America or had not grown up in Alabama, where you get to see the result of what all of that is.

I remember that every time we would move to a new place my dad would take the phonebook and look for Ghanaian-sounding last names and just call them to try and build the community wherever he was.

From the founding of the Jamestown settlement to the present day, Isenberg insists, America has always had a class hierarchy and has never offered equal opportunity to all (white) comers. A history professor at Louisiana State University, she writes, \u201cMost colonizing schemes that took root in 17", "- and 18", "-century British America were built on privilege and subordination, not any kind of proto-democracy.\u201d The rich, powerful and well-connected men behind those schemes stocked their ships and settlements with \u201cexpendable people\u2014waste people,\u201d typically indentured servants bound to work off the price of their passage, workers who could be used up in taming the wilderness. The authorities back in England welcomed such plans as a way to drain Britain of its human dregs: convicts, vagrants, the orphaned children of paupers. If the hard work didn\u2019t redeem them, the hard conditions would eliminate them.", "Tapping into scores of sources, Isenberg traces the emergence of the white-trash stereotype from its roots in British beliefs that the working class was truly a separate race from the middle and upper classes: congenitally stupid, lazy and shiftless\u2014when they weren\u2019t sly and conniving. Poverty, in the form of miserable living conditions, dirtiness, ignorance, illness, violence, and despair, was viewed as the inherited misfortune of blighted bloodlines. Isenberg shows how consistent this prejudice has been over the centuries, carrying on with only a few alterations", ".", "The first few chapters of", "can be heavy sledding due to the density of information and occasional clumsiness of Isenberg\u2019s prose.

He lacked \u201cstatesmanlike qualities\u201d and he failed even to defend his lower-class constituency from the depredations of the upper crust. But the fact that \u201cJackson did not look or act like a conventional politician,\u201d Isenberg writes, \u201cwas a fundamental part of his appeal.\u201d He was boastful and overbearing, not \u201ca government minion or a pampered courtier,\u201d an outsider who promised to clean up Washington corruption by the bluntest methods available. As one of his enemies wrote, \u201cboisterous in ordinary conversation, he makes up in oaths what he lacks in arguments.\u201d A ruthless and successful general, Jackson was \u201cquick to resent any who disagreed with him,\u201d and eschewed reasoned debate in favor of challenging his opponents to duels.", "This, of course, sounds awfully familiar. If", "is rather weak at weaving its assorted elements into a coherent narrative, it sheds bright light on a long history of demagogic national politicking, beginning with Jackson. It makes Donald Trump seem far less unprecedented than today\u2019s pundits proclaim. When it came to reining in the big landowners, Jackson betrayed the economic interests of working-class whites but won their favor all the same by prosecuting a brutal Native American removal policy, targeting unpopular, powerless \u201cbarbarians.\u201d His rough ways endeared him to the humble folk whose interests he couldn\u2019t be bothered to defend. When opponents ridiculed his partisans for their lack of \u201ctaste and breeding,\u201d it only sweetened his victories in that constituency\u2019s eyes.", "One of Andrew Jackson\u2019s enemies wrote, \u201cboisterous in ordinary conversation, he makes up in oaths what he lacks in arguments.\u201d", "Jackson employed what Isenberg dubs the \u201cArkansas Traveller\u201d strategy for winning over the white rural poor.

It\u2019s only after the slicker proves his down-home cred by picking up a fiddle and sawing out a hillbilly tune that the squatter welcomes him and provides what he needs. Generations of politicians would follow this formula by posing for photos with hogs, or mules, or crooning hill-country ballads to win votes.

In place of a martial career spent whuppin\u2019 redcoats, Trump crows about his prowess in the battlefield of business. He manfully rejects the lily-livered politesse of the snooty, educated classes who look down on him and his followers. His policies matter less than his personal style, because his selling point is not what he will accomplish but who he will gleefully offend and bulldoze. Instead of dutifully adopting upper-class tastes and decorum, he is, like Elvis, empowered by his wealth to flaunt his vulgarity. Even the springboard of his fame among the white working-class\u2014reality television\u2014is one of the few mass-culture arenas where rednecks can win renown just for being their unapologetically trashy selves.", "And, like Jackson and his successors, Trump has singled out dark-skinned others as a threat to the American way of life. White Trash\u00a0is weakest in its handling of race, a theme intimately entangled with the notion of a white-trash identity, but a subject Isenberg avoids when at all possible. Slavery was an institution that benefited rich plantation owners to the catastrophic disadvantage of small farmers and free laborers; it made the rich richer and the poor poorer. The Confederate Army, which granted service exemptions to slaveholders and other elite Southern whites, consisted largely of subsistence farmers and other workers expected to fight to preserve the very economic system that had kept them down. Many deserted. One Alabama recruit said, \u201cThey think all you are fit for is to stop bullets for them, your betters, who call you poor white trash.\u201d Many of those so-called betters ranked poor white trash as equivalent to, if not lower than, slaves. After the war, two-thirds of the farmers who worked the South\u2019s land under the bone-breaking, dead-end system of sharecropping were poor whites.", "Yet, for all that the South\u2019s white underclass resented the elites, they nevertheless allowed themselves, in great numbers, to be manipulated into believing that blacks and other people of color were their real enemies. Even politicians who identified and sympathized with poor whites found this exasperating. President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose Great Society program focused on helping not only urban blacks but also the crushingly impoverished whites of Appalachia, told a reporter, \u201cIf you can convince the lowest white man he\u2019s better than the best colored man, he won\u2019t notice you\u2019re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\u201d", "Isenberg clearly means", "to be a rebuke for generations of middle- and upper-class Americans who write off poor rural whites as worthless and blame their miserable, marginalized existence not on poverty and civic neglect but on bad genes and weak character.", "during the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998 when she called Bill Clinton \u201cour first black president,\u201d the attributes Clinton\u2019s haters found so revoltingly white-trash about him\u2014\u201csingle-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald\u2019s-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\u201d\u2014replicate the \u201ctropes of blackness.\u201d In addition to being slapped with virtually the same stereotypes, poor blacks and poor whites have, as Isenberg observes, \u201csimilar economic interests.\u201d But the one trait now most commonly associated with white trash\u2014overt, vicious racism\u2014keeps them at odds.", "\"Yet, for all that the South\u2019s white underclass resented the elites, they nevertheless allowed themselves, in great numbers, to be manipulated into believing that blacks and other people of color were their real enemies.", "", "", "", "", "Writing for the", "after the June 2015 mass shooting that killed nine black worshippers from a Charleston, South Carolina, church, Frank Guan", "that the murderer would most likely be called \u201cwhite trash.\u201d", "This, he argued, allows higher-status whites to ignore the structural nature of white supremacy and to pretend that \u201canti-black racism is purely the province of accented simpletons in greasy overalls.\u201d While this argument is true, it misses how easily the formula reverses itself, how the overt racism expressed by underclass whites gives educated, middle-class Americans permission to disregard the entrenched deprivation, fear, and hopelessness that foments it.

When the work of clarifying the meaning is already done by the narrator, these reader-listeners find a whole new level of enjoyment in those texts.", ": I imagine historical fiction represents a particular challenge in your line of work.

But Henry actually was ridiculed (in private, of course) for having a rather high-pitched tone, and Mantel mentions this in the novel. So I had to find something that was distinctive enough to be ridiculed by other characters but still not sound cartoonish. I have had nothing but fun creating the voices of Dickens\u2019 and Trollope\u2019s characters. I am an actor, and I rely on my instincts much of the time. I don\u2019t always plan how these people are going to sound. I often absorb who they are and see what comes out when I open my mouth.

I suppose writing is a bit like that, in that an author is drawing on a kind of pictorial reservoir rather than simply a verbal one, and I think soundscapes are also part of this process of invention.", "Although your book is fictional, it is based on certain truths that you must have uncovered about society at the time.

Put a zipper on a medieval bodice, and your novel will be thrown across the room! There\u2019s a whole gleeful genre of anachronism-hunting among readers and even authors of historical fiction that can be quite intimidating for new writers in this mode. I suppose the research has come more naturally to me given my academic work in medieval studies, and I knew a lot of general information about the period going in, of course. But what really surprised and in fact delighted me was my ignorance about a lot of the details of daily life: what a middle-class woman in medieval England would eat for breakfast, for example, or what sorts of items you\u2019d find in a kitchen.", "I particularly enjoyed the process of discovery that came with the part of the story told in installments taken from a letter.

Yet it also contains the secret to the story as a whole, explaining the background of the manuscript (the \u201cburnable book\u201d) and the emotional investment it inspires on the part of the characters. Originally I wrote this internal narrative as a new Canterbury tale, complete with a prologue in decasyllabic couplets, imagining Chaucer writing it all up after the fact, but I ended up with the simpler solution of embedding it as a letter that tells the crucial backstory.

By far the biggest risk posed by the HFT industry, for instance, is the risk of the kind of event we saw during the flash crash, only much, much worse. The stock market is an insanely complex system, which can fail in unpredictable and catastrophic ways; the HFT industry only serves to make it much more brittle and perilous than it already was.

If, that is, they\u2019re on the list at all.", "If your mom has a brokerage account, or a mutual fund manager, or generally entrusts her retirement savings to any kind of intermediary, then the fees charged by her broker or fund manager will dwarf any profits being skimmed from her by HFT.

And if you\u2019re making your own decisions of what to buy and sell, and at exactly what price, then there is no room to blame anybody but yourself if you make bad decisions. The trading fees and the stock prices, for individual investors, are all completely transparent.", "If you\u2019re a big investor, that\u2019s not the case. Brad Katsuyama, when he was at Royal Bank of Canada, would see thousands of shares available for sale at a certain price\u2014but when he tried to buy them, they would suddenly disappear, and he would be forced to pay more. That was the high-frequency traders, front-running his order.", "Retail investors don\u2019t run into this problem. If they see a stock available for $50.00, they can buy it at $50.00\u2014not $50.01 or anything higher. They get exactly what they want, at exactly the price they want, which is also the best price in the market, and they get it immediately, in a way that makes big investors rather jealous. (Which raises one of my factual quibbles with the book: On Page 78, Lewis says that a retail order was filled \u201cat a higher price than originally listed\u201d; I don\u2019t believe it. I believe that the stock-market price rose as soon as the retail order was placed; I don\u2019t believe that the retail order itself got front-run.)", "If your mom or your pop buys or sells a stock, that order will almost certainly never make its way to any stock exchange: It will be filled by a high-frequency trading shop that is happy to pay good money for the privilege of doing so. The high-frequency traders do make money from the retail investors\u2014but mainly they do so the old-fashioned way, just by being on the right side of the trade.", "If an HFT shop simply fills every single retail order at the best price in the market, then over the course of a day, and certainly over the course of a year, it will make a decent profit. Retail investors, in aggregate, are dumb money: If you take the opposite side of their trades, you\u2019re going to do just fine. Especially when you also buy stock off them for a penny or two less than you will sell the same stock to them. That\u2019s called NBBO\u2014the national best bid/offer\u2014and it simply reflects the fact that there\u2019s always a small gap between the highest price that someone is willing to buy, and the lowest price that someone is willing to sell.", "That\u2019s why HFTs love to give retail investors what they want: It turns out that retail investors are very good at making very bad decisions all on their own. What\u2019s more, if you\u2019re an HFT seeing what retail is doing at any given moment, you can use that information to inform your stock-market trades elsewhere. So mom and pop end up making you a lot of money, without your ripping them off in the slightest.", "If you read Lewis\u2019 book with the eyes of a retail investor, it can get quite confusing. At one point, for instance, Lewis tells the story of Rich Gates, a mutual fund manager being front-run by HFTs. Gates \u201cdevised a test,\u201d writes Lewis, to see whether he was \u201cgetting ripped off by some unseen predator.\u201d The test involved placing two orders, a few seconds apart: The first would be an order to buy 1,000 shares of a certain thinly traded stock at $100.05, and then the second would be an order to", "1,000 shares of exactly the same stock at $100.01. Gates \u201cwas dutifully shocked\u201d when he discovered the results of his test: He ended up buying the stock at $100.05, selling it at $100.01, and losing 4 cents per share. \u201cThis,\u201d he thought, \u201cobviously is not right.\u201d", "Lewis does have a point here: It\u2019s not right. (Whether it\u2019s", "not right rather depends on how familiar you are with stock-market protocols.) If the stock market works the way it\u2019s meant to work, then the stock exchange\u2019s order-matching algorithms should have seen that the best bid, at $100.05, was higher than the best offer, at $100.01. They then should have matched the two, so that Gates would have traded with himself, and lost no money. Instead, a fast algorithm managed to insert itself between the two orders, buying at $100.01, selling at $100.05, and making a 4-cent profit for itself, in a fraction of a second. In terms of the official ticker tape, rather than one trade taking place at $100.03, there were two trades: one at $100.01, and another at $100.05.", "In Gates\u2019 mind, what he saw was the 35,000 customers of his mutual fund being \u201cexposed to predation\u201d in the stock market. Between them, those customers had lost $40: 4 cents per share, times 1,000 shares. Which means they had lost roughly a tenth of a cent apiece, buying and selling $100,000 of Chipotle Mexican Grill within the space of a few seconds.", "But there\u2019s always going to be a nonzero \u201cround-trip cost\u201d to buying $100,000 of a stock and then selling it a few seconds later. And it was not so long ago that $40 would be a veritable bargain for such a trade. Gates has good reason to feel preyed upon, given the way the market is supposed to work. But still, $40 for two $100,000 trades is hardly a rip-off. Especially when you consider the money that Gates himself is charging his 35,000 mom-and-pop customers.", "When Gates was running his experiments, his flagship fund, the TFS Market Neutral Fund, had an expense ratio of 2.41 percent: For every, say, $100,000 you had invested in the fund, you would pay Gates and his colleagues a fee of $2,410 per year. That helps puts the tenth of a cent you might lose on Gates\u2019 Chipotle test into a certain amount of perspective. TFS trades frequently, but even so, any profits that HFT algos might be making off its trades are surely a tiny fraction of the fees that TFS charges its own investors.", "When Gates was running his experiment, the official national best bid/offer on those hypothetical Chipotle shares was $100.00 to $100.10. A retail investor could have bought 100 shares of Chipotle for $10,010, and then sold them immediately for $10,000. The total round-trip cost would be just $10, plus whatever the trading fee might be\u2014maybe another $5. That\u2019s amazingly cheap execution, which would involve no HFT front-running at all. If the retail investor could buy at $10,005 and sell at $10,001\u2014as Gates did\u2014that would have been even cheaper. Which means that from a retail investor\u2019s point of view,", "is getting a bargain. For all that Gates feels aggrieved, the stock market remains a very efficient place to move around enormous sums of money.", "HFT divvies up intermediation revenues between banks, exchanges, telecom outfits, and algo-driven shops.", "is in on the game.", "At some points in his book, Lewis realizes this. He says that stock-market intermediaries have always made money by ripping off investors: \u201cthe entire history of Wall Street was the story of scandals,\u201d he writes, \u201clinked together tail to trunk like circus elephants.\u201d Front-running has always been around. At other points in the book, however, Lewis starts getting weirdly nostalgic for the stock market of the past. The U.S. stock market, he says, was once \u201cthe world\u2019s most public, most democratic, financial market.\u201d", "were these halcyon days? Lewis never says. Back in 2000, Goldman Sachs spent $6.5 billion buying a stock exchange market-maker named Spear, Leeds & Kellogg; today, thanks to HFT, that investment is largely worthless. The $6.5 billion gives you an idea of how profitable market-making was just a decade and a half ago\u2014and yet Lewis is comfortable claiming that by 2008, the HFT shops were \u201cmaking perhaps more money than people have ever made on Wall Street.\u201d", "\u201cFinancial intermediation is a tax on capital,\u201d writes Lewis, accurately. \u201cThis new beast rose up in the middle of the market and the tax increased\u2014by billions of dollars.\u201d But even if you accept that HFT generates billions of dollars, that doesn\u2019t mean it generates billions of dollars", "than intermediation generated in the past. For the sake of larding his rhetoric with maximal outrage, Lewis is drifting into the arena of highly dubious claims. After all, in the past, stocks traded in units of eighth of a dollar; today, they trade down to the penny. That alone has cost intermediaries\u2014and saved investors\u2014billions of dollars.", "The problem with", ", at heart, is that Lewis is too wedded to his narrative of a rigged stock market. The word \u201cfraud\u201d appears in three different places in the book; at one point it\u2019s explicitly attached to the possibility that \u201centerprising politicians and plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and state attorneys general\u201d might \u201crespond to that news\u201d with entrepreneurial activity of their own. And indeed that\u2019s exactly what seems to be happening: A", "of", "and", "have responded to the release of Lewis\u2019 book with dark hints that insider-trading prosecutions might be coming down the pike.", "But what we\u2019re seeing, in the world of HFT, is not fraud, nor is it insider trading. Rather, HFT is a ridiculously and unnecessarily complicated mechanism for divvying up intermediation revenues between banks, exchanges, high-tech telecommunications outfits, and various algo-driven shops.", "is in on the game: not just the HFT guys, but also the exchanges, which optimize themselves for HFT game-playing, and the banks, which let HFTs into their dark pools, and especially the SEC, which has been cheering on the whole motley crew from the beginning. Even the big money managers are in on the act. Because they pass on their trading costs to their investors, managers have precious little incentive to chase aggressively after the very best execution on their trades. Rather than routing trades to the brokers (like Katsuyama\u2019s former employer, Royal Bank of Canada) who will get them the best price, they embrace the mildly corrupt \u201csoft dollar\u201d system, and pay brokers with trade flow in return for access to analysts and research.", "Prosecutors are powerful creatures, of course, and if they want to bring charges against some HFT shop, they probably will. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that behavior which was broadly accepted on Wall Street suddenly became", ". Lewis claims that he would rather see a market solution to the HFT problem: He would prefer to see IEX become a success than see a group of high-frequency traders go to jail. But by writing his book in such an incendiary manner, he has certainly done his best to maximize the probability of the latter. Policymakers and prosecutors find themselves in something of a pickle\u2014precisely because", "is so good at boiling its readers\u2019 blood.", "Michael Lewis, unlike HFT\u2019s defenders, has his finger on the popular pulse. That\u2019s why he spends so much time detailing the work that went into building a fast fiber-optic cable between Chicago and New York, and explaining the gory details of co-location, where HFT companies place their computer servers as physically close to the stock exchanges as possible, just so that their orders can arrive precious microseconds ahead of the competition\u2019s. He\u2019s not talking to Wall Street, here; he\u2019s not even talking to prosecutors. He\u2019s talking to the general public.", "On Wall Street, it has been long understood that speed is money. That truism dates back much further than HFT; my own employer, Reuters, is named after a farsighted man who made his millions selling ultra-fast information in the 19", "century. The general public, by contrast, believes that the stock market is a democratic level playing field. It never has been, but the SEC does its best to preserve the fiction that it is. Hence rules like Regulation FD, which mandates that companies release information simultaneously to everybody, so that, at least in theory, every investor has an equal shot at trading on that information and making money from it.", "In practice, by the time any such information has begun to load in your Web browser, it\u2019s too late: The price has already moved.

There is a superb piece in which Jamison attends a gathering of people who suffer, or feel that they suffer, from something called Morgellons Disease, a delusional condition whereby things\u2014often colored fibers or crystals or threads, and sometimes tiny living creatures\u2014are imagined to emerge through the skin from inside of the body. There is an essay on the West Memphis Three, who were wrongfully imprisoned in the 1990s for the supposed ritual murder of three young boys. There\u2019s a long essay-manifesto on the difficulties of writing about female suffering\u2014on the ease with which it can be dismissed as a clich\u00e9, and the necessity of doing so regardless. Running through all of this, stitching it together, is a strong thread of autobiographical narrative, which becomes a sort of artful self-portraiture of Jamison\u2019s own scarring\u2014from an abortion, from a violent mugging in Nicaragua, from a history of eating disorder and bodily self-harm.", "The go-to clich\u00e9 for this kind of writing, or this kind of subject matter, would be \u201cunflinching.\u201d That would be inaccurate in this case, because while there\u2019s certainly a relentlessness to Jamison\u2019s pursuit of the topic of pain, she does flinch. In fact, one of the more powerful aspects of her writing is the extent to which she is able to flinch while maintaining the steadiness of her gaze.", "It\u2019s in Jamison\u2019s hyper-conscious flinching from herself that the real work of writing takes place.", "In the title piece, which also opens the collection, she writes about her work as a medical actor, paid to play a character suffering from a specific cluster of maladies, in order for medical students to hone their diagnostic skills. The essay becomes an exploration of the idea of empathy, of feeling your way into the suffering of another person and identifying personally with their pain. But Jamison\u2014whose first book,", ", was a novel\u2014goes beyond the standard literary self-congratulations, about how empathy requires the same sorts of imaginative leaps as reading and writing fiction, and how", ". Instead she asks, in various ways, whether empathy might not in fact be less about the person being identified with than the person doing the identifying.", "Jamison seems, at certain points, on the verge of being creeped out by her own capacity for imaginative identification. She writes about her brother contracting Bell\u2019s palsy, a condition which causes partial facial paralysis similar to the effects of a stroke, and of how she found herself obsessed with imagining her way into his experience. \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling toward my brother,\u201d she writes, \u201cso much as I was feeling toward a version of myself\u2014a self that didn\u2019t exist but theoretically shared his misfortune. I wonder if my empathy has always been this, in every case: just a bout of hypothetical self-pity projected onto someone else. Is this ultimately just solipsism?\u201d", "Photo by Colleen Kinder", "She wants an empathy that arises out of courage, but understands the extent to which it is, for her, always rooted in fear. Imagining the pain of others means flinching from it as though it were our own, out of a frightened sense that it could become our own. She refers to psychological studies in which fMRI scans have observed how the same kind of brain activity is provoked by the observation of other\u2019s physical pain as by the experience of one\u2019s own. She says that she feels heartened by this instinctive identification, but wonders what it might finally be good for. Much of the intellectual charge of Jamison\u2019s writing comes from the sense that she is always looking for ways to examine her own reactions to things; no sooner has she come to some judgment or insight than she begins searching for a way to overturn it, or to deepen its complications. She flinches, and then she explores that flinch with a steady gaze.", "Jamison is fascinated by the porousness of the borders between herself and others, and by the way in which that porousness can permit the smuggling in of something like solipsism. It\u2019s rare, and quite thrilling, to encounter a writer who so elegantly incorporates her own writerly anxieties into her work, who is so composed and confident about the value of her own self-doubt. (In this sense, her writing often recalls the work of David Foster Wallace, one of many influences she openly engages with throughout the collection.) Here she is, for instance, on the peculiar way she finds herself identifying with a woman named Dawn she meets at the Morgellons gathering:", "This kind of ambivalence, this doubling back on her own assumptions, is what makes Jamison such a wonderful essayist. What feels especially vital in this passage is the intensity of her self-interrogations, the dramatization of the resistance against her own literary instincts. It\u2019s in the space of these interruptions, in this hyper-conscious flinching from herself, that the real work of writing takes place. When the inevitable happens, and she starts to suspect that she might herself be starting to suffer from Morgellons\u2014the delusional nature of which she feels makes it all the more treacherously communicable\u2014she tries not to think about whether she is itching. \u201cI am trying not to take my skin for granted,\u201d she writes; it\u2019s a striking claim, certainly, but one that seems strangely commensurate with her aversion to any sort of complacency. What\u2019s most fascinating about this essay is not the strange phantom illness itself, or even the way in which she keeps almost helplessly metaphorizing it (despite the tutelary spirit of Susan Sontag hovering above her, warning her against doing so); it\u2019s the literary virtue she makes of her own necessary difficulties with both.", "Writers, as Joan Didion remarked, are always selling someone out, and this is a reality of which Jamison seems always to be sharply aware. Her sense of the suffering of the people she\u2019s writing about here is so acute that you can feel her willing herself to believe in that suffering in the same way they do. She portrays these people with a keenly affecting clarity and compassion. At one point, she\u2019s sitting behind a man named Paul who has lost interest in the presentation taking place in the room, and is looking at photographs of his own wounds on his laptop\u2014injuries of scratching and picking and scraping\u2014observing the evidence of his own torment. \u201cEven here,\u201d she writes, \u201camong others who identify with the same malady, he retreats into the terrible privacy of his own broken body. He brings others\u2014strangers, briefly\u2014into this quiet battleground, but it\u2019s always just him again, eventually, drawn back into the cloister of his damage, that nearly unfathomable loneliness.\u201d At the end of the essay, she returns to Paul, to her own guilt at writing about him and his fellow sufferers:", "It\u2019s obvious that", "wasn\u2019t conceived from the beginning as a single book project. There are subcutaneous connections running throughout, though they seem to result more from an organizing cluster of obsessions than any kind of willful effort to make a major statement about empathy.

Jamison\u2019s writing is often formally inventive, but never appears to be pursuing formal invention for its own sake; it\u2019s always a case, rather, of the material demanding some radical style of treatment, like a condition with no obvious cure. Jamison\u2019s essay \u201cMorphology of the Hit,\u201d for instance, could easily have been a schematic nightmare, but winds up being devastatingly effective. It\u2019s a short memoir about a time she spent in Nicaragua in her early 20s, during which she was mugged and savagely assaulted. The piece is modeled around the stringent formalism of Vladimir Propp, whose book", "isolated 31 plot elements, or \u201cfunctions,\u201d supposedly common to all Russian folklore. Jamison tries, and ultimately fails, to map out her experience along Propp\u2019s narrative coordinates. The essay\u2019s real brilliance is in its transcending its own cleverness through that failure. The problem of making sense of the experience, the nearly intractable difficulty of writing about it at all, becomes a vital part of that writing. \u201cThere is no function,\u201d she writes in the closing lines, \u201cdesignated for how this essay might begin to fill the lack or liquidate the misfortune\u2014replace the eyes, the heart, the daylight.

And for days after reading this beautiful and punishing book, I found that I myself was haunted by the phrase, but for a different reason. There is a type of person, after all, whose job it is to linger around the sites of injuries, to observe the damage we do to ourselves and to each other. \u201cWound dweller,\u201d I realized, is an apt and troubling synonym for \u201cwriter.\u201d", "---", "by Leslie Jamison.

The big one took place when she was asleep in a car with her brother and a friend in the cinematically named desert town of Lone Pine. In the wee hours, she wandered out onto the empty street alone, and\u2014well, as Ehrenreich writes, \u201cHere we leave the jurisdiction of language, where nothing is left but the vague gurgles of surrender expressed in words like \u2018ineffable\u2019 and \u2018transcendent\u2019 \u201d:", "Ehrenreich tried to bring it up with intimates a couple of times, once blurting out, \u201cI saw God,\u201d but that felt untrue and caused people to get awkward and change the subject.

She is as disdainful of organized religion as ever, writing that when people run up against the inexplicable they call it \u201c \u2018God,\u2019 as if that were some sort of explanation.\u201d And she insists that \u201cthe idea of a cosmic loving-kindness perfusing the universe is a serious, even potentially dangerous error.\u201d But she also seems to back away from her atheism, portraying it as just another arrogant belief system she inherited from her father, a man she sums up as the \u201cgreat man-god and Shiva-like genius of self destruction\u201d and a \u201chabitual liar.\u201d", "In fact, what she seems to be backing away from is certainty of all kinds in the face of genuine mystery.

Whitman, for one, described office workers as \u201ca slender and round-shouldered generation, of minute leg, chalky face, and hollow chest \u2026 trig and prim in great glow of shiny boots, clean shirts\u2014sometimes, just now, of extraordinary patterns, as if overrun with bugs!\u2014tight pantaloons, straps, which seem coming little into fashion again, startling cravats, and hair all soaked and \u2018slickery\u2019 with sickening oils.\u201d", "Adjust for some\u2014but only some\u2014changes in fashion and that passage could describe the put-together hipster or flashy banker you saw on the way to work today. You can take or leave the mockery (perhaps the description hits a little close to home), but Whitman\u2019s words undoubtedly still resonate. Saval\u2019s book accentuates the transformations that occurred as those weak and spindly office workers began to inherit the Earth, or at least the eight-hour workday. In 1880, less than 5 percent of the American workforce worked in nonmanual labor, although the number was much higher\u2014in the 20-40 percent rage\u2014in cities like Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Boston. As trade expanded across the country, the amount of clerical work increased. And as the number of people working in offices grew, the question arose of how to optimize efficiency and, in some cases, comfort in this new work climate.", "Throughout", ", we read about \u201cthe dream of a better office,\u201d but that phrase turns comical as we realize how little progress ever gets made.", "To start, Saval explains, many offices took a cue from the factory and lined desks up in long rows. Then, in the early 20", "century, two innovations emerged that would get recycled and reinterpreted in various ways over the next century. The first arrived courtesy of Frederick Taylor, a consultant and theorist who made it his goal to remove all inefficiencies from the office and argued for an extreme division of labor to replace what was the more fluid work style of the old clerks, who worked in small offices of four or five people and were responsible for a wide variety of tasks. Taylor created the position of the manager. As Saval writes:", "By separating knowledge from the basic work process \u2026 the ideology of Taylorism all but ensured a workplace divided against itself, both in space and in practice, with a group of managers controlling how work was done and their workers merely performing that work.", "Even as some offices today, particularly those in the tech industry, have attempted to move toward nonhierarchical models that recognize the benefit of idle, creative time, most still employ a version of this hierarchical, efficiency-driven system. The drive to get workers producing at highest capacity probably reached its apex with Robert Propst\u2019s Action Office in the 1960s. The Action Office was an open-concept space consisting of several different working spaces, including a desk that you sat at and a larger drafting table that you could stand over. Propst\u2019s second version of the Action Office, created after the first failed to gain traction in the marketplace, added walls of different heights around the workspace.", "Propst\u2019s ideas were received rapturously, heralded for finally allowing the office \u201cto achieve the work utopia that it had always promised.\u201d As Saval writes: \u201cMost office designs were about keeping people in place; Action Office was about movement. For in keeping with the ergonomic thinking that Propst had been doing for years, the motion of the body assisted\u2014corresponded to\u2014the ceaselessly inventive motion of the white-collar mind.\u201d", "The results, however, were hardly radical. The Action Office, which was meant to liberate workers and get them moving around the office, instead led directly to the proliferation of its stifling cousin-in-design: the cubicle.", "The same ironic story gets repeated with almost every grand design that Saval describes. Throughout", ", we read about \u201cthe dream of a better office,\u201d but that phrase and others like it turn comical as we realize how little progress ever gets made toward turning that dream into reality.", "That\u2019s not to say that nothing has changed about office life at all in the past century. Saval emphasizes how offices were, for much of the 20", "century, filled only with white men, an unfortunate reality that has slowly been reversed. But if the people doing the work have grown more diverse, any changes in how that work is actually done has tended toward the superficial, despite what the Taylors and Propsts of the world may have hoped.", ", Matthew Shaer wrote about the new trend of bossless offices, where hiring and firing is done through consensus and teams complete projects with little to no hierarchical supervision. The notion appears revolutionary, but as Shaer writes, the results are anything but. Shaer describes watching a group of workers at Menlo, one of the companies trying out the \u201cflattened office\u201d theory, and realizing that \u201chowever ostensibly egalitarian this Menlo work team was, in practice, a leader had quickly emerged, and everyone else was falling in line.\u201d", "As Shaer points out after, that doesn\u2019t take away from the project: \u201cThe triumph of the flattened office may be the creation of work environments in which leaders organically arise, and all employees feel a sense of ownership, whether real or imagined.\u201d For the kind of worker who fits in at Menlo at least, the process is less oppressive, but ultimately a hierarchy ends up appearing regardless, and from an outsider\u2019s perspective the work process is only slightly altered.", "Photo by Katrina Ohstrom", "Regardless of where it happens\u2014in a cubicle, an open-concept warehouse floor, or a coffee shop\u2014or how much personal freedom you have while doing it, office work has an underlying consistency. At its heart are basic and similar building blocks: assignments, projects, and deliverables spread out over, if you\u2019re lucky, an eight-hour day. Even the shift to freelancing is not as tectonic on a day-to-day basis as it can appear from the outside. In fact, the first thing you learn as a freelancer is that the freedom it offers is mostly a fantasy. The experience is similar to the scene in", "where Sally explains the false rationale behind deciding not to have kids with her boyfriend: \u201cJoe and I used to talk about it, and we'd say we were so lucky \u2026 we can have sex on the kitchen floor and not worry about the kids walking in.\u201d But of course, they never did. Freelancing in theory allows for impromptu midweek vacations and afternoon beers, but there\u2019s still 40, 50, 60 hours of work to do a week, and it doesn\u2019t get done by assuming you can now sleep in on Wednesday because you have no boss waiting for you at the office.", "Of course, there are real changes facing people entering the workforce today and many signs that point to hard times coming for the white-collar worker:", ",", ", and the record number of freelance and temp workers\u2014", "and", ". But the troubling aspect of these changes has little to do with management or design theories, with where and how people do their work, which is what most of", "focuses on. What\u2019s worrisome about the future of work today is the seeming irreversible loss in stability, the increasingly prevalent notion that you can\u2019t depend on a job for more than a few months.", "Saval confronts this uncertain future at the end of the book. Recent changes, Saval argues, suggest that \u201cthe career path that defined the white-collar worker for generations \u2026 is coming to a close, and that a new sort of work, as yet unformed, is taking its place.\u201d It\u2019s a compelling conclusion, but one that the rest of", "hasn\u2019t properly prepared us for. Saval begins the book by acknowledging in a footnote that it will ignore the \u201cwider world of work,\u201d which is precisely what we would need to know about to understand what comes next for the office worker, or to comprehend what the nature of work might look like if offices are in fact on the way out as the most common workplace.", "However, if", "doesn\u2019t serve well as a prophetic text, in its best moments it does offer some insight into what we might be losing. At one point, in one of many pop culture examples used throughout the book, Saval references Tom Rath, the middle-manager protagonist of the 1955 novel", ", who at the end of the book turns down \u201can executive position so that he could work less and spend time with his family (but still earn enough money to maintain a large home in suburban Connecticut).\u201d", "On the one hand, Rath represents a bygone era, where similar middle-management positions provided so many people with a cozy middle-class life. But Rath\u2019s decision is also one that seems foreign to us for reasons beyond the state of the economy or the job market. Many middle-class Americans fail absolutely at creating the kind of boundary between work and life that Rath does in the moment he rejects his promotion. That our lives are defined by work is a common notion in our culture, instilled in us when we\u2019re asked what we want to be when we grow up as kids, confirmed by quizzes in high school social studies that tell us what career we\u2019re most suited for, and set in place by the stresses of choosing a major in university.", "I have a theory that whatever office layout is trendy is what the average kindergarten classroom was when the designers and managers were young kids. Hence tech startups with slides and four desks pushed together like a \"table.\" And naptime.", "", "-Princess Toadstool", "", "", "", "The men and women who dominate Saval\u2019s story are similarly work-obsessed. They are theorists, innovators, and consultants who tackle the problem of the unsatisfied employee in one way: by attempting to make work as comfortable to live in as possible. Yet most of us have probably worked jobs that would never be satisfying, regardless of what perks came with them. As a university student, I spent one summer working at a supermarket. Most of my memories from that job are of interminable shifts and downcast co-workers, with the exception of one department manager\u2014one Tom Rath, you might say\u2014who had spent years at the company but had an upbeat energy distinctly different from anyone else with the same level of seniority. The reason for that became clear when I talked to him about Don DeLillo, about journalism, about things that had nothing to do with putting merchandise on the shelves. Evidently, all these activities outside of work were what actually mattered to him.", "If the job market is set to remain as unpredictable and insecure as we\u2019re watching it become, then putting all our emotional stock in our work life will become increasingly unsatisfying. Of course, none of this is meant to dismiss the grave issue of unemployment and underemployment that\u2019s affecting so many today. But reading", ", and seeing people from 20, 50, and 100 years ago suffering the same workplace woes that we face today, should make us consider trying to change the story we tell: to remove work as the paragon of our day-to-day life.

I thought of \u201c", ",\u201d in which Mr. James Duffy reads in the evening paper about the death of a former lover, a married woman, who was run over by a train, apparently in a state of some inebriation.", "Joyce\u2019s relationship to that other Irish inheritance, Catholicism, was a famously complicated one; he loathed the church\u2019s influence over Irish society, the terrible blunt insistence with which it strangulated the life forces of art and sexuality and intellectual independence. There\u2019s something off about that old priest in \u201cThe Sisters,\u201d about his relationship with the young boy\u2014something stultifying and contaminating. We never really get a sense of the exact nature of that contamination, which makes it all the more insidious, and all the more suggestive of the Catholic church\u2019s immobilizing and corrupting influence on Irish society as a whole. But Joyce was in many important ways a Catholic writer, in the sense that his work\u2014in both its thematic terrain and its philosophical navigations\u2014is inseparable from his Jesuit schooling. As his biographer Ellmann puts it, \u201cThe majesty of the church excited him and never left him.\u201d", "\u201cWe are an unfortunate priest-ridden race and always were and always will be.\u201d", "A century later, Ireland\u2019s vexed relationship with its dominant religion seems a little like Joyce\u2019s. As a country, it mostly feels as though we\u2019ve broken free of the enervating influence of authoritarian Catholicism that perverted Irish culture since the formation of the state. Increased wealth, education, the influence of the European Union, and above all a relentless cascade of revelations about the sexual abuse of children by members of the clergy: All of this has, in recent decades, weakened the church\u2019s grip over what was once more or less a functioning theocracy. Ireland\u2019s church attendance rates have dropped dramatically since the 1990s, and in 2012", "placed Ireland as one of the world\u2019s least religious countries. And yet the structure is still there, underpinning the edifice of public life. In late 2012, when the streets of Dublin were", "against our government\u2019s failure to clearly legislate for abortion in the case of threats to pregnant women\u2019s lives, I found myself thinking often of James Joyce, and the things he wrote about this country. This public rage had been caused by the death of Savita Halappanavar, an Indian woman who had died in a hospital in Galway\u2014a hospital which was, like most of our public hospitals, explicitly Catholic in its ethos. Even though she was miscarrying, and even though she and her husband repeatedly asked that she be given an abortion, she was turned down because, as a midwife explained to them, \u201cThis is a Catholic country.\u201d This phrase, in its blank and terrible irony, seemed to haunt Ireland for a long time, and even now I can\u2019t hear it without thinking of Simon Dedalus\u2019 dire pronouncement in A Portrait that \u201cWe are an unfortunate priest-ridden race and always were and always will be till the end of the chapter.\u201d As modern and liberal a place as Ireland mostly feels, there are moments when the deadly work of the old paralysis can still be seen, and when the reflection of Joyce\u2019s nicely-polished looking glass still retains a portion of its grim accuracy.", "* * *", "Photo courtesy of the Office of the Lord Mayor of Dublin", "I have said that it is maddening at times, how deeply Joyce\u2019s image is imprinted on Dublin, but it\u2019s hard to imagine the place without his presence. It\u2019s most unavoidable, of course, on June 16 every year. On this day, Bloomsday, the city lays on a varied program of events and happenings and readings and walking tours; if on any other day of the year you might manage to ignore Joyce, on this day he is nonnegotiable. You see women in voluminous Edwardian dress, middle-aged men in ill-fitting white seersucker and straw boat hats, clusters of gussied-up", "enthusiasts standing around nibbling Gorgonzola sandwiches in tribute to the gustatory preferences of Mr. Leopold Bloom. All over the city, in locations that feature in the novel\u2014the National Library, Sandymount Strand, Glasnevin Cemetery, all largely unchanged since Joyce\u2019s time\u2014people read the passages that pertain to those places. The whole merry rigmarole happens on this date because Joyce set his book not just on \u201ca summer\u2019s day,\u201d but on this particular one. And he did so in order to commemorate his first date with Nora, rescheduled from June 14, the evening they walked together to Ringsend and, as he made a point of reminding her in one of his letters, \u201cyou slid your hand down inside my trousers and pulled my shirt softly aside and touched my prick with your long tickling fingers and gradually took it all, fat and stiff as it was, into your hand and frigged me slowly until I came off through your fingers, all the time bending over me and gazing at me out of your quiet saintlike eyes.\u201d", "And so it is that every June 16, the city of Dublin, the capital of the unfortunate priest-ridden state that refused to repatriate Joyce\u2019s profane body after his death, commemorates with all the convivial pomp of a religious festival or a historical reconstruction the occasion of the furtive outdoor handjob he later referred to as a sacrament. This can only really be seen as a measure of the wicked genius of James Joyce, whom the chorus girls of Zurich would later come to know as \u201cHerr Satan.\u201d", "And I can\u2019t tell you how weird it is to me, how beautiful in a way, that the city I live in\u2014that I, like most Dubliners, love and deplore, and that I can\u2019t stop thinking about and don\u2019t know how to write about\u2014has an annual festival that, whether it wants to admit it or not, marks the occasion of a specific ejaculation. Because it seems to me to encapsulate with a sort of dreamlike accuracy the nature of the relationship between this city and its most famously wayward son, which was one of frustrated love. Part of his great and endless gift to his home was the creative act of sinning against it, of transgressing against the narrowness and piety of its poor stunted houses. He showed Dublin to itself and to the world, but he also made it what it is: for better or worse, Joyce\u2019s city.", "---", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

One of his more impressive gifts is the ability to create a sense of momentum within essentially static narratives; the way in which nothing happens, in his work, can often have the aura of spectacle. And this has everything to do with the charisma of his voice, with the leisurely sharpness of his prose.

The machinery of plot is vanishingly minimal here (private detective/good-looking dame/missing husband), but it\u2019s sufficient to drive the narrative, such as it is. Dyer\u2019s protagonist, the functionally named Walker, tracks Malory (missing husband) through a lengthy succession of imaginary and increasingly strange locations. Malory is a classic MacGuffin; in fact, the entire narrative is a MacGuffin, a pretext for describing a Calvinoesque series of strange imaginary locations.", "There\u2019s a town that\u2019s all one gigantic building, where the streets are corridors and the houses are rooms. There\u2019s a town where everyone is frozen in midgesture, like a vast three-dimensional photograph.

For one thing, the book is as concentratedly funny as anything he\u2019s written. The situation provides plenty of occasion to exercise the comic persona he\u2019s been consolidating for most of his career. There\u2019s a wonderful diversion in the opening pages, where Dyer point-blank refuses to accept the suboptimal sleeping arrangements on this supercarrier with a crew of well over 5,000. Not getting his own room is entirely out of the question, as far as he\u2019s concerned: \u201cBut we writers need a room of one\u2019s own, I claimed, trusting that any grammatical damage would be more than offset\u2014in the eyes of the Navy\u2014by the Virginia Woolf allusion.\u201d This tenacity pays off, and he gets his room of one\u2019s own. \u201cI had taken on the might of the US Navy and won,\u201d he gloats. The room itself is, as he puts it, \u201cpractically the honeymoon suite, a place where a man could devote himself single-handed to the maritime art of masturbation.\u201d", "Dyer is nothing like a proper journalist. He keeps forgetting and mixing up people\u2019s names, for example.", "Thankfully, Dyer doesn\u2019t go down this route, possibly because he\u2019s saving that subject for a whole other project\u2014perhaps a sequel to his", ". Instead, he spends the majority of the book being escorted around the vast carrier, talking to people about their various roles and their lives at sea. This might make it sound like a conventional work of journalism or reportage, but Dyer frequently makes it obvious that he\u2019s nothing like a proper journalist. He keeps forgetting and mixing up people\u2019s names, for example, and is not immune to getting bored with what they\u2019re telling him and losing the thread of interviews. It isn\u2019t these lapses per se that separate him from your typical journalist, so much as his willingness to admit to them, to make of them his own peculiar literary virtue. Dyer has always been doggedly committed to making a virtue of his own weaknesses. As he put it in a short piece in the", "last year, \u201cA writer\u2019s only possible relation to his or her failings has to be one of gratitude. First because there are hundreds of other writers out there whose strengths lie precisely in these areas of weakness. Second because these weaknesses oblige us to concentrate on the one or two little areas that are uniquely\u2014and, as far as every other writer is concerned, undesirably\u2014our own.\u201d", "Photo by Jason Oddy", "Many of the book\u2019s best moments\u2014and it is full of great moments\u2014are generated not by Dyer\u2019s attempts to honor his basic journalistic obligations, but by his hanging back and noticing the things that a typical reporter would likely deem irrelevant. He\u2019s at his most interesting here, as he always is, when he\u2019s insisting on the importance of trivialities. Here he is, for instance, watching members of the ground crew hanging about on deck during a quiet moment between launches: \u201cJohn Updike asks, in one of his books about art, if there is such a thing as an American face. I don\u2019t know, but looking at the guys on the flight deck, unfaced by cranials and vizors, persuaded me that there is such a thing as an American walk. Even overweight cops have it: an ease and grace, a subdued swagger. It used to be identified mainly with race\u2014a black thing\u2014but now it seems a cultural and national quality.\u201d A good writer, like a good standup comic, makes a point of mentioning things you yourself are likely to have noticed, but which you, unlike that writer or comic, are unlikely to have noticed yourself noticing. And like a good standup comic, Dyer is consistently alert to the comic potency of rhythmical accumulation. He is irrefutably one of contemporary literature\u2019s finest purveyors of face-melting riffs. Here, for instance, he takes his cue from a phrase used by the sailor from Florida who gives him a tour around one of the ship\u2019s many stores of explosives:", "Dyer\u2019s method of writing around rather than about his subject is typically one of his great strengths, but there are moments in", "when you wonder whether he should be doing more than nodding in the direction of the vast looming context of his immediate situation. About a third of the way through the book, I began to feel uneasy about his refusal to engage the military power of which this gigantic ship is both symbol and vessel\u2014his apparent lack of interest in the question of what this aircraft carrier is doing off the coast of Bahrain in the first place, what this booming industry of launching and landing is ultimately in service of. As brilliantly as he writes about the things he is interested in, and as worthy of consideration as he proves them to be, the largely unacknowledged presence of that context exerts a cumulative pressure on the book.

Equipped with the very kinds of books that I listed at the outset of this review (including Gilbert\u2019s), Woolsey took weeks to read the novel at home before the trial began, and struggled with its challenging syntax while arriving at a grudging respect for Joyce\u2019s accomplishment. Referring to the famous final section of the novel, told in the interior voice of Leopold Bloom\u2019s unfaithful wife, Molly, Woolsey acknowledged, \u201cit may represent the moods of a woman of that sort.

{"Body": ["Illustration by Eleanor Davis", "What conditions are necessary for women to produce great literary work? Virginia Woolf \u2019s answer in", "was, to begin with, down-to-earth, practical, material. Women need an income and time and space to themselves in order to write\u2014metaphorically, 500 pounds a year income and rooms of their own. When Woolf was writing, in 1927, married women had only had the right to own property since the year of her birth. So women, as a class, were poor, and Woolf believed that their poverty affected their creative power in subtle as well as obvious ways. For one thing, they were not educated as well as men. If they were lucky, they might attend the women\u2019s college at Oxford or one of the two women\u2019s colleges at Cambridge that existed at that time. But even there they would see, from the austerity of their own surroundings and the splendor of the men\u2019s colleges, what relative value their society put on their minds and the minds of their brothers. This, in turn, would affect their self-confidence, and more than anything else except talent, self-confidence is what an artist requires, a belief that what you have to say, or the vision of the world that you feel it in yourself to convey, is important.", "Here the argument shifts from the economic to the psychological underpinnings of creativity. The sense of self and entitlement to speak were very tenuous in Virginia Woolf herself, and of course she was writing autobiographically. Although her father was a learned man and something of a philosopher, he was a classic Victorian patriarch who did not believe that his daughters should be educated. Their brother went to Cambridge, but Vanessa and Virginia Stephen were made to stay at home and run their father\u2019s household, until he died and they were freed to live their own lives. Virginia never quite recovered from the unfairness of her domestic servitude, the sacrifice of her potential, as she saw it, to that of the male side of her family, and this psychic wound was the source of a sustaining combativeness, just as Dickens\u2019 childhood trauma of being made to work in a blacking factory instead of going to school shaped his life in its sympathies and resentments.", "In an unforgettable section of", ", Woolf imagines a sister for Shakespeare, an equally gifted sister, named Judith. Will is sent to school. Judith stays at home and is uneducated. He becomes a playwright in London. She, Cinderella-like, becomes the household servant. When her father produces a husband for her, she runs away to London to be a playwright like her brother, or an actress. But she is laughed at: Women can\u2019t write; women can\u2019t act. A playwright named Nick Greene takes pity on her, which means he sleeps with her and gets her pregnant. In despair, Shakespeare\u2019s sister ends her own life. What presents itself in some part as melodramatic spoof is an autobiographical, compensating fantasy: Why am I, Virginia, not as great as Shakespeare? Because I have been hounded, confounded, and driven to stifle my own talent. I am not Shakespeare because I\u2019m his sister.", "If I were writing an update of", "today, I would try to create a character to match Shakespeare\u2019s sister. I would create a more entitled woman, someone with even more advantages than Virginia Woolf could imagine when she was writing in 1927. I would call her Prospero\u2019s Daughter.", "My Prospero\u2019s Daughter lives in England\u2014for me, an imaginary kingdom where everyone is articulate and witty, where women can have titles, where literature is the national sport. Exiled to this island by evil usurpers in his native land, Prospero brought with him his family traditions of respect for knowledge, love of art and music, and philosophical skepticism. He was a powerful wizard with the great gift of being able to explain his wizardry on television. He and his wife had four daughters. Miranda was the oldest. With no boys in the family, Prospero treated her as though she were his son. From the time she could talk, he took her education in hand. He started playing chess with her when she was 4 years old. A gifted mathematician, Miranda was treated as special, her father\u2019s heir, until she went to the university. This was the early 1960s, and for the first time she encountered remnants of the world Virginia Woolf had written about, including women instructors who had been trained to believe in their own inferiority. Miranda studied math with a woman who told her she would try to have her reassigned to a man because women weren\u2019t as good at math as men. Horrified, Miranda ran to a pay phone and called her father. \u201cIs it true,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat women can\u2019t do math?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rubbish,\u201d he said. But the damage had been done. Her relationship to math now became tentative. She moved into another field, history. The years of her education passed, and she started to teach and write. She wrote an original work and got an excellent teaching position. She fell in love with another historian and they married, but competing at the same job was hard, and they divorced. She raised their child alone, married again, and had two more children.", "Now, although life was pleasant, it got very hard for her. She was teaching and writing. She was bringing up three children. When they were babies and toddlers, she was always exhausted. She had to get up in the night when they did. She didn\u2019t get enough sleep but still had to go to work the next day. Yes, she had child care, but it was always failing for one reason or another. Yes, she had help in the house, but it was never enough, and also, the help needed supervision and instruction. The children got sick. New arrangements had to be made. And always, there was laundry to be done, food to buy, food to cook, a messy household to live in, pathetic efforts to tidy up, classes to prepare, meetings to attend, newspapers and magazines to keep up with. Then the demands of the children became less physical: There wasn\u2019t diapering or so much laundry, but there were lessons to take the children to, performances at school to attend, teachers to talk to, doctors to be seen, and, as always, food to be bought and prepared, clothes to be shopped for. Most important, there were the relationships with the children, listening to them, answering them, directing, reassuring, and understanding them, containing one\u2019s anger at them sometimes, advising, encouraging, and guiding them\u2014in short, bringing them up, hoping and trying at the same time to keep a living relationship with her husband.", "Twenty-five years go by, endless and laden as they are being lived but seeming like a moment in retrospect. The children are gone. Now Miranda finds herself with lots of time, and she knows how to use it, accustomed as she is to squeezing the most out of every minute. She sets to work and writes brilliant books that no one but she could produce. She is seventy, but still in full swing. Her marriage is good. Her children are thriving. She is Dame Miranda. The only discrimination she has encountered in her life has been because of her gender, but she has lived a full life despite it. Her biggest problem has been balancing the demands of family and work. But this, although she doesn\u2019t complain about it\u2014she would never have given up the joy of having children, the satisfaction of family life\u2014is a big problem, the problem that a new version of", "would address. The main burden of family life still falls on women. Prospero\u2019s Daughter solved the problem by superhuman energy and by readjusting the life cycle, putting some of her creative work toward the end rather than the middle of her life, using productively the later years we often think of as leftovers. If you look at her life from the outside, you would say she was privileged, but she doesn\u2019t feel privileged. She feels overworked\u2014until suddenly she has acres of time. It\u2019s far from being the gross servitude of Shakespeare\u2019s sister, but the burden of family is now the central issue of women and creativity, whether the creativity is expressed in novels or interior design schemes, litigation or business plans, cupcakes or algorithms.", "Motherhood and their personal lives affect the professional lives of women who are writers as much as they do the professional lives of women who are bankers or lawyers, and it goes beyond balancing the time demands of family and career. Such women as Jodi Picoult may write novels that flow naturally from family life, and they may be very successful in some ways but wish for more respect. Another writer, Grace Paley, might feel the claims of family and community so strongly that she writes much less than her fans would want her to. Another Daughter of Prospero might foreswear children, find a nurturing husband, and write prolifically. Joyce Carol Oates took that path. Toni Morrison had race to contend with as well as gender as a factor in keeping her from getting the respect she deserved. It took a public demonstration on her behalf and a protest against her failure to be given prizes before the prizes were prised loose and started to come to her as regularly as she deserved.", "One common way of suppressing respect for women writers is to accuse them of privilege. What should we call this? False populism? Bait-and-switch class warfare? Women, who might well be considered a class in themselves, are attacked for belonging to the middle class\u2014or, even worse, the upper class\u2014by male critics who are themselves usually middle class but speak as though they were working a 12-hour shift in a steel mill. The woman writer enjoys a privilege which offends them. Her focus on family and relationships seems trivial. Her way of getting at truth seems indirect and banal. Her feel for the specific detail verges on an obsession with brands.", "provides a good example. Her wealth is off-putting to him. It constitutes a problem in sympathy. \u201cNo major American novelist has led a more privileged life than Wharton did. Although she was seldom free of money worries, she always lived as if she were.\u201d Like a husband whose wife doesn\u2019t appreciate how hard he works to make a living for her, Franzen frets that Wharton lived", "she had no money worries, although she did have them. \u201cPrivilege like hers isn\u2019t easy to like; it puts her at a moral disadvantage.\u201d Privilege, however, is in the eyes of the beholder. Many of us see a male writer like Hemingway as privileged, in his freedom to live as he chooses, to experience what he wants, to fish, to fuck, to fight, to write, whatever, while Hadley or Pauline or Martha or Mary takes care of getting dinner on the table, the laundry done, and the children put to bed. So far as I know, no one has ever raised the issue of privilege as an obstacle to appreciating Hemingway, Henry James, John Cheever, or Gore Vidal. Privilege was exactly the issue Virginia Woolf was getting at in", "and later", "\u2014male privilege.", "Respect may come. We will become more accustomed to authority in women and the forms it takes\u2014greatness not being incompatible, for example, with wanting to have one\u2019s hair done twice a week. I can imagine a culture in which self-deprecating men make tiny distinctions while women make connections between matters large and small and ponder the big questions that affect societies, even if they address these issues in a style incompatible with older ideas of dignity and seriousness. The one thing I suspect will not change is that men are not likely to start reading women\u2019s books. Fortunately, this is a matter for the unacknowledged legislators and not for the elected ones.", "Reading is almost always subversive. From the time you read the next night\u2019s fairy tale under the covers by flashlight when you have already had your bedtime story from Daddy and are supposed to be asleep to the time you are an adult reading junk, hoping no one catches you at it, reading is private; that\u2019s the most seductive thing about it. It\u2019s you and the book. Women\u2019s reading will respond to women\u2019s needs. Men\u2019s will respond to men\u2019s.

Neal is the stay-at-home dad to her working mom, and for as long as they\u2019ve been together Georgie has felt guilty over his unhappiness with her ambitions and their life in L.A. But unlike Neal, Georgie has known what she wanted since college, and while part of what she\u2019s always wanted has been him, the other part is her career.

Still, we adults keenly remember that feeling of being powerless teenagers (or we should), and as much as we grow up, we often still feel the vestiges of it; we, too, can feel trapped as our lives unfold in ways we wouldn\u2019t have planned.

We don\u2019t ever reach a point where we check the box: Life: figured out now! Marriage: happy! Done! Whether in adult or YA fiction, Rowell doesn\u2019t shrink from the big, life-long questions: What do we want? Who do we love and why? What does it mean to be a satisfied human? How can we try? These aren\u2019t questions confined to one category or another, any more than they\u2019re confined to a particular age group.

What matters most are the middles, which she packs with thoughtful dissections of how we live today, reflections upon the many ways in which we can love and connect as humans, and tacit reassurances of the validity of our feelings regardless of our particular experiences. While affirming, the books are also challenging, because most of all they present an argument for an examined life. Nothing is assumed. Everything is considered. And readers are encouraged, in reading, to do the same for themselves.

You\u2019ll feel Joyce\u2019s influence, certainly, as well as that of Samuel Beckett (and what Irish writer could really avoid these two?), and yet McBride\u2019s novel feels weirdly outside of literature, despite having been hustled to the forefront of it, racking up a number of prizes in Europe.

There are few commas (normal or inverted) and many, many full stops.

And many of the ungrammatical, almost prelinguistic sentence fragments\u2014\u201cMy thud cheeks up,\u201d for example\u2014are instantly understood. It\u2019s a lesson in just how far the rules of the English language can be bent before comprehension falls away, as though McBride had discovered a pidgin of the reptilian brain. There are moments where she compromises this oblique style somewhat, throwing her reader a bone, whether in long passages of dialogue or at the beginning of chapters where it\u2019s necessary to establish a scene: \u201cWe\u2019re living in the country cold and wet with slugs going across the carpet every night.

Half-formed, the girl uses abjection to separate herself\u2014herself and her brother both\u2014from all these things. For her, abjection takes the familiar form of sexual promiscuity, beginning at 13 in an encounter with her uncle and developing through many partners into a blooming masochistic need. There is a great deal of ambiguity here\u2014in the girl\u2019s conflicted response to the initial incest-rape, in the moments of pleasure experienced between pain and fear, and in the way guilt over her actual or perceived complicity acts both as relief and an inducement to continue. In these guilty moments, scraps and passages of liturgy force their way into the text as through the narrator\u2019s conscience, their phlegmatic Catholic weight providing, like all those full stops, both anchorage and (narrative, rhythmic, emotional) impedance. Before having sex with her uncle, she wades into the lake, a kind of baptism\u2014the first of many\u2014in which she humiliates herself before God prior to the more visible, literal abasement.

Sin allows her body, her self, to be real, and there is a kind of beauty in this, along with a host of contradictory emotions.

What now? Calm sliding down into my boat and pushing out to sin.\u201d Sin, like love, is freedom for her but also a form of revenge which keeps her from being free.

The thing.\u201d In her affectless, distant narration, the girl finds existence in alienation. So: A woman invites violence to be done to her, is (joyfully) made a thing of, and becomes a subject again through, of all things, a kind of guilt bound up in love. This form of redemption, if that is what it is, can be wearying.", "And yet, attempts to reduce", "to such simple, programmatic readings will be frustrated by the way events are narrated: The immediacy of the prose sets it outside of symbolism, and so sexual violence\u2014in particular a gut-wrenching and, in its typographic transgressions, almost onomatopoetic scene towards the end\u2014is not allowed to stand for much, isn\u2019t recuperated by message or theme. It\u2019s not so much sublimated by art as purified of it. The brother, too, easily a Christ-like innocent, dying for his sister\u2019s sins, isn\u2019t that, and so death is given the full and awful weight with which it presents.

Amis handles the switches of register with suave composure. It\u2019s Thomsen who occupies the stylistic high ground, delivering his portion of the book with delicate Nabokovian relish and self-regard. He describes his own body, for instance, at impressive length, from the \u201cFlemish chute of the nose, the disdainful pleat of the mouth,\u201d to the \u201cextensile penis, classically compact in repose (with pronounced prepuce).\u201d Thomsen seems occasionally troubled by the nature of his work as a middle-manager in a bureaucracy of slaughter, describing himself at one point as a Schreibtischtater\u2014\u201ca", "\u201d;\u00a0 specifically, he oversees the Auschwitz-based project, run by the chemical giant IG Farben and manned by Jewish slave labor, to develop synthetic fuel and rubber for the war effort.", "For much of the book, though, Thomsen is largely preoccupied with trying to get the Kommandant\u2019s wife into the sack. Being the nephew of Hitler\u2019s personal secretary gives him a certain license in this arena, a certain leeway for insubordination, though even in the engine-room of the Holocaust, social norms continue to obtain. The notion of sexual misdemeanor seems unspeakably trivial in the context of the book\u2019s setting, an absurdity of which Thomsen seems grimly aware. Early in the book, during a moment alone with Hannah at the entrance to a greenhouse, he wonders whether it would be \u201cso strange, really, to urge her on inside and to lean into her and gather in my dropped hands the white folds of her dress? Would it? Here? Where everything was allowed?\u201d", "Of the three first-person narrators, only Thomsen is given unrestricted access to the lavish treasury of Amis\u2019 prose. Szmul\u2019s sections are unremittingly bleak and harrowingly effective\u2014and notably short, as though he were running out of things to say about the theater of horrors in which he has been forced to act as stage manager. \u201cNearly all our work,\u201d he writes, \u201cis done among the dead, with the heavy scissors, the pliers and the mallets, the buckets of petrol refuse, the ladles, the grinders.\u201d Doll\u2019s narration, though, is curtailed by other means: the dull constraints of his intellect and his imagination. With Doll, Amis is straining his sentences through a filter of clich\u00e9. We first encounter him after a stressful incident involving the processing of a trainload of new arrivals, which he informs us has left him with \u201ca splitting headache.\u201d We\u2019re getting the full linguistic dramatization of the banality of evil here, in other words\u2014an idea which has, of course, long been a standard in the repertoire of Nazi platitudes. Doll\u2019s eyes are resolutely averted from his own depravity, and from the unprecedented horror of the \u201cProjekt\u201d he is overseeing. Of the work that Szmul and the other Sonderkommandos do on his behalf\u2014the relocation and rendering and disposal of corpses, or \u201cSt\u00fccke\u201d (pieces)\u2014he has this to say: \u201cYou know, I never cease to marvel at the abyss of moral destitution to which certain human beings are willing to descend.\u201d", "This blindness is the most compelling thing about Doll, the blank center of his corruption. He\u2019s a vivid creation, a metastasized joke of a character who is both one of history\u2019s most prolific mass murderers and a basically incompetent bureaucrat, known to his colleagues as \u201cthe old boozer.\u201d Amis effectively evokes Doll\u2019s inability to apprehend the horror of himself. At one point, disgusted by the smell of death emanating from the camp\u2014from the chimneys, the smoke, the bodies\u2014he feels \u201cas if I were in one of those cloacal dreams that all of us have from time to time\u2014you know, where you seem to turn into a frothing geyser of hot filth, like a stupendous oil strike, and it just keeps on coming and coming and piling up everywhere no matter what you try and do.\u201d It\u2019s not the imagery that is most unsettling here, but Doll\u2019s matter-of-fact assertion\u2014his ability to convince himself\u2014that this is normal, that this is a dream \u201call of us\u201d have.", "But Doll\u2019s blindness is also a character flaw in another, more technical, sense: Amis tends to overdramatize it, and so, as a character in a novel, he\u2019s pretty flawed. Amis is temperamentally a satirist, of course, and so his tendency is to overdramatize pretty much everything. His most memorable characters are sophisticated studies of brute grotesquery: Think of Keith Talent in", "; think of John Self in", "; think, for that matter, of the character named \u201cMartin Amis\u201d who has been the protagonist of a long-running episodic farce in the newspapers of the English-speaking world for the past 30 years.", "Photo by Michael Lionstar", "Doll\u2019s animating principle as a character is that of dramatic irony: We are constantly being made aware of the extent to which we know more than he does about himself, of his utter incapacity to see himself for what he is. At one point, he announces \u201cI\u2019ve come to believe that it was all a tragic mistake.\u201d He\u2019s talking not about the Holocaust, but about his marriage: \u201cI turn things over in my mind and, yes, I\u2019ve come to believe that it was all a tragic mistake\u2014marrying such a large woman.\u201d (Because he can\u2019t beat her up, you see: \u201cShe\u2019s too fucking big.\u201d)", "The irony here is too clearly superintended by an authorial hand, and so Doll stops seeming like a complex and self-determined individual and starts to look like very much like an inanimate object of editorial intent. And Amis keeps doing this throughout, keeps making him say things obviously intended for the purposes of his mockery. At one point, he quotes approvingly a passage from", "on how \u201cMarxism itself systematically plans to hand the world over to the Jews\u201d, and then insists that \u201cWell, you can\u2019t argue with logic of that calibre. No:", ". Next question, please.\u201d There\u2019s a strange collapse of the distinction between the voice of an intellectually coarse and heedless character and the editorial voice of his author; Doll\u2019s approval, in other words, sounds as though it\u2019s being pitched in the kind of ironic register we know to be beyond his range. (Amis\u2019 last novel, the muddled but often very funny", ", was similarly marred by a cumulatively antagonizing insistence on reminding the reader that Lionel speaks with a heavy working-class London accent\u2014on specifying that \u201cpaddock\u201d is delivered \u201cwith the full plosive on the terminal", ".\u201d)", "These aren\u2019t trivial lapses, but they\u2019re not structural deficiencies either; I found myself mostly willing to overlook them, to see them as manifestations of Amis\u2019 internalized dispute with the conventions of realism. It\u2019s hard to think of a writer more relentlessly vivid and precise in his evocations of the world, and less bothered about the creation of psychologically convincing characters. One of the perennial criticisms of his work is that his immense comic and stylistic talents are ill-served by his pursuit of profoundly serious subject matters, that he keeps overreaching his range by going after these great and terrible historical themes. There is truth to this, of course: Amis has never written anything as good as", ", his brutal comic evisceration of the demented acquisitiveness of the 1980s. (But then who has? Seriously, I would like to know: Who has?)", "What this criticism fails to take into account, though, is the extent to which his Dickensian flair, his fixation on the most violent and debased aspects of humanity, find a commensurate subject in the darkest abominations of the last century. Paul Doll is a kind of nightmare version of Lionel Asbo, or", "\u2019 Keith Talent\u2014a small and vicious man, made large in this instance by history\u2019s terrible accommodation of his grotesquerie.", "\"Should the Holocaust Be Off Limits to a Comic Writer Like Martin Amis?\" Seriously?

But we do get one glimpse of him, when Bormann asks his nephew, Thomsen, whether he\u2019s ever seen the F\u00fchrer up close. Thomsen says that he was in the same room as him just once, at Bormann\u2019s own wedding in 1929. He looked, Thomsen recalls, \u201cso much like a pale, pouchy, and cruelly overworked head waiter that every civilian there, I felt, was trying very hard not to hand him a tip.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty solid zinger; if I had a time machine, I\u2019d be happy to travel back to the \u201930s and read it aloud to Hitler himself.", "But this turns out to be a much more volatile irony, and a more resonant one, than any of Amis\u2019 more controlled and controlling satirical interventions. Because it doesn\u2019t so much cut Hitler down to size\u2014what would be the point of that?\u2014as deepen the enigma of how such a drab and mean character could ever have razed Europe to the ground, could have acquired such catastrophic power in the first place.

The alley where they cornered him after staking out his apartment to see if Rice spent the night is ground zero. The press no longer covered issues but became more interested in tabloid pursuits. Individual reporters wanted to become the next Woodward or Bernstein. They justified the whole business by claiming they were looking into \u201ccharacter,\u201d an arrogant pursuit that put the press in the role of scold and moral judge.

In 1984, Mondale had used vague character claims in his race against Hart in the\u00a0 presidential race, and in 1987, the issue of honesty was on the table again, as voters wondered whether Reagan had lied about the arms-for-hostages swap that became known as the Iran Contra affair.", "Voters couldn\u2019t just take a politician\u2019s word for it or pore over his white papers.

Eagleton lashed out at the press, as Hart would later do. But ultimately he resigned. In Hart\u2019s view, the episode destroyed McGovern\u2019s chance at the presidency.

But those were the blunt rules of the politics of the personal.", "Campaigns have always narrowed complex people down to little moments. That happens, in part, because\u00a0voters key in on the kind of personal details that are the most immediately familiar to them.\u00a0In retrospect, some of the critical turning points in campaigns seem ridiculous. Was Muskie really hurt in New Hampshire because he seemed to cry? Did Nixon really save his reputation in 1952 by talking about his wife\u2019s cloth coat? Did Ford really lose the Texas primary to Reagan because he ate a tamale with the husk still on? Carter admitted that he \u201clusted in his heart\u201d in 1976, but that couldn\u2019t possibly have been important to anyone.", "The chance for a personal trait to define a candidate beyond all reason was well in place before Hart\u2019s troubles.\u00a0Indeed, the lingering fallout from Ted Kennedy\u2019s 1969 car accident at Chappaquiddick, which killed his date Mary Jo Kopechne, was one of the reasons Kennedy did not run\u2014and that Hart was thus a frontrunner\u2014in 1987.", "What changed in Hart\u2019s case was that the hunt into the personal started to include investigations into sexual indiscretions\u2014and that such hunts now included staking out the candidate in his apartment. Wilbur Mills\u2019 affair with a stripper had ended his career in 1974, but that was because a drunken Mills had crashed his car into the Tidal Basin, not because the press had set up a sobriety test.", "Still, in the Hart episode, reporters went a little further down a well-worn road\u2014they didn\u2019t blaze a new trail. And how exactly the press went as far as it did is complex in other ways. Hart famously said, \u201cFollow me around. I don\u2019t care. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They\u2019d be very bored.\u201d As Bai notes, that quote came out at the same time as the", "story about Rice, so no journalist could claim they were simply taking up the candidate on his challenge. Still, Hart had been telling reporters on and off the record for months that there was nothing to sordid claims about his past. When there was suddenly evidence he was fooling around in real time, it\u2019s likely that reporters felt duped and let him have it in extra measure as retribution for trying to hoodwink them.", "It\u2019s possible, then, that the media\u2019s failure in the Hart matter was like Hart\u2019s admitted adultery: a regrettable episode of excess for which some context is required before making a sweeping judgment\u2014especially since, unlike Hart, the press was motivated at least in some fashion by a sense of duty.

But, in part because the press realized that it had gone too far in the Hart and Clinton years, plenty of stories in the years since that should have had tabloid appeal didn\u2019t cause feeding frenzies.\u00a0The rethinking started almost immediately.

The mutations\u2014the rise of 24-hour cable news, social media, and hyper-partisanship\u2014weren\u2019t really a factor in Hart\u2019s case. Cable news, which really blossomed after Hart, thrives by keeping viewers on the boil, arguing over the latest controversy or buzzy development. There\u2019s plenty to cover because partisans are in a state of perpetual outrage whether there is good reason to be or not. The fight is the thing and everything is a fight. Unlike in \u201987, there\u2019s not even a flawed journalistic precept to justify a lot of current coverage\u2014anything related to Donald Trump, for example.

It\u2019s been that way by increasing degrees since it became accepted for candidates to campaign for themselves. That was a century ago. H.L.

He died three decades before anyone had heard of Donna Rice.", "Presidential campaigns have always been as much or more about who a candidate is than what they say, but it\u2019s a tricky thing to evaluate a presidential candidate, because successful presidential characteristics always have a negative side lingering nearby. Self-confidence can become hubris, focus can become insularity. Almost all great presidents were complex and contained traits that would disqualify them in today\u2019s frantic world. Lincoln had severe bouts of crippling depression. FDR lied often and was a needy adulterer. George Washington could be an unhinged", ". Oh, and Richard Nixon had a clean private life. Bai\u2019s important call for perspective is a reminder to all of us in the press and the electorate to recognize the complexity of the human condition, whether we\u2019re casting aside candidates because they wear a funny helmet in a tank or because they once committed adultery.

But gratifyingly, she\u2019s not hung up on constantly reminding you of that. While the book\u2019s dutiful bibliography, endnotes, and index collectively swallow up fully one-third of its 450 pages, Lepore emphatically positions herself between the reader and the long, tedious hours she\u2019s clocked in dingy vaults and sub-basements: She\u2019s done the work so we don\u2019t have to.", "Again and again, she distills the figures she writes about into clean, simple, muscular prose, making unequivocal assertions that carry a faint electric charge.

Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled upon all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the night.", "\u201cI expect you\u2019ll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed,\u201d said Herbert, as he bade them good-night, \u201cand something horrible squatting up on top of the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains.\u201d", "He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last face was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey\u2019s paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.", "In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shrivelled little paw was pitched on the sideboard with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.", "\u201cI suppose all old soldiers are the same,\u201d said Mrs. White. \u201cThe idea of our listening to such nonsense!

All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman\u2019s knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired sergeant-majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor\u2019s bill.", "\u201cHerbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home,\u201d she said, as they sat at dinner.", "\u201cI dare say,\u201d said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; \u201cbut for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I\u2019ll swear to.\u201d", "\u201cYou thought it did,\u201d said the old lady soothingly.", "\u201cI say it did,\u201d replied the other. \u201cThere was no thought about it; I had just\u2014- What\u2019s the matter?\u201d", "His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connection with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs. White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.", "She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband\u2019s coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden.

What is it? What is it?\u201d", "Her husband interposed. \u201cThere, there, mother,\u201d he said, hastily. \u201cSit down, and don\u2019t jump to conclusions.

Thank\u2014\u201d", "She broke off suddenly as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned upon her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other\u2019s averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling old hand upon his. There was a long silence.", "\u201cHe was caught in the machinery,\u201d said the visitor at length in a low voice.", "\u201cCaught in the machinery,\u201d repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion, \u201cyes.\u201d", "He sat staring blankly out at the window, and taking his wife\u2019s hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting-days nearly forty years before.", "\u201cHe was the only one left to us,\u201d he said, turning gently to the visitor. \u201cIt is hard.\u201d", "The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. \u201cThe firm wished me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,\u201d he said, without looking round. \u201cI beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders.\u201d", "There was no reply; the old woman\u2019s face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband\u2019s face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action.", "\u201cI was to say that \u2018Maw and Meggins\u2019 disclaim all responsibility,\u201d continued the other. \u201cThey admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son\u2019s services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation.\u201d", "Mr. White dropped his wife\u2019s hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor.

It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen \u2014something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.", "But the days passed, and expectation gave place to resignation\u2014the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes miscalled, apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.", "It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.", "\u201cCome back,\u201d he said, tenderly. \u201cYou will be cold.\u201d", "\u201cIt is colder for my son,\u201d said the old woman, and wept afresh.", "The sound of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.", "\u201cThe paw!\u201d she cried wildly. \u201cThe monkey\u2019s paw!\u201d", "He started up in alarm. \u201cWhere? Where is it?

Why didn\u2019t you think of it?\u201d", "\u201cThink of what?\u201d he questioned.", "\u201cThe other two wishes,\u201d she replied, rapidly. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had one.\u201d", "\u201cWas not that enough?\u201d he demanded, fiercely.", "\u201cNo,\u201d she cried, triumphantly; \u201cwe\u2019ll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.\u201d", "The man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs. \u201cGood God, you are mad!\u201d he cried, aghast.", "\u201cGet it,\u201d she panted; \u201cget it quickly, and wish\u2014Oh, my boy, my boy!\u201d", "Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. \u201cGet back to bed,\u201d he said, unsteadily. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are saying.\u201d", "\u201cWe had the first wish granted,\u201d said the old woman, feverishly; \u201cwhy not the second?\u201d", "\u201cA coincidence,\u201d stammered the old man.", "\u201cGo and get it and wish,\u201d cried his wife, quivering with excitement.", "The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. \u201cHe has been dead ten days, and besides he\u2014I would not tell you else, but\u2014I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?\u201d", "\u201cBring him back,\u201d cried the old woman, and dragged him toward the door. \u201cDo you think I fear the child I have nursed?\u201d", "He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantelpiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.", "Even his wife\u2019s face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.", "\u201cWish!\u201d she cried, in a strong voice.", "\u201cIt is foolish and wicked,\u201d he faltered.", "\u201cWish!\u201d repeated his wife.", "He raised his hand. \u201cI wish my son alive again.\u201d", "The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.", "He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until, with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a minute or two afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.", "Neither spoke, but lay silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.", "At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.", "The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d cried the old woman, starting up.", "\u201cA rat,\u201d said the old man in shaking tones\u2014\u201da rat. It passed me on the stairs.\u201d", "His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Herbert!\u201d she screamed. \u201cIt\u2019s Herbert!\u201d", "She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.", "\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he whispered hoarsely.", "\u201cIt\u2019s my boy; it\u2019s Herbert!\u201d she cried, struggling mechanically. \u201cI forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door.\u201d", "\u201cFor God\u2019s sake don\u2019t let it in,\u201d cried the old man, trembling.", "\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of your own son,\u201d she cried, struggling. \u201cLet me go. I\u2019m coming, Herbert; I\u2019m coming.\u201d", "There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman\u2019s voice, strained and panting.", "\u201cThe bolt,\u201d she cried, loudly. \u201cCome down. I can\u2019t reach it.\u201d", "But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If he could only find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey\u2019s paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.", "The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond.

It was a one-woman show where she alternatively talked and sang, and the format did not suit her. Her tragedies, such as they were, were not compelling, or at least she did not tell them in a compelling way. \u201cIn addition to sacrificing introspection for inspirational homilies (\u2018God has never let me down\u2019),\u201d", ", who at the time was the", "\u2019 lead drama critic, \u201cthe star regards her personal history from an omniscient and self-deifying perspective.\u201d Lee was a great self-mythologizer, and one who\u2019d given so many interviews by that point that she could perhaps be forgiven for confusing good press with good theater, in retrospect.", "But then, the whole thing was cursed from the get-go by her insecurities. Gavin tells of a producer bringing Elizabeth Taylor to a backer\u2019s audition, hoping her mere presence would \u201cloosen [investor] purse strings.\u201d The strategy was a sound one but it obviously implied to Lee that she needed a booster shot of glamour to make her life an appealing commercial project.", "And as Lee began singing through the show, Taylor lit a cigarette. Lee \u201ccoughed lightly\u201d to try to get Taylor to stop smoking. It didn\u2019t work.", "Lee would finish the audition, but it was an agreed-upon disaster. Her confidence in the project fatally wounded, the rest of the process would see her oscillate between extreme self-aggrandizement and explosive temper. She kept trying to introduce her own verse into the ever-changing script, but even then could not remember her lines. The production staff became frustrated with her and mocked her appearance. (Gavin has them passing notes like, \u201cSHE LOOKS LIKE TRUMAN CAPOTE IN DRAG.\u201d)", "But on closing night, she said to a full house, \u201cI love it here, I wanted to stay.\u201d", "Gavin\u2019s biography positions the disaster of the entire affair as the fault of Lee\u2019s eccentricities and difficult temper\u2014this is a biography written by someone who is very uncomfortable with the mercury in his subject\u2014but it feels like he misses the pathos in the middle of it, the part where someone so celebrated is in possession of almost no self-esteem at all.", "Contrast that disaster, after all, with the fact that the central feature of Peggy Lee\u2019s singing is control. And by that, I don\u2019t simply mean the way she could hold an audience\u2019s attention. For one thing, she sang at relatively low volume. Like a number of other singers, Lee benefitted from the use of microphones; belting was no longer a required skill to be heard over the band. \u201c", ",\u201d inarguably her most famous track, is mostly purred. Even the small, exclaimed \u201cfever!\u201d lines are not terribly", ". All of her singing testifies in favor of \u201cless is more.\u201d", "But the seductive qualities of her voice were often related to that control, too. It let her appear to be holding something back, to adopt that woman-of-mystery pose. She sang like someone people should want to know more about, but like someone who would not, necessarily, answer their questions. Sometimes she presented herself as someone who didn\u2019t even", "to talk about herself. She did her most haunting work on lyrics like those in \u201c", ", where the speaker adopts a performative indifference to the tragedies she sees behind her:", "There is, of course, no doubt that Lee\u2019s style was not quite inborn. Early in her career, she, like any budding artist, imitated the artists she admired, sometimes to the point of them no longer finding it flattering. Gavin attributes some of her early singing style to Bing Crosby.

It\u2019s also hard not to think that Frank hasn\u2019t quite earned this particular moment of salvation, that his condescending attitude toward Ezekiel Lewis hasn\u2019t really come in for enough implied authorial criticism. This is why the distance between the author and the character matters\u2014because there are moments when the author steps out quietly from behind the character in an effort to make us feel something, even if it\u2019s just a sense of closure, or a small bit of hope. And while I think that Ford intended me to feel both closure and hope when this book ended, they are not what I felt. I felt frustrated that he hadn\u2019t more fully imagined Ezekiel Lewis, and that he had used the character a little too easily to redeem his protagonist from a difficult moment.

In this issue Rilly sets aside the continuing tale that has occupied the first three issues\u2014gone, for the moment, are aspiring actress Vickie and her law-clerk roommate Frances\u2014and instead publishes a series of elliptical, heart-rending short stories, set both on worlds faraway and unfamiliar and in towns recognizably our own.

At stake is how a line\u2019s rhythmic propulsion (or", ") can unite with a moment of clear, articulated perception so that the whole thing turns incandescent with energy.

And I\u2019m truly no longer interested in either hurting or being hurt.\u201d Wark\u2019s emails lose a bit of their ardor at that point, the courtship seemingly curdled by Acker\u2019s compulsive self-exposure.

I love being someone\u2019s object,\u201d Wark never really responds to this admission, choosing instead to focus on the books she\u2019d previously mentioned.

Her need was great.\u201d At the point of these letters, however, the feral persona Acker had spent a lifetime cultivating had become a kind of prison. Acker\u2019s work always insists that the self is a mutable fiction, but she had been frozen into a very specific, and easily caricatured, image\u2014one no less troublesome for the fact that she herself constructed it. As she writes to Wark: \u201c\u2026 the KATHY ACKER that YOU WANT (as you put it), is another MICKEY MOUSE, you probably know her better than I do. It\u2019s media, Ken. It\u2019s not me.\u201d The \u201cme\u201d that Acker shows Wark in these letters is much more fragile and vulnerable.

This is the \u201ccentral sadness\u201d of her marriage. Games, vacations, and the fragrant totems of foodie culture bore her. (\u201cI do not enjoy most activities that are commonly labeled \u2018fun,\u2019 \u201d Daum notes, with mordant pleasure. \u201cI am weary of happiness, both as a word and as a concept.\u201d) She dislikes working too hard for things, preferring to stay within her comfort zone. \u201cThough I probably shouldn\u2019t admit this,\u201d she admits, \u201cthe activities and pursuits in which I\u2019ve achieved any measure of success are, without exception, activities and pursuits that came easily to me from the beginning.\u201d", "Daum wants us to understand that the dream of authenticity is its own kind of sentimental romance.", "Daum is not simply unburdening herself with this litany of unflattering facts\u2014if they are indeed unflattering, rather than forgivable and human. She offers the examples in order to interrogate sentimentality, the myths we wrap around our lives. Like Leslie Jamison, whose essay collection", "was published", ", Daum pokes at how \u201chuman experiences too often come with preassigned emotional responses.\u201d This brooks-no-malarkey pose feels genuine\u2014but Daum complicates it as well. In the essay \u201cHonorary Dyke,\u201d Daum frames a lifelong attraction to butchness as an allergic flinch from all the butterfly barm of femininity: the baby showers, the dating rigmaroles, the cosmetic rites, the self-absorption. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to take care of our families or have beautiful, meticulously kept homes or that we can\u2019t have strong opinions about furniture upholstery,\u201d Daum says of \u201caspirational dykes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s that we\u2019re going to express these opinions \u2026 with a certain anti-girliness, a certain lack of bullshit.\u201d Her sense of belonging later wanes a bit when she accompanies her trial-girlfriend to a gay bar\u2014all \u201cunironic mullets\u201d and \u201cmafia wives\u201d\u2014and realizes \u201cI was not a lesbian so much as someone who appreciated a good haircut.\u201d", "In \u201cThe Dog Exception,\u201d Daum explains why she associates Malamutes with unicorns. Dogs are \u201cincapable of phoniness,\u201d she writes, \u201cimmune to manufactured emotion or self-engineered cuteness.\u201d She grew up in a household that prized \u201csubstance\u201d\u2014so much so that her mother urged her, at 7, to devise a more impressively original message for her birthday cake than \u201cHappy Birthday, Meghan.\u201d (They wound up with \u201cHappy Birthday, Animal Lover,\u201d an inscription that, in its flirtation with obscene innuendo, seems like karmic comeuppance for terrible parenting.)", "Yet Daum also knows that her tough \u201cantischmaltz policy\u201d is itself a posture, another writerly narrative. She allows us glimpses of gauze, from her precept that \u201cthe human heart is pretty pie chart resistant\u201d to her faith (not borne out by her experience as an advocate for foster-care kids) that \u201cnurture from a loving adoptive community\u201d might \u201ctriumph over the abuses of horrible natural parents.\u201d Dogs reduce her to a pile of goo, and ironically their lack of affectation only stokes her belief in a fanciful, cartoonish afterlife for pets. For all her straight talk, Daum wants us to understand that the dream of authenticity is its own kind of sentimental romance. Authenticity, she seems to say, is our buzzy shorthand for truth, which we count on to do what myths do: light up the dark, scary spaces. Confronted with the unknowability of an animal\u2019s mind, with a perceived absence of counterfeit, we can\u2019t help but \u201cfill it with rainbows and wet furrylicious kisses.\u201d", "But reality versus our willful insulation from same isn\u2019t Daum\u2019s big theme, even if the introduction says it is. Instead, these essays do what essays often set out to do: trace the outlines of a self. They show an author exposing her particular being to the world, watching what happens, and coming to terms with the fallout. And they do it wonderfully, weaving a theory of identity as both unknowable and inescapable. \u201cNot What It Used to Be,\u201d for example, hearkens back to Daum\u2019s first collection,", "in its elegy for lost time. In middle age, Daum writes, \u201cany traces of precocity I ever had are long forgotten. I am not and will never again be a young writer, a young homeowner, a young teacher. \u2026 The only thing I could do now for which my youth would be a truly notable feature would be to die.\u201d This should give you a flavor of her wry, piquant voice. (Or try this: \u201cAnthropologie \u2026 is to adult women what princesses are to little girls. It is a twirling motion in the form of an international brand.\u201d) Yet despite the fading of some shiny sense of possibility, the \u201colder self of our imagination never quite folds itself into the older self we actually become.\u201d \u201cLife,\u201d Daum concludes, \u201cis mostly an exercise in being something other than what we used to be while remaining fundamentally\u2014and sometimes maddeningly\u2014who we are.\u201d", "is strewn with Daum\u2019s attempts to lose herself, and with her slow, painful returns to center. She dabbles in gayness, in ill-fitting maternal roles. She tries, Emerson-like, to cast herself not as a human being but as a disembodied eye in the universe. (\u201cLos Angeles is where I learned that your ability to see is sometimes only as good as your willingness to go unseen,\u201d she writes at one point, wearing her invisibility at a gathering of Hollywood stars as a badge of honor.) There is a beautiful sway in these essays in and out of self-awareness.\u00a0And as Daum tests the edges of who she is, the reader feels similar waves of identification and then distance, at times resonating intimately to a point the narrator makes, at times feeling that their two consciousnesses don\u2019t overlap at all.", "There\u2019s a moment of arrival, or maybe just repose, in a late essay, where Daum seems to stake out her boundaries for good. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s highly overrated,\u201d she writes, striking a note somewhere between self-mockery and earned wisdom. (In Daum\u2019s world, maturity is not mellow, but tart.) \u201cGoing outside your comfort zone.\u201d She continues: \u201cStay in safe waters but plunge as deeply into them as possible. If you\u2019re good at something, do it a lot. If you\u2019re bad at something, just don\u2019t do it.\u201d", "But Daum also succeeds in losing herself in these pages. The last piece, \u201cDiary of a Coma,\u201d recounts a terrifying bout of murine typhus, a rare bacterial infection that first takes away Daum\u2019s words and then pushes her out of consciousness. The hyper-articulate voice we\u2019ve come to trust describes the terror of aphasia, the dispersal of an inner life into fragments that can\u2019t be grasped or said. Then, coming out of the illness, Daum writes, \u201cI am locating the letters of the alphabet \u2026 I am coming back to myself. And I am no wiser or more evolved than I was before. There is no epiphany or revelation or aha moment or big click. There is no redemption. There is no great lesson learned. There is only the unknowable and the unspeakable.\u201d", "Which suggests, contra the promise of the introduction, that Daum\u2019s \u201cunspeakable\u201d isn\u2019t some transformative truth finally spoken once you work up the courage. It is what you get instead of a payoff. It is the silence after you\u2019ve said all you can say and done all you can do (i.e. after you\u2019ve lived a life on Earth). For Daum, maybe, it was the condition of drifting away from herself, as in a coma, and finding nothing but blank space\u2014since, as she now knows and insists, you can never really be someone other than who you are.", "---", ", by Meghan Daum.

{"Body": ["Illustration by Jon Chadurjian.", ", by the Japanese novelist and scholar Minae Mizumura, has all the ingredients of a rage-read. Indeed, when it was published in Japan in 2008, it", ", who dismissed Mizumura as \u201creactionary,\u201d \u201cjingoistic,\u201d or \u201celitist\u201d and swarmed across Amazon deleting positive reviews. More than 65,000 copies have sold since then\u2014which suggests the slender work\u2019s declinist soothsaying continues to touch a nerve. The book appears this month in English (enemy territory!), where\u2014if we Yanks could be trusted to read something first penned in a non-Western tongue\u2014it would likely inspire more umbrage, more name-calling, more amorphous unease. The book\u2019s basic premise, developed in a sinuous line through seven chapters, is that every language creates and nourishes untranslatable truths. Dominant languages infuse their verities into the wider world, crowding out alternative visions from more minor tongues. Linguistic asymmetry isn\u2019t new\u2014over the past two centuries, Latin, classical Chinese, and French each took a turn in the sun\u2014but never has one language so completely eclipsed the rest, Mizumura says, as today, in the age of the Internet, with English.", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "And have you heard? English is a tuneless, careless juggernaut! English has a tendency to favor science over art, sound over image, market value over intrinsic cultural worth. (For Chrissake, English spawned", ", which Mizumura clearly wants to assign to everlasting torment in its own circle of hell.) Her disdain\u2014mostly implied, but sometimes explicit, as when she describes Americans as \u201cgrown tall and stout on too many hamburgers and French fries\u201d\u2014might lose Mizumura some Anglophone readers. But it shouldn\u2019t. Every writer need not love English, or English speakers. And we might benefit from attending to the critiques of someone who refuses to kiss the ring.", "You can find reasons to jump on the angry bandwagon: Mizumura\u2019s tone", "sound disagreeably peevish, bitter, or despairing; she doesn\u2019t bother disguising her scorn for the United States; nor does she shrink from dismissing the entire contemporary fiction scene in Japan as \u201cjust juvenile.\u201d (That last is what set off the initial batch of protests.) But these critiques come to feel superficial in the face of the book\u2019s lucidity, erudition, and force.", "Mizumura\u2019s first shrewd move is to start with a personal essay, which puts the book\u2019s center of gravity in a lyrical, literary space somewhere above all the consequent salvos of angry scholarship. (Since", "will go on to tease apart \u201cacademic\u201d and \u201cnovelistic\u201d truths, reserving more love and reverence for the latter, this is a wise call.) In \u201cUnder the Blue Sky of Iowa,\u201d she hangs a wreath of personal details on a monthlong international writers\u2019 conference. We learn of her addiction to Agatha Christie audiobooks and her poor health\u2014Mizumura suffers from \u201cautonomic dystonia,\u201d and envisioned her Iowa stay as a \u201cresort idyll\u201d where \u201cI could \u2026 spend my days reading and walking \u2026 letting my mind and body unwind in the tranquil flow of time.\u201d Most importantly, she arrives at the conference \u201cwith a hidden vow to keep my participation to a minimum.\u201d Isolating herself proves easier than expected, as few of the writers speak comfortable English (and none have fluent Japanese). The ghost of an allegory begins to emerge from Mizumura\u2019s careful descriptions of the blue sky, the yellowing leaves, the authors passing each other wordlessly in the halls at night, unable to communicate. She imagines them hunched over their computers, scoring thoughts to the faint music of their own language. \u201cI grew more and more haunted by the idea that we might be a group of people headed for a downfall,\u201d she writes. The participants represent a prism of different tongues, but \u201cin the sense that we might be headed for a downfall, we were all the same.\u201d", "Languages have materiality, Mizumura insists, and her personal essay-cum-allegory lets the landscape of English letters hover like a mirage above physical America. In Iowa \u201cthe view was not particularly beautiful. There was none of the poetry one sees in scenes of the countryside in American films.\u201d Yet \u201cturning to Chris [the program director], I roused myself and said exactly what an American might say at such a moment: \u2018Beautiful day!\u2019 \u201d Such are the dangers of a universal language: Being in America, speaking \u201cAmerican,\u201d Mizumura can utter only \u201cwhat an American might say,\u201d even if that means lying about the blighted prospect around her. In contrast, here is the author\u2019s memory of touching down in France: \u201cOnce I set foot in Paris, I was greeted with boulevards shimmering with new leaves and skies gloriously liberated from the dark of winter.\u201d", "I mention France because the French language\u2014all libert\u00e9 and illumination\u2014is one of Mizumura\u2019s sanctuaries, a spiritual alternative to English. (It is also a scholarly alternative: Though she doesn\u2019t mention him outright, Mizumura, who studied French literature at Yale during its Structuralist heyday, is clearly indebted to", ", one of the first to propose that meaning arises from closed linguistic systems. Saussure wrote in French.) Her family moved from Japan to New York when she was 12, and she \u201cstubbornly resisted getting along either with the United States or the English language,\u201d instead soaking in French audiobooks on repeat in her room. What draws Mizumura to the lingua franca of the Enlightenment is its beauty, but also its predicament: Once the embodiment of the \u201csoul of Europe,\u201d a standard-bearer for the humanities, the expressive Play-Doh for writers like Voltaire and Diderot is now in the same lamentable position as Japanese. Which is to say, French and Japanese speakers are confined to the particular, while English speakers live in the universal.", "A writer writing in English can count on her words reaching people all over the world, whether in translation or the original, but there\u2019s no guarantee English-speaking readers will ever encounter experiences first framed in Japanese. Nor can bilingual writers just switch to English: Even if the West does not seem \u201ctoo far, psychologically as well as geographically,\u201d a sense of romance surrounds novels written in the novelist\u2019s mother tongue, making fiction formulated from a second language less palatable. So, Mizumura concludes, non-English speakers \u201ccan only participate passively in the universal temporality \u2026 they cannot make their own voices heard.\u201d Discouraged by the deafness of the world\u2014even as Internet fans sing about our increasing connectedness\u2014they might decide to stop writing altogether.", "The French language\u2014all libert\u00e9 and illumination\u2014is one of Mizumura\u2019s sanctuaries, a spiritual alternative to English.", "When writers stop writing in a language, that language decays. People lose faith in its ability to bear the burden of their fine feeling and entrust their most important thoughts elsewhere. Raging against the decline of \u201clesser\u201d lexicons, Mizumura is stressing more than the loss of cultural artifacts, or the value of diversity for its own sake. Non-dominant tongues must live on, she warns, because \u201cthose of us \u2026 living in asymmetry are the only ones condemned to perpetually reflect upon language, the only ones forced to know that the English language cannot dictate \u2018truths\u2019 and that there are other \u2018truths\u2019 in this world.\u201d Buried in that argument is an oddly touching one about the nature of literature: \u201cThe writer must see the language not as a transparent medium for self-expression or the representation of reality, but as a medium one must struggle with to make it do one\u2019s bidding.\u201d", "I\u2019m not sure if I share Mizumura\u2019s pessimism regarding the transfer of meaning between tongues\u2014I\u2019m no Saussurean, and while maybe our \u201crice\u201d can\u2019t capture the mythical freight of the Japanese \u201cine,\u201d I tend to think sensitive and knowledgeable workarounds can go a long way. (For example, Mizumura seems to underestimate the power of a good translator, which is a shame given the lovely translation given her by Mari Yoshihara and Juliet Winters Carpenter.) But I do believe that writers should be wrestling with words, rather than deploying them thoughtlessly. And I\u2019m ready to stand behind any author who is (rudely, furiously) urging us all to the mat.", "Some of the deepest pleasures in", "lie in Mizumura\u2019s historical analysis. She attacks the (Western) premise that written language merely represents spoken language, pointing out that most people into modernity yelled at their kids in local dialect while reading and writing (if they were literate) in an \u201cexternal\u201d tongue. This \u201cuniversal\u201d language usually belonged to an older, grander civilization, like Rome or classical China; to it were entrusted the texts that embodied intellectual, aesthetic, or ethical excellence. Yet as mass printing transformed books into commodities, the market for works in the elite language was soon saturated. A cadre of bilinguals began to translate them into the vernacular, devising grammar rules as they went. With the glories of the \u201cuniversal\u201d libraries being gradually emptied into these fledging tongues, the tongues themselves were elevated. They began to circulate as something more\u2014national languages\u2014suited not just to huge themes but to the fleeting dreams and textures of everyday life. Mizumura traces how the myth of the \u201cnational language,\u201d a pure upwelling of political character, coincided with the flowering of the nation-state\u2014and, even more fascinatingly, of the novel itself. To her, it is no coincidence that literature began to aim at new forms of self-expression just as common people were developing an argot that could swing from God to the gutter, and the written mediums for scientific learning were growing more receptive to questions of humanistic truth.", "At some point in all this, you realize: \u201cLanguage\u201d may be in the book\u2019s title, but Mizumura has really crafted a conservationist\u2019s plea for", ". Discussing the golden age of Japanese modernist fiction, she introduces us to Natsume Soseki, who penned the novel", "in 1909, 41 years after the Meiji Restoration opened Japan to the West. In an early scene, the na\u00efve student Sanshiro meets a shabby man on a university-bound train; he is Professor Hirota, a liberal arts scholar specializing in English, and he informs Sanshiro that their homeland \u201cis headed for a fall.\u201d Hirota, steeped in lettered arcana, knows all there is to know about the Western canon. But his learning lies fallow\u2014he writes nothing, publishes nothing\u2014and his houseboy calls him \u201cthe Great Darkness\u201d for his ability to absorb the splendors of English literature without emitting any light of his own. The professor has failed the Japanese language, of course, in ways that are painfully relevant to Mizumura\u2019s argument. But the author also weaves in a stray detail: that, over the course of their conversation on the train, Hirota unfolds for Sanshiro \u201cthe curious story of Leonardo da Vinci injecting arsenic into the trunk of a peach tree experimentally, to see if the poison would circulate to the fruit.\u201d", "Who says \"It's a beautiful day\" on a consistent basis? \u00a0Who is forced into saying it here in the US?", "", "-DukeLaw", "", "", "", "I have no idea why Mizumura airdrops this quoted anecdote into her book\u2014the sentence ends and she never remarks on it again. Still, it\u2019s striking. As a description of a scientific investigation, the story means one thing. As a capsule of literary truth\u2014the kind of spectral allegory Mizumura conjures with her opening essay\u2014it feels almost unbearably alive with import. Even without the Western interplay of trees, wisdom, and death, Hirota\u2019s \u201ccurious\u201d tale\u2014flowing here from Europe to Japan to the United States\u2014captures something real about ambition, curiosity, courage, and cruelty; about alluring goals and bitter aftertastes; about connection, circulation, and disjuncture. It rewards a literary way of thinking one hundredfold. And I felt that, if Mizumura is right that literature demands us to be conscious of the particular language we\u2019re manipulating, and that such consciousness cannot exist without linguistic diversity, we should perhaps be devoting more of our lives to protecting linguistic diversity. (Or \u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u591a\u69d8\u6027\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77\u306b\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u6367\u3052\u308b.) As she writes, the same polyphonic jostle of tongues that \u201ccondemns\u201d us to \u201creflect perpetually upon language,\u201d and upon literature, has a singular power to leave us \u201chumble, and mature, and wise.\u201d", "---", "by Minae Mizumura.

An inveterate collector of objects, young Highway finds work as a sort of personnel crisis manager at a juice factory outside Mexico City, but in midlife he discovers his true calling: He becomes an auctioneer, training in the \u201cfour types of auctions: circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic.\u201d He successfully bids on a set of teeth supposedly belonging to Marilyn Monroe and has them implanted in his own mouth, only to later lose them when, in a moment of auctioneering hubris, he sells his entire self to his estranged son, Siddhartha.

But Highway believes so firmly in himself\u2014in his own \u201cperseverance, discretion, and discipline,\u201d in his destiny, in the glory of his Monrovian teeth\u2014that it is hard not to do the same. Aside from his charming braggadocio, he has other fine qualities. He is thoughtful on contemporary issues of material culture: \u201cI wasn\u2019t just a lowly seller of objects but, first and foremost, a lover and collector of good stories, which is the only honest way of modifying the value of an object.\u201d He refers frequently to a large tribe of relations, including his uncles Juan S\u00e1nchez Baudrillard, Miguel S\u00e1nchez Foucault, Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Proust, Roberto S\u00e1nchez Walser, and Fredo S\u00e1nchez Dostoyevsky.

From an unusual writer, for starters.

In a way, though, the subjects were almost irrelevant.

(Since 2013, the collection has also been displayed through a more accessible museum, in Mexico City.)", "Commissioned to write a work of fiction for a Galer\u00eda Jumex catalog, Luiselli found herself at a dizzying vantage point for this globalized age. \u201cThere is, naturally, a gap between the two worlds: gallery and factory, artists and workers, artwork and juice. How could I link the two distant but neighboring worlds, and could literature play a mediating role?\u201d she writes in an afterword. \u201cI decided to write tangentially\u2014even allegorically\u2014about the art world, and to focus on the life of the factory. I also decided to write not so much", "but", "the factory workers.\u201d To do so, she sent installments of the fiction from New York to the workers, listened to recordings of them discussing it, and continued the story accordingly. She also deployed locals to gather photos of Ecatepec, so she could locate the story among its landmarks. (Some of the locals, like one El Perro, made it into the novel as characters themselves.) Until Luiselli finally revealed herself, the writing was presented under the name of a man known otherwise as Highway: Gustavo S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez.", "This procedure goes far in explaining both this book\u2019s quirkiness and its very un-Rousselian eagerness to please. On one hand, the book features highbrow \u201callegories\u201d based on works by Jumex collection artists like Olafur Eliasson\u2014or, as cited here, Olafur S\u00e1nchez Eliasson. On the other, Luiselli is emulating crowd-pleasing serial fiction writers of the 19", "century\u2014her formula, she writes, might be \u201cDickens + MP3 \u00f7 Balzac + JPEG\u201d\u2014and so even those weird allegories tend toward the rollicking and personable. The Eliasson one involves an old, \u201calmost venerable\u201d rabbit named Cockerspaniel who likes to sleep in the sun; in the end, he is slain for dinner.", "If this book offers an allegory for the art world, what does it say? \u201cWhen the bar was starting to close,\u201d Jacobo de Voragine recounts toward the end of the book, \u201cthe owner would let Highway auction his stories. It was at Secret of Night\u201d\u2014a real bar, whose photo appears in the book\u2014\u201cthat Highway finally put into practice the now full-fledged theory of his famous allegoric method, where it is not objects that are sold, but the stories that give them value and meaning.\u201d", "Contemporary art can indeed work something like that: Objects gain value through the stories attached, and, as Luiselli suggests, they can lose value by leaving the museum to become just one more mysterious possession in a fanatical auctioneer\u2019s collection. In", "the stories that Luiselli has attached to the people, buildings, and companies of Ecatepec alter their value, touching them with the glow of literary inspiration. At the same time, she pulls revered artists and writers out of the museum and the library, recycling them as characters, even metaphorically adopting them as relatives.", "In her blend of truth and fiction, in her tinkering with the value of art and its makers, Luiselli becomes a kind of auctioneer herself. She might even reach the high standard of Gustavo S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez, who on his deathbed leaves a note to his son full of characteristically humane bluster.

Poetry, she claims, can get away with stopping readers in their tracks, asking them to admire the elegance of its constructions. By contrast, prose (narrative prose, at any rate) cannot do so without sacrificing some key component of itself. Transforming this distinction into a critical guideline, Le Guin reads the work of other writers accordingly.

Yet you blithely spend $100 (or more) for a pair of new shoes that you don\u2019t really need when the same money, donated to the proper charity, could easily save the lives of several children in a developing nation.", "One activist refused to wash his own dishes. He told his wife it was more important to spend that time working for animals.", "Singer\u2019s argument, which sparked the practical revival of a branch of moral philosophy known as utilitarianism, is the heartbeat of", ". Not all of the people MacFarquhar writes about cite it; in particular, a clan of Indian humanitarians, who founded both a leper colony and a clinic compound for a beleaguered jungle tribe, seems largely unconcerned with Western theories about philanthropy. But many of the Americans the author interviewed have been involved with or touched by a movement called \u201ceffective altruism,\u201d which has used Singer\u2019s thought experiment as a springboard for rationalizing charity.", "Effective altruists believe in measuring exactly how much suffering can be relieved by exactly how much effort and then maximizing the results. At one meeting MacFarquhar describes, a French guest who had founded a children\u2019s health clinic in Kenya was \u201cstartled and bewildered to discover that this effort was not much valued by the effective altruists.\u201d If he had instead devoted himself to maximizing his First World salary, the money he would have been able to donate would have paid for enough local workers to accomplish much more.", "Like the woman who wept over her candy apple, the effective altruists, despite seeming extreme, technically have a point.", "into the Red Cross\u2019 inadequate relief work following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and 2012\u2019s Hurricane Sandy revealed that feel-good outpourings of public generosity need to be backed up with demands for rigorous accountability from the charities that receive it. Yet the movement seems to attract people whose obsession with quantifying morality justifies a lack of quotidian compassion. One animal rights activist, who chose to defend chickens because with them he believed he could maximize the quantity of suffering he could eliminate, refused to wash his own dishes. He told his wife that it was more important to spend that time working for animals.", "Several of the stories MacFarquhar tells in", "involve earnest young women involved with such men. One has a boyfriend who feels sure that, with enough work, he could profoundly change the world, so he limits himself to sleeping only three hours a night. When she tries to temper his zeal, \u201cshe would write a long series of numbered arguments, and he would send back replies such as: \u2018I disagree with premise 4 of your argument, please clarify how you are using the word \u201cdifficult,\u201d here are five possible definitions of the word, which one do you mean?\u2019 \u201d Another notices that the effective altruism meetings she attends with her boyfriend are overwhelmingly populated with \u201cwell-educated young white men of technological background and rational disposition.\u201d For many, that description will conjure up memories of long, wearisome conversations with libertarians, say, or atheists, whose utter confidence that they have figured everything out seems a stark contrast with their clumsiness in managing ordinary human interactions.", "Courtesy of Philip Gourevitch", "Still, it\u2019s not just this new breed of do-gooder who strikes the average observer as a bit off. MacFarquhar provides a capsule history of the mistrust the breed has inspired, culminating in a consideration of what she regards as the do-gooder\u2019s most implacable and persuasive critic: the modern novel. Freudians deemed altruism a covert form of masochistic power trip. Anthropologists insisted that one-way giving undermines the social bonding achieved by reciprocal exchanges and makes the recipient feel humiliated. Pop psychologists labeled the self-sacrificing behavior of the spouses of alcoholics \u201ccodependency\u201d and called all such behavior a disease. Novelists, who consider themselves the bards of humanity at its most complex and flawed, have exhibited a pronounced distrust of saints. From Charles Dickens\u2019 Mrs. Jellyby, in", "who neglects her own children and husband to campaign for the unfortunate in far-off Africa\u2014to Ralph Eldred in Hilary Mantel\u2019s", "who takes in disturbed children, even though they abuse his family \u2014fictional characters who place principle over those closest to them are almost always depicted as misguided and destructive.", "Oddly enough, the one contemporary viewpoint the otherwise brilliant", "skimps on a bit is that of moral philosophy. Singer may be accounted for, but not so the proliferation in recent years of", "\u2014or, in the sprightly coinage of philosophy professor Kwame Anthony Appiah, \u201ctrolleyology.\u201d You\u2019ve probably heard a version of it: You stand on a bridge over a forking trolley track, beside a switch that can direct an oncoming trolley over one branch of the fork or the other. An out-of-control trolley comes hurtling down the track, which is currently aligned so that the car will run over five people tied to that branch. One person is tied to the other branch. Do you flip the switch, thereby saving the lives of five people but causing the death of one?", "As Singer himself", ", most people, when presented with this scenario, think it is acceptable or right to pull the switch. However, if there\u2019s no switch, and the only way to stop the trolley from running over five people is to push one (very large) man off the bridge and onto the tracks, most people regard this choice as beyond the pale. Why? Some philosophers think it\u2019s because pushing the fat man onto the tracks constitutes a deliberate murder while throwing the switch is more like manslaughter, a killing that occurs, regrettably, in the course of saving other lives. Still others think the switch introduces an element of impersonality that actually pushing the man\u2019s body off the bridge denies.", "At the very least, though, trolley problems suggest the degree to which morality is largely", "rational, contrary to all the efforts of the effective altruists to make it so. Why should it be, when it is entirely the creation of flawed human beings living in weak and mortal bodies? Morality springs from emotion, and emotion fuels it. Most of us care more about people who are close to our bodies than those who are far away, and above all we usually care more about people who inhabit bodies related to the ones we inhabit. But if we didn\u2019t have bodies, we wouldn\u2019t care about anyone at all. It\u2019s the prospect of contact with that poor man\u2019s body, the sensation of our own hands sinking into and thrusting his human flesh to its death, that makes the \u201cfat man problem\u201d so sickening to contemplate. Let\u2019s not even talk about the fact that we\u2019d need to look him in the eyes while doing it. This stuff was never a numbers game.", "Interesting article.  This is a tension I have long felt, myself, although I am decidedly not such a do-gooder if we look at the ways in which I spend my time and money.", "", "-SPGxGPS@gmail.com", "", "", "", "Self-sacrifice is also human, as MacFarquhar points out. We\u2019re stirred by tales of heroic deeds, like the firefighters who rushed into the World Trade Center on 9/11, or the capacity of generous fellow feeling to reach across the globe, like the", "when they learned of the Potato Famine in 1847. (That one never fails to make me tear up.) So why are we so unsettled by people who push the impulse toward charity and selflessness even further? Why do we insinuate that they are deluded, manipulative, destructive, and even mentally ill?", "Do-gooders take something we all want to believe is quintessentially human\u2014the willingness to extend ourselves to strangers\u2014and place it in direct conflict with something that is even more fundamentally human: caring for our own. The result is a bit like a reverse version of the famed Uncanny Valley effect, in which a representation of a human being becomes more disturbing as its resemblance to an actual human being increases. Do-gooders are already human, of course, but as they ratchet up their selflessness, they begin, ever so slightly, to depart from the fold.

He spent the winter of 1966\u201367 in what he called \u201ca kind of natural conversation with all three generations\u201d of his neighbors, capturing their thoughts on \u201cfarming, education, welfare, class, religion and indeed life and death.\u201d The best-selling book that resulted captured the changing nature of English rural life, and it has remained in print in England ever since as a Penguin Modern Classic.", "was also greeted enthusiastically in America, receiving rave reviews from John Updike, Paul Fussell, John Leonard, and Jan Morris (then still writing as James)", "Tellingly, many of the reviews hailed", "as \u201ca classic of its kind,\u201d judiciously dodging the question of just what kind of book it might be. The original Penguin edition classified it as \u201cSociology/Anthropology,\u201d which was fitting given its blend of popular ethnography and sociological survey.", "But Blythe saw it less as a work of social science or oral history than as a travel book. He described writing it as \u201cmaking a strange journey to a familiar land,\u201d and like George Orwell\u2019s", "or Alfred Kazin\u2019s", ", Blythe\u2019s grand achievement in", "is fundamentally that of the writer as eyewitness reporter, as traveler with a fresh eye and a great ear for language. These are books that ignore the question of what experience", "and instead burrow deeply, richly into describing experience itself.

We meet women and men, the old and the young, all of them identified simply by age and vocation: There are farm owners and farmworkers, a plowman, a shepherd, orchardmen, teachers and students, a deacon, a group of bell ringers, a blacksmith, a wheelwright, a thatcher, a saddler, a military man, a doctor, a nurse, a vet, a poet, a gravedigger. The book opens with the 71-year-old farmworker Leonard Thompson, in a section called \u201cThe Survivors,\u201d who tells the story of having first left the village for the war in 1914. What the English experienced in the trenches of the western front or, as in Thompson\u2019s case, of Gallipoli, was famously a shock, but even amid the vast and horrifying literature of World War I, there may be few passages more viscerally affecting than Thompson\u2019s:", "There are dozens of passages like this one in", ", moments when a reader is forced to pay closer attention, to notice as much as the people of Akenfield do.

I don\u2019t open a church door without looking at the hinges.\u201d Or when the gravedigger insists, \u201cI can always tell if a person is dead by looking at the eyes.

Blythe recognized that under the placid surface of a place as seemingly unchanging as Akenfield lay a clash of virtual tectonic plates, as a class-riven, tradition-bound, nearly feudal community began to erupt and fissure.", "The people of Akenfield express deep reverence for the past and its traditions, and at the same time an overwhelming urge to leave it all behind\u2014and this tension gives", "its distinctive drama.", "Still from", "The villagers describe with palpable regret bits of knowledge that were fast being lost\u2014how to shape a corn-dolly, how to thatch a roof.

Hands last a long time, you know. A village sees the same hands century after century. It is a marvellous thing but it\u2019s true.\u201d Their heartfelt faith in an older order and a slower way of doing things, which even in 1966 was disappearing, can sometimes turn comic: \u201cLife now is much less elaborate and, consequently, much less interesting,\u201d says a gardener. \u201c[The newcomers] buy expensive ugly things.

But it wasn\u2019t pleasant then, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d The owner of the harness shop, in recounting for Blythe the traditional way he makes harnesses from horsehide and cowhide\u2014\u201cWe worked the fat in with a bone, just as a soldier bones his boots\u201d\u2014looks back with pride on the quality of his work, but he recognizes the irony. \u201cOur harness lasted for ever, as you might say.

The book\u2019s lasting power lies in the way it takes those lives, which might otherwise be missed or seem too circumscribed to draw in great detail, and renders them fully, richly, memorably. As Blythe later remarked: \u201cI think my view of human life is how brief and curious most people\u2019s lives are. Yet when you come to talk to them you realize how strong they are and how unbelievably rich their lives are; also how subtle and various.\u201d Or as Updike once put it, \u201cPerhaps, as Proust suggested, the transformation of experience by memory into something ineffably precious is the one transcendent meaning each life does wrest from death.\u201d", "In 2004, the writer Craig Taylor was commissioned by", "magazine to return to the village in Suffolk on which", "was based to see how things had changed in the generation since the book appeared.

When Elinor\u2019s sister (and some readers) accuse her of being without sensibility, they have misunderstood the way she channels herself into observation rather than ego. She intentionally reins in the uglier emotions that swirl around female competition for husbands and status, even as she, too, \u201cwants love \u2026 aspires to happiness and happiness is marriage.\u201d Ferrante describes the outcome of this self-control as a virtuous self-effacement: \u201cElinor hides Elinor in order to become better than Elinor.\u201d", "Austen, Ferrante tells us, accomplished the same impossible balancing act. By writing anonymously, she created a \u201clady-narrator\u201d who is both a part of the world of women she describes\u2014elegant and educated yet utterly powerless, vying for the husbands on whom their futures depend\u2014and a dispassionate observer of that world. And this, Ferrante suggests in a sentence that could describe her own work as easily as Austen\u2019s, gives her the power to write with a tonal deftness that lifts her material to the level of art: \u201cThe lady-who-writes can set aside dissatisfaction and bitterness, spread a light, ironic glaze over the old world that, with its wrongs, is collapsing and the new world that is emerging, with its abundance of new wrongs.

This distance enables both Elenas to write about the theme of \u201cdissolving margins\u201d in a way that is never overwrought, but instead penetratingly precise\u2014revealing a problem that is metaphysical rather than sentimental.", "The need to create a more capacious authorial persona is, Ferrante implies, especially urgent for female writers. At the beginning of the introduction, she admits that as a teenager, she didn\u2019t care for Austen. \u201cI was enthralled by the great male adventure novels, with their stories that ranged all over the world, and I wanted to write such books myself: I couldn\u2019t resign myself to the idea that women\u2019s novels were domestic tales of love and marriage.\u201d Ferrante\u2019s own heroines do travel, and engage in the highest order of political and intellectual disputes\u2014Lila and Elena are swept up in the socialist protests of 1968, and in the early days of the feminist movement. But their dramas are also, essentially, domestic. Like Austen\u2019s novels, Ferrante\u2019s are, on at least one fundamental level, a study of good and bad marriages and how they determine women\u2019s fates. She gives her characters\u2019 lives, and their interior selves, the exigency of an adventure story by writing about them with a corresponding velocity.", "Ferrante suggests that for Austen to accomplish this, she had to invent a version of her own consciousness that transcended the limitations of her life as a woman born in the 18", "century; Austen could not write with \u201ca clear gaze\u201d about her social confinements while trapped within them.

The pair understands that their suffering is absurd, inconsequential in the face of the material deprivation that characterizes much of the world\u2014but this understanding isn\u2019t comforting. It only adds guilt to estrangement, insult to injury. The whole mess is a joke on the one hand and a tragedy on the other, as Kraus suggests in a passage at the beginning of the book: \u201cIt is 1989 or 1990. George Herbert Bush is President of the United States and the Gulf War has just begun in Saudi Arabia.\u201d She continues:", "Sylvie and Jerome\u2019s exaggerated despair boils down to this same yearning, this same desire for a relationship uncomplicated by global politics and the accompanying imperative for guilt.

How can they justify bemoaning the comfortable, first world collateral damage of their disintegrating marriage when the collateral damage of their consumptive habits has impoverished so much of the world? (In Romania, \u201cabout 35% of the population lives \u2026 below the poverty line,\u201d according to one of the newspaper clippings Kraus includes in the text.) If the world order is really so flimsy, if all change is really for the worse, what alternative is there to the wretched status quo? \u201cNo future\u201d indeed.", "Paralyzed by their awareness of pervasive injustice and their inability to alleviate it, Jerome and Sylvie fantasize about achieving apolitical purity. When Jerome touches Sylvie, she\u2019s no longer in the early \u201990s, in a milieu where her art is dismissed by virtue of her gender: Instead she becomes immaterial, \u201cimpossible to locate.\u201d \u201cWhen he makes her come,\u201d Kraus writes, \u201call this fucked-up gender stuff dissolves and she feels her body spinning backwards towards itself as different ages, 14, 11, once she went as far back as 5.\u201d", "But Jerome and Sylvie\u2019s attempt at transcendence fails spectacularly. Not only is their marriage heavily reliant on a traditional gender dynamic\u2014Sylvie\u2019s \u201calways been quite cynical about the signs of female heterosexuality, but with Jerome she feels protected, small\u201d\u2014but Jerome is actively dismissive of Sylvie as a thinker and artist. Though Sylvie edits a series of books by female authors published by Jerome\u2019s press, \u201cno one \u2026 recognizes these as Sylvie Green\u2019s ideas because his name appears before hers on the masthead. Though he hasn\u2019t had the time to read these women\u2019s books, the press, he reasons, is his art work. What\u2019s more, his name gives their work an added credibility.\u201d", "And so, unable to escape from politics but unable to meaningfully engage with them, Sylvie and Jerome ricochet back and forth, at times succumbing to their inert hopelessness, at times spurred to take fruitless action. Kraus presents few satisfactory solutions. She ends, fittingly, on an ambivalent note: Sylvie, abandoning New York for L.A. and emotional sex with Jerome for casual encounters with strangers, opts for an existence with \u201cno ancient tribal feuds, no wounds, no blood.\u201d Unable to transform her suffering into anything constructive, she chooses to stop caring. Meanwhile, Jerome writes in his therapy notebook, \u201cI have to keep bleeding \u2026 this \u2018bleeding heart\u2019 is a heart, and is all that I have.\u201d Sylvie\u2019s new life, we are told, is \u201cless absolute, perhaps, but better.\u201d While Jerome wallows in the eponymous torpor, Sylvie manages to trade in her overblown negativity for anodyne resignation.

This ambivalence energizes the book, transforming its dry citations into a debate worth following: Are lies a disease or a symptom, a problem or a makeshift solution?", "From Satan, father of lies, Denery then turns to God, wellspring and arbiter of truth.

The lesson I draw is that life may be more about discovery, and coming to terms with who we\u2019ve made ourselves into via our choices, than about carefully executing a plan for self-realization.

I\u2019m a fan of happiness research and think it can provide useful suggestions as to how to improve your life, but, still, there aren\u2019t yet the sort of robust and established findings that Sally should bet her life on.", "On the other hand, happiness is one domain where we really should all benefit from Big Data. Suppose Sally could get aggregated reports from thousands of people who are similar to her, comparing these to data from a control group who decided to stay childless. Or, to go back to my deciding-to-take-LSD example, I have heard good things about the experience from others, which is an argument in its favor. But what I really would want is data from 10,000 people just like me. If 99 percent are neutral to positive, count me in; if a sizable proportion describe it as horrific, count me out.\u00a0This sort of crowdsourcing would make for an excellent app. And it should sound familiar; it would do for life experiences what innumerable websites do for books, movies, hotels, songs, and most everything else.", "Actually, the existence of all these sites makes me wonder how natural it really is to rely on one\u2019s own intuitions and ignore third-party data, even in the domain of happiness.

And the studies find that we are bad at this; we have intuitive theories about what makes us happy but often these are quite wrong.

Not because I didn\u2019t fall in love with New York, because even though I was lonely and poor, no place had ever made me feel more at home.

Mercedes tells Ronson that 4chan\u2019s goal in shaming is \u201cto degrade the target.\u201d For men, that amounts to trying to get them fired; for women, it means rape threats. Both are based on cultural stereotypes about gender roles: that an unemployed man feels emasculated and that rape is one of the \u201chighest degradations\u201d a woman could suffer.", "This is the moment when a more politically attuned writer would dilate on the issue and further explore\u00a0the connection with the Adria Richards case. Wasn\u2019t Richards talking about some version of this\u2014that men fear embarrassment and that women fear violence? What might it mean then that public shamers often threaten to commit these very offenses?", "Ronson is a good interviewer, often eliciting astute comments from his subjects, but it seems he doesn\u2019t quite know what to make of them. I attribute this partly to the nature of the project: Ronson is seeking to get out of the public shaming mindset, to be empathic and nonjudgmental. But that leads him to indulge in a roving sentimentality that produces some false conclusions.", "Was Jonah Lehrer\u2019s life \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d? As Ronson discusses, Lehrer was still able to get a deal for a new book\u2014hardly the mark of someone without a professional future. Was Justine Sacco\u2019s life \u201cruined\u201d? Perhaps for a time it seemed so. But as shown by", ", the Gawker writer who played a role in making Sacco\u2019s fateful tweet go viral, Sacco recovered from her hardships and has a new, fulfilling job.

But we should understand that complicated (and often, political) issues are at work. Ronson may very well think that Richards\u2019 quoting of the Atwood line is extreme, but he doesn\u2019t give much thought as to why she would invoke it. What does it mean if men really do fear being fired to the same degree that women fear being raped?", "This gender gap is key to understanding public shaming. At one point in the book, Ronson signs up to do a story where he dresses as a woman and goes out into the world to see how women are treated. But it shouldn\u2019t take such a stunt to empathize with another person\u2019s point of view. One way of finding out what it\u2019s like to be a woman walking down the street is to talk to actual women.", "Photo by Emli Bendixen", "The conceptual mistake that Ronson makes here is one that dogs the book: He foregrounds his own epiphanic understanding over the pain of his subjects and the issues they stir up. It causes him to seem rather guileless. The point of the kind of identity politics that Adria Richards gestures at is not to be ad hominem, as Ronson accuses her of being, but to recognize that different identities produce vastly different experiences and ways of being treated by others. And we come to understand these different experiences and their unique hardships not by simulating them, minstrellike, but by honestly reckoning with the testimony of others.", "I wish that Ronson had also considered why demanding that someone is fired from his or her job has become so central to the public shaming ritual. This demand, I think, reveals several things. First, it reflects how we are all public figures now and all have brands or reputations to protect, and so do our erstwhile employers. We have ported the logic of the celebrity shame cycle\u2014in which corporate sponsors are expected to drop the offender posthaste\u2014to the workaday world. It\u2019s a strange conflation of the public and private, of believing that individuals are always-on representatives of their employers and that an incensed public is in a position to decide when this association should end.", "The second thing that these calls for firing reveal is how precious a job has become and how truly punitive public shaming can be. We know that it\u2019s increasingly difficult to get a full-time job and losing one means having to fall back on a threadbare social safety net. Add to that the threat of a permanent Google trail (a feature that Ronson does a good job exploring), and being fired as a result of bringing disrepute on yourself or your employer can be a quick trip to precarity. Do shamers realize the jobless purgatory they might send their targets to? Has that become the singular marker of a \u201csuccessful\u201d shaming campaign?", "About right. I don't think people who enjoy the idea of getting strangers fired over tweets really understand the dystopia they're creating for themselves.", "", "-testostyrannical", "", "", "", "Finally, the effort to get people fired reveals one important driver of public shaming\u2014namely, a declining faith in the efficacy of American institutions. The public\u2019s mindset seems to be: No one will punish these people, so we have to do it ourselves. The parallels with the justice system and traditional notions of mob justice are obvious, and it\u2019s one of Ronson\u2019s smarter moves to visit a prison psychiatrist and a former judge who specialized in handing down embarrassing punishments. Yet when he tells the judge, Ted Poe, who\u2019s now a", "of the House of Representatives, that \u201cwe [public shamers] are", "\u201d (emphasis in original), Ronson suffers from the public shamer\u2019s lack of proportion.

Being able to partially access this bit of the original language felt particularly relevant in reading these books, in which Elena\u2019s own life is often influenced by the distinctions between Neapolitan dialect and Italian.

Lila sees \u201cdissolving boundaries\u201d most often in the men with whom she has painful and unequal relationships: an unwanted suitor, a bad husband, a difficult brother. The boundaries between her and Elena are also imprecise, but in a way that is ultimately a solace and a prod to both women: \u201cIt was good just to see each other every so often to hear the mad sound of the brain of one echo in the mad sound of the brain of the other.\u201d The relationship where you love someone and yet they drive you crazy, a relationship that leaves you feeling doubled and blurred: This is, I\u2019ve realized, also the kind of feeling you find between mothers and daughters.", "For the fear of becoming your parent is one way this kind of blurring happens. The fear of passing on undesirable traits to your children is another. Both are vivid to Elena, but over the six decades covered by the books, they change in a way that also feels true. For example, Elena is appalled as a child by the notion that she might develop a limp like her mother. Later, when her mother comes to care for her during an illness, she sees the limp differently: \u201cI felt the energy she gave off, and I thought that her lameness had required her to have greater strength than normal, in order to survive.\u201d And when she does develop a limp, she eventually comes to see it as an agreeable distinguishing trait.", "For my mom and me\u2014who, like all mothers and daughters, sometimes have a difficult relationship\u2014the novels have given us a way to stay in closer touch and a subject to return to and discuss. My mother\u2019s slow translation has worked so well in part because the books are so precise about how reading and writing can ease the seam between two people, or even inside one person. After a trying encounter with Lila, Elena tells us that \u201cWhat finally restored me to myself\u2014but what myself?\u2014was the proofs of the book: a hundred and thirty-nine pages, thick paper, the words of the notebook, fixed by my handwriting, which had become pleasantly alien thanks to the printed characters.\u201d That book, and the other boundaries that work in these books, are like ligaments connecting bones: a thing that joins two solid objects, but which permits them to move separately, and which has enough give to allow for unforeseen changes. The joy of reading these volumes is that you find them not only in the stories, but in the world, and in the echo between them.", "---", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Austen shows that her heroine\u2019s worst behavior and attitudes go against her better nature, which is convivial and loving. Soon, one of Austen\u2019s greatest comic creations will arrive in Highbury: Mrs. Elton (the new wife of the aforementioned vicar), who besides being deliciously awful, will further press this case by presenting Emma with a cautionary reflection of her own snobbery\u2014all while supplying Austen\u2019s readers with endless amusement.", "Comedy always imposes some distance. Austen is not obliged to take her heroine terribly seriously, and the perennial question of whom she will marry feels less than passionately urgent.

A man\u2019s facial hair is an ambiguous stylistic feature\u2014it registers both as a natural occurrence and a personal choice\u2014and because shaving is now encoded as the cultural default among the Western white men who see themselves as the standard-bearers, a man who rocks a beard makes a statement. The bearded man represents \u201cmale dignity in an age of increasing gender equity,\u201d Oldstone-Moore writes. \u201cThere is often talk of expressing one\u2019s authentic self.\u201d", "That\u2019s an old line. Early beard theorists charted scientific links between facial hair and the very essence of manliness.

(The history of beards could also be seen as a history of men making irrational arguments to prove their superior faculties of reason.) These guys also believed that semen was stored inside the head, that it drained to the face when a man assumed a missionary sexual position, and that it bloomed, when fertilized with a generous serving of vital heat, into a beard. By 1603, Italian philosopher Marco Antonio Olmo had figured out where semen comes from, but he floated a more psychic connection between chin and crotch, calling facial hair the outward-facing manifestation of a man\u2019s \u201cgenital spirits.\u201d (The \u201c", "\u201d movement, which encourages November mustache growth to raise awareness of prostate and testicular cancer, is a modern callback.) Centuries later, the bearded, balding Charles Darwin would again affirm the sexual potency of the beard, claiming that male facial hair emerged as an evolutionarily advantageous ornament for attracting women. Freudians agreed: Beards were the dicks of the face.", "But they were also the windows to the soul. Though Charlemagne was a mustache guy, he was often depicted in art with a curled white beard, even contemporaneously. The artistic license, Oldstone-Moore writes, was made with an effort at telling \u201cthe story of his soul\u201d rather than reflecting his physical reality.\u00a0 (Centuries later, the coining of \u201c", "\u201d would winkingly recall the association.) Other creative artistic depictions of facial hair reflected changes in the Zeitgeist: Jesus Christ was first depicted as a smooth-cheeked cherub in the style of an ancient Greek hero or god, and only sprouted his iconic beard centuries later when religious leaders called up a scruffy Son of God to emphasize the primacy of gender roles, even in the afterlife. Members of some religious sects even shaved their faces in the hopes of focusing their efforts on cultivating what they called \u201cthe inner beard.\u201d The man who stroked his beard in thought was perceived as accessing his very essence.", "Photo by Matthew J Cline", "Beard theory had political uses as well. As Oldstone-Moore notes, \u201cphilosophers were history\u2019s first pro-beard lobby,\u201d and they fought off the influence of clean-shaven clergy or feminist women by crafting theories that hinged on their hairlines.

Artists measure their work against that of other artists, and critics (often reputed to care too much about the aesthetic horse race) also judge art by the standard of life.

Self-importance is the enemy of significance, and no one can be more painfully aware of this paradox than a critic, which explains why", "is such a curiously flitting book. Scott begins with a bold assertion (\u201ccriticism, far from being a minor, petty, secondary art, is in fact larger than the others\u201d) and then dances back into self-deprecation and disclaimers. Recalling his youthful stabs at poetry and fiction, he blames his inability to write the sort of idea-driven work he aspired to on \u201cshallowness, maybe. Lack of nerve.

(The films of Leni Riefenstahl serve as the perfect example here.) This approach, while legitimate, is also inevitably reductive, because no one really wants to see art diminished to propaganda for correct ideas and behavior.

A little later, the father is quoted as having said, \u201cIf it were possible to compete in martyrdom/ your mother would do everything to lose.\u201d On top of everything else that line does, it uses \u201cmartyr\u201d in the more careless, figurative sense of someone long-suffering and overly dramatic, free for a moment from thoughts of the violent identity they fear their white neighbors will confer on them. On the very next page, the father\u2019s line about the brother appears: he \u201csaw the terrorist\u2019s face in the mirror.\u201d It\u2019s one of hundreds of small reminders of the ways the family members slip between insider and outsider in Sweden, decades after their arrival there.", "About halfway through", "shortly after the unattributed comment about the past\u2019s ongoing assault, the family members begin turning outward.

He didn\u2019t subscribe to punk\u2019s no-history/no-future manifestos, and his stage name and glasses (providing a \u201c", "in reverse\u201d effect) were given to him by his manager; he went along cheerfully because that was showbiz.", "At the start he was more adult than his years, and his peers, working a straight suburban job (data entry at an Elizabeth Arden lipstick factory) to support a wife and infant son. It was only success that brought a regression, one that he\u2019d voiced premonitions about in", ": \u201cWhen they told me \u2019bout my side of the bargain, I knew that I would not refuse/ And I won\u2019t get any older, now the angels wanna wear my red shoes.\u201d He comments now: \u201cI had barely received a hint of encouragement from the world outside, but knew that there was a jealousy and malevolence to the pursuit of fame that would not allow you to get any older once the deal was struck.\u201d", "Likewise, when he wrote \u201c", ",\u201d he was sounding \u201cmy fear that I would not be faithful or that my disbelief in happy endings would lead me to kill the love I had longed for.\u201d (His first wife, Mary, was someone he\u2019d fallen for from afar back in high school.) That pessimism about family came from his father\u2019s own trespasses against Costello\u2019s mother, which seem to have been serial and flagrant. In this way, too, Costello would turn out to be a chip off the old block. Or maybe it was just an occupational hazard. Like his boy, Ross was himself the only son of an itinerant musician, an orphaned military and later ocean-liner bandsman. In the book he writes, \u201c[My] Dad and I had also the capacity for selfish cruelties that the solitary child can think routine and acceptable.\u201d", "Those cruelties were visited particularly on Mary, whom Costello cheated on promiscuously while he and the Attractions stormed Britain and America in a haze of booze and pills in his brief, early \u201cpop star\u201d years. The book circles again and again to his regrets about his actions, though discreetly and sometimes obliquely\u2014the way he handled such matters in many of his lyrics, in which he often transposed pronouns and mixed carnal and romantic imagery with politics and commerce, for the sake of art but also for a touch of obfuscation. As he writes, this was pop music, not the confessional.", "One of the book\u2019s most wrenching moments comes a quarter-century later, when Mary came to see Costello perform for the first time in decades. He was employing his colorful invention, the Spectacular Spinning Songbook, a wheel of fortune full of song titles that audience volunteers would spin to determine the setlist, a way of keeping the performances fresh. That evening, though, \u201cthe contraption delivered eight songs in a row that detailed how our life together fell apart\u2014the songs I wrote when I betrayed her, and really broke both of our hearts. It\u2019s hard to describe the mortification that I felt that night.\u201d", "Nevertheless, inevitably the most exciting sections of the book, though they\u2019re also the most-previously-rehearsed, are those chapters that chronicle the early Attractions years, with an intensity of both life and art such that every month was packed with incident. The momentum came to a crash, however, late one infamous night in March 1979, when Costello was drinking with members of the Stephen Stills band in Columbus, Ohio. He was winding them up by slandering American music, culminating by dismissing Ray Charles and James Brown in vile racist terms (including the N-word), which set off a fistfight. The next day his arm was in a sling and his still-obscure name all over the press. The tour meant to make his career in America sabotaged it instead.", "He deals head on with Columbus here, although he avoids repeating his statements (which, to be fair, he can\u2019t remember saying). He disavows having any hidden racist sentiments, and while no white person should deny that infection so stridently, the evidence of his life and art, before and after, mostly justifies him. Costello doesn\u2019t mention it, but his father wrote a letter to", "objecting to his son being characterized as a racist, saying that his own background as an Ulster Catholic led him to despise intolerance and his son was raised the same way.", "I think the explanation, beyond a blind-drunk relish for provocation at any cost, is more in the young Costello\u2019s insular Britishness. The American version of racial tension was abstract to him, so he did not grasp the depths of the obscenities he was uttering, however facetiously. (For a much deeper analysis of the incident and its reverberations, as well as Costello\u2019s music in general, read", "in the", ".)", "What surprises me here is not his self-defense\u2014which he is careful to balance by saying, \u201cThere are no excuses\u201d\u2014but that he still feels hounded and haunted by that night. Whenever he meets someone new, he writes, he wonders if they know and are thinking ill of him. Thirty-five years is a long time to carry even a self-inflicted wound.", "Yet he also says that night might have \u201csaved my sorry life.\u201d There\u2019s no telling where his excesses were leading, especially if amplified by further fame and fortune. He\u2019s grateful for the \u201cmore interesting\u201d life that resulted from \u201cthis failure to get into some undeserved and potentially fatal orbit.\u201d Costello didn\u2019t actually stop drinking for another couple of decades, but he does not discuss that here, so thankfully it does not turn into a rehab-and-redemption memoir. The book\u2019s asynchronous structure permits him to omit what he pleases, without the gaps becoming obvious. If he avoids much mention of his 16-year second marriage, to Cait O\u2019Riordan of the Pogues, whether from enmity or respect, that\u2019s fine with me. But the way he handles one other controversy bears scrutiny.", "In Chapter 13, the one actually titled \u201cUnfaithful Music,\u201d he says that of everything people have said about his music, the most \u201cbewildering\u201d charge to him is misogyny. He points out, I think rightly, that many of the songs marshaled in those accusations, such as \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model\u201d and \u201cParty Girl,\u201d are depictions and critiques of misogyny instead. He claims people are projecting \u00a0or \u201cjust weren\u2019t listening very hard.\u201d", "He partly blames an early quote from an interview in which he hyperbolically (and drunkenly) said that all his songs were motivated by \u201crevenge and guilt,\u201d which the press never let go. And he even says that because of the gap between his front teeth, everything he sang tended to come out with an unintentional hiss. \u201cIf everything you say sounds like the beginning of an argument, it is easy for someone to miss the joke and look for the smart remark, where only the heartfelt word is written.\u201d", "While it\u2019s true the \u201cangry\u201d Costello was a caricature, it was one in which he was complicit. (Showbiz, again.) More so, many of his songs", "argumentative, which is one of their virtues\u2014unlike a lot of more impressionistic musicians, he has a restless and tenacious mind that likes to pull subjects apart and reassemble them askew. (Contra David Lee Roth, critics don\u2019t love Elvis Costello so much because he", "but because he thinks like them.)", "And his subjects, especially on his early albums, often involved gender roles and sexual tension\u2014the way that both sides of an amorous exchange objectify, exploit, and commodify each other and weaponize sex for status. He often views sociopolitical problems through a sexual lens as well and always from the masculine side. It all certainly enhanced his art. He shouldn\u2019t be called out more than other male musicians because he confronted these dynamics rather than being oblivious to them. But neither should he expect total absolution.", "If I seem to be dwelling on select aspects of the book here, making it seem less lighthearted than it really is, it\u2019s because most reviews and interviews about", "have bypassed the charge of its title and dwelt on the easier bits: his explanations of certain songs, his evocations of family and showbiz history, and all the musicians he\u2019s admired and/or worked with. The last third of the book is heavy on that last element, so maybe it looms largest in reviewers\u2019 impressions afterwards.", "Costello is indeed a great raconteur, and the book is a cornucopia of witty anecdotes and musical insights. I particularly relished learning that one of my favorite \u201cminor\u201d songs of his, the 1980 bonus track \u201c", "\u201d", "dated from years earlier and was actually a turning point in his writing: He borrowed from", "the notion of simply toasting a mundane spot, an art-deco vacuum factory he saw each day on his way to work in data entry, but then added his own rejoinder, \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of life or death \u2026 Who cares? Who cares?\u201d\u2014the first time a shrug, the second time a real question. He says the song took him \u201cthrough the door to a different, less ingratiating way of speaking.\u201d", "As a huge fan of his two-season in-depth musical talk show,", ", I also relished those scenes from backstage. But in more than 600 pages, charming stories, celebrity cameos, and creative exegesis become exhausting without some unifying themes, and Costello is chary about them.

(Her father, a shipbuilder, was also self-educated, having taught himself to read.) After getting an M.A. in French, she worked as an independent scholar, publishing books on Renaissance history and culture while caring for her ailing parents, until she found an intellectual home at the Warburg Institute, an interdisciplinary research institution loosely affiliated with the University College. \u201cWarburgian history,\u201d as Yates called it, sought to transcend nationalism by emphasizing pan-European ideas and culture. This unifying dream was exactly what Yates needed, in her head and in her heart.

In researching Bruno\u2014a renegade Dominican monk, metaphysician, and memory expert who was burned alive in 1600 in the Campo de\u2019 Fiori in Rome\u2014Yates recalled seeing other instances of sophisticated memory techniques mentioned in medieval and early Renaissance texts. Surely they were connected?", "culminates with Bruno, who took the memory arts to their limits, but it also follows the roots of the memory palace all the way back to the Greek poet Simonides, who first developed the idea of using spatial imagination to retain information. Simonides had just left a dinner party in a stately home when the roof collapsed, crushing all the remaining guests beyond recognition. Because he could recall where each person was sitting when he left, Simonides was able to identify all of their corpses, and in that recognized the mnemonic power to be found in conjuring mental images of space.", "A memory palace, or \u201cmethod of loci,\u201d was at first mainly used to memorize speeches (the most important part of a Greek or Roman citizen\u2019s public life). To make one, you picture a multiroomed building (it\u2019s easiest if it\u2019s somewhere familiar, like your family home), and place symbols of each point you want to make in each room. If you want to start out talking about crop yields, you might imagine bags of grain in the foyer, then a fierce bandit in the next room if you want to move on from there to declaim on law and order. Typically, though, the symbols used were strange and striking, weird allegorical and pagan figures filled with hidden meanings that overflowed into the art of late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Yates argues that such devices as the Seven Deadly Sins and the structure of hell, purgatory, and heaven in Dante\u2019s", "are mnemonic icons and systems that had become infused with mystical import.", "Very skilled practitioners of such methods can use them to remember astounding amounts of information\u2014and do so to this day, as Joshua Foer recounts in his 2011 book", ", about his foray into the world of competitive memorization. But as the centuries passed, the art of memory became more than just a tool for many of its practitioners. Yates writes of Giulio Camillo\u2019s \u201cmemory theater,\u201d a concept that expressed the metaphysical and supernatural beliefs with which the memory arts had become saturated during the Middle Ages. Instead of moving through the architectural space of a palace, in the memory theater, the \u201caudience,\u201d which consists of one person, stands still in the exact center. The viewer looks out upon a tiered auditorium of rigidly ordered symbols and cues designed to call forth absolutely everything he has ever known\u2014and perhaps even more. (You can see a video of a 3-D rendering of Camillo\u2019s theater", ".) To master such complete memory device would be to approach divinity.", "Camillo, Yates writes, \u201cwas one of those people whom their contemporaries regard with awe as having vast potentialities.\u201d And, like most people of this type, he accomplished very little and was largely forgotten (until the publication of", "). It is his idea for a physical manifestation of the human brain at its most advanced that fascinates the narrator of Critchley\u2019s Memory Theater. The narrator actually builds one of these structures, which sounds daft until you learn that Camillo did, too, or at least a model of one. (He refused to divulge its true workings to anyone but the king of France, his patron.) The model, never finished, was big enough to fit two people and was \u201cmarked with many images and full of little boxes,\u201d according to one first-hand observer. The narrator of Critchley\u2019s Memory Theater may not have a royal patron, but he does manage to complete his auditorium, which is just big enough to squeeze in one man and contains everything he knows about philosophy.", "What drives him to this project are several boxes of documents he discovers while cleaning out an old academic office. These turn out to have belonged to his dead mentor, and one contains a sheaf of charts in the form of concentric circles pierced by irregularly spaced lines radiating out like spokes. While they look like birth charts (his mentor was that rare philosopher with a keen interest in astrology), they are in fact the opposite. Each chart is devoted to a particular philosopher and is filled with tiny inscriptions listing such life events as publications, weddings, and the birth of children. To his astonishment, the narrator realizes that some of these charts accurately record events that happened after his mentor\u2019s death. His mentor, therefore, had somehow devised a means of calculating the future. At the center of each chart is a circle in which the time, date, location, and cause of death is noted for each subject, some of the dates having yet to occur. And then the narrator finds his own chart.", "After an interlude of denial and bland hedonism, the narrator finally throws over a great job in New York City and moves to a Podunk town in the Netherlands where he devotes himself to building his memory theater in preparation for the fateful hour. The plan, he explains, is \u201cat the instant of my death, I would have recalled the totality of my knowledge. At the moment of termination, I would have become God-like, transfigured, radiant, perfectly self-sufficient, alpha and omega.\u201d", "As demented as this sounds, it is not so very far from the contemporary notion of uploading one\u2019s mind into the cloud. We are often most unreasonable when we pursue the extremes of rationality, when we decide that knowing everything will allow us to be anything we want and that with our technology we can defy death itself. This was a major theme in Frances Yates\u2019 work: that the Renaissance we once viewed as a repudiation of medieval superstition in favor of reason and humanism was in fact shot through with magical beliefs that continued well into the scientific revolution. (Isaac Newton, after all, practiced alchemy and attempted to decode the date of creation from the Bible.) One reason the history of the art of memory had been nearly lost was because humanist scholars like Erasmus, who hated the Middle Ages, believed that such practices, as Yates put it, \u201cbelonged to the ages of barbarism,\u201d and ought to give way to the age of books.", "Yates, if she was anything at all, was a child of the age of books, and the mother of at least two great ones.", ", despite being a work of great erudition spanning several languages, cultures, and historical periods, has a marvelous fluid clarity rare in contemporary histories written at the same scholarly level. Yates describes Bruno and Camillo as if they were people she\u2019d just missed meeting but had heard a lot about, friends of her parents, say. Her empathy for their spiritual yearning animates the book without ever trumping her rigor. And above all, she conveys the excitement of intellectual discovery and deduction, as she carefully unearths the strands of a strange, unbroken tradition lying concealed beneath the conventional story of Western civilization\u2019s stately procession toward the triumph of the Enlightenment.", "Although she is best known for unearthing this long history of the art of memory, Yates never actually learned to perform any of its techniques herself. Instead she plowed forward, reading and writing more and more books and articles. By the time of her death she had buried her beloved brother, both her parents, and two talented sisters who had been the companions of her later years. If she had chosen instead to look back, chances are she would have seen only loss and that mysteriously tragic \u201cevent\u201d of her youth. For someone with her gloomy disposition, this might have seemed too great a risk.

It was this love of correspondence that started Thorpe down the path that eventually led to the criminal courts at the Old Bailey, where he found himself charged with conspiracy and incitement to murder in 1974.", "Back in 1960, when Princess Margaret, the queen\u2019s sister, announced her engagement to Anthony Armstrong-Jones, Thorpe had dashed off an arch postcard to his friend Brecht Van de Vater. \u201cWhat a pity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI rather hoped to marry one and seduce the other.\u201d When the card reached Van de Vater, he proudly showed it off to his handsome 19-year-old live-in assistant Norman Josiffe, along with 30 or so other letters from Thorpe, many written on House of Commons stationery. Later, the high-strung Josiffe grabbed the cache of correspondence and bolted from the house. A few weeks later, when he found himself homeless and directionless after a nervous breakdown, he went to Westminster to see Thorpe, who took him on an overnight visit to his mother\u2019s house\u2014called Stonewalls, ironically enough. After a peculiar formal dinner where the only food served was boiled eggs, Josiffe retired to his room, where Thorpe later buggered him. The next day, Thorpe told Josiffe where he could find a room to rent in London and gave him \u00a310. For some time afterward, they continued their sexual relationship.", "Fortunately, the hit men Jeremy Thorpe\u2019s friends engaged were utterly incompetent.", "Preston does a thorough job of following Josiffe\u2014who later changed his name to Norman Scott\u2014through a long string of fresh starts and disappointments. A pattern emerges of a delicate, damaged man who is forever walking away from the kinds of jobs\u2014usually working with horses, occasionally as a model\u2014that were available to men with no education, a history of mental illness, and a minor criminal record. Josiffe/Scott was clearly charming and attractive, because every time he stormed off, he always seemed to find someone willing to take him in. From Thorpe\u2019s point of view, though, Scott was a ticking time bomb, because everywhere he went, he told people\u2014his benefactors, priests, and even policemen\u2014about his sexual relationship with the man who by 1967 had become the leader of the Liberal Party. Thorpe was all too aware that Scott\u2019s meager possessions included a cache of his letters, now including a vaguely affectionate note sent by Thorpe to Scott that contained the line\u2014later subjected to rigorous public literary scrutiny\u2014\u201cBunnies can (and will) go to France.\u201d", "It was these letters\u2014and Scott\u2019s habit of blabbing about Thorpe to anyone who would listen\u2014that kept Scott on Thorpe\u2019s radar. Finally, after years of attempting to help himself by helping Scott\u2014making introductions, encouraging him to emigrate, having Bessell pay him a regular stipend\u2014Thorpe made the fateful decision to have Scott killed.

Nevertheless, the book\u2019s final third, in which Scott is further victimized by the legal system, makes for depressing reading. Preston refrains from editorializing, but it\u2019s impossible not to be appalled by the ambient homophobia of the period. Gay and bisexual men like Scott and Thorpe lived under daily threat of prosecution, were shut out of employment and subject to blackmail, could be denied entry into the United States, and were routinely described as filthy and depraved. Even after decriminalization in 1966, effeminate men like Scott were treated with contempt by the authorities, dismissed as hysterical and warped, and generally thought to be untrustworthy.

Now that we can see the baked-in biases of the time as well as the evidence, there\u2019s no doubt the verdict was a grave miscarriage of justice.", "In the midst of this awfulness, Preston\u2019s account of the fight to decriminalize male homosexuality in Britain is especially enjoyable. In this story the hero is Lord Arran, the quirky peer who moved the bill in the House of Lords. On the rare occasions that the eighth earl, Boofy to his friends, had previously spoken in the House, it was to advocate for the rights of badgers. He and his wife, a champion powerboat racer, allowed badgers to roam freely in their home in Hemel Hempstead, \u201cand always wore gumboots indoors to stop their ankles from being bitten.\u201d Nevertheless, Arran was driven by the memory of his gay elder brother, who had committed suicide days after succeeding to the title.

This dovetailed with another observation: My students are not as puzzled by Stein as I expect them to be. Stein writes: \u201cGlazed Glitter.

Instead, she combined her love of modernism and education to become a pioneer in the emerging field of children\u2019s literature.", "Brown and Stein\u2019s sympathies both have their roots at Radcliffe College. Stein went to Radcliffe and studied with William James. One of her classmates there, a fellow student of James\u2019, was Lucy Sprague Mitchell. Where Stein took James\u2019 lessons to Paris, Mitchell took them to New York, where she applied them to the task of educating children, founding the Bank Street school of education. In 1935, Margaret Wise Brown entered the school, originally as a teacher in training, but, by 1937, she had become a writer.", "Born in 1910, Brown was the second of three children in a conventional, upper-middle-class family. Her nursery had a gas grate with decorative tiles depicting the three little bears and the cow jumping over the moon. The young Brown had a menagerie, including many rabbits. When one died, she skinned it, kept the fur, and announced that she was going to be a lady butcher when she grew up.", "Brown went to Hollins College, a women\u2019s college in Virginia, where she discovered Proust, Woolf, and Stein. After graduation, she moved to Greenwich Village and enrolled in a fiction workshop at Columbia University.

A friend encouraged her to apply to Bank Street, and there she found a community inspired by the relevance of modern ideas to early childhood education: welcoming immigrants and students of all faiths, emphasizing a pragmatic \u201chere and now\u201d curriculum that takes the child\u2019s experience and perspective as its foundation, and embracing the value of a hands-on acquaintance with science and the arts. Even so, Brown\u2019s start was rocky. Deeply interested in the individual child, she was indifferent to classroom management. One progress report notes that she \u201cseemed to contribute a somewhat disorganizing influence to the class.\u201d Most damningly, she left the art closet messy, \u201cwith two pots of glue spilled.\u201d", "While Brown struggled in the classroom, she excelled in Lucy Sprague Mitchell\u2019s language class. Mitchell recognized that a modern education called for new books. She also saw that she was not the person to write them. In keeping with Bank Street\u2019s emphasis on the here and now, Mitchell wanted children to read about the sights and sounds of their own world, unadorned with fantasy. She joked, in fact, that she was introducing the \u201cspinach school\u201d to children\u2019s literature. In Brown, she found the writer who could make her ideas palatable.", "Brown continued writing for both adults and children, but it was a children\u2019s story that made her a paid author. When her first royalty check came, she cashed it, hailed a horse-drawn flower cart, bought every flower on it, and called her friends over for a party. By the fall of 1937, Brown was meeting regularly with Mitchell and others, forming the Bank Street Writers Laboratory.", "Soon thereafter, she met the painter Clement Hurd, just back from studying with Fernand L\u00e9ger in Paris.

United in admiration for Stein, and attracted to Hurd\u2019s paintings, Brown invited him to show his work at Bank Street. Hurd watched while the children looked at his art\u2014a process as terrifying as any studio critique. When the teacher congratulated him on holding the children\u2019s attention for five full minutes, his career as an illustrator of children\u2019s books began.", "At this time, Brown was also on staff at William Scott\u2019s new publishing house, W.R.

She wrote spare, idiosyncratic, unsettling fiction, tinged with a hectic misanthropy, about misfits, oddballs, and the chronically overlooked.

A small, steady following for her work persisted over the next five decades, keeping her books in print and awaiting favorable conditions for a revival. A new biography,", "by the critic Ruth Franklin, represents the latest and most concerted attempt to reclaim the writer\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s also a fresh effort to frame her as an artist with extraordinary insight into the lives, the concerns, and\u2014above all\u2014the fears of women. Franklin doesn\u2019t attempt to portray Jackson as a feminist. The F-word seldom appears in Shirley Jackson, although Franklin makes frequent reference to Betty Friedan\u2019s", ", a book that does capture some of the confusion and dissatisfaction of Jackson\u2019s life and work. The iconography of 20", "-century literary feminism rests uneasily on Jackson\u2019s shoulders. She was tragic, but obscurely so. Unlike Sylvia Plath, she wasn\u2019t tormented to her doom (or not exactly) by a dastardly husband, and unlike both Plath and Joan Didion, Jackson\u2014plain, overweight, wearing a shapeless housedress when she even went out at all\u2014made a cosmetically unappealing role model for the sort of young literary women who, being young, care about appearances more than they like to let on.", "Besides, no one could ever quite get a bead on Shirley Jackson. She was, as Franklin writes, \u201can important writer who happened to be\u2014and to embrace being\u2014a housewife, as women of her generation were all but required to do.\u201d (Jackson was born in 1916.) She wrote disturbing fiction that gave some of her readers nightmares, and she also wrote", "about raising the four children she had with her husband, the literary critic Stanley Edgar Hyman. (Franklin writes that Jackson \u201cessentially invented the form that has become the modern-day \u2018mommy blog.\u2019 \u201d) Far from discouraging her, Hyman considered Jackson a genius and berated her for not spending more of her time writing\u2014although granted, this was partly because they always needed the money. For much of their marriage, she outearned him.", "Jackson\u2019s contemporaries found the contrast between her fiction and nonfiction\u2014the eerie and the cheery\u2014baffling. Just as perplexing to the present-day devotee of her stories and novels is the marked contrast between Jackson\u2019s life at the center of a boisterous bohemian family and the fragile, isolated characters she invented. The daughter of a highly conventional California socialite who never ceased to voice her disappointment in her daughter, Jackson rebelled comprehensively: by marrying a Jew, by taking few pains with her grooming, by keeping a messy house, by telling the world all about it. Yet she was never able to shake her mother\u2019s influence, dutifully writing to her parents and submitting her life for their disapproval throughout her entire adulthood. One of the most poignant documents in Franklin\u2019s book is a letter Jackson wrote to her mother after she received glowing coverage for", "in", ", only to have her mother focus entirely on the unflattering photograph the magazine used. \u201cSurely at my age,\u201d Jackson retorted, \u201cI have a right to live as I please, and I have just had enough of the unending comments on my appearance and faults.\u201d She never mustered the nerve to send it.", "Jackson, at the peak of her powers, was about to embark on a new phase of her career and perhaps her life.", "Jackson met Hyman when they were both students at Syracuse University; he announced he would marry her, sight unseen, after reading a story she published in a campus journal. The young couple scraped by in Greenwich Village for a few years, then Hyman got a job as a staff writer for the", ". He remained on a retainer at the magazine for the rest of his life, but in the 1950s the family moved to Vermont, where Hyman joined the faculty of the progressive women\u2019s college Bennington College. A charismatic talker and dedicated mentor, Hyman taught what was for many years the university\u2019s most popular course \u201cMyth, Ritual, and Literature.\u201d He was Jackson\u2019s first reader (the pair edited each other\u2019s work) and a top-notch literary champion. One of the couple\u2019s closest friends, the novelist Ralph Ellison, wrote much of his own masterpiece,", ", in the Hymans\u2019 rambling old Vermont house, Hyman\u2019s relentless encouragement spurring the often-blocked Ellison on. Jackson was a gifted, adventurous cook. They threw famous parties, whose guests included such luminaries as Dylan Thomas, the poet Howard Nemerov, and Bernard Malamud.", "But Hyman was also chronically unfaithful to Jackson, flatly refusing to make even a pretense of monogamy, no matter how much misery this caused his wife. And his criticism often tormented Jackson, much as her mother\u2019s did, a bitter irony when she\u2019d picked him, in part, for the ways he seemed her parents\u2019 opposite. When, in the years leading up to her sudden death by heart attack in 1965, Jackson seriously contemplated leaving her marriage, she accused Hyman of subjecting her to \u201cmockery.\u201d Franklin does not establish the themes of his criticism, beyond her haphazard writing regimen and the disorder of her work area, but this was apparently a big problem. One of Franklin\u2019s discoveries is the correspondence with a fan, a fellow housewife in Baltimore, that Jackson kept up in the early 1960s (while she was writing", "). A cache of Jackson\u2019s letters turned up in the woman\u2019s attic after her death in 2013. In one, Jackson reported that Hyman refused even to enter her office because her bookshelves weren\u2019t alphabetized.", "Alan Chin", "The novel Jackson was working on when she died,", ", is narrated by a middle-age woman whose husband has just died under unclear circumstances. She sells everything they owned and moves to another city under a new name, Angela Motorman. (Jackson, Franklin observes, considered driving the epitome of freedom.) She hangs out a shingle as medium, which provides that whiff of the occult that had long been associated with Jackson\u2019s fiction\u2014but her jaunty, enterprising self-confidence sets her apart from all of Jackson\u2019s other heroines. Franklin believes that Jackson, at the peak of her powers, was about to embark on a new phase of her career and perhaps her life. In her final diary, she wrote of her longing \u201cto be separate, to be alone, to stand and walk alone, not to be different and weak and helpless and degraded \u2026 and shut out. Not shut out, shutting out.\u201d", "This does sound very much like the cry of a later generation of feminists, women who left stifling conventional marriages to find themselves. Franklin writes that Jackson\u2019s \u201cpreoccupation with the roles that women play at home and the forces that conspire to keep them there was entirely of a piece with her cultural moment, the decade of the 1950s, when the simmering brew of women\u2019s dissatisfaction finally came close to boiling over, triggering the second wave to the feminist movement.\u201d But Jackson both does and doesn\u2019t fit this mold. Far from interfering with her creative work, her family actually depended on it. And Jackson genuinely enjoyed running a household and raising her children. It\u2019s conceivable that, if she had lived to see the rise of second-wave feminism, she would have found it uncongenial or irrelevant.", "And yet, Jackson\u2019s unhappiness was tied to her gender. Hers are novels of identity, like", ", a work that shares many of the same undercurrents. Both Jackson and Ellison wrote about wrestling with roles imposed not just by a white male-dominated society, but also by people who share one\u2019s assigned identity. In Jackson\u2019s stories and novels, other women are always the strictest enforcers of correct feminine behavior, a phenomenon she experienced firsthand from childhood. In an early draft of", ", quoted in Shirley Jackson, a character remarks, when her sister urges her to get married, \u201cPerhaps she found the married state so excruciatingly disagreeable herself that it was the only thing bad enough she could think of to do to me.\u201d To belong requires miserable compliance; if you refuse, you will be \u201cshut out,\u201d and miserable in a different way.", "The tension infusing this unbearable choice fills Jackson\u2019s fiction with doubles and imposters, selves distributed among multiple characters, and in the novel", ", a heroine with multiple personalities. The uncanniness in her novels and stories derives from a sensation that people who feel unfree to be themselves are haunted by the selves that cannot be. (Henry James, a profound influence on Jackson\u2019s scenarios, although certainly not on her prose, once wrote a story in which the narrator is pursued by the ghost of the man he would have been had he lived his life differently.) The vertiginous, diffuse terror Jackson so excelled at inspiring comes from the sense that her characters don\u2019t even really know who they are. This is distinct from Franklin\u2019s understanding of the occult in Jackson\u2019s work as \u201ca metaphor of female power and men\u2019s fear of it,\u201d which implies that the fear is merely external. You don\u2019t have to be a woman to be subjected to the psychic pressure that leads to such fracturing, but if you are a woman (or, in Ellison\u2019s case, black, or James\u2019 case a deeply closeted homosexual), you are far more likely to be.", "I first learned of Jackson back in 1989 as a ninth grader reading her short story Charles.", "", "", "", "", "It wasn\u2019t feminist critics who kept the flame of Jackson\u2019s reputation lit over the past half-century, but genre writers. Since 2007, the", "have recognized \u201cthe legacy of Shirley Jackson\u2019s writing,\u201d by singling out works of \u201coutstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror, and the dark fantastic.\u201d Stephen King, in the 1981 collection", ", pronounced", "on par with James\u2019", ". But this association with horror led many critics, in Jackson\u2019s day and since, to treat her work, patronizingly, as a vehicle for chills. (One critic made Hyman apoplectic by describing Jackson as \u201ca kind of Virginia Werewoolf among the s\u00e9ance-fiction writers,\u201d as if anyone who could produce a line like that were in a position to rule on another writer\u2019s \u201cseriousness.\u201d) Just as there is no reason why a novel by a woman should be any less significant than a novel by a man, there is no reason why a story with a ghost in it should be automatically deemed more frivolous than a coming-of-age yarn.

There are more rippling ellipses, more unanswered messages.

The whole setup seems weirdly, almost creepily, de-eroticized, and Witt navigates her ambivalence about it with fascinating honesty and deftness. The piece culminates, perhaps inevitably, with her own experience with the practice, under the detached ministrations of one of the organization\u2019s blandly handsome personnel.

In the same diary, De Quincey wrote of icily shutting down the conversational forays of a couple of older gentlemen he\u2019d once found good company; the dolts failed to appreciate the revolutionary importance of his idols. While he was sulking and fantasizing, De Quincey was also carefully crafting a fan letter to Wordsworth, the first stage in an ambitious plan to become the poet's friend, much as later generations of kids would turn up on Kurt Cobain\u2019s doorstep.", "Wilson, who wrote an award-winning biography of Dorothy Wordsworth (the poet\u2019s sister), makes De Quincey a character so immediate you half expect him to materialize.

To the true Romantic, this heady society became the subject of intense fascination. Every idealized literary scene that has followed it, from the Bloomsbury Group to the Beats, has been, consciously or unconsciously, modeled after it. As soon as the teenage De Quincey learned that his heroes had congregated in the Lake District, he resolved to go there and insinuate himself into their ranks. That\u2019s where he was heading when he ran away from school in 1802, but he lost his nerve and headed to London instead, thinking he could live on borrowings against an eventual inheritance. He was wrong about that, and De Quincey spent the better part of a year living on the streets, befriending the young prostitute he describes so heartrendingly in", "Or did he?

Novels, on the other hand, work better when the central characters are closer to average, when we can see our own lot reflected in theirs. Memoirs fall somewhere in between, which is also where De Quincey dwells. Certainly, he was an influential writer, well-thought-of by his peers. But when De Quincey wormed his way into the life of William Wordsworth, he found himself surrounded by bona fide geniuses: not just Wordsworth himself and Coleridge, but also the great essayist William Hazlitt.

Throughout much of this period, Coleridge stayed with the Wordsworths while his wife and children lived in another house in the area. Then he fell madly in love with Wordsworth\u2019s sister-in-law, an unruly passion that would eventually drive the poor woman to the brink of a nervous breakdown. Coleridge himself was an opium addict, which made him just about the worst houseguest of all time. He slept all day and woke up the household in the middle of the night, to the disgust of the sober Wordsworth. While De Quincey was still making himself agreeable in Grasmere, many in the circle, Wilson speculates, imagined that he might marry Dorothy Wordsworth. Instead he became infatuated with a poor, barely educated farmer\u2019s daughter, got her pregnant, and did the right thing by marrying her.

As a child, I could easily overlook this; to an adult reader, the restraint multiples the novel\u2019s power: \u201cI came to the mound where my ancestors had sometimes camped in the summer,\u201d Karana relates after the rescue ship finally arrives. \u201cI thought of them and of the happy times spent in my house on the headland, of my canoe lying unfinished beside the trail. I thought of many things, but stronger was the wish to be where people lived, to hear their voices and their laughter.\u201d", "O\u2019Dell was 60 when he wrote", "a veteran of the early film industry, in which he worked as a cameraman, and the newspaper business. He thought like a reporter, working, as Sara Schwebel\u2019s introduction to the new reader\u2019s edition details, from multiple primary and secondary sources on the Lone Woman and the indigenous peoples of the Channel Islands. He also ran early drafts of the novel past friends involved in the nascent academic discipline of anthropology. But next to nothing is known about the Nicole\u00f1os. The Lone Woman\u2019s neighbors and relatives dispersed into the general population of California, and anyone who recalled their language, history, or beliefs did not write any of it down. O\u2019Dell combined legends and customs from nearby peoples on the Channel Islands and the mainland, and he describes some of the region\u2019s artifacts, like the pitch-lined baskets used to carry water, in careful detail. Other details, like the islanders\u2019 use of two names\u2014a public one for strangers and a true one for trusted intimates\u2014he simply made up.", "Inevitably in the five-and-a-half decades since", "was published, questions about the legitimacy of a white man writing from the point of view of a Native American woman have cropped up, but no one\u2019s ever really made such criticism stick. An essay, \u201cA Counterstory of Native American Persistence\u201d by Carole Goldberg, included in this new edition, labels the novel a \u201cvanishing Indian\u201d narrative, a story of \u201cthe extinction or complete assimilation of the peoples who occupied North America before Europeans invaded,\u201d and treats such disappearances as a sad, sentimental inevitability. But to support this view, Goldberg has to lean heavily on O\u2019Dell\u2019s brief author\u2019s note, in which he reports that the Lone Woman\u2019s people \u201chad long since disappeared\u201d by the time she reached Mission Santa Barbara. The novel itself, narrated by Karana, ends with her boarding the ship she hopes will reunite her with her family and former neighbors, looking forward to a new life, with Rontu\u2019s pup by her side.", "On the other hand, the notion, cherished by many educators, that", "represents an advance for diversity in children\u2019s literature also seems like a species of wishful thinking.

She notes that O\u2019Dell, writing during the peak of the Cold War, played up the role of Russian colonialism in the depredation of the island and the massacre of Karana\u2019s fellow villagers. But she misses a far more significant parallel in the dilemma the islanders face after the Russian-led trappers slaughter most of the village\u2019s able-bodied men. The old man who takes charge proclaims that \u201cthe women, who were never asked to do more than stay at home, cook food, and make clothing, now must take the place of the men and face the dangers which abound beyond the village.\u201d As a result, Karana pointedly reports, the women work so hard that the village \u201cfared better than when the hunting was done by men.\u201d The remaining men, predictably, take exception to this, complaining \u201cthat the women had taken the tasks that were rightfully theirs and now that they had become hunters the men looked down on them.\u201d", "has often been celebrated for its portrayal of a strong female character, but no one, that I can find, has noted the marked parallels between this part of Karana\u2019s story and American life during and just after World War II.", "In a way,", "also anticipates the post-apocalyptic narratives that are a staple of publishing for young readers today.

Its value had nothing to do with the lessons on cultural representation and feminism it supposedly imparts, just as the pathos I find in Karana\u2019s story as an adult transcends any vanishing Indian clich\u00e9; it is entirely particular to her because her experience, the Lone Woman\u2019s experience, is so extraordinary.

The narrator is the mixed-race daughter of a fiercely self-educated Jamaican mother and an unambitious white dad. Her boss is a \u201cridiculous Iranian called Bahram, very tall and thin, who considered himself, despite his surroundings, to be a man of quality.\u201d He swans around with a long coat draped over his shoulders \u201clike an Italian baron\u201d and treats the narrator warmly until he realizes that she\u2019s not, in fact, Persian herself.

Kelly, unlike Fox\u2019s other primetime hosts, Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity, has done her best to cloud her real agenda; no one at the conservative network in its two decades of existence has managed to \u201cbreak out\u201d in similar fashion.

She is admirably upfront, for example, about her ability to manage men. \u201cMy legal training gave me several skills, but knowing how to handle men in positions of authority was easily one of the most valuable,\u201d she writes in the first of several passages on this theme.", "", "Thanks to her dedication, Kelly managed to land a gig in local television news. A year later, she had her fateful meeting with Ailes, and her career at Fox began. The Fox sections of the book\u2014she started there in 2004\u2014are the most compelling, partially because Kelly\u2019s rise at the network was so impressive, and partially because she describes people such as Ailes and Brit Hume in ways that are often vivid. (After rumors of an affair between Kelly and Hume spread, \u201cBrit was strutting around the office, proud as a peacock!\u201d)", "In the age of Trump and Cosby, Kelly\u2019s run-ins with Ailes were comparably mild, but they are still disturbing and grotesque, and the passages about them are resonant thanks to the acutely believable portrait she paints of Ailes\u2019 character and personality. \u201cI would be called into Roger\u2019s office,\u201d she writes, and \u201che would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me\u2014veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the \u2018very sexy bras\u2019 I must have and how he\u2019d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\u201d Kelly not only managed to avoid him, but also told investigators and the Murdoch family about his behavior, and offered support for colleagues who also claimed to have been mistreated. Kelly\u2019s steadfastness was admirable, and so is the honest avowal she makes at the end of her chapter about the ordeal: \u201cI built my own power. And when the allegations about Ailes hit, I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that.\u201d", "But the problem of what Kelly \u201cuses\u201d that power for remains.

Kelly attempts to differentiate herself from other offenders at her network later in the book when she notes that she has the \u201cmost successful news show in all of cable (O\u2019Reilly\u2019s is an opinion program).\u201d One of the most memorable Kelly", "occurred after Michelle Obama gave a speech that mentioned America\u2019s history of racism.

That\u2019s what we are turning into.\u201d This is the real Megyn Kelly experience.", "The Trump sections of the book are the most disturbing, and in them Kelly\u2019s tough-as-nails truth-telling side comes out, or at least it keeps threatening to, before she reverts to form. She details Trump\u2019s attempts to influence her, first threatening to \u201cunleash\u201d his Twitter account on her (which he did anyway) and then somehow discovering that she was going to challenge him at the beginning of the Republican debate.

Ailes may have been a television genius, but the major lesson he imparted\u2014to know your audience\u2014is a simple one that the Murdoch family is unlikely to discard.

{"Body": ["Maddie Edgar", "According to cannibalism researcher Bill Schutt, the idea of people eating people is always lurking somewhere in the collective Western id, one of those tops-all taboos that manages to revolt and captivate in equal measure. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s more horrifying a concept than incest, bestiality, ritual dismemberment, and that thing called coprophilia where people are really into poop. Our collective push-pull response to cannibalism explains our fascination with Jeffrey Dahmer, Schutt says, and also why Hannibal Lector is considered one of the greatest screen villains in movie history. We can\u2019t look away, even when we want to.", "Now Schutt\u2019s new book,", ", which explores the practice across the animal kingdom, argues that we can actually learn a lot from observing any species that sometimes eats its own kind\u2014including our own. Cannibalism has much to teach us about evolution, disease, racism, and even familial sacrifice and love. And it also, unsurprisingly, makes for delectable reading.", "Schutt, a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History, writes that the scientific community\u2019s understanding of cannibalism in the animal kingdom has changed in recent decades. Once thought of as aberrant behavior in response to extreme situations involving starvation or captivity, cannibalism is now understood to be a characteristic that varies from freakish to downright common depending on the species. It serves \u201ca variety of functions,\u201d Schutt writes, and there are even \u201cexamples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.\u201d Spadefoot toad tadpoles eat other tadpoles. Some snail mothers lay two sets of eggs\u2014one intended to hatch and the other intended to be eaten by those who hatch. (Schutt calls these \u201ckids\u2019 meals.\u201d) Cichlid fish that practice mouthbrooding, in which the parents protect their eggs and babies from predators by carrying them around inside their mouths, sometimes get hungry and swallow their own children. Whoops! In what Schutt calls \u201can extreme act of parental care,\u201d black lace-weaver spider moms call their hungry babies over and allow their children to eat them alive.", "Among invertebrates, there are rules of thumb: Females cannibalize more often than males; the old and young are the first to go. And the practice continues further up the food chain, as well, though in mammals it\u2019s less common.", "\u201cCannibalism occurs in every class of vertebrates, from fish to mammals,\u201d Schutt writes. Rabbit, mouse, and hedgehog moms sometimes eat their young when there\u2019s too many in a litter for the food available or when babies are born dead or deformed. Among chimpanzees, our closest relatives, adults of both sexes have been known to kill and eat babies unrelated to them in response to hunger, dwindling resources, and even, perhaps, a desire for sex. (Jane Goodall observed that chimpanzee moms whose babies were killed and eaten by adults from another community were \u201clikely to come into oestrus within a month or so\u201d and would then be available for \u201crecruitment.\u201d)", "My favorite section deals with the preposterous and rococo cannibalism that is part of the sexual practices of redback spiders.", "Schutt\u2019s chapters on cannibalism among humans are the most fascinating, though it\u2019s a tough subject to study systematically. Human don\u2019t exist in the wild; cultural beliefs get in the way of us expressing behavior that might or might not come naturally to us. And it\u2019s hard to know how far back our cultural taboos related to human-eating go; if ancient peoples were devouring one another\u2019s livers with a nice Chianti, they weren\u2019t writing it down. Schutt traces the cannibalism-is-bad concept through Western literature and fairy tales; in the latter, he writes, child-chomping ogres sometimes served as the ultimate morality police\u2014behave or be eaten. He explores cannibalism as an act of last resort in a disturbing chapter about the ill-fated Donner Party, titled \u201cThe Worst Party Ever.\u201d", "But, as Schutt points out, we are discriminating about what we call cannibalism. Historical claims about savages eating one another are sometimes wildly hyperbolic, or lacking in proof, Schutt finds. Accusations are often undergirded by racism and opportunism. When Spain was exploring and exploiting the Caribbean during the 1500s, a 1510 papal decree that Christians were morally justified in punishing cannibals meant that on \u201cislands where no cannibalism had been reported previously, man-eating was suddenly determined to be a popular practice.\u201d Yet Renaissance-era Europeans who would have been disgusted by reports of people-eating rituals in faraway places nonetheless practiced what Schutt called medicinal cannibalism. \u201cUpper-class types and even members of the British Royalty \u2018applied, drank or wore\u2019 concoctions prepared from human body parts,\u201d Schutt writes. And blood was consumed to treat epilepsy:", "Schutt suggests that this cultural myopia is the reason we don\u2019t label as cannibalism, say, the contemporary fringe practice of moms eating their placentas after giving birth. The tissue is \u201cderived from the fetus,\u201d after all. Schutt travels to Texas to take up a home schooling mom of 10 on an offer to eat her placenta. Fried in a saut\u00e9 pan with garlic and onion, Claire\u2019s placenta looks like liver, chews like veal, and tastes like chicken gizzard.", "So what does cannibalism look like in a culture that doesn\u2019t attach as much stigma to it? Like many other peoples, the Chinese practiced survival cannibalism during wars and famines; an imperial edict in 205 B.C. even made it permissible for \u201cstarving Chinese\u201d to exchange \u201cone another\u2019s children, so that they could be consumed by non-relatives.\u201d But, according to historical sources cited by Schutt, the Chinese also practiced \u201clearned cannibalism.\u201d In Chinese books written during Europe\u2019s Middle Ages, human flesh was occasionally cited as an exotic delicacy. In times of great hunger or when a relative was sick, children would sometimes cut off their flesh and prepare it in a soup for their elders. One researcher found \u201c766 documented cases of filial piety\u201d spanning more than 2,000 years. \u201cThe most commonly consumed body part was the thigh, followed by the upper arm;\u201d the eyeball was banned by edict in 1261.", "This is dark stuff to contemplate, which may be why my favorite portion of the book deals with the preposterous and rococo cannibalism that takes place as part of the sexual practices of redback spiders. Schutt\u2019s wry tone is well-suited to this scientific retelling, and I found myself reading portions of the book aloud to my husband (although I might have enjoyed it more because it\u2019s not the female who has her innards chewed out).", "Basically, among redback spiders, the female is five times as large as the male, which contributes to a certain power imbalance. The male approaches, with perhaps not as much trepidation as might be called for, and tries to get the attention of his lady lover by bouncing around and waving his legs. Courtship continues with some \u201cabdominal vibration\u201d and some \u201cepigynal scraping\u201d and something called \u201cGerhardt\u2019s position 3\u201d (it sounds complicated, but there are step-by-step illustrations if you want to try it), and all of this is followed by the male performing a slow somersault in the middle of copulation. At this point the female vomits on the male and consumes his abdomen as they mate. He walks away, comes back for more (fool!), and as they resume copulation, she resumes eating him\u2014\u201ceventually snorking up his now enzyme-liquefied innards like a spider-flavored Slurpee.\u201d", "Why does the male bother? There appears to be an evolutionary advantage. Scientists have found that cannibalized males \u201ccopulated longer and fathered more offspring than non-cannibalized males.\u201d So there\u2019s that.

Knowledge, to her, is the convergence of thought, emotion, imagination, and memory: something fuller and deeper than what lies at the end of a train of intellectual reasoning.

As searching and seductive as the essays occasionally can be, they are also absolutely maddening. For someone convinced that the truth is not just apprehended by the intellect but also felt, remembered, and imagined, Hustvedt makes little effort to welcome readers with her prose. \u201cRather than charting correspondences between two distinct realms, psyche and soma, we can look for meanings in a lived body that is socio-psycho-biological, with each hyphenated segment mingled into the others, rather than neatly stratified,\u201d she writes. I can tell you what those words mean, but I don\u2019t know if I agree with them: They conjure no answering echo in my history or emotions, and I can\u2019t animate them with the deeper understanding Hustvedt celebrates.", "The thing is: It is also difficult to imagine experts finding her rehashings of other people\u2019s work particularly enlightening. I fear that either her editors stopped reading after a few hundred pages or didn\u2019t want to say anything about her twistier sentences because they anticipated being sneered at. Still, windiness I can forgive. Obscurity I can forgive. More off-putting is the author\u2019s preening self-regard. To read all 500 or so pages of this volume front to back is to be critically radicalized, such that mild marginalia in the first half intensifies into furious exclamation points and scribbled insults in the second half, and by Part III the reviewer is in a constant struggle to collect herself and appreciate the various smart points this extremely vexing person is making.", "Hustvedt will take every opportunity to congratulate herself on her cleverness, as when, searching for a personal example of how morality can\u2019t be easily reduced to mental processes, she describes eviscerating some poor speaker\u2019s \u201csimplistic\u201d paper at a conference. (\u201cI experienced mingled feelings of triumph and guilt,\u201d she recalls, \u201ctriumph because my barbs had been on point and guilt because I had clearly flustered and embarrassed the man.\u201d) I lost count of the number of times she quotes her own work, name-drops famous friends, relays compliments she\u2019s received, or draws our attention to the idiocy of some rival.

Take the essay \u201cMuch Ado About Hairdos.\u201d \u201cAll mammals have hair,\u201d Hustvedt begins in a characteristic rehearsal of the obvious, making a show of seeing the familiar anew. \u201cHair is not a body part so much as a lifeless extension of a body.

There are two side-by-side panels near the end of the ordeal: one of the slave crying and the other a frame of Dana\u2019s face crying as reckons with what she\u2019s seen. It made me think of the complacency the present affords us with regard to the past.

Using a format that combines a playlike assemblage of voices alternating with chapters composed of quotations from historical sources, it depicts how the ghosts respond to the arrival of Willie Lincoln, the president\u2019s son, who died of typhoid at age 11. Lincoln himself appears, the night after his son\u2019s funeral, pulling the dead boy\u2019s body out of its coffin to embrace it. This causes a sensation in the cemetery because, as one of the spirits puts it, \u201cto be touched so lovingly, so fondly, as if one were still \u2026 worthy of affection and respect?

The longer the ghosts remain, the more diminished they become, reduced to tiny forms symbolic of the desires they can\u2019t relinquish.", "The bardo is an element of Tibetan Buddhism, a way station between incarnations in which souls prepare themselves for their next life. The novel\u2019s title, and the role of attachment in detaining the spirits in their limbolike semi-existence, suggests an underlying Buddhist cosmology. But one of the ghosts, a former reverend, claims to have glimpsed beyond this world a place of terrible judgment and punishment, so it\u2019s possible that Saunders means the afterlife to be a reflection of whatever the individual soul expects to see. One thing is certain: The ghosts of children who tarry in the cemetery are in great peril, subject to a horrific transformation in which they become encased in a carapace of tiny, teeming, angry souls (a scenario with an unsettling resemblance to the body thetans of Scientology doctrine).", "Why this should be the case, nobody knows. Jaded readers may suspect that Saunders needed to contrive a selfless cause\u2014saving Willie\u2014to unite all the ghosts in a group effort, thereby providing a plot and the opportunity for redemption in community.

They have made the same errors of perception again and again,\u201d writes Chait.", "is his attempt to correct this error. To show progressives that their pessimism and fatalism is unfounded, and to show that\u2014", "their view of the present\u2014Obama was a success. A huge one. \u201cObama presented a new vision of America, to the world and to itself. And he had, to a degree hardly anybody recognized at the time, made his vision of a new America real,\u201d writes Chait. But here\u2019s where the problems begin. It\u2019s not that Chait doesn\u2019t have a point\u2014although, this point may have been stronger had Hillary Clinton prevailed in the presidential contest\u2014but that he overcorrects, understating the real political and policy failures that marked Obama\u2019s tenure. He fails to tackle the more sophisticated critiques of the administration, from both the left and the right, typically aiming his counterarguments at Obama\u2019s weakest critics instead.", "And so, on the recession and housing crash, Chait spends his time dueling with tendentious and partisan opponents like Amity Shlaes and Charles Krauthammer\u2014who slammed any stimulus as unnecessary and harmful\u2014rather than critics like journalist David Dayen, who", "that the administration dropped the ball on housing relief in a way that prolonged economic pain, undermined the recovery, and contributed to the discontent that nearly derailed Obama\u2019s presidency at several points, and may yet derail his legacy.", "You could lodge a similar complaint about Chait\u2019s own treatment of heath care reform in this book. For as much as the Affordable Care Act has been a success\u2014and Chait details all the ways that is true\u2014he gives short shift to glaring problems like inadequate subsidies (premiums and deductibles are still too high for many millions of Americans) and the absence of actual universal coverage. Chait is correct to argue that all major social programs are inadequate at the start (Social Security was threadbare and designed to appease Southern segregationists in the Roosevelt coalition), but that doesn\u2019t erase the impact of what that means in the moment for actual people.", "This gets to the general problem with triumphalist narratives, and Chait\u2019s brand of triumphalism in particular. A teleological framing of history tends to discount what it actually means to live through and experience setbacks. The eight-year administration of Ulysses S. Grant saw genuine progress for black Americans. They secured voting rights and won federal protection from racist vigilantes; they elected leaders to the House and Senate, and built thriving communities for themselves. This was dismantled in fairly swift fashion by a backlash of conservative politics and while vigilantism. One way to look at this is to say that, in the long run, Grant\u2019s legacy\u2014and that of those black Americans\u2014survived. The story since that period has been one of slow progress built on those gains and experiences. But the other way to describe it is as a long twilight, where black Americans struggled under the weight of oppression until circumstances and events allowed them to recover and reassert earlier gains. Yes, there was progress, but at the cost of generations of pain and suffering.", "Chait\u2019s triumphalism, his teleological view of American history, discounts what it means to experience that twilight. Put in more concrete terms, the fact that Obama\u2019s accomplishments will likely endure\u2014the fact that Donald Trump cannot blot them from the record\u2014will not console the Americans who see family deported, who see children killed by unaccountable police officers, who see the richest Americans siphoning the nation\u2019s wealth for themselves.

Which is to say it suffers from the same overconfidence that led those same liberals\u2014Obama included\u2014to discount the threat of Donald Trump. Committed to a teleology of progress, albeit open to the reality of historical irony, this liberalism lacks a visceral sense of the tragic. That sense of tragedy\u2014that sense that those inevitable reversals engender real pain for real people\u2014is vital. It puts confidence in its proper context, revealing that\u2014even if we are right about the direction of the world\u2014we cannot forget the suffering that comes in those \u201czigs\u201d and \u201czags\u201d of history.

We decorated a small plastic tree and exchanged wrapped gifts. It was the first time either of us had ever done the Christmas thing. We are newlyweds, so we were excited about trying something new together. Neither of us felt less Muslim while hanging ornaments and opening presents, but I was haunted by the thought of it breaking my mother\u2019s heart. She never allowed her children to say the words \u201cmerry Christmas\u201d around her.", "This all sounds minor, and it is, but it ties into the way I feel whenever news breaks of a terrorist assault on a church in the name of Islam. I understand how alien and unfriendly Christianity can feel to young Muslims. When an entire generation of Muslims is getting inundated with anti-Muslim imagery while being taught only rules and not given the tools to actually study and interpret the Quran, it leaves many young Muslims vulnerable to terrorist groups with evil political goals. This is an uncomfortable truth mostly deflected within Muslim communities. It\u2019s easy to say that monsters don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t represent us, but what are Muslims doing to protect their children from radicalism?", "tackles this question over the course of a series of essays framed as letters from Ghobash, a diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, to his young son. Early on in his book, Ghobash opens up about his dawning realization that he wasn\u2019t the only one guiding his son\u2019s spiritual education; his son\u2019s Arabic and religious studies teachers were influencing him, too. Ghobash watched his son\u2019s behavior change as he became more interested in a strict interpretation of Islam. It scared Ghobash so much that it inspired this series of letters\u2014his attempt to steer his son\u2019s understanding of what can make a Muslim vulnerable in today\u2019s political climate. These letters are also a crash course in Islamic history and modern Middle Eastern politics. Ghobash vividly unpacks the effects that the intense negative media imagery associated with Islam can have on a young Muslim. His son, he writes, had become focused on trying to identify who the \u201cgood\u201d Muslims were, and he began distancing himself from anyone he deemed to be not religious enough.", "For me, reading this hit close to home. During my own Islamic upbringing in the United States, my mother was determined to raise her four children as proper Muslims outside of Egypt, where she was born. We were enrolled in one of those strict private Muslim schools in Jersey City, New Jersey: the kind with separate entrances for boys and girls. \u201cWhen two people of opposite genders are alone, they are joined by devil\u201d was more a mandate for us than poetic spiritual guidance. That\u2019s just one of the many rules that distinguished us Muslims from everyone else. So when I later enrolled in a public school only a week after 9/11, I kept away from girls entirely.", "I imposed the same rules on myself not because I was super religious, but because that\u2019s what I thought being a practicing Muslim was about. I was lazy about praying the five daily prayers, but I felt that eating pork would violate my entire identity. At first I was cautious around my new non-Muslim classmates, but that changed almost immediately. I was the first Muslim any of them had ever met and their friendliness and acceptance challenged my perception of non-Muslims writ large. Watching the news taught me that Americans hated Muslims; why did these students think my religion was cool? They sometimes had silly questions like whether or not I lived in a pyramid or what exactly were women hiding underneath their hijabs, but I made better friends there than I ever had in Islamic school.", "In his book, Ghobash is pushing for personal accountability. In his letters, he repeats a theme that is reassuring, if opposite to my experience of the way Islam is taught: There is no one correct interpretation and there never will be, so it\u2019s OK to be uncertain about your beliefs. He presents Islam as an open-ended journey that can lead you down any path of your making. In one of the letters, he tells his son: \u201cSaif, I want you to be aware of the well-constructed path to a closed worldview that will, if followed, lead a person to a dangerous place. It can lead a well-meaning and sincere child to a place of close-minded anger and aggression.\u201d He goes on to say what took me a very long time to learn: \u201cEvery young Muslim should demand his or her right to discover the world for himself or herself, using the tools of self-knowledge and self-mastery.\u201d Ghobash also writes that it\u2019s much easier to reject ideals you don\u2019t agree with than it is to work to understand the other side. Whether or not terrorists practice Islam the way we believe it should be practiced, they read the same books we read and are using propaganda to reach out to our children.", "Part of what makes these topics so difficult for Muslims to contemplate is that we are constantly defending our religion in the West. With politicians digging for dirt on the global Muslim population in order to justify their own bigotry, there are arguably many issues for Muslims to consider before we are critical of our own communities. I know many Muslims who have been victims of targeted hate and violence. How can we risk fueling the very hate we feel we need to defend ourselves against?", "Ghobash recommends against carrying the weight of guilt for atrocities committed by others in the name of God, and instead tries to push for understanding of how bad people continue to use our God for evil. He writes: \u201cIt is too easy to say that [terrorists] have nothing to do with us. They speak in Allah\u2019s name. And they do so convincingly. Even if their reading seems warped and out-of-date, it is a reading. It is a reading that has traction, that has popularity. We must react in some way. We must take action.\u201d And his book is an invaluable start to a crucial conversation the global Muslim community needs to have about the violent fringes within our faith\u2014precisely because Ghobash\u2019s personal relationship with his son generally takes precedence over universal exhortations.", "The book doesn\u2019t really try to make arguments. Ghobash encourages a search for nuance in a world consumed with a polarizing, partisan us-versus-them mentality. This is not another exhausting", "about why Muslims deserve sympathy.

He repeatedly refers to these letters as a \u201cspiritual guide\u201d for his son after he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m not a father, so while reading this I projected my own parents into the role of Ghobash addressing his son. It made me reflect on the many challenges that come with raising Muslim children in the West. How did my parents protect us from hate until we were old enough to understand it? How in the world did two Egyptian immigrants pull off raising four Muslim children in America?

But I wish so much that anyone who self-identifies as anti-Islam would read these letters, too. It\u2019s an incredible guide for anyone hoping to understand the nuanced relationship between extremists and the other 99.9 percent of peaceful Muslims around the world. Ghobash patiently unpacks the kinds of questions Muslims tend to avoid asking to avoid appearing disloyal to their communities or questioning God\u2019s authority. It wasn\u2019t until adulthood that I myself became comfortable asking tough questions about, for instance, Islam\u2019s relationship to homosexuality, apostasy, and abortion. Many Muslims believe the Quran to be a timeless text that can be interpreted to apply to any moment in history. This book is a plea for Muslims to return to the interpretive drawing board, to try and re-understand their religion in the modern world.", "My life has changed so much since my high school years, the dawn of my intellectual relationship with Islam, that it feels strange to look back on that time now. I have a diverse group of friends that include Muslims and non-Muslims. My wife and I have nightly debates that challenge the fundamentals of our faith. God plays a much larger role in my life, while my identity has shifted away from being singularly Islamic. But I know one thing: I wish I\u2019d been able to read essays like these earlier on.

I can be cool in criticism, and I can be right, which is a great joy, whereas in fiction you can only be variously vulnerable. There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect novel, and you\u2019ll always look the fool in some proportion, and also you\u2019ll always reveal yourself in a way that is kind of horrifying.

This has been, Mishra claims, \u201ca massive and underappreciated shift worldwide.\u201d The modern individual is encouraged to aspire to the wealth, status, fame, and power on constant display via mass media, even when getting all of that means jettisoning other, older sources of meaning, leaving the places where their families have lived for generations and loosening once-sacred ties. More often than not, they will learn that the rewards of this system are reserved for a few, that the economic expansion of the past 200 years was more of a fluke than an abiding condition, and that emerging economies will never reap as much as the economies that got there first.

The other is that the malaise of modernity afflicts even the privileged because the promise itself is hollow.

(Rousseau\u2019s notion of the ideal society was Sparta.)", "Mishra doesn\u2019t endorse this exasperating philosopher\u2019s vision, but he regards Rousseau\u2019s ability to anticipate \u201cthe moral and spiritual implications of the rise of an international commercial society\u201d as prescient.

Apart from Rousseau and a few other major figures such as Nietzsche, Mishra writes, he has chosen to focus on \u201crelatively neglected German, Russian, and Italian thinkers, whose eclectic ideas infused other frustrated latecomers to modernity with a messianic sense of destiny.\u201d (He opens the book with the Italian poet Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio who, in 1919, with the aid of a couple thousand followers, took over the town of Fiume for more than a year, establishing a proto-fascist \u201cfree state\u201d and inventing the stiff-arm salute now associated with the Nazis.)

Wallace made it his business to be the kind of writer for whom no one section of the bookstore could be a natural home. And so a book like this, as minor an entry as it is in the DFW oeuvre, is representative of his work precisely because of how incongruous it seems. He wrote brilliantly about what he knew, of course\u2014tennis, addiction, television, the self-devouring solipsism of a particular kind of heterosexual maleness\u2014but some of his best essay writing and journalism resulted from putting himself in situations in which he was absurdly, perspiringly out of place (porno award ceremonies, luxury cruises, lobster festivals, so forth).", "is characterized by a similar dislocation of author and subject, but it never achieves the exquisite style or penetrating insight of those later intellectual excursions.

The self-conscious didacticism and performative equivocation are there, as is the uneasy synthesis of sincerity and irony, but the prose seems too often just compulsively wordy, the voice too awkwardly enamored of its own academic-vernacular register.

Throughout, Wallace and Costello are just far too engrossed in the apparent incongruity of their own enjoyment\u2014as \u201ctwo highbrow upscale whites\u201d\u2014of a genre which is \u201cvery self-consciously, music", "urban blacks", "same", "and", "same.\u201d", "Twenty-four years on, rap is still a largely African-American art form, but the presence of white participants in and commentators on rap culture is no longer remarkable.

There\u2019s a scrupulous, sometimes comic self-consciousness to the Us and Them divide that runs through the book, but this doesn\u2019t mitigate its failure to transcend that divide. (This problem is sometimes aggravated by a tendency to view rap as speaking for urban black communities as a whole\u2014as \u201csynecdochic,\u201d in Wallace\u2019s term.)", "Wallace and Costello were writing at the tail end of the \u201980s, at a time when hip-hop\u2019s position in pop culture was just starting to become truly major\u2014when Public Enemy, Gang Starr, Eric B. and Rakim, N.W.A., and De La Soul were all asserting their presences in the mainstream. Because the two white guys are implicitly addressing an audience that needs convincing of rap\u2019s seriousness as art, there\u2019s quite a lot of explaining being done here, very little of which now makes for edifying or interesting reading. \u201cThe rapper,\u201d writes Wallace, \u201coffers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight stressed rhymed verse, the verse\u2019s syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket.\u201d The DJ, we are told, \u201cis responsible for the song behind and around the rap\u2013\u2013the backbeat, krush groove, and the \u2018sound carpet,\u2019 i.e. a kind of electric aural environment.\u201d It\u2019s interesting, from the vantage point of 2013, to see exactly who and what Wallace and Costello take seriously, and in what ways. The Beastie Boys are dismissed, several times over, as \u201cexecrable,\u201d \u201cgodawful,\u201d and essentially talentless\u2014an assessment which, on the basis of their pre-1989 output, is understandable if harsh. Public Enemy, as you\u2019d expect, are given much more consideration. Wallace has a riff, for instance, on the line \u201cI show you my gun/ My Uzi weighs a ton,\u201d and, specifically, the fact that Chuck D\u2019s talking here about the weight and firepower of his lyrics, as opposed to any literal weapon. Wallace points out that this is an inversion of the usual way in which, historically, pop lyrics substituted innocuous terms for controversial signifieds\u00a0(where something like \u201cBaby, here is my love\u201d would be an obvious euphemism for \u201cBaby, here is my dick\u201d). Chuck\u2019s Uzi, he argues, serves in the lyrics as \u201cnothing more than a", "\u201d whereby \u201cthe song", "becomes the true deep referent in the meaning-layered lyrics of any music that wishes to enjoy the favors of outrage-hungry pop audience and conservative entertainment industry alike.\u201d", "Photo by N.C. Larson", "Like much of the critical treatment given to rap lyrics in the book, it\u2019s clever, but not much more than that. As an introduction to late \u201980s rap, the whole thing is pretty idiosyncratic all round. Eric B. and Rakim, for instance, are barely given the time of day, while the authors are convinced of\u2014and largely convincing on\u2014Schoolly D\u2019s greatness as a kind of postmodern troubadour. His trash-talk epic \u201cSignifying Rapper\u201d is, Wallace writes, \u201ca new type of cut that opens up Hard rap\u2019s artistic possibilities even further, effecting an historical closure by which this high-tech genre insiders define as \u2018any rhythmic rhymes spoken over a strong beat\u2019 can perform its best-rooted and probably strongest function: storytelling.\u201d", "Of course, as the cover makes clear, Wallace is not the only author of this book. In fact, the layout keeps reminding us that we\u2019re dealing with two distinct authorial presences: Wallace\u2019s sections are headed \u201cD.\u201d and Costello\u2019s \u201cM.\u201d This back and forth is possibly more in the spirit of Chuck and Flavor than, say, Deleuze and Guattari; Wallace\u2019s sections tend to close with explicit segues into Costello\u2019s, often with actual colons, or partial sentences (one section ends with the words \u201cAs in,\u201d a small example of Wallace\u2019s tendency to aestheticize incompletion). Costello\u2019s presence is secondary, although by no means incidental. A lot of the material he covers in his sections draws on his background as a lawyer\u2014there\u2019s a fair amount of discussion of the civil rights movement, on the growing problem of gang violence in Boston, and some mildly interesting stuff on the legal issues around sampling and copyright infringement. There\u2019s also a long disquisition on Jesse Jackson\u2019s claim that he was at MLK\u2019s side when he died, which is interesting on its own terms, but never quite gets around to being relevant.", "The heavy critical lifting, though, is mostly Wallace\u2019s work. Costello\u2019s involvement seems to have grown out of the fact that he happened to be living with Wallace at the time he was writing it. Because of their shared enthusiasm for rap, Wallace asked Costello to read what he was writing, and their conversations on the essay evolved into a kind of informal two-dude symposium. \u201cOn occasions when we did not overlap in the apartment or take a drive together,\u201d says Costello in the preface, \u201cI sometimes wrote my reply to parts of his rap essay. A yeah-but or a what-if, left on his desk. It was Dave\u2019s idea to incorporate my responses and turn the essay into a co-authored book with intercut voices.\u201d", "The idea for the book, Costello says, came out of a panel Wallace was part of. \u201cA fellow panelist launched a rote attack on rap as violent, anti-white, anti-women, bling-obsessed. Dave defended the artists he knew, praising the dexterity, the wordplay, the raucous, raw assault on the sententious Babbittry of the Age of Reagan.\u201d An editor who attended the panel suggested that Wallace write an essay in defense of the form\u2014an essay, says Costello, \u201cthat might have carried the title \u2018How Rap, Which You Hate, Is Not What You Think, And Is Interesting as Hell, and, If Offensive, a Useful Sort of Offensive Given What Is Happening Today.\u2019 \u201d That projected title, for all its familiarly performative loquaciousness, actually gives a pretty succinct idea of what Wallace is up to in the project that eventually became", "The \u201cYou\u201d being addressed is an implied readership of white intellectuals with a sketchy and dismissive view of rap. (A fact which accounts for, but makes no less retrospectively awkward, the spectacle of two white intellectuals lengthily defining terms like \u201cill\u201d and \u201cdef.\u201d) The book, in this sense, is a sort of critical diplomatic mission on behalf of a hip-hop culture Wallace is explicitly doubtful he has any real business speaking about, let alone for. Although it\u2019s sometimes interesting on the experience of being a white fan of a predominantly black art form, there\u2019s a relentless fetishization of rap\u2019s \u201cOtherness,\u201d its difference, its closure against outsiders; and this, eventually, comes to seem like a way of concealing a scarcity of real insight into the music itself.", "But while we\u2019re on the topic of critical self-consciousness, it\u2019s probably a bit obtuse to insist on reading this book as though its arguments about the cultural consequence of late \u201980s hip-hop, and its analysis of the complexities of the white fan experience, were the main grounds on which it should be considered. It is in one sense, as Costello puts it in his preface, \u201ca deeply dorked-out artifact of 1989.\u201d But it\u2019s also an artifact in the ongoing exhibition of Wallace\u2019s intellectual omnivorousness. The book is a failure, but one that can only really be seen within the overall context of a dramatically successful career. \u201cA major impediment to sampling this Scene,\u201d writes Wallace at one point, \u201cis the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself\u2019s changing. I.e., if you\u2019re reading this in print it\u2019s already dated.\u201d\u00a0 This is true now in ways Wallace probably couldn\u2019t have predicted when he wrote it. The cultural landscape of the book\u2019s original significance has receded, and given way to an entirely different context\u2014the magnitude of its co-author\u2019s subsequent achievement.

The book\u2019s road to publication has a few interesting potholes, including the departure of its acquiring editor; in the end, Harper\u2019s Barry Harbaugh, new to book editing, shepherded it to publication. Sicha and Harbaugh discuss the process in this", "author-editor conversation.", "Do you think it is pertinent to begin by explaining how you came to write this book, and why 2009? I read a draft for the first time when Julia Cheiffetz, an editor who used to work here, left for another house, and she had\u2014I think\u2014more or less commissioned whatever you would come up with.", "Julia and I met in her office, when HarperStudio (RIP!) was acquiring books rather \u2026 quickly, and, you know, we had a really delightful conversation about what was going on in the world, and particularly in New York City, and how utterly frightening and real and dark it was and what we could do about that. And the thing is, it's so easy to forget now what that era was like! We immediately all tried to move on, but do you remember? I remember when the consultant came to lay us all off at the magazine I was working at, and how ridiculous he was. And I remember when I emailed Kim France, asking if there was any caption writing work in", "magazine. And I didn't. Even. Hear. Back. So, dark times.", "Yeah, I think everyone in New York has their 2008/09 story. Mine was being laid off from Cond\u00e9 Nast", ". I walked in one morning in April '09 and everyone was drinking whiskey and throwing stuff away! Where were you?", "Haha, let's see, by then my landlord on St. Mark's Place had realized that I'd abandoned my apartment after several months of, let's say, \"withholding rent.\" That was about the same time that I got my very own case officer at the IRS. I hadn't written a word for money in months. So, yes, I sold this book on a conversation and then went out and I found a whole bunch of people, some of whom made it into the book. A long time later, I turned it in a draft, and I think it's fair to her to say that Julia hated it. She couldn't even respond, and when she finally did, she was like \"I don't know what to say!\" And then she left, and the book went into limbo, and then, by some process that I do not know about, you appeared.", "I have no idea what she thought of what you turned in but I can imagine\u2014because I actually went through it myself\u2014her wondering just what the hell you were up to, and whether this was a serious approach or not, this breaking of every rule of narrative nonfiction that I could think of. Part of what was so unusual about that first draft was the voice: the casual knowingness of the tone, the shrugginess (not a word) which seems of a piece with your other writing. To say nothing of the fact that this voice seems to be coming from a not-too-distant apocalypse. What did you expect reactions to be?", "On both a conscious level and less-conscious level, I really wanted to write a book that many people hated. I believe very strongly in nonfiction, but I also love science fiction\u2014in fact, I don't really read anything that isn't sci-fi. For a while I was calling this \"science nonfiction\" which isn't a phrase that really works. OK BUT WAIT. Let's get real. You ended up with the manuscript of a book you didn't commission or buy. And honestly the first draft was more than a bit hairy. I mean, even I knew that; I didn't think draft one (or two, or three?) was like \u2026 perfect. Were you like \"Ugh, this piece of shit, what to do!?\"", "Well, I remember thinking it was messy or something. But I liked that about it. Honestly, I was thrilled to be asked to work on the book, because I knew of your stuff online, and knew that Julia had done something really smart in going out there and getting your signature in blood, and so I think the project after I'd read the draft was trying to parse out what aspects of the casual voice were in pursuit of the story, and not just signs that there was a lot of work to do. But there was a lot of work to do, and you had to sort of rediscover your motivation.", "But Barry. How many books had you actually edited before this one? I will tell you how many books I'd written before: none!", "Ha. Um, that was pretty early in my days at Harper. I was editing under David Hirshey\u2019s guidance/pre-eminence. Some of the first books of my very own were definitely yours and Baratunde Thurston's", ", both of which came from Julia\u2019s keen eye. Usually, nonfiction projects sort of develop under an editor\u2019s feet\u2014we see drafts of chapters and outlines and stuff as we go\u2014but with yours there was this really weird, thrumming manuscript to dive into. And it was so different than the other stuff on my desk. THAT WAS SO LONG AGO.", "OK, so sometimes I got the sense that you were frustrated by 1. the fact that it was nonfiction and relatedly 2. the reporting. Like any good editor, you wanted to know things: \"WHAT COLOR WAS THE SHIRT\" or \"WHAT DID THEY EAT\" or \"WHY WERE THEY EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS\" (LOL), and I was like \"Well, Barry, I don't know.\" And you took that really well (and I went back to notes and tape where I could!), but did it drive you crazy? And my orneriness about not changing a single word of dialogue, that it had to be \"as spoken,\" was that irritating?", "Yeah, there's a ton of backseat driving that's endemic to something so severe and presumptuous as a marked-up manuscript. And most of that first or second edit was just a bunch of questions that were trying\u2014I think\u2014to get you to confront the decisions you were making. Like one thing the book does is subvert the kind of description we're used to. You explain familiar concepts like credit cards and cheese graters as though they're alien to us, and I think it took me awhile to really see the project from your point of view\u2014e.g. that there was a lack of physical description or other narrative detail because you wanted the reader to read through a looking glass. It's funny because you're a very accomplished editor yourself, and this must have been a new role.", "I found edits really painful. Like \u2026 they were impossible to look at. (This is not unusual for writers.) But what happened is I sat with your letters and I figured some things out while listening to you. That sounds wrong! I mean, you told me things, and I got them! It seems relevant to mention that I don't give two fucks about the marketplace, and I just wanted to write a book that a small group of people will perversely cling to. So my point, and I do have one, is that the point of editing is to make a book successful. And \"successful\" can mean a number of different things. I know I didn't make things", "maybe. Or maybe not easy, or not pleasant. But it wasn't supposed to be.", "I am new to book editing\u2014it's been three years now, but only one when we started, and I\u2019d come from the magazine world. But the contents of a book, whether fiction or not, are being sold under the banner of the author\u2019s name and not the publication\u2019s. Because one doesn\u2019t really edit for house style in books, it means that really unusual projects like yours have room to take shape in this organic way. So I just needed to learn what/where you were coming from and what that voice was doing. I just felt like we had to make you happy, because you would make readers happy.", "Heh! I'm so glad I got you while you were still young.", "And we had to have a book. I\u2019m sugar-coating, I guess: The real commercial pressure was that we had a project that was in the air, and someone had to decide what to do.

And then so the books do, too. And then everything sounds the same. Great, I sound unhinged.", "I'd really like", "to send you to a Soviet bloc country.", "That sounds like a threat. Did I pull off being a diva without being a pain in the ass?", "So far. Seriously, I never thought you were a diva.", "I'm so good at hiding my insanity. I wish more writers were. Just STUFF IT DOWN. Yell at your cats. Don't send the first drafts of your emails to editors. DON'T SUBTWEET. It's not that hard. Anyway we need to talk about the time we sat down and read the book out loud, which was horrifying for me!", "Was reading it out loud more or less productive than the editorial passes you dealt with at home alone? What was horrifying?", "Well, I'm easily embarrassed! And so reading it out loud felt so terrible. Which is stupid. (I'm not vain, but I am shy!) So the great part of reading it out loud was that we nuked a thousand terrible sentences. That process really, really, really worked for me. Like saying it out loud just truly exposes the horror of a vomitey sentence. That was just terrific, and I should read more things out loud before publishing them. Also let us not forget that there were two other editorial reviews: that of the characters, and also by the wonderful HarperCollins legal department! The legal department had more inquiries than all the characters combined.", "Some of the pre-pub reviews, like Kirkus, have called the book a hybrid of genre, while others have similarly seemed not to have wanted to believe that this was in fact (as the subtitle states baldly) a work of complete nonfiction, complete with real life characters that had to at least be made aware of what you'd written about them.", "I love that there is confusion about this as a work of nonfiction, particularly because it is so strident in its nonfiction rules. (Like, there are a lot of very, very carefully constructed sentences to convey facts as far as I can convey them.) Jason Kottke presented this really reasonably:", "Does it matter that I can't tell if your book is a novel or non-fiction?", "And also: that came to bear on the revisions. I'm looking again at the first edit memo and I ask you about why we can't give more of a description of the main character's work life. But I thought the same thing! Is this fiction? Can we publish as fiction? Why did I want to do that?", "Maybe we\u2019re being a little coy. Any confusion is our fault.", "\"Entirely Factual\"!", "Well, yes. That is pretty overt. I would like to assert that there are no fiction tricks at all in the book! None! Zero! A friend of mine recently told another friend of mine that there was a composite character in the book. And the other friend was like \"Um well that's me! And nooooope it is not composite, it was me the whole time!\" Isn't that great? Or not.", "I mean, are there composite characters in the book?", "Barry! Of course not. What do you think now will become of this book? You're a gambling kind of man. Let's make this interesting. For reference, on July 8, 2013, on Amazon I was apparently \"No. 3,598 in Books.\" On July 26, I was apparently \"No. 28,691 in Books.\" This is very silly.", "Following David Hirshey's lead, I think it will be a", ".", "Ooh, what an interesting phrase.

Anyway, I think reviews will be all over the map, I pray there will be no scandals, and I thank each and every one of the 1,200 people who will buy it. Fortunately, with 1,200 people, I can thank them individually.", "Do you think they'll care who the characters are?", "Well, it's in people's nature to want to know who people are, I get that. But it's actually not at all a necessary or interesting question. (I don't recall people asking that of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's work, by the way.) The people in the book are just people like you and me, and I think that people who read the book will want to be kind to them. Everyone's privacy is really important to me.

(And even recounting these details, he is seducing her; Aviva is a reader and consumer of narratives.) At worst, it is predatory. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve come to understand that telling someone\u2019s story \u2026 is at one and the same time an act of devotion and an expression of sadism,\u201d he says. \u201c", "are the one moving the bodies around, putting words in their mouths, making them do what you need them to do.\u201d Unlucky with flesh-and-blood Aviva, Bruce relishes his control over hallucinatory Aviva, who also tends to appear when he\u2019s masturbating.

They go on and on, then rest without talking. They daydream for a long time, and then one or the other begins the touching again. The afternoon is endless.

One of the first firms to market maternity clothing was Lane Bryant, launched in 1904 by dressmaker Lena Bryant (the bank misspelled her name when she opened her business account, and it stuck). Bryant\u2019s simple, inexpensive maternity dresses were adjustable, but did not solve the problem of uneven hemlines as the tummy expanded and fashion dictated ever shorter skirts.", "In 1937, Dallas secretary Edna Frankfurt Ravkind was pregnant with her second child and unable to fit into her usual elegant wardrobe.

The baby boom and postwar prosperity transformed consumer buying power and spending habits, making the idea of clothes that would last just a few months palatable.", "In 1940, on a family vacation to Los Angeles, Edna impulsively rented a storefront on Wilshire Boulevard, deeming it the perfect spot for Page Boy\u2019s second boutique. On opening day, actress Margaret Sullavan bought an entire maternity wardrobe. It was the start of a beautiful friendship between Page Boy and Hollywood.

They were early evidence that the cult of personality, which now pervades not just entertainment but politics, business, and pretty much every other aspect of American life, was already in full force. Being a successful star was no longer a matter of simply acting. It was now a far more complex proposition that had as much, if not more, to do with what you wore and said and did off-screen as what you did on it. Actors were accountable not just to their studios but to their fans, who were no longer satisfied with the packaged bios and romances put out by publicity agents.", "Photo by Nina Subin", "In other words, the American public was learning nothing less than how to be \u201cmodern media consumers\u2014to be charmed by movie stars but not overwhelmed by them, to live in the world of celebrity without either turning their back on it or becoming unstrung by the fact that they themselves were not celebrities.\u201d Now, of course, we live in a time when the idea of someone accepting their own failure to be a celebrity seems quaint\u2014the Bravo channel alone is testament to that\u2014but Talbot\u2019s excursion into the ways the world of movies has affected the American psyche sheds considerable light on the origins of the fame-hungry culture we live in today. In addition, it animates the final years of Lyle\u2019s story, which might otherwise read like the rather worn plot of a Hollywood movie in which the handsome young actor never quite lives up to his early promise, nearly drinks himself to ruin, and is saved at the eleventh hour by the love of a good woman.", "The other thing that saves this story is the sheer affection with which it\u2019s told.

What\u2019s surprising, though, is how often those correspondences take forms we mightn\u2019t have expected. Wallace was preoccupied with the ungainly, unfashionable questions of how to live and of how to be moral, and he believed that fiction had to try to provide answers to those questions. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that he himself was often guilty of exactly the kind of (specifically male) moral failures he focused on in, say,", ".", "But it\u2019s still something of a shock to see the extent to which Wallace\u2014the perspiring, softly spoken and tortuously sincere figure of popular affection\u2014could himself be a Hideous Man.

A lot of what he disliked in other people, and much of what concerned him about contemporary culture (polymorphous addiction, shallow self-obsession, ostentatious cleverness, reflexive irony) was a reflection of something that discomfited him in himself. Unlike Updike, Wallace refused to make an artistic virtue out of the necessary evil of his own narcissism; he wanted, in his life and his art, to be a great deal better than he often was.

More often, though, it\u2019s just plain gruesome\u2014and nowhere more than in Max\u2019s detailing of Wallace\u2019s relationship with the poet and novelist Mary Karr, who was married with a teenage son when he met her through a recovery program. He turns up at a pool party Karr is attending with her family, a bandage on his shoulder covering a fresh tattoo of her name. He contacts an ex-con fellow AA member looking to buy a gun to shoot Karr\u2019s husband. He tries to push her from a moving car.

But he\u2019s also very good on the editing process, and on Wallace\u2019s relationships with Gerry Howard at Viking Penguin and Michael Pietsch at Little, Brown (who told Wallace\u2019s agent that he wanted to publish", "\u201cmore than I want to breathe\u201d). You wouldn\u2019t expect the war of editorial attrition over a 1,200-page, footnote-encrusted novel to make for especially gripping reading, but it does. Max\u2019s detailing of the push and pull between Wallace and Pietsch highlights, above all, the contingency of the published text, the extent to which it is a result of countless reinings-in, relinquishments and grudging compromises. His reading of the fiction itself is thoughtful and subtle; although it\u2019s never groundbreaking, it\u2019s never perfunctory either. Max also doesn\u2019t overstretch himself, as literary biographers often do, in pointing out correspondences between the life and the art.", "Max\u2019s focus is, not surprisingly, more or less resolutely on Wallace\u2019s life as it related to his art. This decision to strip the story down to its narrative essentials pays off in terms of compulsive readability, but there are places where you wish he\u2019d peeled away a little less. The problem is most acute when it comes to Wallace\u2019s mother Sally, a professor of English and grammar specialist. Max refers to the story \u201cSuicide as a Sort of Present\u201d as \u201ca meditation on [Wallace\u2019s] difficult relationship with his mother,\u201d but the nature of this difficulty remains largely undefined, and Sally is never more than a hazily peripheral figure.

Wallace himself emerges as such a complex, poignant figure\u2014is so thoroughly brought to life in all his affliction and ambition and dangerousness and decency\u2014that, in the closing pages of the book, I felt, as though for the first time, the terrible magnitude of his loss.

Like how he\u2019d previously prepared to kill himself by tying a garden hose to his car\u2019s exhaust pipe with his bandana (which would have been like Freud somehow committing suicide with his glasses, or Joyce with his walking stick). Or how, during the terrible days of his final illness, his parents moved in with him: \u201cSally Wallace cooked him the meals he had loved as a child\u2014casseroles and pot pies; they watched", ". It was obvious to his family that he was in unendurable pain. Before she left, he thanked her for being his mother.\u201d There may well be readers who can get through sentences like these without having to put down the book and take a few deep breaths, but I\u2019m certainly not one of them.", "Part of this emotional force is due to the relative recentness of Wallace\u2019s death, to the not-yet-fully-dissipated haze of unreality that surrounds the fact of his 2008 suicide. But it also has to do with the way in which a book like this, which reveals for the first time many of the facts of a life of such serious cultural consequence, serves as a kind of public completion of that death, as a final rite in the literary funeral. There is, in other words, a slightly paradoxical effect to", ". In providing a more complete sense of Wallace than we ever had while he lived, it makes his death feel more real, somehow more irrefutable. And, for anyone who felt a profound emotional connection to Wallace and his work, there\u2019s a strenuously cathartic dimension to this: the experience of knowing him more fully, and of thereby feeling more completely the force and finality of his absence.", "---", "by D.T.

Being gay would no longer be something that\u2019s merely tolerated in a liberal state that made room for any kind of freak; LGBT equality would no longer mean the dominant society would hold its nose while granting rights to members of a group it despised. Instead, it would mean embracing gay and transgender people as equally worthy of respect and dignity. \u201cThe gay movement was stuck with two choices,\u201d writes Hirshman about the post-Stonewall era. \u201cThey could ask the society to ignore or tolerate their behavior, immoral or not, in the interests of higher values like freedom or privacy.\u201d Or they could insist that they and their actions", "moral, that, in short, \u201cgay is good.\u201d", "That phrase, \u201cgay is good,\u201d is borrowed from the late Frank Kameny, an indefatigable gay rights crusader who was fired from his government job as an astronomer in the 1950s and who\u2014rare for his time\u2014never seemed to doubt for an instant that he was as good a human soul as any straight person. Whether the rest of the LGBT universe has followed Kameny\u2019s inspiring lead\u2014and whether having that \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d as Hirshman calls it, is responsible for carving a path to full equality and to \u201cchanging America for everyone\u201d\u2014remains in question, even after completing this lively movement history.", "Certainly there were leaders like Kameny who asserted gay virtue from the outset (though even he scolded two lesbians for holding hands at a march the week after Stonewall). Harry Hay, a founder of the 1950s homophile Mattachine Society, demanded to \u201cbe respected for our differences not for our sameness to heterosexuals.\u201d Carl Wittman, a gay SDS activist, wrote in his 1970 \u201cGay Manifesto,\u201d \u201cWe have to learn that our loving each other is a good thing, not an unfortunate thing, and that we have a lot to teach straights about sex, love, strength, and resistance.\u201d Wittman here voiced not only the equal virtue of gay people but a \u201cvalue-added\u201d notion that the movement had something to teach the world, an achievement Hirshman also attributes to what she dubs the \u201cgay revolution.\u201d", "But if some leaders voiced such ambitious moral sentiments, innumerable others, along with ordinary LGBT people afraid\u2014quite understandably\u2014to ever leave the closet, felt little or no moral certainty about either their goodness or their cause. Even after impressive levels of progress were achieved, it is not clear this was the result of moral certainty. I\u2019d say nearly every LGBT American knows someone\u2014perhaps themselves\u2014who has stood up to fight for equality, perhaps with great success, but despite lingering self-hatred and a profound sense that they were not good, but rotten at their core. When Hirshman says of David Mixner, the prominent anti-war and gay rights activist, that he \u201cknew he was different\u201d and \u201cthought he was bad,\u201d she is pithily describing not just many people in the movement but their motive for joining it.", "In fact, contrary to Hirshman\u2019s assertion, the historical record of the LGBT movement emphasizes an embrace of the hold-your-nose zone of privacy more than an insistence on moral virtue. From the start of the organized gay rights movement in the mid-20", "century, gay leaders embraced this liberal zone of tolerance as their best hope for freedom. And it was", ", more than equality, they sought. Above all, they wanted to be left alone from the entrapment, police raids, and violence of fellow citizens that resulted from being a despised minority.", "This changed over time, of course. By the 1980s, the zone of privacy was inadequate both in practice and in theory. In particular, it was no shield against the ravages of AIDS. Any other public health epidemic of equivalent scale would have (indeed had) drawn far greater government efforts to stop the dying, and the neglect in the case of AIDS was clearly driven by anti-gay animus. The mental and physical anguish that resulted spurred some of the most effective and enduring forms of activism in American history, from the Lavender Hill Mob\u2019s haunting \u201cSilence = Death\u201d poster art to the street theater of ACT UP.", "But did it change to the point that", ", to use Hirshman\u2019s word, properly characterizes the struggle for gay equality? \u201cFueled by its moral ambition,\u201d she writes, the movement not only claimed a place for gays and lesbians at the table, but allowed them to \u201ctake on their whole society and wrench it onto a different path altogether.\u201d Yet although Hirshman argues that the movement \u201cchanged America for everyone,\u201d again and again she describes the conservative co-optings of a political movement whose ultimate effect was less to change the nation than to compel it \u201cto include [gays] in the social contract.\u201d Fighting their way to equal citizenship is no small accomplishment, but it\u2019s a different achievement than changing the nation for everyone. And it\u2019s a more modest achievement than convincing the country that you\u2019re morally good. After all, if just over one-half the nation finds homosexuality acceptable, that still leaves almost one-half that doesn\u2019t. And there\u2019s probably not a single gay American whose day-to-day experience allows them yet to forget this\u2014another reason that declaring \u201cvictory\u201d seems a bit of a stretch.", "Photo byNina Subin.", "Hirshman surely knows this, and in fairness her focus is more on the moral certainty of gay people than the moral conversion of straights. By 2009, the first year of Obama\u2019s presidency, \u201call the pieces were in place\u201d for victory, Hirshman tells us, including that \u201ca critical number of movement players were unambivalent about their moral rectitude.\u201d And when the president signed into law the end of the ban on openly gay troops the next year, \u201cthe moral self-confidence that has characterized the successful parts of the gay revolution from the beginning won the day.\u201d Yet did the gay movement get where it got by internalizing moral certainty? Even after the \u201cmainstreaming\u201d years of the last two decades, as activists turned away from their liberation ideology in favor of joining the most traditional American institutions\u2014the church, the military, and the conjugal family\u2014there was rarely an embrace of morality. Instead, the struggle remained focused on tolerance more than approval, rights more than virtue.", "The 2003 landmark Supreme Court decision that struck down state sodomy bans,", ", was decided on privacy grounds, not equal protection. And when California voters yanked away the freedom to marry from gay people in a 2008 ballot initiative, the LGBT movement chose to fight that battle in defensive terms. The right wing whipped up opposition with ads saying that allowing gays to marry would mean teaching school children it was OK to be gay. The gay movement did not respond,", ", but insisted,", "Certainly a focus on the moral virtues of gay people has become a central theme of the movement as it turned to inclusion in mainstream institutions, as Hirshman points out: \u201cWhen the gay revolution took after marriage and the military, it was making a bid for membership not just in the cold precincts of the liberal state, but in the club of social acceptance. \u201d Marriage is, by definition, a quest for public recognition, and leaders like Evan Wolfson recognized early on that marriage equality was perhaps the most potent weapon to insist on the moral equality of gays, who must not be left \u201cin a little huddle,\u201d as Wolfson said, forever separate and unequal.", "But does this fact support the argument that \u201cmoral confidence\u201d propelled movement victory? African-Americans felt plenty of moral gravity for their cause, yet Hirshman says their movement \u201cfell short\u201d of their most ambitious goals, in part because they could conceal their difference better than gays\u2014a bizarre claim on its face. And if moral certainty was central to the LGBT movement, whose morality was it? Indeed, the whole mainstreaming trend embodied by the fight for marriage and military service is heretical to some who have viewed their movement in fiercely ethical terms, but who have always trumpeted an alternative set of ethics to those of the dominant society: that pleasure is a good in its own right, even when not linked to procreation; that communal ties may create more inclusive care than the isolating and exclusionary nuclear family; that dominant norms are not good just because they\u2019re dominant, but only if they serve the common interest; that people should feel safe to be different.", "To Carl Wittman, who implored gays to \u201cstop mimicking straights\u201d and instead teach them new things about sex and love, or the contemporary queer thinkers who continue to prioritize liberation from dominant norms over affirmation by the majority, mainstream acceptance of LGBT people in church pews and military barracks is hardly a triumph. That Hirshman starts her book with a parable about \u201ca cross-dressing homosexual activist\u201d being named real estate national salesperson of the year and hence becoming a \u201cposter boy\u201d for establishment success might add insult to injury.

Gay people didn\u2019t cause these things to happen\u2014Puritan values began to collapse for complex reasons long before the first gay rights group met in Chicago in 1924. But the LGBT movement contributed mightily. The world feels different, and better, as a result of their struggle for equality. That a straight woman has written such an adoring history of the movement is itself a testament to its impact. Hirshman has done a great service in putting the question of morality in this movement on the table.

Is there now so much to read and learn that we'll never master anything (a concern that dates back", ")? Are all these facts disposable, such that what we learn today will be obsolete tomorrow?", "Daniel Engber\u00a0is a columnist for", ".", "", "The Harvard network scientist and pop theorist Samuel Arbesman stokes our fears of information on the cover of his recent book,", ". Watch out, that title says: The truth is melting! But the argument that Arbesman lays out (in a set of loosely connected anecdotes and essays) works to do the opposite. He uses math as a medication for this anxiety, to keep us calm in the face of shifting knowledge. His book works like a data-beta-blocker: By fitting fickle truths to models and equations, it promises a way to handle life's uncertainty and keep abreast of \"the vibrations in the facts around us.\" In the end, though, the prescription runs afoul of a more fundamental ambiguity: What does it mean to call a fact a", "to start with?", "Arbesman's book expands on a piece he wrote in 2010 for the Ideas section of the", ". That short essay, called \"", ",\" laid out a theory of what Arbesman named the", ". \"When people think of knowledge,\" he wrote, \"they generally think of two sorts of facts.\" One includes the data that should never change, like the atomic weight of hydrogen, while the other comprises all the tidbits that shift from day to day, like the closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Even in the stable camp, facts can mutate: An atom's weight, for example, varies depending on the isotope. But Arbesman is more interested in a third category of knowledge, one that's nestled between the other two in terms of how amenable it is to change. These are the facts that shift too slowly for us to notice, but not so slowly that they'll only matter to our children. \"Mesofacts,\" he says, evolve within our lifetimes but often out of view.", "Mesofacts are the hardest to keep track of, as we have a natural inclination to assume that much of what we learned in school would hold forever true. That means they're just the things we ignore and overlook, leaving us misinformed about the world. Add in the changing fact(!) that there are now more new facts than there were before, and that many of these facts are different, and the problem of the mesofact seems bigger still. But Arbesman hopes to teach us to navigate this blind spot by acknowledging that it's there. If we learn to think about these things that transform behind our backs\u2014if Arbesman can succeed in \"raising awareness of the middle category of facts,\" as he promises on a website he's set up called", "\u2014then we'll be able to expand our minds and fix the world and \u2026", "Well, I'm not sure what else. It's still a little vague, and even after reading", ", I haven't fully grasped the real-world stakes involved. What's clear enough is that the science of mesofacts offers a certain kind of comfort. Instead of showing all this information as a creepy, growing thing, fanning out down paths we'll never follow, Arbesman turns data-spread into something clean and geological\u2014a hard science with hard laws. Facts, he says, crumble according to the rules of mathematics, and though these changes may be susceptible to landslides or tectonic shifts (the invention of the printing press, the theory of evolution, etc.), their changing composition can be understood and explicated.", "For example, studies show that the \"half-life\" of a scientific paper\u2014that is to say, the time it takes to lose half its influence in the field, in terms of how often it gets cited\u2014can be described with some precision. A study in a physics journal loses half its value at a period of 10 years, he says, while the similar decay in urology goes a little faster, at 7.1 years. Or here's another stat: About half the facts we know about the treatment of cirrhosis or hepatitis are rendered obsolete every 45 years.", "These rules don't just apply to specialists. One of the most book's most charming observations concerns the rate at which the rest of us, the nonscientists, figure out that what we thought we knew was wrong. Certain schoolroom facts, says Arbesman, like the fleshy forms of dinosaurs, tend to shift just once per generation. That's because what we learn about these animals gets baked in by our grade-school teachers. If paleontologists make a new discovery\u2014let's say, that", "\u2014we may not hear about it until our own kids bring the news home from school. I'm guessing something similar might apply to culture, too: How many people raised on George Romero would have to learn about the", "from their children, too?", "But what solace the math provides can seem a little slippery. The half-lives and other laws that Arbesman gives have their own propensity to shift and slide. For example, many of the relationships are of a certain shape: The importance (or truth-value) of a given scientific finding will tend to fall along a curvy slope that can be described by a decaying", ". Likewise, citing the work of Derek J. de Solla Price, Arbesman points out that the body of scientific work\u2014the number of new findings, or papers published\u2014increases in a similar way, by rising up an exponential. (These two findings, about the decay of science facts and the growth of scientific output, are closely related: With each new discovery, an older understanding is often overturned or made irrelevant, so an increase in discoveries corresponds to an increase in fact-obsolescence.)", "Yet not every evolution of a fact can be described with an exponential function. Arbesman explains that some specimens of truth (or technology, or trivia) develop according to what's called a", ", an S-shaped curve that starts off looking exponential but flattens on both ends. A population of bacteria cultured in a dish will grow along these lines, dividing freely until the organisms approach a natural limit\u2014a point at which their numbers are restricted by space or nutrients. Arbesman gives an example in his book of the rate at which documents from the Early Middle Ages were duplicated or destroyed. The researcher he cites chose to model this relationship as a logistic function, because, says Arbesman, \"books cannot grow without a bound\" and there is a \"maximum number of copies of a book that can be made.\" But it's not clear why this would be the case. Does he mean that the medieval scribes would run out of ink or paper? Or that they'd just decide, one day, that they've made enough transcriptions?", "There may be a good reason to assume a logistic function in this case, but the example makes it clear that the predictability of changing facts can itself be unpredictable. In 1963, Derek J. de Solla Price wrote up his research on the growth of science and concluded that his exponential function could not describe the future. Since the number of scientists was growing more quickly than the population, at some point we'd reach a saturation point where everyone in the world had become a scientist. Since that would be impossible, he proposed", ".", "Photo by Mark McDonald.", "I don't think that Arbesman would disagree, but the realization that these curves can change would seem to complicate the rules of mesofacts. There are even cases when one exponential rise or fall nests inside another, making it harder still to figure out what's going on. Take last week's publication of an important study on", ". The authors went through about 2,000 papers that had been retracted from biomedical research journals since the early 1970s, and found that the rate of scientific crimes has been", ". In fact, cases of", "appear to be rising exponentially, even as a percentage of the total output of scientific papers (which, of course, is", "). So what does all this mean for the half-life of a scientific fact? Is it speeding up or slowing down? And how does knowing these relationships help me to handle the uncertainty?", "Arbesman wants to calm us with the notion that the facts of how facts change are constant and predictable. It's an appealing notion, and one he's illustrated with an array of intriguing mesofacts.

She writes often of her fear of having Ody die in a cold, soulless hospital, where the \u201cblue needle\u201d would finally kill him, but when I had Lee euthanized, it was done in a homey, comfortable room with a couch and rugs on the floor, and there wasn\u2019t an IV or a steel table in sight.", "---", "by Jessica Pierce.

The new longer-playing records would be more durable than the standard 78s as well as, overall, less expensive: One 12-inch long-playing record featuring an entire symphony would cost $4.85, compared with $7.25 for an album of five conventional 78s containing the same symphony.", "Wallerstein\u2019s announcement was astounding, and the public greeted the news enthusiastically. The very first long-playing recording, of Nathan Milstein performing Mendelssohn\u2019s", "with the New York Philharmonic, Bruno Walter conducting, appeared in shops only a week after the press conference. By the end of 1948, Columbia had sold 1,250,000 long-playing records.", "Nearly as remarkable as Columbia\u2019s announcement, in retrospect, was the refusal of its archrival, RCA Victor, to enter the long-playing field. CBS management had quietly apprised David Sarnoff, the head of RCA, about the breakthrough in April 1948, months ahead of the public announcement, with an offer to license the technology. Columbia presumed that if all the record companies released some version of the LP, the public\u2019s acceptance of and adaptation to the new format would proceed all the more smoothly. Wallerstein repeated the offer at the Waldorf press conference. Most of the other recording companies agreed, but RCA turned it down and, early in 1949, announced its own new development of a 7-inch unbreakable record that would play at 45-rpm. No less interested than Columbia in finding a solution to the problems in playing long-form musical pieces on 78s, RCA had developed a rapid record changer, which would allow listeners to stack a large number of records around oversized spindles above the turntable. The records, which played at 45 rpm, would then quickly and automatically drop to the turntable in ordered succession, creating a virtually uninterrupted flow of music. The goal was the same as that of CBS\u2019s microgroove LP; RCA simply pursued it with a different technology.

Finally, in January 1950, having lost $4.5 million as well as some valuable artists such as the opera singer Ezio Pinza (other artists including Artur Rubenstein and Jascha Heifetz were threatening to leave as well), RCA threw in the towel and announced it would market its own 33\u2153-rpm long-playing records. RCA\u2019s efforts with the rapid record changer were not totally futile; indeed, for 30 years the 45 would be the industry\u2019s favored medium for pop singles, as well as for automatic jukeboxes, which benefited from RCA\u2019s new changer design. (Columbia even began issuing its own 45s in 1951.)

In addition to being a giant best-seller, Kingsolver is the winner of a National Book Award, the Orange Prize, and the National Humanities Medal, and is a regular on the lists of other prizes and honors. But she is not, typically, viewed as playing on the same field as many of the English-speaking-world\u2019s greatest authors. This is not simply a matter of gender; Kingsolver is rarely even mentioned alongside Zadie Smith, or Alice Munro, or even her likeliest boon companion among today\u2019s \u201cserious\u201d female novelists, Ann Patchett.

On this one point, we are all Meadow Soprano.", "Ideally, I\u2019d like to hit this point of an essay able to tell you that the dismissal of Kingsolver is wrong, wrong, wrong, and that her new book proves it, that it is a new masterpiece of moral fiction for the modern age.

If you\u2019re stumbling over that name, I\u2019ll say that I join you, and also advise you to steel yourself. Other characters in this book have names like Ovid Byron, and there\u2019s a father-and-son set referred to as Bear and Cub, and children have rich-Brooklyn names like Preston and Cordelia. I know nothing of the naming conventions of Southern Appalachia, where the Turnbows make their home, but I do know that these names come across as a distraction in this text. If they are indeed gestures at authenticity, they fail.", "It\u2019s not a matter of subjective aesthetic, either. The cutesy names contrast quite starkly with the kind of book Kingsolver wants", "to be. She is not writing a chipper, feel-good story about a plucky young woman who saves the world. Her aspirations are subtler than, say,", ". In the opening chapter, she gives Dellarobia a quasi-religious vision, predicated on the arrival of a flock of monarch butterflies in the region. The beauty of that sight belies the sinister fact that the \u201cKing Billies,\u201d as one local calls them, are there because climate change has messed with their instincts to migrate south. The miracle is actually a harbinger, and not of another miracle.", "So already at the end of the first chapter, we\u2019ve hit a speed bump. There\u2019s no saving those butterflies, we know, from the get-go. The problem with writing a novel about climate change\u2014and Kingsolver is not the first to attempt it\u2014is that the issue is fundamentally abstract. There is very little one person can do to stop the icebergs from melting. That is not to pronounce against everyone doing their part; it\u2019s simply to say that as a dramatic engine, climate change doesn\u2019t have much of heart. It\u2019s all indifferent gears in there.", "That leaves Kingsolver with a curious deficit of suspense, and even plot. So she stuffs 400 pages with information about monarchs and their habits, stringing them between tales of the disintegrating marriage between Dellarobia and Cub, and her growing affection for Byron, the scientist who\u2019s come to investigate the phenomenon. There are also interstitial comments on the class biases, and pure economics, that are preventing Dellarobia\u2019s extended family from seeing the crisis before them, and acting accordingly.", "What results is unwieldy and, at times, dense. There are, of course, people who enjoy fiction that largely serves to deliver information. The legions of fans of historical fiction, and even to some degree science fiction, attest to that. But the need to devolve so frequently into exposition and description of inert landscapes jars the reader out of a moment. No amount of stylized prose can cover that, though Kingsolver gamely tries. In some cases, she tries a little too hard: \u201cThe fir forest when she reached it had its own air as always, dark and still. Within its snow-flocked boughs she began to pick out snow-laced colonnades of butterflies, first a few, then more, as her eyes adjusted to their wintry aspect.\u201d The more Kingsolver trills and fusses in the prose, the more the whole thing starts to sink like a stone.", "Some kind of weight is what she\u2019s going for, of course. Kingsolver is the founder of the PEN/Bellwether prize for \u201csocially engaged fiction.\u201d The mere existence of such an award implies Kingsolver\u2019s agreement with a school of thought that argues for less navel-gazing in fiction, for art that actually wants to transform something more than the reader\u2019s self-conception.", "In this preoccupation with the function of fiction, Kingsolver finds herself some interesting bedfellows. The question of what we want fiction to do, if it\u2019s the head, the heart, or some blended soup of both, that makes it important, preoccupies the \u201cserious\u201d novelists too. \u201cSick of sound of own voice. Sick of trying to make own voice appear on that white screen. Sick of trying to pretend, for sake of agent and family, that idea of putting words on blank page feels important,\u201d Zadie Smith wrote, in her", "\u2014and quasi-capitulation\u2014to James Wood\u2019s famous charge that she and other postmodern novelists were \u201c", ".\u201d Wood himself had complained that the excessive incorporation of what he called \u201csocial reality\u201d led to novels that dated quickly, and moreover \u201cthat know a thousand things but do not know a single human being.\u201d", "Which is funny, because if there is one thing", "knows well, it\u2019s people. That comes from Kingsolver\u2019s frankly exceptional skill at rendering the smaller human dramas that result from the big, societal themes she\u2019s embracing. That becomes clear in", "final third, where less is left to say about butterflies than about what their end means for the characters she\u2019s set afloat watching them.

Instead the couple got married and, less than a year later, had Alison. They settled down in rural Pennsylvania to what appears to have been long lives of thwarted ambitions and painful secrets. For two people with artistic longings, they were utterly trapped by the conventional masks society told them they should wear. Bruce, it turned out, was a closeted homosexual.

She asked, \u201cDo you remember this?\u201d The essay was returned covered in red ink, with suggestions to use stronger verbs and fewer adverbs.

But a handful of important modern plays are published each year by academic and trade presses, and they\u2019re intended for \u2026 whom? People, somewhere, who just enjoy reading drama.

But either way, the experience itself wasn't complete and wasn't supposed to be, as a novel is. When you read a novel you\u2019re the audience, with the author the director. You buy your ticket and see the work whole. When you read a play, though, you can read it close up, like an actor, or far away, like a director, but you can't do both, at least not at the same time.

How might the experience differ? First and foremost, it was a tremendous relief. Reading the plays to myself had been a deeply anxious experience: Every page, as I worked to cultivate those seeds, I wondered about which ones I was missing, and whether I wasn't picking the wrong ones. Perhaps I wasn't reading it correctly? Had I missed a key detail of character as I tried to puzzle out a thorny plot twist? Or was I neglecting the story to focus on Masha, the whore, and her relationship with the preacher? Hearing it aloud let me leave the acting to my friends and at least direct my own version, in my head, of what I could now enjoy as a work in and of itself.

This tried-and-true method keeps people from sinking into collective depression.\u201d And, later, he continues this notion: \u201cSeeing their serenity, you can imagine how much they know about pain, hunger, and death, and how much violent joy lives inside them. Joy and pain are transformed in singing and in dance. \u2026 If we listen more carefully, we might be surprised to discover that the words that got us up on the dance floor are achingly sad.

This process of composition is an image of how Haiti must reconstruct itself\u2014from the inside. The country is too often assumed to be a backward place: The First World has trouble remembering that Haitians were two centuries ahead of us in abolishing slavery and in extending full rights of citizenship to everyone, regardless of race. The former slaves who founded the first independent black state in the Western Hemisphere did it their own way, without any assistance or encouragement from surrounding international powers. It should be no real surprise that the templates for reform, progress, and democratization imported to Haiti more recently tend to fit very poorly. The apparently desultory structure of Laferri\u00e8re\u2019s memoir reflects the style in which Haitians have always got their business done.", "A great many voyagers have been astonished by Haiti, and some have benefited from the experience, and some have brought benefits to the country. The explosion of interest and sympathy that followed the earthquake involved enormous amounts of genuine, sincere, and poorly informed good will. It takes patience for learning new ways for any outsider to stay the course in Haiti. Outsiders who have that patience, plus a considerable openness of mind, can do some real good in the country, but, inevitably, most of them don\u2019t. \u201cWe got used to being the planet\u2019s center of attention too quickly,\u201d Laferri\u00e8re writes. \u201cWhere are the cameras now?

There\u2019s a really nice moment in the life of a piece of writing where the writer starts to get a feeling of it outgrowing him\u2014or he starts to see it having a life of its own that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with his ego or his desire to \u201cbe a good writer.\u201d It\u2019s almost like an animal starts to appear in the stone and then it starts to move, and you, the writer, are rooting for it so hard\u2014but may not be able to see everything clearly after working on that stone for so long.", "If a writer understands his work as something that originates with him but then, with any luck, gets away from him, then what he needs is someone who can grasp the potential of the piece and lead him to that higher ground.

I never strain to find passages in your work where I can write \u201cI love this\u201d in the margin and really mean it. But it\u2019s also freeing, as an editor, to know that your partner in the process\u2014the writer\u2014is so open to suggestions, and to reworking things, and pushing deeper into an idea, or a scene, that might seem good enough as it is. I never get the sense that you don\u2019t want to be bothered to make something better. And I often find that you have a pretty good sense of what I\u2019m going to say, anyway.

Was this a conscious thing?", "It wasn\u2019t exactly conscious, I don\u2019t think, because the book came together over such a long time. It might have just been developmental: I got older and moved into a new stage of life. And in that new stage, things look different. But I think the most truthful explanation is a little more technical. I would come to some fork in the road in a story and it would seem that certain choices weren\u2019t interesting, in part because either I\u2019d done them before or had seen them done before. So in order to keep interested I\u2019d have to swerve in a new direction, and that direction often tended to be \u2026 (and here I\u2019m struggling for the word, so as not to sound full of it) \u2026 but maybe \u2026 well, I found myself trying to avoid what we might call the \u201cknee-jerk negative swerve.\u201d Or \u201cthe choice that indicates humans are always shit.\u201d", "I turned 54 this year and I find myself feeling like I\u2019m in a bit of a race to get down on paper the way I really feel about life\u2014or the way it has presented to me.

(\u201cHappiness writes white,\u201d said de Montherlant, who was, Wikipedia told me when I just now went to find out who\u2019d said that, a Nazi collaborator.) But I can look back at the way I thought and felt even as a little kid and there was a lot of wonder there, and openness to the many sides of life\u2014the way that beauty and ugliness co-present, for example, or the way that tragedy might be enshrouded in something really funny, or vice versa\u2014and I feel like I\u2019ve only barely scratched the surface so far in what I\u2019ve been able to write. And I have finally realized that, you know, it\u2019s not a given that my lifespan will accommodate my writing aspirations. It could be that it would take me 12 more books at six years each to get it\u2014which means I would have to live to be 126. Which I fully intend to do, of course. But it seems to me that there are certain thoughts and vignettes and attitudes that I have always had the desire to represent\u2014but that I\u2019m only now picking up the chops and/or confidence to pull off. So, good news/bad news: good news that I\u2019m progressing; bad news that life is short and art is long.", "Let\u2019s talk about nonfiction. I spent 15 years in magazines, editing stories, and I never encountered another writer who worked like you. Your drafts were incredible.

Otherwise, why the crystalline outtake file? What a beautiful system. So the process, for me, became merging documents, essentially: picking my favorite outtakes, and working them into the final story. How did you come up with that system? I noticed you also do it with some of your short stories, too. Isn\u2019t it hard to put something back into a story once you\u2019ve taken it out?", "It\u2019s a little like packing for a trip.

Like, I could make a really ruthless cut", "I knew that you would eventually see the cut bits and call me on it if I was being too Draconian.", "Do you still get that panicky feeling in your stomach when you send a story to an editor?", "Yes, and I hope I always do. I think that\u2019s a respectful way to feel.

Meanwhile, Conard and Janeway share", "common experiences as private investors but differ in their politics. Conard speaks to the great unwashed from a fortress of assumed technical omniscience, arguing the case for a brutally divided society of givers and takers in which a tiny number of the former take risks and fuel growth that allows everyone else to bathe in self-indulgence. Conard provides the grim underpinning for Mitt Romney\u2019s 47 percent, while insisting that actions that allow greater risk-taking\u2014including the activities of banks involved in the meltdown of 2008\u2014were actually good, not bad; necessary steps to drive growth, productivity, and innovation, not a moral and financial disaster.", "Janeway is the son of Eliot Janeway, an economic commentator and adviser to Roosevelt and Johnson, and the novelist Elizabeth Janeway; his liberal political tendencies thus come naturally, supplemented by a long study of Keynesian economics, including close contact with one of Keynes\u2019 greatest disciples, Hyman Minsky. In fact, he has long pursued two careers, which effectively inform each other: as an economist at Cambridge University (home of Keynes) delving into the financial breakdown of 1929-31; and as a Wall Street practitioner who learned at the well-shod feet of Ferdinand Eberstadt, venture capitalist Fred Adler, and John Vogelstein, one of the founders of Warburg Pincus, Janeway\u2019s longtime firm.", "Janeway\u2019s case studies, based on his own experiences both in the insular club of private partnerships that was 1960s Wall Street, and as an early venture investor in emerging biotech and computing concerns, are often fascinating and insightful, if arcane for those who don\u2019t recall the history. But he continually tries to extract broader conclusions from these cases, focusing on the essential role government played in incubating those industries. Janeway lays out what he calls the \u201cThree-Player Game\u201d necessary to fuel innovation: the state, financial capitalism, and the market economy (that is, \u201cinstitutions that enable the production and exchange of goods and services\u201d). This is a three-legged stool; weaken any leg, say by deregulation or by overregulation, and you spawn instabilities and stagnation. He envisions a kind of creative tension that has broken down with the free-market ascendancy. \u201cThat very success in \u2018liberating\u2019 the market economy from the encroachment of the state has potentially dire consequences for the Innovation Economy,\u201d he writes.", "Janeway\u2019s real target here is in the \u201cinnovation economy,\u201d the nurturing of new, transformational technologies. Without mentioning them, he seems to be acknowledging fears from the likes of Peter Thiel and Tyler Cowen that we\u2019ve entered a period of technological stagnation. He believes government must step in to support R&D where private investors fear to tread\u2014where risk is too high, costs too steep, or investment periods too long.", "But Janeway also recognizes that speculation is intertwined in any innovative activity. Without speculation, markets would not participate in supporting anything risky\u2014from early biotech to desktop computing to renewable energy. Capitalists (certainly Wall Street) always try to escape what historian Fernand Braudel calls \u201cthe world of transparence and regularity,\u201d and seek windfalls, what Braudel calls \u201csuper-profits.\u201d Regulatory arbitrage\u2014the drive to do business where oversight is lightest\u2014is built into the business model of Wall Street. So is greed. So is speculation.", "This speculative enterprise always has an element of a lottery. Not only is greed eternal, but markets have often been casinos; take risk away and reward goes with it\u2014nowhere more so than in venture capital. Given those realities, and their material benefits, markets require strong government oversight. What defines markets is the kind of uncertainty that Keynes propounded, but that many of Keynes\u2019 postwar disciples effectively undercut when they mathematized his doctrines, only to be further buried by free-market economists who built mechanical models that afforded markets an omniscient wisdom, efficiency, and rationality. Janeway rejects those attempts to make markets their own justification, noting that their failure to predict the two great bubbles of the new millennium has made them increasingly suspect as useful tools.", "This brings us to the nature and importance of bubbles, which are popularly viewed as reckless episodes of lunacy and corruption. Janeway, who has studied bubbles since his research into 1929, is more sanguine.

Janeway understands the differences between a less damaging stock-market bubble, such as the dot-com bubble, and one involving banks, as in 2008. He recognizes how some bubbles leave the world better off, with innovations scattered across the landscape for our use, while other bubbles leave behind wastelands.", "Janeway is seeking a balance between paradoxical forces. He views capitalism, for better or worse, as a massive set of necessary experiments that churn out considerable waste. Because the future is unknown\u2014he quotes Thomas Hobbes on \u201cthe future being but a fiction of the mind\u201d\u2014there is no rational equilibrium discernable in markets, and investors make decisions with less-than-perfect knowledge. In other words, they\u2019re wrong a sizeable portion of the time, but they\u2019re not irrational. To maximize the odds of bringing new innovations steadily to the market, a lot of bets have to be laid. Many of them will go awry, sometime in big ways. But that\u2019s the price to be paid for material progress.", "In Janeway\u2019s view, governments have a responsibility to insure that innovative capitalism thrives. They must actively regulate markets that need policing and that are prone to breakdown; they must support long-term R&D; they must serve as lenders of last resort; they must intervene when things blow up, particularly when demand flags. (Janeway, near the end of the book, offers a chapter on the absurdity of austerity in a financial crisis that could come from Paul Krugman.) So much of this is commonsensical, though he does leave some issues hanging, particularly on how to retain that three-party balance. He does not deal at any depth with regulatory and political capture, often by interests that have been empowered by markets. He does not deal with inequality or the effects of a financial capitalism that has become so large, complex, speculative and global.", "But that\u2019s simply to say Janeway can\u2019t solve all our problems. What he does very well \u2014 besides provide head-clearing historical perspectives \u2014 is lead us to back to fundamentals. Why capitalism? Why markets?

Is there such thing as a \u201cgreat Mormon novel\u201d? Will there ever be? I\u2019m not sure. But there is now, undeniably, a Mormon presence in American letters. (Looking beyond fiction there are several other notable writers with Mormon pasts: Terry Tempest Williams, Neil Labute, Dustin Lance Black, and so on.) This is a good thing, I think, for American letters\u2014and for Mormonism. In fact, it\u2019s the latter effect that strikes me more today. In 2010, when I wrote about \u201cthe great Mormon novel,\u201d I was more concerned with how such a book might affect readers mostly ignorant of the religion.

Increasingly, it feels reasonable to think about \u201cMormon\u201d as a category that includes people who don\u2019t go to church, or who don\u2019t even believe in God. Much of the LDS faithful would dispute that, I suspect\u2014but some of them also probably think, consciously or no, of such people as part of the fold. Fiction can introduce you to worlds you don\u2019t know, and put you in the shoes of people who aren\u2019t like you.

Pearlman\u2019s self-appointed task is to examine the rise of omnivorous taste in fine dining\u2014\u201comnivorous,\u201d in this case, referring to the consumption of both traditionally highbrow and traditionally lowbrow culture. Just 50 years ago, fancy restaurants adhered to a strict formula: white tablecloths, French food (described on French-language menus), mai\u0302tre d\u2019s who built careful reputations on their ability to cater to the right kind of people. Today, chefs are celebrated rather than mai\u0302tre d\u2019s, and they build reputations on their creativity, not their adherence to tradition. What\u2019s more, though chandeliers and complicated place settings persist in certain upscale eateries, expensive restaurants are characterized as often as not by eclectic interior design or even aggressively casual atmospheres. (Think of Mission Chinese Food\u2019s original outpost in San Francisco, sharing a seating area with a dive-y Chinese takeout joint.) Pearlman, an art historian at Cal Poly Pomona, seeks to tease apart the causes and meanings of this sea change in the way the gourmet set eats.", "She accomplishes this in a rather roundabout way. After a thorough and somewhat tedious history of omnivorous restaurants, beginning with Chez Panisse in 1975, Pearlman examines the broader societal changes that have encouraged fancy restaurants to abandon the formal structures of", "and to prize individuality and multiculturalism. Finally, she does close-readings of two specific restaurant trends: first, exhibition kitchens (i.e., restaurant design that allows diners to watch chefs prepare their food), and second, \u201cchefs creating gourmet versions of commonplace dishes.\u201d", "Pearlman supports her findings with sometimes ludicrously detailed observations (she counts four distinct categories of exhibition kitchen and devotes about 100 words to describing each), wraps them tightly in careful qualifiers, and sometimes reports them obliquely in academese. They are nonetheless a damning indictment of bourgeois dining habits.", "For instance, about those exhibition kitchens: Pearlman gently exposes the irony inherent in what she dubs \u201cthe theater of manual labor.\u201d Well-heeled patrons have begun paying a premium for seating arrangements that give them a view of their food as it\u2019s cooked.

(Many restaurants with open kitchens relegate menial labor and ugly industrial equipment to enormous prep kitchens behind closed doors.) What makes this trend particularly galling is that it coincides with a spate of chef memoirs (like Bourdain\u2019s", ") that detail the demeaning demands, unpleasant working conditions, and disruptive hours of professional kitchen jobs. Foodies hypothetically know better\u2014they know restaurants are built on the backs of grunts\u2014but they pay extra not to help improve kitchen labor conditions, but to induce chefs to play-act a fantasy of leisurely, creative cooking. So much for foodie solidarity with the people who produce their food.", "Foodie culture demands a similar self-serving fantasy when it comes to chefs\u2019 combinations of world cuisines\u2014what used to be known as \u201cfusion\u201d food, before that term lost its cachet.

Comfort food, indeed.", "Pearlman brings up comfort food by means of discussing two simultaneous yet polarized trends in haute cuisine: that of transforming commoditized fast food into upscale fare and that of glorifying simple, traditional preparations. As she breezed through related concepts\u2014including modernist cuisine\u2019s winking redefinitions of familiar food items, and menus that painstakingly catalog where each ingredient comes from\u2014I wished she would take a step back and define her argument in more detail. It is this section of", "that feels the most rushed and disjointed, but along the way Pearlman hints at the ultimate irony of the sea change in fine dining in America over the past half-century: While gourmet food appears to be undergoing a process of democratization, it is in fact becoming more exclusive than ever.", "Prior to the 1960s, food was refined because of what a chef did with it:", "\"The aesthetics of", "depend on high degrees of transformation in the form and texture of raw ingredients. Such refinement, which is both literal and figurative, relies on multistepped, labor-intensive processes that, through techniques such as sauce making and straining, tend to remove coarseness\u2014literally, the unrefined nature of raw ingredients.\"", "The importance of technique was emphasized on menus from that era: A 1956 menu from New York\u2019s famed Le Pavilion, for instance, included \u201cGrenouille Provenc\u0327ale\u201d and \u201cSole Anglaise\u201d\u2014dish titles that tell you the style in which the frogs and sole are cooked.", "Today, no self-respecting chef would dream of putting \u201cGrenouille Provenc\u0327ale\u201d or \u201cSole Anglaise\u201d on his menu without also telling you how those frogs were pampered and where that sole was line-caught. Contemporary diners demand refinement not via cooking method but via pedigree. Produce must emerge from the soil\u2014the right kind of soil, on the right farm, run by the right kind of people\u2014in a state of perfection. Pearlman favorably recalls a meal at Tom Colicchio\u2019s Craft in New York, a James Beard Foundation Award winner, so minimalist that a side dish of heirloom tomato salad \u201cconsisted of only tomatoes in a light, colorless vinaigrette.\u201d Salads on", "run between $14 and $18.

Matthews", "It used to be that human ingenuity was valued in the kitchen. Now, what matters more is chefs\u2019 knowing the right producers and buying the right products. Culinary excellence can no longer be achieved simply by learning the right technique; it can be acquired only by knowing the right things to buy\u2014and by, it needs hardly be said, shelling out however much money it takes to buy them. In this way, modern foodies\u2019 materialistic definition of refinement is more exclusive than that of yesteryear\u2019s dogmatic French cooking. What appears to be a celebration of the natural and the simple is in fact more constrictive and less attainable, because it depends not on talent but on means and access. (In this way, the evolution of culinary refinement reminds me of the concurrent evolution of women\u2019s fashions, which used to let women hide imperfections by wearing girdles but now require women to maintain lithe frames without any artifice\u2014an even more oppressive requirement.)", "Materialism and agricultural name-dropping have not snuffed out all appreciation for skill\u2014indeed, as Pearlman chronicles, the ascendance of ingredient worship has paralleled a polar-opposite trend, that of modernist cuisine. Born in Ferran Adria\u2019s elBulli in Catalonia, Spain, and raised in American outposts like WD-50 in New York and Alinea in Chicago, modernism utilizes laboratory chemicals and equipment to give foods surprising appearances and textures. Modernists chefs are often hailed as avant-gardists, but the pieces Pearlman highlights in", "reveal a troublingly reactionary attitude. Deconstructed, disguised, minimized reinterpretations of Heath bars, doughnuts, cheesesteaks, and burgers simultaneously mock anyone unhip enough to prefer the original version and applaud their eater\u2019s advanced palate and dainty appetite. On the topic of these self-congratulatory simulacra of populist favorites, Pearlman is far too forgiving. Of a modernist bite-sized dessert that is made to look exactly like a tiny McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger, she writes:", "\"However good the illusion, would anyone really mistake Moto\u2019s BURGER with cheese for the fast-food familiar? No more than one would confuse an Andy Warhol silk screen of Campbell\u2019s soup cans with Campbell\u2019s soup.\"", "But it is not 1962, a petit four is not a silk screen, and McDonald\u2019s burgers are not merely a symbol of commercialism. In 2013, fast food and junk food are heavily burdened with class connotations: They have become practically synonymous with poverty and its attendant aesthetic problem, the so-called obesity epidemic. To target them for artistic critique is to take a potshot at the proletariat. To put that \u201cart\u201d on plates and serve it to upper-class foodies is to flatter their sense of deserved social superiority.

The argument is seductive but specious\u2014what tastes good to one person won\u2019t taste good to another\u2014and dangerous. In the final section of her book, Pearlman notes that food-focused publications have increasingly covered issues related to environmentalism, labor, and politics over the last decade\u2014but only \u201cas problems to be solved not by collective political action but by individual shopping choices\u2014in other words, consumption.\u201d If consumption is virtuous, only those with the economic means to consume discriminately can have virtue.

But I also mention it because Greenberg, who is an excellent, thoroughgoing reporter, makes an understandable slip in his summary of my essay. My mother hadn\u2019t \u201cgotten me diagnosed.\u201d She\u2019d arrived at my diagnosis herself, after consultations with teachers and experts dating back to my infancy. Starting when I was in pre-school, teachers called her into conferences to share their concerns about me. I liked to play by myself, bent over my little projects, and seemed not to hear when someone said something to me irrelevant to those projects. I jumped up and down and flapped my hands. I was a tree sloth on the soccer field. In elementary school I acquired a group of close friends, but was shy and bad at eye contact. Apparently, I was spooked by powerful smells and loud sounds. She consulted with a local expert on Asperger\u2019s before the diagnosis was fashionable. Though I have no memory of this, she remembers reading aloud the criteria for Asperger\u2019s from the", "when I was a teenager. In her recollection, I responded, \u201cSounds like me.\u201d By then I was mostly just pretentious, but my mother hadn\u2019t forgotten the behaviors I exhibited as a child.

Although an advocate for Aspies might retort that perhaps I\u2019ve studied social interaction precisely because I lack an intuition for it.) My mother\u2019s well-intentioned diagnosis didn\u2019t do me any lasting harm, but for a while it made me more paranoid and insecure than I might have been. The other subjects in that educational video, boys chanting in monotones about Power Ranger dolls and sea-creatures, were allegedly my neurological brethren, albeit from a different place on the spectrum. At 30, I might have shrugged it off. But I watched the finished video at 22, when the transition from dork to hopefully-semi-cool Brooklynite and aspiring writer was recent, fragile, and all-important.

My mother is a discerning psychologist who cares deeply about the happiness of her children. She\u2019s disinclined to pathologize adolescent behavior.

But she, like many therapists in the late \u201990s, embraced Asperger\u2019s as an elastic category.

(At the last minute, and, Frances tells Greenberg, too loosely defined). By \u201csaving normal,\u201d Frances means that he wants the next generation of psychiatrists to erect a bulwark against the wanton expansion of diagnostic boundaries.", "Whereas Greenberg sees more honor in frank ambiguity:", "\u201cNo one knows what would happen if psychiatrists simply let themselves out of their epistemic prison by no longer pretending to know what they can\u2019t know. No one knows what would happen if they simply told you that they don\u2019t know what illness (if any) is causing your anxiety or depression or agitation, and then, if they thought it was warranted, told you there are drugs that might help (although they don\u2019t really know why or at what cost to the brain, or whether you will be able to stop taking them if you want to; nor can they guarantee that you\u2014or your child\u2014won\u2019t become obese or diabetic or die early), and offer you a prescription.\u201d", "That sounds pretty appealing when the examples you use are \u201canxiety or depression or agitation.\u201d In fact, as Greenberg points out a page later, the above conversation is probably the one a lot of family doctors have with their patients when they prescribe antidepressants. But what if the example you use is the autism spectrum, and the patient is a kid? It seems problematic to tell a 10-year-old, or even a 20-year-old, that she", "be on the autism spectrum.

Would you be able to say, \u201cAw hell, this quote-unquote disorder is just an intellectual construct anyway\u201d? That strikes me as a situation in which transparent conjecture might cause substantial harm.", "And besides, a lot of medicine is mysterious, not just psychiatry. Doctors of all kinds are forced to make educated guesses as a matter of routine. They still try to follow an exacting set of common guidelines for treatment. Greenberg anticipates this argument, countering that \u201cpsychiatry, much more than other medical specialties, is still deeply in the debt of ancient medicine.\u201d But he does not address the intrusion of politics and culture on all manner of healthcare. Surely the debate about whether childbirth should be medicalized is a cultural and political one. As is the fight over whether we should consider an ailing 95-year-old \u201csick,\u201d when said 95-year-old demands constant medical attention and a poor 40-year-old can\u2019t afford to see a doctor. If the difference between psychiatry and the rest of medicine is a matter of the", "of uncertainty, is psychiatry really trapped in its own \u201cepistemic prison?\u201d", "There is a reasonable case for a psychiatric bible designed to nip protestant speculation in the bud and written in a papal cast of mind.

There he received the finest education in Aristotelian philosophy and, in Nadler\u2019s words, \u201cscientifically antiquated but religiously acceptable theories of the cosmos.\u201d It was this orthodoxy Descartes would later overturn. While he is remembered today as the philosopher who said, \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d Descartes\u2019 work extended much further. He was a brilliant mathematician and he wrote extensively on biology, optics, and cosmology. In science, his grand project was to replace the abstractions of Aristotelianism with a mechanistic picture of the universe that could be explained solely in terms of matter, motion, and impact. In philosophy his quest was for a point of absolute certainty, the solid foundation upon which he could build a new system of thought. The clich\u00e9 about Descartes is that he asked the right questions (What can we know for sure, and by what method can we find it out?) but gave the wrong answers.

Is the portrait really by Hals? And if so, is it really a portrait of Descartes? And if it is, who brought the thinker and the philosopher together? Nadler seeks out the answers by reconstructing Descartes\u2019 life in the Netherlands, where he wrote and published many of his major works. \u201cDescartes belongs as much to the intellectual culture of the Dutch Golden Age as he does to the grand history of Western philosophy,\u201d Nadler tells us.

In investigating the story of the picture, he must tell at least three further stories\u2014that of Descartes (the philosopher), Hals (the painter) and Augustijn Alsten Bloemaert (the priest who commissioned the painting). What\u2019s more, Nadler aims to explain the whole of Descartes\u2019 philosophy and science, and give the reader a sense of life during the Dutch Golden Age\u2014all in the space of a 200-page book.

Nadler follows recent scholars such as Desmond Clarke in emphasizing Descartes\u2019 role as a philosopher of the scientific revolution. This helps explain why Descartes was so keen to establish the position for which he would be later ridiculed\u2014that mind and body are distinct substances. Dualism was a weapon against obscurantism. Descartes wanted to cut away, in Nadler\u2019s words, the \u201cspiritual or mind-like elements (such as the immaterial forms and qualities of the Aristotelians)\u201d that were commonly associated with the physical realm. Descartes replaced this spiritual understanding of matter with something simpler.

In Nadler\u2019s helpful formulation: \u201cOne cannot possibly doubt one\u2019s own existence, no matter how hard one tries.

And so he\u2019s arguing for a return to the spirit of Romanticism, to an intellectual culture that looks to poets and philosophers and artists, rather than scientists, for insight into what used to be called \u201cthe human condition.\u201d", "As anyone who has read his previous book", "will know, White is a mad-as-hell merchant. His anger can be rhetorically persuasive, particularly when he\u2019s taking on sci-tech evangelists for ignoring the extent to which post-Enlightenment rationality has been responsible for at least as much human suffering as religion. \u201cIn spite of its obsession with Jews,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe horror of Nazism was not a religious nightmare; it was a nightmare of administrative efficiency.\u201d\u00a0But his indignation has a tendency to curdle into sour, ineffectual derision. It isn\u2019t that his targets aren\u2019t richly deserving of his wrath; it\u2019s that it\u2019s so often channeled into puzzlingly irrelevant ad hominem attacks and hastily constructed straw men.", "White has it in for the theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who insisted that \u201cthere is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made from atoms acting according to the laws of physics.\u201d But instead of seriously pursuing the troubling implications of this anti-humanist notion, he plunges us down the off-ramp and starts zipping along the low road at a ferocious clip: \u201cI hope you will agree that this is a very disappointing conclusion for someone who was almost as famous for playing the bongos and going to strip clubs as he was for physics.\u201d", "The next time Feynman appears, he\u2019s introduced as \u201cbongo man Feynman.\u201d", "Maybe I\u2019m missing something here, but it\u2019s not apparent to me how a person\u2019s enthusiasm for bongos and strip clubs has any bearing on whether his scientific ideas are worth taking seriously. This is about as clear a case as I\u2019ve ever encountered of playing the man rather than the ball. And it\u2019s frustrating not because you feel Feynman is being unfairly traduced but because this stuff is just not worth talking about in this context; it\u2019s a pointless diversion, and it erodes your faith in White as a navigator of the territory.", "A more serious problem is a tendency to oversimplify and caricature the views he\u2019s engaging with. White has a very strong case against Jonah Lehrer (whose ideas, he points out, remain standing even though his journalistic reputation has been toppled). The version of creativity that Lehrer sells in his book", "is, for White, a trite and desiccated thing, the business of mere dutiful neurons; worse, it collapses any distinction between Beethoven and some guy who invented a new type of mop. Creativity, in the view of Lehrer and other biz-phil savants, is a means toward an end; it\u2019s useful because it contributes to a \u201ccreative economy.\u201d But White chooses to demonstrate the extent to which this kind of thinking has infected the culture as a whole by presenting us with an imagined dialogue \u201cbetween an arts council board member and a \u2018difficult\u2019 person like me\u201d:", "\u201cOh! Art! We must save it!\u201d she says.", "\u201cReally? Why?\u201d I ask.", "\u201cWell! Because it\u2019s so beautiful, of course!\u201d", "\u201cCan you please stop talking with exclamation marks? You\u2019re as bad as a Tea-bagger going on about the federal deficit.\u201d", "\u201cSorry! If not because it\u2019s beautiful, then because our children ought to learn to be creative.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cBecause that\u2019s nice, don\u2019t you think? Are you trying to confuse me?\u201d", "If you have a bullshit detector, these \u201creasons\u201d should set it off, even if you also think, \u201cOh, let her say what she likes, the moron, since it\u2019s in my interest. ...\u201d", "The readings are pretty high on the old bullshit detector here all right, but not for the reasons White wants to suggest. There are surely more effective ways to discredit a real set of assumptions than having an imagined moron coolly interrogated by an imagined Curtis White. But he does this kind of thing again and again; the book is so filled with reductive imaginings of ideas that are already sufficiently weak in their actual form that the whole enterprise seems in danger of becoming a Million Straw Man March on the citadel of scientism.", "Courtesy of Melville House", "There\u2019s certainly a very real need to march on that citadel, because the idea that there can be only one kind of truth has to be deeply damaging to the intellectual development of a culture. You don\u2019t have to devalue empiricism to believe that there are kinds of understanding that can\u2019t be accessed in a controlled, peer-reviewed experiment. The problem, obviously, isn\u2019t science; it\u2019s the arrogance with which many scientists, and popularizers of science, dismiss the value of other ways of thinking about questions of meaning, about the world and our place in it. Lehrer, say, wants us to believe that, because neurologists can demonstrate how Observable Phenomenon X was happening in Part Y of Bob Dylan\u2019s brain when he wrote \u201cLike a Rolling Stone,\u201d science can therefore \u201cexplain\u201d the human capacity for creativity or imagination. This is like saying that the song itself is best appreciated by putting it on your stereo and then mapping the sound waves it creates. It doesn\u2019t really tell us anything useful, or usefully true. But this is the kind of truth in which scientism, and the culture that accommodates it, puts most stock.", "I\u2019ve spent a good portion of my adult life in the academic study of English literature and, for me, there is no more painful\u2014and painfully obvious\u2014proof of the intellectual hegemony of science than how the disciplines of the humanities have been forced to adopt a language of empiricism in order to talk about their own value. If you want to do a Ph.D. on, say, the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop, you will need to be able to talk about what you\u2019re doing as though it were a kind of science. What you\u2019re doing is \u201cresearch,\u201d and that research has to be pursued through the use of some or other \u201cmethodology.\u201d In order to get funding for that research, you\u2019ll need to establish how it will advance the existing body of knowledge on Bishop\u2019s poetry, and how it will \u201cimpact\u201d upon the wider public sphere. The study of the humanities, in other words, very often has to present itself as a kind of minor subsidiary of science.", "This is just one, fairly specific, form of the devaluation of the humanities in an efficiency economy. Scientism is essentially the belief, the faith, that all problems and questions are potentially soluble by empirical investigation (and that if they\u2019re not, they\u2019re somehow not real questions, not real problems). But there are large areas of human experience for which science has no convincing or compelling means of accounting. I am, I suppose, more or less an atheist, but when I read the Book of Genesis, I find that there is something profoundly true about the picture of human nature in those verses\u2014a picture of our perversity and self-alienation that neuroscience, for instance, has no way of getting at or talking about. Schopenhauer, Freud, and Heidegger all give us comparable forms of truth\u2014truths that aren\u2019t verifiable or measurable in the same way as those of science, but that are no less valuable.

But my school did have its share of professors rumored to dabble in their students.

Except that Heidegger became a Nazi, and Arendt seemed to excuse this\u2014a bit of forgiveness that has inspired a lot of scholarly infighting about whether she was lovesick or in some way morally compromised herself.

In Lott\u2019s, the student-professor couple reunite many years on. They are, for the most part, very different books. Choi\u2019s is, not surprisingly, the far more accomplished of the two. But they have one rather telling similarity: Both books seem ultimately uncomfortable with the very subject they have taken on\u2014as though their authors are ultimately unwilling to confront the thicket of moral issues such relationships raise.", "Both Choi and Lott tweak their premises like lawyers, as though trying to distinguish their case from precedent.

This is not true only of Nate and Hannah, who suppress the parts of their personalities they don\u2019t like; Nate has two polar-opposite friends, the male chauvinist Jason and the stridently pro-woman Aurit, who go to great lengths to concoct theoretical grounds for the way they treat the opposite sex.
