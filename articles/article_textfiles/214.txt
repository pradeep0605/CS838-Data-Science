{"Body": ["Illustration by Jon Chadurjian.", ", by the Japanese novelist and scholar Minae Mizumura, has all the ingredients of a rage-read. Indeed, when it was published in Japan in 2008, it", ", who dismissed Mizumura as \u201creactionary,\u201d \u201cjingoistic,\u201d or \u201celitist\u201d and swarmed across Amazon deleting positive reviews. More than 65,000 copies have sold since then\u2014which suggests the slender work\u2019s declinist soothsaying continues to touch a nerve. The book appears this month in English (enemy territory!), where\u2014if we Yanks could be trusted to read something first penned in a non-Western tongue\u2014it would likely inspire more umbrage, more name-calling, more amorphous unease. The book\u2019s basic premise, developed in a sinuous line through seven chapters, is that every language creates and nourishes untranslatable truths. Dominant languages infuse their verities into the wider world, crowding out alternative visions from more minor tongues. Linguistic asymmetry isn\u2019t new\u2014over the past two centuries, Latin, classical Chinese, and French each took a turn in the sun\u2014but never has one language so completely eclipsed the rest, Mizumura says, as today, in the age of the Internet, with English.", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "And have you heard? English is a tuneless, careless juggernaut! English has a tendency to favor science over art, sound over image, market value over intrinsic cultural worth. (For Chrissake, English spawned", ", which Mizumura clearly wants to assign to everlasting torment in its own circle of hell.) Her disdain\u2014mostly implied, but sometimes explicit, as when she describes Americans as \u201cgrown tall and stout on too many hamburgers and French fries\u201d\u2014might lose Mizumura some Anglophone readers. But it shouldn\u2019t. Every writer need not love English, or English speakers. And we might benefit from attending to the critiques of someone who refuses to kiss the ring.", "You can find reasons to jump on the angry bandwagon: Mizumura\u2019s tone", "sound disagreeably peevish, bitter, or despairing; she doesn\u2019t bother disguising her scorn for the United States; nor does she shrink from dismissing the entire contemporary fiction scene in Japan as \u201cjust juvenile.\u201d (That last is what set off the initial batch of protests.) But these critiques come to feel superficial in the face of the book\u2019s lucidity, erudition, and force.", "Mizumura\u2019s first shrewd move is to start with a personal essay, which puts the book\u2019s center of gravity in a lyrical, literary space somewhere above all the consequent salvos of angry scholarship. (Since", "will go on to tease apart \u201cacademic\u201d and \u201cnovelistic\u201d truths, reserving more love and reverence for the latter, this is a wise call.) In \u201cUnder the Blue Sky of Iowa,\u201d she hangs a wreath of personal details on a monthlong international writers\u2019 conference. We learn of her addiction to Agatha Christie audiobooks and her poor health\u2014Mizumura suffers from \u201cautonomic dystonia,\u201d and envisioned her Iowa stay as a \u201cresort idyll\u201d where \u201cI could \u2026 spend my days reading and walking \u2026 letting my mind and body unwind in the tranquil flow of time.\u201d Most importantly, she arrives at the conference \u201cwith a hidden vow to keep my participation to a minimum.\u201d Isolating herself proves easier than expected, as few of the writers speak comfortable English (and none have fluent Japanese). The ghost of an allegory begins to emerge from Mizumura\u2019s careful descriptions of the blue sky, the yellowing leaves, the authors passing each other wordlessly in the halls at night, unable to communicate. She imagines them hunched over their computers, scoring thoughts to the faint music of their own language. \u201cI grew more and more haunted by the idea that we might be a group of people headed for a downfall,\u201d she writes. The participants represent a prism of different tongues, but \u201cin the sense that we might be headed for a downfall, we were all the same.\u201d", "Languages have materiality, Mizumura insists, and her personal essay-cum-allegory lets the landscape of English letters hover like a mirage above physical America. In Iowa \u201cthe view was not particularly beautiful. There was none of the poetry one sees in scenes of the countryside in American films.\u201d Yet \u201cturning to Chris [the program director], I roused myself and said exactly what an American might say at such a moment: \u2018Beautiful day!\u2019 \u201d Such are the dangers of a universal language: Being in America, speaking \u201cAmerican,\u201d Mizumura can utter only \u201cwhat an American might say,\u201d even if that means lying about the blighted prospect around her. In contrast, here is the author\u2019s memory of touching down in France: \u201cOnce I set foot in Paris, I was greeted with boulevards shimmering with new leaves and skies gloriously liberated from the dark of winter.\u201d", "I mention France because the French language\u2014all libert\u00e9 and illumination\u2014is one of Mizumura\u2019s sanctuaries, a spiritual alternative to English. (It is also a scholarly alternative: Though she doesn\u2019t mention him outright, Mizumura, who studied French literature at Yale during its Structuralist heyday, is clearly indebted to", ", one of the first to propose that meaning arises from closed linguistic systems. Saussure wrote in French.) Her family moved from Japan to New York when she was 12, and she \u201cstubbornly resisted getting along either with the United States or the English language,\u201d instead soaking in French audiobooks on repeat in her room. What draws Mizumura to the lingua franca of the Enlightenment is its beauty, but also its predicament: Once the embodiment of the \u201csoul of Europe,\u201d a standard-bearer for the humanities, the expressive Play-Doh for writers like Voltaire and Diderot is now in the same lamentable position as Japanese. Which is to say, French and Japanese speakers are confined to the particular, while English speakers live in the universal.", "A writer writing in English can count on her words reaching people all over the world, whether in translation or the original, but there\u2019s no guarantee English-speaking readers will ever encounter experiences first framed in Japanese. Nor can bilingual writers just switch to English: Even if the West does not seem \u201ctoo far, psychologically as well as geographically,\u201d a sense of romance surrounds novels written in the novelist\u2019s mother tongue, making fiction formulated from a second language less palatable. So, Mizumura concludes, non-English speakers \u201ccan only participate passively in the universal temporality \u2026 they cannot make their own voices heard.\u201d Discouraged by the deafness of the world\u2014even as Internet fans sing about our increasing connectedness\u2014they might decide to stop writing altogether.", "The French language\u2014all libert\u00e9 and illumination\u2014is one of Mizumura\u2019s sanctuaries, a spiritual alternative to English.", "When writers stop writing in a language, that language decays. People lose faith in its ability to bear the burden of their fine feeling and entrust their most important thoughts elsewhere. Raging against the decline of \u201clesser\u201d lexicons, Mizumura is stressing more than the loss of cultural artifacts, or the value of diversity for its own sake. Non-dominant tongues must live on, she warns, because \u201cthose of us \u2026 living in asymmetry are the only ones condemned to perpetually reflect upon language, the only ones forced to know that the English language cannot dictate \u2018truths\u2019 and that there are other \u2018truths\u2019 in this world.\u201d Buried in that argument is an oddly touching one about the nature of literature: \u201cThe writer must see the language not as a transparent medium for self-expression or the representation of reality, but as a medium one must struggle with to make it do one\u2019s bidding.\u201d", "I\u2019m not sure if I share Mizumura\u2019s pessimism regarding the transfer of meaning between tongues\u2014I\u2019m no Saussurean, and while maybe our \u201crice\u201d can\u2019t capture the mythical freight of the Japanese \u201cine,\u201d I tend to think sensitive and knowledgeable workarounds can go a long way. (For example, Mizumura seems to underestimate the power of a good translator, which is a shame given the lovely translation given her by Mari Yoshihara and Juliet Winters Carpenter.) But I do believe that writers should be wrestling with words, rather than deploying them thoughtlessly. And I\u2019m ready to stand behind any author who is (rudely, furiously) urging us all to the mat.", "Some of the deepest pleasures in", "lie in Mizumura\u2019s historical analysis. She attacks the (Western) premise that written language merely represents spoken language, pointing out that most people into modernity yelled at their kids in local dialect while reading and writing (if they were literate) in an \u201cexternal\u201d tongue. This \u201cuniversal\u201d language usually belonged to an older, grander civilization, like Rome or classical China; to it were entrusted the texts that embodied intellectual, aesthetic, or ethical excellence. Yet as mass printing transformed books into commodities, the market for works in the elite language was soon saturated. A cadre of bilinguals began to translate them into the vernacular, devising grammar rules as they went. With the glories of the \u201cuniversal\u201d libraries being gradually emptied into these fledging tongues, the tongues themselves were elevated. They began to circulate as something more\u2014national languages\u2014suited not just to huge themes but to the fleeting dreams and textures of everyday life. Mizumura traces how the myth of the \u201cnational language,\u201d a pure upwelling of political character, coincided with the flowering of the nation-state\u2014and, even more fascinatingly, of the novel itself. To her, it is no coincidence that literature began to aim at new forms of self-expression just as common people were developing an argot that could swing from God to the gutter, and the written mediums for scientific learning were growing more receptive to questions of humanistic truth.", "At some point in all this, you realize: \u201cLanguage\u201d may be in the book\u2019s title, but Mizumura has really crafted a conservationist\u2019s plea for", ". Discussing the golden age of Japanese modernist fiction, she introduces us to Natsume Soseki, who penned the novel", "in 1909, 41 years after the Meiji Restoration opened Japan to the West. In an early scene, the na\u00efve student Sanshiro meets a shabby man on a university-bound train; he is Professor Hirota, a liberal arts scholar specializing in English, and he informs Sanshiro that their homeland \u201cis headed for a fall.\u201d Hirota, steeped in lettered arcana, knows all there is to know about the Western canon. But his learning lies fallow\u2014he writes nothing, publishes nothing\u2014and his houseboy calls him \u201cthe Great Darkness\u201d for his ability to absorb the splendors of English literature without emitting any light of his own. The professor has failed the Japanese language, of course, in ways that are painfully relevant to Mizumura\u2019s argument. But the author also weaves in a stray detail: that, over the course of their conversation on the train, Hirota unfolds for Sanshiro \u201cthe curious story of Leonardo da Vinci injecting arsenic into the trunk of a peach tree experimentally, to see if the poison would circulate to the fruit.\u201d", "Who says \"It's a beautiful day\" on a consistent basis? \u00a0Who is forced into saying it here in the US?", "", "-DukeLaw", "", "", "", "I have no idea why Mizumura airdrops this quoted anecdote into her book\u2014the sentence ends and she never remarks on it again. Still, it\u2019s striking. As a description of a scientific investigation, the story means one thing. As a capsule of literary truth\u2014the kind of spectral allegory Mizumura conjures with her opening essay\u2014it feels almost unbearably alive with import. Even without the Western interplay of trees, wisdom, and death, Hirota\u2019s \u201ccurious\u201d tale\u2014flowing here from Europe to Japan to the United States\u2014captures something real about ambition, curiosity, courage, and cruelty; about alluring goals and bitter aftertastes; about connection, circulation, and disjuncture. It rewards a literary way of thinking one hundredfold. And I felt that, if Mizumura is right that literature demands us to be conscious of the particular language we\u2019re manipulating, and that such consciousness cannot exist without linguistic diversity, we should perhaps be devoting more of our lives to protecting linguistic diversity. (Or \u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u591a\u69d8\u6027\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77\u306b\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u6367\u3052\u308b.) As she writes, the same polyphonic jostle of tongues that \u201ccondemns\u201d us to \u201creflect perpetually upon language,\u201d and upon literature, has a singular power to leave us \u201chumble, and mature, and wise.\u201d", "---", "by Minae Mizumura.
