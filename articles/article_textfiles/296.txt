{"Body": ["Simon Roy", "If you were a British teenager on fire with the love of art at the turn into the 19", "century, there was only one thing to be: a Romantic. Thomas De Quincey was just such a teenager when he discovered William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s", "a salvo fired against the ornate, figurative, refined style that dominated English poetry. Its characters were humble people, children, and vagrants, and it ended with the long, weird, visionary tale of a sailor whose crime in shooting a lucky seabird condemns his shipmates and himself to roam cursed seas.", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "At 16, De Quincey, still high on the experience of reading", "speculated in his diary about the sort of man he\u2019d shortly become. \u201cWhat shall be my character?\u201d he asked, \u201cwild \u2014 impetuous \u2014", "sublime? dignified \u2014 melancholy \u2014", "sublime? or shrouded in mystery \u2014 supernatural \u2014 like the \u2018ancient mariner\u2019 \u2014", "sublime?\u201d Sublimity, which to the Romantics meant a rough, awestriking type of beauty, was a given. De Quincey would go on to become one of the chief memoirists of an autobiography-mad age, and his most famous work,", "would launch an entirely new branch of the genre, the addiction memoir. His lush, feverish prose style and Gothic preoccupations would make his work an inspiration and touchstone for writers ranging from Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Baudelaire to Jorge Luis Borges. But for the adolescent De Quincey in 1801, only one writer really mattered, and as Frances Wilson's vivid new biography,", "demonstrates, his obsession would be both the making and the breaking of his art.", "So much has been written about the Romantics in the past 200 years that they can seem remote and dust-covered, the pet subjects of scholars whose work went out of fashion a century ago. But those lines from De Quincey\u2019s diary punch through layers of dissertations and monographs to a reality anyone can related to: a dreamy adolescent contemplating possible identities the way you\u2019d try on several pairs of sneakers. In the same diary, De Quincey wrote of icily shutting down the conversational forays of a couple of older gentlemen he\u2019d once found good company; the dolts failed to appreciate the revolutionary importance of his idols. While he was sulking and fantasizing, De Quincey was also carefully crafting a fan letter to Wordsworth, the first stage in an ambitious plan to become the poet's friend, much as later generations of kids would turn up on Kurt Cobain\u2019s doorstep.", "Wilson, who wrote an award-winning biography of Dorothy Wordsworth (the poet\u2019s sister), makes De Quincey a character so immediate you half expect him to materialize. The book would explode in a cloud of fluttering, perfumed pages, and the diminutive (he stood at 4 foot 11 inches) writer would step forth, shake your hand, and hit you up for a loan. Wordsworth, despite the rockiness of their relationship in years to come, maintained that everything De Quincey wrote was worth reading. (This meant a lot coming from the egotistical Wordsworth, although he might ultimately have revised that opinion in light of the tell-all \u201csketches\u201d a hard-up De Quincey would later publish on the \u201cdaily life and habits\u201d of the poet and his circle.) But", "is short on literary analysis and long on dish; Wilson spends more words on De Quincey\u2019s epic, late-life financial woes than on the", "themselves. (At one point, De Quincey\u2019s indebtedness attained a level so fantastical that he had to go into hiding when he was sued by Holyrood Abbey, Edinburgh\u2019s famed debtor\u2019s sanctuary.) Her De Quincey is more literary character than literary figure.", "So is her Wordsworth, and her account of the shifting relationship between De Quincey and his idol, who stood ramrod straight at the center of a circle of poets and writers who transformed English literature, is irresistible. During the first two decades of the 19", "century, most of them, following Wordsworth, lived in or around the small rural town of Grasmere in England\u2019s Lake District. To the true Romantic, this heady society became the subject of intense fascination. Every idealized literary scene that has followed it, from the Bloomsbury Group to the Beats, has been, consciously or unconsciously, modeled after it. As soon as the teenage De Quincey learned that his heroes had congregated in the Lake District, he resolved to go there and insinuate himself into their ranks. That\u2019s where he was heading when he ran away from school in 1802, but he lost his nerve and headed to London instead, thinking he could live on borrowings against an eventual inheritance. He was wrong about that, and De Quincey spent the better part of a year living on the streets, befriending the young prostitute he describes so heartrendingly in", "Or did he? The girl might never have existed. De Quincey, especially on the topic of himself, was the ultimate unreliable narrator. Even the title of", "is misleading. He didn\u2019t eat opium; he drank it, in the form of laudanum. But eating it sounded so much more exotically transgressive\u2014laudanum was widely prescribed to all sorts of prosaic Britons. De Quincey was a man prone to emotional extremes, from wracking dread to otherworldly ecstasy, and his device of choice was hyperbole; he once described his guilt over his opium binges as having \u201cthe weight of twenty Atlantics.\u201d \u201cLife for De Quincy,\u201d Wilson writes, \u201cwas either angels ascending on vaults of cloud or vagrants shivering on the city streets. It was being earthbound that he found hardest to describe.\u201d", "Biographies tend to be about extraordinary people: It\u2019s the rarity of their experiences and achievements that makes them interesting. Novels, on the other hand, work better when the central characters are closer to average, when we can see our own lot reflected in theirs. Memoirs fall somewhere in between, which is also where De Quincey dwells. Certainly, he was an influential writer, well-thought-of by his peers. But when De Quincey wormed his way into the life of William Wordsworth, he found himself surrounded by bona fide geniuses: not just Wordsworth himself and Coleridge, but also the great essayist William Hazlitt. In a scenario more than a little reminiscent of", "De Quincey made himself indispensable, playing secretary and sounding board, performing helpful tasks and playing with Wordsworth\u2019s children. It was a situation almost guaranteed to lead an ambitious and self-absorbed man to disillusionment and resentment.", "Johnathan Ring", "De Quincey had also stepped into a domestic situation of near-quantum complexity. The Wordsworths\u2014a peculiar triangular unit that included the poet, his wife, and his sister, to whom he was exceptionally close\u2014considered Coleridge\u2019s wife shallow. Throughout much of this period, Coleridge stayed with the Wordsworths while his wife and children lived in another house in the area. Then he fell madly in love with Wordsworth\u2019s sister-in-law, an unruly passion that would eventually drive the poor woman to the brink of a nervous breakdown. Coleridge himself was an opium addict, which made him just about the worst houseguest of all time. He slept all day and woke up the household in the middle of the night, to the disgust of the sober Wordsworth. While De Quincey was still making himself agreeable in Grasmere, many in the circle, Wilson speculates, imagined that he might marry Dorothy Wordsworth. Instead he became infatuated with a poor, barely educated farmer\u2019s daughter, got her pregnant, and did the right thing by marrying her. The Wordsworths, who prided themselves on their egalitarian views, were nevertheless shocked by the match and snubbed her, alienating De Quincey.", "And so on and so on. Much of", "resembles Sally Wainwright\u2019s brilliant Yorkshire-set family drama", ", if, in between the intrigues and melodrama, all the characters went off into the corner for a bit to write towering masterpieces of English literature. De Quincey\u2019s own daughter described him as an \u201cextreme mixture of childish folly joined to a great intellect,\u201d and while that formula doesn\u2019t fit everyone milling around Grasmere in the 1810s, it nevertheless captures what makes accounts of the Lake Poets so habit-forming: the alternately amusing and appalling blend of Romantic grandeur and human folly.", "Eventually, disenchanted, De Quincey decamped for London, Edinburgh, and other locales. Often he\u2019d fill up his current quarters with books and papers to the degree that they became uninhabitable, then move someplace new. He was often severely broke, at one point writing to an editor to say that he was unable to leave the house to file a piece because he had sold all of his shoes. Wilson considers De Quincey to have been addicted not only to opium but to books and to the debt that financed both habits, but he was also, clearly, a hoarder.", "To pay (sort of) for all of this, De Quincey worked as a journalist in one of the liveliest markets the profession has ever seen.

In a late-life assessment of his years in Grasmere, De Quincey offered this sagacious advice: \u201cPut not your trust in the intellectual princes of your age.\u201d It is \u201csafer to scrutinize the words of eminent poets than long to connect yourself with themselves.\u201d The road to the sublime, alas, almost always features extensive travel through the realms of the ridiculous.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
