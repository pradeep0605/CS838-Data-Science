{"Body": ["Illustration by Chip Zdarsky", "On a bright and blustery morning in February, I stepped out my front door and walked until I reached the north bank of the River Liffey, where I crossed a bridge and stopped in front of a dark gaunt house on Usher\u2019s Island. The house stood a little back from the street, as though in quiet reproach of its surroundings, the only Georgian redbrick in a row of humbler buildings facing the river; it was flanked squatly on one side by a small car upholstery concern, and, on the other, by a large modern block of apartments. The windows of this dark gaunt house were opaque with brownish grime from the heavy traffic along the south quays, but in one of the dim street-level rooms I could make out the looming profile of a massive papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head, perhaps 3 feet high. The sheer slope of the nose, terminating in a trim gray mustache; the almost comic nobility of the chin; the gigantic fedora overmastering a high forehead: It was instantly apparent whom this cartoon head was intended to represent.

The house is available for private functions, including wakes.

You see women in voluminous Edwardian dress, middle-aged men in ill-fitting white seersucker and straw boat hats, clusters of gussied-up", "enthusiasts standing around nibbling Gorgonzola sandwiches in tribute to the gustatory preferences of Mr. Leopold Bloom. All over the city, in locations that feature in the novel\u2014the National Library, Sandymount Strand, Glasnevin Cemetery, all largely unchanged since Joyce\u2019s time\u2014people read the passages that pertain to those places. The whole merry rigmarole happens on this date because Joyce set his book not just on \u201ca summer\u2019s day,\u201d but on this particular one. And he did so in order to commemorate his first date with Nora, rescheduled from June 14, the evening they walked together to Ringsend and, as he made a point of reminding her in one of his letters, \u201cyou slid your hand down inside my trousers and pulled my shirt softly aside and touched my prick with your long tickling fingers and gradually took it all, fat and stiff as it was, into your hand and frigged me slowly until I came off through your fingers, all the time bending over me and gazing at me out of your quiet saintlike eyes.\u201d", "And so it is that every June 16, the city of Dublin, the capital of the unfortunate priest-ridden state that refused to repatriate Joyce\u2019s profane body after his death, commemorates with all the convivial pomp of a religious festival or a historical reconstruction the occasion of the furtive outdoor handjob he later referred to as a sacrament. This can only really be seen as a measure of the wicked genius of James Joyce, whom the chorus girls of Zurich would later come to know as \u201cHerr Satan.\u201d", "And I can\u2019t tell you how weird it is to me, how beautiful in a way, that the city I live in\u2014that I, like most Dubliners, love and deplore, and that I can\u2019t stop thinking about and don\u2019t know how to write about\u2014has an annual festival that, whether it wants to admit it or not, marks the occasion of a specific ejaculation. Because it seems to me to encapsulate with a sort of dreamlike accuracy the nature of the relationship between this city and its most famously wayward son, which was one of frustrated love. Part of his great and endless gift to his home was the creative act of sinning against it, of transgressing against the narrowness and piety of its poor stunted houses. He showed Dublin to itself and to the world, but he also made it what it is: for better or worse, Joyce\u2019s city.", "---", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
