(Weren\u2019t we all in those innocent days?)", "Over the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed the vulnerability one feels writing fiction, the arrogance of male critics, and why she doesn\u2019t have a smartphone.", "", "I don\u2019t think it has changed, but the word is used in two different ways. The first is a kind of ideological principle, and the second is just a descriptive fact. I\u2019ve always dealt with it as a descriptive fact. On the right in England, it\u2019s considered some kind of subterranean policy, but I consider it a consequence of things like airplanes and global travel.", "I\u2019ve never understood the argument about reversing or pulling back from something which is a geographical, social, and historical fact.

I don\u2019t accept the initial premise. Do you see what I mean? If you engage with it, then you\u2019re engaged with the idea that the only peaceful way of life is homogeneity. I think that is historically delusional and inaccurate.", "[I know] that\u2019s not what you mean. Yes, people are trying to reverse a mixed situation. What kind of reversal can we possibly be talking about, literal repatriation, is that where we\u2019re heading?", "Yeah. It is. Obviously I feel sad. What other feeling is there to have? I also have some faith in Britain as a very mature parliamentary democracy and as we see already brakes are being put on. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a fatalist.", "Well, you know it\u2019s different to be 41 than 24, for sure. Life is facing in one direction, to one place. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any novelist, or any artist, that doesn\u2019t experience that feeling. You are death-facing: That\u2019s just a fact. Particularly when you have children, you are now what\u2019s between them and death. You change positions. I think that\u2019s just an existential fact that can\u2019t be avoided. But I do feel, as I think people do feel when they\u2019re up against it, that you get tired of trying to represent your people to other people, and expect their sympathy and understanding. At a certain point you just want to defend your people for yourself and for them, and become less externally facing because there doesn\u2019t seem to be so much point. I feel like the Black Lives Matter movement is part of that reradicalization of the civil rights movement, saying, \u201cWe are our people and we will protect our people.\u201d", "It is, but it\u2019s also a movement of a certain amount of aggression, a certain militancy, which we haven\u2019t seen in the world.

The civil rights movement is always moving between the Martin position and the Malcolm position and right now we\u2019re in a Malcolm moment. I think it\u2019s a good thing.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a particularly political person. I don\u2019t have a political intelligence. My husband\u2019s like that, I have lots of friends like that, but I\u2019m not a political animal. When I\u2019m looking around, I\u2019m thinking intimately about people\u2019s intimate life. That\u2019s my business.

That\u2019s what I think.\u201d", "I think the pessimism, if there is one, it\u2019s just as you get older it becomes more and more obvious to you that life is not a perfected art. It\u2019s not that generation after generation everybody improves and becomes better, but that you move in these constant cycles. Something I\u2019ve found personally and maybe it has some resonance politically is that progress is never permanent. That goes for the welfare state, that goes for personal progress in your life. You have to be continually reclaimed, restated, reargued.", "It is a fact, but under these new terms we have to make a case again for things like universal education, health care, welfare. You have to restate the case. Although again I feel myself to be a bit of a political dunce; you can\u2019t really do it by just repeating the pieties of the \u201970s, the ones I grew up with. As much as I love them and grew up within them, I think you have to find a new response to new circumstance. I don\u2019t know who that would be in England. We have to wait for that person to arrive.", "He\u2019s perfectly placed.", "What interests me, which probably doesn\u2019t interest other people, is the children. I\u2019m going to talk in a generalization. When people are children of narcissists, and there are multiple children, they usually bond together against the narcissist. But when you have a lot of money, as Trump does, that seems to skew the whole thing. What I find so painful is the idea of children competing for the affection of a narcissist, whose affection they will never receive. That seems to me just excruciating. That\u2019s what boggles my mind: Reading interviews with them where they boast about who gets to call him in his office more regularly or who saw him more than four times during their childhood. It\u2019s so sad, that part. It\u2019s slightly unbearable. Also because if the children don\u2019t correct the narcissist, he goes to his grave never knowing. I think that\u2019s the kind of man he is, right? He\u2019ll never know.", "But even with the children of a dictator there\u2019s usually one who turns. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything like this. Maybe just to be told you are the prettiest is enough from this kind of parent.", "Uh, no.", "That might be a credit to her. She might be person enough to not be caricatured by a comic novelist like me.", "I live here \u2026 and I am American in all purposes except I have a green card so I can\u2019t vote. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll become a citizen. I was talking to another writer this weekend, Hari Kunzru. He\u2019s like me. I think we both always thought of England as home. We\u2019ll go home and be very nostalgic about home. When the country you come from changes so radically as it has recently, it\u2019s just a strange immigrant experience. Not that I will ever move home, but you feel like now I have no two homes. I\u2019m not at home in two places. It\u2019s a weird feeling. Maybe it\u2019ll change again, but yeah it\u2019s strange.", "As soon as the kids come out of school, June 16 whatever, we go to England and see my family and his family and the kids see their cousins, and we come back the day before school starts. I go as an outsider. It\u2019s compounded not just by not being there but by the time passing. You\u2019re already nostalgic as someone who\u2019s now, whatever, 25 years older. When I\u2019m there in the summer, it\u2019s so beautiful, England in the summer. My children love it so much and all our family are there, so it has a kind of idyllic tone, but I know that\u2019s not the same as England in February and all year round.", "Because of what I said before, because of that mature parliamentary democracy and because I have so many friends there who I know are working on the side of good, I\u2019m not that pessimistic. I think there\u2019s only so far Britain can go wrong. I guess I\u2019ve had that sense since I was a kid. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, and it could fall straight into some.", "Right now. Right. Exactly. No, I\u2019ve never felt this way. Never. I was saying that to Nick this morning. I\u2019ve never had the feeling, certainly not in Europe, even when I lived in Italy under Berlusconi, I\u2019ve never had a feeling like I have about tomorrow.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of opinion. What else could you call yourself? I know artists sometimes think they\u2019re exempt somehow because they\u2019re artists, but I think that\u2019s a crock of shit.", "", "I see what you mean. You could absolutely call me upper-middle class, or whatever you want to call me. I just meant that for me working-class life is a daily experience and once you\u2019re removed from it \u2026 people in England feel differently. They feel like it\u2019s a mark of birth, and it\u2019s never removed. \u00a0I was born working class, but I\u2019m not working class anymore.", "Yeah, but I don\u2019t mind that. I think it\u2019s just different stages of life, like the kind of young angry man criticism that you write when you\u2019re straight out of college and a young man.", "It\u2019s good that that stuff happens. Somebody has to walk in and say, \u201cThis is absolute shit.\u201d Separating wheat from chaff with that kind of venom is completely appropriate for the young boy with a pen who wants to make a name for himself. I guess as I\u2019ve got older, and with the more novels I write, I\u2019ve gone soft from that boy\u2019s opinion because I know what it takes to write a novel. There are plenty of novels I absolutely hate, but it\u2019s no longer of interest to me to publicly destroy them. I know how much it hurts, and I just can\u2019t do it.", "I still think of criticism as a beautiful and intelligent way of describing the lay of the land. When I write criticism now, I do tend to write about things I love just because I\u2019m more motivated by that. Hate is not enough for me anymore. It doesn\u2019t give me the requisite energy to write 5,000 words. It really has to be adoration, I guess. But I do feel when I am writing criticism that I am much more defended, sure. I can be cool in criticism, and I can be right, which is a great joy, whereas in fiction you can only be variously vulnerable. There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect novel, and you\u2019ll always look the fool in some proportion, and also you\u2019ll always reveal yourself in a way that is kind of horrifying. I can tell from somebody\u2019s sentence the type of person they are and that\u2019s the risk with a novel. With criticism it\u2019s all much more disguised.", "I teach great novels so that makes life much easier. There are no novels in the course that are not great novels, in my opinion, and I guess I take my opinion quite seriously when it comes to other people\u2019s fiction.", "You can of course decide that you don\u2019t like Kafka, you just find him boring. But I can still show you the way these stories work, their operations, and I still know that will be good for you, even if you dislike him. It\u2019s like bad-tasting medicine or whatever.", "Before I start a course each January, I think,", "I get anxious. Then once we\u2019re in full swing, it\u2019s always good. There\u2019s always one very, very bright kid and then there\u2019s lots of really good kids. There\u2019s always one extremely bright kid. I don\u2019t know how I would get that otherwise in my life, with two small children, and mostly a domestic life. Having that conversation every Monday and Tuesday with 12 19- and 20-years-olds has been extremely useful for me. I hope it\u2019s been useful for them too.", "They do that anyway in America! They fill out forms. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a very good teacher, but I mean well is all I can say.", "Ages.", "I think male critics would like to believe that, wouldn\u2019t they? Particularly with girl writers\u2014that they\u2019re constantly correcting them and improving them. What do I think now? Personally I think that to write", "at 21 is not too shabby, actually. That\u2019s what I think.", "\u201cThe way that male critics write about women is part romantic, part corrective, part, \u2018now listen young lady.\u2019 \u201d", "Whether it was good or bad or whatever, I was a kid and I\u2019m proud of it. When I look back, it feels like a different lifetime and I can\u2019t imagine how it was written, but I\u2019m glad of it. I never did disagree with James\u2019 criticism, but the one thing I do feel is that there is sometimes, not with James really, but certain attitudes amongst male critics that they think perhaps I am vulnerable or unsure of myself. I genuinely believe in change in prose. I want it. That kind of restlessness is what makes me continue. Not liking something I did before is just a way of saying it\u2019s now time for a change. That\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always operated. I kind of like it.", "To me, when you think of painters, you don\u2019t find it at all surprising that they have periods, right? Abstract periods, figurative periods. That\u2019s how I think of writing. I want it that way. The idea that I am ... I don\u2019t know. The way that male critics write about women is always a little funny. It\u2019s part romantic, part corrective, part, \u201cnow listen young lady.\u201d", "I think they can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s just so deep in our dynamic, in the culture. In middle age you just have a certain comfort in yourself and you just start moving in your own way. I\u2019m quite determined in my own way.", "I\u2019m about to write about her new book. I admire her enormously, and I had no interest from the start, nor did anybody, who really writes, I think. Literally, I\u2019m not trying to be gauche: I do not understand the argument. It\u2019s like saying, who is Shakespeare? Shakespeare is whoever wrote all those plays. What more do you want to know? All that happened is that someone gave me a name that is not Elena Ferrante. Just in every other way it doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. I feel a kind of deep connection with the consciousness that wrote those books. I love that person, and I send her my love virtually, wherever she is. The rest of it is just nonsense to me. Literary gossip.", "This time I was thinking very particularly about black girls. I\u2019m very happy if other people read the book, but that\u2019s who the book is for explicitly, and that\u2019s who I wanted to write to.", "I did not read the article \u2026 but I obviously had heard about it. It\u2019s just a question of approach. I would not take Lionel\u2019s approach. I also think there\u2019s an enormous amount of pious cant spoken about it. I\u2019m almost never accused of cultural appropriation\u2014why not? Because I\u2019m brown and Bengalis are brown and so it\u2019s all the same to white people? It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s a kind of fake piety. I do resent the idea of being portrayed as such a vulnerable human that if you involved yourself in any aspect of my \u201cculture\u201d I will crumble at the idea of you borrowing it from me.", "The whole thing is told from a white perspective, which is completely annoying to me. In terms of things that I borrow, of course I use things all the time. I have absolutely no defense apart from I love and am curious about other people\u2019s lives and I am explicitly a voyeur. That\u2019s why I started writing: because I wanted to know what\u2019s it like to be a Jewish Chinese guy or an old black woman or a white professor or whatever. That is my absolute intention to get under the skin and do that. I can be wrong. People tell me I\u2019m wrong all the time. I get letters and people get grumpy, but that\u2019s the risk you take.", "Yeah. It\u2019s so easy just to fall through the gap because there\u2019s the lack of collective experience. I was making my children watch", "because Nick was out of the house so I could get away with it. It\u2019s a slightly terrible musical from the early \u201950s. In the middle of it, one of the characters leaves the family act and becomes a priest. My daughter said, \u201cWhat is a priest?\u201d I thought,", "I don\u2019t think so, just because you had a collective culture, the TV, but also our community, the church at the end of my road. You would\u2019ve known.", "It\u2019s like wow, that\u2019s a big gap, clearly that\u2019s a quite serious thing not to know at 7 that there has been, in fact, our whole society is founded on a faith that she only has the vaguest idea of. She\u2019d heard of Judaism just about, but that was it. That kind of thing is quite shocking to me. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s atomized. I have no answer. It\u2019s curious to me to watch it happening in my children. They\u2019re kind of piecing together a world. They can\u2019t even go through the record collection as we did and think,", "They only have this iTunes, which just seems to be a random collection of names and titles. There\u2019s no pictures, no context, no historical moment. It\u2019s so odd.", "I think it\u2019s superuseful. I remember when I was pregnant with my first child: I was at a book festival and a writer of my own age, who will remain nameless, sat opposite me and said, \u201cGod you\u2019re having a kid huh?\u201d It was a man. He said, \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to lose a lot of time and you must be worried about falling behind.\u201d I was about seven months pregnant, and I just had a sudden inspiration. I said, \u201cYeah I guess so\u201d and then, \u201cYou must be worried about just a complete lack of human experience that you\u2019re now going to be 40 and then 50.\u201d His face went so pale. It was a wonderful way to frighten him back.", "The honest truth is that Eliot wrote without children, Woolf wrote without children, Gertrude Stein, loads of people write extraordinary things without children so it\u2019s not any answer. Every life that you live will give material for fiction. But given that I do have children, it is that experience of just the simple thing of seeing life in the round. It\u2019s so dull to say that, but it is extraordinary to see your childhood replayed, refracted, to see yourself saying things your parents said, to be in this new relation to death.", "When I think of writers, I really love someone like Ursula Le Guin, who had three kids and lived an entirely domestic life. I feel her children in those books, I feel that the weight of it, her experience of being a girl, a woman, a mother, an old woman, it\u2019s almost overwhelming when you read her. I don\u2019t know, when I read Woolf, I love Woolf and I love Eliot, but they remained young women their whole lives. That\u2019s part of their genius. They had that pointed, critical perspective, which never faded.

I said to Nick, it can\u2019t be that all these novels are brilliant. I must be in a good mood. But I was really struck particularly by the women.
