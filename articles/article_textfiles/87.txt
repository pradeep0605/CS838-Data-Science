A variation on the wounded woman, she seems attractively damaged, except powerful, not mute. The messy woman does not wait for you to notice her but demands your attention.

(Often Havrilesky refers to herself in her answers: her past, or how she feels in the moment of response.) Elsewhere in the book, she compares her personality to an anchovy\u2014\u201coily, salty,\u201d or in human terms \u201cemotional, thoughtful, moody, obnoxious, demanding\u201d\u2014rather than a \u201csweeter, snackier\u201d Little Debbie.", "If these categories are meant to represent neutral types, they fail. Isn\u2019t it self-evidently better to be a radish than a potato? Who wants to be a potato?

One might also question whether creative brilliance has to go hand in hand with messiness\u2014aren\u2019t there plenty of calm, focused artists and disheveled, shallow normals out there? (I often suspect that I am an anxious normal; even if Polly might atomize that qualm with the glistening affirmation that my anxiety is a byproduct of my awesomeness, I\u2019m not convinced she\u2019d believe it.) But I\u2019m also making Havrilesky sound more insufferable than she is. She\u2019s not a first-person essayist reframing her weirdo habits and painful fallibilities as empowering virtues.

To start, she is officially anointed as an aspirational figure, someone qualified to instruct others. (This is very weird! We should be taking life advice from Mount Vesuvius?

They\u2019re the static ones, the relatively flattened deus ex machinas with consistent axioms and catchphrases.", "The conventional advice column is about gawking at car crashes, delighting in the contrast between the sensible advice giver and the insanities endured or perpetrated by the LW. But in the mythology of the wounded or messy woman, having the answers\u2014being fundamentally OK\u2014makes you less interesting. And in a typical Ann Landers scenario, the figure who compels all the drama and tension is not the columnist but the seeker\u2014the character in flux, awaiting transformation in a time of crisis.", "Maybe that\u2019s why Polly writes to one LW:", "Note the magic metaphor, and the informal emphatic signposting (\u201chere\u2019s the main thing\u2026\u201d) meant to drench what comes next in special meaning. Most importantly, Havrilesky levels the playing field, dismantling the traditional dynamic between advice giver and advice seeker. \u201cYou are where I am,\u201d she insists. But if that\u2019s so, what\u2019s the point of writing in? Don\u2019t agony aunts traditionally use their position of authority to clean up your life or inspire you toward self-improvement, not empower you to \u201cdo you\u201d in all your chaotic glory?", "In an era that is wholly fixated on identity\u2014as definitional and as a", "\u2014Polly peddles the fantasy that all you need to do to succeed is simply", ". \u201cBeyonc\u00e9,\u201d she pep-talks one LW, \u201cdoesn\u2019t tap into a higher quality of magic than you.\u201d Putting aside the indisputable fact that Beyonc\u00e9 has 1,000 times the magic of any mere mortal, such a sentence is the result of appointing the messy woman, with her ethos of perfect imperfection, the custodian of personal worth. It\u2019s a tautology: If you\u2019re dissatisfied enough to write to an advice columnist, you must be emotionally complicated and searching and sensitive, which means you are already magical. Should the complacent potatoes be worried? I bet Havrilesky would say they contain magic too. (", "she would write.", ") Yet in championing hot mess-ness as a superpower, Polly comes across as less democratic than she seems to want to be.", "Havrilesky is often grouped with Melissa Broder, the", "essayist and poet, an association both women have encouraged by", "But while they share a \u201cdon\u2019t pretend to shiny fakey happiness\u201d mindset, they also mark the two ends of the reactivity spectrum.

(\u201chow many licks does it take to get to the center of my core underlying issues,\u201d murmurs", ".) Havrilesky, on the other hand, is all fortissimo, flinging majuscules and exclamation points, telling LWs to weep and rage like Shakespearean heroes. She\u2019s an emotions maximalist. \u201cOnce you start accepting yourself in your self-talk, you may find yourself feeling overcome, literally bursting into tears,\u201d she writes to the woman who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know\u201d her own heart. \u201cTHAT IS A BEAUTIFUL FUCKING THING!\u201d In the foreword to", ", Havrilesky recalls replying to the editor who approached her about moving Ask Polly from the", "to", ": \u201cYou know my column is three thousand words long every week, and half of those words are fuck, right?\u201d", "But they have to be. Superlong, profanity-laced columns are, for Havrilesky, enactments of giving a shit. She wants you to care because when you care about things, you put in effort, and when you put in effort, you come alive:", ". To the LW who dreams of quitting her job and pursuing stand-up comedy, Polly advises: \u201cWhat matters is the feeling that you\u2019re doing it, every day. What matters is the work\u2014diving in, feeling your way in the dark, finding the words, trusting yourself, embracing your weird voice, celebrating your quirks on the page, believing in all of it.\u201d", "\" Rather than driving others away, perceived neurosis will draw in the world...\" Perceived neurosis makes me want to leave the area.", "", "", "", "", "I am not sure I believe in all of it. I think what passes for magic in Polly\u2019s world might be illusion and stagecraft rather than pure lava-bright enchantment, because sometimes your messy self, instead of liberating you, flings you against a wall. Still, there\u2019s something irresistible about Havrilesky\u2019s conviction to the contrary. We do want to believe that if we could only truly embody who we are, we could exhale flame and sorcery, and find out that nothing (besides superficial lifestyle flourishes) really separates us from Beyonc\u00e9. The conventional advice column is a hospital emergency room, where fools and victims rush in, mangled by life and their own mistakes, and conscientious professionals use agreed-upon standards to put them back together. Advice as practiced by the messy woman, though, more closely resembles therapy: a deep working through of vulnerabilities one yearns to see as universal, a sense that while the columnist appears to be addressing somebody else, she is really, magically, speaking directly to you.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
