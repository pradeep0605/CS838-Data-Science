{"Body": ["Illustration by Sam Alden", "Some months ago, in a foul and nidorous vault, seated at a stone table near a pool in which some strange writhing thing turned slowly in the quag, a murder of marketers made a blood pact. They vowed to keep the plot of", ", Lauren Owen\u2019s stunning debut novel, from the book-browsing public for as long as possible. As with", "and Haydn\u2019s \u201c", ",\u201d a surprise lurks within. But unlike those works, the surprise in", "changes entirely the", "of story it is, and they\u2014the marketers\u2014were betting that if you knew what it was beforehand, you might not pick up the book. Therefore: No mention of the secret appears in the blurbs or in the jacket copy, which present the novel as a Victorian thriller set in foggy Londontown.", "Here\u2019s the reason: The reader who will be drawn to the elegance of Owen\u2019s language and her novel\u2019s layered storyline is not the type of reader who will want to read what it\u2019s really about.", "What to do?", "If you\u2019re not too fancy for a little fantasy, well then skip the rest of this review and quick, go get", ".", "Well, if you want to persuade people to read the book, you don\u2019t let on. You talk around the story, not to it. You keep the secret", ". The publishers of", "got it. They knew that sooner rather than later the secret would get out, but they figured that by that time, readers would have generated enough heat to keep the novel afloat. They banked on those first readers falling so hard for the characters, that even when things took their turn, they\u2019d hang on for the long haul.", "And things do take a turn. And the publishers were right. People think they know what they want, but they don\u2019t! They don\u2019t know! You live your life, you get up and eat toast in the morning and go to work, you think you know what you want. And then, Lauren Owen comes along, puts all that stuff in a white glove, and slaps you across the face with it. You know nothing, sir! Nothing!", "This is all to say this: I\u2019m afraid that if I tell you what this novel is really about, you won\u2019t read it, thereby missing a big, sly bucketful of the most tremendous fun.", "I myself picked up", "for reasons ignoble: nice \u2019n thick; gaslit jacket art; slammin\u2019 blurb by Hilary Mantel, Her Majesty of All Things Excellent in a Novel, Historical. At first,", "seems like a really terrific, plain old tale of yesteryear\u2014\u00e0 la John Banville or Peter Carey or Eleanor Catton, wunderkind author of", ".", "Here\u2019s what happens in the droll and moving (by turns) first 100 pages: It\u2019s late in the Victorian era when James Norbury leaves his sister, Charlotte, at their family home to follow the muse poetic to London. He finds lodging, then love, and then", "\u2014he's gone.", "This summation, of course, doesn\u2019t speak to the heartbreaking poignancy of the love affair or to the deftness with which the sibling relationship is offered up, or to James\u2019 melancholy, bred in his bones. At a dinner party, Owen writes:", "Indeed, if I have a criticism of the book, it\u2019s that Owen rushes it a little\u2014these first hundred pages\u2014to get to what interests her more. Even so, as Part 1 ended, I was as pinned as a beetle in a cabinet of wonders.", "And then things took their turn. I fled to Facebook to whine.", "Generally, I like to find my horror in the world around me (war, melting ice caps, the NRA) rather than in my books. But I get it: Writers gonna write, and if you\u2019re hooked, you\u2019re gonna follow. So, I followed.", "And anyhow, listen: If you\u2019re too nice (in the Victorian sense) for fantasy, you\u2019ll miss out on Margaret Atwood\u2019s splendid", ". If you\u2019re too effete for fantasy, then nope, no", "for you. If you\u2019re too fancy for fantasy, well then you\u2019re in danger of living your life minus the supreme pleasure of Susanna Clarke\u2019s", "and Elizabeth Kostova\u2019s", ", which I read", "of a Mexican resort because I couldn\u2019t put it down. If you\u2019re not too fancy for a little fantasy, well then skip the rest of this review and quick, go get", ".", "Because it\u2019s at this point in the book that things begin to really rollick. The London-based Aegolius Club is not your average exclusive brandy-steeped, dark-paneled\u00a0gentleman's club, no indeed. Entrance to such a club as this requires a certain pallidness, an achromasia, a terrific effeteness peculiar to the very high-born undead. Here's where James ends up. And here's where his sister, Charlotte, rushes, unlikely hero that she is, to rescue him.", "Charlotte is awkward, self-conscious, hesitant, sweaty, respectable, and driven by a sort of Christian guilt to save her brother who, duh, can\u2019t be saved. (Or can he?) I\u2019ve always appreciated a good sister-champion; Charlotte is particularly appealing for her sense of mission and her quavering ladylike courage. Her internal observations make for some of the most slyly entertaining reading in", ". \u201cWealth instilled confidence, of course,\u201d she thinks, as a new acquaintance uses someone else\u2019s kitchen without asking. \u201cOne could make free with others\u2019 possessions then, because one would always be able to replace them, if necessary.\u201d", "Owen honed her ability at the adventure story while", ". She weaves what\u2019s here with what\u2019s beyond as easily as J.K. Rowling does, and as with Rowling, she seems to feel particularly at home with the beyond. Some readers will undoubtedly feel that they\u2019d rather wait to read Owen when she gets over her attraction to the supernatural, as Rowling has (for the moment, anyhow). But just like literary fiction, the world of fantasy has its hacks and its artists, and the task of a reader ought to be finding the artists, whatever they\u2019re writing about.", "Photo by Urszula Soltys", "For", ", Owen invented a whole society of fiends who dwell among us simpler, weaker, quick-blooded types (their supper). But, while all of Owen\u2019s monsters are of the Transylvanian variety, they're separated from each other by birth,\u00a0education, pocketbook. And let's just say that the effete Aegolians and the streetwise Alias don\u2019t exactly get along. Class warfare's generally good fun; in this particular case, it's a little hard to root for either of the fanged camps, as both would like to have Charlotte and her allies for their tea. A character called Doctor Knife is among the reasons for the extremity of their antipathy for each other. Doctor Knife is one of \u201cthe quick,\u201d that is, a regular old guy of the warm-blooded persuasion. But the Aegolians use him to do their research for them, and the Alia kids he takes as subjects, like urchin-bloodsucker Nick, whisper about him:", "Apparently, even the dead get creeped out.", "It\u2019s not uncommon for a debut writer to run amok toward her novel\u2019s conclusion, especially when things begin to rip and roar, but Owen remains in control of the action to the end\u2014which is particularly vital, as", "seems to be the beginning of something rather than a whole unto itself. Due to the fact that the first draft of the novel logged in at more than 1,000 pages, the publisher\u2019s given us only the first half of the manuscript. So the sequel's more than in the works.
