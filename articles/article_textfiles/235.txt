{"Body": ["Illustration by Roman Muradov", "Many writers have published their diaries. Far fewer have published diaries about their diaries, as Sarah Manguso has done with her new book,", ". A poet turned memoirist, Manguso has spent 25 years compulsively creating a life record of 800,000 words and counting. Her 2008 memoir,", ", was about her struggles with an autoimmune disease but really about how we write about disease. Her 2012 book", "was about grieving the suicide of her friend but really about how we write about grief. Her work is characterized by a tough, lyrical self-scrutiny: an eye trying, at times exhaustingly, to look at itself. And now in", "a meditation on diary keeping, she has turned her interest in writing about writing inside out.", "Manguso calls her diary \u201cthe only thing I ever wrote that wasn\u2019t for an audience,\u201d but at least in part, it is certainly for an audience now. Her diary has intense personal importance: In the afterword\u2014notes about notes about notes!\u2014she calls it \u201cthe writing that stands in for my entire self.\u201d And although the book is subtitled", ", Manguso\u2019s \u201cgraphomania\u201d continues apace. She\u2019s so helplessly compelled to self-document that even the prospect of not writing releases a floodgate of words.", "As someone who edits and writes on the Internet for a living, I can sympathize both with the fervent diary keeping and with the diarist\u2019s desire to stop. I find the idea of writing 800,000 words about myself ridiculous, and then I remember that I recently", "3,000 first-person words about getting an IUD. The quotidian zoom lens of the diary is the same that marks many of the essays that fill my inbox every day. It can feel tiresome, self-obsessed. Gradually I\u2019ve come to mistrust the isolated daily experience as a source of profound insight: How much meaning can be wrung out of an afternoon? Not a lot, usually. But the potential for performance", "is always there. And this tension between performance and real reflection is what drives, and drags down, Manguso\u2019s book.", "Manguso\u2019s absent diary is the sad song that the artist writes another song about, crooning at the audience about how she doesn\u2019t want to sing sad songs anymore.", "is about as analog as it gets\u2014a slim volume of windy musings on memory and time, pegged to nothing outside of Manguso\u2019s own head. But, now that writing about yourself is a common activity for both writers and well-adjusted people alike, the question of how to do so with sufficient self-awareness has become a constant hum.", "feels both quaintly distant from the Internet and like a creature of it: It lands at a moment when public self-documentation is a national pastime, while the instincts behind it\u2014self-indulgence and self-exposure\u2014have become a great source of collective anxiety and shame.", "The goal of Manguso\u2019s writing seems to be to, as she wrote in", ", \u201ccomprehend the dimensions of the self.\u201d More specifically, she wants to enlarge it. Self-diminishment is not part of Manguso\u2019s work. She tries to balance the weight of her own consciousness with a spare lyric style, which recalls fellow genre-blurrers Maggie Nelson and Eula Biss: a manner that is at once associative and direct. Conveniently for Manguso, this prose style inherently resembles the diary. And, as with any diary, her diary about diary keeping begins with a statement of intent:", "Nor, apparently, could she face her record without recording thoughts about her record keeping. This is clearly a common anxiety: If you search Twitter for \u201cmy twitter is\u201d you can watch this instinct play out in real time: \u201cmy twitter is boring", "\u201d", "my twitter is why no one likes me", "\u201d", "my twitter is gonna get so boring if I ever fall in love", "\u201d But in Manguso\u2019s case, the diary itself never appears.", "Instead, she writes around it. \u201cImagine [the diary] as dark matter or as one of the sixty-seven confirmed moons of Jupiter or whatever real thing you nonetheless must take on faith,\u201d she tells us, at the end of the afterword. Dark matter! A moon of Jupiter! It\u2019s all lovely sounding, though the more precise analogy may be a musical one: Manguso\u2019s absent diary is the sad song that the artist writes another song about, crooning at the audience about how she doesn\u2019t want to sing sad songs anymore. And so of course a book written to explain the problem of self-documentation becomes a document of the problem itself.", "Photo by Andy Ryan", "tracks Manguso through two decades and a half, much of which she spends, in her words, \u201cparalyzed by rumination.\u201d \u201cWhen I remember how this document began, I remember it as something I used to worry about,\u201d she writes, near the book\u2019s end. Thankfully, what the jacket copy calls \u201ctwo Copernican events\u201d\u2014pregnancy and a baby\u2014arrive to unclench Manguso\u2019s anxiety. \u201cThen I became a mother. I began to inhabit time differently,\u201d she writes. More specifically: \u201cI used to exist against the continuity of time. Then I became the baby\u2019s continuity, a background of ongoing time for him to live against.\u201d She adds: \u201cI was too exhausted or hormone-drunk or depressed to think of anything that resembled anything else.\u201d Finally, she\u2019s free from her own consciousness. Finally, she is able to experience things as \u201cjust themselves.\u201d", "In the context of", ", this feels like a welcome, if very drawn-out, conclusion. In the context of Manguso\u2019s other work, it seems somewhat strange. The fretted-over invisible diary contains events chronicled in her two previous books\u2014which is to say, plenty of material worth fretting about, like life-threatening neurodegenerative disease and the suicide of a friend who was like a brother. Having", "hover right over such topics as death and traumatic illness, yet rarely mention those things: It is a maddening act of compartmentalization. (But so are diaries.) If a hallmark of personal writing on the Internet is that it can feel emotionally graphic\u2014so tackily overexposed that it has a numbing effect\u2014Manguso\u2019s writing numbs for different reasons. She is trying so hard to skirt her feelings that she ends up saying nothing much at all.", "\u201cSelf-indulgent\u201d can mean many different things in writing that centers on the self. It\u2019s either a flaw or a lifeline, depending on who\u2019s tapping the keys. And Manguso shows flashes of attentive brilliance. But on the whole", "being, after all, a diary about", "a diary, feels like a new kind of self-indulgent altogether: a hall of mirrors with capacity for one. Manguso imagines at one point that \u201call anxiety might derive from a fixation on moments\u2014an inability to accept life as ongoing.\u201d It might also derive from a basic unwillingness to accept that freeform thoughts are not all equally interesting, no matter how elegant and raw.", "The relentless self-questioning in", "feels mainly performative, which could be the point: This, in the end, is the peril of writing about yourself for public consumption. Manguso interrogates herself as a rhetorical flourish. What if all the days a person saw die with them? She worries. What if we forget too much, remember too little, or vice versa, with all the wrong things? These questions are noble enough, but they\u2019re not what ifs, they\u2019re if thens. If you accepted that all of those things were true, would it change the way you lived? Would you go on to write a diary, and then a diary about that diary?
