All he has to do is ping, and I drop everything to do exactly as he commands. He\u2019s interruptive, needy, and suffocating. Also, frankly, his stamina isn\u2019t what it used to be; I have to carry a charger everywhere these days. Sure, he tells me what I want to hear (via Spotify recommendations) and is thoughtful enough to remind me (via pop-up notification) when trash day is. But at what cost?", "In", ", Harris explores the consequences of a collective shift to online life. Through conversations with historians, psychologists, physiologists, and other experts, he confirms all our worst suspicions. The Internet is an incredible asset, but it also makes us lazy, distracted, and selfish.", "However, Harris finds the most alarming part of this transition to be \u201cthe loss of lack.\u201d Harris uses \u201cabsence\u201d and \u201csolitude\u201d interchangeably throughout the book, but is fundamentally speaking to a dearth of time where we are alone with our own thoughts, singularly focused on our inner lives. He says that we do ourselves a disservice by being constantly connected. The Internet, even though it has the potential to permit meaningful communication, can also fill moments when it would be useful\u2014perhaps even transformative\u2014to reflect alone.", "Harris believes that in order to operate at full intellectual and emotional capacity, we have to experience absence. In a hyperconnected world, it is too easy to reach for the crutch of outside stimulation or to think only in reference to public life. The tools at our disposal are formidable, offering us easy knowledge, approval, and entertainment. But the life that we make public via the Internet is too knowable. \u201cWe hold some part of the world at a distance,\u201d Harris writes, \u201cand since we are forever", "the world, we end up holding some part of ourselves at a distance too.\u201d", "In order to reclaim absence, Harris commits himself to \u201cAnalog August.\u201d For a month, he lives fully off the grid, filling his days with books, walks, and daydreams. (For research!) He is surprised to find that this reincarnation of a former life feels unnatural, even impermissible for a time. He has to relearn the things he used to take for granted, like wearing a watch and using reference books. He feels inefficient, bored, and sometimes indignantly lonely\u2014\u201clike a child who ran away from home and then was crushed to discover nobody noticed his disappearance.\u201d The greatest lesson is exactly how much of his life was wrapped up in online technologies and how uncomfortable it felt to leave it all behind.

What many people don\u2019t understand about millennials is that our intense connectedness causes us to place an even greater premium on solitude. Some of the happiest moments of my adolescence were spent in snoozy, screenless seclusion\u2014lying on a blanket on my roof, listening to trains rumble by across the nearby river. In these instances I was able, as Harris hopes I remain, to center myself in space and time.", "The thing is that people of my generation\u2014the \u201cdigital natives\u201d\u2014experience true absence so seldom that it becomes exoticized, even fashionable, and turning off the smartphone is the ultimate indulgence. Of course, sometimes this is faux-authentic Instagram-your-new-vinyl nonsense. But enough of the time, it is genuine. We know the difference. As seductive as our gadgets are, they simply can\u2019t deliver the feeling you get atop your roof on a breezy April night.", "Photo by Hudson Hayden", "Sometimes solitude even comes through the very technologies that threaten it.
