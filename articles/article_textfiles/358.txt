By the time I got on stage for my eight-minute set, the audience was loose, so I riffed a bit about the comics who\u2019d gone before. I engaged one audience member whom the host had teased for being preppy.", "Then I started my planned set. My first two jokes, both fairly clean, were met with smatterings of laughter. I did another, more solid joke about being bisexual, which went well. I launched into the setup for my next joke, about my then-boyfriend. From the back, someone yelled, \u201cDoes your boyfriend know?\u201d referring to my bisexuality. I laughed and said that he did, keeping the atmosphere loose and attributing the heckling to a nonmalicious person just having fun. Thanks to the bright lights up on the stage, you can\u2019t really see the audience, so I had no idea who was yelling.", "I continued the joke, and the same voice yelled again\u2014this time, something homophobic and misogynistic. On stage, I was confused. I said, \u201cSir, if you\u2019re gonna talk to me, you need to come to the front because I can\u2019t see you.\u201d It was a huge, rookie mistake.", "I could definitely see him now. He was a crazy mess of a man, a smirking ball of smarm with jagged hair and dirty hands. He started to get on stage with me but I quickly gestured for him to sit in the front. Throughout my set, he continued talking to me, making lewd comments, leering, and completely derailing my act. At one point, he took out a digital camera and asked if I wanted to see some photos.", "\u201cSir,\u201d I said, just barely keeping it together. \u201cI\u2019m going to do my last joke and it\u2019s going to be great and you\u2019re going to shut the fuck up, OK?\u201d He nodded, but then as I started my joke, he shouted more disgusting phrases.", "Despite being kicked out by the hosts, the heckler waited for me at the bar after the show. In a panic, I texted my boyfriend to come get me at the venue, and went outside to wait for him. When my boyfriend got there, I grabbed his hand to walk away, and the door to the bar opened. From inside I heard the heckler\u2019s voice: \u201cByyyyye.\u201d", "That night, I was enraged and defeated. In an attempt to feel less helpless, I", ":", "Right now, I feel: beaten, destroyed, helpless, weak, ashamed for being so scared, shocked, worthless, less than, and terrified.

I also feel like I never want to do comedy again\u2026I suspect I can\u2019t be the only female comic who\u2019s felt threatened by an audience member, but I\u2019ve never heard of anything like this before.", "The next day, a fellow comic suggested I watch the", ".

In that moment and afterward, I needed to be a comedian.", "I was reminded of my own heckler experience as I read Yael Kohen\u2019s book,", "because the introduction to this oral history, citing", "and", "campaign, paints the book as a definitive answer to the noncontroversy that will not die: \u201cAre women funny?\u201d To that question I give a hearty eye-roll and a Gob Bluth-style, \u201cCome on!\u201d Of course women are funny, because people are funny. Gender has nothing to do with it, and to say this book answers the question \u201cAre women funny?\u201d does Kohen\u2019s work a disservice and implies it\u2019s a question worth answering or acknowledging, which it is not. Maybe it\u2019ll sell the book, but it mostly sells the book short.", "What the extensive interviews in", "make clear is the fact that I am able to be part of the comedy community thanks to the brave comediennes who came before.

Club owner Budd Friedman tells Kohen, \u201cIn comedy university, you never put two women on after each other.\u201d Later in the book, we meet a young Janeane Garofalo leading the charge against that idea, leaving old-school comedy clubs behind to play alternative venues like bars and bookstores. \u201cWell, we just had a female comic last weekend headlining and she bombed, so we\u2019re not going to have any more women,\u201d she says she was often told. She responded: Do you also say, \u201cSorry we had a white man here?\u201d", "A divide does still exist. For instance, a disturbing recurring theme of the book\u2019s interviews is the emphasis (by both male and female interviewees) on female comedians\u2019 looks.

Producer Barry Katz implies that Sarah Silverman got more stage time, and bettered her craft quicker, because everyone wanted to bang her. While Katz may be telling a sad truth, was it one that needed telling? Silverman is funny. Comedians are put on stage for all sorts of different reasons\u2014as favors, because they\u2019re pretty, because they run another popular show. It\u2019s their ability to deliver when they get there that counts.", "One", "writer laments that men shoot down sketches about nursing or menstruation, stereotyping that it\u2019s all women think is funny.

Misogyny was the least of her problems, she says, \u201c... It was not even gender-related. It just wasn\u2019t funny that year.\u201d In one baffling interview segment, stand-up instructor Lisa Sundstedt recounts telling a budding female comic not to joke about ejaculate. \u201cWhat do you want to be your legacy?\u201d she asks.
