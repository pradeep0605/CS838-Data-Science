{"Body": ["Anton Corbijn", "When reading a novelist\u2019s memoir, it\u2019s easy to retroactively psychoanalyze their characters through the lens of the author\u2019s childhood. Generally this is inadvisable; fiction is a glorious playground, which can be explored free of whatever one\u2019s parents did or failed to do. But the true lover of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s work must make an exception for his memoir", "The towering, bombastic, infuriatingly charismatic Ronnie, le Carr\u00e9\u2019s terrible (and mostly blessedly absentee) father, is the the chain that runs through each of the slightly disjointed tales that make up the book, despite le Carr\u00e9\u2019s desire to confine him to a single chapter. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him elbowing his way to the top of the hill,\u201d le Carr\u00e9 explains, but there he arrives, just the same. He describes his father as \u201ca crisis addict, a performance addict, a shameless pulpit orator and a scene-grabber.\u201d Ronnie beat up his mother, and he beat up le Carr\u00e9 himself, and spent much of his life in and out of prison (rubbing elbows with, among other notorious London lowlifes of the era, the Kray twins).", "The case has been made by many writers, including le Carr\u00e9 himself, that his heroes (especially the great George Smiley) are largely a reaction to James Bond, who le Carr\u00e9", "\u201ca neo-fascist gangster.\u201d Smiley is short, fat, and bald, repeatedly cuckolded by his young and beautiful wife. Karla, Smiley\u2019s antagonist, is himself an ascetic monk of a man, pulling no triggers, presiding instead like a puppet-master over a vast network of spies and operatives. In a genre where our hero typically tricks the villain into monologuing, it\u2019s notable that Smiley\u2019s first encounter with Karla (there will be only two) results in Smiley himself monologuing disastrously while Karla sits in dead silence.", "Certainly an anti-Bond, then, but the memoir reveals him also to be an anti-Ronnie. It\u2019s Ronnie who lived in hotels and squats, juggling identities and leaving secret families and girlfriends in his wake, Ronnie who drove fast cars and was quick with his fists and his verbal sparring. It\u2019s no accident that George Smiley fails on every level to rise to the standards we have come to expect from our spy heroes. The most tense moments in the le Carr\u00e9 oeuvre involve, at most, riffling through a desk or replacing one document with another. Smiley does much of his work in the back of a taxi, or sitting at home, deep in thought.", "Generally speaking, people who dislike le Carr\u00e9 novels find them boring. I too find them boring, but gloriously so. You may pick up", "in hopes of learning more about le Carr\u00e9\u2019s own background in intelligence, and you will be mildly disappointed. His novels already contain anything of interest one might want on that score, and what remains are the dullest realities of espionage: the interminable waiting in uninteresting towns, the attempt to build relationships with low-level functionaries who may or may not someday be of use, years of tedium punctuated with single moments of abject terror. Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s own career in the field ended when his identity was burned by Kim Philby, the notorious member of the Cambridge Five, an incident to which he devotes very little space. More delicious is the detail that in 1987, in Moscow, a mutual friend offered to introduce le Carr\u00e9 to Philby, who was then both dying and engaged in writing the second volume of his memoirs. Philby had hoped that le Carr\u00e9 would help him do so, a suggestion so absurd that le Carr\u00e9 feels no need to emphasize it other than a flat \u201cI declined to meet him.\u201d", "His friendships with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and his deeper relationship with Alec Guinness receive similarly brief air time. Le Carr\u00e9 was concerned when Burton was cast as Alec Leamas: \u201cHow on earth will this beautiful, thunderous, baritone Welsh voice and this overpowering Triple Alpha Male talent fit inside the character?\u201d His relief while watching Burton undergo the transformation of shrinking himself down to the role is palpable; however bankable, a le Carr\u00e9 hero must leave bombast and machismo at the door. Le Carr\u00e9 knows plenty about the trappings of toxic masculinity and has rejected it.", ", fundamentally, is an exercise in self-knowledge; the audience being himself as much as devoted followers like me. Even the title underscores this point, deriving from a shooting range in Monte Carlo stocked with game birds to which Ronnie once took le Carr\u00e9 while on a gambling binge. The pigeons who were not killed by the guns of the shooters promptly returned to the tunnels that confined them, despite having every chance to fly off.", "\u201cQuite why this image has haunted me for so long,\u201d le Carr\u00e9 writes, \u201cis something the reader is perhaps better able to judge than I am.\u201d", "", "Nicole Cliffe has written for the", ", the", ", and the Awl Network, and was the co-creator of the", ".", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
