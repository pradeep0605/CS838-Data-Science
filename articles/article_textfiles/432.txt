{"Body": ["Meg, having known you as long as I have, and all the conversations we\u2019ve had in that time about books and writing and careers and also life and friendship and aging, I have the sense that many of the ideas behind", "are things you\u2019ve done a great deal of thinking about. Do you have the same sense that I do, that this is a book that you\u2019ve been building for a long time?", "That\u2019s certainly true, though I don't think I realized it until I was well into it. What I knew initially was that I wanted to write about what happens to talent over time\u2014and do it by following a group of friends who know each other from adolescence through middle age, having met at a summer camp for talented teenagers.\u00a0But once the essential premise got underway, I saw that maybe it wasn\u2019t an accident that I\u2019d chosen a book that required a big sweep of time. And in fact that choice was related to the way I'd been thinking about life more and more.", "And what exactly was that way?", "Well, I suppose I\u2019d been focusing on changes that people undergo over years and decades. I\u2019d been thinking a lot about who'd dropped away, who\u2019d become well-known, who\u2019d become lonely, who was dead. There were a", "of obsessive thoughts about who was dead. I\u2019m still shocked at the deaths of friends, even years and years later.", "The fact that you let more of the city and the world in, along with all the people in this book\u2014and there\u2019s a pretty substantial cast of characters\u2014makes me feel that your whole conception of a novel was changing.", "You know, I started publishing novels very young. I sold my first book,", ", when I was a senior at Brown. And it came out the year after I graduated. But I have the sense that even though I started young, I began to mature late.", "I think your early work is pretty sophisticated.", "Well, I was more intuitive than anything else. I wanted the sentences to be fine, and I cared about style. Those things still do matter to me, of course. But the overarching sense of what a novel could be wasn\u2019t something I thought much about. And it kind of stayed this way for a long time. Pretty much until I started my novel", ", at which point I woke up a little, and wanted to challenge myself more in my work, and write a novel that was tighter and, I guess, bolder.", "This was conscious? That you should write in a different way?", "It was more like, the books I liked reading felt both freer and more focused than the ones I was writing. And I didn\u2019t know why that was. I started thinking that what makes novels work is an", "that propels them forward, and I hadn\u2019t always had that. And as I\u2019ve gotten \u201cmature\u201d\u2014which makes it sound like I\u2019m talking about going through puberty here in delightful middle age\u2014I guess I mean that I now feel compelled to try and make my books more urgent.", "What do you mean by urgency?", "I\u2019ve had moments, quite a few pages into reading a book, when I\u2019ll think, irritably,", "Maybe the writer hasn\u2019t found the imperative", "Which isn\u2019t to say that good writing can\u2019t be both good and leisurely.", "Or beautiful.", "Exactly. Leisurely and beautiful is maybe my dream. But you need to give the reader a sense of why you are \u201ctelling them this.\u201d Why they need to become absorbed in your story and your language. It\u2019s really difficult to do; I worry about it whenever I look over new pages I\u2019ve written.", "As your editor, naturally I\u2019m biased. I feel that", "totally has what you call imperative. Some of the writing is beautiful, too. I wouldn\u2019t call it leisurely, though it\u2019s pretty long, for you.", "My new nickname is William T. Vollmann.", "But your book is really a \u201cbig\u201d novel in all senses of the word. Big in size, broader in its coverage of time, and the changes in people\u2019s lives, and it\u2019s ambitious in scope, and it\u2019s also accompanied by \u201cbig book buzz.\u201d", "Oh God \u2026 \u201c", "Of course, this topic of how fiction is perceived, big or small, is something you wrote about in a", "almost exactly a year ago. Which came first, the ambition and vision for the book, or the insights that went into the essay?", "I have a chicken and egg answer, I think. I've been absorbed for a long time in questions about men and women and fiction; I tried to address them\u2014or impale them\u2014in", "10 years ago. Since that time, these ideas have sometimes found their way sort of obliquely into my fiction, and other times they've simply made for a passionate conversation.", "I knew I wanted to write an essay about this, because it was what I thought about all the time. As I kept playing with ideas about the different ways literature by men and women is often treated, I was also deep into", "But as I mapped out the essay, I may have also (coincidentally or not) allowed myself to try and put a little more unconflicted muscularity and energy in my novel. I mean, you may not be able to control how your book will be treated, but no matter who you are, you have to write what absorbs and preoccupies you. There's no point otherwise. Thinking directly about gender issues, which do absorb and preoccupy me, I guess\u2014and also looking at the", "\u2014did light something up in me, and at least some of that light was applied directly to my fiction.", "\u201cGender issues\u201d\u2014I\u2019m glad you brought that up.", "But I bet you\u2019re not surprised I did.", "No I\u2019m not. One of the elements you mentioned in your essay for the", "was the difference between the jacket designs for novels written by men and those for novels written by women. You wrote about the soft, figurative, domestic-looking covers of novels by some women, and the big-lettered, bolder covers of novels by men. And you suggested that these covers sent varying messages of importance and authority.", "They absolutely do. People have told me that they\u2019ve asked to have more input into how their books look, and I think that\u2019s great. I mean, it\u2019s", "book. It has to look like a book you\u2019d be proud to have written. A book that\u2019s not marginalized by its cover, and that both men and women will take seriously.", "As a result of your piece, we approached the art for this book with particular sensitivity to these ideas, and the art department was given a copy of your essay along with the manuscript. How did we do?", "Wonderfully.", "Thanks, I\u2019m glad.", "The book is beautiful and inviting, but it\u2019s also gender-neutral, with bold lettering. It's a design-based cover that I really love.", "Yes, and I also feel that it doesn't seem to warn potential male readers away by using what you described as coded images to tell them that this is a book solely for women.", "I really appreciate the way the art department\u2014and you\u2014worked carefully with what I wanted to express. Not just about gender, but also about intention. This is a book about friendship, envy, and talent. It needed a cover that feels partly young, because the characters are often young in here. And I think it needed a cover that hints at an earlier era\u2014the 1970s, the decade that opens the book, but then it moves back and forth between the present and then\u2014but evokes a feeling of some deep nostalgia and beauty, and makes the reader say, \u201cLet me in.\u201d This cover is like walking into a painting done at summer camp by a very young Mark Rothko.", "Wow, I will pass that along. That\u2019s a nice\u00ad\u00ad\u2014if broad\u2014segue into talking about our relationship: editor and writer. Maybe you could briefly describe how you think we work together\u2014what the process is, from your perspective.", "Sure. As you know, I tend to like to meet with you early on and tell you my \"intentions.\" And then you question some of them, and respond positively to others. I usually scribble pages of notes, some of which are hard for me to understand later. Once, on a scrap of paper from lunch, I scrawled the note, \"What does the book mean? And what does it REALLY mean?\" Is this very different from how you work with your other writers, Sarah? I mean, I guess you do have other writers, but I don\u2019t like to think about them. That was a joke.", "I have a very different process with almost every writer I work with, and it all depends on a variety of things, but largely it comes down to the writer\u2019s personal process\u2014whether they find it helpful to discuss the work early, or only when they\u2019ve come out the other side. And whether the part they want or need help with is on the line, structure, story, character, or idea level.", "This sounds very scientific.", "Oh, it isn\u2019t. You just have to feel the writer out in each case to see what he or she needs, and what will work best. You and I know each other particularly well, having worked on five books over 11 or 12 years.", "That sounds impressive when you put it like that.", "It is. And I think the trust we\u2019ve built up allows for a liberation from judgment, which lets brainstorming conversations roam especially freely. And because you so clearly convey to me, early on, what you\u2019re trying to achieve with a book, part of my job as we progress through the drafts is not just to make sure the book reads well, but to make sure you\u2019re succeeding in your intentions.", "Listening to you say this, I\u2019m reminded that I\u2019m very, very lucky. I know some people who basically get a few comments left in the margins like little droppings. \u201cNice!\u201d the editor writes, months after the writer handed it in. Or, \u201cMake her more assertive.\u201d I feel very grateful at how deeply you work, and how patient you are.", "And I feel grateful that you choose to wrestle with certain big-novel ideas.
