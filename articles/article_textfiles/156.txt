She\u2019s old enough, and physically ripe in all the ways she needs to be, to make men \u201cblush\u201d and \u201cstammer.\u201d But she\u2019s also young enough to wonder, when her father\u2019s live-in best friend, Gordy, rubs her back at night, about \u201cthe place beneath a girl\u2019s armpit that the back ends and the", "begins.\u201d Do \u201cbody parts meet clearly at dotted lines,\u201d she asks herself, \u201clike pink and green states on a gas-station map,\u201d and has Gordy crossed a border he shouldn\u2019t have?", "Rainey can\u2019t decide if her sexuality is a powerful tool or a curse she\u2019d just as soon be rid of.", "In", ", Landis explores the boundaries between sexual object and subject, victim and agent. It is Greenwich Village in the 1970s, and lines are blurry. Howard Royal is a jazz musician whose five-story townhouse is a revolving door for his acolytes, whom he invites into his home on account of both their musical prowess and their willingness to join him in the bedroom. Rainey\u2019s mother, Linda Royal, has left for an ashram in Colorado, and Gordy has partly taken her place\u2014brushing Rainey\u2019s hair, for instance. But his nightly tuck-ins, long past the age at which a girl should be tucked in, are menacing and unwelcome. He and Howard share everything; before Linda left for the ashram, she \u201ccame and went from both bedrooms without embarrassment.\u201d", "Rainey, not surprisingly, is both intrigued and repulsed by sex. Howard calls his daughter a \u201ccenterfold,\u201d and compares her figure to Sophia Loren\u2019s. When she says, \u201cScrew you,\u201d he replies, \u201cYou can do better than your old dad.\u201d At 13, Rainey is pinned down by Gordy in the bushes at Central Park, \u201cthe only time he lost control, and they still didn\u2019t go all the way,\u201d she tells us.", "Rainey can\u2019t decide if her sexuality is a powerful tool or a curse she\u2019d just as soon be rid of, often feeling scandalized the moment her seduction achieves its desired result.", "She loves how she and her friend Tina \u201ccan sit in certain ways and force certain male teachers to look at them.\u201d But even as she intends to allure, she teeters between feelings of empowerment and guilt. When Gordy\u2019s tucks-ins make her squirm, she feels \u201cresponsible for sending scent molecules through some primal part of his brain.\u201d", "The men in the book are almost all at least one part sinister and one part weak, and they reinforce Rainey\u2019s sense of responsibility for the attention they lavish on her. Before Gordy nearly rapes her in the park, he says, \u201cYou radiate power and light,\u201d as though she\u2019s the one in control. Later, Damien, one of Howard\u2019s acolytes, does rape Rainey, in her bedroom. Then he shrugs. \u201cYou patted your bed,\u201d he says. \u201cYou did that thing with your eyes.\u201d She runs to her father, and he similarly dismisses the charge, suggesting that \u201cletting him in her room\u201d could be \u201ca \u2018half yes.\u2019 \u201d", "What Rainey doesn\u2019t fully understand, but what Landis gets completely, is the way that these experiences shape the young woman\u2019s behavior outside of the castle-cum-prison that is her home. She tries to reclaim the power men have robbed her of, bullying girls, and even faculty, at school: When a chemistry teacher expresses concern about her home life, Rainey, hating that her vulnerability has been exposed, resolves to flirt with the teacher\u2019s boyfriend, to show her who has the upper hand.", "Courtesy of Lauren Shay Lavin", "And Rainey seeks a substitute for the shelter her parents should have provided, soliciting the protection of St. Catherine of Bologna\u2014or Cath, as she calls her, whose picture she tears from a library book and tucks into her backpack. Cath is the patron saint for artists and against temptation. \u201cRainey is an artist,\u201d Landis writes, \u201cand she", "temptation.\u201d She knows she\u2019s more in need of protection from the temptation of others than from her own, and she\u2019s envious that, \u201cin the Cloister, Cath will never listen at night for the marquis padding toward her through chilled marble halls.\u201d When they exhumed Cath\u2019s body 18 days after her death, she was in pristine condition: \u201cUndefiled by men, undefiled by death.\u201d", "Rainey\u2019s struggle to be a subject instead of an object extends to her relationship with art. \u201cDon\u2019t try to understand jazz, Gordy said once:", "\u201d But Rainey does not want to be jazz. Not when, on the floor of Gordy\u2019s room, a cello \u201clies naked and bright.\u201d Not when, after Damien rapes her, Howard protests, \u201cHave you heard that boy play cornet? Have you", "\u201d She grew up on bebop instead of nursery rhymes, but there was always a hint of danger in its riffs, and so Rainey turns away from music to visual art. She makes tapestries out of the belongings of the dead. In the way she pieces together buttons and photographs, we see a girl longing for her mother, attempting to resurrect memories to endure her loss, as the losses of others stand in for her own.", "spans 11 years in just 246 pages, and the jumps in time can be abrupt. On one page, Rainey is 18, and on the next, she\u2019s 23. And despite leapfrogging over half a decade, Rainey at 23 is almost indistinguishable from Rainey at 18. It\u2019s not for lack of incident in her life: So much happens offstage it feels as though a chapter has been ripped cleanly from the binding. In later chapters, Landis shifts the narrative voice from Rainey to her friends Leah and Tina, making it even more difficult to grasp the extent of Rainey\u2019s transformation. The novel-in-stories structure allows for a narrative looseness that more traditional novels tend not to get away with, but there were times when I longed for the tighter transitions that conventional form brings with it. The last story focuses on Tina\u2019s relationship with Howard and spends little time on Rainey\u2019s, and it feels like a detour away from our agreed-upon destination. (Those who want to fill in some of the stories\u2019 gaps will be glad to know that Landis\u2019 first collection,", ", gives us more of Rainey and Tina and Leah, with the latter character coming to the fore.)", "Still, the language Landis uses to get us there is transporting, sensual and musical by turns, appropriately enough for a book about sex and jazz. Now that I\u2019ve seen a sandwich described as having a \u201cpetticoat of lettuce,\u201d I will never look at BLTs the same. Leah, a victim of Rainey\u2019s bullying\u2014and Howard\u2019s lustful gaze\u2014is \u201cthe tottering lamb who cannot see the altar.\u201d Touching the eyelids of an old man who has commissioned a tapestry, \u201cher fingertips detect the darting motions of tiny fish.\u201d And more than her often-stunning prose, it\u2019s Landis\u2019 exploration of teenage sexuality that sets her book apart. Landis sees the way that, as a girl lurches, sometimes too quickly, toward adulthood, sex can bleed into friendships and alter family dynamics, causing wounds and leaving scars. And Landis sees a way through it all as well: After Rainey\u2019s grandmother refuses to let Rainey become trustee of the house her father has made unwelcoming, she tells her granddaughter, \u201ca girl must always be her own trustee.\u201d Rainey takes this as a mantra: \u201cBe trustee of her own self. Be trustee of the house that is her person.\u201d It is all\u2014it is everything\u2014a girl can hope to do.", "---", ", by Dylan Landis.
