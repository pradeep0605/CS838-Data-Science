{"Body": ["Photo by Joe Klamar/AFP/GettyImages", "One dreary October Saturday I was sitting in a Starbucks in downtown Washington reading my review copy of Brad Stone\u2019s", ". My iPhone was running low on charge, and the charger I normally keep in my bag was gone. There was a Radio Shack across the street. They had the charger I needed and the price was perfectly reasonable. While ringing me up, the cashier asked the inevitable question: Would I like to pay Radio Shack extra money for a worthless one-year warranty that clearly made no sense whatsoever for such a low-value piece of commodity electronics?", "Of course he didn\u2019t exactly put it that way. But that was the value proposition. And you could tell by his demoralized tone that he neither expected nor wanted me to buy the warranty. Yet whether at Radio Shack,", ", or at the former Circuit City, this sort of tactic is integral to the business model. Stone doesn\u2019t have much to say about Radio Shack or Best Buy or Barnes & Noble in his book. But he should, because the real nature of Amazon\u2019s achievement is about customer relations, not just online ordering.", "The story of Bezos\u2019 personal life is well-told in", ", forming a sort of entrepreneurial stations of the cross. There\u2019s a childhood gifted with educational opportunities but marred by the absence of his biological father (\u201cbelonging to a unicycle troupe didn\u2019t pay much,\u201d Stone writes). There\u2019s the relentless drive and determination from an early age. There\u2019s the youthful job at D. E. Shaw & Company, the hedge fund whose mercurial founder redefined the industry and showed the power of thinking outside the box. We\u2019ve got the daring decision to start a new company\u2014literally in a garage at first. Then comes the key early six-figure investment in the company by Bezos\u2019 mom and stepdad\u2014a forceful reminder of the deeply uneven playing field in American life.", "If you\u2019re interested in the company, Stone\u2019s history is consistently engaging and full of amusing anecdotes. Bezos\u2019 high-school valedictorian speech outlined \u201chis dream of saving humanity by creating permanent colonies in orbiting space stations while turning the planet into an enormous nature preserve.\u201d During the company\u2019s early years, executives from Seattle had to help staff up distribution centers during the holiday rush. The strong labor market made it hard to obtain quality temp help; one early hire dispatched to Delaware \u201cwatched one worker get fired for intoxication and then wet himself while he tried to protest.\u201d At a high-level executive meeting shortly before the launch of Amazon Web Services, Bezos unilaterally lowered the price. When warned that would cause the company to lose money on AWS for a long time, the CEO simply replied, \u201cGreat!\u201d\u2014he thought high profits would only attract competition.", "The best part of the book is set during the early-to-mid aughts, when the post-dot-com blues raised serious questions as to whether the company could continue to exist at all.", "Of today\u2019s tech giants, the vast majority either went public well before (Apple, Microsoft) or well after (Google, Facebook) the great technology mania of the 1990s.", "Most companies from that era", ", of course. And most of the survivors such as AOL, Yahoo, and eBay, are more or less struggling. Amazon stands alone as a dial-up-era company thriving in the present day. But this was a close thing. The 1999 iteration of Amazon had all the problems of a classic money-bleeding bubble company. It was only a well-timed European bond issue that let Amazon avoid a disastrous financial crunch.", "Amazon subsisted for several years thanks to cash injections from deals it made to run the website back-ends of several big box retailers, including Toys-R-Us, Target, Borders, and Circuit City. These tales, coming from a time when Amazon was neither a fascinating startup nor a dominant player, are not well-known, and they nicely illustrate the combination of hard work, intelligence, and old-fashioned dumb luck it takes to succeed in business.", "As the book goes on and Amazon survives, then thrives, then dominates, the shrewd business dealings of its CEO can begin to look more menacing. Scrappy negotiating from a startup feels more like bullying from an incumbent. Stone\u2019s recounting of the hardball tactics Bezos used to acquire Zappos and Diapers.com are slightly horrifying. Faced with promising newcomers to e-commerce spaces that he wanted to add to his empire, Bezos in both cases opened with lowball acquisition offers. When rebuffed, instead of negotiating he launched ferocious price wars, selling shoes and diapers at far below wholesale cost. Once it was clear Bezos would rather lose millions destroying rivals than spend them on higher acquisition prices, both firms were induced to sell and join the Amazon family. And hey, at least those Web startups got buyout offers and ultimately made money from Bezos\u2019 empire-building. Bookstore chains just got stomped on.", "But throughout it all, Amazon stays remarkably true to its core vision of long-term growth via customer satisfaction. The company and its CEO are not without their dark sides, but it\u2019s never consumers who have cause to complain. When Bezos throws sharp elbows his tactic is almost always to lower prices. The official company line that everything they do is in pursuit of better serving their customers sounds self-serving, but as best anyone can tell it\u2019s true. Even in its best years, Amazon\u2019s profit margins are thin, and", ". I once described the company as \u201ca charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers,\u201d which", "who explained that long-term shareholder value is created by building long-term relationships with customers.", "This is where the absence of a comparative perspective in Stone\u2019s book hurts it. Bezos\u2019 core ideas\u2014long-term focus, consumers first\u2014are correct but hardly earth-shattering. But while most companies just pay lip service to this stuff, Amazon stands out by actually doing it. The deep structure of American financial capitalism almost", ". That, rather than stupidity, is what leaves Radio Shack addicted to brand-killing warranty pitches and kept Barnes & Noble perennially a day late and a dollar short on the Web. CEOs are loath to deliberately take a short-term profit hit, no matter the long-term upside. Companies change and adapt not when they should, but when they have no choice\u2014and by then it\u2019s usually too late.", "What makes Bezos probably the greatest businessman in America today (I should note that", "has an affiliate relationship with Amazon, though unlike our former corporate partners at the", "we\u2019re not owned by Jeff Bezos) is his ability to actually stick with these ideas. It\u2019s not so much that he sees things other executives miss, but that he manages to actually do them. Nobody has been better at keeping Wall Street\u2019s confidence even during a quarter or two of bad earnings, or at keeping his team\u2019s confidence even during a year or two of bad stock performance. Stone\u2019s narrow focus occasionally exaggerates the originality of Bezos\u2019 vision (Amazon wasn\u2019t the first online bookstore, or the first company to focus on everyday low prices, or the first vendor of cloud computing services) while understating his unusual mastery of the larger corporate game.", "At the same time, those interested in a broader discussion of Amazon\u2019s implications for the future of small business, commercial real estate, wages and working conditions, book publishing, or the American economy as a whole will be disappointed. Such matters all rate mention, but little in the way of sustained engagement or discussion. But if Stone and Bezos are right that Amazon will only grow and grow in the years to come\u2014and I think they are\u2014there will be time for other books. For now, Stone\u2019s tale of the birth, near-death, and impressive revival of an iconic American company is well worth your time.", "", "---", "by Brad Stone.
