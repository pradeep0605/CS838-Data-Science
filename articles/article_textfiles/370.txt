This wave of anniversaries isn\u2019t surprising, given that my 20s (like many movie lovers\u2019, and like Geoff Dyer\u2019s) were a time of intense and voracious cinephilia. Dyer, who was born in 1958, came of age during the golden age of repertory film in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, when the works of directors like Tarkovsky, Bergman, Godard, and Bresson were in permanent rotation in one-screen theaters. Throughout the book, he wryly evokes his years as a young, acid-dropping film rat inhabiting \u201ca squalid flat in Brixton.\u201d He also persuasively argues that almost no one sees", "film\u2014the one that helps to form their cinematic consciousness, the way", "did for him\u2014after the age of 30.

All I can say is, if internal monologue or discursive footnotes are deal-breakers for you, don\u2019t read", ". The footnote apparatus as Dyer employs it isn\u2019t entirely effective\u2014unlike in David Foster Wallace\u2019s work, the distinction between what belongs in a footnote and what doesn\u2019t often seems random\u2014but given the intricate convolutions of his mind, it\u2019s easy to see why Dyer decided to use that format. And hard to resist doing the same.

And though Dyer does devote some passages to the film\u2019s shifting color palette (from high-contrast sepia-toned black and white to vivid color) or the framing of individual shots, his comments on the film tend toward the discursively philosophical.

I did like when he invoked the weird", "of seeing a loved person\u2019s face seemingly doubled on-screen: \u201cAfter a while this became so striking I whispered to my wife: She looks incredibly like you. \u2018I know,\u2019 my wife whispered back.\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t want to cut out the passage in which he reflects on how the resemblance between his wife and that of the on-screen hero, played in the Soderbergh version by George Clooney, increased Dyer\u2019s sense of identification with the hero\u2019s dilemma. (In", ", to summarize a confoundingly difficult movie very briefly, a man in a remote space station is visited by what may be either the ghost or some sort of alien-engineered replicant of his dead wife.) But perhaps I could have done without the subsequent reassurance that multiple independent observers have confirmed the McElhone resemblance, or the information that, when Dyer and his wife happened to get a real-life look at the actress years later, the occasion was at \u201ca lavish fund-raiser for the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.\u201d Still, the whole rambling McElhone anecdote arguably pays off, as Dyer ends on the sharp, wistful observation that, eight years after", "s\u2019 release, neither his wife nor Natascha McElhone look like the Natascha McElhone of the movie: \u201cOnly the film preserves that memory of how alike they were, more alike than the two films of the same book.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine Dyer\u2019s beleaguered editor throwing up her hands and saying, Oh hell, just leave it all in. What purpose would it serve to rein in Geoff Dyer?
