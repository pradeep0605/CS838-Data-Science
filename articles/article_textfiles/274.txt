The Havillands take a shine to Helen. (When they meet, she is catering a gallery opening for paintings by \u201cemotionally disturbed adult artists\u201d; they are buying.) They adopt her as they would another stray, inviting her to their extravagant parties and showering her in beautiful, costly gifts. Ava asks Helen, who dreams of becoming a photographer, to catalog her vast art collection in album form. Swift promises to use his connections to help her regain custody of her kid. Though the", "scene one keeps anticipating never comes, it is still the perfect seduction.", "Of course Maynard needs a loyal, stable, boring foil for the Havillands, and his name is Elliott: an accountant who (God help us) reads the tax code for kicks.

Nothing surprises, though all is exaggerated. Though Maynard\u2019s attitude toward Helen is too sympathetic for satire, her cartoonish characters and situations lift her out of realism, resulting in an unsubtle, melodramatic, admittedly addictive goop.", "Consider Helen\u2019s ludicrous backstory, which begins with a missing father and a neglectful mother: \u201cI remember a great many bologna sandwiches and granola bars \u2026 Old lottery tickets piled on the counter, never the winning number.\u201d As a child, she fantasized about moneyed elegance and informed her classmates that she was Audrey Hepburn\u2019s granddaughter.

Penniless, she weds an emotionally abusive mortgage broker named Dwight, with whom she has a son, Ollie; Dwight unceremoniously divorces her and seems content to ignore the fact of his son\u2019s existence, while his ex-wife slips into a kind of nocturnal, secret alcoholism that allows her to function normally during the day.", "One night, however, Ollie wakes up with the sure signs of appendicitis, and Helen, too addled to call an ambulance, is arrested for driving under the influence en route to the hospital.

Instead, she stagily \u201clifts the veil\u201d on the couple\u2019s profound brokenness, as if a paralyzed woman and her playboy husband who spend their life together trying to buy the world\u2019s admiration could, in a novel like this, be anything other than profoundly broken.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!

Helen\u2019s fragility, Swift and Ava\u2019s venality, read as real qualities sent through a rudimentary fictionalization machine.
