{"Body": ["Photos by Beowulf Sheehan, Nina Subin, and Kate Cassaday", "Emma, what is it like working with two editors on your books? When I came aboard for", ", I was the new girl stepping into an old relationship. So I was very conscious of the fact that the two of you might have had systems and ways of working together in place.", "Well, I think Iris and I had worked together on only one book ahead of you, so it\u2019s not as if she had been my editor for 20 years and you were intruding or anything. I suppose it was less scary for me because I knew one of my editors (Iris) already. But", "felt like a new experience anyway\u2014there was so much excitement about its publication worldwide from the start. So I had no sense that you were the new girl, Judy.", "Well, that\u2019s good. What helped for me, just in terms of process, was that you, Emma, were very clear from the start that you wanted to hear from both of us separately.\u00a0 And I think with some authors where there are two editors working on a book, they get together behind the scenes and communicate about the edits and combine them into one editorial letter. And you wanted to hear from me, what I thought, and from Iris, what she thought. And I suppose we\u2019re lucky, or maybe it\u2019s not luck that neither of us said anything that completely contradicted the other!", "It\u2019s very interesting that you say that some authors ask for a single editorial letter. I much prefer to get everyone\u2019s opinions separately, because if I got a single editorial letter, it would be like getting a note from God!", "I know. Well, I think it\u2019s an unusual situation. But I think that with many authors, especially younger authors, they might get confused by hearing two different voices. And so for them having one set of notes that suggests to them what to do is perhaps easier, whereas I think you would sort it out if one editor said one thing and the other said something totally different.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not looking for a homogenous, blended editorial view. I love the specificity of one of you being confused by Page 10 and one of you being irritated by Page 20. Also, I often have three editors (including the U.K.), and I find that if two editors agree on something, I pretty much give in and say fine. But if only one editor out of the three makes a point, I might think, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just a minority view!\u201d I didn\u2019t specifically ask all three of you when you guessed who the murderer was in", ", but I know that Iris figured it out early, and so I remember thinking, \u201cOne in three of my readers, that\u2019s too many! I\u2019m going to have to fix that and remove some of the hints there.\u201d It\u2019s useful for me to have the entirely individual feedback you each give me.", "was a more thorough edit than", ", because it\u2019s more complicated in its setting and main characters. With an historical novel, so much more needs to be on the page in terms of detail so that the reader can locate the character in the setting. Everything from the way the city streets of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown looked in 1876 to Blanche\u2019s clothing when she dances \u201cThe Flea\u201d and to the particulars of a Baby Farm. Each detail has to be perfectly placed to create the backdrop and yet not get in the way of the story.", "What is it like when you first give your work to us? Are you nervous? I never think of you as being nervous!", "When I hand it on to you editors, I\u2019m extremely nervous that you won\u2019t like it. With the first book bought by any one editor, there\u2019s no prior relationship there, so in a way I don\u2019t take the judgments personally. But as soon as I\u2019m onto a second or third book, I really want the relationship to continue, and I hate to disappoint. I feel like a child handing in my essay to a trusted and beloved teacher. So of course I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t like it. But I would say that once you\u2019ve bought the book, I then relax, and I feel OK that I may get 30 pages of editorial notes from you, but that\u2019s fine, because we\u2019re all working toward the same goal here.", "Iris, I\u2019m curious just because obviously we\u2019ve had such a great working relationship, the three of us. You don\u2019t have to name names, but have you ever gotten into a situation with another author being published somewhere else where you\u2019ve", "disagreed about something fundamental in the edit?", "No, not yet. I\u2019m looking forward to that! When I read the other editor\u2019s editorial notes or have a conversation with the author who has already then received the other notes, sometimes I\u2019m surprised by the emphasis that the other editor puts on something that I might not have thought was crucial or interesting or relevant, but the other editor feels strongly about that point. And then, in the end, if the author calls, we do quite often have long conversations about the other editor\u2019s notes and talk them through to see if they make sense within the author\u2019s vision of the book.", "You know, me neither. I\u2019ve always found my editors\u2019 suggestions to be compatible. They make different points but almost never directly clashing points. And of course I do feel it\u2019s my call in the end, so I\u2019ve had times where I reject certain views of one of my three editors, but it\u2019s never caused a big fight. It\u2019s never been something really substantive like, \u201cI think you should cut the second half of the book,\u201d or something like that. Because I\u2019ve had some encounters with the world of film, I often tell friends how different film is than the publishing world, because in film, these people have to invest so much money in every scene that it gives them the right to boss the writer around. In the publishing world, it seems as if what you want is my best book, and you want to have me get there, but you\u2019re not going to tell me what to do. So I\u2019ve never felt bullied within the editorial relationship.", "How about you, Judy? Have you ever had another working relationship with an editor where your idea about how the novel should be developed is radically opposed?", "No, not in terms of how the novel should be developed, but I did have one situation where there was a political issue. There was a scene in the book about the burning of the Quran, which this particular editor felt would be hugely inflammatory in their territory. And the author felt very strongly about keeping it in, and so there was a lot of back and forth almost to the point of things coming to blows. It was really complicated for the editor. She had very strong feelings about the scene, but at the end of the day, as you say, it was the author\u2019s choice. It actually all worked out fine in the end. But it was an intense conversation, and pretty unique!", "What was the inspiration for", "?", "It all began with the murder: I came across it in somebody else\u2019s book. There\u2019s a wonderful historical survey of Victorian women called", "by Autumn Stephens. She lives in the Bay Area, and literally one little paragraph of hers was on Jenny Bonnet, and it mentioned the circumstances of this murder. And I thought Jenny Bonnet was a perfect murder victim in that she was such a maverick figure, a joker, a rebel, and so she seemed the right kind of person to get shot dead at 27. Her character and plot fit together in the way they do in the best works of literature, whereas in real life it\u2019s pretty random who gets killed. What surprised me in the writing process was that the survivor of the crime, Blanche, turned out to be the single point-of-view character. I tried it a few ways, and I tried it in a different order, and I tried it with Jenny telling half of the story, but it turned out to be very much Blanche\u2019s angle on the whole thing. It\u2019s always fun when a project, even the one that you\u2019ve been planning for 15 years, then surprises you in how it works out.", "While you\u2019re writing", ", are you thinking about the next book? Do you always have your next project in mind even when you\u2019re working on the one you\u2019re absorbed in?", "Yeah. Typically the next four. They\u2019re lined up looking at me a bit patiently; it\u2019s like a queue of supplicants at the door. And they\u2019re each tapping their watches and saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting years already. When are you going to write me?\u201d", "Well, that\u2019s good for us, right, Iris? That means we\u2019ll still be in business if Emma\u2019s got four more ideas.", "---", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
