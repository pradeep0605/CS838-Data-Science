That question has, at some level, plagued many if not all of those who would write about the composer. In their efforts to be biographically comprehensive or else musicologically precise, there\u2019s been a certain hollowing-out of the basic fun involved in loving the very freeness of Cage\u2019s project, which at root sought to do away with all manner of rules\u2014of harmony, of how music and dance could relate to one another, of the great-man theories that form our Germanically-Capitalized Notions of Genius in Fine Art.", "While Gann solved this problem by going short, the art critic Kay Larson has now gone long\u2014and speculatively gonzo\u2014in her strangely structured, 417-page appreciation of the composer\u2019s public and inner lives,", ". The subtitle may seem to be casting about for an audience\u2014a little bit for the self-help crowd, a bit for the art-history buffs\u2014but this mashup of histories and aesthetics that Larson proposes develops into something not just convincing, but revelatory.", "Larson knows from creative inner lives thanks to her multidecade career as an art critic for the likes of", ",", ", the", ", and the", ". Her Zen credentials originate, she tells us in a foreword, from an intensive study and practice of Buddhism that began in the wake of the \u201cabrupt\u201d end of her full-time job, back in the 1990s. (Media-world types might wince at the tale that bit implies.) Cage lover that I am, I entered the book dubious that she could unpack the work of Cage the composer, no matter how well read she is in his journals. I was nitpicking my way through the text, wondering why she was breaking up the Cage life-story to tell us about a centuries-old permutation of Buddhism even before the part of the story where Cage makes his own turn toward Zen. Was the book going to be this reductive and deterministic throughout, I wondered, by reading all of Cage\u2019s many permutations of mind as inexorably tied to his eventual Zen awakening? But after page 200\u2014say, at the point when Larson brought Cage\u2019s first \u201chappening\u201d seamlessly into conversation with contemporaneous events like", "\u2019s Columbia University lectures (which Cage attended) and the creation of", "(who had fallen into Cage\u2019s retinue)\u2014I just started writing", "in the book\u2019s margins. The whole strange mesh of it was speaking to me, and I stopped keeping score of how many times Larson missed or muffled a minor point\u2014like her incorrect claim that CD players have always replaced turntables in modern performances of Cage\u2019s earliest percussion pieces. I merely began to treasure the odd texture of her finely synthesized enthusiasms, and what it could teach me about works I already thought I knew pretty damn well.", "It sounds like a parody of a Buddhistically deep koan to suggest that the book about Cage most likely to entrance newcomers is the same one that will most startle the class of so-called experts on the subject\u2014but that\u2019s the trick Larson has managed here. Some of the Cage-ian dramas that appeal mostly to modern-music geeks, like the composer\u2019s brief friendship and longer breakup with Pierre Boulez, are sketched briefly or not at all. His music for larger forces\u2014such as choruses or orchestras\u2014is given short shrift compared to small-ensemble pieces that engage dance and other forms (like conceptual art) more directly. Despite these choices,", "may not just be the best book written yet about John Cage; it\u2019s probably also one of the most substantive-yet-readable entryways into the nexus of 20", "-century American art and the immortal qualities of Eastern thought.", "It\u2019s one thing to journalistically note, as any biographer could, that Cage read such-and-such a volume or met this or that personage before composing whatever piece. But in case after case, Larson brings the spirit of transmission fully alive in the space between each inspirational artifact she identifies and the work in Cage\u2019s catalog fashioned thereafter. If you don\u2019t have recordings of Cage\u2019s first percussion pieces, you\u2019ll want to snag some after reading the way she relates how the composer wrote", "in the grip of his as-yet-unconsummated attraction to the dancer and choreographer\u2014and Cage\u2019s future partner\u2014Merce Cunningham. (Get", "that Mode Records put out last year.) \u201cCage was offering Cunningham a proposition,\u201d Larson claims, in assessing", ". \u201cIf not yet a sexual proposition (perhaps), it was certainly a proposal about fusing his music with Cunningham\u2019s choreography.\u201d", "And if you do already have a copy of", ", you\u2019ll pull it out again upon reading Larson\u2019s provocative suggestion, if only to marvel anew at how the piece\u2019s subtle layering of randomized sound samples works so elegantly with the written-out parts for piano and drums, despite having been fashioned on deadline for a fast-approaching dance recital. (Of course Cunningham fell for Cage. Of course he left Martha Graham\u2019s tutelage and conceptual approach behind. Wouldn\u2019t you do the same, if an admirer wrote something so perfectly tailored to your movements?) Just months after the premiere of", ", Cage and Cunningham debuted a new collaborative piece, and the way Larson narrates the latter\u2019s contribution\u2014\u201ca short dance solo of leaps and half-turns of the spine and arms cocked at the elbow: movement without narrative content\u201d\u2014makes their coming together seem romantically and aesthetically inevitable.", "Photo by Bernard Handzel.", "Before his turn toward Zen, Cage\u2019s experimental spirit was inspired by what he saw in Cunningham\u2019s bearing\u2014and to make that story sing, Larson has to tell the story of Cage\u2019s sexual evolution, and some truths about the law-weaponized forms of homophobia as practiced in the 1940s against other (allegedly) gay composers, more directly than other biographers have dared. (Cage and Cunningham maintained separate apartments until 1971, in what Larson chalks up to an abundance of caution.) But the leeway Larson gives herself always seems to earn out\u2014her readings of Bergmanesque self-torment in Cage\u2019s", "are persuasive, and fit sensibly enough in the composer\u2019s personal timeline, when he was growing apart from his wife and toward Cunningham. And this section also prepares readers for the more startling sections to come, in which, by reading her intuition alongside the known biographical facts, Larson allows herself to make broad, convincing arguments for Cage\u2019s magnetic power and pull over successive schools of artists.", "And oh yes, by the way, basically every artist who mattered in the 20", "century and who spent any time in America seems to make an appearance in this book: Duchamp, Pollock Warhol, Johns, Ono, and on and on\u2014the gang\u2019s all here. Larson proves to be a talented gumshoe, turning up house records thought lost from the Artists\u2019 Club, started by New York\u2019s downtown crew of renegade painters in 1949. (She just knocked on some old doors). Late in the book Larson quickens her pace as she clarifies Cage\u2019s impact on successive generations of American artistic practice\u2014Pop, Fluxus, the conceptual movements\u2014as well as to individual artists like", "and", ". These brief mentions could have sustained whole chapters.", "Given that richness, who cares if Larson\u2019s book isn\u2019t grounded in dense music-theory knowledge?

But Larson is after altogether different game, and playing by different rules. Cage was an unreliable enough narrator of his own life that he probably deserves at least one author willing to venture beyond the bounds of strict propriety in biography-writing.", "Take for example Cage\u2019s discovery of D.T. Suzuki, a twist other books don\u2019t narrate as confidently, since no one knows exactly how or when it transpired. Larson feels free to speculate\u2014and to tell us that she\u2019s doing so. There\u2019s a lot of slippery work throughout in between royal-we stuff and Larson\u2019s own voice, where \u201cwe\u2019re\u201d all of a sudden \u201cimagining\u201d Cage making his progress toward a complete spiritual overhaul at Suzuki\u2019s hands:", "", "It\u2019s 1949 or (most likely) 1950. We imagine Cage happily browsing in Orientalia, casually flipping open book covers, and being stopped in his tracks by the first page of [Suzuki\u2019s]", "and its stunning first sentence \u2026 At this point, if I were Cage, I would buy the book and take it home.", "Via Wikimedia Commons.", "The dangers here are evident. And yet, in part because Cage told different stories, over time, about this period in his life, there are things Larson (or any biographer) can\u2019t know.
