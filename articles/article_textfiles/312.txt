The particular flavor of Saunders\u2019 fiction combines pathos with a submerged but fiercely sardonic humor. His characters are typically pitiable\u2014hirelings and underdogs, experimental subjects and neglected children, the cowed members of families and workplaces dominated by unchecked malignant narcissists\u2014but each one harbors a tiny flame of decency that remains stubbornly lit despite the humiliations and disappointments heaped upon him. They cling to false comforts, flimsy self-help nostrums, and dreams corrupted by marketing kitsch (\u201cWhen will I have sufficient leisure/wealth to sit on hay bale watching moon rise, while in luxurious mansion family sleeps? At that time, will have chance to reflect deeply on meaning of life, etc., etc.\u201d), but it is the clinging itself, and their refusal to jettison their own nagging consciences, that makes them heroic. You could argue,", ", that the accentuated irony in Saunders\u2019 fiction, the gap between how the characters view their plight and how the reader perceives it, flatters his audience\u2019s superior understanding. But I\u2019ve always suspected that Saunders regards such knowingness as merely a more sophisticated mirage: Just because you\u2019ve clocked how power and consumer capitalism operate doesn\u2019t make you any less their bitch.", "Now comes Saunders\u2019 long-awaited first novel, just at the moment when his capacity to hold onto that slender thread of humanity running through the direst social circumstances seems most needed. And it is \u2026 a historical novel. About grief. And Abraham Lincoln. It\u2019s not that", "isn\u2019t worthwhile. It has many moments of power, and even passages of the sort of lushly sensual prose that hasn\u2019t previously been a Saunders specialty. It definitely marks an advance into new formal territory. It\u2019s just that the timing on this thing is really, really bad. A George Saunders novel seems like just what we need right now, but chances are", "is not the George Saunders novel you\u2019re looking for.", "is set in a Washington cemetery in 1862, amid the resident population of ghosts. Using a format that combines a playlike assemblage of voices alternating with chapters composed of quotations from historical sources, it depicts how the ghosts respond to the arrival of Willie Lincoln, the president\u2019s son, who died of typhoid at age 11. Lincoln himself appears, the night after his son\u2019s funeral, pulling the dead boy\u2019s body out of its coffin to embrace it. This causes a sensation in the cemetery because, as one of the spirits puts it, \u201cto be touched so lovingly, so fondly, as if one were still \u2026 worthy of affection and respect? It was cheering. It gave us hope.\u201d", "Those ghosts who linger in the graveyard do so because they can\u2019t relinquish some attachment to what they refer to as \u201cthe previous place\u201d: three daughters left in the care of a loathed husband; a lifetime\u2019s worth of jealously hoarded possessions; a body of unpublished scholarly work demonstrating the author\u2019s \u201cgenius.\u201d The two primary speakers are a frustrated bridegroom, felled by a building collapse just before his marriage could be consummated, and a young man who killed himself in despair over his homosexuality only to regret the loss of the beautiful world when it was too late. The bridegroom appears to other specters with an enormous erection; the suicide appears as a freakish vision with multiple noses and sets of eyes, rhapsodizing about the glories of the senses: \u201c\u2026the peach orchards and haystacks and young girls and ancient wild meadows drove him nearly mad with their beauty, and strange animals moved in lazy mobs along muddy rivers, rivers crossable only with the aid of some old rowing hermit who spoke a language barely English, and all of it, all of that bounty, was for everyone, for everyone to use, seemingly put here to teach a man to be free.\u201d", "Most of these ghosts refuse to acknowledge that they\u2019re dead and clutch at the hope that they can somehow communicate with, and affect, those still residing in \u201cthe previous place.\u201d They are subjected to visitations from radiant beings who try to persuade them to \u201cgo on,\u201d promising them paradise in the next place, but the revenants shun these demonic tempters and regard the ghosts who succumb, leaving the cemetery forever, with pity. The longer the ghosts remain, the more diminished they become, reduced to tiny forms symbolic of the desires they can\u2019t relinquish.", "The bardo is an element of Tibetan Buddhism, a way station between incarnations in which souls prepare themselves for their next life. The novel\u2019s title, and the role of attachment in detaining the spirits in their limbolike semi-existence, suggests an underlying Buddhist cosmology. But one of the ghosts, a former reverend, claims to have glimpsed beyond this world a place of terrible judgment and punishment, so it\u2019s possible that Saunders means the afterlife to be a reflection of whatever the individual soul expects to see. One thing is certain: The ghosts of children who tarry in the cemetery are in great peril, subject to a horrific transformation in which they become encased in a carapace of tiny, teeming, angry souls (a scenario with an unsettling resemblance to the body thetans of Scientology doctrine).", "Why this should be the case, nobody knows. Jaded readers may suspect that Saunders needed to contrive a selfless cause\u2014saving Willie\u2014to unite all the ghosts in a group effort, thereby providing a plot and the opportunity for redemption in community. The metaphysical apparatus must be explained to some extent, and those explanations are both a bit tedious and at odds with the moral center of the book, which is the grief of Lincoln.", "Amazon", "Lincoln was a great man, and the loss of a child is a shattering blow to absorb\u2014especially if you also happen to be a leader of conscience aware that your decisions will cost other parents their own sons. As for the ghosts themselves, they persist in a suspended state familiar to any reader of Samuel Beckett, a condition only slightly more existentially pointless than that occupied by the living. The subjects of loss and mortal regret are momentous ones, which probably explains why (to the browsing critic, at least) seemingly every other literary novel is about grief. Anyone can write a \u201cserious\u201d novel when they choose such serious themes, which is why, in addition to the great ones, so many mediocre writers with nothing especially interesting to say are drawn to them.", "Very few writers, however, can write about the crap we actually live with\u2014theme parks and lawn ornaments and customer service reps and petty autocrats\u2014in a way that teases out the desperation and cruelty lurking within. Fewer still can also make you laugh while they\u2019re doing it.
