Because the legislation contains the word \u201cpenalty\u201d and because words mean what words mean, the dissent insists on a reading that sees dictionary definitions of \u201ctax\u201d and \u201cpenalty\u201d as mutually exclusive. Given the scope and significance of the new law, this may be some indication of how significant certain dictionaries weirdly still are.", "Now, exactly how\u2014and how often\u2014judges use the dictionary depends partly on their philosophies of interpretation.

It\u2019s absurd, then, to think there might be a singular \u201clegislative intent\u201d behind any statute. The same goes for readings of the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d instead of its \u201cletter\u201d or a belief in the \u201cLiving Constitution.\u201d Absurdities all.
