The new longer-playing records would be more durable than the standard 78s as well as, overall, less expensive: One 12-inch long-playing record featuring an entire symphony would cost $4.85, compared with $7.25 for an album of five conventional 78s containing the same symphony.", "Wallerstein\u2019s announcement was astounding, and the public greeted the news enthusiastically. The very first long-playing recording, of Nathan Milstein performing Mendelssohn\u2019s", "with the New York Philharmonic, Bruno Walter conducting, appeared in shops only a week after the press conference. By the end of 1948, Columbia had sold 1,250,000 long-playing records.", "Nearly as remarkable as Columbia\u2019s announcement, in retrospect, was the refusal of its archrival, RCA Victor, to enter the long-playing field. CBS management had quietly apprised David Sarnoff, the head of RCA, about the breakthrough in April 1948, months ahead of the public announcement, with an offer to license the technology. Columbia presumed that if all the record companies released some version of the LP, the public\u2019s acceptance of and adaptation to the new format would proceed all the more smoothly. Wallerstein repeated the offer at the Waldorf press conference. Most of the other recording companies agreed, but RCA turned it down and, early in 1949, announced its own new development of a 7-inch unbreakable record that would play at 45-rpm. No less interested than Columbia in finding a solution to the problems in playing long-form musical pieces on 78s, RCA had developed a rapid record changer, which would allow listeners to stack a large number of records around oversized spindles above the turntable. The records, which played at 45 rpm, would then quickly and automatically drop to the turntable in ordered succession, creating a virtually uninterrupted flow of music. The goal was the same as that of CBS\u2019s microgroove LP; RCA simply pursued it with a different technology. Now, rather than switch to Columbia\u2019s long-play technology, RCA would fight.", "What has since been called \u201cthe battle of the speeds\u201d continued for more than a year. Finally, in January 1950, having lost $4.5 million as well as some valuable artists such as the opera singer Ezio Pinza (other artists including Artur Rubenstein and Jascha Heifetz were threatening to leave as well), RCA threw in the towel and announced it would market its own 33\u2153-rpm long-playing records. RCA\u2019s efforts with the rapid record changer were not totally futile; indeed, for 30 years the 45 would be the industry\u2019s favored medium for pop singles, as well as for automatic jukeboxes, which benefited from RCA\u2019s new changer design. (Columbia even began issuing its own 45s in 1951.) But for most record buyers, Columbia\u2019s victory in the speeds battle provided reassurance that the 33\u2153-rpm LP was not a gimmick and could be purchased with confidence for every variety of music.", "The LP revolution would change the way classical, jazz, pop, and theatrical music would be recorded. And the company\u2019s popularization of high-fidelity, stereo recording\u2014\u201c360 Sound\u201d\u2014in the 1950s changed things yet again. Columbia\u2019s midcentury roster of talent seized these opportunities to record some of the greatest music ever made.", "Sean Wilentz is a professor of history and director of the program in American studies at Princeton University.", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
