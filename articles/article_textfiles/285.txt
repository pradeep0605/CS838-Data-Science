What 2015 books were my favorites? Surprisingly little fiction. I enjoyed a dozen or so novels, but fell in love with only three. Fortunately, short stories, comics, and especially memoirs (as well as the memoir\u2019s most eloquent defender) stepped in to fill the gap. Some say that as you get older, you come to value the information nonfiction has to offer more than the beguiling dreams of fiction.

The memoir still comes in for a lot of knee-jerk abuse, and parts of this book defend the form ably. Karr can be bracingly frank about her dislike for memoirists who blatantly \u201cmake shit up\u201d (as opposed to acknowledging the fallibility of memory), and she can rhapsodize with the best of them over the idiosyncratic beauty of her favorite literary genre.

Link makes the sort of fictional world in which people have the ability to access pocket universes, but mostly use it to take posh vacations and dump their trash. Yet in her stories, the shiver of the sublime is never far away. This collection, Link\u2019s first for adults in a decade, opens with perhaps the most perfect modern fairy tale ever written, a precious thing meant to be savored and revisited, however long we have to wait for more Kelly Link.", "Like all of Johnson\u2019s keen but fundamentally humane satires of race relations and cross-cultural obtuseness,", "is high-end fusion: a little bit gothic, a little bit Nerdungsroman, a little bit up-to-date comedy of manners.

After years of lying low overseas, Warren returns to the ramshackle Pennsylvania mansion, located in the middle of a poor black neighborhood, that he inherits from his white father.

But", "is largely the tale of a glorious career that produced so many great books, and an observant, compassionate life: Sacks made friends with poets and madmen, bikers and Venice Beach weightlifters, scientists, artists and politicians. He treated people whose conditions might have seemed merely bizarre to the casual observer and showed us how to recognize the beauty in their experiences, however difficult. \u201cI am a storyteller, for better or for worse,\u201d Sacks writes on the last page.

The central character, a recent college graduate seeking her long-lost father in hope that he\u2019ll help pay off her student loans, gets mixed up with a Julian Assange\u2013like Internet activist and a pair of middle-aged investigative journalists.

And in one epic saga, Beaton recounts the travails and redemption of an extra from a 1986 Janet Jackson video, including his stint in St. Jude\u2019s Home for the Nasty. Along with a finely tuned sense of comic timing, Beaton has an unerring eye for the human folly at the heart of great works of art and great moments in history, which is why her work only gets funnier each time you read it.", "The narrator of this marvelously worldly debut novel, redolent of Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, is an aide-de-camp to a South Vietnamese general during the war, but also a mole for the North Vietnamese communists.
