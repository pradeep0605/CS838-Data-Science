I mostly use them as a food shelf, a cellphone case, and an in-flight pillow. When I was young and single and had less self-esteem, I used to joke that my breasts were \"all I had\" (good one, unhappy baby self!), but now that I'm older, I don\u2019t have to rely on them to feel beautiful\u2014for the time being, they're just parts of me that fill my clothes and make my back hurt and, sure, make me feel pretty sometimes.

(\"Well, at least your breasts won't spontaneously ignite!\" her husband jokes, because that's exactly what you want to hear when adjusting to the news that you're a human baby-poison factory.) This sends her down a rabbit hole in search of deeper understanding of her own anatomy\u2014 into the evolutionary history of mammals, to Peru to investigate nursing and weaning, back to the first breast augmentation surgery, and all over the world to interview more boob experts than you can shake a pasty at.", "And she discovers that breasts are", ". Impossibly so. She learns that it\u2019s the breast\u2019s permeability that make it such an evolutionary powerhouse (lots and lots of estrogen receptors help human puberty occur at the optimal time; nutrient-rich breast milk makes for giant brains)\u2014but that same permeability is also, partially, what causes one in eight women to develop breast cancer. Our breasts make us great but they also make us vulnerable, and you can\u2019t help but come away from Williams\u2019 book feeling a bit helpless. (Self-examinations! Self-examinations are key!) While she makes the story as dynamic as possible, there\u2019s no escaping that this is science journalism\u2014there are lots of PBDE levels and octa-203 and penta-47 and dioxin and \u201clobule type 4\u201d and other such enemies of lively prose.

Here\u2019s a partial list from Williams: \u201cpaint thinners, dry-cleaning fluids, wood preservatives, toilet deodorizers, cosmetic additives, gasoline by-products, rocket fuel, termite poisons, fungicides, and flame-retardants.\" So what can you do to keep your chest-sponges safe from marauding chemicals?

Which, of course, is exactly how it\u2019s supposed to be\u2014but it\u2019s not surprising that so many women are leery of breast-feeding. On top of that, breasts (at least in rhesus macaque monkeys, whose milk is similar to humans) can actually determine whether a nursing baby is a boy or a girl, and adjust their milk production accordingly. Milk for girls is thin but abundant, while boy milk is fattier and scarcer\u2014the theory being that girls then must stick closer to their mothers for frequent feedings, thus absorbing their social roles, while boys are easily sated and have time to play and explore.

Ninety percent of women with breast cancer have no known family history of the disease. Just as perplexingly, she notes, \u201cmost women with the risk factors, even a bunch of them, still never get breast cancer. In other words, the standard risk factors are fairly useless.\u201d", "Photograph by Corrynn Cochran.", "So basically, if you want to find out your risk for breast cancer, you might as well just duct-tape a stethoscope and a mustache to a Magic 8 Ball and ask him.

And then there\u2019s the issue that mammograms themselves, which use radiation, could actually be dangerous for women who are at the highest risk of breast cancer. (It might sound tempting to hypochondriacally forgo mammograms altogether, but I\u2019d rather let a trustworthy doctor make those decisions.) Breast self-exams, or BSEs, Williams argues, are a vital detection tool\u2014if we can educate women to actually perform them properly, instead of \u201chalf-assed shower gropings.\u201d", "Williams actually purchases a fake, cancer-ridden practice breast from Amazon.com\u2014and works it over like some sort of tumor-ridden petting zoo (adorable!). But when it comes to her actual human breasts, she discovers, exploration isn\u2019t so straightforward: \u201cIt was harder (and painful) to push down very far through all my natural ropy tissue. If I were to develop cancer, I\u2019d have to hope for shallow tumors.\u201d So, OK, it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cfeel yourself up,\u201d although the commitment to trying is a valuable step.
