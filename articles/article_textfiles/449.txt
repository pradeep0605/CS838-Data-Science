{"Body": ["Illustration by Jess Fink", "In the early morning, a few hours after the bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square that the Chinese, to this day, officially term the \u201cJune 4", "Incident,\u201d a young writer named Liao Yiwu penned and performed a poem titled \u201cMassacre, \u201d mourning the young lives lost. Liao neither participated in the student protests nor knew directly of its principal architects. After all, he was half a country away on the muddy banks of the Yangtze, the longest river in China. But in February 1990, he traveled to the Third Military Medical University in Chongqing to meet a friend who had agreed to record a performance of \u201cMassacre.\u201d For this counter-revolutionary activity, he would spend the next four years of his life behind bars\u2014an experience he recounts in his jailhouse memoir,", ". Picking up the work of a fellow Sichuanese, I hadn\u2019t been quite sure what to expect. The memoir, the first two drafts of which were confiscated by police, is at once brutal and brutally funny. But until I read", ", I never knew how easily our paths could have crossed on the university campus where he became a criminal and I was born.", "I was named for the Yangtze River, and I knew the arched maroon gates of the Third Military Medical University before I could read the block characters spelling its name. For a long time, I believed that universities, or \u201cbig school,\u201d as it is translated literally from the Chinese, only came in the \u201cmilitary medical\u201d variety because they were the only ones\u2014 \u201cthe First Military Medical Big School,\u201d \u201cthe Second Military Medical Big School\u201d\u2014my mother and her friends ever named.", "Courtesy of Elisabeth Bernstein", "Likewise, my understanding of our own military affiliation\u2014both my parents worked and trained at the university\u2014was unsubtle: Those who periodically sported green uniforms, which were all the adults I knew, connoted safety and sanctuary. Those who did not were \u201clocal,\u201d and therefore liable to lead me astray. How differently Liao, the freewheeling liberal intellectual and proud \u201clocal,\u201d must have viewed his captors\u2014the same uncles I was instructed to trust if I ever found myself lost beyond the gates of our army compound.", "Like much of the middle-aged population in today\u2019s China, Liao was born in one of the worst famines in Chinese history, one that was entirely man-made. A full stomach might have been out of the question, but Liao\u2019s schoolteacher father made sure to supply his son with a steady diet of ancient Chinese poetry and essays. For this reason, language never proved laborious for Liao. \u201cWords poured out of me in buckets,\u201d he writes of his early career. So, it seems, did a bristling bravado. At the height of the student protests, Liao confesses that it was the failure of his poetry \u201cto vanquish the capital,\u201d rather than frustration with politics, that produced his most enduring feelings of bitterness and cynicism.", "Still, revolution does not elude the young poet. He repeats to himself the party anthem: \u201cThe blood which fills my chest has boiled over/ We must struggle for truth!\u201d When he wrote of the \u201chistorically unprecedented massacre\u201d in his poem\u2014a massacre the communist government sought to erase from public memory\u2014the truth he pursued bent perilously close to the state\u2019s definition of treason.", "Liao is a born observer. Without pen and paper, he mentally collects stories from convicts who converged like \u201cdregs sinking to the bottom of a sewage pipe,\u201d yet who re-create with uncanny accuracy \u201can exact replica of the state bureaucracy outside.\u201d Inside prison, \u201cthose in power enjoyed unlimited privileges\u201d; Liao describes, as an example, the allocation of a fundamental resource: \u201cThe chief could use scented napkins to wipe his butt, but slave thieves had to resort to using wrapping paper or old newspapers.\u201d", "Liao\u2019s meticulous portrait of the societal microcosm between cell walls\u2014replete with its cast of foreign ministers, chairmen, scholars, and counter-revolutionaries\u2014reads like a hybrid of Swift and Orwell, the latter of whom Liao reads with surreal astonishment in prison. Corruption, nepotism, and ineptitude run rampant, while in-house political campaigns\u2014titled \u201cConfess Your Own Crimes and Report on Others\u201d\u2014systematically weaken any rebellious momentum the prisoners might build among themselves.", "Ironically, what binds Liao and his handcuffed comrades, other than shared deprivations, is the cultural legacy and currency of communism. If stepping into the detention center is like walking into a foreign country, Maoisms\u2014verses and phrases trademarked to the Great Chairman\u2014seem like that country\u2019s official tongue. On his first day of imprisonment, Liao defends his own personal dignity with a Maoism: \u201cChairman Mao used to say that people are the parents of the Party, not the other way around.\u201d Later, Liao is humiliated and driven to the brink of suicide not by a beating but rather by the demeaning manner in which a prison officer appropriates that same Maoism: \u201cA communist official is like your parent,\u201d he barks. \u201cWhen a child doesn\u2019t behave himself in front of his parents, he deserves punishment!\u201d", "As a child, I was used to hearing these dictums. In 1990, as Liao experimented with the subversion of propaganda, my classmates and I\u2014along with millions of first graders across China\u2014were in the throes of its indoctrination. Just as plainly as one and one added up to two, we learned, communism commanded the world and criminals deserved incarceration. To hammer the message home, our first-grade class took several trips a year to the Zhajidong, a notorious nearby prison, where we were lectured on the menu of torture techniques the nationalists imposed upon our forefathers, the communist defenders.", "Unbeknownst to me, Liao was only five minutes away, and on the receiving end of these menu items. \u201cDamn, my life is over,\u201d Liao mutters on his fateful ride to the Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau Investigation Center. In one respect, Liao was right. The life he knew as a relatively sheltered intellectual came to an end the moment he was stripped of clothing and dignity upon arrival. In another, his discovery of injustice and violence\u2014which he had previously only conjured, as a cause, through the abstraction of poetry\u2014became as real as the walls of his new hell.", "During the four years chronicled in", ", his own family disintegrates: A daughter is born, a wife is lost, a mother mourns her son\u2019s reckless ambition. In the summer of 1992, as Liao conjured the face of his newborn daughter from behind prison bars, I was getting ready to see my own father, a Third Military Medical University graduate. In many respects, Liao and my father share a personal history. Both came of age in the Great Famine, love literature despite a relative lack of formal schooling, and admit addiction to the numbing effects of Sichuanese peppercorns. As luck would have it, my father had even studied for his GREs in the very same language lab where Liao was arrested.", "Whereas Liao chose poetry and the artistic avant-garde, however, my father chose science and the army and, eventually, life in America. While Liao heard the rally cries of students in downtown Chongqing, my father was safely ensconced in a small dorm room an ocean away, puzzling out the events of his native land in a language he was still struggling to comprehend.", "Four long years after my mother began her visa application, she was informed one day in early spring by university administrators\u2014men from the same department as the ones that arrested Liao\u2014that we had a chance of being processed after all. My mother, who\u2019d lived like a widow (or worse, a divorcee) for years, was giddy with anticipation. This was a secret, of course, she told me behind closed doors. No one could know. No friends. No teachers. No classmates. As an extra precaution, my mother asked me to repeat after her a set of rehearsed answers if I were ever faced with an impromptu interrogation.", "Two weeks, at most.", "To see my father and bring him home to the Third Military Medical University.", "This was a no-brainer. In first grade, I had already become a Young Pioneer. I was the head cadre of our grade and led the class every morning in the national anthem. The blood which filled my chest could be no less red than the billowing flag.", "", "The Motherland, I told my mother. What other country was there?", "---", "by Liao Yiwu.
