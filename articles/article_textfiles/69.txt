Although the 29-year-old chef is cooking at a successful restaurant, also called Seconds, she\u2019s agonizing about opening an even better one, not to mention her winsome ex and a desultory affair. The first time she\u2019s desperate enough to try this mushroom-based ritual, her motivations are relatively selfless. But the newfound ability to revise reality over and over again encourages Katie\u2019s worst tendencies, making her manipulative and neurotic: Instead of repairing her life, she hungers to perfect it.
