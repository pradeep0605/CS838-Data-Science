{"Body": ["Illustration by Laura Terry.", "Picture a hospice: walls painted soothing colors, landscapes hanging in the rooms, compassionate nurses at bedsides. And patients living out their last days in relative comfort\u2014not at home, true, but also not in the cold, impersonal, constantly beeping confines of a hospital. With the patients are their dearest, constant companions, who are petting them gently, offering them bacon-flavored treats, rubbing their tummies. In this hospice, the patients are dogs.", "It\u2019s not that far-fetched a notion, according to animal bioethicist Jessica Pierce, whose thoughtful new book", "asks what a \u201chumane\u201d death for a pet should look like. The vast majority of pets in this country die by euthanization. But there are few rules\u2014legal or moral\u2014about the end of a pet\u2019s life. We are charged with judging when \u201cit\u2019s time,\u201d but what does that mean? And do we owe it to our pets, and by implication, ourselves, to try to provide them with an end that more closely mirrors our own?", "Pierce asks these questions in chapters that are interspersed with a journal she kept during the last year of her dog Ody\u2019s life. Watching Ody\u2019s condition degenerate to the point where he can no longer walk was particularly difficult, because Ody\u2019s demise almost exactly paralleled that of my own dog, Lee, whom I put down in November 2010. According to Pierce\u2019s journal, it was in that same month that she finally faced the reality of Ody\u2019s condition and had him euthanized.", "Above all, though, Pierce wants to explore the question of what constitutes, for a pet, a \u201cgood death,\u201d one that is", "free of unnecessary pain, suffering, and fear; it is peaceful. And it takes place in the presence of compassionate witnesses. It is, above all, a death that is allowed its full meaning. Is it strange to say that we might desire for the death of an animal to be meaningful? Can the ultimate act of obliteration have meaning? Yes. It can and does.", "Every dog owner\u2014or at least, every decent one\u2014asks herself at the end of her dog\u2019s life whether she could have done more. More to prolong her dog\u2019s life and more to ease her dog\u2019s pain, but also more Beggin\u2019 Strips and arthritis pills wrapped in salami. More petting. More licks. More snuggling.", "The nature of survivor\u2019s guilt is such that the answer is almost always yes\u2014and Pierce seems to struggle with finding where this line is. It\u2019s hard not to feel empathy with her\u2014and yet, in her explorations of what it means to have done \u201cas much\u201d as she could have is a touch of the dog-person-martyr. After all, we are talking about an animal who, by Pierce\u2019s own description, had trouble walking, was listless, pooped explosively in Pierce\u2019s house almost every day, and was mostly deaf and blind. \u201cOne of the avenues I wish I had explored more carefully for Ody,\u201d she writes, \u201care the nondrug therapeutic alternatives such as canine rehabilitation, physical therapy, massage, laser therapy, and acupuncture.\u201d She writes matter-of-factly of dog wheelchairs, which she admits cost around $500, but that nonetheless allow a dog whose hindquarters are paralyzed to \u201cwalk, run, swim, pee, poop, and generally smell the roses.\u201d", "It was difficult, at first, for me to read Pierce\u2019s words without thinking:", ". In the last two weeks of Lee\u2019s life, her back legs were paralyzed, and to walk her I had to lift up her back half\u2014which was dead weight\u2014in a sling, and try to get all 55 pounds of her downstairs without her peeing by the elevator in my building. But reading Ody\u2019s story I had the fleeting thought that I should\u2019ve bought Lee a wheelchair so she could have eked out, I don\u2019t know, another few months of life.", "But then I thought, hell no. Those last couple of weeks were terrible and trying, for both of us. She mostly stayed in the corner of my apartment. She barely ate. She seemed supremely bummed out, even though it was unclear whether she realized exactly what had happened to her. (Vet consensus was no.) So if I\u2019d gotten her a dog wheelchair, maybe she would\u2019ve been able to roll around for a little while longer, but her quality of life would\u2019ve, frankly, sucked.", "After Lee had her stroke, Pierce probably would have suggested that I evaluate Lee\u2019s condition on the scale developed by a vet named Alice Villalobos, who is on staff at a Southern California pet hospice called Pawspice. (One of the enduring mysteries of life is why dogs, Thai restaurants, and hair salons inspire such terrible puns.) Pierce explains that Villalobos\u2019 scale asks pet owners to evaluate their sick or elderly pets based on hurt, hunger, hydration, hygiene, happiness, and mobility on a 1-10 scale. A total score of 35 or more is acceptable, while under 35 \u201csuggests that euthanasia may be the best option.\u201d I considered Lee\u2019s condition retroactively, and tallied a score of 19.", "In Pierce\u2019s view, merely making these considerations is a step in the right direction. Ideally, though, she seems to envision a world of animal palliative care that seems unrealistic to execute on a large scale and also prohibitively expensive\u2014it is unlikely that most pet owners will, toward the end of their pets\u2019 lives, provide them with hospice care. But what", "seem possible is that a small minority of pet owners with the resources and desire to do so will begin to explore these new frontiers in animal aging, and will thus inspire changes for the rest of us. \u201cAnimal hospice broadens the possibilities and stimulates creative thinking about how our animals can die and what compassionate care can look like,\u201d Pierce writes. \u201cHospice offers us a gentler way down into the Valley of Death, a slow path down that we can travel hand-in-paw with our animal rather than shoving them brusquely off a precipice.\u201d", "Courtesy of the author.", "That\u2019s inspiring, and I believe she\u2019s right about what hospice care can accomplish. But this passage also illustrates one of the more frustrating aspects of", ": Pierce tends to think mostly in sentimental dichotomy, assuming that if we are not riding off \u201chand-in-paw\u201d with our pets, then we are \u201cshoving them brusquely off a precipice.\u201d Like her own decision to finally euthanize Ody, though, it\u2019s clear that for most pet owners, there\u2019s less brusque shoving than heart-wrenching decisions made, more often than not, out of love. I was standing in the hallway outside my office when the vet told me gently that my options for Lee were running out\u2014she'd failed to respond to the steroids she was on, and her days were only likely to get worse. Crying, I told her I'd bring Lee in the next day.", "Still, Pierce's point that we could be thinking more humanely (I can almost hear her cursing that person-centric term) about our pets\u2019 deaths is important, and even when Lee died, I saw some of the changes that Pierce hopes to come to fruition on a broader scale. She writes often of her fear of having Ody die in a cold, soulless hospital, where the \u201cblue needle\u201d would finally kill him, but when I had Lee euthanized, it was done in a homey, comfortable room with a couch and rugs on the floor, and there wasn\u2019t an IV or a steel table in sight.", "---", "by Jessica Pierce.
