Today, in one of those serendipitous coincidences that buoy his poetry, Muldoon\u2019s forecast sounds like utter understatement.

It reveals, amid Muldoon\u2019s kaleidoscopic variations, the axiom underlying all his poetry: that no categories are truly stable, that everything inhabits a fuzzy in-betweenness. In Muldoon\u2019s slant-rhymed take on our world, identities are always in flux, allegiances always partial, borders teetered over, messages mistranslated, feelings incurably mixed.", "Suspended between influences\u2014W.

Muldoon\u2019s subjects could be mythical, or cryptozoological: centaurs, mermen, yetis, \u2019shroom-fueled hallucinations of talking horse heads. More often, they revisited his early years in Northern Ireland, barking a carnival of mixed marriages, disastrous dinner dates, cease-fires, and self-fashioning teenagers. Muldoon\u2019s most distilled mission statement, an early poem called \u201cMules,\u201d starts with a smirk: \u201cShould they not have the best of both worlds?\u201d Muldoon celebrates \u201cwhat was neither one thing nor the other,\u201d neither donkey nor horse, lowly yet heavenly, born into our fallen world with an afterbirth \u201cTrailed like some fine, silk parachute,/ That we would know from what heights it fell.\u201d Muldoon\u2019s sparse narratives could start anywhere and end anywhere else, forgoing symmetries for free-associative triple jumps and world-traversing butterfly effects.
