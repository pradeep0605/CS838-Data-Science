Unlike those other guys, Leyner never quit. In the quarter century since he emerged fully formed from the wilds of bourgeois New Jersey, he has etched indelible paragraphs compounded of glossy doublespeak and PR lingo, heightened with sublime visions of a thrill-ride dystopia, and tapped out to a stirring rhythm.

The density and intensity give the impression of listening to a very concise logorrheic.", "is a radioactive birth-of-the-author fantasy about Mark Leyner, who reads as a science-fiction grotesque of a vintage contemporary. At one point, he writes about teaching a writing workshop, where the phalanx of androids guarding his body aren\u2019t quite enough: \u201cSince I don\u2019t like to carry a firearm when I conduct a writing workshop\u2014I\u2019ve found it tends to inhibit people who haven\u2019t yet developed a confident style of their own\u2014I\u2019ll come with an icepick in my sock.\u201d", "Such marvelous aggression!

(The author declared, immortally, \"I think it's important for you to mention that I not only want to be the best comic novelist in America, but the best-built comic novelist in America.\") This is the passion juicing the prose.
