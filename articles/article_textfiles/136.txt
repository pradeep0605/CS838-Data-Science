{"Body": ["Illustration by Liana Finck", "Sometime in the early months of 2008, Karl Ove Knausgaard, by then 39 years old and the author of two novels, invented for himself a new style of narration. It would dispense with the pretense of fictionality, and its defining characteristic would be the highest possible degree of authenticity: What fictional details were present wouldn\u2019t be distinguished from what was real, and it would give the impression that everything, no matter how banal, was being told. Many of the rules of storytelling, some of them so basic to the way we tell stories that we hardly think of them as rules, would be discarded. Time and place would shift abruptly, and so would the mode of speaking, from a litany of humdrum household tasks on one page, to philosophical reflections and speculations on the next, to events of a high dramatic quotient on a third. The reader would have to be ready at any time for the author\u2019s personal theory of art or his personal hygiene routine. Digressions would nest within digressions, for dozens of pages at a time. The writer, in the name of speed, of getting it all down, would abandon many aspects of literary artifice\u2014first among them, what we might term \u201cgood writing.\u201d Most of what he had to say would be telegraphed in plain language, and the majority of his lapses into the figurative would come in the form of clich\u00e9s and mixed metaphors.", "The result was", ", a confessional outpouring that became a sensation and a scandal in Knausgaard\u2019s native Norway. In Norwegian the title is", ", and in German", "\u2014the book shares its title, in other words, with the manifesto Adolf Hitler wrote in the 1920s. (Book Six reportedly contains 400 pages on Hitler, and how Knausgaard links this up to his own life remains a matter of some suspense for English readers.) The book sold roughly half a million copies in Norway, equal to about one-tenth of the country\u2019s population. Bitter public disputes followed, particularly between Knausgaard and his estranged ex-wife\u2014who made a radio documentary called", ", in which he participated\u2014and his uncle, who attacked him in the press. Knausgaard\u2019s second wife, Linda, to whom he is still married, relapsed into depression on the publication of", ".", "In the Anglophone world, the response has focused less on the plight of one Norwegian family than on Knausgaard\u2019s innovations. The publication of", "in English", "has coincided with an autobiographical turn among younger novelists in North America, among them Tao Lin (", "), Sheila Heti (", "), and Ben Lerner (", "). These writers also make extensive use of essayistic digression. The roman \u00e0 clef has been around as long as the novel, of course, and it has always been subject to a standard set of criticisms: narcissism, laziness, failures of discretion to the point of betrayal. Knausgaard has triumphed by committing the maximum of all three sins.", "Despite the presence of the first-person singular pronoun in the title,", "has been praised for its universalizing qualities. Its appeal is especially universal for middle-aged writers who also happen to be married parents. Knausgaard conveys the situation neatly early on in", ":", "It is writing \u201csomething exceptional\u201d that will give Knausgaard\u2019s life meaning, and it is his family life that\u2019s the main obstacle in accomplishing it. His solution is to make family life the content of his writing, its source of meaning. And the passage above shows the compromises Knausgaard the prose writer has made at the sentence level (the gnawing rat, that sand through his fingers), but also the velocity he achieves by heaping his (often very lengthy) paragraphs with unlingered-over detail. Note too the rather easy way he conceptualizes his children as a \u201csuperior force\u201d that have descended to oppress him.", "The first volume of", "begins with an abstract but highly romanticized account of death conquering a human body, \u201cenormous hordes of bacteria that begin to infiltrate the body\u2019s innards,\u201d followed by the child Karl Ove\u2019s first glimpse of death in the form of a lifeless face floating in the ocean on a TV news report. It ends with a flashback-filled, 200-page account of the death of Knausgaard\u2019s alcoholic father and the cleaning out of his senile grandmother\u2019s home\u2014a mess of medicine-cabinet refuse, dead insects, shit, and piss stains. In between much time is spent with the teenage Karl Ove and his adolescent passions\u2014music, film, art, girls\u2014as well as his own discovery of alcohol. A long digressive account of a New Year\u2019s Eve displays Knausgaard\u2019s trick of delayed gratification that ends up forgoing gratification altogether.", "Photo courtesyAsbjorn Jensen", "Knausgaard the husband and father is the presiding persona in", ", and here the stress falls more pervasively on the conflict between family and intellectual life. This is often expressed as a crisis of masculinity, and the humiliating details of child care, the ones usually kept private, perhaps for the children\u2019s sake, are on full display. In the narrative\u2019s foreground, Knausgaard is living in Stockholm with Linda and their children, and his best friend is a writer named Geir, author of", ", about a Stockholm boxing club. In the boxing club, Knausgaard explains, \u201cthe values that the welfare state had otherwise subverted, such as masculinity, honor, violence and pain, were upheld, and the interest for me lay in how different society looked when viewed from that angle, with the set of values they had retained.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a different view from those where we most often see Knausgaard in", ": pushing a stroller or a grocery cart. His admiration for the values of an earlier epoch leads Knausgaard to think about \u201cmisology,\u201d which he calls \u201cthe distrust of words,\u201d and about which he wonders: \u201cwas that a way to go for a writer?\u201d He continues: \u201cliterature is not just words, literature is what words evoke in the reader. It is this transcendence that validates literature, not the formal transcendence in itself, as many believe.\u201d This emphasis on the content of literature, against or at the expense of its formal qualities, leads him to a statement about his own project:", "In light of remarks like these, and Knausgaard\u2019s repeated calls in the first two volumes for an art that reaches back to a time before the Enlightenment\u2014that does away with modern forms and psychologizing\u2014it makes sense that Book Three of", "adopts a more naturalistic mode. But this means doing away with some of the things that made the first two volumes so striking. After a brief introduction that situates the family in a new residence, a housing development called Tybakken on the island of Tromoya\u00a0 in the early 1970s, the essayistic mode fades away, and Knausgaard\u2019s adult authorial persona barely intrudes. With one exception: a brief passage midway through that splits the book, in which he wonders why his warm, loving mother is so much less present in his memories than his harsh (still pre-alcoholic) father. Gone, too, in this volume, are Knausgaard\u2019s manipulations of time; with some telescoping, the book proceeds linearly through Karl Ove\u2019s first school years on the island, breaking off when they move away to the town of Kristiansand. Many of the episodes in the third volume follow a distinct pattern: Karl Ove does something fairly innocent\u2014turns on the TV without permission, begs not to be made to wear a floral shower cap to swim class, loses a sock at the pool\u2014and incurs his father\u2019s wrath (or, if he\u2019s lucky, eludes it). The boy is always crying. Knausgaard enters into his childhood self thoroughly, and you start to miss his older self and his tendency to go on for pages about Dostoevsky or the Clash.", "But you start to notice something else about", "as a whole. Karl Ove\u2019s youthful playmates in", "start to seem disposable (and many of them drop from the story, and return or not, without much fanfare). They accompany him here and there, tempt him and tease him, but it would be an exaggeration to call them characters. He has too little sense of his own perspective to see them that way. Similarly, his father is the sum of his cruelties, and his mother her kindnesses. Even his older brother Yngve emerges as not much more than a figure who alternates between taunting and encouragement. And this is true of the elder Karl Ove of the first two volumes, the \u201cI\u201d that isn\u2019t Knausgaard the essayist: He\u2019s always reacting, always crashing into the limits of his perception, and trying to escape from traps. There\u2019s something feral about him. It\u2019s there in him when he\u2019s a boy defecating in the woods, and it\u2019s there when he\u2019s a man cutting up his own face after he first meets Linda and she rejects him. (He sheds that desperation within hours, takes his first wife to a Garbage concert, and declares it \u201cfantastic.\u201d)", "This isn\u2019t a shortcoming, but a goal, perhaps the goal, of Knausgaard\u2019s art, the source of its authenticity.
