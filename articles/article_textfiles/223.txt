While\u2014like just about everyone who\u2019s ever read her\u2014I tend to believe every single thing Karr says, that line brought me up short.

Of course, wonderful literary memoirs continue to be published: Two recent standouts include Helen Macdonald\u2019s", "and", "by Cheryl Strayed, a former student of Karr\u2019s. But the memoir no longer seems the juggernaut that once impelled nervous literati like William Gass to", ". I emailed the young literary agent Alia Hanna Habib to ask what the market is thinking these days. \u201cI think publishers would be much quicker to consider a fantastic novel by an unknown than a fantastic memoir by someone unknown,\u201d she wrote back.", "is part instruction for the would-be memoirist, part tribute to and defense of the form that Karr has adored since childhood and has", ". Karr loves the memoir because it is (or at least can be) beautifully, achingly evocative, like Nabokov\u2019s", "She also appreciates its democratic \u201canyone-who\u2019s-lived-can-write-one aspect.\u201d Memoirs by writers who faced daunting challenges, like Maya Angelou, offered Karr hope as a child \u201cthat I could someday grow up and get out of the mess I was in.\u201d And finally, for Karr, a good memoir is the closest thing you can get in book form to the unvarnished presence of an actual human being, unencumbered by the artifice of fiction. \u201cPretty much all the great memoirists I\u2019ve met,\u201d she writes, \u201csound on the page like they do in person. If the page is a mask, you rip it off only to find that the writer\u2019s features exactly mold to the mask\u2019s form, with nary a gap between public and private self.\u201d", "Despite Karr\u2019s assertion, it seems to me that the literary memoir is in decline\u2014or, rather, that it\u2019s being digested: broken down into parts and appropriated by a culture ravenous for first-person testimony. On the highbrow end of the spectrum, there is the episodic fiction of writers like", "and", ", whose mazy narratives are treated as nearly indistinguishable from autobiography. Habib reminded me that popular collections by essayists like", "and", ", which blend first-person confidences with reportage and cultural history, are in many respects memoir by another name. Meanwhile,", ", the Internet has commandeered the confessional role of the book-length memoir, particularly for women.", "Despite the memoir\u2019s perfectly respectable history, going all the way back to St. Augustine, its boom in the \u201990s and 2000s led to much establishment hand-wringing. Memoirs were dismissed as unseemly, sensationalistic, and subliterary. Even Atlas, who professed some respect for the form, linked its vogue to an unsavory social trend he described as \u201cconfessing in public to an audience of voyeurs\u201d; Gass, in his own cane-shaking tirade, condemned memoirists as exhibitionistic narcissists eager to embrace \u201cthe ultimate plurality of our selfishness\u201d in which we each \u201cperform our person to an empty house.\u201d", "People don\u2019t want to read your account of unmitigated suffering unless you\u2019re going to hand out a little hope as they file through the exit.", "Gass and fellow memoir-denouncer", ", book critic for the", ", had already lost the battle before they began to fight. Karr argues that Richard Wright\u2019s", "spearheaded the late-20", "-century memoir boom all the way back in 1945 by offering vital testimony to the lived experiences of people previously deemed insignificant by literary poobahs. Meanwhile, by the 1970s, highbrow novelists apparently felt their form required a major overhaul. A whole school of experimental fiction, mostly written by white men ensconced in universities (John Barth, Robert Coover, Stanley Elkin), stepped forth to offer American readers their wares. \u201cNew forms!\u201d these novelists proclaimed, unveiling, to scattered applause, books that interrogated the artificiality of fiction itself.", "\u201cNew subject matter!\u201d was the rival street call of the memoirists. If the unreality of fiction troubles you, the antidote is not more fiction calling attention to its own unreality, but authenticity, the life stories of people who haven\u2019t had much chance to publish their life stories before. Karr credits Harry Crews\u2019", ", about his \u201ccracker past,\u201d with flushing her out of one of her \u201cbiggest psychological hidey-holes\u201d when she was an \u201cacademically uncredentialed former redneck Texan trying to pass myself off as a poet in hyperliterary Cambridge.\u201d", "But if the memoir\u2019s critics might grudgingly admit the merits of examining important issues like race or class from a different perspective, what really seemed to disgust the naysayers of the \u201990s were memoirs by white women. Karr\u2019s case in point is Kathryn Harrison, who in 1997 published", "a memoir of being seduced by her long-lost father at the age of 20. The book is an unsparing attempt to come to terms with a relationship that had haunted Harrison\u2019s fiction, and for writing it she was, in Karr\u2019s words, \u201cblistered in the press.\u201d", "It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine such a response now, when equally or even more shocking revelations appear on the Internet on a weekly basis. As Bennett pointed out, a very similar story, recently published on", ", went viral, but still garnered nothing in comparison to the uproar that greeted", "Harrison\u2019s was a book people talked about for months and about which every person in the book business felt obliged to take a position. Yardley", "(in one of three pieces pummeling it) as a \u201cslimy, repellent, meretricious, cynical\u201d offering to the \u201cgods of publicity.\u201d Harrison was dunned for not making her memoir sexy enough in", ", while the", "scolded her for transmitting her father\u2019s abuse to her own children by daring to write about it. Notably, her most contemptuous reviewers were men, who were seemingly oblivious to the misogynistic element to their insistence that some life experiences ought to remain unspoken\u2014especially the painful sexual experiences of women.", "The idea of confession, provided the tale finishes up with a triumph over adversity and one\u2019s own weaknesses, has always been a rich vein in American culture. We\u2019re riveted by the drama of a lone individual seeking redemption by standing up in front of a crowd and bearing witness to his or her own troubles. Such testimonials are central to both revivalist Christianity and 12-step programs. First-person narratives of addiction and recovery, like Sarah Hepola\u2019s recent best-seller,", "remain one of the literary memoir\u2019s most reliable manifestations, perhaps because the saga of getting high; hitting bottom; and trekking the long, grueling, switchbacked trail to sobriety can\u2019t really be covered in a 2,000-word piece", "Karr (who wrote her own recovery memoir,", "seems to take it for granted that the aspiring memoirists reading her book want to wrestle with some trauma, though she tries not to encourage self-pity. \u201cLet\u2019s say something pseudo-awful has befallen you\u2014a safe bet for any human unit thinking about a memoir,\u201d she writes. (Can this be true? I\u2019m having a hard time thinking of any that are mainly fond and sunny: Perhaps", "or", ".) It\u2019s clear, at the very least, that the students Karr teaches at Syracuse University have tales of suffering and transcendence they want to tell. (One of the many, many small pleasures of", "is tracking the gentle but firmly dissuading instruction Karr directs at students who come to the task seeking to settle scores with those who have wronged them.) That\u2019s one reason memoir has a complicated relationship to the bastard genre of self-help, another factor contributing to its lowly rep. Some readers understandably doubt the intentions of a trauma memoir. Is it too eager to please its readers, swimming in vapid bromides designed to give sad sacks the delusional comfort they need to carry on with their crappy lives? Or is it literally", "help, written primarily for the author\u2019s sake, to come to terms with some old trouble? Well, what makes you think anyone\u2019s interested in your one-woman therapy sessions?", "The memoir and the self-help tract merge fuzzily in an inspirational travelogue like Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s", "(Gilbert\u2019s forthcoming book,", "throws off all pretense and embraces its pop-psych destiny.) Yet even a more ambitious work, like", "is obliged by the taste of its audience to finish with some life lesson. People don\u2019t want to read your account of unmitigated suffering unless you\u2019re going to hand out a little hope as they file through the exit. Part of the rare, shocking power of Sonali Deraniyagala\u2019s memoir,", "is its refusal of this comfy formula. Even in a memoir by someone who lost her husband, two sons, and both parents in the 2004 tsunami, we\u2019re trained to expect uplift\u2014so when we don\u2019t get that, it\u2019s particularly shattering.", "Readers come to memoirs seeking hope: You survived, so maybe I can too. Karr herself names this as a wellspring of their appeal. But the pressure to provide more reassurance, more excitement, as well as more", "than the truth warrants can lead to falsification. Of course there\u2019s a chapter in", "about lying autobiographers like James Frey, bad actors who have tainted the form\u2019s public image. And yes, of course, memories of events that transpired decades before the memoirist sets pen to paper may be wrong, disputed, or simply missing. Karr vows that neither she nor any of the top-notch memoirists she knows has had to make major revisions in response to complaints from family and friends. \u201cInterviewers and audience members are gobsmacked when I mention this,\u201d she reports. \u201cNo one believes memoirists aren\u2019t constantly assaulted by detractors and naysayers and lawsuits.\u201d", "Sending out a complete draft of the work to the people described in it fends off most such troubles. But a more important preventative step is simply", "Families expect that memories will differ a bit, but \u201cpublishing lies requires a whole different level of sociopathy.\u201d As a reader, Karr insists that a memoirist make her best effort at describing the truth as she experienced it and admit when she\u2019s not sure what really happened or when someone else remembers it differently. David Carr\u2019s memoir,", "an attempt to report out what he did during the worst years of his substance abuse, foregrounds just how challenging squaring that circle can be. Karr has no patience for memoirists like Vivian Gornick, who argue it\u2019s standard procedure to manipulate or invent facts to improve a story without acknowledging they\u2019re doing so upfront. She compares them with a deli guy who announces, \u201cI put just a teaspoon of catshit in your sandwich, but you didn\u2019t notice it at all.\u201d To Karr\u2019s mind, \u201cA small bit of catshit equals a catshit sandwich, unless I know where the catshit is and can eat around it.\u201d", "That quote should give you a pretty good sense of Karr\u2019s voice, if you haven\u2019t gotten around to her memoirs. (And why on earth haven\u2019t you?) The girl got out of southeast Texas, but there\u2019s still plenty of southeast Texas left in the girl. She can also do a Homeric metaphor with the best of \u2019em: \u201cA single image can split open the hard seed of the past, and soon memory pours forth from every direction, sprouting its vines and flowers up around you till the old garden\u2019s taken shape in all its fragrant glory.\u201d Voice, the quality that floods a great memoirist\u2019s most mundane material with radiant charm, is Karr\u2019s superpower. Read her for five pages and suddenly you want to know what she thinks about everything. You want to be her best friend, if she\u2019ll have you.", "Even this rare quality, however, perhaps the greatest advantage of the best memoirists, has been co-opted by other media. We live in an age where it\u2019s possible to be likable for a living. (YouTube stars offer their fans glimpses of their lives, admit adorably to their own foibles, weep out their rough patches, and just generally serve as virtual best friends to millions of lonely viewers.) Except that Karr really is an artist.", "attests to how hard she works at getting her words just right and how deeply she understands the way great writing works. Her close readings of authors ranging from Michael Herr and Hilary Mantel to Crews and Frank Conroy make the book well worth its cover price to aspiring writers and careful readers of all genres. Art is the hardest thing of all to steal, it turns out, because it\u2019s the hardest thing of all to do. Fad followers and lesser lights make up the bulk of any literary trend. The genuine comets are simply too rare, as is (to quote Karr one more time), \u201cthe sheer convincing poetry of a single person trying to make sense of the past.\u201d", "---", "by Mary Karr.
