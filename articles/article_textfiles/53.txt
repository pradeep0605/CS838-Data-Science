Baseball\u2019s canon is vast and varied. And among the figures from the sport\u2019s century-and-a-half history most worthy of all angles of study, few loom larger than Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox left fielder through the 1940s and \u201950s, the last player to post a season\u2019s batting average above .400, a first-ballot Hall of Famer, widely acknowledged as the greatest hitter who ever lived. There are many ways to write about Ted Williams. And longtime", "editor Ben Bradlee, Jr., touches them all with his exhaustive, 850-page tome of a biography,", ".", "It\u2019s very long, this book. Too long, from an immediate-enjoyment standpoint: Some of the 126 pages leading up to Williams\u2019s first major league at-bat bog down in picayune detail, and many of the 300 that chronicle his post-retirement years struggle to earn their keep. But the prose is breezy, the research and reporting are impeccable, and, taking a wider view, the length is easy to forgive. This book very much sets out to be the definitive document of a great, complicated, fascinating person\u2014besides the baseball, Williams was a highly decorated fighter pilot and a world-class fisherman\u2014and ultimately, it succeeds. If it sometimes strains to fit in absolutely everything anyone has ever known about Ted Williams, well, you come to see the value in its doing so. It\u2019s a good book.", "The best of it is the baseball. Hitting, specifically. Brimming with accounts of Williams\u2019s swing\u2014a fluid, balletic motion regularly described as \u201cthe most natural\u201d that various describers had ever seen\u2014the book approaches the act of a hitting a pitched baseball as high art. Six-foot-3 and always spindly for an athlete, the \u201cSplendid Splinter\u201d mastered the mechanics of batting such that he generated torque wholly disproportionate to his muscle mass. Bradlee collects and assembles awestruck anecdotes from friends, teammates, coaches, and journalists about balls hit harder and farther than anybody had ever seen balls hit before. None of them are not fun to read.", "One of the best anecdotes comes from Hall of Famer Eddie Collins, who says the first time he saw Williams hit, \u201cthere was something about the way he tied into that ball which all but shocked me out of my seat. It was as though a shock of electricity had just passed through my body. In that fleeting moment, as he swung at the ball, I became convinced that here was one of the most natural hitters in the history of baseball. I\u2019d have staked my life on it.\u201d", "Williams never liked the term: \u201cNatural hitter my ass,\u201d he said. He\u2019d worked and studied, practiced countless hours, days, perfecting his swing. He was obsessed. The same way a million other American boys have been obsessed over the years, of course. But Williams\u2019 drive, Bradlee argues, was intensified by the escape baseball provided from a neglected, impoverished childhood in southern California.", "\u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t sleeping or eating,\u201d he quotes Williams saying of his growing up, \u201cI was practicing swinging. If I didn\u2019t have a bat, I\u2019d take any piece of wood, or make a bat of paper and swing it.\u201d \u201cOr,\u201d Bradlee continues, for him, \u201che\u2019d just swing an imaginary bat. If he passed a storefront that had a big, clear window, he liked to stop, take a few swings, and check his reflection out. When he did this, he\u2019d be in his own world, oblivious to the merchants inside bemused by the vainglorious displays. The truth is, Ted didn\u2019t want to just be", ". He wanted to", "good.\u201d (", ".)", "Once Williams makes the majors\u2014he joined the Red Sox for his rookie season in 1939\u2014and Bradlee has national newspaper stories to draw from, the book really starts to sing. \u201cIn his third game, Ted had a double and single, but it was his fourth game, on Sunday, April 23, that served as his true Fenway Park coming out party,\u201d Bradlee writes. \u201cIn his second time up against Philadelphia\u2019s LeRoy \u2018Tarzan\u2019 Parmelee, Ted scorched a ball into the right-center-field bleachers, just to the right of the outfield triangle, about 430 feet away, for his first home run.

A slump at the start of his second season turned things sour, however, and an antagonistic relationship with fans and journalists alike became a dark theme of his career. Not that it hindered his production. He was an angry person, extremely self-critical and, at times, mean to others. It seemed to fuel his excellence.", "He had a flair for the dramatic, and his heroics play out thrillingly on the page. The home run he hit to win the 1941 All-Star Game. The six hits he collected the last day of that season, after choosing to play in a doubleheader in Philadelphia, rather than sit out to preserve his (last ever) .400 average. The home run he hit on Sept. 28, 1960, in the last at-bat of his career. (That one immortalized, three weeks later, in John Updike\u2019s classic", "essay, \u201c", ".\u201d) Bradlee relays such moments well. \u201cThe crowd screamed anew,\u201d he writes of Williams\u2019 exit off the field in the last inning of his last game, \u201cbut Ted ran right through the cheers, still unwilling to bow to convention. As he passed shortstop, he said to Pumpsie Green, \u2018Isn\u2019t this a crock of shit?\u2019 Green laughed.\u201d And the context Bradlee provides\u2014the heavy detailing, the quotes and anecdotes\u2014brings the reader inside Williams\u2019 psychology, to the extent that that\u2019s possible.", "Sure, you might scratch your head on Page 34, when you learn that Williams\u2019 paternal aunt Alice had a dog, part coyote, named Cap, that her friend Roselle Romano thought \u201cwas a nasty thing,\u201d wondering why you\u2019ve learned this\u2014especially as it becomes apparent that you will be learning little else about Alice or Cap or Roselle, or many of the other myriad members of the extended family who get a quick sketch early on. And you might have trouble keeping straight which horrible thing Williams said to which of the three wives he divorced before he settled down with Louise Kaufman, with whom he lived for 24 years and to whom he also said some horrible things. But by the time you get to the sad, disturbing end of the story, where you learn lots of sad, disturbing things about Williams\u2019 children, and the legal fight that broke out around his will, and a \u201ccryonics\u201d company called Alcor that freezes human corpses in giant thermoses called \u201cDewars\u201d in the hopes of unfreezing them in the future, once medical science has advanced to a point where it can bring them back to life, and you read the unpleasant and difficult-to-believe sentence, \u201cWith these fundamental issues resolved, Darwin picked up a carving knife and began to slice off Williams\u2019s head,\u201d you\u2019re happy for everything you\u2019ve learned in this giant book.
