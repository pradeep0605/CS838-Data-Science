{"Body": ["Photo by yourmj3sty/Thinkstock", "may be the most provocative title in a long list of provocative book titles from essayist Laura Kipnis\u2014a remarkable feat for a woman whose previous works include", "and", ". \u00a0With boldness like that, it\u2019s no surprise that the headline somewhat wryly overpromises. Kipnis doesn\u2019t produce a grand theory of men, which is as it should be, since there\u2019s little you can say definitively about a diverse group of more than 3.5 billion individuals.", "Amanda Marcotte is writer for", ".", "", "But while it\u2019s hard to come to a meaningful conclusion about men, the collective, there is a lot to be said about the idea of", ", a tyrannical concept that the whole group must grapple with, whether they like it or not. In this collection of essays, which explores the individual lives and experiences of various male case studies, a theme emerges: men trying to define themselves against the nebulous dictates of their gender, and all the expectations and privileges it implies.", "Kipnis, with her keen eye for human failings, delights in the way this lifelong struggle adds an air of ridiculousness to the whole enterprise of manhood. Masculinity is an idealized state, so of course men are in a permanent state of failing at it, and yet they seem unable to quit. \u201cSomething about the poetics of masculine panic, old school and new, just draws me in,\u201d Kipnis writes.", "Kipnis\u2019 willingness to forgive men their foibles and coddle their insecurities doesn\u2019t extend to the women she writes about.", "Not that she is unsympathetic to the male specimens brought under her microscope. If anything, Kipnis seems to like men a little bit more when their fantasies of virile power are failed by their human imperfections. She\u2019s particularly drawn to analyzing instances in which a man\u2019s desperation for female adoration causes him to act like an idiot, from Anthony Weiner tweeting out dick pics to John Edwards spiking his family and political career in order to carry on an affair with a featherheaded New Age\u2013y type. One essay makes sharp, compassionate observations about the male anxiety and vulnerability splashed all over the world of porn. \u201cThe magazine is saturated with frustrated desire and uncertainty: sex is an arena for potential failure, not domination,\u201d Kipnis notes, observing the explosion of ads for penis extenders and erection aids in", "\u2019s pages.", "Yet Kipnis\u2019 willingness to forgive men their foibles and coddle their insecurities doesn\u2019t extend to the women she writes about. The author spends a lot of time stomping around in \u201990s-style critiques of feminism that suggest that women, a group also encompassing more than 3.5 billion diverse individuals, would be better off growing a thicker skin than having institutions like universities embrace stricter sexual harassment policies.", "Kipnis\u2019 tendency to empathize with male vulnerability while shaming female vulnerability results in the weakest entry in the series, a piece denouncing Naomi Wolf for her essay describing how Harold Bloom hit on her when she was one of his students. Kipnis is full of pity for Bloom, imagining the \u201ctransfixing\u201d power Wolf\u2019s \u201cyouth and prettiness\u201d held for \u201cthe aging ugly man.\u201d But she spares little sympathy for the student whose writerly ambitions were painfully undercut by her mentor\u2019s lascivious wants; it\u2019s startling to watch Kipnis worry so much about the hurt feelings of a wealthy and powerful college professor and so little about a young woman shaken badly enough by the whole incident to vomit from the nerves.", "Photo by Pieter M. van Hattem", "Kipnis has far too many of these \u201cchill girl\u201d moments, where she props herself up by suggesting she\u2019s unperturbed by the typical things that send hands clutching pearl-ward. \u201cCritics are supposed to have deeply felt moral outrage on things,\u201d she humble brags, but \u201cit\u2019s like I\u2019m shooting outrage blanks.\u201d In her recent interview", "she sounds a similar note, decrying the \u201cPuritan leanings\u201d and \u201cgood girl complex that has infected American feminism.\u201d", "Perhaps this is why she closes the book with a critical assessment of Andrea Dworkin, an \u201980s-era anti-porn feminist who died nine years ago and whose writings are mostly kept alive by those who need a hyperbolic man hater to quote. It\u2019s a fine essay. I enjoyed it in the same spirit as I enjoy reading about obscure punk bands that only record collectors care about anymore. But Kipnis either doesn\u2019t realize or doesn\u2019t care that the ghost of Dworkin long ago fled the feminist headquarters, leaving only a memorial straw woman behind.", "When she sets aside the need to be seen as too cool, however, Kipnis is a powerhouse of insights about how feminism has dramatically escalated the already existing anxiety men experience. Feeling like a virile man was much easier back in the day, but now, as Kipnis writes, \u201cthere\u2019s less reason than ever to pretend to admire\u201d men.", "I know how the chimps felt when Jane Goodall started scribbling in her notebooks.", "", "-lubber2", "", "", "", "Repeatedly, she zeroes in on how keenly men are rankled by their revoked entitlement to female flattery, and it\u2019s always hilarious. Christopher Hitchens\u2019 fantasy that men and not women evolved humor for reproductive purposes, she writes, has \u201cthe slightly musty air of the 1960-ish Kingsley Amis, wrapped in nostalgia for the merry days when sexual conquest required an arsenal of tactics deployed by bon-vivantish cads on girdled, girlish sexual holdouts.\u201d And in a particularly hilarious piece looking at right-wing male reactions to Hillary Clinton, she muses, \u201cYou\u2019d think they were talking about their first wives.\u201d", "Kipnis paints all this male anxiety in the face of women\u2019s growing power as both humorous and poignant. Thankfully though, despite the residual chill girl tendencies, she never suggests that women should abandon feminism to calm men down. It\u2019s 2014, for one thing, and for another, their panic is just too fun to watch.", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
