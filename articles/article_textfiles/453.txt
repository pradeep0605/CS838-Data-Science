Science fiction treats constantly with time anxiety: Speed someone up and the world slows down. Send astronauts to space and they barely age as decades pass on the planet they left behind, as in Ursula K. LeGuin\u2019s heartbreaking early novella", ", which also features flying giant cats. Or take the film", ", which articulated a profound modern fear: That no matter what we do, no matter how hard we fight it, we are each of us doomed to become Bruce Willis.", "Paul Ford is a writer who lives in New York City. He is the sole proprietor of", ".", "And then there\u2019s plain old everyday psychological time, the real, non-science-fictional stuff passing us by, which we perceive via the throbbing gearwork in our brains. The psychology of that kind of time\u2014not the physics or philosophy of it\u2014is the subject of British science journalist Claudia Hammond\u2019s lively book", ".", "It\u2019s a book about mental apparatus. How do we know a moment has passed? Hammond\u2019s best bet is that we use the brain\u2019s dopamine system along with a few other brain components. \u201cWe are creating our own perception of time,\u201d she writes, \u201cbased on the neuronal activity in our brains with input from the physiological symptoms of our bodies.\u201d The answer is not in our stars but in \u201cthe cerebellum, the basal ganglia, the frontal lobe and the anterior insular cortex.\u201d", "Ever since Oliver Sacks, pop psychology has trafficked in damaged brains, and in exploring the ways that science understands our perception of time Hammond makes the first half of her book into a catalog of head trauma. There is the man with the injury to the right frontal lobe who lost his ability to accurately estimate the passage of time, the folks in vegetative states who don\u2019t blink in anticipation of an air-puffer (and thus have lost all sense of the future), the people who suffer brain damage and can\u2019t differentiate between decades, and poor Henry Molaison, who, as treatment for his seizures, had a silver straw inserted into his brain and his hippocampus partially sucked out, and consequently, until he died 45 years later in 2008, never made any new memories, living forever in the past. Henry\u2019s story was much like that of another man who slipped off his motorcycle and thus can\u2019t think of the future.", "Hammond is good company, that is, but this is a not-unpadded book. There is some blatant narrative foolery that hardly suits the story. The tale of a BASE jumper awkwardly named Chuck Berry is cut off,", "\u2013style, literally in midair. \u201cNow,\u201d writes Hammond, \u201cI'm sure you're wondering what happened to Chuck Berry, our base-jumping glider pilot who was left suspended in the air, his body falling and time dilating. I'm afraid you won't find out right away, as there are many other issues to explore.\u201d Are there?", "Anyway, Berry survives, the better to explain his perceptions; as he hurtled to earth time appeared to slow down and he made sensible decisions that saved his life. It\u2019s not so much that we speed up in a crisis, exactly, as that the internal human clock that tracks time is variable. Hammond on ganglia is more fun than Hammond pacing out a skydiving story; neither the book or its readers are well-served by the imperatives of modern science writing (\u201cWe need", "to make this", "stuff", "to", "!\u201d), the relentless adherence to form (", "). Time is such an urgent subject, so local to our thoughts, that it needs very little narrative easing. The looming specter of death sells this book just fine.", "Once Hammond puts down the skull saw (around Chapter 4) things pick up, and she digs into big, ambiguous questions. A chapter on \u201cWhy time speeds up as you get older\u201d is the good stuff. She starts with conventional wisdom, i.e. \u201cA year feels faster at the age of 40 because it's only one fortieth of your life, whereas at the age of eight a year forms a far more significant proportion.\u201d Too simple, she says; as William James once wrote, \u201cthe days, the months, and the years [seem shorter]; whether the hours do so is doubtful, and the minutes and seconds to all appearance remain about the same.\u201d It turns out that we form a \u201cpreponderance of memories\u201d of life between age 15 and age 25: \u201cfirst sexual relationships, first jobs, first travel without parents, first experience of living away from home.\u201d This psychological phenomenon has a wonderful name: the Reminiscence Bump.", "\u201cWe even remember more scenes from the films we saw and the books we read in our late teens and early twenties,\u201d writes Hammond. One of the reasons time seems to speed up is that we actually have more memories of our youth. Which could explain why every generation freaks out over the one that follows: We\u2019ve already made our memories, and to see these", "little memory-factories with their own music, their own films, their own ideas when our own ideas still", "so fresh and fertile\u2014their youth is an insult and it will not stand.", "Courtesy of Ian Skelton", "I remember feeling particularly old one day when I read a YouTube comment on a Kesha video. It said something like, in typically unpunctuated Tubese:", "You\u2019re only as old as the music you hate. Or consider the recent manufactured fuss over millennials (they\u2019re lazy! they won\u2019t pay attention! but maybe they\u2019re great!) perpetrated by", "magazine. Just watch", "to see what happens when one type of reminiscence bumps into another. Or read", "Ugly bumpings indeed.", "As Hammond points out, many people see time spatially, going from left to right\u2014unless they speak Hebrew or Arabic, which are right-to-left languages. For those people time moves in the opposite direction. And as for speakers of Mandarin, traditionally written top-to-bottom (even though it\u2019s increasingly left-to-right on computer screens)? They are eight times more likely than English speakers to \u201clay time out vertically, usually pointing up into the air for earlier events and down for later ones.\u201d Also, we think about time in terms of space, but not the other way around; no one says, Hammond points out, that a street is four minutes long.", "Extrapolating just a bit, perhaps humans \u201csee\u201d time as a space, see their youths as a place. And when a new generation crops up it threatens the territory of the old one, they move in and colonize that zone of human life known as youth. Begone, Pixies, and make way for Imagine Dragons.", "Not that Hammond would speculate like this; she sticks with the science. She isn\u2019t afraid of a little ambiguity, though. The human understanding of time is hardly a solved problem; the Reminiscence Bump, while a real phenomenon, does not fully explain why time seems to speed up as you age. (You need to factor in also that we are making fewer memories every year\u2014the Holiday Paradox, referring to how holidays seem to fly by but loom large in our memories.) Her agent is probably annoyed Hammond didn\u2019t write", ", but it\u2019s nice to read a science book that isn\u2019t buttoned up.", "A well-researched meditation on how we see the future is the meat of the book; the real purpose of our memories, Hammond points out, may be to help us anticipate the future. Memories serve as our guides to decision-making; more so, the sorts of choices\u2014and thus memories\u2014we make classify us into human categories, whether we", ".", "We know you can\u2019t trust memories, which means, says Hammond, that you can\u2019t trust your predictions of the future. On our way to a picnic we anticipate the picnic, not the traffic. On our way to the doctor we don\u2019t imagine drinking a cold glass of water in a calm waiting room but rather being probed and questioned. \u201cWe expect the best of good events,\u201d she writes, \u201cand the worst of the bad. We imagine that if something grave happens to us, we won't be able to cope, and that if something positive happens it will make us so happy that our lives will be transformed. But in both cases we will still be the same people we are now.\u201d", "Which is also why we all suck at scheduling; we set our deadlines months out never expecting to be as busy then as we are today. Everyone believes that they will somehow be better, less burdened, and more free in the future. But \u201cforever yearning for that calm future where everything is perfectly organized sets you up for disappointment.\u201d Which is a comfort of a sort. Because the great question of time is not, of course, \u201cWhy do I remember so many songs from 1989?\u201d or \u201cWill Chuck Berry survive his BASE-jumping excursion?\u201d or even \u201cCan dogs remember individual events?\u201d (They can\u2019t, which also means they probably don\u2019t feel regret, which sounds great to me.) There\u2019s one great question of time, one which of course this book cannot answer, but on which it gives a great deal of much-needed perspective: \u201cHow much do I have left?\u201d", "---", "by Claudia Hammond.
