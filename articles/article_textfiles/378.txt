{"Body": ["Illustration by Nick Pitarra", "Early in Rosecrans Baldwin\u2019s droll and well-observed memoir", ", Baldwin\u2019s looking for an apartment in the Latin Quarter, and in the shadow of the Pantheon, he reflects on all that has happened since the days of Hemingway. He goes on to list some of these things: \u201cLuke Skywalker had happened. Supermarkets happened. Hip-hop happened and Joan Didion happened. Email happened.\u201d", "", "", ". The Paris of today is no longer your parents\u2019 Paris,", "Paris\u2014the city of Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and later Julia Child, of 20-franc hotel rooms and 5-franc bistro lunches. Paris has grown up, learned English, globalized, and gotten expensive. Meanwhile in America: Espresso has happened, Chez Panisse has happened, Napa Valley has happened. In both places, 1968 happened. Paris has sushi restaurants and immigration issues, and America has Whole Foods, which evokes such reverence in the French people in Baldwin\u2019s book that they call it \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201cso beautiful\u201d and declare\u2014crazily, to American ears\u2014that \u201cwe have nothing like Whole Foods ... show me where in Paris food is sold like art.\u201d", "", "So who is talking to whom here? Has America become more French, has France become more American? Baldwin, like many Americans, harbors fantasies about life in Paris\u2014there he would discover his true artistic self, shed the banal skin of Americanness, and rediscover himself as a European. Perhaps he would learn to appreciate wine. He moves to Paris in 2007 to take a job as a copywriter for a big French advertising firm. He and his wife rent an apartment in the Marais, and when Baldwin isn\u2019t writing copy, he\u2019s studiously working on a novel, in another grand tradition of American writers.", "", "It\u2019s a little ballsy at this point to write an American-in-Paris memoir, given the genre\u2019s deep bench. Since moving to Paris 18 months ago, I\u2019ve read", ",", ",", ",", ", and\u2014most recently, after having a baby here myself\u2014", ". Every publishing season seems to bring its own Paris memoir, and every season I (and plenty of other Americans, in Paris or America,) snap these stories up. But what makes Baldwin\u2019s book particularly enjoyable is that it engages with the clash of our American idea of Paris and Paris the modern reality. In Paris the global city, Baldwin continually runs up against his provincial and romantic fantasies, and then asks himself why he has them in the first place.", "", "In many ways, Baldwin and I are in the same cohort: thirtysomething, college-educated, upper-middle-class Americans with jobs in media. We both moved to Paris from New York City with our spouses. Both of us first learned to revere Paris from our parents. Baldwin remembers visiting the city as a child and watching his mother transform into a woman over a bowl of caf\u00e9 au lait. Similarly, I\u2019m named after \u00c9ric Rohmer\u2019s film", ", and my parents fed me escargot before I turned 10. Both of us were raised on the Paris of our parents\u2019 expectations, a place where everything was a little more beautiful, more cultured, more intellectual, more delicious, more right.", "", "Against this shimmering ideal, modern Paris can be a bit of a slap in the face, sometimes feeling designed to sabotage all romance. The quaint bistro down the street from Baldwin is run by Australians, serves ostrich steak, and is wallpapered in pornographic cartoons. The Metro is crowded, the coffee is terrible, and it rains as much as in London. The most delicious and affordable food comes from the local frozen food retailer, Picard.", "", "It may seem naive or even insane to cling to a romanticized image of a city when its full-blooded reality is staring you in the face. But Paris encourages such paradox because of how heavily it trades on its own romantic mythology. More international tourists", "than any other city, and Paris knows what they come for: not just the Eiffel tower key chains but\u00a0the quaint bistros, the sidewalk cafes, the Louvre, the croissants and the baguettes and the boules. Though a lot has happened since Hemingway, it\u2019s still selling that story.", "Susie Post Rust", "And it quickly becomes Baldwin\u2019s job to sell it as well, because at his ad-agency job he writes copy for Louis Vuitton and other French brands. As one executive at a French brandy concern puts it, the agency\u2019s chief dilemma is to \u201creconvince the world to love France\u201d (p.196)\u2014\u00a0specifically, France the unquestioned authority on luxury, not only to Americans but to a larger world market, most notably China. Chinese nouveau riche are buying French liquor as a prestige brand, drinking cognac with their meals like wine. Despite gasps and exclamations of \u201cBut that\u2019s not normal!\u201d from the French people in the room, a market is a market, and if it\u2019s the Chinese who now have the money to support the French luxury industry, then it\u2019s China that France will market Frenchness to.", "The most well-observed passages in", "come from Baldwin\u2019s time in this very French office, where his colleagues eat their McDonald\u2019s lunches in courses (McNuggets, then fries and a burger, then salad, then dessert), and he can never figure out", "on both cheeks. Here, cultural assumptions break both ways\u2014while Baldwin seems fascinated by the sad, confident sexiness of most Parisian men, he\u2019s also an object of fascination to many of his co-workers, who are dying to move to New York. One of the Web designers starts calling him \u201cmy nigger\u201d until Baldwin tells him it cannot continue, and another takes him to lunch to furtively confess, in a Paris filled with indignant union workers constantly on strike, her secret capitalist leanings.", "When Baldwin seeks his own idea of Paris, rather than focusing on that of his parents or on selling it to Chinese businessmen, he\u2014and we\u2014are often disappointed. Though he takes pains to explain that his neighborhood in the Haut Marais wasn\u2019t", "hip in 2007, it\u2019s still essentially Paris\u2019 West Village, a picturesque quarter that feels like a small town, but where your neighbor just happens to be a millionaire film star. It\u2019s where the cool globetrotting kids hang out, where you may hear more English spoken than French. The other expats he meets seem uniformly obnoxious, particularly those connected with", ", an invitation-only networking group that goes global with the cliquishness of high school. His descriptions of Small World parties\u2014populated with trust-funders who exclaim \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u00a0even know a Parisian, isn\u2019t that appalling?\u201d\u2014made my teeth ache. Eventually he drops this group, tired of their rarefied bubble, but not before I\u2019d heard way too much from them.", "", "Baldwin is more interesting when he\u2019s being a plain old immigrant and attending his", "(Civic Day), a course in French history and government required of all foreigners living in France. He\u2019s the only American in a class populated by residents of former French colonies like Algeria and Senegal, and his fellow students fully grasp the irony of their former colonizer now instructing them on equality. In a lesson on laws about assault, the teacher asks the class if it\u2019s legal for him to hit them; a young Tunisian replies, \u201cI\u2019m an Arab, so you probably can hit me. Maybe it depends", "you hit me.\u201d This Paris isn\u2019t just a romantic luxurious dream, but part of a powerful country in its own right, with deep-seated problems of race and class that are different from our own.", "Americans aren\u2019t the only ones who go through profound Paris disillusionment; as Baldwin mentions in his book, there\u2019s a psychological phenomenon called Paris Syndrome which strikes Japanese tourists when the reality of Paris doesn\u2019t live up to the fantasy. As many as a dozen", "when their disillusionment brings about nervous collapse. Even Parisians are sometimes happier thinking about Paris than living in it; one confesses to Baldwin, \u201cI would not want to live here if I could choose a different history.\u201d This sentiment is echoed by many of his coworkers, who feel trapped: Paris is far too expensive/crowded/elitist to live in, but it\u2019s Paris\u2014how could you leave?", "Gradually, Baldwin\u2019s fantasy Paris is replaced by reality, and he finds he loves that city, too. As in falling in love with a person, true love with a city only comes in accepting its faults, and for those of us who tough it out, the irritants of Paris can become badges of honor, and small triumphs. (In that way, it\u2019s not unlike New York, the city celebrated and excoriated in the", "from which Baldwin pinches his title.) Baldwin finally knows he\u2019s fluent in French when he can get the telemarketer from his mobile-phone company to stop calling him every day. I knew I\u2019d make it here the day that, cut off by a monstrous Parisian scooter, I cursed in French. (Seriously, why drive a three-wheeled scooter with a windshield? Just buy a car already.)", "There\u2019s a weird kind of joy in figuring out how to get past, around, or through the bureaucracy, the paperwork, the endless dossiers and", "s that make up life here as either immigrant or native son. It may not be the Paris of Miller or Hemingway, but it\u2019s our Paris\u2014where they review novels on the evening news, and where you can still buy a great bottle of wine for 10 euros and drink it on the banks of the Seine.", "?", ".", "", "", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
