To me, the grid plan is Puritan, it\u2019s homogenizing, in a city where there is no homogenization available\u2014there is only total existence, total cacophony, a total flowing of human ethnicities and tribes and beings and gradations of awareness and consciousness and cruising.\u201d", "That last being basically Levitch\u2019s term for both touring and good vibes, generally.

His implication was a correct one: The grid is indeed a self-portrait.", "Randel, who was born in Albany in 1787, grew up during \u201ca surveying boom,\u201d when a large portion of prominent American males\u2014Washington, Jefferson, Adams, and later, Lincoln\u2014served in the profession at some point. \u201cHis was the era of laying lines on the land,\u201d Holloway declares. It was \u201ca culture and a period in which reason and measured action were prized and dominion over the natural world\u2014through exploration, experiment, science, cartography, and infrastructure\u2014was celebrated.\u201d Beginning in about 1804, Randel was hired to assist New York State surveyor-general Simeon Dewitt in his plan to grid upstate New York.

He worked nearly every day of the dozen or so years he spent creating and then instituting the grid plan\u2014\u201cwith increasing precision and obsession,\u201d Holloway writes. He refused to survey or write on the Sunday Sabbath, and once resorted to paying an especially disorderly employee not to drink. He invented his own instruments when he found existing ones insufficient for the task, and had tantrums over surveying mistakes of piddling importance. Repeatedly set back by winter, wind, and rain; slowed by robbery and broken instruments; arrested and sued for cutting down trees; and once assaulted by an old woman wielding cabbages and artichokes after drawing a street through her kitchen\u2014the surveyor\u2019s main obstacle was his own finicky perfectionism. \u201cIrregularities unsettled Randel,\u201d as Holloway understatedly puts it.", "Planning for the development of New York City beyond its northern border\u2014then at Houston Street, called North Street, though pre-existing Greenwich Village was exempt\u2014was regularly presented in Manichean terms of intellect against emotion, order against chaos. \u201cWe have suffered so much from pestilence,\u201d a group of New Yorkers wrote to the mayor and Common Council just after Randel submitted his plan, \u201cWe have so severely felt the evil of confused Streets.\u201d The plan\u2019s geometric egalitarianism appealed to the young country\u2019s democratic spirit, and, as Holloway persuasively argues, helped to \u201ctransform space into an expression of public philosophy.\u201d", "But once the Enlightenment started giving way to more Romantic notions of reason, order, solitude, space, and beauty, the grid became less popular. Frederick Law Olmsted, for instance, wrote that curved streets \u201cimply leisure, contemplativeness, and happy tranquility,\u201d while straight streets connote \u201ceagerness to press forward, without looking to the right or left.\u201d Olmsted designed Central Park, according to Garrett Dash Nelson, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, as an \u201c", "\u201d space that would give New Yorkers a break from the otherwise unrelenting monotony Olmsted once called \u201cthe epitome of the evil of commercialism.\u201d That urban-planning Romanticism, upgraded and cult-studded, is now one component of \u201ccritical geography,\u201d which seeks to examine how the world of ideas and power relations manifests itself on physical landscapes.", "Postmodernism, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily entail contempt for the grid.

Toward the end of his life, as he suffered many professional setbacks and legal difficulties, Randel became litigious and rather unhinged. It is initially startling to see Randel described in his later years as \u201cerratic and peculiar\u201d while before he had been \u201cprecise and exacting.\u201d Then one realizes that note was there all along. Examining the instruments Randel invented, one expert whom Holloway quotes wondered whether Randel carried his Enlightenment rationality \u201cto an excess, to where it became counterproductive \u2026 to where logic did not dictate his decisions.\u201d The same is evident in his grid.
