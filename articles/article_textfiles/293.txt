{"Body": ["Laurence Jackson Hyman", "As recently as six years ago, when the Library of America released a collection of Shirley Jackson\u2019s writings, her legacy was uncertain. \u201cShirley Jackson?\u201d", ". \u201cA writer mostly famous for one short story, \u2018The Lottery.\u2019 Is LOA about to jump the shark?\u201d True, no one who\u2019s read", "is ever going to forget it. The story created such a sensation when it appeared in the", "in 1948 that the magazine issued a press release saying", "than to any work of fiction it had ever published. But Jackson also wrote many other indelible short stories, as well as two great short novels, one of which,", ", was nominated for a National Book Award in 1960.", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "lost to Philip Roth\u2019s", ", a fact that pretty much encapsulates Jackson\u2019s professional plight. She wrote spare, idiosyncratic, unsettling fiction, tinged with a hectic misanthropy, about misfits, oddballs, and the chronically overlooked. Her main characters were almost always women, many of them on the threshold of coming unhinged. Her literary mode was the gothic and her great theme was the terror and allure of domesticity. As darkly uncommercial as this might sound, her books\u2014particularly her last completed novel,", "\u2014got good reviews and even became best-sellers. But no one thought of them as \u201cgreat,\u201d because she published during an era when American culture could only conceive of a particular kind of novel, the kind that Roth (and Saul Bellow and Norman Mailer and John Updike) wrote, as \u201cgreat.\u201d When women appeared in those novels, it was mostly to be resented for their refusal to fulfill the role of uncomplicated suppliers of nurturance and sex.", "But Jackson, unlike so many once-popular novelists, did not subside into obscurity. A small, steady following for her work persisted over the next five decades, keeping her books in print and awaiting favorable conditions for a revival. A new biography,", "by the critic Ruth Franklin, represents the latest and most concerted attempt to reclaim the writer\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s also a fresh effort to frame her as an artist with extraordinary insight into the lives, the concerns, and\u2014above all\u2014the fears of women. Franklin doesn\u2019t attempt to portray Jackson as a feminist. The F-word seldom appears in Shirley Jackson, although Franklin makes frequent reference to Betty Friedan\u2019s", ", a book that does capture some of the confusion and dissatisfaction of Jackson\u2019s life and work. The iconography of 20", "-century literary feminism rests uneasily on Jackson\u2019s shoulders. She was tragic, but obscurely so. Unlike Sylvia Plath, she wasn\u2019t tormented to her doom (or not exactly) by a dastardly husband, and unlike both Plath and Joan Didion, Jackson\u2014plain, overweight, wearing a shapeless housedress when she even went out at all\u2014made a cosmetically unappealing role model for the sort of young literary women who, being young, care about appearances more than they like to let on.", "Besides, no one could ever quite get a bead on Shirley Jackson. She was, as Franklin writes, \u201can important writer who happened to be\u2014and to embrace being\u2014a housewife, as women of her generation were all but required to do.\u201d (Jackson was born in 1916.) She wrote disturbing fiction that gave some of her readers nightmares, and she also wrote", "about raising the four children she had with her husband, the literary critic Stanley Edgar Hyman. (Franklin writes that Jackson \u201cessentially invented the form that has become the modern-day \u2018mommy blog.\u2019 \u201d) Far from discouraging her, Hyman considered Jackson a genius and berated her for not spending more of her time writing\u2014although granted, this was partly because they always needed the money. For much of their marriage, she outearned him.", "Jackson\u2019s contemporaries found the contrast between her fiction and nonfiction\u2014the eerie and the cheery\u2014baffling. Just as perplexing to the present-day devotee of her stories and novels is the marked contrast between Jackson\u2019s life at the center of a boisterous bohemian family and the fragile, isolated characters she invented. The daughter of a highly conventional California socialite who never ceased to voice her disappointment in her daughter, Jackson rebelled comprehensively: by marrying a Jew, by taking few pains with her grooming, by keeping a messy house, by telling the world all about it. Yet she was never able to shake her mother\u2019s influence, dutifully writing to her parents and submitting her life for their disapproval throughout her entire adulthood. One of the most poignant documents in Franklin\u2019s book is a letter Jackson wrote to her mother after she received glowing coverage for", "in", ", only to have her mother focus entirely on the unflattering photograph the magazine used. \u201cSurely at my age,\u201d Jackson retorted, \u201cI have a right to live as I please, and I have just had enough of the unending comments on my appearance and faults.\u201d She never mustered the nerve to send it.", "Jackson, at the peak of her powers, was about to embark on a new phase of her career and perhaps her life.", "Jackson met Hyman when they were both students at Syracuse University; he announced he would marry her, sight unseen, after reading a story she published in a campus journal. The young couple scraped by in Greenwich Village for a few years, then Hyman got a job as a staff writer for the", ". He remained on a retainer at the magazine for the rest of his life, but in the 1950s the family moved to Vermont, where Hyman joined the faculty of the progressive women\u2019s college Bennington College. A charismatic talker and dedicated mentor, Hyman taught what was for many years the university\u2019s most popular course \u201cMyth, Ritual, and Literature.\u201d He was Jackson\u2019s first reader (the pair edited each other\u2019s work) and a top-notch literary champion. One of the couple\u2019s closest friends, the novelist Ralph Ellison, wrote much of his own masterpiece,", ", in the Hymans\u2019 rambling old Vermont house, Hyman\u2019s relentless encouragement spurring the often-blocked Ellison on. Jackson was a gifted, adventurous cook. They threw famous parties, whose guests included such luminaries as Dylan Thomas, the poet Howard Nemerov, and Bernard Malamud.", "But Hyman was also chronically unfaithful to Jackson, flatly refusing to make even a pretense of monogamy, no matter how much misery this caused his wife. And his criticism often tormented Jackson, much as her mother\u2019s did, a bitter irony when she\u2019d picked him, in part, for the ways he seemed her parents\u2019 opposite. When, in the years leading up to her sudden death by heart attack in 1965, Jackson seriously contemplated leaving her marriage, she accused Hyman of subjecting her to \u201cmockery.\u201d Franklin does not establish the themes of his criticism, beyond her haphazard writing regimen and the disorder of her work area, but this was apparently a big problem. One of Franklin\u2019s discoveries is the correspondence with a fan, a fellow housewife in Baltimore, that Jackson kept up in the early 1960s (while she was writing", "). A cache of Jackson\u2019s letters turned up in the woman\u2019s attic after her death in 2013. In one, Jackson reported that Hyman refused even to enter her office because her bookshelves weren\u2019t alphabetized.", "Alan Chin", "The novel Jackson was working on when she died,", ", is narrated by a middle-age woman whose husband has just died under unclear circumstances. She sells everything they owned and moves to another city under a new name, Angela Motorman. (Jackson, Franklin observes, considered driving the epitome of freedom.) She hangs out a shingle as medium, which provides that whiff of the occult that had long been associated with Jackson\u2019s fiction\u2014but her jaunty, enterprising self-confidence sets her apart from all of Jackson\u2019s other heroines. Franklin believes that Jackson, at the peak of her powers, was about to embark on a new phase of her career and perhaps her life. In her final diary, she wrote of her longing \u201cto be separate, to be alone, to stand and walk alone, not to be different and weak and helpless and degraded \u2026 and shut out. Not shut out, shutting out.\u201d", "This does sound very much like the cry of a later generation of feminists, women who left stifling conventional marriages to find themselves. Franklin writes that Jackson\u2019s \u201cpreoccupation with the roles that women play at home and the forces that conspire to keep them there was entirely of a piece with her cultural moment, the decade of the 1950s, when the simmering brew of women\u2019s dissatisfaction finally came close to boiling over, triggering the second wave to the feminist movement.\u201d But Jackson both does and doesn\u2019t fit this mold. Far from interfering with her creative work, her family actually depended on it. And Jackson genuinely enjoyed running a household and raising her children. It\u2019s conceivable that, if she had lived to see the rise of second-wave feminism, she would have found it uncongenial or irrelevant.", "And yet, Jackson\u2019s unhappiness was tied to her gender. Hers are novels of identity, like", ", a work that shares many of the same undercurrents. Both Jackson and Ellison wrote about wrestling with roles imposed not just by a white male-dominated society, but also by people who share one\u2019s assigned identity. In Jackson\u2019s stories and novels, other women are always the strictest enforcers of correct feminine behavior, a phenomenon she experienced firsthand from childhood. In an early draft of", ", quoted in Shirley Jackson, a character remarks, when her sister urges her to get married, \u201cPerhaps she found the married state so excruciatingly disagreeable herself that it was the only thing bad enough she could think of to do to me.\u201d To belong requires miserable compliance; if you refuse, you will be \u201cshut out,\u201d and miserable in a different way.", "The tension infusing this unbearable choice fills Jackson\u2019s fiction with doubles and imposters, selves distributed among multiple characters, and in the novel", ", a heroine with multiple personalities. The uncanniness in her novels and stories derives from a sensation that people who feel unfree to be themselves are haunted by the selves that cannot be. (Henry James, a profound influence on Jackson\u2019s scenarios, although certainly not on her prose, once wrote a story in which the narrator is pursued by the ghost of the man he would have been had he lived his life differently.) The vertiginous, diffuse terror Jackson so excelled at inspiring comes from the sense that her characters don\u2019t even really know who they are. This is distinct from Franklin\u2019s understanding of the occult in Jackson\u2019s work as \u201ca metaphor of female power and men\u2019s fear of it,\u201d which implies that the fear is merely external. You don\u2019t have to be a woman to be subjected to the psychic pressure that leads to such fracturing, but if you are a woman (or, in Ellison\u2019s case, black, or James\u2019 case a deeply closeted homosexual), you are far more likely to be.", "I first learned of Jackson back in 1989 as a ninth grader reading her short story Charles.", "", "", "", "", "It wasn\u2019t feminist critics who kept the flame of Jackson\u2019s reputation lit over the past half-century, but genre writers. Since 2007, the", "have recognized \u201cthe legacy of Shirley Jackson\u2019s writing,\u201d by singling out works of \u201coutstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror, and the dark fantastic.\u201d Stephen King, in the 1981 collection", ", pronounced", "on par with James\u2019", ". But this association with horror led many critics, in Jackson\u2019s day and since, to treat her work, patronizingly, as a vehicle for chills. (One critic made Hyman apoplectic by describing Jackson as \u201ca kind of Virginia Werewoolf among the s\u00e9ance-fiction writers,\u201d as if anyone who could produce a line like that were in a position to rule on another writer\u2019s \u201cseriousness.\u201d) Just as there is no reason why a novel by a woman should be any less significant than a novel by a man, there is no reason why a story with a ghost in it should be automatically deemed more frivolous than a coming-of-age yarn.
