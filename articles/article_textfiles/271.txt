{"Body": ["Fantagraphics Books", "Do we ever understand those we love? What price do we pay to know them? These are the questions at the heart of Daniel Clowes\u2019 new comic", ", his first major release in almost five years.", "When we meet the book\u2019s protagonist, Jack, he\u2019s anxiously but joyfully coming to terms with the discovery that his wife\u2014who shares her name with the book\u2014is pregnant. Though they\u2019ve been together for six years, he doggedly maintains an idealized image of her. At one point, she alludes to her stormy life before she met him, claiming, \u201cIt was like a horrible reality show.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about it,\u201d Jack responds, his eyes closed, wilfully blinding himself to her history. In the following panel Clowes draws the two from behind, backs turned to their separate pasts as they walk together toward a shared future.", "That future is cruelly interrupted: A few pages in, Jack comes home to find Patience dead on the floor of their apartment. Despite his overwhelming grief, the police accuse him of murdering her, only to exonerate him once they actually evaluate the evidence. Seventeen years pass, the crime still unsolved, and he never stops mourning her. He refuses to even touch another woman, convinced that to do so would be to betray Patience, that there \u201cmay be some little piece of her, some cell left on my skin.\u201d If he\u2019s still in love, it\u2019s because he\u2019s never lost the unblemished image of her that he invented years before. But to get her back, he\u2019ll have to ruin it.", "Jack gains the power to undo his greatest tragedy when he steals a time machine from a sad-sack inventor. He sets a course for Patience\u2019s youth, hoping that he can learn who might have wanted to harm her so he can take his vengeance before they take theirs. Though this device promises to help him save his beloved wife, using it means confronting the parts of her life he\u2019s always ignored. To protect the woman he loves, he risks disrupting the very fictions that underwrote his love for her.", "All time travelers suffer, and Jack is no exception, watching everything go wrong on his quest to set things right. Though he keeps telling himself that he\u2019s just there to observe, he can\u2019t help but intervene in the younger Patience\u2019s misadventures. In the process, he courts what would be an even worse loss for him\u2014that the best way to save Patience might be accidentally engineering a future in which she never makes her way to him at all.", "Confronting this terrifying possibility entails negotiating a truth that we all work through, sooner or later: Everything our partners have been through brought them closer to us. Much as we might like to save them from", "suffering, we know that without such pain we would never know them at all\u2014and so we suffer too. Learning this, we\u2019re forced to accept that there are parts of them that we can never share in, parts that define and shape them, forging them into the people we love. Similar issues play out in Leanne Shapton\u2019s", ", a catalog of ex-lovers that", ". Here, however, the lesson takes on a more sorrowful weight: Jack\u2019s journey may be the stuff of science fiction, but it demonstrates what we all endure when we delve into our partners\u2019 pasts. Even the most happily coupled know that there is no time machine more devastating than an attentive ear.", "Inevitably, any reflection on coupledom is bound vibrate with anxiety, but", "as a whole is a surprisingly calm work, probably Clowes\u2019 most confident and clear-headed book to date. Visually, he\u2019s often been a promiscuous stylist, varying his technique from one episode of a story to the next. Especially in later books such as", "and", ", those shifts have allowed Clowes to maintain a degree of emotional detachment from his narratives, turning", "into a joke. That uneasiness\u2014which often reads as contempt\u2014has largely vanished here. There\u2019s still something distant about his tone, but it\u2019s distance of a more comfortable kind. Clowes conveys that attitude with the thickly inked lines that define his characters\u2019 features, lines that mark their individuality, even when they strive to dissolve into one another and the world around them. It\u2019s there too in Patience\u2019s unnerving gaze on the cover, a stirring counterpoint to her husband\u2019s loving obliviousness.", "A similar clarity of purpose is evident in Clowes\u2019 writing. Narration\u2014mostly from Jack\u2019s perspective, but occasionally from Patience\u2019s\u2014accompanies long sections of the book. Though Clowes has always been a deft prose stylist, his best works have typically eschewed this sort of first person commentary. In those that do employ it\u2014early short stories such as \u201cCaricature\u201d and \u201cBlack Nylon,\u201d for example\u2014the narration often drips with self-loathing, his characters giving the uncomfortable impression that they\u2019re speaking for their author, voicing his contempt for himself. While", "frequently exhibits that same emotion, for once Clowes himself doesn\u2019t seem to be either its subject or its object. His new book puts ugly feelings on display, but doesn\u2019t wallow in them.", "As it approaches its conclusion,", "suggests that breaking free from self-loathing may also mean breaking free from selfishness. Jack loves Patience to the point of madness, but everything he does for her is arguably still about him. These same themes were central to the melancholy concluding chapters of", ", which suggested that love sometimes functions as a limit, holding back both self and other.", ", however, goes further, showing that to fixate on one\u2019s own needs is to tarry with self-annihilation:", "Tellingly, Jack remains a void throughout\u2014seemingly without friends or family, he has even less of a past than Patience does at the start. In one early sequence, he tells her, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hang out with other people. I only like you and the baby,\u201d referring to their still unborn child. His love for her blinds him to everything else, every other feature of his life.", "Fantagraphics Books", "Patience, for her own part, goes through even more, though we see less of it. She never learns, as Jack does, what her partner", "before her, but she does discover what he might", "after her, what he might be without her. This is her curse, and it is, we gradually realize, far more powerful than his: Etymologically, her name borrows from a Latinate root that means suffering. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more acute emotional expression of that state than the realization that we only ever constitute a tiny fragment of our beloved\u2019s time.", "And time, ultimately, is what matters here most. Comics aren\u2019t time machines, but they are chronological atlases, each panel a frozen instant, each page a map. Exploiting this quality of comics,", "Clowes dramatizes the painful work of putting together the pieces of a beloved\u2019s history.
