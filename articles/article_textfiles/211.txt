In 1893, prominent Austrian surgeon Theodor Billroth commented, \u201cThe surgeon who should attempt to suture a wound of the heart would lose the respect of his colleagues.\u201d With modern medicine this reluctance faded.

Despite cardiovascular\u00a0disease being the leading cause of mortality, research into it is not the glitzy headline it once was: \u201cIt\u2019s all simple plumbing and a pump,\u201d a neurologist recently commented to me.", "Biologist and writer Rob Dunn thinks otherwise. In his new book", ", Dunn reminds us that the heart remains a fascinating, far-from-understood organ with an incredible biologic and cultural history. Even as scientists methodically map the human brain\u2019s 100 billion neurons, the heart\u2014and heart research\u2014keeps on beating (sorry).", "The book opens in a dingy, makeshift Chicago hospital where, in 1893\u2014the same year Billroth cautioned hands off the heart\u2014a young black surgeon named Daniel Hale Williams performed the first successful cardiac surgery. His patient had been stabbed in the heart during a bar fight. Williams, seeing no other options, cut into the man's chest wall, pushed a rib aside, and for the first time sewed up a live human pericardium, the fibrous sac surrounding the heart.", "Despite some awkward leaps in chronology, Dunn then manages to weave thousands of years of convoluted historical and scientific anecdotes into a clear, engaging account of the heart\u2019s long and gruesome history\u2014a jarring reminder of the guts and gore behind so much scientific discovery. By the 4", "century B.C., the Egyptians were no longer weighing hearts\u2014they were performing the first known scientific dissections at Alexandria\u2019s medical school. Their subjects: live criminals.\u00a0 Galen made a living patching up gladiators (while peeking at their organs in the process). He also seeded our current understanding of the cardiovascular system by dismantling every animal he could get his hands on\u2014the elephants must have been a chore\u2014and, in doing so, kicked off 2,000 years of animal testing.", "The Renaissance thinkers were key to understanding the inner workings of the heart. They probed prisoners, robbed graves, and were occasionally burned at the stake for questioning God\u2019s domain. Dunn spends a good deal of time on Leonardo da Vinci, an avid dissector. The polymathic Italian observed rivers to understand blood flow and, it\u2019s speculated, may have produced the ultimate treatise on anatomy. Sadly, it was lost to history after Leonardo\u2019s 1519 death.", "Photo by Casey Tarpy", "Dunn moves on to more recent, more astounding advances, like German surgeon Werner Forssmann feeding a catheter up his own arm vein and into his heart in 1929. After literally kicking off a colleague trying to yank out the tube, Forssmann quickly snapped two X-rays confirming success\u2014afterward, according to Dunn, he \u201chad good food and a lot of good wine and celebrated the birth of a new field of medicine, what would come to be called cardiology.\u201d (The moment also gives Dunn\u2019s book its title.) The madness continues with a delve into transplant science and its long, strange history of chimeric experimentation, including an Ethiopian leg transplant in 400, a Chicago surgeon transplanting bits of cadaver testes into his own in the interest of enhanced virility, and the race to transplant a human heart. The latter tale thrills, though the back stories on other cardiac modernities\u2014bypass surgeries, angiograms, and electrocardiograms included\u2014can drag. During the saga of the pacemaker battery, I hoped something would jolt the book back to life.", "The narrative shines where Dunn seems most at home: the lab. He has a knack for translating complex, cutting-edge science into clear and approachable language, as when he traces the evolution of our own heart and blood vessels back to the simple sponge: \u201cIt is filled with pipes through which the sea can be moved \u2026 the sea itself is part of the sponge\u2019s heart,\u201d he writes. Dunn explains how diet shapes our heart health\u2014how compounds called sialic acids from animal meat find their way into our heart cells, causing autoimmune activity that might contribute to heart disease. He also profiles researchers mathematically modeling the heart down to the individual cell, and others growing hearts from scratch using plastic mesh and stem cells.", "If there\u2019s one recurring omission in", ", it\u2019s a deeper discussion of the often brutal cost of scientific knowledge. Dunn does examine the controversies shadowing human heart research through the years, acknowledging the often queasy Frankensteinian bravado behind scientific progress. Particularly heated was the 1970s debate on what constitutes \u201cdeath\u201d: a dead heart or a dead brain. (Surgeons were itching for live hearts to transplant and often went to ethically dubious lengths to get them.) However, a closer look at the lives of the animals poked, prodded, and sacrificed in the name of science is warranted. Even today, find yourself in a surgical \u201cbeagle lab\u201d and PETA might have a new recruit.", "Dunn\u2019s straightforward style, clunky metaphors and all, could benefit from a consult with the science writer literati: a hint of Mary Roach\u2019s wit, Atul Gawande\u2019s eloquence, Oliver Sacks\u2019 cerebral neurologic weirdness.
