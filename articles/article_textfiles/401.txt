I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s just no room for you to park your car in this lot. Maybe you can find room to park on the street. But I doubt it.\u2019 It\u2019s like you could almost see the truncated syllogism in their head. Like, I bought the car, how could there not be a place to park it? Surely it comes with a parking space.\u201d", "It\u2019s not hard to imagine the would-be patron\u2019s bafflement: Parking, from the moment we drive the car off the lot, seems to be everywhere. No one ever has\u2014or could, really\u2014put an exact number on the number of spaces in the United States. One common estimate is eight spaces for every vehicle, which would yield a number approaching 2 billion spaces; other estimates set it at 844 million spaces. The cost of these spaces, measured, as", ", \u201cin the form of adverse health impacts, building damage, and reduced agricultural production, to name a few,\u201d ranges somewhere between $4 billion and $20 billion per year.", "Parking can reflect the health of the state: Witness the collective anxiety brought on by the aerial photographs of the 245-acre parking lot at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, a dystopian Disneyland filled with fleets of unwanted cars at the height of the financial crisis. Or the psychic malaise that open asphalt engenders, like an early sailor\u2019s dread of the open sea, at a failing mall. (Indeed, companies like", "use aerial imagery of retail parking lots \u201cto determine year-over-year traffic growth, market share, and comps forecasts.\u201d) It can also seem a topographic plague, and I am not talking here about \u201c", "\u201d but cities like Buffalo, where density and urban fabric were sundered by pervasive", "; or suburbs where buildings and site capacities themselves", "as surrounding parking grew larger. The depthless scale of parking lots betrays what", ".", "The parking lot is one of those forms so visible that we no longer see it (or indeed, what lies beneath: Everything from Hitler\u2019s bunker to Henry VIII\u2019s \u201clost chapel\u201d has been covered by parking). Of course, another reason we do not see it is there is not much to see.

Writes Ben-Joseph: \u201cI could barely think of one.\u201d", "While parking garages have received", ", the humble lot has been rather marooned, not only culturally but by the profession. As Ben-Joseph notes, in the 463-page", ", a common reference book for planners, parking lots loom as a kind of uncomfortable afterthought, with a scant three paragraphs of guidance. (\u201cParking lots should offer direct and easy access for people walking between their vehicles and the building entrances.\u201d) Roughly speaking, more attention has gone into determining the proper geometries of the spaces themselves than to the overall design of the lot and how it relates to its surroundings; nevertheless, as Joseph quotes the text of a design competition, \u201cthere is almost no other place of the public environment that people experience more in their daily lives.\u201d", "Can parking lots be great? Given that the bar is set so low to begin with, it doesn\u2019t take much to make them better. Merely adding a small tree island planter in the middle of the lot (as opposed to the edge, where most developers choose to place them), notes Ben-Joseph, has been shown to reduce surface temperatures by as much as 30 degrees. Some of the better designs (like", ") do not forget that the parking lot is, in essence, a building\u2019s lobby, and strive for some sense of occasion. There are some great meta jokes, like the since-destroyed SITE-designed", "at a shopping mall in Connecticut, featuring 20 junked cars, emerging tar-pit style from the black pavement. Some sport engineering improvements which channel storm-water or reduce the \u201cthermal battery\u201d effects of lots. But perhaps tellingly, the most visually appealing examples in the book, like cobblestoned \u201cshared space\u201d in Germany, seem to work because they do not look like parking at all.", "But there is a difference between mitigating noxious effects and creating good places. That\u2019s the big game Ben-Joseph is after: \u201cDesigned with conscious intent, parking lots could actually become significant public spaces, contributing as much to their communities as great boulevards, parks, or plazas.\u201d And, in theory, just as any open space can be converted into a parking lot, however temporarily (as for county fairs), a parking lot can be converted, however temporarily, into a public space.", "And so parking lots house farmers\u2019 markets on the weekend, or temporarily carnivals, or even political protests: A number of the Occupy protests actually occurred in parking lots. (Whether this represents spontaneous public space or a", "is an open question.) On the fringes of Wal-Marts, one even finds temporary settlements. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen people sitting around the asphalt telling campfire stories,\u201d a Wal-Mart spokesperson says of the \u201cboondockers\u201d who congregate in lots in their RVs. One conjures Edward Abbey rolling in his unmarked grave in the Cabeza Prieta desert\u2014and it\u2019s thankful he was buried so remotely, to avoid the fate of one person described in the book, whose lone, fenced grave was ultimately surrounded by parking.", "Photograph by Dominick Reuter.", "The dilemma with weekend farmers\u2019 markets or Sunday pregame tailgate parties comes on Monday morning, when that festival atmosphere is now a windswept void. Ben-Joseph wants to know what can be done to make stadium parking less glaringly nonfunctional, but the better question may be why stadiums need massive parking lots to begin with. Attend a soccer match at, say, London\u2019s Chelsea Stadium, and instead of tailgating, one finds people walking from local pubs to the stadium, a boisterous, merry procession. And the next day, those same pubs are doling out fish and chips to regulars.", "As noble as Ben-Joseph\u2019s endeavor is, one wonders if the limitations of the form are simply too daunting. The real question is: Can parking lots become great spaces", "parking lots? Could they be places that people are drawn to, want to linger in, rally around, where children can play? People adapt to parking lots, fashioning public uses out of them because, primarily, they have to. (I speak from teenaged experience.) But would anyone\u2014and the ultimate test here would be someone outside of a car\u2014go to a parking lot by choice? To consider the Project for Public Spaces list of what does and does not represent place-making, parking lots fall overwhelmingly into the negative ledger: \u201cDesign-driven,\u201d \u201cexclusionary,\u201d \u201cmonolithic development,\u201d \u201coverly accommodating of the car,\u201d \u201cprivatized,\u201d \u201cone-dimensional,\u201d and so on.", "\u201cWhy can\u2019t parking lots be modest paradises?\u201d Ben-Joseph asks. Why can\u2019t they be \u201ca pleasant place to visit and coexist with cars\u201d? Well, for one, they are filled with drivers, who have the unfortunate habit of striking people in parking lots (when not getting", "over claiming spots). I do know of one such place where it\u2019s pleasant to visit and coexist with cars. It\u2019s called a car show.
