But a culture never entirely discards its roots, and allegory, which first appeared in the waning years of the Roman Empire, is one of the foundations of Western literature. Maybe if we understood it better, we\u2019d realize how much we owe to it. Besides, the allegorical imagination lives on, just not in the places where critics think they see it.", "An allegory, in short, is not just another word for a metaphor. In essence, it\u2019s a form of fiction that represents immaterial things as images. It calls attention to what it\u2019s doing, typically by giving those images overtly thematic labels, like presenting the Seven Deadly Sins as a procession of people named Lust, Sloth, Pride, and the rest.

Yet", "was a colossal hit; for two centuries, it was the second book purchased by any Protestant household affluent and literate enough to own its own Bible. Everyone read about the narrator who falls asleep and dreams of a man named Christian fleeing the City of Destruction while bearing a heavy burden (representing the knowledge of his own sins) on his back. A figure named Evangelist instructs Christian on how to reach the Celestial City, a long journey past such perils as the Slough (swamp) of Despond and the Hill of Difficulty, where people with names like Mr. Worldly Wiseman and Hypocrisy attempt to lead him astray.", "The low opinion in which allegory is now widely held can be blamed on", "The book is pious and manifestly didactic, although I can testify from experience that a young-enough reader can still find it an entertaining adventure yarn.

You can\u2019t really congratulate yourself for ferreting out the moral of Christian fighting his way through the fancy city of Vanity Fair or the mining town named Lucre. Should a book or a film present its argument so simply that even a child can discern it, what\u2019s left to talk about? Merely language, story, and imagery\u2014all the pleasures that art is made of.", "Do we even know how to read such a book anymore? C.S. Lewis thought not. He wrote the definitive treatise on the form in 1936:", "We know Lewis today as the author of", "and as a writer of Christian apologetics, but before all that he was a sensational literary critic\u2014and I mean", "literally. Perceptive, erudite, and witty, he also wrote with an infectious vividness about the experience of reading, of mingling with an author\u2019s mind and imagination. Here\u2019s how he described the allegories of Martianus Capella, an influential writer of the early fifth century:", "Lewis\u2019 apologetics can be parochial, but his criticism flings open its doors and windows to welcome in any writer with even a wisp of distinction. Most remarkable of all, his scholarly works are never, ever incomprehensible or boring, even when they concern the most tedious literature. (Lewis\u2019 biographer, A.N. Wilson, wrote that his one great fault as a critic was his \u201centhusiastic generosity\u201d toward authors \u201cwho are not really as interesting as he makes them sound.\u201d)", "A medievalist, Lewis was forever defending the Middle Ages from the glib notion that they constituted an intellectual and artistic fallow period between the classical world and the Renaissance. (He is completely convincing on this point.) We often fail to understand the beauty of medieval art, he argued, because we experience the world and our place in it so differently from the people of that time. We can\u2019t appreciate medieval allegory until we make a concerted effort to imagine what it was like to inhabit the world as they saw it, as a divinely ordered universe in which \u201ccertain sympathies, antipathies, and strivings [are] inherent in matter itself.\u00a0 Everything has its right place, its home, the region that suits it.\u201d", "Lewis traces the origins of allegory to a period in late antiquity when, for undetermined reasons, the Western concept of a virtuous life changed profoundly. In the", "Aristotle described virtue as a skill to be learned by practice, until it becomes not just second nature, but an end in itself. \u201cThe man who does not enjoy doing noble actions is not a good man at all,\u201d he wrote. You don\u2019t become a good cook by conquering your desire to cook badly; similarly, you become a good man by simultaneously acquiring the expertise and reaping its rewards.", "The emerging idea that virtue instead results from an ongoing inner battle against our own worst impulses was not exclusively Christian, but it fit perfectly with the Christian belief in humanity\u2019s fallen nature. We\u2019re so familiar with this concept of the psyche as a theater of struggle between opposing forces that it\u2019s difficult to conceive of a time when it was relatively new, the time when allegory was born. \u201cTo fight against \u2018temptation,\u2019 \u201d Lewis writes, \u201cis also to explore the inner world; and it is scarcely less plain that to do so is to be already on the verge of allegory.\u201d", "Yet today we associate allegory with a lack of the \u201cround\u201d fictional characters we value most, characters whose believability resides at least partly in their internal conflicts. This is a standard set by the novel, a relatively recent literary form that (for the most part) aims to produce a naturalistic depiction of the world. Allegory doesn\u2019t work that way. The characters in allegories like the 13", "-century poem", "or Edmund Spenser\u2019s 16", "-century masterpiece,", "are \u201cflat\u201d by contemporary standards, possessed of only a few traits and behaving with inhuman consistency.", "But, as Lewis demonstrates in a long, virtuosic reading of", "this is because they aren\u2019t actually meant to be", ". Instead these people, the objects they handle, and the spaces they occupy all represent aspects of the self.", "describes the courtship of a noble maiden by a courtier. Like many allegories it is framed as a dream, a sign that we\u2019ve entered into a psychological interior. The lover seeks the Garden of Love, where he meets such clashing figures as Mirth, Companionship, Pride, and Shame. The lady herself seems strangely dematerialized because, as Lewis observes, \u201cher character is distributed among personifications.\u201d", "But, Lewis hastens to add, an allegory is not merely an equation to be solved, leaving you free to \u201cthrow aside the allegorical imagery as something which has now done its work.\u201d Allegorical reading requires sustaining both image and meaning in the reader\u2019s mind, as equally valued components of the work. \u201cIt is not enough,\u201d Lewis writes, \u201cto see that the dreamer gazing into the fountain signifies the lover first looking into the lady\u2019s eyes. We must feel that the scene by the fountain is an imaginative likeness of the lover\u2019s experience.\u201d We must be able to see the sparkling water and the shining eyes at the same time and recognize them to be facets of a singular, layered understanding that includes the recognition of other, abstract qualities as well, such as the purity of her spirit.", "The literate people of the Middle Ages were experts at comprehending art in this way. They routinely compounded vast amounts of meaning into certain ideas or motifs, partly because they were always attempting to integrate the cultural legacy of classical paganism into Christian theology. For them, \u201cVenus\u201d signified multiple things simultaneously: a planet, a Roman goddess with a set of stories attached to her, a literary figure, the image of feminine beauty, the force of erotic love, God\u2019s will manifested in the fruitful union of a man and a woman, and so on. Christianity formed a bedrock for this way of thinking, but no one of these is the \u201ctrue\u201d meaning of Venus to which all others can be reduced. Their characters may seem \u201cthin\u201d when compared with those in a great novel, but their images are much fuller and richer.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!

Join us today.", "Lewis would surely argue that it is the modern reader who, viewing allegory as reductive, shows a lack of subtlety. In a great allegory, the imagery is not a code for the underlying theme; it is every bit as important as theme. Perhaps the greatest allegory, Edmund Spenser\u2019s", "offers a case in point. Lewis was Spenser\u2019s foremost champion, rescuing the Elizabethan poet from near-obscurity and restoring", "to the canon\u2014to the dismay of many undergraduates but to the delight of others. Lewis first read the epic poem as a boy, devouring it as a tale of brave knights battling dragons, giants, and wicked enchanters against a sylvan landscape splashed with gore. A grasp of the religious and political implications of such figures as the beautiful but nefarious lady Duessa (an allegory for the Catholic Church) or the Redcross Knight (who embodies the spirit of England) would come later, but many generations of readers have been well-satisfied with the surface alone.", "The prescriptivist cause is a futile rearguard action against the inevitable plundering of our language, and I applaud its champions wherever they exist, so kudos to Laura Miller here for rightly pointing out the correct definition of allegory, a word...", "", "", "", "", "is a vast, ravishing spectacle\u2014one that contemporary readers can find pretty inaccessible due to Spenser\u2019s use of language and diction that is deliberately archaic, even for his own time.

And while many of Spenser\u2019s allegorical concerns have become obsolete, it only takes a scene like the Redcross Knight\u2019s encounter with shaggy, gaunt Despair as he crouches in his cave, surrounded by the knights he has persuaded to kill themselves, to remind a reader of the form\u2019s potency.", "Spenser\u2019s Despair calls to mind the dementors, the most terrifying monsters in the", "series, although J.K.

This is where the spirit of allegory lives on, in novels and films when the action feels as if it is taking place inside one person\u2019s head. Sometimes a superhero comic or film slips into an allegorical mode, less by mimicking some timely political situation than by creating an antagonist like the Penguin, who resembles an updating of the medieval allegory for greed. The Hero\u2019s Journey, a staple of screenwriting courses and, alas, the model for so many mediocre films, is really just an allegorical narrative slapped with the more palatable label of \u201cmyth.\u201d Yet the contemporary artworks most redolent of allegory\u2019s heady psychic atmosphere are both archetypal and dreamlike: the novels of Haruki Murakami and the films of David Lynch, to name two examples.
