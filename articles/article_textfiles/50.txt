I often spend entire mornings this way, especially during winter, and my productivity is just fine. In fact, because I don\u2019t tie up my best thinking hours primping and getting resettled, I\u2019d venture to say that I actually work more efficiently lying down. Working from home is a spectacular privilege, so why waste it on fashion and good posture? Just because one slouches doesn\u2019t make one a slouch.", "All of this puts me in a receptive frame of mind to read", ", an idiosyncratic new examination of the one-third of life\u2014or more!\u2014we spend recumbent. Lying down, German author Bernd Brunner writes, \u201cspans the human condition, from complete passivity to the most passionate of activities.\u201d (The book was translated by Lori Lantz.) It\u2019s the position in which \u201cwe sleep and dream, make love, contemplate, give ourselves over to wistful moods, daydream, and suffer.\u201d Almost every day begins and ends in a bed, and so does almost every human life.", "If Brunner has a big idea, it\u2019s that lying down is due for a revival in the Western world, a culture too long obsessed with achievement and motion and noise and, therefore, uprightness. That makes rest a kind of rebellion. The book begins with reassurance: \u201cIf you\u2019re lying down right now, there\u2019s no need to defend yourself.\u201d After all, life on the X axis is natural, enjoyable, and healthful. It\u2019s good for the soul, the mind, and the body. By the end, Brunner is optimistically declaring that \u201cthe age of the New Horizontal has arrived.\u201d", "Courtesy of Melville House", "Well, perhaps. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much evidence for this, but Brunner at least takes an extremely enjoyable path to get there. Over the course of 31 brief chapters, he meanders from topic to topic, as minds do when daydreaming. In one chapter, he muses on the scandalous reputation of the chaise longue at the turn of the last century. In the next he\u2019s describing the infamous 1998 Tracey Emin installation \u201c", ",\u201d strewn with cigarettes and condoms. In a quick 167 pages, he covers hypnosis, gravity, drugs, bedbugs, the psychology of various sleep positions, feng shui, Egyptian mummies, the effect of climate on sleep, and La-Z-Boy recliners. If that sounds exhausting, it\u2019s not, but why not go ahead and take a nap anyway?", "Brunner, who has written similarly peripatetic books on bears and Christmas trees, doesn\u2019t belabor any of these topics or even spend more than a few paragraphs mulling most of them over. There\u2019s no real sustained argument here, and many chapters sort of drift off at the end. That\u2019s one of this slight book\u2019s charms, and another nice echo of the way the lying-down brain works: Grand emotional or intellectual breakthroughs often arrive on the brink of sleep, but that\u2019s no time to be writing a thesis. Think big thoughts, sure, but do it briefly, hazily. You can do the heavy lifting in the morning.", "Naturally, sleep is one of the book\u2019s major themes. Brunner digs up a 1953 pamphlet called \u201cSleep Before Midnight,\u201d written by a German school principal named Theodor St\u00f6ckmann. St\u00f6ckmann promoted his discovery of \u201cthe law of natural time,\u201d which requires going to bed at sunset and rising naturally no later than sunrise. \u201cBy consciously and willingly submitting to the cosmic dictates of the sun\u2019s orbit,\u201d St\u00f6ckmann concluded, \u201cwe must become people of the sun, children of the light.\u201d He wasn\u2019t so far off: Contemporary sleep research indicates that artificial light, particularly the \u201c", "\u201d of iPads and energy-efficient light bulbs, is terrible for sleep.", "For an activity whose very essence is rest, sleep is a persistent cause of human anxiety. There\u2019s insomnia, nightmares, and stiff necks. And then there\u2019s the judgment from scolds who don\u2019t want anyone to enjoy it. British preacher and theologian John Wesley took the typical sourpuss approach in 1782 in", "against sleeping late: \u201cA still greater objection to the not rising early, the not redeeming all the time we can from sleep, is, it hurts the soul, as well as the body,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a sin against God.\u201d", "Courtesy of Ahmet Necati Uzer", "Wesley, the founder of Methodism, got up at 4 a.m. every day.

Brunner warns against the romantic temptation to sleep outdoors: \u201cCaution is especially called for in forests,\u201d he writes, ticking off problems like strange sounds, \u201cupsetting scents,\u201d nosy animals, and damp ground. \u201cNothing about it encourages a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\u00a0 There is a reason God invented mattresses. And yes, Brunner gets to those, too. In a chapter on their history, he traces the development of the coil spring, the box spring, and the water bed, conceived in the early 19", "century by a Scottish doctor who placed a slab of rubber on a basin of water and called it a \u201chydrostatic bed for invalids.\u201d", "Lying down is not only about sleeping, of course. It\u2019s also about sex, which Brunner doesn\u2019t spend much time on, and contemplation, which he does. And why don\u2019t we do as the Greeks and Romans did and eat lying down? Despite the mini-revival of lounges and nightclubs that encourage reclining while socializing, Brunner reluctantly concedes that \u201ctables and chairs have existed for thousands of years, and their anonymous inventors developed them for a reason.\u201d", "Can I claim lounging around as a feminist statement?", "Then, of course, there\u2019s work. \u201cPeople who work while lying down often don\u2019t like to admit it,\u201d he writes, correctly. But plenty of us do manage to get work done there. Proust finished", "in bed. Mark Twain, Edith Sitwell, and William Wordsworth were all in the habit of writing from bed, and Henri Matisse sometimes painted there using brushes attached to long sticks. Truman Capote referred to himself once as a \u201ccompletely horizontal author,\u201d and said, \u201cI can\u2019t think unless I\u2019m lying down.\u201d Edith Wharton, Brunner writes, \u201cretreated to bed to escape rigid expectations about what women should wear,\u201d raising the appealing possibility of lounging around as a feminist statement. Is it too late for me to claim that?", "Despite Brunner\u2019s belief that we\u2019re entering a new age of recline, there\u2019s all too much evidence that in fact, we\u2019re only speeding up.
