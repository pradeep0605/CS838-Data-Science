{"Body": ["Illustration by Ethan Rilly", "Stavros Stavros Mavrakis had a rough night. He was \u201cin bed, cold, with no woman but plenty of woman troubles\u201d and \u201cdreaming of home,\u201d Crete. The island missed him. It \u201cwas going through a tough time economically without people like him,\u201d hardworking New Jersey diner owners with a nose for business and solid family values. But what follows, in Annie Liontas\u2019 sly and generous debut novel", ", is no contemporary exploration of the Greek crisis\u2014more a madcap unfolding of a family crisis. In his dream, Stavros encounters the Goat of Death. The Goat strikes the ground 10 times with his hoof: 10 days. Stavros rises, shaken, and drives to work, where his daily routines allow him to dismiss the vision as irrelevant. But then his longtime second-in-command Marina visits him in his office and announces, \u201cThere is a goat here for you, Stavro.\u201d", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "This is the launch pad for a 350-page meditation on family myths and realities", "as warbled at", "by a drunken singer with a dry sense of humor. What do you do when the Goat of Death arrives at your doorstep? For Stavros, the answer is: Write a blistering email in broken English to all the women in your life, telling them what they\u2019re doing wrong and how you, in your patriarchal wisdom, would fix it.", "Start with your oldest child, Stavroula, now in her 30s. She is your mirror image: bullheaded, gumptious, no-nonsense, intuitive with food. She\u2019s in love with the daughter of the restaurateur whose kitchen she runs. Tell her to grow out her hair, emphatically spiky, for \u201cthere is a way to be for the normal society, and you are not it.\u201d", "Next comes Litza, who, \u201cLitza, let me explain you something. Litza, you have problems.\u201d Furiously beautiful, damaged, as volcanically explosive as her dad, Litza gets married and then divorced a week later, smashes a stool into the diner\u2019s glass dessert case for seemingly no reason. What she needs is God; you must tell her to go to church.", "The youngest daughter, Ruby, as precious and self-contained as her name, dates a guy \u201cwith the facial hair of an onion,\u201d but is \u201cotherwise doing OK. \u201d Remind her that her father\u2019s mustache \u201cis a fist\u201d and not to \u201cgo marrying some losers.\u201d (In fact, she\u2019s just eloped.)", "Faced with the melancholy and loneliness of the universe, Stavros fights back with certainty, bravado, an", "", ".", "As for Carol, the ex-wife, the ambitious Starbucks manager who dumped you when you acquired a mistress, she did not honor you on Earth, but let her do so now as you enter the hereafter. Tell that \u201cnothing-nobody Dick Hunter,\u201d that \u201cVenti Mocha Whip-cream White Whore,\u201d to wear only black for a year.", "Around Stavros\u2019 life purl other women who, for all their neon-edged characterization, don\u2019t make it into the letter. (The book intercuts scenes from characters\u2019 pasts and presents.) Rhonda, the mistress, entrances our man because she is large, smart, achieving, and black\u2014she kicks him to the curb when he treats her like a sexy curiosity rather than a person. Dina, biological mother to Stavroula and Litza, is a victim of child abuse who slides into drug addiction and represents a frailty Stavros can\u2019t abide. Marina reigns in the diner\u2019s primeval kitchen, another Cretan transplant, granite-faced, superstitious, with an internal monologue that occasionally breaks into the text like light from an older, poetic world. (\u201cWork is the moon that hangs the day,\u201d she reminds herself at one point, waking up before dawn.)", "And so we think we know what to expect from the novel in our hands: a man and his women, or his woman", "\u201cLet me explain you,\u201d Stavros will pronounce, and we will spend the rest of the book laughing at the mansplainer, at his pride, bluster, and blindness, while cheering on the true heroes, his daughters and co-workers and exes. They will wrestle with his complicated legacy, finding patches of identity free of his shadow and other patches where the shadow drops a welcome coolness. Liontas\u2019 challenge will be to make us care enough about Stavros to keep reading, to humorously or poignantly expose his vulnerabilities, until some tender fantasy of family kicks in, and the clan gathers, and we find out alongside the", "and everyone else whether he lives or dies.", "is very much the book I just described. But it also wants to be more than that book. Yes, it is a funny and moving confection, a gently ironic critique of masculinity in which a father\u2019s desperate desire to be known and loved masquerades as a last-ditch attempt to elucidate the world for his family. Yes, it\u2019s also an immigrant tale punctuated by extravagantly sensuous odes to good food. (\u201cThe blackberries were a peal of bells hanging in a church tower, moon unveiling their shoulders.\u201d) But there are turns of phrase and expansive, double-jointed moments that speak to Liontas\u2019 bigger, weirder ambition. She picks up not-so-fresh ideas about clarity and authenticity, then teases them into snarls: When Litza cracks the dessert case with a stool, it\u2019s tempting to read those transparent shards as the novel\u2019s last word on explanation itself, even as the boundary between inner and outer falls away and the \u201ctragic\u201d wreckage of cake that spills forth makes the air smell of sugar.", ", stuffed with sadly predictable beats and eerie, riddling sentences, as thematically familiar as it is tonally tricky and unique, is, well, hard to explain you.", "Maybe that\u2019s intentional. Liontas strews her own prose with aborted explanations: \u201cLitza knew not to suggest that they drive together, so.\u201d \u201cAnd he saw how well that went, so.\u201d The flattening effect\u2014each", "like blinds snapping closed, or a door slamming\u2014reveals how neatly an explanation can shut things down, deflect an opportunity for true connection.

All I am asking, he tried again, is that you come with me to some few places", "\u201d But of course Carol already knows what her ex wants. She requires not clarification but respect\u2014and the extent to which Stavros can\u2019t figure out the difference is his entire problem.", "My favorite kind of failed explanation in", "is a disorganized flight of image and feeling dressed up as logic. \u201cBeing alone in the last days of life,\u201d Liontas writes, her", "so artful we feel comfortable wandering through a diverse array of heads (this one is Stavros\u2019), \u201cwas like being the last star in a galaxy, watching one neighbor star after another blink into nothing, until even the faraway nub stars are just light-years \u2026 and all Stavros is left with is debris from the first cough of creation.\u201d Then, triumphantly, as if arriving at an irresistible conclusion: \u201cAnd does Stavros look like a cough? No.\u201d", "I wrote in my book\u2019s margin, delighted by the swerve from lyrical self-pity to swaggering nonsense.", "Faced with the melancholy and loneliness of the universe, Stavros fights back with certainty, bravado, an", "", ".
