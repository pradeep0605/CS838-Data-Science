{"Body": ["Illustration by Noah Van Sciver.", "I had an odd experience while reading", ", Margaret Talbot\u2019s wry, wonderful new book about her irrepressible actor father, Lyle, and American entertainment over the course of the 20", "century. Every time I opened it, an accompanying soundtrack began to play in my head.", "At first, it wasn\u2019t much more than the howl of winds moving over turn-of-the-last-century Nebraska, but that soon gave way to carnival noises\u2014fairway barkers, snippets of music coming from the depths of tents. Then it was the steady rhythm of trains carrying itinerant theater troupes through the dark Midwestern night. Later, whenever I picked it up, I kept overhearing the sounds of 1940s Hollywood royalty clinking glasses at cocktail parties, or the thwack of tennis balls on the courts at Hearst Castle as they let the old man win. I caught the fox trot beat from the Trocadero and the Cocoanut Grove. As I neared the end of the book, I strained to hear the noises of four children, first splashing in the pool, later arguing about the war in Vietnam, all the while listening to their finally settled father telling them stories of his long ago youth.", "These, of course, are the sounds of a still-young America coming into its own. In", "they are also the sounds of Lyle Talbot coming into", "own. His career as a performer, while it never quite reached stratospheric heights, dovetailed perfectly with every major shift in American entertainment before landing gently in a very happy family life that began long after he had given up hope it ever would. It\u2019s a convergence that allows his daughter to thread his story\u2014\u201cthe brightest fiber\u201d\u2014through a larger social and cultural history of the world in which he came of age, where it casts a lovely, personal glow over everything around it.", "That Talbot is a writer gifted enough to evoke not just images but their attendant music through her words will come as no surprise to anyone who\u2019s read her in", "", "or elsewhere. One of the things", "makes abundantly clear, though, is that she comes by her aesthetic sense naturally. Lyle, she writes, was \u201ca seeker after beauty, wherever it might be found,\u201d starting from his earliest days in small-town Nebraska. She is, too. From her childhood memories, her father\u2019s scrapbooks, his stories, and her own research and interviews, Talbot has woven a tale as romantic and vivid as any film could hope to be, while still seeing every bit of it plain. She is as clear-eyed about her father as she is about history\u2014no easy feat.", "Open on Pittsburgh, 1902, where Lyle was born to a mother who died of typhoid when he was just a few months old. His maternal grandmother, a widow, took him away from his father and back to Nebraska, where she raised him in her boarding house. (With no room of his own as a child, he bed-hopped among the Bohemian girls his grandmother employed, which, according to Talbot, left him with a few sentences of Czech and a lifelong love of women.) To seal the deal, she changed his name to her married name, Talbot. Her maiden name, which Warner Bros. would seize on with glee decades later when Lyle was one of their contract players, was", ". Talk about fate.", "In the intervening years between life at the Talbot Hotel and life on set, there were carnival acts (the names of which rise up from the page like emissaries from a dusty, lively forgotten world: MacKnight, the Hypnotic Funmaker; Mock Sad Alli; Tootsie Galvin), followed by roles of all sorts with touring theater groups. These companies would soon \u201cbe overwhelmed, first by radio and movies, then by television,\u201d Talbot writes, \u201cbut from the 1880s til the late 1920s, touring companies were what brought America its most reliable entertainment \u2026 its sense of make-believe.\u201d", "Luckily\u2014and luck was a big part of Lyle Talbot\u2019s life\u2014just as repertory theater was dying out, Lyle was summoned by telegram to what was fast becoming the bright new epicenter of make-believe. A Hollywood agent trolling for film stars to fill out Tinseltown\u2019s burgeoning ranks had seen him on the stage, noted, as one critic had it, that his \u201cgood looks are not wasted on the feminine portion of the audience,\u201d and asked for a screen test. Too broke to pay his train fare to California, Lyle borrowed it from the agent and set out for the coast.", "At Warner Bros., which signed him after that screen test, he suddenly found himself in boldface company. He was cast in pictures with Carole Lombard, with whom he also had one of many (many!) affairs; Bette Davis; Humphrey Bogart; Barbara Stanwyck (in Talbot\u2019s marvelous words, a woman \u201cwho seemed to be built for quick escapes and tight corners\u201d); James Cagney; Mae West; and countless other stars of the 1930s. They were all, it seems, utterly charmed by him, and he by them. As he recalled many years later about \u201cMiss West\u201d: \u201cShe\u2019d say, in that voice, \u2018Where are you gonna have lunch? I think I\u2019ll have a hamburger,\u2019 and she\u2019d sound, you know, like Mae West.\u201d", "", "He made nine movies in 1932 and another 12 in 1933, and often spent his days bicycling between lots with scripts for all the films he was in simultaneously in both the front and back baskets of his bike. In an interview, he described the circumstances of contract actors like himself: \u201cWe would work 14-, 15-hour days and then be called back the next morning. Saturday night they liked to work till midnight because you had Sunday off. The Catholic actors, Pat O\u2019Brien and Bill Gargan and Spencer Tracy, would joke that they\u2019d barely get home in time to make it to mass.\u201d The pace was unsustainable. And so, in 1933, Lyle joined together with 20 of his fellow actors, a not-yet-famous Boris Karloff among them, to found the Screen Actors Guild. Though it wouldn\u2019t be formally recognized for a few more years, by 1936 the actors\u2019 union had more than 5,000 members and had changed life in Hollywood forever.", "Meanwhile, Hollywood itself was busy transforming life in America. Though the Production Code, which went into effect in 1934, placed certain limits on what films could depict, it could do nothing to contain their influence. As going to the movies became less expensive (popcorn, considered too trashy for many years, made it to the movies around the same time Lyle did), and theaters transitioned from \u201cpalaces\u201d to simpler affairs where all the seats were the same price, audiences across the country began to take their cues about how to look, behave, and even feel from the silver screen. \u201cWhen Clark Gable took his shirt off in", "and revealed\u2014yowza\u2014no undershirt,\u201d Talbot notes, in one of the many meticulously researched then seamlessly deployed details that makes", "such a pleasure, \u201cit caused a national sensation and a serious dip in undershirt sales.\u201d Even divorce lost some of its stigma as fans followed the affairs and breakups of their favorite stars in gossip columns and newsletters published by fan clubs. (Joan Crawford was the honorary vice president of Lyle\u2019s.)", "\u201cLyle Talbot sat on the ringside with a new blonde,\u201d one wag wrote in the late \u201930s, \u201cbut I would say from the number of times he was called to the telephone that quite a few of the old blondes were trying to get in touch with him.\u201d All of these tidbits, of course, were an indicator of something far greater than just the state of their subjects\u2019 love lives. They were early evidence that the cult of personality, which now pervades not just entertainment but politics, business, and pretty much every other aspect of American life, was already in full force. Being a successful star was no longer a matter of simply acting. It was now a far more complex proposition that had as much, if not more, to do with what you wore and said and did off-screen as what you did on it. Actors were accountable not just to their studios but to their fans, who were no longer satisfied with the packaged bios and romances put out by publicity agents.", "Photo by Nina Subin", "In other words, the American public was learning nothing less than how to be \u201cmodern media consumers\u2014to be charmed by movie stars but not overwhelmed by them, to live in the world of celebrity without either turning their back on it or becoming unstrung by the fact that they themselves were not celebrities.\u201d Now, of course, we live in a time when the idea of someone accepting their own failure to be a celebrity seems quaint\u2014the Bravo channel alone is testament to that\u2014but Talbot\u2019s excursion into the ways the world of movies has affected the American psyche sheds considerable light on the origins of the fame-hungry culture we live in today. In addition, it animates the final years of Lyle\u2019s story, which might otherwise read like the rather worn plot of a Hollywood movie in which the handsome young actor never quite lives up to his early promise, nearly drinks himself to ruin, and is saved at the eleventh hour by the love of a good woman.", "The other thing that saves this story is the sheer affection with which it\u2019s told. Talbot is wise enough not to linger too long on the details of her family: the early death of her beloved mother, who was 26 years younger than her father and the only one who saw in him \u201cthe essential sweetness beneath the suavity, the hard drinking, and the playboy rep\u201d; the stories of her brothers\u2019 and sister\u2019s lives and her own childhood. But she offers a clutch of evocative sketches that give a marvelous sense of a world that feels as long gone to us as her father\u2019s childhood did to her\u2014California in the 1950s and \u201960s, before the glamour of Hollywood had tarnished and real small-town life was still possible close enough to commute to work on set.", "Along the way (just after a pit stop at Ed Wood\u2019s studios, where Lyle was briefly employed), we learn that the Talbot children grew up sheltered from the culture of Hollywood, albeit in Studio City, where their parents bought a modest house with the money from the sale of the Talbot Hotel back in Nebraska and then kept running with the salaries Lyle earned after his transition to television via movie serials (", "and", "among them). Even as a child, Talbot knew her peaceful life was touched by the delicious fantasy that is the stock-in-trade of any actor. She describes being trained very early on to answer the phone properly in case her father\u2019s agent was calling. \u201cOur job was to be ready, and to be ready was to be hopeful\u2014no matter how long the hiatus between jobs, even if the part was small, for a small part could be a cameo, and a cameo could be classy.\u201d", "", "Lyle Talbot is best known to many through his role on", "\u201cWe got to live our suburban idyll,\u201d his daughter writes, \u201cin large part because my father was enacting another one on TV.\u201d He performed in", "before his death in 1996.
