In stark contrast to the women\u2019s-magazine school of bedroom instruction (\u201cSurprise your man by waking him up with a blowjob twice a week!\u201d), Spiegel centers her guidance on finding personal and physical fulfillment. She opens with a quote from St. Augustine, of all people\u2014\u201cLove, and do what you will\u201d\u2014and a lengthy disclaimer stipulating she does not expect readers to agree with all of her recommendations, just to use her perspective as a jumping-off point for their own self-guided discoveries. \u201cImposing broad, uncritical rules on sex rankles me\u2014", ",\u201d she writes. \u201cI prefer to think,", "\u201d", "But fear not, horndogs: There are plenty of explicit step-by-steps in here, too, many of them neutral to gender, if not genital.

She\u2019s affirming, maternal even, in a way that feels comforting and somehow completely genuine. In one of her many discussions about sexual assault and consent, Spiegel presents a hypothetical encounter with a jerk who makes his partner feel guilty or unsure about her boundaries. \u201cThe idea of even the potential of that happening to you,\u201d Spiegel writes, \u201cmakes me want to mail a congressperson a stink bomb and yell obscene, hideous things at a beautiful phenomenon of nature\u2014ideally a canyon, but definitely a majestic, centuries-old sycamore,", ".\u201d I believe her.", "Honed during her tenure at", ", the online magazine for teen girls that\u2019s attracted", ", Spiegel\u2019s talent for writing thoughtful advice without condescending to her readers shines brightest when combining no-nonsense real talk with reassurances that almost nothing is as life-alteringly tragic as it seems in youth.

That\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, and if your partner makes you feel bad for it, \u201ckick them to the curb with no compunction.\u201d In fact, writes the highly qualified author, \u201cfucking up is how you go pro.\u201d", "Jordan Hemingway", "That\u2019s a lesson most teenagers could stand to learn before they first have sex\u2014and", "is brimming with them.

How can I get my boo to welcome the idea of a threesome and how should I behave as the third leg of another couple\u2019s triangle? What do we think about pubic hair?
