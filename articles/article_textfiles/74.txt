{"Body": ["Illustration by Sam Alden", ",\u00a0there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away.\u00a0Summer isn\u2019t all vacation; for those weeks you\u2019re stuck at a desk,", "staffers recommend books that took them places they\u2019ve never been.", "Amy Bloom\u2019s novel", "is one of my favorite books\u2014a tale of love and suffering, about an immigrant mother\u2019s search for her daughter, that for me is the Jewish version of", ". I\u2019d recommend it any summer, and this year Bloom has a new novel called", "that I also thoroughly enjoyed. It\u2019s a story of two half-sisters: Iris the sparkling starlet and Eva the mordant sidekick, and their downward spiral, against the backdrop of World War II, from Hollywood to Long Island. This book is about scheming and thievery, and how you can stitch together a self-identity out of all kinds of scrap cloth. It\u2019s rollicking, cinematic, and great fun.", "This is not the romantic South Pacific of Bali honeymoons. Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s troubling, beautiful novel follows a young doctor on a research expedition to an island whose people hold a secret to eternal life. From there, it examines scientific ethics large and small while riffing on the infamous case of", ", a Nobel Prize winner charged with molesting children he adopted from the South Pacific.", "The best thing I can say about this book is I read it a month ago, promptly reread it, and am still thinking about it. Published in 1959,", "tells a story of discovery, enlightenment, and hubris, set in a post-apocalyptic world. If you can get past the quirks of the novel\u2014like frequent use of Latin\u2014you\u2019ll find a thoughtful mediation on religion, science, and what can happen when technological progress is divorced from morality.", "Adam Levin\u2019s collection of stories took me inside the obsessive minds of people falling quickly and cruelly in love in Chicago. A legless, lesbian wunderkind finally gets the girl just in time\u00a0to meet her\u00a0untimely end, the author\u00a0of \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest love letter\u201d\u00a0never reaches his origami-loving\u00a0office crush, and a Skinnerian drug dealer falls for a girl who likes to get\u00a0punched in the face by strange men. Levin\u2019s\u00a0love stories are beautiful and thrilling and ultimately, doomed. In the summer at least, I prefer them that way.", "Summer\u2019s as good a time as any for bleak (fascinating, beautiful) dystopian fiction. In Ishiguro\u2019s sixth novel, a young woman\u2019s experience at a boarding school for \u201cspecial\u201d children takes on new meaning. The world he creates is steadily disquieting and scarily close to home.", "The myth of Baba Yaga, a feared old hag from Slavic folklore, informs every inch of this bizarre romp through contemporary Eastern Europe. An elderly mother\u2019s apartment in Zagreb, a broken-down Bulgarian seaside town, a circus-like spa resort in the Czech Republic, they\u2019re all backdrops for the narrator\u2019s exploration of what it means to be old\u2014and a woman\u2014in a world where being both at once can feel close to tragic.", "Yeah, I know: a young adult book about magic. But it\u2019s summer! The main character is a snide demon with a vicious sense of humor, and the books lay out a mechanism for magic that is self-consistent and logical within its own world. The books are funny, dark, and utterly transporting.", "Kingsolver masterfully weaves memoir and food writing for a breezy read that will leave you fantasizing about ditching your day job to grow your own food on a small farm. (Or maybe that\u2019s just me.) It also includes some fantastic recipes, which will make you grateful for all the fresh food of summer.", "A painstakingly\u00a0meticulous and vivid recreation of an underappreciated historical turning point\u2014Japan\u2019s reluctant opening to the outside world in the 18", "century\u2014a star-crossed love story, and a gripping adventure. If you liked Mitchell\u2019s", ", this one is even better.", "Getting sick of feeling hot and sticky while stuck in traffic? Can\u2019t stand the bugs that come out every dusk while you\u2019re trying to grill? Read Ian Frazier\u2019s delightful book about the endless steppes of Russia\u2019s largest, most remote region, and you\u2019ll never complain about your summer again. From the ramshackle roads to the towns with nothing to do or eat to the mosquitoes that descend from the sky every night \u201cas if shot from a fire hose,\u201d Frazier\u2019s Siberia sounds awful\u2014which is what makes his ability to convey why he loves Siberia so very much all the more impressive.", "I hope I\u2019m not cheating by choosing a place that doesn\u2019t exist, but this book is all about going to places you never thought existed. Though the book\u2019s been dubbed by some as", "for adults, it feels more accurate to think of it as", "", "adults. While the first part of the novel deals with a Hogwarts-like school, the rest is devoted to the angst of post-grad life and, well, discovering that a made-up Narnia-like land really exists. The final installment in the trilogy", ", so now\u2019s the perfect time to go to Fillory.", "In her novel about a woman who is repeatedly reincarnated, Kate Atkinson takes us to the same places\u2014the English countryside, London, Germany\u2014again and again. The story is really transportive, though, when Atkinson plants her protagonist, Ursula, into the middle of the Blitz. She conveys both the horror of war\u2014the panic, the smell of the bombs and fire, the randomness of who lives and who dies\u2014and the very British sang-froid response. I wouldn\u2019t want to visit, but you can see how people managed to live there.", "I loved this book, a series of short essays on everything ranging from dating a warlord to trying to check in with your grandma in Heaven. It\u2019s a twisty and wonderful journey into the strange and magical brain of a person who thinks at about five levels of weirdness simultaneously. It\u2019s hilarious and dark and mad and you\u2019ll find yourself quoting bits of it back to yourself forever after.", "It happens that Whitaker is a friend, but I would have picked up this book regardless. With his careful, welcoming prose, the author acts as a sort of docent to the opaque minds and hazy worlds of writers like Dickinson and Whitman who we now think of as \u201cgay.\u201d And later, once the \u201cGay Century\u201d is in full swing, he arranges knowing conversations with queer writers\u2014Stein, Baldwin, Holleran\u2014who more readily fit within the somewhat limited boundaries of the term. Whitaker\u2019s trustworthiness and arresting insight as a", "hold his literary s\u00e9ance together.", "A fantastical mystery novel set in an alternate Britain where all bow down to the cult of the written word, the book features incorrigible, magically enhanced villains, very human heroes, time-travelling parents, and dodos brought back from extinction to live a life of marshmallow-eating leisure. Fforde\u2019s whimsical stories belong to the Pratchett/Gaiman tradition and are a total delight.", "From Grecian beaches to bohemian London, a Kenyan safari, Mexico, the Midwest, Marrakech, and more, this novel bounds between exotic locales to tell the life of Mary, a stubbornly adventurous young woman, not just in men but also in places. Each spot is described with as much immersive detail as the last as Mary inhales the world around her in what little time she has.", "Intelligent characters, a riveting narrative and the\u00a0reversal of virtually\u00a0every convention in the genre\u00a0make this the best fantasy I have read to date.", "is a breezy read that\u00a0takes your imagination\u00a0on an epic ride, the momentum of which keeps\u00a0it on your mind long after you put it down.", "\u200b", "Dobbs has a novelist\u2019s heart and a historian\u2019s brain, capturing details that are by turn darkly comical and deeply unsettling. Human life has rarely seemed as puny and pointless as it did in 1945, when the horrors of World War II culminated with the atomic bombings of Japan. Dobbs takes us to the\u00a0rooms\u00a0where\u00a0decisions were made\u00a0that would determine the fate of millions, from Yalta to Potsdam, illustrating how the seeds planted there would sprout the century\u2019s next catastrophes.", "I\u2019m half sad and half relieved that my childhood bears no resemblance to this story, which is magical yet creepy at the same time. What if childhood nightmares were true, and there were \u201cspaces beneath the fences\u201d that hid entire magical worlds?", "If you haven\u2019t read Italo Calvino\u2019s", ", do. It will take you to many places you\u2019ve never been before because they don\u2019t exist. The story is one long conversation between explorer Marco Polo and emperor Kublai Khan, in which Polo describes all the cities he has seen. There\u2019s one that\u2019s just plumbing and women in bathtubs. There\u2019s one that\u2019s made out of string. My favorite is the one that\u2019s just the vision of a city you have before you go there, and the city itself writes over your prior mental image of it. It\u2019s also a book that is basically a poem, a taut but expansive little volume that will blow your mind best if you consume it in one sitting. Read it in one afternoon in a hammock with a glass of lemonade cooling your spare hand and a contemplative state of mind.", "Rachman\u2019s ingenious new novel\u00a0spans more than three decades and roughly twice that number of countries, taking us from Asia to America to Europe in a repeating cycle that is as delightful as it is disorienting. But perhaps as fitting for the question at hand, the book\u2019s best-crafted characters\u2014Tooley, a young woman unsure of her past, present, and future; Humphrey, an aging, ping-pong playing intellectual who may have kidnapped her for her own good\u2014use books to anchor\u00a0themselves\u00a0in places they\u2019ve never been as they remain on the move, by choice, by chance, and by necessity.", "It\u2019s 1739 and a cocky young soldier on his way to Madrid loses his way in the mountains of the Sierra Morena. He falls into a company of thieves, gypsies, cabbalists, geometers, ghosts, and knights, each of whom has a story to tell. In the gorgeous and bonkers knot of interweaving tales that coheres, sort of, over the next 66 days, the officer is seduced by two Moorish princesses (who may also be the dead brothers of Zoto the bandit), arm-wrestles the memory of his authoritarian father, and uncovers an international conspiracy of underground Muslim mystics. What I love about this collection of stories (all overlapping and echoing in mind-bending ways) is the pleasure it takes in polyphony\u2014lots of crazy people", "\u2014coupled with its use of silence and mystery. When you\u2019re done, you will want to go to Saragossa and look for more manuscripts.", "What better way to celebrate being chained to your desk than by reading about the horrors of vacation? You\u2019ve heard it said before, but David Foster Wallace\u2019s epic meditation on the excesses of luxury cruises really is one of the funniest essays ever written. (The rest of the collection isn\u2019t exactly dull, either.) As he journeys into the heart of darkness that lies at the deepest reaches of the hot-stone spa, he delivers the kind of escapism that will make you glad you never left home.", "I\u2019ve never hiked the Appalachian Trail, and I don\u2019t have to because Bill Bryson did it for me in this incomparable tale. He set out to walk all 2,100 miles accompanied by his former classmate Katz, an overweight, recovering addict who just before the journey starts declares, \u201cI gotta eat something every hour or so or I have, whadayacallit, seizures.\u201d This hilarious account will both transport you and make you so grateful for your cozy bed.", "---", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
