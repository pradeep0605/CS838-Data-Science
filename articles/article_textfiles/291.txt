{"Body": ["John Martz", "In December 1968, British member of Parliament Peter Bessell left a meeting with his friend and boss, Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe, praying Thorpe would change his mind about a plan he\u2019d just set in motion. The undesirable assignment wasn\u2019t a matter of political policy or election strategy; it was homicide. Thorpe wanted Bessell to attend a meeting with a would-be assassin to plan the murder of a troublesome ex-lover.", "June Thomas is a", "culture critic and editor of Outward,", "\u2019s LGBTQ section.", "The get-together comes one-third into John Preston\u2019s", ", and it marks the point at which Thorpe snaps into focus. Thereafter, he ceases to be a charming cad with an entertainingly reckless secret homosexual love life; instead he is revealed as a sociopathic manipulator willing to kill to keep his political ambitions alive.", "Until then, though, Preston presents Thorpe as the kind of colorful\u2014but not", "\u2014politician that still thrives in Britain. He was \u201cebullient and good-looking in a cadaverous sort of way\u201d; a \u201csmooth old Etonian with a distinctive taste in clothes\u201d who favored \u201ca cashmere overcoat with a velvet collar and, rather more eccentrically, a brown bowler hat.\u201d He also had a gift for retail politics\u2014although he had very little in common with his North Devon constituents, he had an \u201cextraordinary knack for remembering people\u2019s names and for making them feel that their problems were especially close to his heart.\u201d", "In one of their very first conversations, in 1965, Thorpe announced to Bessell that he was 80 percent gay, and although it was understood that he must remain closeted\u2014male homosexuality was still a criminal offense at the time, after all\u2014he behaved with a surprising lack of discretion, often sending incriminating letters and postcards to gay friends. It was this love of correspondence that started Thorpe down the path that eventually led to the criminal courts at the Old Bailey, where he found himself charged with conspiracy and incitement to murder in 1974.", "Back in 1960, when Princess Margaret, the queen\u2019s sister, announced her engagement to Anthony Armstrong-Jones, Thorpe had dashed off an arch postcard to his friend Brecht Van de Vater. \u201cWhat a pity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI rather hoped to marry one and seduce the other.\u201d When the card reached Van de Vater, he proudly showed it off to his handsome 19-year-old live-in assistant Norman Josiffe, along with 30 or so other letters from Thorpe, many written on House of Commons stationery. Later, the high-strung Josiffe grabbed the cache of correspondence and bolted from the house. A few weeks later, when he found himself homeless and directionless after a nervous breakdown, he went to Westminster to see Thorpe, who took him on an overnight visit to his mother\u2019s house\u2014called Stonewalls, ironically enough. After a peculiar formal dinner where the only food served was boiled eggs, Josiffe retired to his room, where Thorpe later buggered him. The next day, Thorpe told Josiffe where he could find a room to rent in London and gave him \u00a310. For some time afterward, they continued their sexual relationship.", "Fortunately, the hit men Jeremy Thorpe\u2019s friends engaged were utterly incompetent.", "Preston does a thorough job of following Josiffe\u2014who later changed his name to Norman Scott\u2014through a long string of fresh starts and disappointments. A pattern emerges of a delicate, damaged man who is forever walking away from the kinds of jobs\u2014usually working with horses, occasionally as a model\u2014that were available to men with no education, a history of mental illness, and a minor criminal record. Josiffe/Scott was clearly charming and attractive, because every time he stormed off, he always seemed to find someone willing to take him in. From Thorpe\u2019s point of view, though, Scott was a ticking time bomb, because everywhere he went, he told people\u2014his benefactors, priests, and even policemen\u2014about his sexual relationship with the man who by 1967 had become the leader of the Liberal Party. Thorpe was all too aware that Scott\u2019s meager possessions included a cache of his letters, now including a vaguely affectionate note sent by Thorpe to Scott that contained the line\u2014later subjected to rigorous public literary scrutiny\u2014\u201cBunnies can (and will) go to France.\u201d", "It was these letters\u2014and Scott\u2019s habit of blabbing about Thorpe to anyone who would listen\u2014that kept Scott on Thorpe\u2019s radar. Finally, after years of attempting to help himself by helping Scott\u2014making introductions, encouraging him to emigrate, having Bessell pay him a regular stipend\u2014Thorpe made the fateful decision to have Scott killed. Fortunately for Scott, the hit men Thorpe\u2019s friends engaged were utterly incompetent.", "Preston\u2019s description of the buffoonish, bungled murder attempt\u2014Scott survived, but his Great Dane, Rinka, was shot and killed\u2014and of Thorpe\u2019s Old Bailey \u201ctrial of the century\u201d are well-done. Nevertheless, the book\u2019s final third, in which Scott is further victimized by the legal system, makes for depressing reading. Preston refrains from editorializing, but it\u2019s impossible not to be appalled by the ambient homophobia of the period. Gay and bisexual men like Scott and Thorpe lived under daily threat of prosecution, were shut out of employment and subject to blackmail, could be denied entry into the United States, and were routinely described as filthy and depraved. Even after decriminalization in 1966, effeminate men like Scott were treated with contempt by the authorities, dismissed as hysterical and warped, and generally thought to be untrustworthy. To cite but one example, in one of the legal proceedings in which Scott was called as a witness, an eminent barrister attacked him, declaring that homosexuals are afflicted with \u201ca terrible propensity for malice.\u201d", "When asked \"How is the Queen?\" Princess Margaret (who Gore Vidal said was much too smart to be her position), replied \"Do you mean my mother, my sister, or my husband?\"", "", "", "", "", "American readers may wish to supplement", "with a selection of newspaper stories about the U.K.\u2019s current efforts to address what is known there as \u201c", ".\u201d For decades, high-profile predators got away with odious crimes on an almost unimaginable scale\u2014BBC stalwart", "and Liberal MP", ", both of whom make cameos in the book, were posthumously revealed to have abused hundreds of adults and children\u2014and Preston\u2019s narrative demonstrates, as those cases did, how members of the establishment closed ranks to protect their own. Senior policemen shut down inquiries, politicians prevented interviews, and favorable treatment was doled out. Forty-two years ago, the Old Bailey jury found Jeremy Thorpe not guilty. Now that we can see the baked-in biases of the time as well as the evidence, there\u2019s no doubt the verdict was a grave miscarriage of justice.", "In the midst of this awfulness, Preston\u2019s account of the fight to decriminalize male homosexuality in Britain is especially enjoyable. In this story the hero is Lord Arran, the quirky peer who moved the bill in the House of Lords. On the rare occasions that the eighth earl, Boofy to his friends, had previously spoken in the House, it was to advocate for the rights of badgers. He and his wife, a champion powerboat racer, allowed badgers to roam freely in their home in Hemel Hempstead, \u201cand always wore gumboots indoors to stop their ankles from being bitten.\u201d Nevertheless, Arran was driven by the memory of his gay elder brother, who had committed suicide days after succeeding to the title. Later, after a successful but bruising legislative battle, Arran was asked why homosexual law reform had passed while badgers were still unprotected. \u201cHe paused,\u201d Preston reports, \u201cand then said ruminatively, \u2018There are not many badgers in the House of Lords.\u2019 \u201d", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
