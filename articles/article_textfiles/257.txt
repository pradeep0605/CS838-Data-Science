In 2010, after the Haitian earthquake, he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes from the television, waiting for a hundred-foot wave to \u201cslop over car and grass and shrub: come on.\u201d \u201cThe inevitable,\u201d he writes in", "a book about his friendship with the late novelist Denise Gess, \u201cthis", "that wants to do us in: we can\u2019t watch the spectacle of it with any distance or detachment. We can\u2019t see that this wave is not about us.\u201d", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "How can something as annihilating as death\u2014something that snuffs out one-of-a-kind, irreplaceable flames\u2014be impersonal? How do you sweep together \u201ccar and grass and shrub\u201d (or, as an earlier writer phrased it, \u201c", "\u201d) without being in some sense \u201cabout\u201d the difference between a car and a shrub, or between Paul Lisicky and Denise Gess?", "Part elegy, part natural history, and all memoir,", "traces two of Lisicky\u2019s long-term relationships, the first with Gess, and the second with Lisicky\u2019s ex-husband, a poet he calls M. The Gess friendship, plunging between support and competition (writers!), takes center stage. It is a road paved with heartfelt correspondence yet pocked by silences, sore spots. Denise treasures Paul. Denise resents Paul for achieving a level of success she feels eluded her. Paul makes Denise a mix tape that sums up their relationship, on which all the songs \u201csay yes and yes and yes to love, in spite of the evidence against it: the compromises that should have never begun, the failures of communication, the disappointment surely to come.\u201d Denise gets cancer.", "Internet writing has made us connoisseurs of a certain kind of voice-y, jumpy, take-no-prisoners prose. Lisicky\u2019s style is different.", "The book jumps around in time, interpolating scenes from their early friendship (they are both teaching assistants in Rutgers\u2019 English department, both ascendant novelists) with descriptions of her decline and his mourning after her death. The structure can be disorienting, especially because Lisicky favors the present tense: Now he attends a prestigious writer\u2019s conference (\u201cEveryone around me seems to be having sex\u201d), now travels with interchangeable not-Denise friends (Katrina, Braunwyn, Maggie \u2026), now imagines flashpoint moments from the lives of Joni Mitchell and Vincent van Gogh, now drifts further and further away from M. But even when she vanishes for long stretches, Denise remains the memoir\u2019s occasion and central enigma.", "Delivering her eulogy, Lisicky remembers, \u201cI don\u2019t break down\u2014that\u2019s the last thing I want to do right now. I don\u2019t want the delivery to be about me.\u201d But it is. A few boilerplate lines of tribute (\u201ca ray of energy moving right into you\u201d) get us as close as we ever come to Denise the individual, the \u201csingle shining entity\u201d (to borrow one character\u2019s words about Walt Whitman). In part, that failure seems ontological and built into the elegiac form. Denise, Lisicky insists, equals multiple Denises, \u201cfractured and dazzling,\u201d un-pin-down-able by a single representation. But her elusiveness is also a symptom of the way Lisicky uses her as a lens through which to see himself.", "is a work of bleeding boundaries. Lisicky activates this theme, early on, with a quote from J.D. Salinger, who along with Whitman forms part of the text\u2019s imaginative infrastructure. (Glass-ian images of trapdoors and riffs on Holden Caulfield\u2019s frozen pond appear throughout.) In this sentence, from", ", a character recalls: \u201cSeymour once said to me\u2014in a crosstown bus, of all places\u2014that all legitimate religious study", "lead to unlearning the differences, the illusory differences, between boys and girls, animals and stones, day and night, heat and cold.\u201d Lisicky reflects that dissolving such lines\u2014or thinking about dissolving them as your bus route collapses the border between the east side and the west side\u2014is \u201cgood,\u201d and that\u2019s how he writes: by letting his emotions spill into the natural world, into involved and sensual descriptions of environmental catastrophe. Like a Discovery Channel show narrated by Supreme Leader Snoke, he relives the Deepwater Horizon oil leak, the eruption of Mount St. Helens, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, explosions, and Sept. 11. Denise grows frailer and M finds a new lover; meanwhile, Lisicky displaces his feelings about life\u2019s precariousness onto a televised demolition, the house coming down \u201cas a person would, balancing there for a minute, stricken.\u201d", "And it is stunningly done. \u201cThe last time I played the tearless role was at our wedding,\u201d Lisicky writes, \u201cin a salt marsh on Cape Cod \u2026 when I read [M.] a passage from", "\u201d Get it? The author does not weep, but he stands in a salt marsh, which weeps for him. And he uses Whitman\u2019s song of", "to articulate his own identity, to meld and fuse it to the soul of another man. As these gay selves melt together and pour into the landscape, you wonder whether it is the sense of taboo around their desires that first forced them to project their inner lives outward. (Have gay writers always been \u201ccoming out\u201d this way?) Whitman did it: One passage in", "lingers over his description of grass as \u201cthe unkempt hair of graves,\u201d an especially throat-squeezing citation in a book about a cancer patient.", "Image by Star Black", "Lisicky, an Iowa M.F.A. who\u2019s held a number of tony fellowships and residencies (along the way collecting shimmery insider friendships for Gess to envy), has passed through America\u2019s official creative writing gullet. He crafts prose like someone who workshops crafted prose for a living, which means he\u2019s elegant, precise, and sensitive. (One highlight: an amazing passage after he breaks up with M., \u201cMy furnace. My doorway. My duty. My desert. My daystar.\u201d) But page-by-page, Lisicky\u2019s style relies less on extravagant language than on extravagant", ": a maximal use of complexity. Even putting aside all the echoes and tropes, his sentences contain unusually nuanced shades of thought and meaning, as when he says that a character looks like \u201cshe\u2019s been places, if not literal places.\u201d Or when chemo scrambles Denise\u2019s brain until her stream of consciousness breaks apart, so that \u201ceach thought is another roll of the dice.\u201d Or when he fights with M: \u201cI feel myself moving away from him. I feel my body moving out through the open window, up through the trees \u2026 I am aware that my crying can probably be heard outside the window. I don\u2019t know why I should be concerned about the sound of my crying out the window, but there it is.\u201d", "The tearless groom weeps", ", as his relationship founders. The sound spills into the wider world, where the neighbors can hear and the noise stops belonging only to him. This is Lisicky revealing the loss that can follow a shattered boundary. M. is to Paul, who floats out the window moments before the crying does, as Paul is to his own tears. Losing M. is like losing himself.", "It\u2019s fascinating\u2014given how exquisitely worked and wrought this memoir is\u2014when Lisicky takes a second to chafe at editors\u2019 response to his unpublished novel. \u201cThe rejections are appreciative, respectful. They say the writing is beautiful\u2014and yet? \u2018Quiet\u2019 is the word that\u2019s most often used,\u201d he reports.", "seems right. It reminds me that Internet writing has made us connoisseurs of a certain kind of voice-y, jumpy, take-no-prisoners prose. I found Lisicky\u2019s style different, and delightful. What bothered me more was the way his permeable margins gave the book a sweat sheen of self-absorption, which is itself a predictably basic plaint about memoir. Yet when every natural disaster represents an aspect of your psyche, and characters exist to teach you truths about yourself, it\u2019s hard to avoid. After pages of stirring, careful introspection, for example, Lisicky concludes with a line that\u2019s meant to explode with revelation: \u201cA thought leans into me like a shoulder I can\u2019t see: my life would be larger if I could hold the dark side of Denise alongside the bright.\u201d Yes but\u2014Denise is dying, so is the size of his life really the point here?", "Yet to suggest that Lisicky isn\u2019t aware of, and torturing himself over, elegy\u2019s competing impulses is to undersell the book\u2019s wisdom. \u201cShapely paragraphs, consoling thoughts\u2014no,\u201d he chides himself at one point. \u201cNone of that belongs in this space.\u201d At the same time, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be all over the place.\u201d Might that be the hard-won realization of", "? That discipline, the drawing of boundaries and the practice of", ", is as much a part of grief as loosening your hair to the wind? With my favorite line in the book, Lisicky fences a border instead of voiding it, and he conjures Denise\u2019s craft instead of demonstrating his own. \u201cThat smile on her face!\u201d he remembers, marveling at the memory of his friend. \u201cA smile that could turn diamonds to black powder, which sounds more like her description than mine.\u201d", "---", "by Paul Lisicky.
