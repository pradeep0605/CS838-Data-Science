{"Body": ["Illustration by Emily Carroll", "It\u2019s obligatory: Every generation of adults must panic about kids and sex. In their new book", ", Joel Best and Kathleen Bogle begin with quaint, bygone examples: a 1920s", "story in which mothers complained about \u201cpetting parties\u201d and a 1950s book that warned girls against the \u201cheavy necking\u201d involved in going steady. More recently, parental and societal alarms have sounded over \u201crainbow parties,\u201d in which girls supposedly leave different rings of lipsticks, in different shades, around the penises of boys they have\u2014yuck, in my own moment of parental squeamishness, I refuse to finish that sentence. Another color-coded modern-day scare: \u201csex bracelets,\u201d in which the color of the bracelet is reported to stand for the act performed.", "is a staff writer at the", "and the author of", ".", "Best and Bogle dissect both of these trends and convincingly determine that they are legends\u2014stories that spread even though few kids have actually gone to a sex party or had sex based on the color of a bracelet. It\u2019s not that every report of a girl giving oral sex to a bunch of hockey players is false. It\u2019s that the degree to which this is happening is", ". Why do we so readily believe the tall tales? That part is easy. As Best and Bogle observe, rainbow parties and sex bracelets feed our parental obsession with \u201cthreats to children\u2019s innocence.\u201d For conservatives, they\u2019re grist for the mill of abstinence-based sex education and chastity pledges. For liberals, they\u2019re cause for worrying about the degradation of girls in a sexist culture.", "With the whys out of the way, Best and Bogle focus on the channels through which these hyped-up legends spread. One of their conclusions may sound counterintuitive, but for me, it resonates: Don\u2019t blame the Internet. Blame morning television.", "The alarmism breeds, and has repercussions. It creates a misleading picture of kids\u2019 lives and obscures the real risks.", "The villains of this book are Oprah, Diane Sawyer, Joe Scarborough, and Matt Lauer, who, Best and Bogle demonstrate, give credence and airtime to segments based on thirdhand accounts of what someone else\u2019s kid or friend was doing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to turn now to a disturbing new trend in the news among young girls. Very young girls,\u201d Sawyer said on", ", in a 2004 segment on the sex bracelets. \u201cChildren out of control, experimenting with sex before they reach their teens,\u201d Scarborough said on his show the previous year. (He also claimed, \u201cWe hear stories every week.\u201d) Best and Bogle point out that one fifth-grade girl named Megan appeared on three different shows after being expelled from Catholic school for selling jelly bracelets. On air, she said banal things like, \u201cI just collect the colors.\u201d In fact, Best and Bogle couldn\u2019t find a single instance, reading through TV transcripts, of an interview with a student or parent or school official who identified a real rainbow party or sex conspiracy linked to the bracelets. To make the leap, the shows traded in insinuation. During her", "appearance, Megan mentioned sixth graders French kissing, and Sawyer jumped in with \u201cSo they were", "the French kiss in her school.\u201d", "Right\u2014just like some kids French kissed in sixth grade at my school, and maybe yours, too. And yet, on these shows, journalists, parents, school board members, and teachers express horror-filled certainty that middle school kids today are thinking and doing things their own generations would never have imagined. The logic goes like this: The culture is more sexualized\u2014we see it all around us. So kids (other people\u2019s kids) must be more sexualized, too. \u201cEven 10 and 11-year-olds, they knew how to say, \u2018homework\u2019s done,\u2019 and then they knew how to have an orgy,\u201d said", "writer Michelle Buford, appearing on", "in 2003.", "Print media offered better, less credulous coverage. (Best and Bogle also give", "a shout out for the lampoonery of a segment on the \u201cterrifying teenage trend\u201d of \u201c", ".\u201d) Another voice of media reason in the book is", "editor Atoosa Rubenstein, who told CNN that she\u2019d been at her job for a long time, and she\u2019d never heard of a girl actually attending a rainbow party. \u201cThe numbers prove that girls today are actually starting to go toward modesty in their own lives,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe number of virgins is up \u2026 The pregnancy rates are down.\u201d", "Rubenstein, who has since left", ", had her facts straight. The most important chapter in this short book is the last one, in which Best and Bogle dig into the numbers. From 1988 to 2010, they report, the percentage of sexually active girls, ages 15 to 19, dropped from 51 percent to 43 percent; the rate for boys fell from 60 percent to 42 percent. In 2011, only 6.2 percent of kids reported having sex for the first time before age 13, down from 10.2 percent 20 years earlier. Kids today don\u2019t have more sexual partners than their parents did, on average\u2014they have slightly fewer.", "On social media sites, some parents show that they get it. Alongside teens pooh-poohing these so-called trends, they make the case against panic. I liked the line of inquiry of this skeptical commenter on rainbow parties: \u201cHow do the girls know what color lipstick to wear? Is there a committee? ... Can 7 High School girls really agree on anything?\u201d The book includes two graphs that track online comments on ROYGBIV blow jobs and sex bracelets, comparing them to amped-up media coverage. \u201cIt seems telling that we cannot find any informal\u2014that is, outside traditional media\u2014mentions of rainbow parties until after the media\u2019s coverage began,\u201d Best and Bogle write. They also point out that commenters who believe in the legends tend to point to someone else\u2019s kids, at some other school, or even in some other state, as the source of the trouble.", "Courtesy of Kathleen Bogle.", "Still, the alarmism breeds, and has repercussions. It creates a misleading picture of kids\u2019 lives and obscures the real issues of sexuality facing American teens. While the overall teen birthrate has declined, too many black and Hispanic girls are still getting pregnant. Data from 2011 shows that teenagers of color are more likely than white kids to have had sex before age 13 and to have had four or more partners. Best and Bogle rightly argue that the TV shows do a disservice, fueling \u201cthe fears of white, middle-class parents that their kids are engaging in unprecedented sexual promiscuity\u201d while ignoring \u201creal class differences in sexual behavior, which are connected to poverty, educational opportunities, and other complex factors that the news media, particularly television, often want to avoid.\u201d", "Then there\u2019s the response to sexting, the third phenomenon this book covers. This one isn\u2019t a legend:", ". When one kid disseminates another one\u2019s photo, especially to humiliate or take revenge, that\u2019s wrong and harmful. Best and Bogle argue, however, that felony charges for sexting are often an overreaction. The sexting situation that Pew found to be most common\u2014\u201cone teen sending a sexually provocative self-image to his or her boyfriend or girlfriend\u201d\u2014is different from the worst-case, thankfully rare scenario of kids maliciously spreading around someone else\u2019s image.", "strengthened my conviction that we should", "", ".", "Courtesy of Joel Best", "The happiest takeaway from this book, to me, is that \u201cteen sex occurs, on the whole, within the context of romantic relationships.\u201d Best and Bogle base this conclusion on the responses of boys as well as girls. Bogle\u2019s 2008 book,", ", was about the casual sex scene in college, where she found that \u201c", ". There\u2019s plenty of slut-shaming to deplore among high school and middle school students, too.

I\u2019d like to tell my 14-year-old son that the point of sex is to feel good about yourself, which happens when the other person feels good about herself or himself, too, and it\u2019s all a whole lot more likely if you both really care about each other. My son seems to have less than zero interest in discussing this with me. But earlier this summer, our entire family watched the", ".
