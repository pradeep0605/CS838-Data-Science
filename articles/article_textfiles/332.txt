Eggers denies having read Katherine Losse\u2019s 2012 memoir of her time at Facebook,", ", despite the many similar contours between his book and hers: Young woman takes a job at a social-networking company answering user questions, rises through the ranks, is at times put on public display without her clear consent, grapples with hard questions about privacy and information-sharing, and ultimately finds the company\u2019s \u201ccause\u201d has swallowed her life and redefined her sense of self and other.

The reader is told that \u201cTruYou changed the internet, in toto, within a year,\u201d that \u201cthe TruYou wave was tidal and crushed all meaningful opposition,\u201d that it was \u201cthe force that subsumed Facebook, Twitter, Google\u201d\u2014and Eggers raises the stakes considerably in invoking that threesome, signaling to the reader that his satire is rooted in reality. (Steve Jobs is name-checked, too.) But", "did TruYou subsume Facebook and Google, and so quickly?", "The answer, Eggers implies\u2014and here\u2019s the seed of his plot and his critique\u2014is that TruYou demands actual names, total transparency. It turns out that the free-market solution to monopolizing the Internet is simply to make people use their real names for all online activity. Notably, Facebook tried something akin to TruYou in 2007 with Facebook Beacon, which,", ", took \u201ca far more transparent and personal approach\u201d to online tracking. It was a fiasco, resulting in complaints, a class-action suit, and the shutdown of Beacon in 2009. TruYou, somehow, is the opposite of a fiasco. Users love the streamlined experience and precision-targeted marketing. Plus, \u201covernight, all comment boards became civil, all posters held accountable,\u201d Eggers writes. \u201cThe trolls, who had more or less taken over the Internet, were driven back into the darkness.\u201d Back, stupid trolls!

But when you\u2019re reading a novel about the Internet by a writer who doesn\u2019t seem clear on what an operating system is or who thinks that a unified ID-and-payment system could extinguish all trolls, everything starts looking like a nit to pick. Does the Circle have its own OS? Its own browsers? How much hardware does it make? If it\u2019s constantly backing up every conceivable shred of its users\u2019 data\u2014if that\u2019s its fundamental mission\u2014where are its data centers?

With every day within the Circle, her attention is further divided among more and more screens, networks, and rankings. She must race to keep up with a never-ending stream of user questions, monitor the scores users give her (and grade-grub to improve them), participate in multiple social networks (Zing is basically Twitter, and \u201czing\u201d is a verb) and a litany of work-related social events, and obsess over her \u201cParticipation Rank,\u201d a kind of intracompany Klout score.
