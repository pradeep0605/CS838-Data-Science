{"Body": ["Illustration by Fumio Obata", "Kim Kardashian has been taking selfies since 1984. That was the year she first immortalized her own face in an admiring close-up\u2014round cheeks filling the frame, flash shining in her toddler eyes like a premonition. Some other baby Kardashian wails beside her, unmoved by the photo op, but Kim confronts the camera head-on. Her little mouth curves upward and destiny clicks into place.", "Laura Bennett is", "s culture editor overseeing the", "and television coverage.", "That image is the first entry in", ", Kim Kardashian West\u2019s new book of selfies. To be clear: This book consists entirely of selfies. That\u2019s 445 pages of them, arranged chronologically over three decades, a flipbook of thickening makeup and increasingly complicated hairdos. Over time, clubbing nights with Paris Hilton fade into engagement ring snaps; tiny Jenners evolve into leggy teens; one day North pops into the frame, simply the newest cameo in her mother\u2019s selfied life.", "is an insane project, a document of mind-blowing vanity and deranged perseverance. It\u2019s also riveting. I can\u2019t recommend it enough.", "It\u2019s easy to see why the selfie has become a cultural punch line. There\u2019s no better emblem of a whole generation\u2019s ills as projected by previous generations, no better totem of the self-absorbed screen zombies conjured in", "trend stories with headlines like \u201c", "\u201d and \u201c", "\u201d And if the selfie has a mascot, it\u2019s Kim Kardashian. Not just because she, judging by her output, is never not in the process of photographing herself\u2014but also because the selfie as a medium seems tailor-made for her own diligently cultivated brand.", "Unlike the many other gussied-up ing\u00e9nues who rose through the ranks of reality TV, Kim Kardashian\u2019s public image has always been a uniquely nimble balancing act. She manages to project a whole mess of seemingly incompatible traits: wholesome (family values) and scandalous (sex tapes), self-aware (jokes about her own materialism) and oblivious (carrying a Herm\u00e8s bag painted by her 1-year-old child), highbrow (", "covers) and gauche (photo shoots of her butt). Even before Kanye West helped grease her entry into pop culture\u2019s inner sanctum, she\u2019d somehow cemented an image as the most grounded of reality TV\u2019s leading ladies, the usual whiff of desperation counterbalanced with more apparent ownership of her song-and-dance.", "Photos by Kim Kardashian courtesy Rizzoli.", "But if this act can often seem gaudy and tone-deaf, her tackiness has never seemed less like indiscretion and more like a savvy self-differentiator than it does in", ". This book", "needless to say, does not have grand literary ambitions. It has no literary ambitions at all. It barely has words. The words it does contain are so aggressively repetitive that they feel like a true feat of editorial indifference. \u201cBikini selfies are my favorite,\u201d Kim remarks in one caption. \u201cBikini selfies are my fave,\u201d she later adds. She is not coy with her themes. \u201cThe pictures in this book bring back so many memories,\u201d she writes. Then: \u201cI love that we have these memories.\u201d Also: \u201cThese pics bring back so many memories.\u201d Not to mention: \u201cI love doing photo shoots and having memories.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen someone make so little effort to be interesting\u2014a banality so confident it feels like a revelation. \u201cI love,\u201d she writes at one point, \u201cthat I have thousands of pics.\u201d", "Through her shapeshifting selfies, she records milestones like birthdays and pregnancies and births. She also records lesser milestones like \u201cAbout to do", ".\u201d Some selfies are fascinating for their lack of context, like the picture of Kim in a construction hat captioned only: \u201cI was in Africa in a diamond mine.\u201d Some feature perfect comic timing, like the page that includes a photo of Kim behind the wheel of a car and the words, \u201cI took a selfie at a red light while driving. I think that\u2019s illegal now.\u201d", "What makes", "so crazily engrossing is the way it breaks down, image by nearly identical image, the precise, self-determined path of Kim Kardashian\u2019s rise from socialite to household name\u2014and the way that over the course of hundreds of consecutive selfies, the evolution of her public and private selves gets fully entangled. It\u2019s never quite clear whether she is mugging for herself or her husband or her kid or knowingly mugging for us, the consumers of the beautiful Rizzoli art book she always knew she\u2019d produce.", "comes to feel almost like a modern parable for the anyone-can-be-famous age. If you have ever entertained the thought that Kardashian selfies were mere judgment lapses, or the idle fruit of late-night boredom, the total intentionality on display in this book is like a punch to the gut. Here is a woman who presciently hoarded thousands of pictures of her own pouty mien, anticipating the day when some publisher would pay her to compile them. Clearly this is someone who has spent her life devising elaborate ways to get herself seen, and it\u2019s mesmerizing to see the full arc of her self-actualization so vividly on display.", "If there is a supporting character in", ", it is makeup. \u201cI can look at any photo of myself and can tell who did my hair and makeup, where I was and who I was with,\u201d Kim says. (The requisite \u201cno makeup selfies\u201d she includes feel about as out of place here as a business suit at a drag show.) In 2008, she met Mario Dedivanovic, who would become her lifelong makeup artist, and she captions a photo of his disembodied hands applying lip-liner to her mouth: \u201cAfter this photo shoot he took me makeup shopping because I loved how I looked and how that made me feel.\u201d", "This is the source of much of", "\u2019s appeal: Yes, it is obsessed with surfaces, and it is bracingly unapologetic about that obsession. Kim doesn\u2019t even pretend to view the world as more than a scenic backdrop for her own embellished face. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever taken as many selfies as I did in Thailand. It\u2019s one of the prettiest places I\u2019ve ever traveled to!\u201d she tells us, posing before a sliver of Thailand mostly obscured by her hair. She makes zero effort to encourage you to like or identify with her; she casually assumes a certain commonality of caste. \u201cHelicopter ride from the Hamptons to the city,\u201d she writes, or \u201cThis amazing chateau had an entire room that was an aquarium.\u201d One highlight is a vignette about the time she put on a green Lanvin dress in a restaurant bathroom during a dinner with Kanye. Why? \u201cThere were so many paparazzi that showed up while we were eating. I wanted to change into a dope new look.\u201d", "The promise of Kanye looms over", "long before he arrives, helping to propel the book\u2019s nonexistent plot. His first mention is in the caption on a car-backseat selfie from 2011: \u201cI just got this Fendi coat and was in New York. I was in a taxi and took this selfie to actually send to Kanye to see if he liked my new coat. He did!\u201d A", "concert gets captioned #wifelife. There\u2019s also a mirror pic, sexily captioned \u201cMeet me in the bathroom\u2026\u201d Kim preens while Kanye gives the camera the dead-eyed Kanye stare. It\u2019s a selfie that perfectly captures one of the main reasons they make such a compelling pair: the way their egos seem like exact inverses of each other. If Kanye is restlessly reaching for ever-higher planes of greatness, Kim could not seem more existentially secure. While he worries over his place in the pantheon, she is firmly anchored in the here-and-now, cherishing the look of her cheekbones in the light.", "So the boldest thing about", "is not just that she\u2019s inviting you to look at her several hundred times over\u2014it\u2019s that she\u2019s forcing you to look at her the exact way she wants you to, from the exact angle, in the exact lighting of her choosing. You could call", "a sneakily feminist document, an act of reclamation by one of the world\u2019s most photographed women. But that would be ridiculous. Forget the male gaze, or even the female gaze\u2014the only gaze that matters here is Kim Kardashian\u2019s, directed squarely at herself, Kim Kardashian looking at Kim Kardashian back and forth until the end of time. Selfies may be generally regarded as badges of insecurity, but here they seem like the opposite: evidence of real, uncomplicated self-love.", "Who will buy this book? Surely no one. But halfway through comes a development that may serve as incentive to some\u2014several pages of nude photos, astonishing mostly for the exceptional evenness of her tan. This includes a photo released during the", ", which she captions, \u201cI wasn\u2019t intending to put these in the book but I saw them online during the iCloud hack. I\u2019m not mad at them. Lol.\u201d", "The very last selfie in", "is a shot of Kim and Kanye\u2019s entwined hands. \u201cI\u2019m officially Mrs. West,\u201d the caption says.

The intended message may be that Kim is renouncing", "-ness in favor of partnership, that marital sacrifice means photographing merely her hands instead of her cleavage and face. But the more emphatic message is that she\u2019s won. It feels like a natural endpoint for a book charting the 2-D narrative of Kim Kardashian\u2019s ambition: from less famous to more famous, from reality starlet to #wifelife, from dope new look to dope new look.", "---", "by Kim Kardashian West.
