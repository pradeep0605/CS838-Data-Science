Many of his songs are short and fast-paced, but most of all they tend to focus on the flash of a moment when something changes or a revelation falls into place; they shine a spotlight on that ineffable sensation and then short out before it has a chance to fade. So, even if they are, like all the new and old thinking, about loss, it is most often in the mode of trauma\u2014of the sudden blow that renders the lost object or the lost self unreachable, and fixes attention on the shape of its absence.", "Loss is a human constant, but for each person it occurs each time as if it were the first. When your house catches fire, it does not matter how many buildings have burned before. That is what Mountain Goats songs are mainly about, whether tender or noisy or ridiculous.", "When critics and journalists discuss Darnielle\u2019s new, first full-length novel,", ", which was just", ", they often point out the", "aspect of his songwriting. But Mountain Goats songs are as much incantation as narrative\u2014they imply the advent of the trauma with declarations and appeals to dead gods, which deny it or try (futilely) to ward it off. \u201cWhen I receive the blessing I\u2019ve got coming,\u201d Darnielle crows in 2004\u2019s \u201c", ",\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to raise an ice-cold glass of water/ and toast the living and the dead/ who\u2019ve gone before me, and my head/ will throb like an old wound reopening.\u201d Images of black ritual, fantasy, and escape stake an outline around unspeakable realities.", "Entertainments, no matter how apparently nihilistic, are actually lifelines that give people a place to put their pain.", "is likewise quite explicitly about living with trauma, or refusing to, and the transformative powers of all those choices. But with 200 pages rather than three minutes to fill, Darnielle is led to explore trauma\u2019s consequences, day to day and over time, far more finely. As a result the book is not the kind of rallying cry or dark comfort that Mountain Goats fans are used to, but a complex meditation\u2014partially about the potential costs of those very cries and comforts. Like Darnielle\u2019s songwriting, the prose is often cryptic and then stunningly clear, microscopically specific and then audaciously grand. The words soothe for sentences at a time, then strike with blunt force:", "In Chapter 7: \u201cNormal adult shopping is something I will never actually do, because it\u2019s no more possible for me to go shopping like normal adults do than it is for a man with no legs to wake up one day and walk. I can\u2019t miss shopping like you\u2019d miss things you once had. I miss it in a different way. I miss it like you would miss a train.\u201d", "In Chapter 10: \u201cThere was a small, strange moment during which I had the feeling that someone was filming me. \u2026 It is a terrible thing to feel trapped within a movie whose plot twists are senseless. This is why people cry at the movies: because everybody\u2019s doomed.\u201d", "(Darnielle\u2019s own urgent", "of the book, by the way, is not to be missed.)", "The reader learns early on that the narrator, Sean Phillips, was horribly disfigured in an unspecified \u201caccident\u201d as a teenager, a decade or more ago. At first that vagueness is frustrating, making the first couple of chapters a bit laborious to read. Then it becomes clear that the novel is going to track its way back toward that event, seeking to explain it\u2014or perhaps more accurately to fail to do so, in great detail, as if penetrating ever deeper into a maze that has no center.", "This is also the nature of the game Sean has invented, a retro role-playing adventure called Trace Italian. It too enters the story as a kind of oneiric presence that only gradually reveals itself as an actual thing; indeed, this game, in which players participate by snail mail, paying a monthly fee to post their next move to Sean\u2019s P.O. box, is Sean\u2019s prime source of income. This makes it both more banal and more amazing, until we discover that it\u2019s also had unintended real-world effects for at least two of its adolescent participants. Whether Sean is legally or morally culpable for what\u2019s happened is a central issue, leading to the question of his own fate, and who, if anyone, is to blame.", "Adolescents in crisis are a touchstone of Darnielle\u2019s empathic imagination. His only previous published long prose work\u2014", ", an essay-cum-novella on Black Sabbath in the", "\u2014was about a teen boy confined to an institution pleading with the doctors to give his heavy-metal tapes back. Many of his songs (e.g. \u201c", "\u201d) portray similar characters. Before he became a full-time musician, Darnielle gained up-close experience with such troubled kids as a psychiatric nurse. (The new novel is great on the maddening tedium of hospitals, treatment, and recovery.)

And when you are a performer", ", as the California-born, North Carolina\u2013based Darnielle has become as he\u2019s progressed from home taper in the 1990s to touring indie star today, you have your fans to reinforce for you that those ordeals continue always and everywhere.", "Sean has the same experience with his letter-writing gamers, who scrawl bits of their lives into the margins of their moves, sometimes for company and sometimes, as with one boy, involuntarily, \u201cthe parts he hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself from mentioning, the pieces of himself that flew from him naturally like sparks from a torch.\u201d Sean also learns, in spades, due to the grotesqueness of his face, what it\u2019s like to be conspicuous and stared at\u2014which Darnielle/Sean directly compares at one point to being famous. Both the Trace Italian storyline and the emerging details of how Sean\u2019s injury might link to his own teen immersion in fan culture (particularly of", "novels and comics) raise the problem of an artist\u2019s responsibility for his fans\u2019 potential misinterpretations and wild misuses of the work.", "The novel\u2019s title refers to the kind of controversy that usually raises that problem\u2014in this case, supposed satanic messages concealed on rock records. One song by 1970s Christian rocker Larry Norman", "which\u2014 as Darnielle has Sean note\u2014 seems like a pretty obscure thought for the devil to go to such lengths to deliver. The idea of playing songs in reverse parallels the structure of Darnielle\u2019s novel, but it also reminds us how metal and goth bands, Dungeons & Dragons, horror movies, and other works of art have been indicted for their supposed roles in teen suicides, murders, and even mass killings.", "Courtesy of Lalitree Darnielle", "In everyday life, Darnielle would be the first to decry that kind of crude heuristic and to say that these entertainments, no matter how apparently nihilistic or aggressive, are actually lifelines that give people a place to put their pain, and a sense that they are not alone with it.

Yet with a novel\u2019s ability to play every side of a drama, without having to endorse a final answer, in", "Darnielle is able to dig into an artist\u2019s forbidden fears and doubts, even delusions of potency: What if the incantation does not always ward off evil but sometimes, unintentionally, summons it? What if it gives the hidden beast (the wolf?) meat to feed on? What if that happens and the artist never even hears about it?", "In enjoying morbid art, it is necessary that danger feel present. It\u2019s the shimmer of the blurred boundary that\u2019s the lure, despite liberal platitudes that the free play of fantasy is wholesomely inconsequential. After all it\u2019s liberal platitudes, the dry coercion of common sense, that those thrillingly unhealthy fantasies are meant to counter.
