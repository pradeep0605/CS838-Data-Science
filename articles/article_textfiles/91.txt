His confession is good strategy, an attempt to assure the unwashed masses that the author is unpretentious and beer-summit\u2013able, never mind his critically acclaimed fiction and poetic calling.

Poetry haters aren\u2019t rubes; they\u2019re idealists. The genre\u2019s problem is bound up in its soaring ambition, its intent to render the intensely personal tones of a writer\u2019s inner life somehow intelligible and world-transfiguring to all. Poetry\u2014less a set of practices than a sheaf of impossible demands\u2014inspires", "and", "because, even at its best, it powerfully envisions a threshold it can\u2019t quite clear. Nothing can.

For one thing, like a twitchy friend whose charming self-deprecations mask her insecurity, verse loves to take its own failure as its subject. Keats, famed for otherworldly, musical lines, reminds us that \u201cHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard/ are sweeter.\u201d Emily Dickinson prefers to \u201cdwell in Possibility,\u201d in a virtual house made of windows and doors, rather than the concrete hut of the actual. Her dashes\u2014\u201cvectors of implication,\u201d Lerner calls them\u2014mark the limits of language, zones of submerged meaning \u201cwhere no words will do.\u201d (I hear", "here, too: \u201cMost writers approach a new story like a boxer circling the ring\u2014with a certain reluctance to engage and break the spell of", ".\u201d)", "Matt Lerner", "Then there is Whitman, who in paradoxical runs like \u201cI am the poet of the slaves, and of the masters of the slaves\u201d reveals the aching impossibility of his artistic project. He cannot dissolve human \u201cviolence and difference,\u201d especially by retreating into his specific perceptions; he can only serve as \u201ca placeholder for democratic personhood,\u201d one that \u201ccannot become actual without becoming exclusive.\u201d Claudia Rankine, serving up prosy blocks of deadened description, like the transcript of a story told by a PTSD patient, makes us feel the \u201cunavailability of traditional lyric categories; the instruction to read her writing as poetry\u2014and especially as lyric poetry\u2014catalyzes an experience of their loss, like a sensation in a phantom limb.\u201d", "I reject the premise that Lerner actually dislikes poetry.", "It\u2019s engaging stuff, and superbly written, with a kind of soft-shoeing \u00e9lan that wants to project humility but also delight. (Here is Lerner meshing learning with wry diffidence: \u201cA feeble shadow of an original conception sounds like Plato, although Plato didn\u2019t think a poet could really conceive of much.\u201d) You might ask whether Orpheus and company truly need another defense against the haters, even one packaged as a sympathetic ontology of the hate. But Lerner convinced me, at least, that distrust of poetry", "simmer in the United States\u2014and that it might seep in part from our early, Romantic association between poems and personhood, our sense that poetry expresses (and arises naturally from) an irreducible self. Told over and over that we are all poets (we just didn\u2019t know it!), perhaps we experience less accessible verse as an attack on our humanity.

Where I stand with Quinn is in her judgment that Lerner twists other people\u2019s words and arguments to serve his own ends. She cites his treatment of Plato, who did not exactly banish songsters from the ideal Republic, though such a prohibition would definitely be convenient for Lerner. You could also point out that the essay\u2019s interpretation of Marianne Moore only works if we suppress any knowledge of \u201cPoetry\u201d\u2019s earlier, rangier drafts, which reveal a markedly different set of concerns from Lerner\u2019s. (His: a wrestling match between the real and the possible. Hers: how artifice can flip over into genuine feeling.)", "That said, I don\u2019t mind Lerner\u2019s (post-modern) knack for creasing old materials into fresh critical origami.

Lerner\u2019s slapstick instincts make this spill\u2014hardly a novel concept in life or literature\u2014mercilessly funny. He nails the acceleration. His granular, giddy analysis of Scottish bard William Topaz McGonagall, \u201cwidely acclaimed as the worst poet in history,\u201d fascinates as the negative expression of a Parnassian ideal. It\u2019s also comedic gold.", "Toward the climactic end of the book, Lerner discusses a typographic mark called a virgule, the slash that appears in prose to represent poetic line breaks. Virgules arise when you cite or quote poems, but mostly stay out of poems themselves; where they exist, they distill a sense of distance, of the virtual. They evoke the elusive", "of poetry.

Maybe poetry remains atmospheric and diffuse, a lambent quality in the air. But on occasion we walk through it, part the right veil of molecules, and almost grasp something. Or we will next time!
