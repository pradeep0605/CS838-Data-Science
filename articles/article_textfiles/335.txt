{"Body": ["Illustration by", "When bookstore employee and indie author Hugh Howey published his short story \u201cWool\u201d as a 99-cent e-book on Amazon in July of 2011, he wasn\u2019t banking on the story transforming his career. He didn\u2019t even post a link to the story on his own", ". But \u201cWool,\u201d about a post-apocalyptic future in which society has been forced to live underground in a vast silo, quickly became the most popular thing he had ever written. By the end of October, the story had made it on the Kindle sci-fi best-seller list. Howey started to get emails from readers asking him for the rest of the story. There was no rest of the story, so Howey decided to write it.", "By January 2012, Howey had self-published five serial stories about that underground silo and collected all five into an ebook, the", ". Even as the", "landed on the", "best-seller list", ", Howey kept churning out prequels. And by the end of 2012, Howey had negotiated sweetheart deals with major publishing houses to release print editions of", "worldwide and had even optioned the film rights to Ridley Scott. Simon and Schuster releases", ", a print edition of the", ", this month.", "Howey\u2019s self-publishing Cinderella story is so compelling that it often becomes", "", "", "about", ". But way more fascinating than that is the way the world of", "reflects our own world\u2014and how Howey\u2019s interactions with readers are overturning the traditional relationship between an author, his creations, and his audience.", "As", "opens, Holston, the sheriff of the silo, is being sent to \u201ccleaning,\u201d a punishment that takes him to the toxic surface to scrub the sensors that project a view of the world above to the silo below. The description of the view is one of the only clues Howey provides about the world before the silo was created. It\u2019s a \u201cfamiliar and rotting skyline\u201d in which \u201cancient glass and steel stood distantly where people, it was suspected, had once lived aboveground.\u201d Like his wife, who had been sent to cleaning three years prior, Holston had committed the worst sin imaginable in the silo: asking to go outside. In", ", cleaning is both death sentence and human sacrifice: The pressure felt by thousands of people underground grows \u201clike steam building up in the silo, ready to launch something out\u201d and is transferred to one person, purged in an act conceived to remind the community that their silo is a shelter, not a prison.", "Of course, the silo feels like both, and that tension is at the heart of", ". Holston\u2019s cleaning sets off a chain of events that transition the action from short story to serial novel. Soon, the mayor of the silo needs to appoint a new sheriff and selects a smart and strong-willed candidate from the silo\u2019s mechanical department named Juliette. Juliette becomes obsessed with figuring out Holston\u2019s motivations, and her subsequent determination to uncover the truth about the silo\u2019s history and who\u2019s really in control of it (which I won\u2019t reveal here) creates the powder keg for an uprising within the silo. The escalation of anger to fissures within the silo and then finally to conflict is rendered deftly, and the pace at which Howey reveals the inner workings of the world of the silo makes", "a page-turner.", "The intrigue of", "(the title comes from the scrubbers used by people sent to clean the sensors on the surface) is enjoyable and thought-provoking, but it\u2019s how Howey borrows from our present that really makes", "resonate with readers. In many ways, the silo is a triumph of human survival and sustainability. It\u2019s an energy-independent community with 100 percent employment and universal access to education and health care. But it\u2019s also a carefully designed system with zero population growth, a lack of media, and social stratification created by the architecture of the silo itself. More than 100 floors deep and connected by only a narrow circular staircase, the silo is designed to limit mobility and communication, separating the mechanical department at the bottom, the mayor and sheriff up top, and the IT department as far away from both of them as possible. Readers\u2019 fascination of", "is powered not by the novelty of the silo, but the frightening familiarity of it. While most post-apocalyptic fiction invites us to imagine how civilization might evolve after the world as we know it ends,", "instead invites us to imagine what it might take\u2014and what the costs might be\u2014to prevent civilization from ever evolving beyond where we are right now.", "Howey also taps into many of our current anxieties. Who controls the flow of information to all of our screens? How much privacy and control are we willing to give up to ensure domestic security? And how much good will it do to know the truth if you can\u2019t change the system? It\u2019s this last question that fuels uprising in the silo. Knox, the head of Mechanical who rallies his colleagues and others to revolt, explains why his anger compels him to violence: \u201cI only want to hurt those that lied,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s all any of us want. We\u2019ve", "lived in fear. Fear of the outside. Fear of cleaning. Afraid to even talk about a better world. And none of it was true. The system was rigged, and in a way to make us hang our heads and", "it.\u201d Being in the silo is like living in a world where the decisions were made a long time ago by people you didn\u2019t vote for. Sound familiar?", "The disenfranchisement of silo residents contrasts interestingly with the way the stories themselves invert the traditional power dynamic between author and fan. By reaching out to Howey and leaving reviews that asked for more, fans helped conjure the fictional world that has come to mean so much to them. And through the power of self-publishing and social media, Howey converted interest in the first story into dedicated fandom and hundreds of thousands of e-book sales. By publishing", "serially, he was able to deliver stories quickly, building readership, excitement, and Amazon reviews that often resulted in", "stories occupying multiple slots on the same Amazon best-seller lists.

In an interview, I asked Howey about why he\u2019s not just encouraging fan fiction but actually endorsing it. \u201cThere\u2019s room for readers to become writers and play in this world,\u201d he said. \u201cI view fan fiction as the opportunity to teach readers how much joy there is in creating worlds instead of just living in them.\u201d Right now\u2014much to Simon and Schuster\u2019s chagrin, one has to imagine\u2014the", "", "of what are sure to be many", "-related fan fiction stories are available for sale on Amazon.", "But Howey is making some changes with", ", the", "sequel he\u2019s currently writing. First, it likely won\u2019t be a serial. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to write it as a single work,\u201d said Howey. \u201cIn fairness to the reader, I think it\u2019s going to be nice to give them the entire work so they don\u2019t have to wait in between pieces.\u201d The sequel also promises to be darker than", ": \u201cAt what point does an uprising cause more harm than an evil totalitarian regime?\u201d asked Howey. \u201cThat\u2019s not a fun question to ask, because we\u2019re used to telling stories where we overthrow the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.\u201d", "Will fans tolerate a Juliette who does as much harm as good? Will fans tolerate a Howey who does not solicit feedback and encouragement as he creates the next (and final, he says) installment of their favorite series? Perhaps not, and it\u2019s fascinating that Howey\u2019s planning on exercising his authorial power without necessarily seeking buy-in from readers.
