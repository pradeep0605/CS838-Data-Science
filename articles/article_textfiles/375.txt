{"Body": ["Illustration by Pat Grant.", "Most poets start out in a kind of Eden, one that typically coincides with adolescence. Convinced of the great importance of everything, their own thoughts most of all, they name the world and find it beautiful. But poets eventually grow up, and these days they tend to learn a few lessons along the way\u2014that the most important thing about many of us is the harm our way of living does; that not only is our self-importance suspect, but so is the idea that we have a stable self; and that beauty may be truth but truth is relative. Many of the best poets find ways of turning lessons like these into new sources of energy, creating new Edens teeming with predators and weeds.", "Paisley Rekdal, the author of three previous books of poems as well as a smart and entertaining memoir-in-essays,", ", has stocked her latest collection,", ", with plenty of bad news\u2014ecological corruption, a death from cancer caused by pesticides, a relationship suffocated by race. And yet this is a book built on pleasure, a convincingly, if subtly, joyous engagement with a world where \u201cthere is so little distinction \u2026 / between beauty, violence, utility.\u201d", "Take this excerpt from her poem \u201cBallard Locks,\u201d where she writes of salmon passing through man-made protective tanks as they head upstream to spawn. They are, she says:", "more like sequined", "purses than fish, champagned explosions", "beneath which the ever-moving", "smolt fume smacks against glass, churns them up", "to lake from sea level, the way", "outside, fishing boats are dropped or raised", "in pressured chambers, hoses spraying", "the salt-slicked undersides a cleaner clean.", "Now the vessels", "can return to dock. Now the fish,", "in their similar chambers, rise and fall", "along the weirs \u2026", "", "It\u2019s a poem in part about the fact that we so often understand nature at one remove\u2014through glass, through associations with other man-made things (purses, champagne bottles, boats). Later on, it\u2019s also a poem about our desire to get closer and the degree to which that appetite is fueled by violence\u2014we want to get closer to nature so we can kill and consume.", "But poetry is its own remove, and Rekdal\u2019s description is full of barely contained excitement, the adjectives reaching over line-breaks for their nouns twice in the first three lines, runs of heavily stressed syllables rattling against each other, as in \u201csmolt fume smacks against glass,\u201d with its intricate networks of matching and opposing consonants and vowels. (Say it out loud, paying attention to the ways your lips, tongue, and vocal cords move.) And then the relief that starts to set in after \u201cthe way,\u201d including a few runs of iambic regularity (\u201cthe vessels/ can return to dock,\u201d \u201crise and fall along the weirs\u201d), an orderliness that\u2019s much more vibrant than the sanitizing order it describes.", "Like pretty much all collections,", "doesn\u2019t always live up to its best moments. (Not coincidentally, most poetry books also feel too long.) The weaker poems here aren\u2019t bad, and they often include good stories, including Rekdal\u2019s painfully funny account of (accidentally) inciting a lemur escape in the Lisbon zoo. But in telling these stories, Rekdal loses some of the richness that defines the lines above. It feels like the obligation to get to each detail in the proper order distracts her, and instead of the poetic rhythms enriching the prose, they seem, at times, to run in uneasy parallel.", "In a lesser book, these same poems still might be standouts, but they lack the physicality of Rekdal\u2019s best writing (which, for readers of Elizabeth Bishop, may also spur a thrill of recognition). You can hear it again in this passage from \u201cArctic Scale,\u201d a breathtaking stanza that appears immediately after the disquieting lines \u201coil rigs dip their certain needles/ and the Inuit women\u2019s breast milk has been declared/ hazardous waste\u201d:", "It is so beautiful here. Here is a wall-sized field of green", "with patches of corn silk. Here is a miraculous range", "seamed with what I have to be told is coal,", "the enormous, glassy sea chattering its blue", "to the sky, the glacier clasped between them", "quietly disappearing.", "Photograph by Tommy Chandler.", "One of my favorite poems in the book is titled, simply, \u201cHappiness.\u201d It\u2019s a risky poem in a way, one that chooses joy when others are suffering, and if it were any less well-written\u2014any less full of joy to be had by anyone who finds it, any less adept in enacting the appetite that underpins our joy\u2014I suspect it would feel cheap or even grotesque.", "At the poem\u2019s end, Rekdal writes of unhappy neighbors, and of her garden, which \u201clives alongside their misery./ It glows each evening with a violent light.\u201d", "Writing gives us a way of living beyond our means. \u201cThe magpie comes and all I can think is/", "\u201d Rekdal exclaims in \u201cCloser,\u201d \u201cthough you said/ it\u2019s a junk bird, though its commonness/ makes most ignore it.\u201d In acknowledging the disappointing facts of our existence", "singing her way into its amazement, she has created poetry that lives alongside the misery we sometimes witness\u2014and sometimes cause.", "", "Jonathan Farmer is the editor-in-chief and poetry editor of", ".", "", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
