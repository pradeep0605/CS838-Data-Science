{"Body": ["Illustration by Peter Bagge", "For a couple of years, I wrote a horoscope column for my college paper under the name \u201cClaire Connection.\u201d (The pseudonym was meant as parody, but\u2014as I discovered when an actual astrologer by that name wrote my editor a threatening email\u2014it wasn\u2019t.) Despite the flippancy with which I approached the task then, I do still find myself turning to the horoscopes from time to time. Because you needn\u2019t buy what astrology\u2019s selling to be interested in the conjunction it forces between human make-believe and the arbitrary structure of things, a curious relation that the discipline (if one may be allowed to call it that) throws into relief: We\u2019re unwilling to give up on freedom, serendipity, and plain old hard work\u2014but we don\u2019t want to just be a fluke. There\u2019s a deep reassurance to be had in feeling oneself part of some great cosmic cycle.", "Eleanor Catton\u2019s", ", an 848-page novel", "for the Man Booker prize, situates itself within this dilemma from the start. In the opening scene, the Scotsman Walter Moody, newly arrived in the New Zealand gold town Hokitika in 1866, unwittingly disrupts a secret meeting: \u201cThe twelve men congregated in the smoking room of the Crown Hotel gave the impression of a party accidentally met. \u2026 indeed, the studied isolation of each man as he pored over his paper, or leaned forward to tap his ashes into the grate, or placed the splay of his hand upon the baize to take his shot at billiards, conspired to form the very type of bodily silence that occurs, late in the evening, on a public railway.\u201d The description of this seemingly \u201caccidental\u201d arrangement\u2014one that is in fact \u201cstudied,\u201d and \u201cconspired,\u201d conjures not so much the train as the theater, and, sure enough, each player has been blocked into his proper corner. (This is true of Moody as well, as it happens, though he seems to have wandered in from the wings.)", "is, among other things, an experiment in predetermination. By extinguishing every coincidence, it turns literature into the same kind of problem as astrology: Do we want structural interpretation to dictate narrative, or is it best when a story\u2019s structure, as one character puts it, \u201calways changes in the telling\u201d?", "One way to read Catton\u2019s novel is as kind of antipodean crossword, in which the clues lead one not to a filling-in of blanks but to the erasure of content\u2014so the solution is little more than the grid into which everything fit. Each of the novel\u2019s 12 sections begins with an astrological chart for the date and location of its setting, which dictates what and how events will unfold. A \u201cCharacter Chart\u201d at the front of the book indicates 12 \u201cstellar\u201d characters, each associated with a sign of the zodiac and a location representing one of the astrological houses. These determine both the character\u2019s destiny and his personal characteristics. Example: One chapter indicates that the constellation Aries\u2014represented here by the Maori hunter Te Rau Tawhare\u2014is in the third house, which in astrology has to do with brotherhood, communication, etc., all of which make sense in the context of the plot. In addition to these zodiac-affiliated characters, there are seven \u201cplanetary\u201d ones that rotate throughout the astrological chart from month to month. One quickly discovers that the chapter titled \u201cVenus in Capricorn\u201d will primarily consist of a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between the characters associated with Venus (the alluring Lydia Wells) and Capricorn (Aubert Gascoigne, a clerk).", "The titular \u201cluminaries\u201d\u2014the astrological designation for sun and moon\u2014are the opium-addicted whore Anna Wetherall and the prospector Emery Staines. In astrology, the sun more or less represents exterior, visible things, and the moon personal, internal ones, ergo so do these two\u2014but they often reflect one another, exchanging qualities. Emery, in what is clearly a lunar phase, describes their relationship as \u201ca connexion, by virtue of which he feels less, rather than more, complete, in the sense that her nature, being both oppositional to and in accord with his own, seems to illumine those internal aspects of his character that his external manner does not or cannot betray, leaving him feeling \u2026 doubled when in her presence, and halved when out of it.\u201d And then there is Crosbie Wells, a drunkard whose murder is the still point around which the whole novel turns: Earth, in other words.", "As if this were not enough, the very length of the novel\u2019s 12 sections has been planned in advance, beginning at 360 pages (not coincidentally, the number of degrees in a circle), and declining progressively until the final part of just three. The number of chapters per section also systematically wanes: The first has 12, the second, 11, and so on, down to one. By the end, the book had dwindled to almost nothing\u2014chapters present the barest sketches of events, even as they attempt a final, revealing explanation of the novel\u2019s mysteries. Meanwhile, the little explanatory", "at each chapter\u2019s head slowly waxes to eclipse it: commentary stealing the function of story.", "Encased in this postmodern complexity is a plot\u2014a \u201csphere within a sphere,\u201d as one chapter has it\u2014about as pre-modern as it gets, a mystery having to do with hidden gold, a prostitute\u2019s suicide attempt, and the disappearance of a wealthy man. Arbitrary-seeming circumlocutions (\u201cd---ned\u201d), chapter headings", "Dickens (\u201cIn which we learn \u2026\u201d), the word \u201cconnexion,\u201d and the authorial second person plural are all", ". Vividly set in the gold rush of the mid-1860s,", "is, on this level, a fairly straightforward page-turner in the \u201csensation novel\u201d mode, with the full complement of Victorian clich\u00e9s: whores, bastard brothers, eavesdropping, a s\u00e9ance, murder, shipwrecks, impersonation, a dead baby, purloined letters, and a pistol hidden in someone\u2019s bosom, to start. Ignore the astrology, and the characters are stock: an Irish reverend with bad teeth, a couple of Chinese \u201cJohnnies,\u201d a conniving madam with a sideline in the occult, noble savage, scar-faced villain, guileless naif, and so on. Everyone has secrets. Everyone remembers things just when doing so is most convenient. Events are often narrated second-, and even third-hand, explanations given, and scenes unfold within scenes within scenes, creating layers of revelation. The initial theatrical impression\u2019s sustained: Two characters find themselves momentarily \u201cfixed in a tableau, the kind rendered on a plate, and sold at a fair as a historical impression\u201d; Moody\u2019s hotel room is \u201cfurnished very approximately, as in a pantomime where a large and lavish household is conjured by a single chair.\u201d One might use similar metaphors for the novel as a whole.", "Throughout, an authorial voice chimes in to assist, warn, and regret. Part of its function is to force the novel\u2019s parts rather blatantly into line: \u201cWe shall here excise their imperfections \u2026 we shall apply our own mortar to the cracks and chinks of earthly recollection, and resurrect as new the edifice that, in solitary memory, exists only as a ruin.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d is hugely contrived, but then contrivance is what", "rests on. Lunar cycles mandate the narrative\u2019s return it to its beginning; a full year of star charts races the last quarter of the novel through 1865; even the name \u201cHokitika,\u201d which in Maori means, approximately, \u201cAround. And then back again, beginning\u201d is unequivocal. The introductory \u201cNote to the Reader\u201d (another period nod) even lays out the plot\u2019s themes, associating it with the Age of Pisces and things \u201cPiscean\u201d in quality: \u201cmirrors, tenacity, instinct, twinship, and hidden things.\u201d Not just contrivance, but highly visible contrivance, underlies everything: Unlike, say, Bola\u00f1o\u2019s similarly lengthy", ",", "contains\u2014nay, advertises\u2014the keys to its own exposition.", "Robert Catto", "The question this raises is what effect such structural contrivances have on a reader\u2019s pleasure\u2014whether what we call \u201cnovel\u201d and especially \u201cbig, ambitious novel,\u201d is supposed to exist at the level of plot, or sentence, or on this third, impositional plane. Yes, Catton\u2019s language is beautifully tended-seeming, luminous in a mode appropriate to the 19", "century cadence of her tale. There are no sloppy sentences, nothing that strikes one as unintentional or out of her control. Her observations too are astute, as when two men at a party bear \u201cthe distant, slightly disappointed aspect of one who is comparing the scene around him, unfavourably, to other scenes, both real and imagined, that have happened, and are happening, elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0So it\u2019s possible to read the book with pleasure strictly on the level of what one might call its \u201cliterary merits\u201d\u2014or it would be, if only its author would let you.", "She doesn\u2019t. Neither are we allowed to fully engage on the level of characters or plot\u2014the astrological contrivance is too shifty for that. Moody, for instance, represented by the planet Mercury, is initially placed to be a kind of go-between with the reader, following, as he does, just slightly behind the \u201cstellar\u201d players as they explain their involvement in events; Thomas Balfour (Sagittarius), a shipping magnate, seems set up as our central \u201cexplainer.\u201d But then the heavens shift, Mercury moves out of Balfour\u2019s sign, and these two are flipped offstage like figures in a paper theater while others pop up to replace them. In fact, once the structural conceit becomes apparent, every detail of the novel glows with such intention that it almost blinds you to the pleasures of story. One becomes obsessive: Is the divider, the Greek letter \u03a6, used for its symbolic affinity to the golden mean? Or does it stand for the constellation Ophiuchus, sometimes called the 13", "zodiac sign? Catton never allows you to relinquish the impression that there are answers to be found, and that like a crossword, the novel might be no more than a sophisticated amusement.", "Whether one appreciates this point is the question that emerges, in its sly, interesting way, in and through the novel\u2019s pseudoscientific groundwork. How and why, when so much care is manifest, do we feel manhandled? Do subjective responses suffer when an author\u2014or the cosmos, in this case\u2014dictates every element of the work to the point that even after 848 pages both character and plot can be drowned out by their own determinant structure? As in astrology, these questions have to do with relation, primarily that between the \u201cwarm\u201d pleasure of emotional engagement and the \u201ccool\u201d pleasure of a game\u2014pleasure as activity versus pleasure as state. That Catton has provided a \u201csolution\u201d to her novel might strike some as diminishing its ability to generate the jagged thrill of the big (usually male-penned) novels it draws comparison to by virtue of sheer bulk\u2014", "or", "say, or indeed", ". It may, by virtue of this, seem far less \u201cserious\u201d or worthy.", "Catton, when", "was first published, was 27, and when I mention this to my group of 30-ish, novel-less peers, the reaction generally takes the form of whatever the opposite of", "is: from", "and", ", to", "? These are ugly, unfair (and some will inevitably say sexist) reactions, but ugly or not, they are worth acknowledging, and not entirely irrelevant either, it so happens. Because jealous displeasure with Catton\u2019s age-to-successes ratio stems from the same root as our discomfort with something as perfectly formed as her novel: a longing, in the midst of being impressed, for that truth inhabited by things spontaneous, ragged-edged, wounded, or imperfect, for things that are granted the freedom to fail. This is the point", "makes, in the end, having gone so far to the other extreme\u2014its seamlessness delivers us around, and then back again. Perhaps, as Catton\u2019s Emery Staines explains, \u201cTrue feeling is always circular\u2014either circular or paradoxical\u2014simply because its cause and its expression are two halves of the very same thing!\u201d That\u2019s because it is", "who both make novels and feel things about them\u2014and while we might be conceived in chaos, we tell ourselves stories so as not to be.", "---", "by Eleanor Catton.
