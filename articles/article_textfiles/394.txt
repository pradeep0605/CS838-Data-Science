Indeed, it\u2019s striking how specifically nonliterary were the terms DeForest chose to describe its merits: The novel, he wrote, is \u201ca picture of American life, drawn with a few strong and passionate strokes, not filled in thoroughly, but still a portrait.\u201d But one hangs a portrait on the wall.
