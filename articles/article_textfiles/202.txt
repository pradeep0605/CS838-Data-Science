{"Body": ["Photo by David Zaugh", "There\u2019s something both enticing and paradoxical about calling your book of personal revelations", ", especially when you tack on a winking subtitle like", "The name of Meghan Daum\u2019s new essay collection promises transgression and absolute candor, pledging that what\u2019s unsayable won\u2019t be left unsaid. You can just hear the breathless, cheesy tagline", "might have if it were not an essay collection but instead a movie from the 1950s:", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "But Daum\u2019s brave, funny compendium would not be at home in such sensational packaging. Nor, for that matter, does the book have quite the unity that Daum gamely tries to give it in the introduction. \u201cAt its core,\u201d Daum writes, laying out her pitch, \u201cthis book is about the ways that some of life\u2019s most burning issues are considered inappropriate for public or even private discussion. It\u2019s about the unspeakable thoughts many of us harbor \u2026 but can only talk about in coded terms.\u201d", "I\u2019m not sure I agree with her assessment of", "\u2019s central theme. (Though I understand why she makes it: A \u201csincere but mediated assemblage of personal anecdotes spun into intelligent reflections on being alive\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t sell many copies.) Daum\u2019s disclosures\u2014which \u201caren\u2019t confessions,\u201d she specifies, but \u201cevents recounted in the service of ideas\u201d\u2014include: She was relieved when her cancer-stricken mother finally passed away. She spent much of her life resenting the elder Daum, a theater teacher who dressed up \u201cneediness\u201d as \u201cfabulousness.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want children. This is the \u201ccentral sadness\u201d of her marriage. Games, vacations, and the fragrant totems of foodie culture bore her. (\u201cI do not enjoy most activities that are commonly labeled \u2018fun,\u2019 \u201d Daum notes, with mordant pleasure. \u201cI am weary of happiness, both as a word and as a concept.\u201d) She dislikes working too hard for things, preferring to stay within her comfort zone. \u201cThough I probably shouldn\u2019t admit this,\u201d she admits, \u201cthe activities and pursuits in which I\u2019ve achieved any measure of success are, without exception, activities and pursuits that came easily to me from the beginning.\u201d", "Daum wants us to understand that the dream of authenticity is its own kind of sentimental romance.", "Daum is not simply unburdening herself with this litany of unflattering facts\u2014if they are indeed unflattering, rather than forgivable and human. She offers the examples in order to interrogate sentimentality, the myths we wrap around our lives. Like Leslie Jamison, whose essay collection", "was published", ", Daum pokes at how \u201chuman experiences too often come with preassigned emotional responses.\u201d This brooks-no-malarkey pose feels genuine\u2014but Daum complicates it as well. In the essay \u201cHonorary Dyke,\u201d Daum frames a lifelong attraction to butchness as an allergic flinch from all the butterfly barm of femininity: the baby showers, the dating rigmaroles, the cosmetic rites, the self-absorption. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to take care of our families or have beautiful, meticulously kept homes or that we can\u2019t have strong opinions about furniture upholstery,\u201d Daum says of \u201caspirational dykes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s that we\u2019re going to express these opinions \u2026 with a certain anti-girliness, a certain lack of bullshit.\u201d Her sense of belonging later wanes a bit when she accompanies her trial-girlfriend to a gay bar\u2014all \u201cunironic mullets\u201d and \u201cmafia wives\u201d\u2014and realizes \u201cI was not a lesbian so much as someone who appreciated a good haircut.\u201d", "In \u201cThe Dog Exception,\u201d Daum explains why she associates Malamutes with unicorns. Dogs are \u201cincapable of phoniness,\u201d she writes, \u201cimmune to manufactured emotion or self-engineered cuteness.\u201d She grew up in a household that prized \u201csubstance\u201d\u2014so much so that her mother urged her, at 7, to devise a more impressively original message for her birthday cake than \u201cHappy Birthday, Meghan.\u201d (They wound up with \u201cHappy Birthday, Animal Lover,\u201d an inscription that, in its flirtation with obscene innuendo, seems like karmic comeuppance for terrible parenting.)", "Yet Daum also knows that her tough \u201cantischmaltz policy\u201d is itself a posture, another writerly narrative. She allows us glimpses of gauze, from her precept that \u201cthe human heart is pretty pie chart resistant\u201d to her faith (not borne out by her experience as an advocate for foster-care kids) that \u201cnurture from a loving adoptive community\u201d might \u201ctriumph over the abuses of horrible natural parents.\u201d Dogs reduce her to a pile of goo, and ironically their lack of affectation only stokes her belief in a fanciful, cartoonish afterlife for pets. For all her straight talk, Daum wants us to understand that the dream of authenticity is its own kind of sentimental romance. Authenticity, she seems to say, is our buzzy shorthand for truth, which we count on to do what myths do: light up the dark, scary spaces. Confronted with the unknowability of an animal\u2019s mind, with a perceived absence of counterfeit, we can\u2019t help but \u201cfill it with rainbows and wet furrylicious kisses.\u201d", "But reality versus our willful insulation from same isn\u2019t Daum\u2019s big theme, even if the introduction says it is. Instead, these essays do what essays often set out to do: trace the outlines of a self. They show an author exposing her particular being to the world, watching what happens, and coming to terms with the fallout. And they do it wonderfully, weaving a theory of identity as both unknowable and inescapable. \u201cNot What It Used to Be,\u201d for example, hearkens back to Daum\u2019s first collection,", "in its elegy for lost time. In middle age, Daum writes, \u201cany traces of precocity I ever had are long forgotten. I am not and will never again be a young writer, a young homeowner, a young teacher. \u2026 The only thing I could do now for which my youth would be a truly notable feature would be to die.\u201d This should give you a flavor of her wry, piquant voice. (Or try this: \u201cAnthropologie \u2026 is to adult women what princesses are to little girls. It is a twirling motion in the form of an international brand.\u201d) Yet despite the fading of some shiny sense of possibility, the \u201colder self of our imagination never quite folds itself into the older self we actually become.\u201d \u201cLife,\u201d Daum concludes, \u201cis mostly an exercise in being something other than what we used to be while remaining fundamentally\u2014and sometimes maddeningly\u2014who we are.\u201d", "is strewn with Daum\u2019s attempts to lose herself, and with her slow, painful returns to center. She dabbles in gayness, in ill-fitting maternal roles. She tries, Emerson-like, to cast herself not as a human being but as a disembodied eye in the universe. (\u201cLos Angeles is where I learned that your ability to see is sometimes only as good as your willingness to go unseen,\u201d she writes at one point, wearing her invisibility at a gathering of Hollywood stars as a badge of honor.) There is a beautiful sway in these essays in and out of self-awareness.\u00a0And as Daum tests the edges of who she is, the reader feels similar waves of identification and then distance, at times resonating intimately to a point the narrator makes, at times feeling that their two consciousnesses don\u2019t overlap at all.", "There\u2019s a moment of arrival, or maybe just repose, in a late essay, where Daum seems to stake out her boundaries for good. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s highly overrated,\u201d she writes, striking a note somewhere between self-mockery and earned wisdom. (In Daum\u2019s world, maturity is not mellow, but tart.) \u201cGoing outside your comfort zone.\u201d She continues: \u201cStay in safe waters but plunge as deeply into them as possible. If you\u2019re good at something, do it a lot. If you\u2019re bad at something, just don\u2019t do it.\u201d", "But Daum also succeeds in losing herself in these pages. The last piece, \u201cDiary of a Coma,\u201d recounts a terrifying bout of murine typhus, a rare bacterial infection that first takes away Daum\u2019s words and then pushes her out of consciousness. The hyper-articulate voice we\u2019ve come to trust describes the terror of aphasia, the dispersal of an inner life into fragments that can\u2019t be grasped or said. Then, coming out of the illness, Daum writes, \u201cI am locating the letters of the alphabet \u2026 I am coming back to myself. And I am no wiser or more evolved than I was before. There is no epiphany or revelation or aha moment or big click. There is no redemption. There is no great lesson learned. There is only the unknowable and the unspeakable.\u201d", "Which suggests, contra the promise of the introduction, that Daum\u2019s \u201cunspeakable\u201d isn\u2019t some transformative truth finally spoken once you work up the courage. It is what you get instead of a payoff. It is the silence after you\u2019ve said all you can say and done all you can do (i.e. after you\u2019ve lived a life on Earth). For Daum, maybe, it was the condition of drifting away from herself, as in a coma, and finding nothing but blank space\u2014since, as she now knows and insists, you can never really be someone other than who you are.", "---", ", by Meghan Daum.
