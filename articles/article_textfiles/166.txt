Each successive novel has centered on a detective introduced in a previous novel. It\u2019s a handy gimmick, sure, but it\u2019s also created a structure that\u2019s allowed French to explore, in increasingly nuanced ways, the city she calls home.", "In the first of the series,", "(2007), Detective Rob Ryan investigates a homicide in a suburban Dublin estate where he was the victim of an unsolved crime 20 years prior.

Because each detective has a different history in the city, each book investigates a set of locations and relationships from his or her point of view; because they all remain connected, each book provides an opportunity to see characters we\u2019ve already met through a different set of eyes. There is no objective vision in French\u2019s novels. Reading them is a singular experience of discovery and rediscovery, and each book evokes the gratifying feeling of gaining unexpected insight into a person or place you thought you knew well.", "Frank spent 20 years hoping that Rosie was \u201cthe one that got away,\u201d only to find her buried in the place she sought to escape.", "Like those girls in the shopping center, all of French\u2019s characters are compelled by the idea of home. Rob, Frank, and Mick have to make homecomings, of various sorts, in order to solve their cases. Cassie finds herself unexpectedly drawn into a circle of friends who\u2019ve conspired to create a family for themselves by excising their pasts. And the girls of St. Kilda\u2019s try to negotiate their liminal space by carving out a makeshift home where friends become family. French\u2019s novels are full of Dubliners yearning for places to call their own. Kids take to the woods behind their estates, colonize abandoned row houses, and lay claim to private spaces beyond school walls. Adults are often consumed by finding, buying, and inheriting houses.", "This desire for home is inexorably tied, French makes clear, to the history of Ireland. \u201cThis country\u2019s passion for property is built into the blood,\u201d Cassie observes in", ", \u201ca current as huge and primal as desire. Centuries of being turned out on the roadside at a landlord\u2019s whim, helpless, teach your bones that everything in life hangs on owning your home.\u201d The legacies of colonialism, battles over Home Rule, and waves of emigration underpin the development of modern Dublin. Tana French explores not just", ", but also what drives it.", "The rise and fall of the Celtic Tiger has served as backdrop of all of French\u2019s novels. The childhood homes of the detectives evoke the recession of the 1970s and \u201980s. Rob Ryan\u2019s family was among the first Dubliners to move to the suburban estate of Knocknaree, a location that offered families the opportunity to \u201cescape from the tenements and outdoor toilets that went unmentioned in 1970s Ireland\u201d and \u201cbuy as close to home as a teacher\u2019s or bus driver\u2019s salary would let them.\u201d The Faithful Place of Frank Mackey\u2019s youth was full of \u201cfactory workers, bricklayers, bakers, dole bunnies, and the odd lucky bastard who worked in Guinness\u2019s and got health care and evening classes.\u201d", "Courtesy of Kyran O'Brien", "When Rob returns to Knocknaree, the woods, and the archeological site they cover, are just a month away from being bulldozed to make way for a new motorway.\u00a0 When it comes to real estate, all roads either lead into or out of Dublin.

She\u2019s more interested in how development surfaces the past even as it buries it, bringing old history and resentments into the present. In", ", the manor that Cassie Maddox and her companions occupy is the \u201cBig House\u201d from an Anglo-Irish feudal estate. The locals, descendants of the villagers who were brought to the area to work for the estate, are eager to see the house sold to developers to help shore up the local economy. \u201cAll these private, parallel dimensions,\u201d Rob Ryan observes about Knocknaree, \u201cunderlying such an innocuous estate; all these self-contained worlds layered onto the same space.\u201d He could easily be characterizing many of the places in French\u2019s novels. Even St. Kilda\u2019s, where the sequestered world of teen girls seems far outside history, was \u201csomeone\u2019s ancestral home, once.\u201d", "And the precipitating event in", "is development: Construction work on an abandoned row house turns up Rosie Daly\u2019s suitcase and leads Frank Mackey to her body.

French chooses Dublin Castle as the headquarters for her Dublin Murder Squad.

Despite their trauma-filled childhoods, Frank, Rob, and Mick hold on to the belief that the country was safer when they were kids. \u201cSafe as houses,\u201d is how Frank Mackey describes the 1980s, without any irony, despite the fact that he was anything but safe from violence and abuse in his own home. This nostalgia often carries over into a reverence for an older, more \u201creal\u201d Dublin, the city of bricks and stone that will inevitably outlast the modern glass and steel structures being built over the top of it. When he looks at \u201cshoddy new apartment blocks and the neon signs,\u201d Frank Mackey thinks, \u201cThey\u2019re nothing; they\u2019re not real. In a hundred years they\u2019ll be gone, replaced and forgotten. \u2026 it\u2019s the old stuff, the stuff that\u2019s endured, that might just keep enduring.\u201d", "Tana French\u2019s Dublin is, itself, not quite real: She blends fictional locations with actual ones.
