You cannot see the shape, the placement of beginning, middle, and end. Perhaps God achieved omniscience by looking down from above on the outspread textile of eternity, but as far as the living were concerned, days passed in a fever of mutability, chaos, and strangeness. Where you\u2019d progressed to on your own timeline, what the shapes around you might portend\u2014it all blurred into nonsense. Augustine suggested that life is but a dream, at least during the interval of dreaming.

This is a place in which the Cheshire Cat confides to Ada, a child who has accidentally followed Alice into Wonderland: \u201cThey buried me under the Iffley yew. \u2026 It\u2019s true cats have nine lives, you know. But cats can\u2019t count. So I don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d Scoliosis has twisted Ada\u2019s spine; she wears an iron corset to correct her posture, until it flies off of its own accord. (Wonderland, we\u2019re to believe, is so warped and weird that in context a curved backbone becomes straight). As a heroine, Ada shares Alice\u2019s seriousness in the face of balderdash. She is willing to follow grown-up-sounding plaits of logic to their absurd conclusions. \u201cA door is not a door when it is ajar,\u201d she tells the Walrus and the Carpenter. The contradictory, baffling, and often hypocritical mores of Victorian England have taught her well.", "While Ada traipses around Wonderland meeting all manner of familiar characters (including, in one frumiously tense scene, the Jabberwock), her governess teams up with Alice\u2019s older sister Lydia to find the lost children. Both women are enmeshed in a confusing set of social understandings and subjugations. They cannot, for instance, enter the Oxford gardens, where \u201ca serene sort of male calm obtained.\u201d Yet they can wander \u201cpast Park Town, where the university\u2019s dons, forbidden marriage, were said to lodge their female companions.\u201d Complicating matters further, an ailing scientist named Mr. Darwin has come to visit Alice\u2019s father. Though he studies \u201cthe descent of man\u201d in a morally neutral sense, to his religious contemporaries his theories augur a dustward tumble from grace. He has with him a handsome American abolitionist, Josiah Winter (whose \u201csilvery blond\u201d hair and \u201cneat form\u201d intrigue both Lydia and the governess) and an ex-slave named Siam. Siam knows all about the liberties the Underworld makes possible: He rode the Underground Railroad to freedom.", "Photo by Andy Newman", "Is this modern-seeming consciousness to class, race, and gender a betrayal of the whimsical world Alice visited long ago and far away?

When you look closer, you see that Wonderland declares its own capricious rules and categories, and enforces them via homicidal scythe-wielding cards. For all the singsong and play, Carroll\u2019s fantasia wasn\u2019t so much an escape from reality as a distorted reflection of it. Maguire understands this; in the Lydia sections, his sensitivity to the moral whiplash of 19", "-century social practice almost obviates the need for Wonderland at all. Mourning her dead mother, unsure of her station, half in love with Winter, and perplexed by Siam, Lydia, not Ada, proves the novel\u2019s more interesting protagonist.", "Then again, we are talking about Gregory Maguire, which means that the ideas and the language outshine the characters anyway. (So too with Carroll, who rather than aiming for psychological realism made cipher-like Alice a reactress to his verbal and imaginative hijinks.)

Inevitably, Lydia ends up meeting a shy, stuttering Oxford boy struggling with a camera in one of the university\u2019s forbidden gardens. She ducks inside a cave of black fabric to operate the machine while he poses on the lawn. She notices his expression, \u201csweetly alert, and trembling.\u201d She takes the picture. \u201cTime seemed to stand still,\u201d Maguire tells us. \u201cHe froze in his place.\u201d", "The meta-encounter unfolds years before Dodgson supposedly used his writing to fan the flames of his", ", Alice Liddell. Though Maguire never invokes the pedophilia accusations it has become fashionable to levy against Carroll, there is something in this moment of Saint Augustine, and the uncertainty about what shape a life will take. In a similar scene, Ada and Siam huddle under another spire of dark cloth: a cloak made of seaweed. Ada begins to see images on the sides of the cape, \u201cglowing and insubstantial, as if thrown by a magic lantern,\u201d fragments of her earlier adventures\u2014talking roses, a quixotic White Knight, a singing pig, marionettes. \u201cThe difficulty,\u201d writes Maguire, \u201cwas in assembling such contrary information into coherence. Whenever she thought she might have begun to manage it, the images slid and shifted. The material meant something different.\u201d", "Nonsense and incoherence, then, are a kind of innocence. They mean that you are free and undetermined\u2014in the middle of your life. Along with the momentary aspect of the boy, Lydia\u2019s photo captures \u201can imprecise glow \u2026 the look of a hastening creature not intended to be caught by such a tool.\u201d It is a mercy that the White Rabbit escapes.
