{"Body": ["Luke Howard", "You have to feel bad for a writer who, waiting out the eternity between finishing a book and its pub date, awakens one morning to find that not only is her subject all over the headlines but that the breaking news is landscape-altering. Or so I was thinking when, shortly after my copy of Jessica Bennett\u2019s", "arrived, former Fox newscaster Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment suit against Fox chairman and uber-creep Roger Ailes, ultimately bringing down one of the most powerful and seemingly inviolable men in corporate America. Not so inviolable after all, it turned out. Sure his severance package was more than most people\u2019s lifetime earnings, but even so, the status quo of sexist office culture had been irrevocably shattered.", "When Rupert Murdoch", "are the public face of workplace gender reform, the world really is in transition. I suppose it\u2019s too early to gauge the extent of the trickle-down effect on American offices, but I\u2019d like to think that handsy, won\u2019t-take-no-for-an-answer bosses and co-workers\u2014a big chunk of the Fox demographic, I assume\u2014have been undergoing collective, painful lightning bolts of self-recognition. \u201cRoger, c\u2019est moi,\u201d I picture them gasping to themselves, fending off waves of self-disgust and thanking God they\u2019d had the chance to reform their nasty ways before they too made headlines.", "When Rupert Murdoch", "are the public face of workplace gender reform, the world really is in transition.", "Anyway, such were my fantasies when I began", ", wondering what advice Bennett would have given Carlson and the rest of Ailes\u2019 female prey in the Fox newsroom. I found to my surprise that Bennett doesn\u2019t actually address the subject of sexual harassment, which I\u2019d always assumed was one of the main things making sexist workplaces sexist. But no, aside from a brief mention of guys she calls \u201clurkers\u201d\u2014the sort who spend too much time hanging around your desk for no reason\u2014sexual harassment isn\u2019t on Bennett\u2019s radar.", "Nor does pay equity occupy much of the book\u2014it gets one paragraph, in which we learn that if you adjust for comparable colleges and job choices, first-year female college graduates make \u201cjust 93 percent of what their male peers do.\u201d I wondered why that \u201cjust\u201d was necessary, since a 7 percent pay differential sounds like progress to me. (Overall women make 79 percent of male income, Bennett says, but it\u2019s a hard number to pin down precisely, given men\u2019s and women\u2019s different life trajectories, meaning the children thing.)", "So if sexual harassment and pay equity aren\u2019t the problem, what is? It turns out that the forms of workplace sexism Bennett has in mind are the subtler, harder-to-contest varieties, in part because the guys enacting them are often nice enough fellows, not jerks. They\u2019re your friends, progressives even. The offenses range from familiar female complaints\u2014being interrupted, being asked to get coffee and take notes at meetings, having your ideas ripped off without credit by male colleagues\u2014to what seem like fairly minor irritants in the larger scheme of things: air conditioning geared to male body temperature, guys deploying sports lingo (like congratulating you on your \u201cslam dunk\u201d), and being called \u201ckiddo.\u201d", "Bennett\u2019s move is to update the familiar complaints with a lot of cute names\u2014male types to watch out for include the Manterrupter, the Dismisser, the Bropriator, the Himitator, the Menstruhater (who thinks it\u2019s always \u201cthat time of the month\u201d when a woman gets irritable), and the Stenographucker, who treats you like the office secretary. Based on strategy sessions with her own \u201cfeminist fight club\u201d\u2014a group of similarly situated friends who get together to carp about work\u2014she offers advice in the form of \u201cFight Moves\u201d: \u201cPut the Phucker in His Place,\u201d \u201cUnderpromise, Overdeliver,\u201d \u201cThrow to a Bro,\u201d \u201cWomanspread.\u201d When asked to make coffee, turn yourself into a \u201cBad Barista\u201d\u2014just claim not to know how. The tactics come with more cute names, a fair amount of it female-anatomy based: \u201c#PussyPosse\u201d \u201cVagffirmative Action\u201d \u201cReach Clitoral Mass.\u201d There are also drawings; they too are cute.", "All this whimsy is heavy going, and weirdly at odds with the larger message of the book, which is that your femininity isn\u2019t going to get you very far at work\u2014in fact it may be your big problem. If certain male behaviors are entrenched, so are certain female behaviors, and", "is most trenchant when it moves from \u201cKnow the Enemy\u201d to \u201cKnow Yourself.\u201d In other words, maybe it\u2019s not simply that men are sabotaging women; it\u2019s that we\u2019re sabotaging ourselves. We\u2019re constantly asking \u201cAre we good enough?\u201d and answering no. We panic or babble when talking in meetings (\u201cThe Clusterfuck of Speaking While Female,\u201d as Bennett subtitles one chapter). We\u2019re afflicted by typically feminine traits like apologizing, hedging, and excessive use of emojis. Also upspeak. We\u2019re bad at negotiating raises or anything else.", "One way to read this book would be as an anti-femininity manual, and in fact the book\u2019s best advice is to succeed by \u201ccarrying yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man.\u201d Bennett\u2019s example is \u201cJosh,\u201d a former colleague who always seemed to get what he wanted, despite not working very hard or taking anything that seriously. Josh wasn\u2019t an asshole, in fact he was kind of a mensch, but he knew how to put himself first. He knew to grab the seat next to the boss at meetings and schmooze him; he knew how to play the room and jump on the smart ideas; he didn\u2019t give a shit what people thought of him. \u201cWhat would Josh do?\u201d became Bennett\u2019s mantra, especially when she realized that not only were Josh\u2019s instincts the polar opposite of hers, his were working a lot better.", "But Josh is a big picture guy, and a lot of this book is taken up with small bore issues. Bennett understands that with 42 million women in America living on the brink of poverty (the number is hers), some of her concerns sound trivial, but there she is complaining about the AC nonetheless. Believe me, I can outcomplain anyone when it comes to room temperature, though I deeply loathe about myself the ineradicable princess-and-the-pea feminine propensities that leave me far more fixated on the micro-discomforts of heating, lighting, and irritating noise than any man I know. My personal \u201cfight move\u201d is attempting to keep such things in scale, or when that\u2019s not possible, suffering silently.", "Bennett\u2019s lack of attention to scale becomes the default politics of her book. One of her big demands (or \u201casks,\u201d in corporate-speak) turns out to be dedicated lactation rooms in offices, the absence of which leaves nursing women to figure out how and where to pump breast milk at work. No, a supply closet won\u2019t do. The lactation issue comes up repeatedly (avoiding repetition is not this book\u2019s strong suit) and gets many pages, though in fact it\u2019s a battle won, at least formally, as per the 2010 Affordable Care Act, according to which bathrooms can\u2019t serve as lactation rooms either.", "Yet somehow she devotes zero pages to the far larger question: what you\u2019re doing with the kid while you\u2019re pumping at the office. The universal child care \u201cask\u201d gets not a mention, despite the fact that the months of her working life the average woman spends pumping milk make up a minuscule slice compared with the years she\u2019s going to spend raising and tending children.", "Universal child care would change vast numbers of working women\u2019s lives significantly\u2014women of all classes. It would also mean a deep structural overhaul of the rules undergirding the American economy. Nothing would show more real commitment to working women than reallocating resources to child care, to be funded by\u2014as has been proposed\u2014closing corporate tax loopholes. Whereas the \u201cwoman-friendly\u201d workplace measures Bennett supports\u2014flexible hours, parental leave policies (I noted she didn\u2019t say", "leave)\u2014are ones that won\u2019t in any way disrupt the existing distribution of resources. In fact, Bennett tries to sell such measures by citing research indicating that they increase productivity. Here\u2019s the question she doesn\u2019t take up: Where would the benefits of that increased productivity", "?", "Male types to watch out for include the Dismisser, the Bropriator, and the Stenographucker, who treats you like the office secretary.", "Bennett and I clearly get irked about different issues, but here\u2019s something else I find super irritating about the American workplace: those outrageous CEO salaries. Even more than I want the AC turned down, I want caps on off-the-charts CEO compensation. I wondered if maybe resource issues escaped Bennett\u2019s attention because she\u2019s a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of billionaire Facebook exec Sheryl Sandberg, whom she deifies to an embarrassing degree\u2014\u201cSeriously, this woman is good at", "\u201d\u2014and whose best-selling book,", ", Bennett touts to the point of product placement. She even suggests leaving copies of it \u201ccasually placed on the desks of male bosses\u201d as one of her \u201cfight moves.\u201d We learn at the end of the book that Bennett parlayed a casual acquaintance with Sandberg (Bennett had once interviewed her) into a job with LeanIn.org. (The marketing campaign for", "also lists \u201cCross-promotion with LeanIn.org.\u201d) Schmoozing the boss and touting her ideas\u2014I guess this", "what Josh would do.", "I was never able to bring myself to read", "; my feminist heroes wanted to bring down corporate America, not run it. Also I\u2019d read the various critiques faulting Sandberg for her \u201cneo-liberal faux feminism,\u201d meaning\u2014so say her critics\u2014that she touts an ethic of individual responsibility while ignoring structural and racial inequalities. But I have watched Sandberg\u2019s 2010", ", which allegedly sparked", ". Like Bennett, Sandberg has much to say about female self-sabotage, which she laments because female progress to the top echelons has stalled, and \u201ca world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women would be a better world.\u201d", "She never says why. Is Greece less immiserated because Angela Merkel, as one of the most prominent voices in the eurozone crisis, is a woman? Am I supposed to cheer if an anti-choice female candidate gets elected to Congress or because Carly Fiorina got to run Hewlett-Packard? Equality is one thing, and a legitimate demand, but a few millennia of oppression doesn\u2019t mean that if women ran things we\u2019d necessarily do it any better, and to think otherwise is sentimental drivel. Nor does a history of inequality make the dumber elements of feminine culture any less grating than the dumber elements of male culture. Remind me why sports metaphors are somehow worse than nonstop cutesiness again? Reading this book felt like clawing my way through snowdrifts of saccharine. My brain felt gooey afterward. An hour of ESPN would have been like a power cleanse. I found myself wondering who Bennett\u2019s target audience could be, since it seems doubtful that anyone who needs to be told to make lists, take time for herself, and find a mentor\u2014advice so familiar it\u2019s like career gal Muzak by this point\u2014hasn\u2019t already learned all this from", ".", "That\u2019s not to say that the appeal of cutesy feminism to many women is hard to understand, even in a workplace culture that contains the ferociously not-cute sexism of Ailes and his ilk. This book may have sprung from the same impulse that has propelled coinages like", "into the cultural conversation\u2014the push to turn every gender-political issue, no matter how woolly, into a pat little portmanteau that makes for a convenient bloggy shorthand. Women who know that other women crave advice, and that content matters less than form (bullet points, listicles), often go far. Think of Helen Gurley Brown, who built an empire on the relentlessly upbeat message that everything\u2014namely you!\u2014is fixable. I understand the appeal: I too want to be fixed; I too like a little fake uplift now and then. But I also resent, on behalf of my gender, the fact that we apparently need so much fixing.", "Sounds like that book, far from being a slam dunk, fumbled the ball at the line of scrimmage and, unable to recover, suffered a TKO before even making it through the first round, and struck out.", "", "", "", "", "Not unlike Brown,", "wants us to see that femininity can be toughened up, weaponized even.
