Once, they propagated through bookstores like an alien mold; now, the series is more like a dormant monster, sleeping quietly, biding its time.

Adult horror is for kids in adult bodies and children\u2019s horror is for kids in kids\u2019 bodies. The more meaningful difference between the two genres lies in what they do with the boogeymen they conjure up. Frightfests for children tame and temper our fears, while adult horror breaks through our mature defenses to inform us that the monster under the bed is real.", "In", "books, the monster\u2019s powers were so diminished by goofiness and snark that at times it seemed his true role was to initiate you into the lifelong practice of stress management. Skeletons kept losing appendages. Ghosts popped out of the closet with the predictability of a Jack-in-the-box. \u00a0The strange, subtle thing about being a kid, though, was that you never quite trusted Stine\u2019s reassurances. You feared that the playfulness, the safety nets, might vanish in an instant, leaving you alone in the dark. They never did, of course, but the possibility glowed over every page like a will-o-the-wisp.

A ritual that purports to raise the dead is odd and hallucinatory, and the hurricane hits with more-than-natural fury. The biblical names of the twins, Samuel and Daniel, ladle on the cosmic resonance, as does a plague-like blood rain that sweeps down over the first scene like a curtain.

His vision of the fields by moonlight, of pumpkin leaves that \u201cslap against one another\u201d with a sound \u201clike hands clapping,\u201d collapses two meanings of funny: funny-peculiar and funny-ha-ha.
