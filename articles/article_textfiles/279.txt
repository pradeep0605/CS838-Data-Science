{"Body": ["moonbase/amanaimagesRF/Thinkstock", "In the title essay of her ensorcelling anthology", ", Sallie Tisdale observes that \u201cmost writers approach a new story like a boxer circling the ring\u2014with a certain reluctance to engage and break the spell of", ".\u201d Anyone stepping up to review Tisdale\u2019s work faces a similar problem. She catches so many strings and braids so many tones into her mostly autobiographical pieces that you don\u2019t want to diminish her by attempting description. Her dense but light-fingered language holds a dozen wiggling and contradictory ideas in suspension. To enumerate them one by one, as a critic must, feels like bloodying a face or trying to play a symphony on a chainsaw. It feels like plucking all the threads out of a tapestry so that you can no longer see the woven image. It feels\u2014and of course, she\u2019s set us up for this\u2014like violation.", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "Tisdale, a nurse practitioner in Portland, Oregon, has written eight books, the most famous of which,", ", disclosed her \u201cintimate philosophy of sex.\u201d If you haven\u2019t read it, you\u2019re probably getting the wrong idea: Rather than scandalizing readers with throbbing flesh, Tisdale offers a patient, ruminative account of arousal, allowing meaning to accrete in tiny steps.", "is also accretive.

She finds words for the fluid, untrammeled experience of it when it\u2019s working, and for the frustration when it\u2019s not. \u201cI climb slowly up the scaffold of old work, yesterday\u2019s good sentence or two,\u201d she says, nailing it. Or: \u201cI write in bursts\u2014intuitively driven torrents\u2014followed by careful repair.\u201d At one point, she pins down an anguish familiar to anyone who has ever been edited: \u201cI\u2019ve been told \u2026. This isn\u2019t the story you meant to write, this isn\u2019t how your story really ends, this isn\u2019t what you mean to say. I know what a childish grief this is:", "\u201d", "Tisdale knows how. She knows how to tickle the part of the brain that \u201csees\u201d what isn\u2019t visible, like when \u201cwhite metal display cases\u201d in a butcher shop curve away \u201clike the fabric of space.\u201d She hints at the glamour of firefighters, to a child, by summoning the youthful pleasure of onomatopoeia in a siren\u2019s \u201clong whooing call.\u201d \u201cWhen we were done,\u201d she writes of her family\u2019s meat dinners, \u201cour plates were littered with the rags of bones.\u201d At once sensual and erudite, the description alludes to Yeats\u2019 \u201c", ",\u201d where the mute leavings of experience await transformation into art.", "It is an apt place to linger when thinking about Tisdale. Meat, cooked and raw; fire; shadow\u2014these are the totemic images sliding across her curiously dappled prose. In one piece, she cites the philosopher Bachelard on fire\u2019s \u201cphysics of reverie\u201d: the way flickering flames prod the mind to wander. \u201cI still sit cross-legged and dreaming,\u201d she continues, \u201cwatching the hovering flies of light that float before me in a cloud.\u201d If, as Bachelard said, \u201cthat which has been licked by fire has a different taste in the mouths of men,\u201d the life material licked by Tisdale\u2019s imagination and craft also acquires an odd flavor. It ripples; it\u2019s never all one thing. Tisdale favors transitional words like", ", and", "to make sentences quiver with dreamlike mutability; they are always changing and becoming.", "No,", "go shatter the", "of that passage with interpretation. I\u2019ll say instead that Tisdale cares about the moral as well as the technical problems of writing. If fire equals creative imagination, she is the cook applying the flame, watching the flesh change color. In one essay, identifying with meat wrapped in butcher paper, she considers the \u201cdepth of betrayal\u201d entailed by searing and eating animals: \u201cIt feels as if I\u2019m cutting my own flesh \u2026 and that I\u2019ll choke to death upon it, like a prisoner fed his own treacherous, boiled, tongue.\u201d More often, the singed skin belongs to Tisdale\u2019s family members. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t careful,\u201d she concedes, memoir \u201ccan make us into monsters.\u201d", "Prometheus\u2019 theft of fire, the original violation, was a son\u2019s rebellion against his father. Tisdale writes about her firefighter dad, an emotionally distant alcoholic. She incurs her sister\u2019s anger, which she also writes about. One sororal dispute arises after Tisdale publishes a story in which \u201cI describe her at age six as \u2018squeamish, chubby, pale, and black-haired\u2014she\u2019s the one left out, the baby.\u2019 \u201d \u201cI was", ",\u201d Tisdale reports her sister protesting. \u201c", "like", "\u201d So the memoirist returns to a box of photographs and resurrects the one she had in mind. She discovers, she says, a child \u201cpretty and dark with charming bee-stung lips and black hair falling in big, natural curls. She isn\u2019t plump; I was wrong; how could I have remembered it that way?\u201d", "curls? Bee-stung lips? Is this accurate\u2014or is Tisdale, the memoirist, learning her lesson about depictive politesse? But she explains: Originally, \u201cI was wrong and I was right, for this is what I meant by that word [chubby]\u2014fragility\u2026girlish weakness in a world where weakness was lethal.\u201d The false flesh was pressed into conveying a larger truth, one Tisdale continued to stand by. In memoir, what\u2019s provable doesn\u2019t matter and what matters isn\u2019t provable. How do you establish ethical rules for a genre where truth, fact, and fiction interact so unpredictably?", "Tisdale suggests that an autobiographer\u2019s power lies not so much in the details she exposes as in the way her voice and viewpoint color those innocent data points. \u201cNonfiction is never exactly true\u2014the writer\u2019s own perfume lingers on every word, gently and insistently filling the reader\u2019s head with one person\u2019s singular world,\u201d she says.
