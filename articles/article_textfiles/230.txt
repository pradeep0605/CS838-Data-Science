{"Body": ["Still from", "", "First published in 1969, Ronald Blythe\u2019s Akenfield", "is an enormously vivid and affecting portrait of life in one village in the southeast of England, as told through the voices of the farmers, workers, and villagers themselves. Blythe, a novelist who had edited editions of Jane Austen and Thomas Hardy for the Penguin Classics series, chose \u201cAkenfield\u201d as a pseudonym for a village in the East Anglian county of Suffolk, where he had grown up. He spent the winter of 1966\u201367 in what he called \u201ca kind of natural conversation with all three generations\u201d of his neighbors, capturing their thoughts on \u201cfarming, education, welfare, class, religion and indeed life and death.\u201d The best-selling book that resulted captured the changing nature of English rural life, and it has remained in print in England ever since as a Penguin Modern Classic.", "was also greeted enthusiastically in America, receiving rave reviews from John Updike, Paul Fussell, John Leonard, and Jan Morris (then still writing as James)", "Tellingly, many of the reviews hailed", "as \u201ca classic of its kind,\u201d judiciously dodging the question of just what kind of book it might be. The original Penguin edition classified it as \u201cSociology/Anthropology,\u201d which was fitting given its blend of popular ethnography and sociological survey.", "But Blythe saw it less as a work of social science or oral history than as a travel book. He described writing it as \u201cmaking a strange journey to a familiar land,\u201d and like George Orwell\u2019s", "or Alfred Kazin\u2019s", ", Blythe\u2019s grand achievement in", "is fundamentally that of the writer as eyewitness reporter, as traveler with a fresh eye and a great ear for language. These are books that ignore the question of what experience", "and instead burrow deeply, richly into describing experience itself. Their writers are obsessed with the particulars of a place and the lives lived through it, with a time and the lives lived across it. They ask the deepest and most vital question, and answer it as well as any work of art can: What does it", "like to be anyone other than ourselves?", "The place and the people Blythe chose to document in", "couldn\u2019t have been less promising subjects for such a work. \u201cThere is one thing about Suffolk folk,\u201d a sixth-generation East Anglian named Christopher Falconer says in", ", \u201cand that is that they find talk terribly difficult.\u201d", "Blythe himself acknowledged the challenge of what he called \u201cthat famous Suffolk taciturnity,\u201d and he wrote movingly about how easy a village such as Akenfield was to miss:", "As he explained years later, Blythe had been commissioned to write the book jointly by Penguin Books in the United Kingdom and Pantheon Books in the United States, as part of a series on how village life was changing around the world. \u201cWhen they came to me and said I should do Britain, I told them I was not a sociologist remotely, nor had I heard of the term", "at the time.\u201d He had no idea how to get started on the task.", "Blythe spent the next two years cycling around the village on a Raleigh bicycle and talking with its people. \u201cMy only real credentials,\u201d he wrote later, \u201cwas that I was native to its situation in nearly every way and had only to listen to hear my own world talking.\u201d Blythe is an extraordinary listener\u2014patient enough to identify and buttonhole the most interesting sources, garrulous enough to get them to reveal truths beyond the cheerful banalities every reporter hears. As one man in the book says of East Anglians generally: \u201cYou\u2019d hardly call them colorful yet they certainly aren\u2019t grey.\u201d In teasing out the most subtle differences in their experiences and views, Blythe revealed a teeming world in the smallest and barest of places. The experience of reading", "feels like standing before a rich but outwardly inaccessible painting and finding its deepest beauties slowly emerge, both as individual details and as a unified whole. Blythe\u2019s first wish had been to be a painter, after all, and it\u2019s no accident that", "is subtitled", ".", "Tellingly, many of the reviews hailed", "as \u201ca classic of its kind,\u201d judiciously dodging the question of just what kind of book it might be.", "The book is divided into 20 sections, such as \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cThe Forge,\u201d \u201cThe Craftsmen,\u201d and \u201cThe Law,\u201d which introduce some 50 people. We meet women and men, the old and the young, all of them identified simply by age and vocation: There are farm owners and farmworkers, a plowman, a shepherd, orchardmen, teachers and students, a deacon, a group of bell ringers, a blacksmith, a wheelwright, a thatcher, a saddler, a military man, a doctor, a nurse, a vet, a poet, a gravedigger. The book opens with the 71-year-old farmworker Leonard Thompson, in a section called \u201cThe Survivors,\u201d who tells the story of having first left the village for the war in 1914. What the English experienced in the trenches of the western front or, as in Thompson\u2019s case, of Gallipoli, was famously a shock, but even amid the vast and horrifying literature of World War I, there may be few passages more viscerally affecting than Thompson\u2019s:", "There are dozens of passages like this one in", ", moments when a reader is forced to pay closer attention, to notice as much as the people of Akenfield do. As when the thatcher recounts his satisfaction in the look of a finished roof, in which \u201cthe reeds shine silver and grey, and the deep eaves are cut razor-sharp.\u201d Or when the forge worker declares, \u201cI look at everything. I don\u2019t open a church door without looking at the hinges.\u201d Or when the gravedigger insists, \u201cI can always tell if a person is dead by looking at the eyes. I never make a mistake about dead eyes. I see at once when the seeing has gone.\u201d", "The great subject of", ", and the reason it remains such a vital book to read now, even in America, thousands of miles from its milieu, is the ways people grapple with changes in the patterns of life in their own time\u2014whether through social flux, cultural variation, demographic shifts, technological progress, environmental degradation, or some combination. Blythe recognized that under the placid surface of a place as seemingly unchanging as Akenfield lay a clash of virtual tectonic plates, as a class-riven, tradition-bound, nearly feudal community began to erupt and fissure.", "The people of Akenfield express deep reverence for the past and its traditions, and at the same time an overwhelming urge to leave it all behind\u2014and this tension gives", "its distinctive drama.", "Still from", "The villagers describe with palpable regret bits of knowledge that were fast being lost\u2014how to shape a corn-dolly, how to thatch a roof. Their reverential views of the past and its continuity and stability are often moving: \u201cI have a lot of my grandfather\u2019s features,\u201d says the blacksmith. \u201cI have his hands. Hands last a long time, you know. A village sees the same hands century after century. It is a marvellous thing but it\u2019s true.\u201d Their heartfelt faith in an older order and a slower way of doing things, which even in 1966 was disappearing, can sometimes turn comic: \u201cLife now is much less elaborate and, consequently, much less interesting,\u201d says a gardener. \u201c[The newcomers] buy expensive ugly things. Their gardens look like shopping.\u201d And it\u2019s arresting when one of the bell ringers recalls the lost tradition of tolling bells for the death of a fellow villager:", "Yet", "does not bow to sentimental ideas of the countryside as idyll, and even the villagers we might expect to romanticize their work, or to sink into simple nostalgia for the past, take a more complex view of it. They speak candidly of the brutality of country life and of hopes to escape the village. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the old days back,\u201d says one farmworker. \u201cEvery bad thing gets to sound pleasant enough when time has passed. But it wasn\u2019t pleasant then, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d The owner of the harness shop, in recounting for Blythe the traditional way he makes harnesses from horsehide and cowhide\u2014\u201cWe worked the fat in with a bone, just as a soldier bones his boots\u201d\u2014looks back with pride on the quality of his work, but he recognizes the irony. \u201cOur harness lasted for ever, as you might say. It was our downfall, wasn\u2019t it! We made these things so well that after a while they did us out of a living.\u201d", "The people of Akenfield are well aware of their own anachronism, their struggle with time\u2019s passage and the social changes they see all around them. Their refusal to simply accept the prerogatives of the future, to both resist it and want it on their own terms, gives", "a novelistic potency as mournful and wary of the coming of modernity as Sherwood Anderson\u2019s", "or John Williams\u2019s", ". Who doesn\u2019t cheer for the plowman when, describing his solitary vocation, plowing furrow after lonely furrow, he insists that, \u201cIt is surprisingly interesting. The gulls are with me.\u201d", "The book also speaks to a very contemporary yearning in America, as we struggle to retain some connection to the land and pastoral traditions and values as they inevitably get, in the immortal words of Laurie Lee, another great English writer, \u201cbulldozed for speed.\u201d Even the views of gentrification expressed in", "can sound utterly of the moment: \u201cThe blacksmith\u2019s shop in most villages is now either a garage, a smart cottage called The Olde Forge or a forlorn lean-to still redolent of horse musk and iron, its roof gradually slithering down to the couch-grass mat which covers the yard.\u201d", "does not seek to draw a single lesson of meaning from the lives it captures so resonantly. The book\u2019s lasting power lies in the way it takes those lives, which might otherwise be missed or seem too circumscribed to draw in great detail, and renders them fully, richly, memorably. As Blythe later remarked: \u201cI think my view of human life is how brief and curious most people\u2019s lives are. Yet when you come to talk to them you realize how strong they are and how unbelievably rich their lives are; also how subtle and various.\u201d Or as Updike once put it, \u201cPerhaps, as Proust suggested, the transformation of experience by memory into something ineffably precious is the one transcendent meaning each life does wrest from death.\u201d", "In 2004, the writer Craig Taylor was commissioned by", "magazine to return to the village in Suffolk on which", "was based to see how things had changed in the generation since the book appeared. In", ", the acclaimed piece and book that resulted, Taylor described his method: \u201cI sought out locals who had appeared in the original book to see how their lives had changed, and met newcomers to discuss their own views. The thatcher and saddler have disappeared; in their place is the gas station attendant and the commuter,\u201d he wrote. Among the many contemporary residents of Akenfield, Taylor also included an interview with Blythe himself, in which he spoke about what he had seen in Akenfield:", "Ronald Blythe lives today some 20 miles from the village he called Akenfield, in a house that once belonged to John Nash, the painter to whom", "is dedicated. In the nearly half-century since the publication of", ", he has written books about aging, botany, and the poet John Clare, and he contributes a popular column in", "that has been hailed by the", "as \u201cone of the most elegant and thoughtful columns in British journalism.\u201d In an interview with the writer Robert Macfarlane in 2013, Blythe, then 90 years old, confessed that, as ever, he still lives \u201chalf in the present and half in the past.\u201d", "---", "by Ronald Blythe.
