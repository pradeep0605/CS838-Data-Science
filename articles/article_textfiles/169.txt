{"Body": ["Photo courtesy Wikipedia", "In the belly of the high school where I work is the book room. It is dusty and cluttered, a catch-all for the many shipments the school receives. Lining the walls, stacked to the ceiling, are textbooks, workbooks, and novels. I\u2019m an English teacher, so it\u2019s the novels that call to me. The books are old, with broken spines and taped covers. One that stands out is", "These copies of Sylvia Plath\u2019s first and only novel have traveled in backpacks and bags, through fights with parents and questions about the future, through blossoming and broken relationships, through acceptances and rejections from colleges, from the early \u201990s when they were purchased to today.", "I remember receiving one of these copies when I was a student at the same school. Though it has largely become part of the high school canon, it existed in stark opposition to many of its counterparts. Mental illness is discussed in frank and graphic terms, and for many students, it is a text that stays with them in some way\u2014either through a connection to the character or their inability to understand her point of view. Plath\u2019s Esther Greenwood is candid and vulnerable, and though it was written 50 years ago, its emotional core still rings true.

It is a semester-long study of a single author, and Jam along with her four classmates have been given old red leather journals by their teacher, Mrs. Quenell. They\u2019re told to write in the journals twice a week and hand them in on the last day of class. This semester they will be studying the works of Sylvia Plath.", "Jam is reluctant to begin her journaling assignment, \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing I want to write. I\u2019m hardly going to put down on paper the things I think about all the time, night and day. The person I think about. That\u2019s only for me.\u201d When Jam finally begins her assignment, she is shaken and confused, along with the other students in her class. But when she writes, \u201cReeve Maxfield was the person I\u2019d been waiting to meet since I was born, but of course I didn\u2019t know it,\u201d she enters a trancelike state in which her past is restored and Reeve is alive again. When she comes to, five pages have been filled in her journal, but she has no memory of writing beyond the first sentence. Initially cautious, the other members of her class begin to reveal that they have also had the same experience: a few sentences written, and then a link back to their pasts before their lives became undone.", "Wolitzer understands that there are many kinds of trauma. Is a divorce as bad as a death? Does it matter?", "This motley group begins to meet in secret, breaking the strict rules of their school. Together, they talk to one another and slowly share their reasons for being sent to the Wooden Barn. There is Casey, a rich girl from New York City who has used a wheelchair since an accident. Sierra, a young dancer trying to cope with the kidnapping of her younger brother. Marc, who\u2019s discovered a secret that will unravel his family. And Griffin, a sullen and reticent boy from a nearby farm who holds his trauma close. Our narrator Jam is controlled in her telling, keeping a few select moments of her time with Reeve at the forefront of her mind, while maintaining an air of secrecy with the group.", "In between visits to \u201cBelzhar,\u201d their code for this shared experience through journaling, the students continue to read the works of Sylvia Plath. In", ", Plath\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes her isolation: \u201c[W]herever I sat\u2014on the deck of a ship or at a street cafe in Paris or Bangkok\u2014I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.\u201d When Mrs. Quenell asks the students in Special Topics if any of them is able to relate to", ", Casey describes herself as \u201ctrapped in my own little bell jar on wheels.\u201d Jam makes the connection as well, and soon the entire class is engrossed in the conversation. But what are they really talking about: the text or their own lives?", "Photo by Nina Subin", "Though the story of Esther Greenwood is highly autobiographical, Wolitzer understands that there are many kinds of trauma. Jam explains, \u201cWhat the character of Esther Greenwood feels, I feel too. The other students in Special Topics probably would agree, even though everyone\u2019s problems are really different.\u201d When they finally begin to reveal their secrets to one another, the classmates start to rank their problems. Is a divorce as bad as a death? Does it matter? When Marc begins to make light of his own experience, explaining it away as not as hurtful or traumatic as what some of the others have been through, Casey makes a point that might seem simplistic to some adult readers but will be important to teens: \u201cBut it\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to", ".\u201d", "As the semester continues, the students begin to realize the implication of their journals. While for now they are relishing their previous lives, stuck in a past that has yet to betray them, they will soon run out of pages.

Eventually, and with time, these students will have to choose a future distinct from their past in \u201cBelzhar,\u201d where time is frozen. They are at the beginnings of their lives, and the option that Mrs. Quenell holds before them is facing the past and moving forward.", "Jam Gallahue muses that even as STEM fields are valued above the humanities, words and literature still matter. In portraying a group of troubled teens who find solace in a novel and a journal, Wolitzer is agreeing. In this respect they mirror Esther Greenwood herself, when Buddy Willard tells her that the poems she so valued were merely dust. \u201cPeople were made of nothing so much as dust,\u201d Plath writes, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t see that doctoring all that dust was a bit better than writing poems people would remember and repeat to themselves when they were unhappy or sick and couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d", "While Sylvia Plath also kept incredibly detailed journals about her life, she is famous for obsessing over the red leather thesaurus that once belonged to her father.
