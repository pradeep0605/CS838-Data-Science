{"Body": ["It\u2019s remarkable that until the beginning of the 21", "century, the drama of mothers and daughters remained relatively unexplored in literature. Plenty of memorable mothers populate novels and plays, from Medea to Proust\u2019s Maman, but writing about filial relations between women is thin on the ground. One can attribute this mostly to the fact that it was men who were doing the scribbling for so long, while the best women writers, like the Brontes and Austen, often steered clear of the subject; the literature of motherhood that did exist was largely sentimental. In the 20", "century, Virginia Woolf (in her essays) and Sylvia Plath (in \u201cMorning Song\u201d) began to make great work out of the ambivalent intensities of mother-daughter relations, which, after all, are rife with dramatic possibility. Even today, though, mothers and daughters feel like the New World of literature\u2014a realm barely explored, waiting for its Westward expansion.", "Alison Bechdel\u2019s new \u201ccomic drama\u201d", "sets out to examine the cartoonist\u2019s relationship with her mother; not coincidentally, it ends up exploring a host of big topics, including the nature of emotional attachment and the idea of the \u201cself.\u201d", "is a sequel of sorts to", ", Bechdel\u2019s best-selling 2006 graphic memoir about her father, and like that book is ambitious, superbly funny, and hauntingly searching. But it\u2019s less a portrait than a meta-memoir about trying and failing to write anything coherent about her mother. Near the start of the book, Bechdel observes that \u201cthe real problem with this memoir about my mother is that it has no beginning.\u201d She adds, \u201cThe story of my mother and me is unfolding even as I write it.\u201d No beginning, and no ending\u2014it doesn\u2019t bode well. But for most of us a mother is a story with neither beginning nor end, it turns out, and so this peculiarity is part of the strange power of this singular book.", "is a kind of M\u00f6bius strip, circling back and forward in time, and never quite coming to a conclusion. Describing it won\u2019t capture the experience of reading it in the least. That\u2019s not just because so many of the effects are generated by Bechdel\u2019s painstaking, expressive drawings, which convey her anxious, poignant ethos more than any words can. Anyone who read", "or her comic strip", "will recognize Bechdel\u2019s astringent wit and her warmth: Her work is both bracingly skeptical and highly open to, its own emotional vibrations. She\u2019s not so much wise-cracking as quiet-cracking. This is a deeply internal book; the main characters are Bechdel and her mother, but Virginia Woolf, the child psychiatrist Donald Winnicott, and Alice Miller, the author of", ", play equally significant roles in the unfolding emotional narrative. So do two of Bechdel\u2019s therapists, Jocelyn and Carol.", "Divided into seven sections\u2014each named after a key concept of Winnicott\u2019s theories of infant development\u2014", "flouts writing-school rules. It lengthily recounts Bechdel\u2019s dreams and her therapy sessions, which revolve around what it was like to live with parents who were narcissistically self-involved. More startlingly, Bechdel tells us that as she writes chapters, she gives them to her mother, Helen, for comment. Then she writes about what her mother says, or, more tellingly,", "say. In one of the very first scenes in the book, Alison and Helen are talking on the phone when Helen rather passive-aggressively praises a", "article about the narcissism of memoir-writing (\u201cIsn\u2019t he the one who beat you for that prize?\u201d she asks, of the author), and Bechdel reflects on her \u201cfear that Mom will find this memoir about her \u2018angry.\u2019 \u201d The stakes are all laid out, if implicitly: The daughter\u2019s never-ending desire for the mother\u2019s approval, on the one hand, and her recognition, on the other, of the mother\u2019s failures and limitations, on the other. (Perhaps most painfully, Helen has never accepted her daughter\u2019s lesbianism.)", "So the core drama of", "? is a resoundingly psychological one: The child who is hurt by her own wounded mother, and whose grown-up romantic relationships mirror this difficulty with intimacy. It\u2019s hard to alchemize therapeutic language and modes of thinking into true literary drama, but the first half of", "is wonderful, a fresh, funny, and poignant exploration not just of Bechdel\u2019s relationship with her mother, but of the nature of attachment itself. Writing the book, Bechdel became interested in the work of psychologists who study childhood trauma. It was Winnicott who invented the famous idea of the \u201cgood-enough mother,\u201d who enables her child to survive psychically intact by modeling responsiveness and functional mirroring: If you smile I\u2019ll smile. What Winnicott\u2014and Bechdel\u2014was interested in was what happened when this crucial mother-child mirroring broke down, and the child became precociously attuned to the mother\u2019s needs instead of her own. Likewise, Alice Miller\u2019s", "chronicles the kinds of abuse children suffer at the hands of narcissistic parents, particularly mothers.", "is as much about reading them and Woolf as it is about Helen Bechdel; it\u2019s this triangulating, filtered through the additional artifice of hand-drawn images, that gives the book much of its charge.", "In", ", Bechdel\u2019s mother was portrayed as an unhappy woman with thwarted artistic tendencies\u2014an actress and avid reader, an erstwhile poet.", "fleshes out that image. Aspiring actress Helen Fontana left college to study at the Cleveland Play House. Returning home to finish school, she met Bruce Bechdel, who had ambitions to be an artist and live in Europe. Instead the couple got married and, less than a year later, had Alison. They settled down in rural Pennsylvania to what appears to have been long lives of thwarted ambitions and painful secrets. For two people with artistic longings, they were utterly trapped by the conventional masks society told them they should wear. Bruce, it turned out, was a closeted homosexual. He reacted to the news that Helen was pregnant with \u201cinappropriate laughter,\u201d which deeply upset her.", "The wounds that Helen suffered led to a kind of emotional withdrawal. In this family, nothing was spoken about openly. Helen stopped kissing Alison goodnight when she was 7 years old, after finding a picture the young Bechdel drew of a doctor examining a little girl\u2019s \u201ctee-tee place.\u201d On another night, Helen, watching", "alone, asks the young Alison, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d Although she\u2019s a frustrated artist herself, she wants Bechdel not to write her stories as memoir, so that the neighbors won\u2019t talk about their family and its problems (meaning homosexuality, one supposes). She doesn\u2019t seem to understand how much of the problem she is\u2014and yet one feels a sneaking empathy toward her: Whatever else she may be, she is also a victim of her era, a woman who might have led a different (and much happier) life had she been born 30 years later.", "is animated by the idea that it is our wounds that make us artists. In the hands of another writer, this might feel schematic, but Bechdel is temperamentally averse to the touchy-feely (she has never understood the point of hugs, she writes). In her early career, Bechdel sent her mother an essay she\u2019d written about the fact that her mother never touched her. She asked, \u201cDo you remember this?\u201d The essay was returned covered in red ink, with suggestions to use stronger verbs and fewer adverbs. Helen did not say whether she did or didn't remember this, but allowed that perhaps she marked up the essay so heavily because she was \u201cjealous because you are writing and I am not.\u201d", "One of the most poignant elements of this book is the way Bechdel quietly draws out (without too much explicit commentary) all the ways that she and her mother are as alike as they are unalike. Bechdel\u2019s mother obsessively reads about Sylvia Plath and wishes she \u201chad been Helen Vendler,\u201d the poetry critic and Harvard professor. Bechdel obsessively reads Woolf, who was herself preoccupied with the early death of her mother, and her father\u2019s cool distance. Both turn to art to escape from and to understand themselves. One has made a career of it; the other\u2019s drive to do so was thwarted. (Bechdel wakes from a particularly vivid dream of her mother with the words \u201cthwart,\u201d \u201cdrive,\u201d and \u201claden\u201d in her mind. She concludes that these words apply to her, but they seem far more applicable to her mother.)", "A mother is our first attachment. So powerful is the connection, psychiatrists like Winnicott posit, that at first we don\u2019t believe she is an \u201cother\u201d at all. Then one terrible day we grasp that we are not the creators of our own world, that the breast (or bottle) doesn\u2019t magically appear just because we want it. And so, Winnicott believes, at some point the child has to \u201cdestroy\u201d the mother and witness the mother\u2019s survival of that destruction in order to venture out safely and securely into her own life. To the extent that there\u2019s a journey in", ", it\u2019s that Bechdel has, in Winnicott\u2019s terms, destroyed the mother\u2014by writing the book the mother doesn\u2019t want her to write; by giving voice to all the ways that mother failed rather than succeeded\u2014and the mother has survived the destruction, continuing to talk to her daughter, even offering grudging praise (\u201cWell, it coheres\u201d) for the result.", ", like", "it\u2019s named after, is more about", "for that secure attachment than anything else.", "This is why all those meta-moments have to be written into the book: We must witness the mother\u2019s initial observations that the book has too many strands, her wariness of the entire project, so that when she finally tells Alison that the book is good we understand this to be no small emotional victory. Helen also reads Alison a quote from Dorothy Gallagher about the fact that the memoirist has to serve her story, not her family. \u201cFamily be damned!\u201d Helen cackles, and Alison does, in response. Mirroring\u2014at last.", "If the final third of the book isn\u2019t quite as satisfying as the opening, it\u2019s a predictable decline. The problem of using a therapeutic vocabulary is that it calls for a therapeutic ending, which", "delivers. But it doesn\u2019t matter that much, because even when Bechdel\u2019s storytelling falls short, her drawings retain the ability to move and surprise us. There\u2019s a beautiful, indelible cartoon in the middle of", "that crystallizes how ornately a vulnerable child can create layers of self-protection, as Bechdel herself ornately weaves together the layers of texts that haunt her. Bechdel has been describing a childhood pleasure of building a secret, private \u201coffice\u201d for herself, like a fort. She remembers seeing a \u201cKeep Out\u201d sign somewhere in Dr. Seuss, and, finding the image in Seuss\u2019s", ", is struck by how much the domicile on which the sign hangs resembles a mother\u2019s womb. It\u2019s as if her own forts are her attempts to become the author of her own security\u2014a self-sufficient womb.", "\u201cI would barricade myself off in the back of a closet or a corner of the dining room and work there on my drawings,\u201d Bechdel writes alongside this evocative image, reproducing Seuss. (Both writers have an extraordinary feel for the inner selves of children.) \u201cThe sensation of being invisible, inviolable, was a kind of ecstasy.\u201d All the infant wants\u2014indeed all anyone wants\u2014is, as Winnicott wrote, to", ", without disruption. It was in mirroring her parents\u2019 own figurative \u201cKeep Out\u201d signs that the young Bechdel felt safest, and it\u2019s hardly a surprise that she should become an artist herself. By inventing a fresh visual vocabulary for familiar psychological concepts, Bechdel\u2019s books remind us that good memoirs are not just about witness; they are as much about the art of memory as the fact of it.", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
