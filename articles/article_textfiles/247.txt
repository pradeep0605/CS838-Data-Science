Bring on the prickly, the strange, the cruel, the self-destructive! I don\u2019t read books to make friends.", "Ruth Graham is a regular", "contributor. She lives in New Hampshire.", "", "But", "the debut novel by poet Jill Alexander Essbaum, challenged my stance on the issue. The novel\u2019s heroine is exhausting. An American woman married to a wealthy, dashing, faithful Swiss man, Anna Benz has three beautiful children, an elegant house near Z\u00fcrich, no need to work, and a mother-in-law who babysits on demand. She is stylish and slim. Handsome, interesting men flirt with her seemingly everywhere she goes. Naturally, she is miserable.", "There is a problem, you see: Anna is a wife and mother in a novel, and therefore she suffers from the generalized ennui that is a longtime epidemic among her peers in Western literature. Sadly, Anna is only \u201cmore or less\u201d in love with her banker husband, Bruno. She doesn\u2019t have many friends, seemingly by choice. She doesn\u2019t like springtime, because she is \u201csaddened by flux.\u201d After nine years in Switzerland, she is only beginning to make a real effort to learn to speak German. Poor Anna! And so, without much agonizing, she has entered into a series of lusty affairs that present themselves to her almost every time she leaves the house.", "Anna and her fellow heirs of Madame Bovary suggest that 21", "-century marriage and motherhood are just as miserable as the 19", "-century version.", "Bad choices make for good plots. But there\u2019s something about Anna that is not only unsympathetic, but unconvincing. Other than a past interest in sewing, she doesn\u2019t seem to have any hobbies. She doesn\u2019t read. She doesn\u2019t follow the news, or spend any time online. She takes long walks and thinks things like \u201cShame\u2019s the shadow of love.\u201d She is prone to on-the-nose symbolic gestures like tossing her cellphone in the Limmat River and riding the train for hours on a whim.", "Then again,", "itself is prone to on-the-nose symbolism. Not only is one of Anna\u2019s lovers a \u201cpyrologist,\u201d but the novel wields a blowtorch to draw attention to the deeper connotations of his job: \u201cAn ordinary flame\u2019s hottest point cannot always be seen,\u201d and so on (and on). Anna\u2019s idea of pillow talk with her pyrologist is to murmur things like, \u201cTell me about spontaneous human combustion.\u201d Another time, as her husband lies smiling beside her in the glow of a fading orgasm, she whispers, \u201cBruno, what is the purpose of pain?\u201d Do real people, even depressed expats, really talk this way?", "Nonetheless, I found myself staying up late with", "and lingering in bed in the morning to pick up where I left off. Somehow the novel as a whole is as propulsive as Anna is listless. Watching a car crash\u2014even an infuriatingly avoidable one\u2014is reliably irresistible, and Anna\u2019s Z\u00fcrich is a wonderfully specific place. And although Anna doesn\u2019t seem to particularly enjoy all the athletic sex she\u2019s having with her generous lovers, Essbaum is very good at writing about it. So I was eager to keep reading", "even as I frequently wanted to slap the", "in the", ".", "This is a novel about an unfaithful wife named Anna who is drawn to trains, and so the comparisons to a certain 19", "-century Russian novel are unavoidable. But those similarities only serve to illustrate the much-discussed difficulties of the \u201cmarriage plot\u201d in the age of female emancipation. Anna Karenina is truly stuck: Financially, legally, socially, she cannot escape Karenin. Anna Benz, on the other hand, is free to do just about anything she wants.

When an early passage ends with the statement \u201cAnna didn\u2019t even have a bank account,\u201d it might as well be set to an ominous \u201cdun dun DUN.\u201d But why doesn\u2019t she ... get a bank account? Or a driver\u2019s license? Or a therapist, instead of her Jungian psychoanalyst? Or a divorce? Emotional difficulties would ensue, to be sure, but her present emotional difficulties are already apparently crushing.", "Photo by Megan Sembera Peters", "And what exactly are those emotional difficulties? Bruno is cold and disengaged; I would not want to be married to him. But he is a good father and a reasonable man. It\u2019s never clear why Anna can\u2019t be frank with him about her unhappiness. Instead she mopes around resenting him and pitying herself. One morning, after a night of mutually orgasmic love-making, she spirals into desolation when he gently rebuffs her overture for a second round at the breakfast table. \u201cThe brief vacation from heartbreak made the desolation that remained all the more acute.\u201d", "There is no mention of Anna ever having had a career back in America, and no suggestion that she has considered working in Z\u00fcrich. Child care does not seem to be an obstacle. The Benzes are well-off, and anyway, her mother-in-law watches her children while Anna traipses to German class and then roams the city pursuing her affairs.", "I would argue none of this would be so annoying if Essbaum would simply wink at her readers and let us know that we are meant to be rolling our eyes at least once in a while. In a flash of rare straightforwardness, her analyst tells Anna, \u201cYou move like a refugee in a war ghetto when, truly, you have every Allied power at your command. There is no reason to live like this.\u201d But the moment passes, and soon we are submerged again in Anna\u2019s passivity and misery, and apparently expected to take it very, very seriously.", "Happy families, and happy people, get a bad rap.
