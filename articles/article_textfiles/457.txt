It is a ritual. It is one I have taken every time I have visited London. I have walked it in snow and sleet, in rain and cold, in burning hot drought, and, most often, on perfect spring or autumn days. I have walked it fifty times with a hundred friends, and I am not half through with it yet.\u201d", "This is why, on a recent Tuesday morning, I found myself cursing Roger Ebert from the heart of", ", an expansive public park in north London.

His professor Daniel Curley was also in London, on sabbatical, and the two met up. Curley led Ebert on a stroll through Hampstead Heath. The Perfect Walk was born.", "A few years later, on another trip to London, Ebert bought a copy of the guidebook", "from a bookstand in Leicester Square.

Henry Togna Jr., son of that owner, had taken over from his father a few years before the hotel was shuttered. I recently met him at a private club near Hyde Park, where I was ushered into a remarkably upholstered drawing room by a receptionist in a scarlet dress. Togna and I talked about Ebert over stiff drinks (at noon).", "Togna explained that his relationship with Ebert grew tense when he decided to renovate his father\u2019s hotel. Ebert had grown attached to its crumbling charm. At one point, midway through the renovations, Ebert stopped by to examine the construction firsthand. In particularly, he was keen to see the new bathtubs. \u201cHe wanted to check out if he would fit if the tub!\u201d Togna remembered. \u201cHe was quite chunky at the time \u2026 but he slipped right in.

(Tea either way, of course: Ebert always preferred a Lapsang Souchong.) Exhausted, I set off for my less literary East London abode.", "A few weeks later, I spoke with Ebert\u2019s widow Chaz on the phone. We talked about the Perfect Walk, which Chaz has taken many times.

Maybe I\u2019ll sprinkle a few of Roger\u2019s ashes along the way.\u201d", "Photo by John Prieto/the", "/Getty Images", "In his sickest days, Ebert wrote, when he was too frail for cross-Atlantic travel, \u201cI started walking around this London in my mind.\u201d Mentally, he\u2019d start out in his hotel lobby, before turning down Jermyn Street. His first stop would be at Wiltons, where he would order \u201croast turkey with fresh peaches, and raspberry syllabub for dessert.\u201d Roger Ebert, unable to make it to London, imagined London; unable to eat, his jaw gone, he imagined what he\u2019d devour. For, after all, he needed to be fortified for the day of walking ahead.", "In the end, the Perfect Walk is something much more than a stroll. In his memoir, Ebert reflected on his habit of taking the same walks over and over. \u201cThese rituals are important to me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have many places where I sit and think, \u2018I have been here before, I am here now, and I will be here again.\u2019 \u201d", "Throughout Ebert\u2019s writing, the act of walking without purpose acquires a certain religiosity. In this vein, the Perfect London Walk functions like a pilgrimage, a trip to be repeated over and over, step by step. And always at a pace that befits reflection: \u201cI was not a fast walker,\u201d Ebert said, \u201cbut I was steady. Walk too fast and you miss the show. I doodled. Dawdled. Moseyed. Sat down and thought.\u00a0 Gazed into space.\u201d To take Ebert\u2019s walk just once is not to experience it in full. Take it enough times that you lose yourself in it, even while walking the path. If you can\u2019t make it to London, find your own perfect walk in the perfect place you love the most. At the end, at the moment when you are too tired to go on, stop for tea.", "---", "by Roger Ebert and Daniel Curley.
