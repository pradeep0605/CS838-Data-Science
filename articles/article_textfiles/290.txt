She lives in New Hampshire.", "", "But small-girlhood wasn\u2019t Cleary\u2019s only concern. Four mostly forgotten novels she wrote a half-century ago depict teenage life as acutely as the Ramona series dissected childhood. They are also an intriguing time capsule of teen culture in the 1950s and early \u201960s. The quartet deserves its own moment in this season of praise for Cleary\u2019s important body of work.", ",", ", and", "are all set in California, where Cleary settled as an adult after a childhood in Oregon. They feature high-school girls in middle-class families, and their plots revolve around the agony and ecstasy of teen romance. (The HarperTrophy imprint of HarperCollins packaged them a few years ago as the \u201cFirst Love\u201d series, though the books stand independently and can be read in any order.) On the surface, the stakes are adorably low from a 21", "-century adult\u2019s perspective. Will a boy\u2019s father let him borrow the car? Will the girl\u2019s parents allow her to ride in it?", "To use the lingo of their era, these novels are square. The protagonists have names like Jane and Barbara; they are not the misfits of which much teen literature is made but instead fundamentally good girls who long to fit in, and usually do. When Shelley of", "starts her junior year at a new school, she sets her sights on a handsome basketball player, and he quickly asks her out. Jean of", "gamely describes herself as someone who would rather be a part of the cheering crowd than a rally girl out in front. It certainly never occurs to her to stay home from the game. Viewed through the lens of contemporary culture, and especially contemporary teen lit, these girls should be boring and shallow. But Cleary\u2019s supposedly ordinary girls are complex: resentful of their mothers one moment and sympathetic toward them the next, willing to do anything for one special boy but indignant when they\u2019re taken for granted.", "Readers who return to the Ramona books as parents might be surprised at the extent to which seemingly adult woes about money are a steady source of tension in the Quimby household. Similar anxieties animate Cleary\u2019s teen novels, too. In", "the Jarrett family seems to be clinging to the middle class by the skin of their teeth: Jean\u2019s mother works at a downscale fabric store on the weekends, buys the wrong (that is, cheap) kind of milk and butter, and in her spare time enters contests to try to win a new refrigerator or television set. Johnny, by contrast, wears shirts that need to be dry-cleaned. In", ", Jane is relieved to hear that her crush\u2019s family lives on Poppy Lane: \u201cThat meant they were neither very rich nor very poor,\u201d she thinks to herself. If you grow up in a home in which these kinds of worries hum in the background of everyday life\u2014and Cleary did, according to her memoir", "the attention to them never fully vanishes.", "I read several of these books as a preteen, returning over and over to", "in particular. In my memory, the book was thrilling\u2014sexy, even, though my prudish 11-year-old self would have been mortified by the very word. Johnny is a rakish upperclassman who takes an interest in a 15-year-old who wears glasses and sews her own clothes. When Johnny unexpectedly asks her to dance with him, Jean careens between rapture and humiliation. Cleary spends 20 pages on Jean\u2019s methodical preparations for a planned Saturday-evening Johnny visit: moving houseplants, making dessert, rehearsing some casual bits of flirtation. The tension is like something out of Ferrante or Chekhov. When he calls almost an hour late to tell her can\u2019t come after all, it\u2019s devastating.", "When I was a girl, Johnny\u2019s attention to mousy Jean seemed thrilling; as an adult, he comes with so many red flags he might as well be selling them. At the end of the book, Jean rejects him just as his attentions are drifting away anyway. This is a running theme in all four books: Better to like an interesting boy who actually likes you back than to waste time pining after one who, like Johnny, is both too good and not good enough.", "Teen culture changes much faster than kid culture does, so Jean and Johnny\u2019s story feels much more dated now than, say, Ramona\u2019s. I don\u2019t remember being aware as a child that Ramona was \u201cborn\u201d in the 1950s, because her world was so similar to my own. But the fashion, foods, and family dilemmas in the First Love books are unmistakably dated. The protagonists have hobbies like sewing and flower arranging. Their love interests call them on the telephone, take them to formal dances, and ask them to wear their identification bracelets as a symbol of commitment. In 2016, these books read like historical fiction, which may have contributed to their lapse into relative obscurity.", "Another thing that\u2019s dated, or perhaps just tailored for preteen readers: No physical relationship in the books proceeds past a single kiss. But who needs kissing scenes when you\u2019ve got erotic passages like the one where Johnny walks right up to Jean\u2019s desk in the sewing classroom, looks straight down at her, puts his hand on her elbow, leads her out to the hall in front of all her classmates, and then softly whispers, \u201cDid I ever tell you you have a cute little nose?\u201d The first time something like that happens to you, it\u2019s as physically overwhelming as anything that comes along later. Though Cleary doesn\u2019t spell out the girls\u2019 longings\u2014these were the pre-Blume years, after all\u2014she nonetheless captures the electrical charges of the years between puberty and sex.", "Cleary\u2019s protagonists may be chaste, but emotionally they are downright slatternly. These girls treat their teen romances like the ephemeral fancies they are. Three of the four books end with a girl who is happily unencumbered, sometimes dating multiple boys at once. In", ", Shelley has a giddy epiphany that she has fallen in love\u2014\u201cnot the love-for-keeps that would come later, but love that was real and true just the same.\u201d Then she promptly moves out of town, wistful about leaving the boy behind but without entertaining the notion that she would do anything else. The book ends with Shelley alone, \u201chappier than she had ever been in her life.\u201d Cleary treats teenagers with the mix of empathy and clarity she applies to all her young characters: She takes their feelings seriously, but she is also frank about the impermanence of their dramas. The fact that she lets them cheerfully arrive at the same conclusion themselves is downright refreshing.", "I loved Ramona books when I was a little girl in the 70's, and my daughter loved them when she was a little girl, in the mid-2000's!
