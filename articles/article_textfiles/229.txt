{"Body": ["Photo by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders", "Charm\u2014native sparkle, powered by sweatless hard work\u2014is Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s great talent. She\u2019s a writer who transforms \u201clikable\u201d from faint praise into a form of virtuosity: She never takes her eye off her audience. And while \u201cbest-selling author of", "\u201d will probably remain her epithet (and \u201cplayed by Julia Roberts\u201d a good summary of her pop-culture triumph), a more revealing entry in her bibliography might be the", "\u201cThe Muse of the Coyote Ugly Saloon.\u201d", "She\u2019s a writer who transforms \u201clikable\u201d from faint praise into a form of virtuosity.", "A story that also begat a movie, albeit not one with Julia Roberts, the piece describes Gilbert\u2019s early-20s stint tending bar at a dive in the East Village. \u201cI was to lure people into that place, keep them there as long as I could and make damn sure they came back the next week,\u201d she writes. In effect, the job\u2019s mandate was to make customers fall in love with their bartender. Gilbert was a quick study. She worked up her different routines\u2014she could be the sympathetic ear, the ball-busting wit, the \u201990s Mae West\u2014and learned to determine which a given customer required. \u201cI wasn't the prettiest bartender at the Coyote Ugly Saloon, but I was damn sure the best talker,\u201d she writes. \u201cI wasn't the belle of the ball; I was the bouncing ball. You all looked to me.\u201d The \u201cyou\u201d she addresses throughout the piece is her barfly target, but it\u2019s also her reader.", "Gilbert started her career bartending, waiting tables, and working as a cowgirl trail cook before becoming a journalist. Early on, writing for magazines like", "and", "subsidized her fiction. The short story collection", ", her first book, came out in 1997; her first novel,", ", followed in 2000.", "a work of reporting that was a finalist for the National Book Award,", "came out in 2002. And then, in 2006, she published", "In her new book,", ", Gilbert describes her motley post-college jobs as a chance to gather material for her fiction. But they also taught her how to chat up anyone, and this is the ability that made", "such a massive success. Throughout her wish-fulfillment spiritual travelogue, Gilbert displays an almost magical tendency to acquire new friends. And, more importantly\u2014freed from the demands of creating fictional characters or conveying reporting\u2014she can unleash that same charm nonstop upon the reader. The premise of a messily broken heart cured through exotic travel has the alchemy of being both \u201crelatable\u201d and \u201caspirational\u201d; her style is chatty, smart, warm, and light. Over the course of a 300-page book, she sustains the rhetorical energy of a magazine writer hoping to jolly half-attentive airport readers into following her story past the jump. Surely reading about the stuff some stranger saw while meditating ought to be approximately as appealing as hearing about that stranger\u2019s dreams, yet Gilbert takes the most perilously self-indulgent of topics (meals eaten, yoga done, the niceness of a new boyfriend) and makes them engaging.", "After", "Gilbert had a multitude of fans who wanted to befriend her or be her or follow her, and so her subsequent work has found her grappling with the question of what to write when charm has succeeded maybe too well.", "her 2010 memoir interwoven with a history of marriage, found her politely declining to be paralyzed by high expectations\u2014it was a focused, personal attempt to confront the aftermath of her own happy ending.", "a big novel about a 19", "-century female botanist, was a reminder of the pre-Oprah career she\u2019d had as a well-regarded fiction writer.", "And now", "is a swoon into her status as a guru. It\u2019s billed as a guide to \u201ccreative living beyond fear,\u201d and to get a sense of what that means, you could read the jacket copy, or else you could read the acknowledgments page, where both TED and Etsy are thanked. An artifact of the \u201cdo what you love\u201d style of discussing work, fulfillment, and self-empowerment, the book speaks to a moment when the boundaries of creativity appear ever more porous\u2014when tech \u201cmakers\u201d and needle-pointers and brand strategists and avid Instagrammers as well as novelists might all self-identify as \u201ccreative types.\u201d", "The book\u2019s six chapters\u2014\u201cCourage,\u201d \u201cEnchantment,\u201d \u201cPermission,\u201d \u201cPersistence,\u201d \u201cTrust,\u201d \u201cDivinity\u201d\u2014each represent one of Gilbert\u2019s precepts for creative living. The distinctions among them sometimes blur: The imperative to work with \u201cstubborn gladness\u201d seems like it could be a sign of persistence or enchantment, but it\u2019s introduced in \u201cCourage\u201d and discussed at greater length in \u201cTrust.\u201d Bite-sized subsections make up each chapter, a collection of pep talks (\u201cLighten Up\u201d), personal anecdotes (\u201cAn Idea Grows\u201d), and illustrative digressions (\u201cWerner Herzog Chimes In\u201d) that all deliver Gilbert\u2019s blend of energetic optimism and energetic practicality. The effect is not quite padded but it is sort of puffy\u2014pages worth of exhortation held aloft by constant motion and wide line spacing.", "What constitutes creative activity, per Gilbert? It\u2019s the pursuit of \u201cburied treasure,\u201d of the \u201cstrange jewels\u201d that the universe hides \u201cdeep within us all.\u201d This hunt is both transcendent\u2014\u201csomething that takes us out of our established and limiting roles in society\u201d\u2014and playful. Gilbert writes:", "While much of the advice is structured around her own experience as a professional writer, she offers up one friend\u2019s decision to start ice-skating as a prime example of creative living. \u201cIf you\u2019re alive, you\u2019re a creative person,\u201d Gilbert writes. \u201cThe guardians of high culture will try to convince you that the arts belong only to a chosen few, but they are wrong and they are also annoying.\u201d", "What could be a more charming appeal to worshipful fans than the assurance that they\u2019re fundamentally the same as their hero? (Gilbert briefly entertains the question of whether talent matters, coming down unpersuasively on the side of", ".) Just as she determined that Coyote Ugly regulars wanted a bourbon-drinking flirt with a dirty mouth, she seems to have concluded that", "acolytes want a cheery, self-deprecating life coach who takes their hobbies seriously. And the prose here is as personable as ever: Gilbert breaks off long paragraphs for one-line interjections; she acknowledges when things might sound corny or contradictory; she prefaces her reflections with", "; she addresses her readers as \u201cPeople!\u201d", "She maintains this voice even when putting forth concepts that are a bit of a hard sell. In addition to the talk of strange jewels, the philosophy outlined in", "holds that ideas are their own independent entities, floating through the universe in search of human hosts to give them expression. This schema gives Gilbert occasion to address them\u2014the ideas\u2014directly, e.g., \u201cI\u2019m honored by your visit, but I\u2019m not your girl. May I respectfully suggest you call upon, say, Barbara Kingsolver?\u201d (The book also has her talking to self-doubt and to fear.)", "After", "Gilbert had a multitude of fans who wanted to befriend her or be her or follow her.", "Despite such whimsy, most of the advice is matter-of-fact. Creativity becomes both magical\u2014big magical\u2014and somewhat prosaic. It\u2019s better to just get things done than to try to make them perfect, Gilbert writes. Stop worrying so much about what other people think; they\u2019re all too busy thinking about themselves to think about you. Don\u2019t quit your day job. Don\u2019t complain. Sit back down and do the work. If you set aside her sweeping words of encouragement and her quasi-divine take on inspiration, and you are left with boot-strappy practicality.", "Part of what animated", "was Gilbert\u2019s frankly high-achieving approach to the project of pleasure\u2014the antsy ambition that prevented her from hanging out indefinitely on a beach in Bali. Because she\u2019s a writer, this energy takes the form of unflagging curiosity, extensive research, and the interpersonal maneuvering required to get people to talk to her and listen to her. But it\u2019s not hard to sense an echo here of the Yankee industriousness that", "describes her back-to-the-land farmer parents as possessing. Likewise Eustace Conway, the wilderness survivalist she depicted in", ", tanning his own buckskin clothes in Appalachia; or, for that matter, the heroine of her first novel,", "whose great triumph is starting a cooperative organization for Maine lobster fisherman. Gilbert\u2019s signature characters (\u201cElizabeth Gilbert\u201d included) are hard workers with the zeal and resourcefulness to build successful, unconventional lives. And creativity, as she portrays it, is basically the pursuit of happiness through work.", "Gilbert presents \u201ccreative living\u201d as a conduit for everyday art-making, but the phrase also suggests one\u2019s own life as a creation. The labor she assigns to the character Elizabeth Gilbert is writing, yes, but more importantly self-improvement\u2014whether that means making herself more open to pleasure, more loving and more loved, or more creative. The life she has created for herself is remarkable, as is the skill with which she presents it.", "is self-help that\u2019s less about solving any particular problem than about embracing the belief that something better is out there.", "opened with an epigraph from Frederick Jackson Turner. Describing the influence of the frontier on \u201cthe American Intellect,\u201d Turner wrote of \u201cthat practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to find expedients; that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends; that restless, nervous energy; that dominant individualism, working for good or for evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance which comes from freedom.\u201d", "This is not a bad description of Gilbert\u2019s own style. Perhaps the real lesson of", "is not that you don't have to be a bestselling author to be creative\u2014it's that you don't have conquer a frontier to embody American enterprise. And while no one heads west anymore to look for gold in the wilderness, the buried treasure of personal fulfillment still exerts a powerful pull.
