My mother was always in a mood, which is a prerequisite for artistic whimsy. I expect I would\u2019ve been the next Ted Hughes if my love for Pandora hadn\u2019t been requited. Poets and intellectuals can\u2019t possess their hearts\u2019 desire at fourteen; there\u2019s nowhere to go but downhill!", "Courtesy of Methuen.", "The birth of my exceptionalism was unquestionably aborted by Pandora\u2019s agreement to go out with me. This is where I might say \u201cjust my luck\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t trade a day with Pandora for the world, and that\u2019s how life ends up isn\u2019t it.

She knew that spots were awful and they weren\u2019t bloody character-building, and that love is something only someone with heart can do. Her words were fearless and kind, sensitive, and achingly funny, but most of all she was honest.
