The shot was of Costello\u2019s father, the well-known singer and bandleader Ross MacManus, who often adopted pseudonyms for his commercial knockoff singles. He chose \u201cCostello\u201d for the same reason Declan Patrick MacManus later would: It was Ross\u2019 granny\u2019s maiden name. On other occasions he was \u201cHal Prince\u201d or \u201cFrank Bacon and the Baconeers\u201d\u2014no wonder his son was unfazed when his own manager suggested an outlandish showbiz sobriquet.", "Yet the", "s fib pointed at a truth most Costello fans never fully assimilated. Watch this YouTube clip of the single in question, including the same photo (I assume). See the horn-rimmed glasses, the munificent Irish nose. Hear the vibrato on the sustained notes. It\u2019s the spitting image, albeit without his heir\u2019s spitting diction.", "The resemblance also ran deeper, in ways both lucky and nasty. If there is any center to the sprawling, 670-page", "which free-associates on themes from Costello\u2019s life without any obvious throughline, perhaps on the model of Bob Dylan\u2019s", "\u2014it is that inheritance. Ross MacManus died of Parkinson\u2019s and dementia four years ago, and the book seems driven by a desire both to honor him and to reckon with his legacy and in turn the one Costello, now 61, will leave to his own offspring.", "Growing up in the 1980s, I thought of the singer of \u201cOliver\u2019s Army\u201d and \u201cBeyond Belief\u201d as my Bob Dylan. He was nearly as acute in transmuting language into music and back again but more electrically skeptical and more socially and sexually insecure, as suited the times. Later, as his star dipped (or, in North America, never quite dawned), he extended into other vocabularies, from country to soul to baroque pop and string quartets, as if reaching for historical handholds against the growing will to cultural acceleration and amnesia. (Which much of punk, in retrospect, seems to endorse unwittingly.)", "Before long, Costello\u2019s catalogue had built into a pileup as unwieldy as one of his most notoriously crammed multisyllabic lines. The highlights became a matter of any listener\u2019s opinion. It became harder to follow his tangents, though the music often rewarded the attention, especially onstage, where he remains as compelling a performer as there is.", "I can\u2019t help seeing that transition as a bit of a mystery: Once, he had been the one who brought societal bulletins with a backbeat, less protest singer than human thermometer, lyrics loaded with flash points like a", ".

What becomes clear in", "is that Ross MacManus was in fact a complete pro, one of the main featured vocalists of one of England\u2019s most successful stage combos of the time, the Glenn Miller\u2013styled Joe Loss Orchestra. He met Costello\u2019s mother when she was working in a music shop, having heard that she was a jazz enthusiast too. (She even ran an illicit American bebop record smuggling ring.)", "Ross was on radio and TV regularly and played the same 1963 Royal Command Performance where John Lennon famously told the \u201ccheap seats\u201d to clap their hands and the aristocrats to rattle their jewelry: Ross sang his", "of Pete Seeger\u2019s \u201cIf I Had a Hammer,\u201d to the pleasure of the Queen Mother, \u201cwho was very fond of work songs,\u201d Costello writes, \u201cnever having had a job of her own.\u201d", "In writing redolent of the stale and still-smoldering air of postwar Britain, we witness Costello hanging around backstages and dance halls, seeing his Dad go off to work when other kids\u2019 fathers were coming home and hearing him practice all manner of songs to be able to keep up with demand for the latest from the hit parade. Ross learned his way around swing, bebop, folk, rock, pop, easy listening and even Pink Floyd\u2014anticipating his son\u2019s later eclecticism. Ross also provided the vocals (with his son singing backup) for one of the best-known British TV ads of the 1970s, in which a husband sneaks down to the fridge at night crooning about being \u201ca secret lemonade drinker,\u201d which itself sounds like an Elvis Costello line.", "In a way, the", "had gotten the story figuratively right: Costello had been performing since around 1970, first as a teenager in a close-harmony acoustic duo and then in what later got termed \u201cpub rock\u201d bands. He was born in 1954 and his experiences of Beatlemania and, later, of hitchhiking to outdoor festivals to see the Band; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; Joni Mitchell; and the Grateful Dead mark him as more of a classic boomer than his \u201cangry young man\u201d image gave away. He didn\u2019t subscribe to punk\u2019s no-history/no-future manifestos, and his stage name and glasses (providing a \u201c", "in reverse\u201d effect) were given to him by his manager; he went along cheerfully because that was showbiz.", "At the start he was more adult than his years, and his peers, working a straight suburban job (data entry at an Elizabeth Arden lipstick factory) to support a wife and infant son. It was only success that brought a regression, one that he\u2019d voiced premonitions about in", ": \u201cWhen they told me \u2019bout my side of the bargain, I knew that I would not refuse/ And I won\u2019t get any older, now the angels wanna wear my red shoes.\u201d He comments now: \u201cI had barely received a hint of encouragement from the world outside, but knew that there was a jealousy and malevolence to the pursuit of fame that would not allow you to get any older once the deal was struck.\u201d", "Likewise, when he wrote \u201c", ",\u201d he was sounding \u201cmy fear that I would not be faithful or that my disbelief in happy endings would lead me to kill the love I had longed for.\u201d (His first wife, Mary, was someone he\u2019d fallen for from afar back in high school.) That pessimism about family came from his father\u2019s own trespasses against Costello\u2019s mother, which seem to have been serial and flagrant. In this way, too, Costello would turn out to be a chip off the old block. Or maybe it was just an occupational hazard. Like his boy, Ross was himself the only son of an itinerant musician, an orphaned military and later ocean-liner bandsman. In the book he writes, \u201c[My] Dad and I had also the capacity for selfish cruelties that the solitary child can think routine and acceptable.\u201d", "Those cruelties were visited particularly on Mary, whom Costello cheated on promiscuously while he and the Attractions stormed Britain and America in a haze of booze and pills in his brief, early \u201cpop star\u201d years. The book circles again and again to his regrets about his actions, though discreetly and sometimes obliquely\u2014the way he handled such matters in many of his lyrics, in which he often transposed pronouns and mixed carnal and romantic imagery with politics and commerce, for the sake of art but also for a touch of obfuscation. As he writes, this was pop music, not the confessional.", "One of the book\u2019s most wrenching moments comes a quarter-century later, when Mary came to see Costello perform for the first time in decades. He was employing his colorful invention, the Spectacular Spinning Songbook, a wheel of fortune full of song titles that audience volunteers would spin to determine the setlist, a way of keeping the performances fresh. That evening, though, \u201cthe contraption delivered eight songs in a row that detailed how our life together fell apart\u2014the songs I wrote when I betrayed her, and really broke both of our hearts. It\u2019s hard to describe the mortification that I felt that night.\u201d", "Nevertheless, inevitably the most exciting sections of the book, though they\u2019re also the most-previously-rehearsed, are those chapters that chronicle the early Attractions years, with an intensity of both life and art such that every month was packed with incident. The momentum came to a crash, however, late one infamous night in March 1979, when Costello was drinking with members of the Stephen Stills band in Columbus, Ohio. He was winding them up by slandering American music, culminating by dismissing Ray Charles and James Brown in vile racist terms (including the N-word), which set off a fistfight. The next day his arm was in a sling and his still-obscure name all over the press. The tour meant to make his career in America sabotaged it instead.", "He deals head on with Columbus here, although he avoids repeating his statements (which, to be fair, he can\u2019t remember saying). He disavows having any hidden racist sentiments, and while no white person should deny that infection so stridently, the evidence of his life and art, before and after, mostly justifies him. Costello doesn\u2019t mention it, but his father wrote a letter to", "objecting to his son being characterized as a racist, saying that his own background as an Ulster Catholic led him to despise intolerance and his son was raised the same way.", "I think the explanation, beyond a blind-drunk relish for provocation at any cost, is more in the young Costello\u2019s insular Britishness. The American version of racial tension was abstract to him, so he did not grasp the depths of the obscenities he was uttering, however facetiously. (For a much deeper analysis of the incident and its reverberations, as well as Costello\u2019s music in general, read", "in the", ".)", "What surprises me here is not his self-defense\u2014which he is careful to balance by saying, \u201cThere are no excuses\u201d\u2014but that he still feels hounded and haunted by that night. Whenever he meets someone new, he writes, he wonders if they know and are thinking ill of him. Thirty-five years is a long time to carry even a self-inflicted wound.", "Yet he also says that night might have \u201csaved my sorry life.\u201d There\u2019s no telling where his excesses were leading, especially if amplified by further fame and fortune. He\u2019s grateful for the \u201cmore interesting\u201d life that resulted from \u201cthis failure to get into some undeserved and potentially fatal orbit.\u201d Costello didn\u2019t actually stop drinking for another couple of decades, but he does not discuss that here, so thankfully it does not turn into a rehab-and-redemption memoir. The book\u2019s asynchronous structure permits him to omit what he pleases, without the gaps becoming obvious. If he avoids much mention of his 16-year second marriage, to Cait O\u2019Riordan of the Pogues, whether from enmity or respect, that\u2019s fine with me. But the way he handles one other controversy bears scrutiny.", "In Chapter 13, the one actually titled \u201cUnfaithful Music,\u201d he says that of everything people have said about his music, the most \u201cbewildering\u201d charge to him is misogyny. He points out, I think rightly, that many of the songs marshaled in those accusations, such as \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model\u201d and \u201cParty Girl,\u201d are depictions and critiques of misogyny instead. He claims people are projecting \u00a0or \u201cjust weren\u2019t listening very hard.\u201d", "He partly blames an early quote from an interview in which he hyperbolically (and drunkenly) said that all his songs were motivated by \u201crevenge and guilt,\u201d which the press never let go. And he even says that because of the gap between his front teeth, everything he sang tended to come out with an unintentional hiss. \u201cIf everything you say sounds like the beginning of an argument, it is easy for someone to miss the joke and look for the smart remark, where only the heartfelt word is written.\u201d", "While it\u2019s true the \u201cangry\u201d Costello was a caricature, it was one in which he was complicit. (Showbiz, again.) More so, many of his songs", "argumentative, which is one of their virtues\u2014unlike a lot of more impressionistic musicians, he has a restless and tenacious mind that likes to pull subjects apart and reassemble them askew. (Contra David Lee Roth, critics don\u2019t love Elvis Costello so much because he", "but because he thinks like them.)", "And his subjects, especially on his early albums, often involved gender roles and sexual tension\u2014the way that both sides of an amorous exchange objectify, exploit, and commodify each other and weaponize sex for status. He often views sociopolitical problems through a sexual lens as well and always from the masculine side. It all certainly enhanced his art. He shouldn\u2019t be called out more than other male musicians because he confronted these dynamics rather than being oblivious to them. But neither should he expect total absolution.", "If I seem to be dwelling on select aspects of the book here, making it seem less lighthearted than it really is, it\u2019s because most reviews and interviews about", "have bypassed the charge of its title and dwelt on the easier bits: his explanations of certain songs, his evocations of family and showbiz history, and all the musicians he\u2019s admired and/or worked with. The last third of the book is heavy on that last element, so maybe it looms largest in reviewers\u2019 impressions afterwards.", "Costello is indeed a great raconteur, and the book is a cornucopia of witty anecdotes and musical insights. I particularly relished learning that one of my favorite \u201cminor\u201d songs of his, the 1980 bonus track \u201c", "\u201d", "dated from years earlier and was actually a turning point in his writing: He borrowed from", "the notion of simply toasting a mundane spot, an art-deco vacuum factory he saw each day on his way to work in data entry, but then added his own rejoinder, \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of life or death \u2026 Who cares? Who cares?\u201d\u2014the first time a shrug, the second time a real question. He says the song took him \u201cthrough the door to a different, less ingratiating way of speaking.\u201d", "As a huge fan of his two-season in-depth musical talk show,", ", I also relished those scenes from backstage. But in more than 600 pages, charming stories, celebrity cameos, and creative exegesis become exhausting without some unifying themes, and Costello is chary about them. I located mine in the mystery of the early Costello versus the late, and the clues are most present in how he deals with the causes, memories, and aftermath of\u2014as he put it in a 2002 album title\u2014", ".", "It was after Columbus, his first divorce, and a few wilderness years that he shifted back nearer to his father\u2019s public shape, within his own variation on the entertainment world that whelped him. Perhaps it was in gradual realization of and penance for what his more lone-wolf,", "instincts had wrought. Artistically it was both an expansion and a loss. But it may have been necessary to the peace he seems to find toward the end of the book, in his new family in Vancouver, Canada, with jazz singer Diana Krall and their twin boys.
