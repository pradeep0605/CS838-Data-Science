{"Body": ["Illustration by Matt Kindt.", "Imagine the following scenario. You\u2014and in this scenario \u201cyou\u201d are a celebrated young writer who just so happens to be a woman\u2014have written your latest novel off-recipe. You never bothered with the conventions of plot, climax, d\u00e9nouement. In fact, you attack the idea of fiction\u00a0itself, by incorporating the personal histories, quirks, and even actual names of some of your friends, into what you still call \u201ca novel.\u201d You take years to write it. And then, when you present the novel to the editor of your last book, a man who will soon be put in charge of", ", he not only says that he himself will not publish it but tells you that, word to the wise,", ".", "You find another editor, a woman.

Perhaps because it is listening for that call, no less than", "decides to review it. (They ignored your last book.) And not just any review: They assign it to one of the last rock-star literary critics left, a man so acclaimed he can plausibly write a book about how \u201cfiction\u201d\u2014", "\u2014works. He concludes that your book does not, in fact, work. And though", "very similar to yours (that one was", ", but one of the same age and same meandering disposition, one who also mixed fiction and fact), the critic\u2019s lukewarm review is written with the air of one holding the offending item out at arm\u2019s length, sniffing warily.", "Sheila Heti may recognize this story I have been telling, because it is taken from her life, just like her new novel,", "The book is an attempt to answer that titular question\u2014and as something of a philosophical investigation, it is bound not to be everyone\u2019s travel mug of fair-trade Darjeeling. The intrigue, here, is that it has prompted these influential, \u201cserious\u201d men to plant themselves so firmly in its way. This looks all the more strange when you consider that one of the novel\u2019s refrains, one I already find myself repeating at cocktail parties, over dinner, to myself as I write this review, is this: \u201cHe\u2019s just another man who wants to teach me something.\u201d", "The first character to utter those words is Margaux Williamson (a character based on", "). Her friendship with Sheila (the character, not the author\u2014not exactly, anyway) is the closest thing the story has to a driving narrative force. This is a story of girl meets girl, girl talks to girl, girl talks to girl again, girl buys same dress as girl, girl makes up with girl, and so forth. There are other friends in the constellation Heti presents, but they are dwarves to Margaux\u2019s supergiant, at least in Sheila\u2019s ordering of the universe. And it\u2019s in her relationship with Margaux, a painter, that Sheila investigates, and reinvestigates, and reinvestigates, the question that obsesses her. This is not the kind of book you can really spoil, but I will say, right off the bat, that the process of asking turns out to be just as important as the answer.", "You could call this navel-gazing\u2014or, if you are James Wood, you can", "into question. An author invites that critique by keeping the world of her book very small. But a critic needs to pause, at least, before simply dismissing a writer\u2019s unapologetic focus on the intellectual effects of female friendships. It is no accident that Sheila\u2019s sexual affair with a lout named Israel is not of interest to Margaux, who is \u201cmade impatient by conversations about relationships or men.\u201d That echo you hear is of the \u201c", ",\u201d which applied to movies asks whether the film contains a conversation between two women about something other than a man. The world of books, lacking the bombast imparted by the Hollywood machine, has largely been excused from such rigid measures. But the truth is that literature has its own line to tow here. In \u201cserious\u201d fiction of the sort reviewed by \u201cserious\u201d people, the subjects discussed by women tend not to be so wide and abstract as the nature of \u201c", "\u201d (to steal a man\u2019s phrase, because there are few others available). Pointing to anything made primarily by women\u2014", ",", ",", "\u2014and declaring it a triumph for all women everywhere is an increasingly popular pastime. But I\u2019m not willing to plant a victory flag until the kinds of conversations Sheila has with Margaux feel much less rare\u2014or, at least, provoke a reaction in male critics other than the dubious rubbernecking they currently inspire.", "But wasn\u2019t", "", ", you might ask? Comparisons", "are inevitable, but not terribly apt\u2014if only because Dunham\u2019s interests are so much narrower than Heti\u2019s. Dunham\u2019s Hannah Horvath is not the type to ask many questions about the nature of art: She is a solipsist uninterested in real questions about solipsism. Her creator is too preoccupied with getting to the next sight gag\u2014or, put differently, the next way to mediate her (admittedly original) voice into something more palatable. Sure, certain gatekeeper critics loved", "\u2014Hilton Als was particularly unable to contain himself,", "\u2014but it didn\u2019t challenge them in the way that Heti\u2019s book does.", "Heti\u2019s closer analogue might be Fiona Apple, who wrote", "with a long title that she fought for because it was what suited her. And now every piece about Apple", "begin with a thicket of speculation, ventured under the cover of artistic respect, that she is crazy. Even Apple\u2019s noticed it. \u201c", "\u201d she asked Jon Pareles of the", ". Even when someone admits that what Apple has to say is worth hearing, they can\u2019t resist the armchair psychologizing. Push the envelope too far as a female artist, and you may only earn an ocean of ink expressing concern for your delicate constitution, amounting to a caution against playing on traditionally male wavelengths.", "Photo by Sylvia Plachy Color.", "Like Apple, Heti knows what she\u2019s doing\u2014much of the pleasure of", "comes from watching her control the norms she\u2019s subverting. Take what even Heti\u2019s most fervent acolyte must admit is the loose, sometimes bland quality of the conversations in this book. To simply call them banal and stop there ignores (or misunderstands) the strange way this book works. When you turn those conversations over (and over) in your mind, you\u2019ll find something else going on. Sheila herself tapes her conversations with Margaux, transcribing them into a sort of scripture. This is a novel that wonders if the ugly can be beautiful, if there is clarity to be found in the drifting. The occasional banality of the conversations is a deliberate challenge, not least to the notion of banality itself.", "So sure,", "may not be an ideal beach read, but why does that matter on the level of serious art? In one of the novel\u2019s intermittent moments of sparkling lucidity, Sheila observes that, \u201cHad anyone suggested at the time that it would not be the Egypt of the pharaohs that would survive and change the moral landscape of the world, but instead a group of Hebrew slaves, it would have seemed the ultimate absurdity.\u201d She and her friends, the slaves of the metaphor, must struggle with the fact that, for the moment, their language is that of the underdogs, and is ugly to the common reader. But Heti has reason to hope that some readers will take the seriousness and precision of her book on faith, because it is, frankly, what artists upending orthodoxies have always expected.", "Zadie Smith, in an essay about David Foster Wallace\u2014both of them writers whose work has not always met with James Wood\u2019s approval\u2014argued that Wallace, for all of his difficulty, was simply looking for another level of understanding, a higher awareness than the preoccupations of the modern world demand. \u201cStrange to say it,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut Wallace wanted", "readers.\u201d Perhaps the best thing to say about Heti\u2019s book is that it demands the same.

It \u201cseems like the big distinction between good art and so-so art lies somewhere in the art\u2019s heart\u2019s purpose,\u201d he said, \u201cthe agenda of the consciousness behind the text.\u201d On every page of", "that agenda\u2014to make you ask questions, to keep your mind whirring on this whole question of being\u2014is palpable.
