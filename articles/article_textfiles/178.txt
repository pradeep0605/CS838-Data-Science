{"Body": ["Illustration by Jen Wang", "Many New Yorkers suffer from a suspicion that they arrived here too late. Once, not so long ago, artists clustered in the Village, living in tiny, cheap apartments that squeezed them out onto the pavement, into theaters and music clubs. There was a fluidity between making work and hanging out; the art of New York painters and poets and novelists\u2014the conversational wit, the spontaneity, the melding of high and low, pristine and dirty, from the \u201950s up until the early \u201980s, reflects this flow. Though you might yearn to, you can never hang out in that ragged, glittery New York\u2014but you can hang out in Eileen Myles\u2019s funny, wild, open-hearted version of it, in her second novel,", ". It will teach you that yearning has always been the primary emotion of New York\u2019s artists.", "\u2014the second of the five books we judges are naming to", "\u2014is about a young woman, Eileen Myles, who is newly arrived in New York. She\u2019s plunged into the downtown scene of the \u201970s, ferociously determined to write, desiring other women, stomping around town. The book feels like it was put down in gusts of inspiration, between drinking and sex and poetry readings. It can be read that way, too: between meals, on the toilet, or standing under an awning waiting for a break in the rain. Or you can sit with it for a while, in the wintry light of an apartment cased in steam heat, looking out the back window. But the streets are its true territory; its weather is the storm of language.", "Terrible sex and invigorating sex: Both kinds fill Eileen with power.", "For Eileen, as for many young artists, becoming a poet means accumulating experience, almost any experience available. It doesn\u2019t matter how revolting\u2014sitting in basements with crazy people declaiming bad verse, or agreeing to be a whore for a night. Her fl\u00e2neur\u2019s search for the tawdry, the strange, people and things perfumed by garbage, is a poet\u2019s clich\u00e9. But her language is not: Reading the book you think how there are as many ways to write novels as there are brains, processing memories, images, and sensations through their own weird labyrinths. Her vantage point is also fresh. I\u2019ve read plenty of", "about brave and suffering young men; I hadn\u2019t, until now, read one by a lesbian poet from a working-class family in Boston, with a thrashing, generous intelligence. She explicitly models her book on Dante\u2019s (it\u2019s broken into three, with its own hell, purgatory, and heaven, aligning roughly with different phases in Myles\u2019s sexual and poetic career). In doing so Myles asserts her ambition to imprint her particular set of experiences on the canon.", "Or, as she puts it:", "The book is made of anecdotes, strung together like bright amber beads. Some of my favorites are about sex\u2014terrible sex and invigorating sex. Both kinds fill Eileen with power. A story about selling herself to an Italian businessman one night in her early 20s avoids the usual categories of violation vs. consent, volition vs. submission. She is much more interested in trying to get at a lyrical description of how it felt and looked. What she ends up with is a sensitive, sharp-edged piece of\u00a0writing about indifferent sex with an older stranger in a gray midtown hotel room, a description that soars above the experience, rendering it both comical and sublime:", "Look what language can do! Look how it covers over the past, like soft snow. In the end, there\u2019s no real question of having been used, because she uses the experience: It has given her exactly what she\u2019d hoped for, a new set of sensations to be transformed into poetry.", "Photo by Alice O'Malley", "There are longueurs in the book, repetitions (", "poetry reading in St. Mark\u2019s Church?), but the language gathers energy, and then there is a sentence, or a paragraph, that is a bolt of originality:", "On Hart Crane: \u201cHart produced in a flicker the veins he spied in a lover\u2019s breast. His twists of attention made your breath go still.\u201d", "On performance of poems: \u201cI mean I would definitely say poetry is a very roundabout way to unite both work and time. A poet is a person with a very short attention span who actually decides to study it. To look. To draw that short thing out. It\u2019s an old, feudal idea. Finally what you see is the thing you have in common with everyone else.\u201d", "On sex: \u201cSex was a disordered prayer.\u201d", "Her language is both precise and messy, staggering toward meaning. There\u2019s a sense of cheerful disorder, like a pile of papers being gleefully tossed around a bare room. Maybe the room is a loft, with creaky old floors and whitewashed walls. On the papers are clever aphorisms (\u201cA lot of romance is just the swapping of alibis\u201d), graceful line drawings, bits of ancient poetry, peculiar verbal expressions humorously shouted from a high window onto the street. Through this hectic burst of language, sped up because the observing consciousness is so alert, the reader senses a lucidity, an eye trained to see both farther and deeper than we can.", "One more, her description of a Raymond Pettibone drawing of a girl:", "is the scream of that hungry girl, purified by the disciplined work of a mature poet\u2019s mind.", "\u2014", "by Eileen Myles.
