(It\u2019s unfortunate that Pilkey\u2019s approach, and appeal, is so rigidly boy-focused. Girls have no place in the Captain\u2019s world.) These readers are embodied by George and Harold, Pilkey\u2019s heroes, who make mischief while dodging the sadistic teachers of Jerome Horwitz Elementary. Their greatest adversary is Principal Krupp, whose \"very soul danced at the thought of crushing a child's spirit and dashing his or her hopes and dreams against the jagged rocks of never-ending despair.\" After the punishment for a particularly excellent pep-rally prank proves too much for the boys to endure, they hypnotize Principal Krupp into assuming the identity of one Captain Underpants, who \"fights for Truth, Justice, and all that is Pre-Shrunk and Cottony!\u201d Over the course of nine books, the boys and the Captain have battled talking toilets, aliens disguised as nasty lunch-ladies, supersonic wedgies, evil robots, Professor Tinkletrousers, and the daily threat of lifelong detention.", "The children's literature world is brimming with poignant, metaphor-heavy, gracefully rendered portraits of childhood that English teachers just", ".", "is not one of them.

They are Roald Dahl's evil adults, but even more broadly-drawn; like Dahl, Pilkey does not sugarcoat the unfairness of childhood or the petty tyrannies of adults on power trips. At Jerome Horwitz Elementary, drawn from Pilkey's own childhood experience, teachers punish creativity and praise blind obedience. They force the students to obey soul-crushing rules, oppose independent thought, and feed them poisonous cafeteria food and aggressively mind-numbing lessons.", "This gross caricature of the villainous teacher may not be appreciated by the underpaid, overworked educators who toil thanklessly to educate the nation's children\u2013I don't know any teachers who actually relish the pain of children the way Pilkey's do (except the gym teachers of my youth). But with all due respect to the dedicated teachers (and none to the gym teacher), so what? Any teacher/student power dynamic is tipped in the adult's favor, and children need to feel like someone understands the fundamental unfairness of their world. Pilkey may be overly hard on teachers, but there can sometimes be nothing harder than a terrible teacher for a struggling kid.", "And anyway, Pilkey, like Dahl, does not demand that his youthful protagonists be better than the adults who torment them. The boys sabotage the work of their fellow students (\u201cnerds\u201d come in for an unsettling amount of scorn from the usually underdog-rooting Pilkey) and often cross the line from pranksters to genuine terrors.

The novel flashes back to kindergarten, where George and Harold, both lonely and bright misfits, find each other while taking down the school bully, who happens to be Mr. Krupp's nephew. \"There is not a whole lot you can do when you are a little kid who encounters injustice,\u201d Pilkey writes, offering the kind of wisdom that every parent and teacher ought to recognize the value of. \u201cThe sad truth is, big people usually have all of the power. You can't force anyone to be kind or fair or honorable, especially if you're only forty-three inches tall and weigh only fifty pounds.
