This guy\u2014this whole other Geoff Dyer\u2014was apparently a former Beijing bureau chief with the", "I became briefly preoccupied with him, or with the idea of him; I imagined what a curse it must be to share a name, and therefore be forced to compete in Amazon searches, with a writer so much more widely known and celebrated than oneself, not to mention one who wrote in so many different genres and on so many topics that a casual book-browser would have no good reason not to assume that he had written a book that was in fact by you. I wondered whether this other Geoff Dyer had considered changing his name, or even just tweaking it\u2014to Geoffrey Dyer, say, or Geoff Q. Dyer\u2014and whether his decision not to might have been based on the famous gift-horse/mouth principle, because sales had actually started to pick up on account of these same confused book-browsers.

I imagine Dyer himself has had versions of this exchange on quite a few occasions.)", "Dyer\u2019s first two novels,", "and", "have now been published for the first time in the U.S., on the same day as his latest nonfiction excursion,", ".

And", "is an account of Dyer\u2019s 2011 experience as a writer in residence onboard the", "aircraft carrier, off the coast of Bahrain. The only thing these books really have in common is the fact that nothing much happens in any of them. Which is to say that what happens in these books is, primarily, Geoff Dyer\u2019s writing. One of his more impressive gifts is the ability to create a sense of momentum within essentially static narratives; the way in which nothing happens, in his work, can often have the aura of spectacle. And this has everything to do with the charisma of his voice, with the leisurely sharpness of his prose. Whatever it is he happens to be writing about, and whatever genre he happens to be avoiding doing it in, Dyer has become one of the most reliably entertaining of contemporary writers. His own hypersusceptibility to being bored has turned out to be an effective inoculation against being boring himself.", "From the very start of his career, Dyer has been getting away with having nothing happen in his books. (One measure of talent would be the extent of what you can get away with.)", ", first published in 1989, is, in ways, very obviously a first novel, in that it draws heavily on the experiences of its author\u2019s early adulthood, and is more or less openly indebted to some prominent predecessors. There\u2019s a lot of Fitzgerald, for one thing, and a fair amount of Waugh, in its elegiac evocations of a doomed leisure class. The youthful wasters at the center of this novel are not wealthy layabouts, though, but the post-collegiate electively unemployed who were once broadly accommodated by Britain\u2019s social welfare system. (In one of the earlier of the novel\u2019s numerous party scenes, one of the characters holds forth on the literary romance of the so-called lost generation: \u201cIt\u2019s meaningless,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery generation wants to think it\u2019s lost. Take us. Who could have been more lost than us? We\u2019re so lost we\u2019re virtually extinct.\u201d)", "As a thin substitute for anything remotely resembling a plot, Dyer numbers his short chapters in descending order, counting down from 060 toward 000. This is meant to evoke a steady diminution of time; not a countdown to any conclusive event, but rather the passing of youth itself, which is the ongoing event at the center of the novel. There are whole chapters that are entirely composed of descriptions of scene, pure narrative still life. As the novel progresses, the consciousness of passing time is increasingly countered by a preservational instinct:", "This works as a sort of casual", "as", "an internal figuring of the novel\u2019s own methods and motivations, its artful eulogizing of a life of nothing much\u2014of hanging out in flats and on rooftops and at agreeably boring parties, drinking and getting stoned and fancying your best mate\u2019s girlfriend.", "The most striking thing about", ", first published in 1993, is how it both does and doesn\u2019t default on this loiterly ethos. The machinery of plot is vanishingly minimal here (private detective/good-looking dame/missing husband), but it\u2019s sufficient to drive the narrative, such as it is. Dyer\u2019s protagonist, the functionally named Walker, tracks Malory (missing husband) through a lengthy succession of imaginary and increasingly strange locations. Malory is a classic MacGuffin; in fact, the entire narrative is a MacGuffin, a pretext for describing a Calvinoesque series of strange imaginary locations.", "There\u2019s a town that\u2019s all one gigantic building, where the streets are corridors and the houses are rooms. There\u2019s a town where everyone is frozen in midgesture, like a vast three-dimensional photograph. Particularly rich is the stultifying American nowheresville of Despond, in which Walker finds himself sinking into a general lethargy of spirit, leaving him profoundly disinclined to continue his pursuit of Malory.", "Although my interest in", "was beginning to dwindle well before the end of its 159 pages, the novel\u2019s heavily MacGuffinized setup made me consider the extent to which the MacGuffin is a central presence in Dyer\u2019s career as a whole. Because the thing about Geoff Dyer is that the subjects of his books are never really the point anyway. The subject of a Geoff Dyer book is only ever the pretext, the flimsiest excuse, for a book by Geoff Dyer. In books like", "and", ", for instance, the topic itself\u2014D.H. Lawrence, Tarkovsky\u2019s film", "\u2014is always essentially in service of the writing, which is exactly the opposite of how nonfiction is set up to operate.

For one thing, the book is as concentratedly funny as anything he\u2019s written. The situation provides plenty of occasion to exercise the comic persona he\u2019s been consolidating for most of his career. There\u2019s a wonderful diversion in the opening pages, where Dyer point-blank refuses to accept the suboptimal sleeping arrangements on this supercarrier with a crew of well over 5,000. Not getting his own room is entirely out of the question, as far as he\u2019s concerned: \u201cBut we writers need a room of one\u2019s own, I claimed, trusting that any grammatical damage would be more than offset\u2014in the eyes of the Navy\u2014by the Virginia Woolf allusion.\u201d This tenacity pays off, and he gets his room of one\u2019s own. \u201cI had taken on the might of the US Navy and won,\u201d he gloats. The room itself is, as he puts it, \u201cpractically the honeymoon suite, a place where a man could devote himself single-handed to the maritime art of masturbation.\u201d", "Dyer is nothing like a proper journalist. He keeps forgetting and mixing up people\u2019s names, for example.", "Thankfully, Dyer doesn\u2019t go down this route, possibly because he\u2019s saving that subject for a whole other project\u2014perhaps a sequel to his", ". Instead, he spends the majority of the book being escorted around the vast carrier, talking to people about their various roles and their lives at sea. This might make it sound like a conventional work of journalism or reportage, but Dyer frequently makes it obvious that he\u2019s nothing like a proper journalist. He keeps forgetting and mixing up people\u2019s names, for example, and is not immune to getting bored with what they\u2019re telling him and losing the thread of interviews. It isn\u2019t these lapses per se that separate him from your typical journalist, so much as his willingness to admit to them, to make of them his own peculiar literary virtue. Dyer has always been doggedly committed to making a virtue of his own weaknesses. As he put it in a short piece in the", "last year, \u201cA writer\u2019s only possible relation to his or her failings has to be one of gratitude. First because there are hundreds of other writers out there whose strengths lie precisely in these areas of weakness. Second because these weaknesses oblige us to concentrate on the one or two little areas that are uniquely\u2014and, as far as every other writer is concerned, undesirably\u2014our own.\u201d", "Photo by Jason Oddy", "Many of the book\u2019s best moments\u2014and it is full of great moments\u2014are generated not by Dyer\u2019s attempts to honor his basic journalistic obligations, but by his hanging back and noticing the things that a typical reporter would likely deem irrelevant. He\u2019s at his most interesting here, as he always is, when he\u2019s insisting on the importance of trivialities. Here he is, for instance, watching members of the ground crew hanging about on deck during a quiet moment between launches: \u201cJohn Updike asks, in one of his books about art, if there is such a thing as an American face. I don\u2019t know, but looking at the guys on the flight deck, unfaced by cranials and vizors, persuaded me that there is such a thing as an American walk. Even overweight cops have it: an ease and grace, a subdued swagger. It used to be identified mainly with race\u2014a black thing\u2014but now it seems a cultural and national quality.\u201d A good writer, like a good standup comic, makes a point of mentioning things you yourself are likely to have noticed, but which you, unlike that writer or comic, are unlikely to have noticed yourself noticing. And like a good standup comic, Dyer is consistently alert to the comic potency of rhythmical accumulation. He is irrefutably one of contemporary literature\u2019s finest purveyors of face-melting riffs. Here, for instance, he takes his cue from a phrase used by the sailor from Florida who gives him a tour around one of the ship\u2019s many stores of explosives:", "Dyer\u2019s method of writing around rather than about his subject is typically one of his great strengths, but there are moments in", "when you wonder whether he should be doing more than nodding in the direction of the vast looming context of his immediate situation. About a third of the way through the book, I began to feel uneasy about his refusal to engage the military power of which this gigantic ship is both symbol and vessel\u2014his apparent lack of interest in the question of what this aircraft carrier is doing off the coast of Bahrain in the first place, what this booming industry of launching and landing is ultimately in service of. As brilliantly as he writes about the things he is interested in, and as worthy of consideration as he proves them to be, the largely unacknowledged presence of that context exerts a cumulative pressure on the book. In that short, jocular chapter in which Dyer browses the ship\u2019s explosives and lays down that rubber/road riff, I kept pausing between chuckles to wonder when the actual", "of this \u201cIKEA of munitions\u201d \u00a0was going to be addressed.
