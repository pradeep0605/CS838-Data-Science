{"Body": ["Illustration by Ken Niimura", "Some people are doomed to live as Internet footnotes. They\u2019re reduced to Google trails of ferocious commentary and invective that age poorly but never disappear. Here all fame is infamy, but if it can\u2019t be escaped, maybe it can be monetized\u2014cheaply, fleetingly. For them, it will be a defining life moment, the period of their public shaming, which often coincides with them being held up as the symbol of some malady of the age. But for the rest of us, they will probably be remembered, if at all, as a blog item we shared on Facebook or a name argued over at a happy hour because everyone needs easy small talk.", "Jon Ronson\u2019s", "is a tour through this world of the briefly controversial. Prepare for appearances from Justine Sacco (the \u201chope I don\u2019t get AIDS\u201d tweet heard \u2019round the universe); Adria Richards and \u201cHank\u201d of Donglegate; pop-science writer\u2013turned-plagiarist Jonah Lehrer; and Max Mosley, the eccentric British Formula One boss who was accused in a splashy tabloid story of participating in a Nazi-themed orgy. (Mosley\u2019s needle-threading explanation\u2014that it was a German military-themed orgy with no identifiable Nazi symbols\u2014earned him a win in England\u2019s plaintiff-friendly libel court. He\u2019s since become an unlikely leader in support of the right to be forgotten.) Ronson says this is a personal undertaking: He\u2019s participated in some public shamings, allowing himself to feel the righteous fury of the Twitter mob. Why? That\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to find out, along with the answer to another question that inevitably pops up: How are these people doing now?", "For many people,", ", but Ronson does an able job of advancing the story. He finds Lehrer pitiable and mostly sympathetic. He was \u201ctotally destroyed,\u201d Ronson explains. \u201cHe sounded exhausted, like he\u2019d been inside some spinning machine designed by aliens to test the effects of stress on humans.\u201d Ronson offers some fresh reporting from Lehrer\u2019s much-mocked appearance at a Knight Foundation event, for which Lehrer received $20,000 to speak about his downfall. Lehrer eventually cops to Ronson that he didn\u2019t want to do it, but he needed the money. And it\u2019s news to me, at least, that while speaking, Lehrer was able to see a screen on which appeared tweets from people watching the event\u2019s live stream. In a kind of vertiginous reactivation of the shame cycle, Lehrer was able to read comments blasting him for his apology speech while he was still delivering it.", "Ronson frequently refers to the people doing the public shaming as \u201cwe,\u201d some disembodied public that apparently acts out of shared consensus. Ronson\u2019s part of this we, but he declines to quote himself or to examine the kinds of people he might have targeted. While he looks at historical roots of the practice, he also doesn\u2019t consider the important role that the media, especially viral media, play in public shaming. Tabloids, cable news, and reality TV have long specialized in helping to make ordinary people objects of brief, coruscating interest. Usually this involves humiliating them in one way or another\u2014sometimes, as is the case with reality shows, with the consent of the subject. Now the role is often played by big news sites and content producers who know that they can play on audience outrage or the desire for a fool-of-the-day in order to boost traffic. A more thorough investigation of public shaming would examine how the media is complicit in this process of raising people up for ridicule.", "It might also look at issues of class, particularly at how many of the people shamed\u2014though not those in this book\u2014are often guilty of nothing less than being dumb or low class. (Think of the", ".) Ronson considers the 2011 London riots as an example of possible social contagion, a violent form of groupthink spreading among a crowd, but he doesn\u2019t ponder the much more germane issues of wealth inequality and police violence that helped start the protests. Instead, he\u2019s relieved that the riots stopped at the bottom of the hill he and his wife live on\u2014the tallest hill in London, he tells us, straining the metaphor.", "Ronson indulges in a roving sentimentality that produces some false conclusions.", "It\u2019s not that Ronson isn\u2019t aware of issues of class or gender or politics; it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t consider them deeply enough. (It\u2019s clear, for instance, that Mosley\u2019s riches insulated him from real harm, but this goes unmentioned.) When he speaks to Adria Richards, who used Twitter to report some men at a tech conference for jokes she considered sexually inappropriate, he\u2019s surprised when she quotes Margaret Atwood\u2019s famous line: \u201cMen are afraid that women will laugh at them and women are afraid that men will kill them.\u201d Thinking that she had nothing to fear at a large tech conference, Ronson offers a reply that feels dismissive: \u201cPeople might consider that an overblown thing to say,\u201d he tells her.", "Another useful insight comes from a woman named Mercedes, who identifies as an active user of the chaotic message board 4chan. Mercedes tells Ronson that 4chan\u2019s goal in shaming is \u201cto degrade the target.\u201d For men, that amounts to trying to get them fired; for women, it means rape threats. Both are based on cultural stereotypes about gender roles: that an unemployed man feels emasculated and that rape is one of the \u201chighest degradations\u201d a woman could suffer.", "This is the moment when a more politically attuned writer would dilate on the issue and further explore\u00a0the connection with the Adria Richards case. Wasn\u2019t Richards talking about some version of this\u2014that men fear embarrassment and that women fear violence? What might it mean then that public shamers often threaten to commit these very offenses?", "Ronson is a good interviewer, often eliciting astute comments from his subjects, but it seems he doesn\u2019t quite know what to make of them. I attribute this partly to the nature of the project: Ronson is seeking to get out of the public shaming mindset, to be empathic and nonjudgmental. But that leads him to indulge in a roving sentimentality that produces some false conclusions.", "Was Jonah Lehrer\u2019s life \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d? As Ronson discusses, Lehrer was still able to get a deal for a new book\u2014hardly the mark of someone without a professional future. Was Justine Sacco\u2019s life \u201cruined\u201d? Perhaps for a time it seemed so. But as shown by", ", the Gawker writer who played a role in making Sacco\u2019s fateful tweet go viral, Sacco recovered from her hardships and has a new, fulfilling job. Both would probably prefer to go back in time, but, well, some people are able to move on.", "Not everyone can. Adria Richards\u2014a black, Jewish woman who had a very harsh upbringing\u2014still can\u2019t get a job. (Recently she\u2019s", "how she thinks Ronson misrepresented her story.) She had to move out of her house and", "she spent most of 2013 staying with friends and flinching any time she heard her name in public. The man on the other side of her conflict quickly got a new job and has managed to keep his name a secret. That he\u2019s a white male in a tech industry that largely looks like him may be a coincidence, or it may be a useful data point in explaining his recovery.", "We don\u2019t need to choose sides here\u2014one of the most frustrating aspects of public shaming is the demand that we all declare allegiances in situations we know little about. But we should understand that complicated (and often, political) issues are at work. Ronson may very well think that Richards\u2019 quoting of the Atwood line is extreme, but he doesn\u2019t give much thought as to why she would invoke it. What does it mean if men really do fear being fired to the same degree that women fear being raped?", "This gender gap is key to understanding public shaming. At one point in the book, Ronson signs up to do a story where he dresses as a woman and goes out into the world to see how women are treated. But it shouldn\u2019t take such a stunt to empathize with another person\u2019s point of view. One way of finding out what it\u2019s like to be a woman walking down the street is to talk to actual women.", "Photo by Emli Bendixen", "The conceptual mistake that Ronson makes here is one that dogs the book: He foregrounds his own epiphanic understanding over the pain of his subjects and the issues they stir up. It causes him to seem rather guileless. The point of the kind of identity politics that Adria Richards gestures at is not to be ad hominem, as Ronson accuses her of being, but to recognize that different identities produce vastly different experiences and ways of being treated by others. And we come to understand these different experiences and their unique hardships not by simulating them, minstrellike, but by honestly reckoning with the testimony of others.", "I wish that Ronson had also considered why demanding that someone is fired from his or her job has become so central to the public shaming ritual. This demand, I think, reveals several things. First, it reflects how we are all public figures now and all have brands or reputations to protect, and so do our erstwhile employers. We have ported the logic of the celebrity shame cycle\u2014in which corporate sponsors are expected to drop the offender posthaste\u2014to the workaday world. It\u2019s a strange conflation of the public and private, of believing that individuals are always-on representatives of their employers and that an incensed public is in a position to decide when this association should end.", "The second thing that these calls for firing reveal is how precious a job has become and how truly punitive public shaming can be. We know that it\u2019s increasingly difficult to get a full-time job and losing one means having to fall back on a threadbare social safety net. Add to that the threat of a permanent Google trail (a feature that Ronson does a good job exploring), and being fired as a result of bringing disrepute on yourself or your employer can be a quick trip to precarity. Do shamers realize the jobless purgatory they might send their targets to? Has that become the singular marker of a \u201csuccessful\u201d shaming campaign?", "About right. I don't think people who enjoy the idea of getting strangers fired over tweets really understand the dystopia they're creating for themselves.", "", "-testostyrannical", "", "", "", "Finally, the effort to get people fired reveals one important driver of public shaming\u2014namely, a declining faith in the efficacy of American institutions. The public\u2019s mindset seems to be: No one will punish these people, so we have to do it ourselves. The parallels with the justice system and traditional notions of mob justice are obvious, and it\u2019s one of Ronson\u2019s smarter moves to visit a prison psychiatrist and a former judge who specialized in handing down embarrassing punishments. Yet when he tells the judge, Ted Poe, who\u2019s now a", "of the House of Representatives, that \u201cwe [public shamers] are", "\u201d (emphasis in original), Ronson suffers from the public shamer\u2019s lack of proportion. Shaming can be novel, scary, and pernicious, but America\u2019s overflowing prisons are distinct in their cruelty.", "Ronson leaves the interview horrified at the power he once indulged in: \u201cWe were soldiers making war on other people\u2019s flaws.\u201d The martial language is a bit much. It might be more accurate to say that, like so many participants in mob justice before him, Ronson was disturbed by the unfettered animosity coursing through the crowd. Best for all of us, then, that he has discovered his better angels.", "---", "by Jon Ronson. Riverhead Books.", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
