For starters, what defines one? No one calls a metronome a drum machine, though several of the machines in Mansfield\u2019s book (the Seeburg Select-a-Rhythm, the Conn Min-O-Matic Rhythm) offer \u201cmetronome\u201d functions, which seems a little like equipping an iPhone with a Dixie-cup-and-string attachment.

Even the name invites a new version of the old joke:", "?", "also offers a glimpse into the drum machine\u2019s imagined possibilities, in emergent, unresolved, often soon-to-be-aborted forms. In the book\u2019s early pages, most machines we see were designed primarily as collections of preset rhythms. Among these are such vague and dusty archaisms as \u201cFoxtrot,\u201d \u201cWatusi,\u201d \u201cTwist,\u201d and my own personal favorite, \u201cTeen.\u201d The Maestro Rhythm King, used by Sly Stone on his 1971 album", "(widely considered the first mainstream album to feature a drum machine), boasts 18 variously colored buttons, each adorned with labels like \u201cCha Cha,\u201d \u201cGo-Go,\u201d \u201cSlow Fox,\u201d and \u201cWestern.\u201d", "And yet by the time Roger Linn introduced his groundbreaking LM-1 Drum Computer in 1979\u2014the first machine to offer digital samples of actual acoustic drums\u2014there was nary a preset rhythm to be found. The LM-1\u2014a machine so powerful that in 1984 it let Prince release \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d without a bass track\u2014contains 18 different individual drum sounds (snares, kicks, hi-hats) and is equipped with a 13-channel mixer. Nothing about the LM-1 is user-friendly or convenient, nor is it meant to be: It is proudly conscious of its own artistry, and that of its prospective users.", "The disappearance of preset rhythms happens gradually through the pages of Mansfield\u2019s book but now strikes me as nothing less than a massive revolution in the understanding of the drum machine, if not even percussion itself. In this disappearance we can see drum machines go from responding to musical trends to", "those trends. The LM-1, the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 (1980 and 1984, respectively), the Oberheim DMX (1982), the E-mu Drumulator (1983): These machines, none of which come with presets and each of which appears on countless pop hits from the 1980s to today, were conceived, and played, as instruments unto themselves. They\u2019re not faux-drummers; they\u2019re real drum kits.", "Photo by Gary Land", "The most influential devotees of these instruments were young musicians working in young genres\u2014hip-hop, house, new wave, et al.\u2014who came to them with little preconceptions or inhibitions.

The prose can be dry and overly technical, and I personally would have liked more historical detail on certain machines, although one doesn\u2019t turn to coffee-table books for comprehensiveness. There\u2019s also not a lot in the book to describe the actual sound of the machines, although by the end I found that silence to be one of its understated triumphs. Rhythm is the hardest element of music to render into words\u2014some mystical combination of sound, space, and time\u2014and in many of these early machines we see this ineffability personified (\u201cTeen\u201d). I sometimes found myself wishing the book came with some sort of comprehensive audio sampler, but that\u2019d be impossible, and that impossibility is the point: Like any great musical instrument, the drum machine\u2019s potential sounds, and songs, are infinite.", "Luckily", "comes with something even better.
