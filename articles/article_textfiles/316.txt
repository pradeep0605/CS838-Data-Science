Why did this young woman kill herself, assuming she was successful? (She was.) Did her father do something to her?

Why was it the last time she saw him? Why did she never speak to him? How does she know this couple? Why doesn\u2019t she know how to spell his last name? Mar\u00edas answers these questions in the end. (Well, all but one, I think.)

She never spoke to them\u2014not while Miguel, the husband, was alive.

The Balzac book is about a soldier who is mistakenly buried with, and listed among, the war dead, and who then tries to return to his old life.
