{"Body": ["Photo by Kosin_Sukhum/iStock/Thinkstock", "Do you ever just want to quote someone forever? Reading Clive James\u2019", ", struggling to find ways to talk about it, I dreamed of Echo, the nymph of Greek myth, who spoke truth by repeating the true words of others. It wasn\u2019t a perfect system: She couldn\u2019t reproduce whole lines or sentences, just the last vanishing bits of speech. But I like to think that the return of those final fragments, the act of reviving them, focused people\u2019s attention. And since heightened concentration is a prerequisite for both reading and writing (about) poetry, I am hoping that James (and Zeus) will smile on this invocation of an unconventional muse to discuss acutely quotable essays on resonant expression, written by a man dying of leukemia whose loosely trussed \u201clast sayings\u201d on poetry may turn out to be the coda that rings on after the music ends.", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "With", "James, the Australian literary critic and", "(and TV reviewer and broadcaster and, to hear the", "sing it,", "), has assembled a series of short essays, many originally penned for", "magazine. They\u2019re brief and fluent\u2014you rocket through, or stroll pensively\u2014but they represent the distillation of years of thought and study, with all the shine of stones smoothed by the rush of river water over time. You might further break down the alloy of James\u2019 style, its properties of aphorism and luster, into three elements: precision, inventiveness, and wit. Precision because of scalpeled epiphanies, like his invocation of \u201cAuden\u2019s knack for a resonant vagueness.\u201d Inventiveness such as his description of a verse by W.J. Turner in which \u201cthe purposeless glitter was packed tight like a second-hand furniture dealer\u2019s storeroom full of chandeliers.\u201d An image in a Gerard Manley Hopkins poem \u201cshift[s] the reader into a layer of enriched oxygen.\u201d Wit! There are Alps of it. Here are three: \u201cLike abstract painting,\u201d James argues, \u201cabstract poetry extended the range over which incompetence would fail to declare itself.\u201d Bits of poems \u201cappear all over the page, like the manufactured evidence of an explosion that had never taken place.\u201d Amid so much portentous noise, \u201cit is forgivable to favour those poets who show signs of knowing what they are saying.\u201d", "All poetry critics are on the hunt for neon-lined, essential truths about their subjects\u2014but James has an uncanny instinct for where to look.", "So precision, inventiveness, and wit (onto his disdain for slobs and obfuscators in a moment)\u2014except the flexible metal of James\u2019 bright coinages contains something else altogether. Call it supercharged insight. \u201cThe trick\u201d of reading Frost, he tells us, \u201cis to avoid the longer poems until the shorter ones have taken over your mind. The longer poems have good things in them, but the self-contained showpiece poems give you his essence, and his essence is one you should learn to recognize before watching him distribute it over the framework of an extended edifice.\u201d This would be an arresting swoop of analysis anywhere because it amounts to such a smart and unexpected way to think about a body of work. But it\u2019s also astonishing because it is so wondrously", ", the sort of revelation anyone who\u2019s read Frost will register in her bones before it even hits her brain.", "All poetry critics are on the hunt for neon-lined, essential truths about their subjects\u2014but James has an uncanny instinct for where to look. It\u2019s precision not just of vocabulary\u2014of intuiting the right words to describe a tone or style\u2014but of thought. James has mastered the mental exactitude it takes to isolate a complex idea. Consider his praise for Sylvia Plath, her \u201cgift for placing a phrase on the music.\u201d Just so. At stake is how a line\u2019s rhythmic propulsion (or", ") can unite with a moment of clear, articulated perception so that the whole thing turns incandescent with energy. For James, crucially, such clarity is neither easy to pull off nor straightforward in its effect on the reader. His lyric ideal is as fine as it is conceptually nuanced: a \u201csimple statement made complex by its own interior music.\u201d", "Several of James\u2019 brilliant critical gestures nonetheless failed to convince me. He complains (in bewitching waves of argumentation!) that Milton weighed down his verse with learning. I would counter that the references in", "and", "create a sense of unique, overwhelming scope. And during an otherwise bravura takedown of Ezra Pound, which smartly knocks Pound\u2019s \u201cfaith that a sufficiently gnomic utterance will yield an unswerving truth,\u201d James impugns the lovely line from Canto LXXIV: \u201cto build the city of Dioce, whose terraces are the colour of stars.\u201d Why? Because we don\u2019t know what color stars are and thus can\u2019t see the terraces. And yet\u2014aren\u2019t images that at once provoke and defy our inner vision an occasional poetic asset? (And we know what color stars are\u2014they\u2019re the color of stars.) Wallace Stevens", ", \u201cShe dreams a little, and she feels the dark/ Encroachment of that old catastrophe,/ As a calm darkens among water-lights.\u201d My personal unwillingness to part with those lines is matched only by my inability to picture a single calm, whatever that is, dimming among water-lights, whatever those are.", "Others will have bigger problems with", ". They\u2019ll say that James is too dismissive of free verse. (He admits to being a \u201cdiehard formalist,\u201d but also concedes that he could be wrong\u2014what matters is the skill with which a poem\u2019s standout moments are fitted together.) Conversely, James suggests that anyone attributing the force and sharpness of T.S. Eliot\u2019s", "to facility with old meters is \u201cbetting on a case of correlation as causation.\u201d (Fighting words! Especially as creative writing professors across the country assign students villanelles because", ")", "You could certainly censure James\u2019 emphasis on white, male poets. He himself acknowledges that weakness, looking forward \u201cto a time when women will dominate the art\u201d and limply noting that \u201cI ended up with almost as many lines by Elizabeth Bishop in my head as Robert Lowell.\u201d Yet political critiques of", ", while wholly justified, seem to miss the point. Surely James, steeped in a waning canon as exclusionary as it is beautiful, can make contributions to the store of poetic knowledge. Surely we can attend to them without ignoring other voices, especially now. \u201cThe sound of a slamming door, but it\u2019s behind you,\u201d he writes, reflecting on his journey \u201cinto the empty regions.\u201d For him as for anyone else, the enemy has always been silence, emptiness, a closed door.", "James favors prose sentences that borrow from poetry\u2019s playbook, balancing between concrete and abstract. \u201cSeidel would have given us the makers of Auden\u2019s tigerish blazer and dovelike shoe,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut he was never impressed enough that Auden didn\u2019t.\u201d (Are we talking about clothes or not?) Yet he is also a keen practitioner of what he calls \u201ckitchen criticism\u201d; he knows his washers and wrenches. \u201cLarkin often used a monosyllabic adjective before a polysyllabic one, with no separating comma,\u201d he observes, before launching into the stratosphere: \u201cThe sonorous glissando of the device was useful to give the pathos of passing time.\u201d James is deeply concerned, too, with the forces binding units together: what makes a self-contained", "rather than stray glints of", ". He loves the \u201csatisfaction\u201d of small \u201cignition points\u201d intensified by the melodic structure that holds them. \u201cPoetry,\u201d he says, \u201ckeeps itself together,\u201d though \u201ceventually we ourselves do not.\u201d", "Photo by Claerwen James", "That\u2019s the issue at the heart of", "how art is long, but life is short, and especially how a lifetime of responding to immortal words can be shaded by intimations of the end.
