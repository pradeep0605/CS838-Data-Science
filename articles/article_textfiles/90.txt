{"Body": ["Sonny Liew", "I\u2019ll admit that I picked up", "the first novel by South African writer Masande Ntshanga, with certain expectations. Because the cover tells us that the main character, a young man called Lindanathi Mda, is HIV-positive (a \u201creactive\u201d) and selling his antiretrovirals on the black market, I hoped for a glimpse into the realities of people living with HIV and AIDS in a country that has been devastated throughout the continuing pandemic. (His surname seems to be an homage to South African playwright and novelist Zakes Mda.) AIDS: It\u2019s the kind of heavy-hitting theme we expect from an African novel\u2014please, educate us! We expect poverty and disease and possibly armed conflict, and we flatten our views of the entire continent much the same way as one of the novel\u2019s minor characters, a French scientist who compresses Africa into a set of health and economic disasters.", "Instead,", "is foremost a novel about Nathi\u2019s grief at the death of his half-brother Luthando (or LT) 10 years earlier in a botched initiation ceremony, one in which Nathi avoided taking part despite promises he\u2019d made to LT. And while AIDS, poverty, and politics are not exactly absent from the story, in genre and tone it has much more in common with familiar stories of young urbans staving off adulthood with the help of controlled and industrial substances\u2014as if Judd Apatow directed", "and set it in Cape Town.", "\u201cTen years ago,\u201d Nathi begins, \u201cI helped a handful of men take my little brother\u2019s life,\u201d before shifting to the story of his dissolute, drug-infused existence in 2003. He and fellow wasters Ruan and Cissie are educated and brainy, from middle-income homes, the first generation of black South Africans to access universities previously closed to them during Apartheid. Ruan\u2019s a computer geek who reads Camus; Cissie\u2019s a teacher and frustrated artist. Nathi studied journalism and science and held a job as a lab tech before he became infected. But the three share a sort of existential dread and uncertainty\u2014or maybe, in less romantic parlance, it\u2019s just depression. They meet at a support group for drug users and people with HIV, which Nathi attends to maintain insurance coverage for his ARVs. (Cissie and Ruan aren\u2019t positive but go for reasons related to their work.) Smirking behind their hands during the group leader\u2019s preachy blather, they form an instant bond.", "What it lacks in plot", "makes up for with the pleasures of the trio\u2019s spaced-out, deeply inward friendship, unspooling as they drift through their days, organized mostly around their shared project to find buyers for Nathi\u2019s ARVs (which he apparently never takes). In between sales, they sniff regular fingernails of \u201cIndustrial\u201d glue, chew stems of khat, smoke crystal, gulp painkillers, stare at the insides of their eyelids, and crisscross Cape Town in crowded taxi-vans. They put up posters advertising their product, wax philosophical, and get a bit nihilist, playing a game called \u201cLast Life,\u201d in which they imagine Nathi\u2019s final year on the planet. It\u2019s all half BS, half serious, classic stoner talk with a nevertheless unfamiliar edge, like Cissie\u2019s observation that they\u2019re all \u201cbasically slaves\u201d:", "The story wafts across the pages like smoke rings as today disintegrates into tomorrow. The state of perpetual suspension suits Lindanathi\u2019s name, which we learn means \u201cwait with us,\u201d and through the novel we wait with him and his friends as they dodge and weave under the disappointments and confusions of early adulthood in a country and city in a state of rapid change.", "Giorgia Fanelli", "The reliable and stuporous lull of the friends\u2019 days is interrupted when an unknown wealthy client contacts them about their ARV supply and makes a large deposit in Ruan\u2019s bank account, a fantastic sum that could, they imagine, remake their stalled lives. At the same time, Nathi starts to receive repeated text messages from his uncle, LT\u2019s stepfather Bhut\u2019 Vuyo, which he would like ignore. The mystery buyer\u2019s hidden motives become the novel\u2019s main narrative engine\u2014insofar as it has one. The unnamed man turns out to be nearly a mythical beast, a man with a badly burnt face and neck who wears a tin mask, speaks and smokes through a device in his neck, issues commands, and transfixes the friends with a series of fables. When they arrive for their second meeting, they find a laptop open and the man on screen, an apparition smoking a cigarette:", "While the three friends pursue the truth about the mystery buyer, a series of family losses weaves through Nathi\u2019s memory: uncles and aunts cut down early by disease or by their own hands, and always, his brother LT\u2014\u201cthe Screamer,\u201d as the village elders mocked him after the botched circumcision that would kill him. AIDS, too, is a ghost that lives among them, and Nathi often comments that he\u2019ll be dead soon, though for now he has few symptoms. He recalls the pedantic lyric cruelty of his boarding school biology teacher, who took flying lessons and came back with a warning for the class: \u201cShe told us how the Earth was gutted open with so many new graves for paupers, that when the clouds parted, they revealed a view from the sky that looked like a giant honeycomb. ... Each grave was meant to contain the bodies of twenty adults. She said to us, that is HIV.\u201d", "Even with its many ghosts and its implicit critique of the South African government at a time when it refused to make ARVs available through the public sector,", "is largely a novel about Nathi fumbling toward meaning. It does not look closely at the AIDS pandemic or at poverty or politics\u2014but politics inform the novel\u2019s conditions. The lives of Nathi and his friends show how history can shape the opportunities, constraints, ambivalences that mark one young life. As he continues to dodge messages from his uncle Bhut\u2019 Vuyo, Nathi finds himself in a confusing space between his present and his past, when something very different was expected of a young man. He remembers when he and LT were harassed by their uncles, \u201cwith their gold teeth and beer breath, and how they\u2019d find the two of us at every family gathering, hoist us on their knees, and goad us about becoming men.\u201d The uncles expected the wrong things from him, a studious boarding-school boy, a kid who \u201cdidn\u2019t know his clan name from his asshole.\u201d", "When Nathi finally agrees to see Bhut\u2019 Vuyo, it turns out that he\u2019s not that kind of uncle. Instead, he might be able to help Nathi complete his long period of grief. Bhut\u2019 Vuyo and his family live in Du Noon township on a crowded block without plumbing where families and businesses house themselves in shipping containers. \u201cIt feels the same as seeing regular poverty,\u201d Nathi thinks, \u201cbut cut into sections and prepared for export.\u201d", "It\u2019s a wonderful line, and his uncle\u2019s family and neighbors are far more stable and probably happier than Nathi\u2019s friends, an unexpectedly sunny vision that fits the tone of a novel that delivers an unexpected love letter to Cape Town, painting it as a place of frustrated glory. For all its moments of stasis,", "often teems with a beauty that seems to carry on in front of its glue-huffing wasters despite themselves. Lindanathi is a close observer of the city sky and roadscapes, whether eating waffles off a paper plate at the beach, smoking weed on a high-rise balcony, or peering through a smeared taxi windowpane. On one of the daily odysseys with his friends, he muses:", "It\u2019s a fear with which every writer has to contend, and one this haunting and seductive novel goes far to disprove.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
