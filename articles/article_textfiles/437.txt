And indeed, if it were just a story, it would be back to front: the narrator has an exciting time in Hell, but Purgatory, when it is not about art, is about theology, and Heaven is about nothing else. What kind of story has all the action in the first third, and then settles back to stage a discussion of obscure spiritual matters? But the", "", "isn\u2019t just a story, it\u2019s a poem: one of the biggest, most varied, and most accomplished poems in all the world. Appreciated on the level of its verse, the thing never stops getting steadily more beautiful as it goes on. T. S. Eliot said that the last cantos of", "were as great as poetry can ever get. The translator\u2019s task is to compose something to suggest that such a judgment might be right.", "is here today because my wife, when we were together in Florence in the mid-1960s, a few years before we were married, taught me that the great secret of Dante\u2019s masterpiece lay in the handling of the verse, which always moved forward even in the most intensely compressed of episodes. She proved this by answering my appeal to have the famous Paolo and Francesca episode in", "5 explained to me from the original text. From various translators including Byron we can see what that passage says. But how did Dante say it? My wife said that the", "was only the outward sign of how the thing carried itself along, and that if you dug down into Dante\u2019s expressiveness at the level of phonetic construction you would find an infinitely variable rhythmic pulse adaptable to anything he wanted to convey. One of the first moments she picked out of the text to show me what the master versifier could do was when Francesca tells Dante what drove her and Paolo over the brink and into the pit of sin. In English it would go something like:", "She read it in Italian:", "After the sound", "\u201d ends the first line, the placing of \u201c-", "\u201d at the start of the second line gives it the power of a rhyme, only more so. How does that happen? You have to look within. The Italian 11-syllable line feels a bit like our standard English iambic pentameter and therefore tends to mislead you into thinking that the", ", the recurring unit of three lines, has a rocking regularity. But Dante isn\u2019t thinking of regularity in the first instance any more than he is thinking of rhyme, which is too easy in Italian to be thought a technical challenge: In fact for an Italian poet it\u2019s", "rhyming that\u2019s hard.", "Dante\u2019s overt rhyme scheme is only the initial framework by which the verse structure moves forward. Within the", ", there is all this other intense interaction going on. (Dante is the greatest exemplar in literary history of the principle advanced by Vernon Watkins, and much approved of by Philip Larkin, that good poetry doesn\u2019t just rhyme at the end of the lines, it rhymes all along the line.) Especially in modern times, translators into English have tended to think that if this interior intensity can be duplicated, the grand structure of the", ", or some equivalent rhymed frame work, can be left out.

But that approach can never transmit the full intensity of the", "", ", which is notable for its overall onward drive as much as for its local density of language.", "Dante is not only tunneling in the depths of meaning, he is working much closer to the surface texture: working within it. Even in the most solemn passage there might occur a touch of delight in sound that comes close to being wordplay.

The rhymes that clinch the", "are a very supplementary music compared to the music going on within the", "\u2019s span.", "Courtesy of Liveright", "The lines, I found, were alive within themselves. Francesca described how, while they were carried away with what they read, Paolo kissed her mouth. \u201c", "(this one right here), she says, \u201c", "", "(kissed my mouth, all trembling). At that stage I had about a hundred words of Italian and needed to be told that the accent on the final", "of \u201c", "was a stress accent and needed to be hit hard, slowing the line so that it could start again and complete itself in the alliterative explosion of \u201c", ".\u201d An hour of this tutorial and I could already see that Dante was paying attention to his rhythms right down to the structure of the phrase and even of the word.", "The linked rhymes of the", "were a gesture toward form, marking the pulse of the onward surge of the great story, which was driven by its poetry; and would be infinitely less great without its poetry, just as Wagner\u2019s", "cycle would be infinitely less great without its music. But Dante\u2019s formal requirements for himself went down to the very basics of the handling of language. It was all very precise, and yet it all added up. Though it was assembled from minutely wrought effects, the episode really did have rhythmic sweep.
