Eckford looks dignified and serious. Behind her stands a snarling white girl, described by Nancy Isenberg in her new book,", "as \u201cthe face of white trash. Ignorant. Unrepentant. Congenitally cruel. Only capable of replicating the life into which she was born.\u201d The girl, whose name was Hazel Bryan, had a history to back up that stereotype. She grew up in a house without indoor plumbing, with parents who had never graduated from high school themselves and a father who beat her. Later on, she would drop out of school, marry, and move into the quintessential domicile of the American white underclass in the 20", "century: a trailer.", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "A less familiar element of this story is R.C. Hall High, built on the west side of Little Rock for the city\u2019s affluent white families\u2014and nicknamed \u201cCadillac High.\u201d Unlike Central, whose students were working class, Cadillac High was not selected for desegregation in 1957. An opponent of the action complained that the \u201conly race-mixing that is going to be done is in the districts where the so-called rednecks live.\u201d The man was a racist, but he wasn\u2019t wrong on that point. What happened in Little Rock is typically portrayed as a binary opposition\u2014black vs. white\u2014but the truth was a three-party affair: blacks vs. rednecks vs. white elites. Call it a hate triangle.", "offers a deep-diving history of people like Bryan going all the way back to the first European incursions into the Americas. From the founding of the Jamestown settlement to the present day, Isenberg insists, America has always had a class hierarchy and has never offered equal opportunity to all (white) comers. A history professor at Louisiana State University, she writes, \u201cMost colonizing schemes that took root in 17", "- and 18", "-century British America were built on privilege and subordination, not any kind of proto-democracy.\u201d The rich, powerful and well-connected men behind those schemes stocked their ships and settlements with \u201cexpendable people\u2014waste people,\u201d typically indentured servants bound to work off the price of their passage, workers who could be used up in taming the wilderness. The authorities back in England welcomed such plans as a way to drain Britain of its human dregs: convicts, vagrants, the orphaned children of paupers. If the hard work didn\u2019t redeem them, the hard conditions would eliminate them.", "Tapping into scores of sources, Isenberg traces the emergence of the white-trash stereotype from its roots in British beliefs that the working class was truly a separate race from the middle and upper classes: congenitally stupid, lazy and shiftless\u2014when they weren\u2019t sly and conniving. Poverty, in the form of miserable living conditions, dirtiness, ignorance, illness, violence, and despair, was viewed as the inherited misfortune of blighted bloodlines. Isenberg shows how consistent this prejudice has been over the centuries, carrying on with only a few alterations", ".", "The first few chapters of", "can be heavy sledding due to the density of information and occasional clumsiness of Isenberg\u2019s prose. (\u201cIf [Benjamin] Franklin thought of class as principally conditioned by demography\u2014the human compulsion to seek pleasure and avoid pain\u2014 \u2026 \u201d begins one sentence, nonsensically.) She organizes the material around significant figures, founders like Franklin and President Thomas Jefferson, as well as theorists, scientists, landowners, politicians, administrators, and artists. It\u2019s when she gets around to President Andrew Jackson that things pick up.", "Jackson, aka \u201cOld Hickory,\u201d campaigned as the embodiment of the backwoodsman \u201ccracker\u201d spirit, as his critics put it, even though by the time he was elected he\u2019d become a slave-owning planter just like the wealthy elites who had bamboozled or bullied so many freeholders out of their small plots. He lacked \u201cstatesmanlike qualities\u201d and he failed even to defend his lower-class constituency from the depredations of the upper crust. But the fact that \u201cJackson did not look or act like a conventional politician,\u201d Isenberg writes, \u201cwas a fundamental part of his appeal.\u201d He was boastful and overbearing, not \u201ca government minion or a pampered courtier,\u201d an outsider who promised to clean up Washington corruption by the bluntest methods available. As one of his enemies wrote, \u201cboisterous in ordinary conversation, he makes up in oaths what he lacks in arguments.\u201d A ruthless and successful general, Jackson was \u201cquick to resent any who disagreed with him,\u201d and eschewed reasoned debate in favor of challenging his opponents to duels.", "This, of course, sounds awfully familiar. If", "is rather weak at weaving its assorted elements into a coherent narrative, it sheds bright light on a long history of demagogic national politicking, beginning with Jackson. It makes Donald Trump seem far less unprecedented than today\u2019s pundits proclaim. When it came to reining in the big landowners, Jackson betrayed the economic interests of working-class whites but won their favor all the same by prosecuting a brutal Native American removal policy, targeting unpopular, powerless \u201cbarbarians.\u201d His rough ways endeared him to the humble folk whose interests he couldn\u2019t be bothered to defend. When opponents ridiculed his partisans for their lack of \u201ctaste and breeding,\u201d it only sweetened his victories in that constituency\u2019s eyes.", "One of Andrew Jackson\u2019s enemies wrote, \u201cboisterous in ordinary conversation, he makes up in oaths what he lacks in arguments.\u201d", "Jackson employed what Isenberg dubs the \u201cArkansas Traveller\u201d strategy for winning over the white rural poor. The name comes from a mid-19", "-century folktale about a city slicker journeying through the backcountry who comes upon a squatter sitting in front of his hovel. The slicker repeatedly asks the squatter for information, help and/or refreshment\u2014and gets nothing but evasive answers. It\u2019s only after the slicker proves his down-home cred by picking up a fiddle and sawing out a hillbilly tune that the squatter welcomes him and provides what he needs. Generations of politicians would follow this formula by posing for photos with hogs, or mules, or crooning hill-country ballads to win votes. An Australian visitor Isenberg quotes dubbed America, \u201c \u2018a democracy of manners,\u2019 which was not the same as real democracy.\u201d", "If Andrew Jackson was the first \u201cwhite trash\u201d presidential candidate, Trump is surely the most recent despite the paradox presented by his wealthy urban upbringing. He has followed Jackson\u2019s playbook where he can, updating other chapters for the post-industrial 21", "century. In place of a martial career spent whuppin\u2019 redcoats, Trump crows about his prowess in the battlefield of business. He manfully rejects the lily-livered politesse of the snooty, educated classes who look down on him and his followers. His policies matter less than his personal style, because his selling point is not what he will accomplish but who he will gleefully offend and bulldoze. Instead of dutifully adopting upper-class tastes and decorum, he is, like Elvis, empowered by his wealth to flaunt his vulgarity. Even the springboard of his fame among the white working-class\u2014reality television\u2014is one of the few mass-culture arenas where rednecks can win renown just for being their unapologetically trashy selves.", "And, like Jackson and his successors, Trump has singled out dark-skinned others as a threat to the American way of life. White Trash\u00a0is weakest in its handling of race, a theme intimately entangled with the notion of a white-trash identity, but a subject Isenberg avoids when at all possible. Slavery was an institution that benefited rich plantation owners to the catastrophic disadvantage of small farmers and free laborers; it made the rich richer and the poor poorer. The Confederate Army, which granted service exemptions to slaveholders and other elite Southern whites, consisted largely of subsistence farmers and other workers expected to fight to preserve the very economic system that had kept them down. Many deserted. One Alabama recruit said, \u201cThey think all you are fit for is to stop bullets for them, your betters, who call you poor white trash.\u201d Many of those so-called betters ranked poor white trash as equivalent to, if not lower than, slaves. After the war, two-thirds of the farmers who worked the South\u2019s land under the bone-breaking, dead-end system of sharecropping were poor whites.", "Yet, for all that the South\u2019s white underclass resented the elites, they nevertheless allowed themselves, in great numbers, to be manipulated into believing that blacks and other people of color were their real enemies. Even politicians who identified and sympathized with poor whites found this exasperating. President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose Great Society program focused on helping not only urban blacks but also the crushingly impoverished whites of Appalachia, told a reporter, \u201cIf you can convince the lowest white man he\u2019s better than the best colored man, he won\u2019t notice you\u2019re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\u201d", "Isenberg clearly means", "to be a rebuke for generations of middle- and upper-class Americans who write off poor rural whites as worthless and blame their miserable, marginalized existence not on poverty and civic neglect but on bad genes and weak character.", "during the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998 when she called Bill Clinton \u201cour first black president,\u201d the attributes Clinton\u2019s haters found so revoltingly white-trash about him\u2014\u201csingle-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald\u2019s-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\u201d\u2014replicate the \u201ctropes of blackness.\u201d In addition to being slapped with virtually the same stereotypes, poor blacks and poor whites have, as Isenberg observes, \u201csimilar economic interests.\u201d But the one trait now most commonly associated with white trash\u2014overt, vicious racism\u2014keeps them at odds.", "\"Yet, for all that the South\u2019s white underclass resented the elites, they nevertheless allowed themselves, in great numbers, to be manipulated into believing that blacks and other people of color were their real enemies.", "", "", "", "", "Writing for the", "after the June 2015 mass shooting that killed nine black worshippers from a Charleston, South Carolina, church, Frank Guan", "that the murderer would most likely be called \u201cwhite trash.\u201d", "This, he argued, allows higher-status whites to ignore the structural nature of white supremacy and to pretend that \u201canti-black racism is purely the province of accented simpletons in greasy overalls.\u201d While this argument is true, it misses how easily the formula reverses itself, how the overt racism expressed by underclass whites gives educated, middle-class Americans permission to disregard the entrenched deprivation, fear, and hopelessness that foments it. It\u2019s a mistake to think class prejudice, whatever form it takes, can\u2019t be as visceral as racism. If you are a disgusting, contemptible racist and display it shamelessly, it\u2019s easy to view you and everyone like you as beyond the pale of humanity.
