Early in the play, as Avery and Sam sweep out the theater, Avery, who\u2019s only 20, asks Sam what he thinks he\u2019ll do when he grows up. Avery\u2019s impulse to ask the question makes sense; he\u2019s still trying to discover who he is. But Sam\u2019s 35, and he knows how incomplete he is, and he has not quite made peace with it, so I felt along with him the impulse to be offended at the question\u2014and then the restraint it takes him to simply say, after a long pause, \u201c... I am grown up.\u201d He adds: \u201cThat\u2019s like the most depressing thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me.\u201d But then, as they walk out of the theater, he says: \u201cA chef.\u201d Brain-directing the scene, I mentally underlined that detail, planning for the moment it comes back\u2014maybe Sam goes to cooking classes and meets a nice girl and opens a restaurant.
