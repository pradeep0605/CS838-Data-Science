The group has also organized festivals in Israel and Mali, acquiring some familiarity with challenging situations abroad. Their first festival in Port-au-Prince, planned as part of bicentennial celebrations of Haitian independence in 2004, was postponed thanks to the violent collapse of the Haitian government that year, and eventually took place in 2007. Most members of the 2010 advance team had helped organize the 2007 event as well. By 2010, things in Haiti were finally looking up.", "\u201cLife seems to have gotten back to normal after decades of trouble,\u201d Laferri\u00e8re writes in his surprisingly calm and measured new memoir,", ".", "Laughing girls stroll through the streets late into the evening. Painters of na\u00efve canvases chat with women selling mangos and avocados on dusty street corners. Crime seems to have retreated. In lower-class Bel-Air, criminals aren\u2019t tolerated by a population exasperated by everything it has gone through over the last fifty years: family dictatorships, military coups, repeated hurricanes, devastating floods, and random kidnappings.", "For the first time in a decade or more, political turmoil had receded from the Haitian consciousness, leaving space for the country\u2019s extraordinary rich reserves of literature, music, and visual art to claim attention. In the background of Laferri\u00e8re\u2019s street-level observations there were more promising developments. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val\u2019s administration looked far more stable than any of its recent predecessors, while Obama\u2019s administration in Washington was far more friendly to its Caribbean neighbor than previous U.S. governments had been. The new empowerment of the Clintons, Hillary as secretary of state and Bill as United Nations special envoy to Haiti, bids fair to clear a new pathway toward durable economic development, again for the first time in 15 years or longer.", "That afternoon, Laferri\u00e8re was in a restaurant. He had just ordered the lobster. \u201cI was biting into a piece of bread when I heard a terrible explosion,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe had between eight and ten seconds to make a decision. Leave the place or stay. Very rare were those who got a good start. \u2026 The three of us ended up flat on the ground in the middle of the courtyard, under the trees. The earth started shaking like a sheet of paper whipped by the wind. The low roar of buildings falling to their knees. They didn\u2019t explode; they imploded, trapping people inside their bellies.\u201d", "Laferri\u00e8re always has two items on his person: his passport and \u201ca black notebook in which I write down everything that crosses my field of vision or my mind.\u201d", "is constructed as an anthology of these immediate impressions, recorded from the moment when \u201cWe slowly got to our feet like zombies in a B-movie,\u201d to begin exploring a country that had just had its recent hopes of progress sliced out from under it. \u201cIn less than a minute, some saw their lifelong dreams go up in smoke. That cloud in the sky a while back was the dust of their dreams.\u201d", "After Edwidge Danticat, Dany Laferri\u00e8re is probably the best known Haitian writer on the North American continent. His reputation in the United States is hampered by the fact that he writes in French and his works appear here only in translation. Despite a long-standing and fertile collaboration with translator David Homel, some things inevitably do get lost: for example the title of his seminal work,", "was, in", ", truncated to", "First published in Montreal in 1985, this book covers some of the same ground as works like Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s", ", though in a distinctly different manner.", "\u201cPut black vengeance and white guilt together in the same bed and you had a night to remember!\u201d Laferri\u00e8re wrote in", ". \u201cThose blond-haired, pink-cheeked girls practically had to be dragged out of the black dormitories. The Big Nigger from Harlem fucked the stuffing out of the girlfriend of the Razor Blade King, the whitest, most arrogant racist on campus \u2026 The Young White Girl gets off too. It\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s manifested such high-quality hatred toward her. In the sexual act, hatred is more effective than love.\u201d", "There\u2019s plenty of anger here to be sure (much of which was reflected back on the author), but something else to leaven the vitriol: Laferri\u00e8re\u2019s slyly witty, satirical tone, finally more reminiscent of Ishmael Reed than Cleaver. Like many Haitian and Haitian-American writers, Laferri\u00e8re regards the extremes of human folly he reports with a particular eye-of-the-hurricane calm. Developed by a core of Haitian intellectuals as well as by many ordinary Haitians, this attitude is a survival response to the whirlwind forces of their general situation, and also turns out to be quite useful for living through the ravages of the 2010 earthquake psychologically intact.", "The confessional qualities of Laferri\u00e8re\u2019s memoir are muted, though he does let us know that, while riding out the initial shock on the heaving surface of his hotel courtyard, he \u201cwondered if the earth would gape open and swallow us up. That was my childhood terror.\u201d He speaks, in general, of \u201cthose who are deeply damaged inside but don\u2019t know it yet. \u2026 Those people have hidden the screams inside them. One day they will implode.\u201d More personally, he writes in the days following the quake:", "I felt a good strong shock. My breath gone. Sweating already. \u2026 My legs were weak. I went back to the table once I\u2019d gotten hold of myself. The same atmosphere as before. Nothing indicated there\u2019d been a tremor. I can\u2019t be the only one who felt it. People are going to mention it. I just need to wait. The conversations were as lively as ever. Finally I understood that my body had shaken, not the earth.", "Courtesy Douglas and McIntyre.", "Laferri\u00e8rre has a lucid plain-style which may remind American readers of the best of Ernest Hemingway, specifically Hemingway\u2019s commitment to writing about the actions that produce emotion, rather than about feelings themselves. Francophone readers may be more immediately reminded of C\u00e9line. The style is well adapted to conditions of shock: \u201cWe gaze at Port-au-Prince with the stunned air of a child whose toy has just been accidentally stepped on by an adult.\u201d In the face of overwhelming catastrophe, Laferri\u00e8re\u2019s simplicity is disarming:", "She\u2019s the first thing I see on the road to P\u00e9tionville. A mango vendor sitting with her back against a wall, a dozen mangos spread out before her. This is her livelihood. For her, there\u2019s nothing new. It doesn\u2019t occur to me to buy from her, though I love mangos. I hear Saint-\u00c9loi\u2019s voice behind me: \u201cWhat a country!\u201d These people are so used to finding life in difficult conditions that they could bring hope down to hell.", "In the international press and aid-worker communities, the aftermath of the quake provoked more nattering than usual about the extraordinary and admirable resilience of the Haitian people in times of crisis, crisis being their near-constant condition, almost needless to say. Simultaneously, there was a rise of complaint about that increasingly well-laminated clich\u00e9, sometimes on the part of the same people who voiced it in the first place. Like many clich\u00e9s, this one is founded on stubbornly persistent fact.", "The glimpses Laferri\u00e8re records of people on the devastated streets of Port-au-Prince accrue to give a deeper substance to the idea of Haitian indomitability. These quickly captured images are somehow more powerful than the words of which they are composed. In the end he is able to grapple with the idea of Haitian resilience in the abstract far more successfully than most. \u201cIn Haiti,\u201d he writes, \u201cif you\u2019re frightened one minute, you\u2019re dancing the next. This tried-and-true method keeps people from sinking into collective depression.\u201d And, later, he continues this notion: \u201cSeeing their serenity, you can imagine how much they know about pain, hunger, and death, and how much violent joy lives inside them. Joy and pain are transformed in singing and in dance. \u2026 If we listen more carefully, we might be surprised to discover that the words that got us up on the dance floor are achingly sad. That\u2019s where the secret of this country resides.\u201d", "The form of this book is both circumstantially and intentionally fragmentary at the start: The reader follows a shocked sensibility as it picks up shards from the wreckage and gradually begins to assemble them into a mosaic. This process of composition is an image of how Haiti must reconstruct itself\u2014from the inside. The country is too often assumed to be a backward place: The First World has trouble remembering that Haitians were two centuries ahead of us in abolishing slavery and in extending full rights of citizenship to everyone, regardless of race. The former slaves who founded the first independent black state in the Western Hemisphere did it their own way, without any assistance or encouragement from surrounding international powers. It should be no real surprise that the templates for reform, progress, and democratization imported to Haiti more recently tend to fit very poorly. The apparently desultory structure of Laferri\u00e8re\u2019s memoir reflects the style in which Haitians have always got their business done.", "A great many voyagers have been astonished by Haiti, and some have benefited from the experience, and some have brought benefits to the country. The explosion of interest and sympathy that followed the earthquake involved enormous amounts of genuine, sincere, and poorly informed good will. It takes patience for learning new ways for any outsider to stay the course in Haiti. Outsiders who have that patience, plus a considerable openness of mind, can do some real good in the country, but, inevitably, most of them don\u2019t. \u201cWe got used to being the planet\u2019s center of attention too quickly,\u201d Laferri\u00e8re writes. \u201cWhere are the cameras now? Elsewhere, for there are other nations who have been waiting to warm themselves by that artificial fire.\u201d", "---", "by Dany Laferri\u00e8re.
