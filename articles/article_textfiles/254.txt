A man\u2019s facial hair is an ambiguous stylistic feature\u2014it registers both as a natural occurrence and a personal choice\u2014and because shaving is now encoded as the cultural default among the Western white men who see themselves as the standard-bearers, a man who rocks a beard makes a statement. The bearded man represents \u201cmale dignity in an age of increasing gender equity,\u201d Oldstone-Moore writes. \u201cThere is often talk of expressing one\u2019s authentic self.\u201d", "That\u2019s an old line. Early beard theorists charted scientific links between facial hair and the very essence of manliness. In ancient Greece, Oldstone-Moore writes, Hippocrates and his contemporaries believed in a masculine life force they called \u201cvital heat,\u201d", "an invention they leveraged to justify claims of natural male superiority in strength, reason, and beard growth. (The history of beards could also be seen as a history of men making irrational arguments to prove their superior faculties of reason.) These guys also believed that semen was stored inside the head, that it drained to the face when a man assumed a missionary sexual position, and that it bloomed, when fertilized with a generous serving of vital heat, into a beard. By 1603, Italian philosopher Marco Antonio Olmo had figured out where semen comes from, but he floated a more psychic connection between chin and crotch, calling facial hair the outward-facing manifestation of a man\u2019s \u201cgenital spirits.\u201d (The \u201c", "\u201d movement, which encourages November mustache growth to raise awareness of prostate and testicular cancer, is a modern callback.) Centuries later, the bearded, balding Charles Darwin would again affirm the sexual potency of the beard, claiming that male facial hair emerged as an evolutionarily advantageous ornament for attracting women. Freudians agreed: Beards were the dicks of the face.", "But they were also the windows to the soul. Though Charlemagne was a mustache guy, he was often depicted in art with a curled white beard, even contemporaneously. The artistic license, Oldstone-Moore writes, was made with an effort at telling \u201cthe story of his soul\u201d rather than reflecting his physical reality.\u00a0 (Centuries later, the coining of \u201c", "\u201d would winkingly recall the association.) Other creative artistic depictions of facial hair reflected changes in the Zeitgeist: Jesus Christ was first depicted as a smooth-cheeked cherub in the style of an ancient Greek hero or god, and only sprouted his iconic beard centuries later when religious leaders called up a scruffy Son of God to emphasize the primacy of gender roles, even in the afterlife. Members of some religious sects even shaved their faces in the hopes of focusing their efforts on cultivating what they called \u201cthe inner beard.\u201d The man who stroked his beard in thought was perceived as accessing his very essence.", "Photo by Matthew J Cline", "Beard theory had political uses as well. As Oldstone-Moore notes, \u201cphilosophers were history\u2019s first pro-beard lobby,\u201d and they fought off the influence of clean-shaven clergy or feminist women by crafting theories that hinged on their hairlines. Christopher Columbus\u2019 contemporaries viewed facial hair as primitive and uncivilized until the scraggly sailors caught sight of the smooth-faced denizens of the \u201cNew World,\u201d and what do you know? All of a sudden, white guys were heralding beards as a sign of sophistication. And the 1862 pro-beard tract", ", written just after the dawn of the American women\u2019s rights movement, posited that facial hair protected the man\u2019s mouth and throat in order to grease his higher purpose: \u201cIt is the man\u2019s duty to teach with his voice,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is the woman\u2019s to \u2018learn in silence.\u2019 \u201d", "The popularity of the beard ebbs and flows at the pace of social change, but at certain points in history, laws or harassment campaigns have accelerated the cycle.
