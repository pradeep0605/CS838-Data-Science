Is he claiming transcendent, transformative effects only for rock, exclusive to other music? He rarely refers to music that isn\u2019t British or American\u2014nor does he reach back to pre-rock popular music, aside from the canonical blues and old-time country. This kind of rock exceptionalism is a tad imperious, a manner not unfamiliar in baby boomers. And Marcus\u2019 signature style of cultural synthesis sometimes reduces difference to likeness.
