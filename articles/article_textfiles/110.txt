{"Body": ["Image Comics", "In the wee hours of the morning after Halloween, 1988, a paper delivery girl named Erin sets out on her route in a sleepy Ohio town, autumn leaves crunching beneath the wheels of her bike as an odd red comet streaks through the sky. She soon encounters several older teenage boys dressed in lackluster monster costumes still milling through the neighborhood; within moments, they\u2019ve gotten physically and even sexually aggressive. One of them grabs the handlebars of her bike, demanding a free paper, and refuses to let her leave.", "That\u2019s when the rest of the paper girl posse arrives, weapons like field hockey sticks slung across their backs. The ringleader of the boys tries his intimidation game again but falters under the crude insults and steely gaze of three tween girls named Mac, KJ, and Tiffany. He ultimately slinks away, tossing an impotent middle finger in their direction.", "Meet the heroes of", "a comic-book series created by star writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Cliff Chiang that opens with a familiar premise: a nostalgia-rich story about coming of age in the 1980s. Except that instead of the boy heroes that typically dominate \u201980s adventures,", "is centrally concerned with the lives and relationships of adolescent girls.", "Image Comics", "It\u2019s an unfamiliar sight in a medium that has historically felt like one long failure of the Bechdel test, particularly in a mainstream title by an A-list creator like Vaughan. Having an adolescent girl as the star of a comic book\u2014particularly one who isn\u2019t sexualized\u2014is unusual enough; having four preteens girls and their friendships with each other take center stage feels as rare a cosmic event as that red comet. But", "is part of a larger sea change in the way women and girls are treated in comics, both on the page and off. The recent Eisner Award nominations boasted a record 61 nods to female creators while last year", "\u2014a prize focused on small press work\u2014was a woman. That\u2019s not even to mention the hugely popular books by female cartoonists like", "and", ", whose work continues to dominate the", "graphic novel best-seller list.", "Institutional change at Marvel and DC has been slower than the shifts in the indie scene, but the kinds of tone-deaf, objectifying portrayals of women that were once unremarkable are now routinely greeted by online backlash that has grown hard to ignore. Women in the comics industry are still underrepresented and routinely face hostility and harassment, but they are nonetheless more visible, more vocal, and more numerous than ever before.", "Vaughan, who has also written for television shows like", "and", ", is a prominent name in the comics world, thanks to his work on several very celebrated books that he co-created with women. He and artist Pia Guerra created", ", a best-selling comic that imagined an Earth populated entirely by women after a plague wiped out all men save one; more recently, he and artist Fiona Staples created", ", an interspecies alien love story that tackled the trials of marriage and parenthood\u2014and once became the target of controversy for", ". But Vaughan told me that he still felt his existing work hadn\u2019t pushed the envelope far enough when it came to gender. In the aftermath of his success with", ", he wanted to go further.", "\u201cI wanted to take a chance,\u201d said Vaughan. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed writing female characters, but sometimes it feels like even when they\u2019re protagonists, they\u2019re still defined by their relationships with male characters. I wanted to write about girls who could just be characters on their own, who weren\u2019t defined by their interactions with men.\u201d", "evokes a similar thrill as many of the best kids\u2019 films of the \u201980s: Instead of looking at childhood through a rosy, sanitized lens, it makes being 12 feel exactly as dangerous and exciting as it truly is. There\u2019s a frisson of excitement in the swear words and threats and unsupervised moments of childhood, a sense of being both invincible and intensely vulnerable. The story features smoking, swearing, and fighting, drunk step-parents, and a handgun that makes its way into the hands of our young protagonists. Mac and her friends aren\u2019t \u201cnice\u201d girls, per se\u2014or rather, they aren\u2019t captive to the tyranny of niceness that so often constricts female characters, particularly young ones. Instead, they bristle and crackle with a transgressive spark, riding through the empty streets, smoking cigarettes, and chattering on walkie-talkies before the sun comes up. It\u2019s a vision of adolescent freedom that feels both exhilarating and somewhat alien in the era of the helicopter parent. \u201cWe were this generation of latchkey kids,\u201d said Vaughan. \u201cWe were the last generation, I think.\u201d", "In that first issue, as the girls cruise past through a pitch-perfect \u201980s neighborhood holding brick-size Walkmen and passing \u201cBush \u201988\u201d campaign signs on nearby lawns, it feels like", "is shaping up as a simple slice-of-life period piece about four preteen girls in small town Ohio, a tougher, more dangerous", "That\u2019s when the alien invasion begins.", "Or at least that\u2019s how it seems: Parents disappear into thin air, deformed figures wrapped in black bandages start lumbering through the streets, the skies fill with monsters, and the surface of time itself gets sliced into venetian blinds. The four girls are left to deal with this bewildering and terrifying new reality all on their own, without any adults who can offer them answers. The situation remains equally opaque to readers, and even by the end of the first story arc (out now in a paperback collection) it\u2019s not entirely clear what\u2019s going on, who the bad guys are, or even when certain events take place. According to Vaughan, that\u2019s by design.", "\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be confused now, but just know that we\u2019re not. We know what we\u2019re building to,\u201d said Vaughan. \u201cWe wanted to simulate how it feels to be 12\u2014you\u2019re so hyper-attuned to what\u2019s going on in the world, but you don\u2019t have access to the knowledge of what\u2019s really happening. I didn\u2019t understand what was going on with the Cold War, but I knew there was a chance that we might all die. You feel very alive, but it\u2019s also totally terrifying.\u201d", "Despite this focus on adolescent life in 1988,", "resists being a pure nostalgia-fest. (One issue opens with a line of alien text that translates as \u201cNOSTALGIA IS DEATH.\u201d) Rather than serving yet another fat slice of recycled childhood to thirty- and fortysomethings, it aims to be a book that either a 40-year-old or a 12-year-old could pick up and enjoy, and the retro setting feels crucial to this goal. \u201cI always think of seeing", "with my dad,\u201d said Vaughan. \u201cThat was a movie about people my dad\u2019s age, set when they were 12. In some ways, it felt like,", ", but it was also like,", ". I think being 12 is somewhat universal.\u201d", "If there\u2019s one thing mainstream comic book readers are accustomed to, however, it\u2019s seeing universal experiences reflected almost reflexively through male characters. Although it was created by an all-male team\u2014and features mostly white characters\u2014the delights of", "are still more evidence that the arc of change in comics is bending toward more diverse, better stories. Instead of pandering to the antiquated desires of male fans who prefer that their entertainment resemble a hall of mirrors,", "is a reminder of how fresh and accessible even the most familiar stories and tropes can feel when people who have been consigned to the sidelines of popular entertainment take center stage.", "\u201cComic book readers are the most nostalgic people ever,\u201d says Vaughan. Many of them \u201cjust want to keep reading what they were reading when they were 12. But there are some people who just love the medium and want to read something new.\u201d", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
