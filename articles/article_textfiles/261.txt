The generous helping of politically conservative histories by Glenn Beck and Bill O\u2019Reilly caused concern, but some historians noticed another troubling trend: The list was dominated by male authors. Of 23 titles, two were written by women.", "Is popular history still a male preserve, in terms of authorship and subject matter? We decided to find out. Inspired by the", ", which tallies bylines at major literary and intellectual magazines to see how many women can be found in their author pools, we looked at author gender among history books published for general readers in 2015. We also wanted to know more about content and approach. Is it true that most popular history books are about presidents and war, or is that just our perception? Are the Nazis as omnipresent as they seem to be? How many biographies are written about men, and how many about women? Do the Founding Fathers have an iron grip on the genre?", "We examined a set of 614 works of popular history from 80 houses, which either published books we defined as trade history or landed books we defined as trade history on the", "Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction best-seller list in 2015. (For our full methodology,", ".) We found that 75.8 percent of the total titles had male authors. Interestingly, the effect was slightly less pronounced among titles that made the", "best-seller", "list\u2014but only slightly (70.4 percent of those authors were male). University press and trade imprints had roughly the same proportion of male to female authors. The persistence of this imbalance, even among authors writing for presses that publish more academics, seems to reflect a continuing gender disparity among academic historians. In 2010, Robert Townsend of the American Historical Association", "that among four-year college and university history faculty surveyed in 2007, only 35 percent were women.", "", "A new\u00a0Slate Academy\u00a0goes back to the classics.

Their subjects were 71.7 percent male, with the list dominated by big names like Richard Nixon, Winston Churchill, and Napoleon Bonaparte. While some of the biographies of men were written by women (13 percent), female authors were far more likely than male writers to write biographies about women. Sixty-nine percent of female biography authors wrote about female subjects, and there was a huge gap between this number and the 6 percent of male biography authors who wrote about women. Clearly, there is some relationship between the gender of authors of biographies and the gender of their subjects.", "Why does this matter? Academics are interested in cultural and social history because those approaches allow room for contemplation of what it was like to live life as an everyday person in a certain period, not just as a general or president or pioneer. Last year, historian Ann M. Little", "that the best-selling biographies of 2014 tended to be about men\u2014and a particular kind of man, at that. Popular biographies of Founding Fathers and war heroes, wrote Little, \u201creflect our contemporary preoccupation with modern history themes: politics, economics, warfare, the nation-state. \u2026 These biographies are invested in a particularly modern kind of subjectivity, that of the heroic individual who bends history to his will.\u201d In other words, the popularity of biographies of presidents and sports heroes reflects and reinforces the idea that interesting lives are lived in public, often defined by conflict and glory. Cultural and social histories make the meta-point that history is about communities, not just individuals.", "Thirty-two percent of books in the pool met one of our criteria for being what we dubbed an \u201cuncle book\u201d: about a president, the founding era, the Civil War, World War II, Abraham Lincoln, or royalty. There were fewer total books about presidents (8.6 percent) and the founding era (3.7 percent) than we had guessed there might be. Our hunch about the American fascination with the executive branch was correct, though: of the", "books, 21.1 percent were about presidents. In the 150", "year since his assassination, Lincoln was king: His name appeared in the title or subject headings for 68.8 percent of the total of those books.", "Even given Lincoln\u2019s popularity in 2015, there weren\u2019t as many books bearing Civil War keywords as we\u2019d anticipated (only 3.9 percent), but 13.5 percent of the total pool of titles had a World War II keyword in the title or subject headings (World War II; Hitler\u201d; \u201cNazi; 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945). That period exerts a powerful pull on the market, fitting many of the perceived criteria for best-selling popular history: It\u2019s a war, with all of wartime\u2019s opportunity for adventure and narrative; it was recent enough to have happened within living memory, and within a historical paradigm that doesn\u2019t require too much contextual explanation; the event continues to yield new approaches and angles; and the war offers clear and uncontroversial lines of good and evil. Even in a centenary year, World War I, with its much less clear-cut historical story and its diminished level of American involvement, did not account for nearly as many books; only 3.7 percent of our pool contained variants of World War I keywords in their titles.", "Our data set revealed some answers about the publishing of popular history that we expected: Authors are largely male, biographical subjects too; \u201cuncle books\u201d make up a third of the total titles published. But the data also raise interesting questions. Is it possible to sell biographies of unfamous people? Why are some historical episodes that fit some of the criteria we outlined above, like the Vietnam War, so absent? And when will World War II ever stop being interesting?", "We shared some of our results with editors, agents, authors, and publishers who work on trade history books, and asked for their impressions. On the whole, the people we spoke with were unsurprised by the gender gap in our data set. \u201cI tend to find that most of my history authors are male, too. That\u2019s certainly not by conscious design but it does seem to be the pattern,\u201d Andrew Miller, an editor at Knopf, wrote in an email. Lara Heimert, the publisher of Basic Books, added in her own emailed reply: \u201cThere is no question that there is a real problem with gender imbalance in trade history publishing. It is something I worry about a lot.\u201d", "Heimert, who has been publishing history books for almost 20 years, posited that received ideas about the market govern publishers\u2019 decisions. \u201cThe conventional wisdom has been that men read more non-fiction and women read more fiction, though as with most conventional wisdom in publishing (and life) I\u2019ve never actually seen a study proving that to be true,\u201d she wrote. Well-founded or not, these truisms drive production of trade history books. In history publishing in particular, Heimert wrote, schedules are \u201corganized around gift-giving seasons\u2014Christmas and \u2018dads and grads\u2019 (Fathers\u2019 Day and graduation)\u2014which is to say that we assume many of our big history books are bought as gifts, and specifically as gifts for men.\u201d", "Asked about the biographical gender gap, Nancy Toff, an editor at Oxford University Press, said over Skype, \u201cI love to publish women\u2019s biography. I did a", ",", ". I love to do it. But it doesn\u2019t tend to sell very well, overall. I think that is a fair statement.\u201d Offering some explanations for the maleness of our pool of biographies, Toff said, \u201cWhen you think about the topics that sell the best, you have sports\u2014those are mostly, if not all, men. Then you have political biographies. Presidents, so far, are all male.\u201d Toff could, however, think of several key exceptions to this rule\u2014", ", by Rachel Hope Cleves, did well as a trade book for Oxford in 2014, as did the Brown biography.", "Even if one-third of our data set was made up of stereotypical uncle books, we were cautiously excited about the two-thirds of the titles that didn\u2019t fit that profile, yet made it to market nonetheless. A few people we queried offered some reasons to hope that the situation might be improving, allowing for more diversity in subject matter. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sense that books on World War II and the Civil War, or presidential biographies, tend to be somewhat more reliable than other categories,\u201d Andrew Miller wrote. \u201cBut I think publishers are always looking for something different in addition to those more familiar books.\u201d He went on: \u201cMy experience is that there\u2019s always room for something out of the tried and true if it\u2019s sufficiently ambitious and engaging and original.\u201d", "Miller pointed to more than a few female historians who write for popular audiences, including Doris Kearns Goodwin, Stacy Schiff, Drew Gilpin Faust, Karen Armstrong, and Pauline Maier. Author Jean Strouse, who has written one biography each of a man and a woman (", "and", "), added Jill Lepore, Annette Gordon-Reed, Megan Marshall, Maya Jasanoff, Susan Pedersen, Sara Lipton, Linda Colley, Judith Thurman, Jennifer Homans, Patricia Limerick, and Mary Beth Norton to that list. Clare Alexander, a literary agent in the U.K. who represents historical authors and makes a point of representing women who write in the category, wrote in an email: \u201cIn the UK, while history in non-fiction definitely skews male and is largely published, edited, and reviewed by men, Hilary Mantel [the lauded author of", "] has been the harbinger of a renaissance of historical", "in the UK, much of which is also successful in America\u201d\u2014and is written by women.", "While a longitudinal analysis of trade history publishing might reveal a swing toward female authorship and diversity of subject matter, and anecdotal evidence points to some improvement, our data for 2015 still look grim. \u201cWe have a real problem in publishing, but it\u2019s not just a publishing problem,\u201d Heimert wrote. \u201cWhat is it about the way we educate our children that channels women toward literature departments and men toward history and politics departments? What are our assumptions\u2014and by \u2018our\u2019 I mean publishers, booksellers, book reviewers &c\u2014", "that lead us to publish history books for Father\u2019s Day and fiction and memoir for Mother\u2019s Day? Are these based on data or merely stereotypes?\u201d", "In order to determine which imprints tend to publish trade history books, we used Publishers Marketplace\u2019s database. We searched for imprints that had made acquisition deals in three categories: History/Politics/Current Affairs, Narrative Nonfiction, and Biography. The database lists top deal-makers in each subject category, with statistics broken down into two sublists: one ranking imprints by overall number of deals in a category in the past 12 months, and the other ranking imprints by number of six-figure-plus deals in that category since 2004. With our three subject categories, each broken down into two sublists, we had six lists of imprints that had transacted recent deals in a category or had invested significantly in that category in the past 11 years. We gathered the names of the Top 20 imprints listed in each of the six lists. Cross-referencing these results to eliminate duplicate entries, we produced a master list of 45 imprints that seemed likely to have published books in our categories of interest in 2015.", "Because many university presses publish trade books through deals that aren\u2019t brokered with agents, and thus would not show up in the Publishers Marketplace database, we also secured a list of presses that exhibited at the Organization of American Historians\u2019 most recent annual meeting, using that list as a baseline to determine a pool of university presses that publish in history and might have been likely to have put out trade books in the past year. Some of these presses had already turned up through our Publishers Marketplace research, but we added the names of 35 additional university presses to our list.", "With a master list of 2015 catalogs for 80 imprints in hand, we began to search these for titles.", "intern", "went through the trade imprint catalogs, and Rebecca Onion handled the university press catalogs.

The historical content of these university press titles was usually clear.", "Claire faced the task of deciding which trade books should be counted as \u201chistory.\u201d Some edge cases gave us pause. Are memoirs historical? Are biographies of still-living figures? Are true-crime books, if they\u2019re about historical crimes? What about journalism about the recent past\u2014books about the Iraq war, for example? We decided that these matters should be decided on a title-by-title basis.

When a book had both male and female co-authors, we split the authorship proportionally. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see that some books are classified as, for instance, \u201cone-third female-authored.\u201d We tallied biography subjects in the same way, splitting the count in cases where there were multiple subjects.", "We now had 556 titles.
