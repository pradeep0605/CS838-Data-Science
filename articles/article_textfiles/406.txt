(Full disclosure: I love branding and have enjoyed both its practice and study for many years. There\u2019s just something majestic about the ability of humans to turn bullshit into money.)", "But there the book starts to diverge from the nologoesque. Banet-Weiser, a professor at USC, clearly came to this world of commerce with deep academic suspicion, but to her credit she left with\u2014well, not an appreciation, but a sort of hesitant, furrowed-brow empathy. There are worse things than living in the same world as Beyonc\u00e9 and Applebee\u2019s, and this book, in its attempt to describe the \u201ctransformation of culture of everyday living into brand culture,\u201d doesn\u2019t imagine otherwise.", "The book leads off with a somewhat perfunctory breakdown of the Dove \u201cReal Beauty\u201d campaign, in which perfectly attractive women who occasionally enjoyed cupcakes were encouraged by Dove Soap to stop thinking of themselves as hideous hag-beasts but rather to esteem themselves and, not coincidentally, to celebrate their unique and perhaps curved bodies by cleaning them with Dove. \u201cWhen Dove criticizes the beauty industry for damaging girls' self-esteem through a very visible, social activist campaign that is funded through the selling of beauty products,\u201d concludes Banet-Weiser, \u201cthe relationship between political (read: individual) empowerment and consumer culture is intricately, and often ambivalently, configured within the contours of the brand.\u201d By which she means: Dove wants a feminism that sells soap. \u201cAmbivalence\u201d here is", "a synonym for \u201chaving it both ways,\u201d but it\u2019s key to remember that \u201cboth ways\u201d is a fiction. The folks who want you to sell that soap also want you to feel great about your boobs, even if they\u2019re not", "boobs. That\u2019s noble and all, but it\u2019s happening because they want to get some soap on those boobs. And not just any soap.", "The Dove stuff has few surprises, but things pick up a bit when she gets to YouTube. YouTube may be a crap volcano, but its freedoms afford people\u2014her focus here is on girls\u2014the ability to play and explore and perform different identities. Okay. But she also points out, and this is an astute observation, that many of these videos are reactions to the larger branded culture: Girls dancing to \u201cSingle Ladies,\u201d for example, or discussing beauty products, or playing with Barbie dolls. \u201cThe almost inevitable presence of commercial brands as structuring narratives for YouTube videos,\u201d she writes, \u201cindicates that self-presentation does not imply simply", "narrative of the self, created within an endlessly open cultural script, but one that makes sense within a cultural and economic context of recognizable and predetermined texts and values.\u201d", "Photo courtesy Sarah Banet-Weiser.", "Meaning that all that empowerment and self-expression is happening within the larger context of big brands and big money. With ads layered on top. Living as they do inside of a world filled with commercial narratives, little girls work with what they\u2019ve got. As a result, concludes Banet-Weiser, \u201cThe contrast between an offline empowerment that is \u2018real\u2019 and an online empowerment that is \u2018fake\u2019 is ultimately beside the point.\u201d The same things that make the Internet so socially transformative\u2014its openness, its focus on entrepreneurship\u2014also \u201cprovide the logic for the girl\u2019s self-branding,\u201d situating them evermore into a \u201chegemonic gendered consumer culture.\u201d (As should be clear, this is an academic book. The words", "or", "appear more than 20 times. I counted.) Hegemony aside, this is a useful lens through which to view YouTube videos. What are the messages that are here? To what is this person (often, indeed, a young woman) reacting? What products are mentioned or displayed? Are these people engaging with and seeking some sort of power from those brands, or pushing back against them and demonstrating their control and authority? Do all the commenters seem to be racist child molesters? (yes).", "Banet-Weiser engages similarly with branded street artists (like Banksy), branded political activism (like breast-cancer ribbons), and religious branding (like \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d types). The goal of the author is to demonstrate that with brand culture ascendant, \u201crealms of culture and society once considered outside the official economy\u2014like politics\u2014are harnessed, reshaped, and made legible in economic terms.\u201d She does so, but if there\u2019s one big flaw to this book, it\u2019s that", "chooses its subjects too wisely. Ambivalence comes built-in with Banksy; he\u2019s made himself into a sort of fruit fly for capitalist experiments.", "Say there\u2019s a continuum from \u201ctraditional\u201d authentic culture (Baptists, banjo music) to \u201cbranded\u201d culture (Baby Gap, Britney), with Banksy puckishly dancing in the middle, Dove soap in one hand and a purity ring in the other. Like the maidens of YouTube, all of us exist somewhere along this continuum. We\u2019re called to the authentic at times, but other times we\u2019re beckoned to by the brands. And all this harkening is the source of our ambivalence.", "The subjects of the book tend, naturally, towards the branded side of things. Reading about Banksy and Shepard Fairey brought another street artist, Swoon, to mind. Swoon sells her art, sure, but where", ", and Shepard Fairey may brag over the number of times he\u2019s been arrested, Swoon builds and", "\u2014as \u201cauthentic\u201d an activity as one can imagine. And yet all of these people coexist; they are part of the same scene, and they must negotiate with themselves as to their own relationships with the authentic.", "I recently went out in search of a copywriter to write a big old-fashioned full-page ad for a big old company. But as far as I could tell no copywriter was to be found in all of New York City. Having once been a copywriter I was shocked; we used to be everywhere, like drunken pigeons, walking around Union Square despairing over an assignment to write 50 taglines for a line of baby guns. A friend who works in advertising", "assured me that a few copywriters still exist, lurking inside of agencies, but for the most part they\u2019ve been transformed, or died out. All of the small, young agencies where I was looking were now doing experienced-based branding. And on visiting I found that their offices had live dogs and old vinyl records and smelled like burning crayons; their employees seemed impossibly young, almost fetal. They do not buy space in magazines and then fill it with advertising but rather build parks or give out scarves at events or create interactive spaces that might appear briefly in a town. Theirs is the world of the pop-up ad\u2014not on a website but in real space, and not intrusive but inclusive. Or at least intrusively inclusive.", "Seeking to define the authentic, Banet-Weiser writes: \u201cWhat other explanations can be found if we look beyond the authentic versus the fake, the empowered consumer versus corporate dominance?\u201d Thinking about my search for a copywriter made me wonder if perhaps we\u2019re all looking at this stuff from the wrong angle.", "See, you might say that branding seeks to commodify authenticity, to use it to its own ends, to sell more soap\u2014and use authenticity also to frame our thoughts. But you might also say that authenticity", "is an artifact of power. So people in the branding industry use the tools at hand\u2014graphic design, large marketing budgets\u2014to get access to that power. If you were a big old brand in yonder days you could do two things: (1) Advertise to the public; and (2) Use public relations to get to the press. Your bases were covered.", "But now anyone can have an opinion in public, and any human being can pop up on a mailing list and tell 20,000 other people what it means to be real. If you\u2019re not part of that reality\u2014if your products contain gluten, or you occasionally use slave labor to pre-assemble your shelving units\u2014you\u2019re screwed. Which is why there are so many jobs for \u201csocial media managers\u201d nowadays and so few jobs doing things that aren\u2019t awful. You need to get out there because people, given half a chance, will get authentic on your ass. \u00a0One dork can blow half a year\u2019s PR budget with a viral tweet. Because authenticity.", "The issue is not just that we live in a branded world and crave the authentic, but that the nature of the \u201cauthentic\u201d has become as fluid and reactive as the world of advertising itself. The Authentocracy has the tools, especially but not exclusively with social media, to propose a counter-narrative in which the things they prefer are promoted, the things they despise rejected. Their reward for their efforts is authority, the authority to say what is real and what is not. The modern branding expert\u2019s efforts are spent in an endless attempt to anticipate, to route around, to please, and co-opt\u2014not the \u201cauthentic,\u201d which is just a concept after all, but to enlist the Authentocrats themselves. Of course an authentocrat co-opted loses all ability to claim authority; their secret powers fade with the first junket. On and on: This endless loop, this ceaseless, pathological battle, is the great endeavor of modern branding. Within that loop, as Banet-Weiser correctly discerns, is where we live now.", "---", "by Sarah Banet-Weiser. NYU Press.", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
