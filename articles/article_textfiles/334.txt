Happily, such a book has already been written: David Mitchell\u2019s 2006 coming-of-age novel", ".", "The perfect teenage book should feel like it\u2019s being passed around secretly, its message too raw and powerful for adults to understand. It should inspire highlighting and ponderous margin notes that embarrass you 20 years later.

There was a time when Salinger seemed far more modern than Fitzgerald and Hemingway, but to young readers circa 2012, there is no fundamental difference between Holden\u2019s New York and Gatsby\u2019s West Egg\u2014both are places of antiquated privilege and clarinet-heavy music.
