The retired Michigan high school teacher has produced a number of works about Wilder, starting when he was a teenager in the 1960s and wrote a series of pamphlets about the Ingalls and Wilder families, explaining \u201cwhat happened next\u201d to a host of real-life characters featured in the books. Anderson\u2019s first pamphlet, sold at Wilder historical sites across the Midwest, attracted the ire of Wilder\u2019s cantankerous daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, a prolific author later known as a \u201cmother\u201d of the Libertarian movement (along with Ayn Rand and Isabel Paterson). After her death, in 1968, scholars revealed that she had collaborated with her mother in the creation of the", "books.", "David Michael", "Anderson has edited", ", out this month, which he calls \u201cthe last significant project in her words.\u201d In addition to revealing more about the mother-daughter team\u2019s collaboration on the books, the letters explore Rose and Laura\u2019s shared passionate views on politics: They despised Missouri Sen. Harry Truman, Roosevelt, and the New Deal while celebrating liberty, freedom, and a radical commitment to self-sufficiency. I spoke with Anderson about the letters, Wilder\u2019s enduring legacy, and being threatened by your hero\u2019s daughter as a teenager.", "My parents got me to Mansfield, Missouri [where Wilder lived as an adult and wrote the Little House books]. At Mansfield, the curators wanted to build a museum next to the house, and they told me, \u201cPeople come here and they ask so many questions. All this material you\u2019ve dug up\u2014why don\u2019t you write a little pamphlet that we can sell to people for a dollar?\u201d So that was the first thing I ever wrote. I was about 16.", "Yes, she went over it, and at one point she got quite strident with me.\u00a0 She was so adamant, like a fanatic, that everything in those books was true and that nobody would suggest there was any fictionalizing done.

She wrote me a huge lecture\u2014\u201cIf you\u2019re going to write nonfiction, you have to go to the documents, you can\u2019t repeat hearsay, my mother\u2019s books were 100 percent fact and this kind of thing discredits her as a person and an author and makes her books much less than they really are.\u201d I don\u2019t understand why she was so defensive.", "This is a question that we\u2019ll never finally settle. There was a movement some years back, perhaps among librarians, to have the books shifted into the nonfiction category. Now that is preposterous, but Rose thought it was a good idea.", "The image was that of a nice old lady who lived on a farm who just decided that she\u2019d write some books about her childhood. I think most people believed that for quite a few years, and they accepted it, and made her into some kind of goddess, like Grandma Moses. Laura had to do some justifying of the whole question of authorship to make it comfortable to herself. But I don\u2019t understand how someone as intelligent as Rose. \u2026 Rose was a great prevaricator.", "The reason I liked that letter so much is that she told her mother: You\u2019re one of the few writers in this country that would turn down a collaboration with the great Rose Wilder Lane. I thought that was priceless and amusing.", "When Laura was pushed hard enough, she wasn\u2019t a nice little old lady\u2014she would nag and stand her ground. I think she thought,", ". That was where they had friction.", "Isn\u2019t that an old story now?\u00a0 When I read the letters back in the \u201980s, I didn\u2019t think they were shocking or terrible. This family, generation after generation, they survived by pooling their talents, and here\u2019s just another version of it.\u00a0 They were cooperating with each other to get the job done and make some money.", "These are great stories.\u00a0 Kinda funny that people who aquired their land through a preemption claim felt government didn't help them enough.

There are a lot of teaching moments that need to be brought out. When I first heard those books, we were raised on cowboys and Western movies and TV shows and our knowledge of Native Americans was so stereotypically awful\u2014wild people that rode around on horses and yelled and screamed and wore a feather in their hair. We probably swallowed all that stuff without a second thought.", "Rose inserted anti-government sentiment in quite a few of the books, wherever she could. It was a completely lost effort on third-grade kids. The Wilders\u2019 anger about the New Deal was more personal\u2014they really hated taxation, and they couldn\u2019t get help to farm their land or paint their house when they were older. Like big business, they felt that government was stealing labor away. And that annoyed them. And the third prong to it was that they could look back very smugly and somewhat self-righteously, and say, we did this all on our own.
