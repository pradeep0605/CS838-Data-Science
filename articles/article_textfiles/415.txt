{"Body": ["When did we all become amateur typography experts? Perhaps we should credit Steve Jobs, a calligraphy buff who built a bunch of cool typeface options into early Macs. By the time I got to college, any sophomore worth her salt had firm feelings about whether Palatino or Garamond looked better on her Classic II. And any professor worth her salt knew that a term paper printed in 12-point Courier was a desperate attempt to stretch eight thin pages to the required 10.", "is a frequent contributor to", ".

We chuckle at cruel, font-based humor: \"Comic Sans walks into a bar and the bartender says, 'We don't serve your type here.' \" We leap to correct those who naively say", "(No doubt I've already done it in this essay, and will do so again. Many apologies.)", "If you merely wish to be annoying at cocktail parties, Simon Garfield's 2011 book", "covers the Ikea incident, the Comic Sans saga, and lots of other fun waypoints in the history of typography. If, however, your aim\u2014like mine\u2014is to blow past jovial dorkery, level up, and ascend to a realm reserved for the truly insufferable pedant ... may I recommend a new coffee table hardback from Stephen Coles?", "offers granularity that would glaze the eyes of a normal, well-adjusted human. I couldn\u2019t get enough of it.", "Coles begins with a glossary, and with annotation. He identifies the discrete elements that form a character (or \"glyph\"): the aperture, terminal, ascender, ear, and so forth. He then classifies typeface groups using a mix of appearance and ancestry\u2014be they rooted in brush strokes, chisel engravings, fountain-pen scribbles, or something more machined and modern. He informs us that when sans-serif typefaces (with no little feet at the tops and bottoms of their letters) first appeared in the mid-1800s, they were labeled \"grotesque\" because they looked quite bizarre to unaccustomed eyes.", "From there, Coles launches into the meat of the book. Each two-page spread is an extremely detailed examination of a typeface. One hundred in all, from Adelle to Whitney. Large-scale images of letters are accompanied by little arrows and captions pointing out their distinctive features. A few paragraphs of commentary reveal Coles' thoughts about each font's relative strengths and weaknesses, and ideal uses. Oh, let's go ahead and flip straight to some favorites.", "Illustration by", "You\u2019ll discover that Times New Roman was released in 1932 (credit for its design remains in dispute!), created for", "of London newspaper. We learn that its defining features include long, sharp serifs; very wide upper-case letters; and a comparatively small dot above its", ". Coles suggests it is a good choice for a \"conventional office-document look\" but that Le Monde Journal\u2014commissioned for the French newspaper", "in 1997\u2014is a \"fresher alternative.\"", "What about old friend Helvetica, Miss Typography of 1957 (and pretty much every year after)? Coles theorizes that its universality stems from the fact that its \"shapes and widths are unusually uniform.\" This homogeneity makes it perfect for big display logos but \"not as effective for long passages of text, where dynamic rhythm and unique lettershapes are vital.\"", "Keep leafing around. Garamond Premier \"has a formal personality that might not fit more casual topics.\" Baskerville Original has a \"debonair swagger.\" The cosmetics industry has long employed Optima's \"elegant serenity to label all manner of creams, ointments, and makeup.\"", "If you are presently staring at an open browser on a computer monitor, you are very likely reading these words in Verdana\u2014a font designed for Microsoft in 1994.

Be aware that this", "is double-story (sheltered beneath that little left-pointing awning) and not single-story (a simple circle with a vertical stroke adjacent to its right edge). Consider whether this monocular", "(with that left-pointing swoop beneath its main loop) would look better if it were instead binocular (with a second, smaller loop linking down below).", "Says Coles of Verdana:", "Its large, broad lowercase letters with slightly flaring terminals, its seriffed 'I,' 'J,' and 'j,' and its loose spacing can appear almost horsey when viewed large or in print. But this typeface was made for the screen. Every design decision makes Verdana the most legible small Text option for the coarse resolutions of all but the most modern displays.", "Riffs like this can be mildly bewildering as you first attempt to digest Coles' strongly voiced opinions. (\u201cAlmost horsey\u201d?) But as your knowledge accumulates, and your vocabulary grows, you, too, will begin to appraise these fonts with a critical eye. You will gaze at them alongside Coles, nodding at his insights.", "For me,", "provides a glorious opportunity to taxonimize another everyday visual encounter. I have long sorted starlings from sparrows, cirrostratuses from cumulonimbuses, Cortlands from Granny Smiths from Golden Deliciouses. And now, as I peruse the text of subway ads and pasted-up flyers, I delight in assessing their glyph widths, their stroke weights, their ascender heights. It\u2019s a total gas.
