{"Body": ["Illustration by Jess Fink", "When Richard Dawkins was named the world\u2019s \u201cTop Thinker\u201d in", ", it was hard to avoid the suspicion that the world\u2014or at least that part of it that votes in such polls\u2014must have an impoverished sense of what constitutes a vital or transformative intellectual figure. Any list of \u201cthinkers\u201d that doesn\u2019t feature one woman in its top 10 (Arundhati Roy opened the scoring for the gals at No. 15) probably shouldn\u2019t be taken completely seriously anyway, but the fact that it was the result of public voting does offer an insight into the kinds of ideas contemporary Anglo-American culture values most highly.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "The author of", "is not a particularly momentous or provocative figure in the sense that he\u2019s got much that is new or challenging to say about the world we live in. (Shorter Dawkins: Religion\u2019s for mugs; science rules.) But his popularity and prominence, along with that of the other New Atheism figureheads, illustrate the extent to which science, and the inflexible ideal of reason, has usurped the place of philosophy and the humanities in popular intellectual culture.", "One person who may well have been rolling his eyes pretty hard at the news of Dawkins\u2019 apotheosis as Capo di Tutti Public Intellectuals is Curtis White, whose new book", "is a series of targeted takedowns of key figures in this cultural hegemony of science. White is a nonbeliever, but like a lot of nonbelievers\u2014me included\u2014he\u2019s frustrated with the so-called New Atheism\u2019s refusal to engage with anything but the narrowest and most reductive understanding of religious experience, and its insistence on the scientific method as the only legitimate approach to truth. He starts out here by taking some well-aimed swipes at the Dawkins-Hitchens-Dennett Axis of Reason, but the book\u2019s interest isn\u2019t so much in the New Atheism per se as in the broader ideology of which it is the militant wing: scientism. Science often looks like the only show in town when it comes to considering things like the nature of consciousness and the meaning of human existence, and White is convinced that the demotion of the humanities\u2014of poetic, philosophical, and spiritual approaches to truth\u2014is a demotion of humanity itself. He\u2019s aggravated, in particular, by the mechanistic model of personhood advanced by neuroscience, whereby consciousness is seen as something that can be \u201cmapped,\u201d explained in terms of \u201cwiring\u201d and \u201cconnections,\u201d as though the mind were actually (as opposed to just metaphorically) a kind of computer. And so he\u2019s arguing for a return to the spirit of Romanticism, to an intellectual culture that looks to poets and philosophers and artists, rather than scientists, for insight into what used to be called \u201cthe human condition.\u201d", "As anyone who has read his previous book", "will know, White is a mad-as-hell merchant. His anger can be rhetorically persuasive, particularly when he\u2019s taking on sci-tech evangelists for ignoring the extent to which post-Enlightenment rationality has been responsible for at least as much human suffering as religion. \u201cIn spite of its obsession with Jews,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe horror of Nazism was not a religious nightmare; it was a nightmare of administrative efficiency.\u201d\u00a0But his indignation has a tendency to curdle into sour, ineffectual derision. It isn\u2019t that his targets aren\u2019t richly deserving of his wrath; it\u2019s that it\u2019s so often channeled into puzzlingly irrelevant ad hominem attacks and hastily constructed straw men.", "White has it in for the theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who insisted that \u201cthere is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made from atoms acting according to the laws of physics.\u201d But instead of seriously pursuing the troubling implications of this anti-humanist notion, he plunges us down the off-ramp and starts zipping along the low road at a ferocious clip: \u201cI hope you will agree that this is a very disappointing conclusion for someone who was almost as famous for playing the bongos and going to strip clubs as he was for physics.\u201d", "The next time Feynman appears, he\u2019s introduced as \u201cbongo man Feynman.\u201d", "Maybe I\u2019m missing something here, but it\u2019s not apparent to me how a person\u2019s enthusiasm for bongos and strip clubs has any bearing on whether his scientific ideas are worth taking seriously. This is about as clear a case as I\u2019ve ever encountered of playing the man rather than the ball. And it\u2019s frustrating not because you feel Feynman is being unfairly traduced but because this stuff is just not worth talking about in this context; it\u2019s a pointless diversion, and it erodes your faith in White as a navigator of the territory.", "A more serious problem is a tendency to oversimplify and caricature the views he\u2019s engaging with. White has a very strong case against Jonah Lehrer (whose ideas, he points out, remain standing even though his journalistic reputation has been toppled). The version of creativity that Lehrer sells in his book", "is, for White, a trite and desiccated thing, the business of mere dutiful neurons; worse, it collapses any distinction between Beethoven and some guy who invented a new type of mop. Creativity, in the view of Lehrer and other biz-phil savants, is a means toward an end; it\u2019s useful because it contributes to a \u201ccreative economy.\u201d But White chooses to demonstrate the extent to which this kind of thinking has infected the culture as a whole by presenting us with an imagined dialogue \u201cbetween an arts council board member and a \u2018difficult\u2019 person like me\u201d:", "\u201cOh! Art! We must save it!\u201d she says.", "\u201cReally? Why?\u201d I ask.", "\u201cWell! Because it\u2019s so beautiful, of course!\u201d", "\u201cCan you please stop talking with exclamation marks? You\u2019re as bad as a Tea-bagger going on about the federal deficit.\u201d", "\u201cSorry! If not because it\u2019s beautiful, then because our children ought to learn to be creative.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cBecause that\u2019s nice, don\u2019t you think? Are you trying to confuse me?\u201d", "If you have a bullshit detector, these \u201creasons\u201d should set it off, even if you also think, \u201cOh, let her say what she likes, the moron, since it\u2019s in my interest. ...\u201d", "The readings are pretty high on the old bullshit detector here all right, but not for the reasons White wants to suggest. There are surely more effective ways to discredit a real set of assumptions than having an imagined moron coolly interrogated by an imagined Curtis White. But he does this kind of thing again and again; the book is so filled with reductive imaginings of ideas that are already sufficiently weak in their actual form that the whole enterprise seems in danger of becoming a Million Straw Man March on the citadel of scientism.", "Courtesy of Melville House", "There\u2019s certainly a very real need to march on that citadel, because the idea that there can be only one kind of truth has to be deeply damaging to the intellectual development of a culture. You don\u2019t have to devalue empiricism to believe that there are kinds of understanding that can\u2019t be accessed in a controlled, peer-reviewed experiment. The problem, obviously, isn\u2019t science; it\u2019s the arrogance with which many scientists, and popularizers of science, dismiss the value of other ways of thinking about questions of meaning, about the world and our place in it. Lehrer, say, wants us to believe that, because neurologists can demonstrate how Observable Phenomenon X was happening in Part Y of Bob Dylan\u2019s brain when he wrote \u201cLike a Rolling Stone,\u201d science can therefore \u201cexplain\u201d the human capacity for creativity or imagination. This is like saying that the song itself is best appreciated by putting it on your stereo and then mapping the sound waves it creates. It doesn\u2019t really tell us anything useful, or usefully true. But this is the kind of truth in which scientism, and the culture that accommodates it, puts most stock.", "I\u2019ve spent a good portion of my adult life in the academic study of English literature and, for me, there is no more painful\u2014and painfully obvious\u2014proof of the intellectual hegemony of science than how the disciplines of the humanities have been forced to adopt a language of empiricism in order to talk about their own value. If you want to do a Ph.D. on, say, the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop, you will need to be able to talk about what you\u2019re doing as though it were a kind of science. What you\u2019re doing is \u201cresearch,\u201d and that research has to be pursued through the use of some or other \u201cmethodology.\u201d In order to get funding for that research, you\u2019ll need to establish how it will advance the existing body of knowledge on Bishop\u2019s poetry, and how it will \u201cimpact\u201d upon the wider public sphere. The study of the humanities, in other words, very often has to present itself as a kind of minor subsidiary of science.", "This is just one, fairly specific, form of the devaluation of the humanities in an efficiency economy. Scientism is essentially the belief, the faith, that all problems and questions are potentially soluble by empirical investigation (and that if they\u2019re not, they\u2019re somehow not real questions, not real problems). But there are large areas of human experience for which science has no convincing or compelling means of accounting. I am, I suppose, more or less an atheist, but when I read the Book of Genesis, I find that there is something profoundly true about the picture of human nature in those verses\u2014a picture of our perversity and self-alienation that neuroscience, for instance, has no way of getting at or talking about. Schopenhauer, Freud, and Heidegger all give us comparable forms of truth\u2014truths that aren\u2019t verifiable or measurable in the same way as those of science, but that are no less valuable. The most important truths are often untranslatable into the language of fact.", "---", "by Curtis White. Melville House.", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
