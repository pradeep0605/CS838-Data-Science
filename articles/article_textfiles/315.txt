{"Body": ["Illustration by Nate Powell", "I\u2019m pretty terrible with money. At this writing I have $170.40 to my name, which will be gone by the time you read this. I have a patchwork income derived from freelancing fees, a part-time teaching gig that ends next week, and a part-time consulting job. Taken together they\u2019re a little more than enough to cover my rent in New York City, except I already threw most of that money at past-due bills, so now I\u2019m a month and a half behind on rent. I pulled the plug on cable to cut costs but then wound up spending nearly twice as much at bars so I could watch baseball games. The one active credit card I possess is maxed out, and the rest of my debt hovers in the mid-to-high five figures. (I honestly couldn\u2019t even estimate it, because, well, I\u2019m", "with money.)", "Even when stably, gainfully employed, I\u2019ve lived in this miasma of financial fuckery for most of my adult life. A lot of us learn to just get by, because as embarrassing and uncomfortable as insolvency is to admit, it is a far more debilitating thing to confront. The challenge to make ends meet has nothing on the challenge to rewire a 37-year-old American brain to think sensibly about earning, spending, budgeting, and saving money.", "Which is where Clark Howard comes in.", "Howard, the syndicated radio and TV host, has spent the last 25 years dispensing money advice and consumer counsel to his growing legion of followers. His is a one-stop shop of investment tips, bargain deals, rip-off alerts, and seemingly endless hacks for maximizing every dollar you make. I\u2019ve listened to his radio show off and on for a few years now, and from the start, I admired his emphases on accountability and frugality. I liked to think of him as a demigod sent to save the middle class from its buy-now-pay-later self, just as long as they could A) get used to the nasal lilt of his voice and B) suck it up enough to put his insights to work for them. He was Moses parting the Red-Ink Sea.", "Obviously I never got around to sucking it up. Then I cracked open Howard\u2019s new book,", ". The thing looks as corny as it sounds: Its red, white and blue cover bustles with words (\u201cReal stories from Americans who saved, lost, and saved again!\" \"Consumer-Tested Ways to Overhaul Your Finances, Increase Your Savings, and Get Your Life Back on Track\u201d) while Howard grins zanily and gestures back to a line of happy men, women, and children rescued from stock-photo purgatory.

It cements Howard as a kind of economist folk hero\u2014a polo-shirted intellectual who can communicate more useful, constructive policy analysis in one chapter than Thomas Friedman gets across in a year of", "op-eds. He accomplishes this a number of ways, beginning with the raw elements of wealth and culminating in a grand theory of empowerment. \u201cI want you to take charge and take control,\u201d Howard writes in his introduction. \u201cOne dime at a time, one dollar at a time, and one day at a time. The end game is not to pinch a buck; it\u2019s to have the freedom to make choices \u2013 freedom to save, invest, and do as you wish.\u201d The word \u201causterity\u201d appears exactly zero times in", ", because in the Clark Howard system, there are no substitutes for rationality and deliberation.", "Along the way Howard (with co-authors Mark Meltzer and Theo Thimou) also reinforces his own unique role in the self-help cosmos\u2014that of a nerdy, wonky, omniscient foil to his more rock-star genre counterparts. Howard subtly acknowledges this distinction; \u201cI can\u2019t stress the importance of having the right money mentor in your life,\u201d he writes, meaning he can't stress it", ", I think. \u201cIt can be Dave Ramsey, Suze Orman, me, or any of a host of other financial gurus. Having the right guidance can make all the difference.\u201d", "", "So what makes Howard different? After all, he is rich like them (he retired at 31 after selling off a chain of travel agencies) and visible like them (his daily radio show is syndicated on more than 200 stations, and he hosts a nightly program on HLN). Like them, he renounces most debt, urges diverse investment tactics, and advises how to best stretch your dollar by staying informed and aware in the marketplace.", "Yet Howard evangelizes for something more: frugality as a lifestyle choice, and a comfortable, necessary one at that. \u201cToo many people who lived above their means before the recession found they couldn\u2019t weather the storm when it hit,\u201d he observes. \u201cIn the wake of the damage, it became very chic to talk about living within our means. Yet what we should have been talking about all along was living", "our means.\u201d Moreover, with his unflagging reverence for the underdog, he relies on a persona so unpretentious and even goofy that it serves to subtly mock his most celebrated peers\u2019 approaches. After all, Orman is the insider Oprah turns to when she needs a money column for her magazine. Ramsey is very smart and polished and Motivate-y in the grand Self-Help Author tradition.\u00a0(Let\u2019s not even get into fatuous bozos like Jim Cramer or Harry Dent.) Howard possesses the heavy hitters\u2019 confidence and economic expertise, but he packages and delivers it in a kind of normal-guy mode that feels like an easygoing neighbor offering consumer counsel over the backyard fence\u2014if you lived next door to an oracle, anyway. He is the kind of guy willing to go on the front cover of his masterpiece looking like he just farted in Suze Orman\u2019s car.", "isn\u2019t about monetizing Howard\u2019s dorky image, however\u2014low-hanging fruit for the Costco crowd. Instead, Howard hands his mission off to actual Americans who really", "live next door. He profiles a Pennsylvania man\u2019s efforts at self-sufficiency through green living, which also happens to save him thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. (\u201cI do not consider myself a \u2018greenie,\u2019 \u201d the man explains to Howard. \u201cI just believe in doing no harm and being responsible.\u201d) He cites a disabled, twice-divorced Indiana woman\u2019s propensity for dollar-store deal-hunting and online freebie-scavenging as a crucial lesson in fortitude. \u201cAll the advice, all the guidance \u2013 none of it will work for you if you just give up on life,\u201d Howard notes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to steel yourself when you face challenges like Darcy has done, and you\u2019ve got to do it in the kind and gracious way she has.\u201d He makes a potent argument for our presence in our own lives\u2014which, as anyone who ritually blows their money can attest, is all too easy to forget when you feel defined by the debts and dysfunction you carry everywhere you go.", "Courtesy of Penguin", "Howard and his co-authors thread this concept through dozens more profiles that feel like they could have been clipped from a midsized metro newspaper. \u201cMike Zaccardi was an 18-year-old high school senior when he heard me speak about one of my favorite financial tools, the Roth IRA,\u201d begins one story about a compulsive saver on his way to a multimillion-dollar retirement fund by the age of 50. \u201cAnd he really liked what he heard.\u201d Howard groups three or four of these case studies into chapters covering credit issues, cars, travel, investment, health care, energy, and a rollicking overview of consumer revolt. (\u201cNothing else has the same impact as a nice family picket outside a business,\u201d Howard claims.)", "", "He closes each section with an analysis of his subjects, how they can improve, and a selection of related resources for readers hungry to make a change. Looking for a wallet that will physically resist you opening it once you\u2019ve exceeded a certain spending threshold? Howard has it. Looking for a website that you can train to rebook a rental car reservation if the site finds a better deal? That\u2019s in there, too, along with scores of other online resources.", "If nothing else, the book is worthwhile as pure Americana\u2014a field guide of eccentrics in a jungle of money. I\u2019m sweet on the self-described skinflint who drives a 1983 Mercedes retrofitted to run on discarded fryer oil, but there\u2019s also the UC Berkeley dropout who launched his own T-shirt-printing startup and an enlightening interlude with the founders of eFuneral.com. There\u2019s a documentary filmmaker who combined his love of travel and a looming cardiological crisis to shop for a $9,000 heart bypass in Bangalore. There are the owners of a bed-and-breakfast comprising nine themed cabooses (and a pet tortoise). There\u2019s the inspiring tale of the young man who believes \u201cit\u2019s part of my duty as an American to have good credit,\u201d and there\u2019s the haunting portrait of a woman whose fear of banks and the stock market prompts her to hoard $100,000 in cash in her house.", "Perhaps not surprisingly, the more conventionally successful of Howard\u2019s subjects make for his book\u2019s least successful passages. On the one hand, sure: Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank has a good story of how he and his partners adjusted and wheedled and persevered through the rough early days of a little operation known as the Home Depot. On the other hand, Blank\u2019s billions are too much of an abstraction to do much good alongside the real lessons of Howard\u2019s flintier startups: We learn more about resiliency and entrepreneurship in 2012 from reading about Atlanta\u2019s ascendant king of artisanal ice-pops. The best of these anecdotes introduce folks with whom Howard doesn\u2019t even agree, like the man who has his $2 million life savings tied up in gold and silver. Fearing a bubble, Howard advises no more than 10 percent of savings go toward the current \u201cmania\u201d for precious metals; \u201cGuess I\u2019m really dumb or extremely brilliant,\u201d the man tells Howard.", "", "Of course, who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong isn\u2019t the point. The purpose of", "\u2014and of the phenomenon of Clark Howard himself\u2014is to spotlight interesting financial choices and deconstruct why they matter. You can always aim to save more than you spend, but ultimately, Howard\u2019s book says, we are all greater than our money. The real art is in choosing from a place of reason rather than denial, and then choosing reasonably again and again until the rewiring is complete. \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t get into debt overnight and you won\u2019t get out immediately, either,\u201d Howard writes. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to keep working your way out, day by day and piece by piece.\u201d And you know what? I\u2019m convinced. I may be pretty terrible with money, and my positive bank account balance may not survive this afternoon. I might even file for bankruptcy next week.
