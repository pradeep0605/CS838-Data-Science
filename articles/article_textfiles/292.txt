{"Body": ["Illustration by Emily Flake", "originally published in", "When", "was published in 1947, no one predicted it would become a classic. Its sales began to take off in 1953, and now the book has sold more than 14 million copies. I grew up with", "and I raised my daughters on it. The text remains bearable, charming, and even compelling after many, many readings. I wanted to find out why.", "When my children were still little, I went from reading", "at night to teaching Gertrude Stein to my college students in the morning. In the midst of talking with them about Stein\u2019s radical experiments, I was struck by how familiar they seemed. Instead of noticing Stein\u2019s break with tradition, I noticed how much her work had in common with the books I was reading at bedtime: a love of color, joy in ordinary objects, repetition with unexpected variation. This dovetailed with another observation: My students are not as puzzled by Stein as I expect them to be. Stein writes: \u201cGlazed Glitter. Nickel, what is nickel,\u201d and my students recognize the moment of wondering. This habit of wonder is familiar in part because we have been raised on the lists of", ".", "That similarity is no accident: Gertrude Stein was Margaret Wise Brown\u2019s favorite writer. Born into an affluent manufacturing family, Brown studied writing and early childhood education\u2014conventional pursuits for a young woman awaiting marriage\u2014but she became neither a teacher nor a wife and mother. Instead, she combined her love of modernism and education to become a pioneer in the emerging field of children\u2019s literature.", "Brown and Stein\u2019s sympathies both have their roots at Radcliffe College. Stein went to Radcliffe and studied with William James. One of her classmates there, a fellow student of James\u2019, was Lucy Sprague Mitchell. Where Stein took James\u2019 lessons to Paris, Mitchell took them to New York, where she applied them to the task of educating children, founding the Bank Street school of education. In 1935, Margaret Wise Brown entered the school, originally as a teacher in training, but, by 1937, she had become a writer.", "Born in 1910, Brown was the second of three children in a conventional, upper-middle-class family. Her nursery had a gas grate with decorative tiles depicting the three little bears and the cow jumping over the moon. The young Brown had a menagerie, including many rabbits. When one died, she skinned it, kept the fur, and announced that she was going to be a lady butcher when she grew up.", "Brown went to Hollins College, a women\u2019s college in Virginia, where she discovered Proust, Woolf, and Stein. After graduation, she moved to Greenwich Village and enrolled in a fiction workshop at Columbia University. That fall, she reread Woolf and Chaucer, listened to Gertrude Stein on the radio, and went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to hear Stein\u2019s lectures. That 1934 lecture tour followed the success of", "and marked the apex of Stein\u2019s fame.", "Gertrude Stein was Margaret Wise Brown\u2019s favorite writer.", "As Brown worked to begin her hoped-for writing career, she also drifted toward teaching. A friend encouraged her to apply to Bank Street, and there she found a community inspired by the relevance of modern ideas to early childhood education: welcoming immigrants and students of all faiths, emphasizing a pragmatic \u201chere and now\u201d curriculum that takes the child\u2019s experience and perspective as its foundation, and embracing the value of a hands-on acquaintance with science and the arts. Even so, Brown\u2019s start was rocky. Deeply interested in the individual child, she was indifferent to classroom management. One progress report notes that she \u201cseemed to contribute a somewhat disorganizing influence to the class.\u201d Most damningly, she left the art closet messy, \u201cwith two pots of glue spilled.\u201d", "While Brown struggled in the classroom, she excelled in Lucy Sprague Mitchell\u2019s language class. Mitchell recognized that a modern education called for new books. She also saw that she was not the person to write them. In keeping with Bank Street\u2019s emphasis on the here and now, Mitchell wanted children to read about the sights and sounds of their own world, unadorned with fantasy. She joked, in fact, that she was introducing the \u201cspinach school\u201d to children\u2019s literature. In Brown, she found the writer who could make her ideas palatable.", "Brown continued writing for both adults and children, but it was a children\u2019s story that made her a paid author. When her first royalty check came, she cashed it, hailed a horse-drawn flower cart, bought every flower on it, and called her friends over for a party. By the fall of 1937, Brown was meeting regularly with Mitchell and others, forming the Bank Street Writers Laboratory.", "Soon thereafter, she met the painter Clement Hurd, just back from studying with Fernand L\u00e9ger in Paris. On his return he and his friends had chartered a train car to Hartford, Connecticut, to see", "an opera by Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thompson with an all-black cast. United in admiration for Stein, and attracted to Hurd\u2019s paintings, Brown invited him to show his work at Bank Street. Hurd watched while the children looked at his art\u2014a process as terrifying as any studio critique. When the teacher congratulated him on holding the children\u2019s attention for five full minutes, his career as an illustrator of children\u2019s books began.", "At this time, Brown was also on staff at William Scott\u2019s new publishing house, W.R. Scott, working to develop children\u2019s books in keeping with the Bank Street philosophy. They invited contemporary writers, including Hemingway, Steinbeck, and Stein, to contribute manuscripts. Only Stein agreed, and the result was", ". Exciting as it was to have a reason to contact her hero, Stein\u2019s acceptance was clouded for Brown by the fact that, although she had drafted the correspondence, the male editors signed the letters. The two women never met. Moreover, Clement Hurd\u2019s illustrations notwithstanding,", "is not a good children\u2019s book. More than 60 pages long, it is too dense for a child to love or a parent to read aloud. Still, there are moments when one can see why people guessed Stein might be able to pull it off.", "Brown continued work at Bank Street, writing a paper on books for 5-year-olds. In it, she describes a child who \u201ccarries with him \u2026 the glamor of the two-year-old\u2019s own small self; the three-year-old\u2019s humor and love of pattern \u2026 and four-year-old\u2019s first playful flights into the humor of incongruous things \u2026 and, finally, the five-year-old\u2019s \u2026 careful watching of his own eyes and ears.\u201d We see, too, the strength of her conviction that writing for the very young could be great: \u201cHere is an audience sensitive to the sheer elements of the English language. \u2026 Translate their playfulness and serious use of the sheer elements of language into the terms and understandings of a five-year-old and you have as intelligent an audience in rhythm and sound as the maddest poet\u2019s heart could desire.\u201d", "Brown wrote", "as a celebration of the objects in a wonderful, enormous nursery, including some features of her own childhood nursery. She asked Hurd, back from World War II and looking for work, to illustrate it. In", ", objects are celebrated for themselves. The book\u2019s list is so perfect because it is so wholly from the child\u2019s perspective. Brown gestures toward an overwhelming feeling of smallness\u2014\u201cGoodnight stars/Goodnight air\u201d\u2014even the void\u2014\u201cGoodnight nobody\u201d\u2014but ultimately offers reassurance, in the final lines that cocoon our little sleeper in \u201cnoises everywhere.\u201d These noises, if not understood, are acknowledged. After all, misunderstood noises often keep us from sleep, and that final line seems to anticipate them, incorporating them into its lulling rhythm as if to reassure the youngest listener that the complaint she is about to make is unnecessary, that those noises are just another thing to placidly bid goodnight.", "In November 1950, Brown\u2019s longtime partner,", ", died. Shortly thereafter, Brown fell in love with James Stillman \u201cPebbles\u201d Rockefeller Jr., and they became engaged. She traveled to France, but fell ill. Recovering from a routine operation, she was ordered to remain in bed. Unbeknownst to anyone, a blood clot developed in her leg. Demonstrating to a friend that she felt fine, she did a can-can kick. The blood clot dislodged. She died instantly. She was 42.", "From 1953 onward, sales of", "grew, first steadily and then astonishingly. Brown left many, many unpublished manuscripts at her death; posthumous publications continue to this day. One of the first was", ". There Brown wrote:", "In writing for the very young, Margaret Wise Brown found the audience to delight in the imaginings of her mad poet\u2019s heart. And through her celebrations of the poetry of color, objects, rooms, Gertrude Stein\u2019s great imagination lives on, too.", "---", ".", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
