{"Body": ["Illustration by Peter Bagge", "Bruised past ripeness, all the action offstage, overwhelmed with beauty and always threatening to dissolve, Carl Phillips\u2019", "is an unlikely candidate for my favorite book of the year. Yet I doubt any new poetry collection has given me as much pleasure as this unusually\u2014generously\u2014slender, wintering tome.", "Part of that comes down to abundance: Phillips just writes so damned well, a rich ear interlocking his phenomenal powers of perception and imagination. Take for example the almost violent metonymy in the first words of the three-lined poem \u201cBrace of Antlers:\u201d \u201cAbbreviation for the animal\u2019s head.\u201d He observes gulls in a snow storm, \u201cthe wind in sudden gusts/ lifting their feathers,/ then the feathers finding again/ those positions that make flight, for a time, look/ possible.\u201d In another poem the moods and moments give way to each other with such terrible speed that the result, in spite of what he describes, is closer to awe than despair\u2014and closer to absolution than erasure:", "the grass and", "the imaginary conversation it makes", "with itself\u2026", "Or any man in tears, whispering", "Waves,", "then waves in reverse\u2014", "maybe that\u2019s all we\u2019re given.", "But damned good somehow never seems like enough to justify poetry\u2019s inbuilt isolation\u2014its typographic and temperamental incompletion. As that last excerpt\u2019s persistent entangling suggests, it\u2019s Phillips\u2019", "ability that makes his poems take root: his inability to ever pull free of the counterweight hanging on to his ideas, a kind of gravity that measures significance by the very strength of its resistance to anything he hopes to mean. Even as he argues in favor of investing in illusion, he seems compelled to do so with scrupulous honesty:", "As for the so-called waters of persuasion,", "why not cast what\u2019s left of belief", "upon them?", "As when we come to love a thing", "for no better reason than that we have found it,", "and find it wants for love. Have you ever", "done that?", "For Phillips, a classics scholar and the author of 11 collections of poems before this one,", "is a book of active ambivalence. It\u2019s a book, that is, of \u201cor\u201d\u2014a word that appears 38 times in", "\u2019s 35 very short poems. Looking out from the haunted aftermath of love (the death of a lover seems to lurk in the background, though it\u2019s never definitively named), Phillips struggles with the persistence of desire after the demise of belief. That desire frequently leads to \u201cfucking\u201d but only rarely summons thoughts of \u201clove,\u201d and those haunted", "s register his refusal to choose between things that cannot co-exist, that sometimes cannot exist at all, as in the concluding iambic sentences\u2014the latter an exact pentameter\u2014of \u201cSo the Mind Like a Gate Swings Open\u201d:", "", "I used to ask, but usually too late, and not", "meaning it anyway. He touches me, or I touch him, or don\u2019t.", "The haunting starts with the book\u2019s very first line, \u201cThere\u2019s a weed whose name I\u2019ve meant all summer,\u201d a sentence that manages to reach persuasively and tantalizingly beyond the brim of comprehension. (How do you mean a name?) But just past the line-break, the possibility of such meaning retracts: \u201cThere\u2019s a weed whose name I\u2019ve meant all summer / to find out.\u201d The richer, more elusive significance gives way to a simple declaration of complacency, and yet its prospect stays intact, as does the more general sense in this book of decommissioned meanings running alongside and against the life that remains.", "Phillip has a gift for making a sentence into a dramatic act, relentlessly unfolding some new and sometimes contradictory significance just beyond the next pause, so that the destructive offices of time and vulnerability also become a creative force:", "I know a man who routinely asks", "that I humiliate him. It\u2019s sex, and it isn\u2019t\u2014", "whatever. For him, it\u2019s a need, the way", "brutality can seem for so long a likely", "answer, that", "it becomes the answer\u2014", "a kindness, even, and I have always", "been kind, for which reason it goes", "against my nature to do what he says, but", "there\u2019s little in nature that won\u2019t, with", "enough training, change\u2026", "Those lines inaugurate one of the longest poems here, \u201cAnyone Who Had a Heart,\u201d which clocks in at 33 lines. It ends with them watching the horses in the man\u2019s stables after sex. Standing on the other side of so much harm, including the harm that has hardened into kindness in the lines above, Phillips concludes, \u201cLike broken kings, / they lower their heads, then raise them.\u201d", "As with so many of the moments in", "that final image of redemption exists only inside the terms of defeat. Many of Phillips\u2019 most beautiful phrases turn out, when you go back and look again, to be unreal; they bloom deep inside a complex syntax in which they\u2019re subordinate, already negated or merely a metaphor for something else. Many begin with \u201cthe way,\u201d a generalizing phrase that Phillips often follows with his most specific descriptions.", "Dinty W. Moore", "It\u2019s syntax as a model of survival. Set primarily in leaf-fall, ice and snow, these poems map a slow and peculiar resurrection: of the lover who lives on, rather than the dead lover who took an image of the speaker\u2019s body into the earth with him. (In the title poem, Phillips refers to him as \u201cthe dark that nothing, not even the light, displaces.\u201d) Phillips eventually chooses life\u2014and achieves significance\u2014but only by declining the richer significances that turned ghostly somewhere before the book began.", "Partway through the stunning \u201cMy Meadow, My Twilight,\u201d he writes:", "But to look up from the leaves, remember,", "is a choice also, as if up from the shame of it all,", "the promiscuity, the seeing-how-nothing-now-will-", "save-you, up to the wind-stripped branches shadow-", "signing the ground before you the way, lately, all", "the branches seem to, or you like to say they do,", "which is at least half of the way, isn\u2019t it, toward", "belief\u2014whatever, in the end, belief", "is\u2026", "The rest of the poem\u2014another 13 lines\u2014occupies a single sentence, too intricate to quote in less than full. Hovering over it all, the double \u201cmy\u201d of the title feels like an important concession. The providence, here, when there", "provision, is not so much in the world that Phillips describes as it is in the challenged art of description itself. Phillips\u2019 humility brings him to beauty. And his inability to account for his place among the living has allowed him to make the interplay between illusion and awareness into the one book this year that most richly and persuasively, at least for me, reinstates the possibility of finding meaning in a world that is forever ready to revoke the sources of meaning in our lives.", "---", "by Carl Phillips.
