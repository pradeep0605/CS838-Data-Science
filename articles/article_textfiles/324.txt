In the story \u201cMore Dark,\u201d a suicidal horror writer attends the reading of a colleague with a Salinger-esque pall of mystery about him. At the reading, Tom L\u2019s assistant, a \u201cvulpine\u201d blonde, sidles up to the narrator, while Tom L himself puts the reading audience into a trance.", "That Tom L and his entourage are actually creatures from another dimension bent on the subjugation of humankind won\u2019t come as a surprise if you\u2019ve read even one of Barron\u2019s past books. \u201cI can see that you\u2019ve seen,\u201d the woman whispers in the narrator\u2019s ear. \u201cInfinite dark, infinite cold, infinite sleep\u2026All you have to do is let go\u2026 Don\u2019t linger like HP and die of a tumor, last days spent wasting away on tins of cat food and the indifference of the universe. Don\u2019t end it foaming and raving in a ditch as dear Edgar did. Who\u2019d come to your grave with a flower and a glass of brandy every winter to mark your sad demise? You don\u2019t rate, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d", "", "That \u201cindifference of the universe,\u201d hastened along by the appetites of creatures like Tom L and his assistant, is the essence of the \u201ccosmic horror\u201d genre. In \u201cMore Dark,\u201d Barron cleverly recontextualizes it in the world of contemporary horror literature itself, complete with references to Readercon, World Horror Convention, and the two", "", "who started it all. It\u2019s an impish little metafiction that ends, with a wink, Barron\u2019s wild new collection. There, there, it consoles, we\u2019ll get eaten together. I am in it with you, too.", "In its original conception, the cosmic horror genre is as primal and ungimmicky as our fear of the dark beyond cracked closet doors. It\u2019s most often credited to Howard Phillips Lovecraft, though traces of its operatic pessimism appear well before him, most notably in the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, Ambrose Bierce, Algernon Blackwood, and Guy de Maupassant. Post-Lovecraft, the genre has undergone custom mutations in the work of Stephen King (", "and", "), Dan Simmons, Thomas Ligotti, Caitlin R. Kiernan, and many others.", "What finally emerges from cosmic horror\u2019s miasmic evolution over the course of the 20", "century is a literary concept that is equal parts genre and philosophy, cerebral and primordial. On the one hand, it entails deep contemplation of humanity\u2019s non-optimal place in the pecking order of the universe; on the other, its greatest tool is nothing more complicated than our fear of what\u2019s hidden\u2014the dark of the closet, or The Dark of the stars.", "And that\u2019s the trick of cosmic horror. It\u2019s horror without precedent, where anything can happen. In the ghost story mythos, whole centuries older, the spirit wants something\u2014redemption, revenge\u2014and the mortal players in the story must find out a way to provide it with this. The Ones Who Lurk in cosmic horror want only to dine on or squelch humankind; not if but when, and by what means, become the genre\u2019s chief pleasures. The prognosis, at last, is a grim and a cold one. With just one of Us and so many of Them, the odds are stacked in no one\u2019s favor.", "Enter the Alaskan-born Laird Barron, author of two novels and two previous story collections, who is equally concerned with mucusy gross-out and cosmic doom as he is with language, formal experimentation, and, above all, character. Relentlessly readable, highly atmospheric, sharply and often arrestingly written\u2014Barron\u2019s prose style resembles, by turns, a high-flown Jim Thompson mixed with a pulp Barry Hannah\u2014and situated in a dizzying assortment of precision-built worlds, Barron\u2019s productions (30 pages on average) more nearly resemble novellas than tales.", "Take, for example, the new collection\u2019s high-octane opener, \u201cBlackwood\u2019s Baby,\u201d in which big-game hunter Luke Honey travels from a languishing outpost in Africa to the Olympic Peninsula of Washington to join up with a band of debauched imperialists and blue bloods hunting the \u201cBaby\u201d of the story\u2019s title, aka \u201cthe black stag of the woods,\u201d aka ... you\u2019ll have to read to find out what. But whatever", "the hunters are hunting out there is not, altogether, the point of the story, so much as the sad evolution of Honey, who suffers from nightmares unnamable here, and the historically pithy and sharp-tongued dynamic that Barron enacts among the hunters.", "Courtesy of Laird Barron", "\u201cBlackwood\u2019s Baby\u201d finds good company in two of the collection\u2019s other standout historical narratives\u2014 \u201cHand of Glory,\u201d in which a jive-talking 1920s thug-for-hire goes to avenge his father\u2019s murder at the hands of a dark wizard. And then there\u2019s \u201cThe Men from Porlock,\u201d a flesh-ripper of a Western set in that same gap between the wars, in which Miller, a World War I veteran with stoic, invulnerable shades of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Kid from", "goes on another hunting expedition that takes him and his company through a half-abandoned town under the sway of unspeakable entities.", "But all of this", "sound parodically macho. And the men in these stories drink, and swear, and smoke, and shoot off their guns with abandon, the steady accretion of which might wear thin were it not for the existence of a different kind of story in", "that pointedly parts ways with these.", "Both \u201cThe Redfield Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Carrion Gods in Their Heaven\u201d revolve vertiginously around a cast of all-female principals\u2014in the former, \u201ca close-knit sorority of veteran teachers from Redfield Memorial Middle School in Olympia\u201d who rent a cabin on the edge of a lake that bears a spectral curse; and in the latter, Lorna and Miranda, two lesbian lovers on the lam from Lorna\u2019s abusive husband, Bruce, who shack up on a similarly benighted property in the upper woods of Washington (Barron\u2019s own Yoknapatawpha County). And where a lesbian relationship in the hands of a male horror writer might\u2019ve devolved into hot-oil rubdowns, Barron explores Lorna and Miranda\u2019s\u2014yes, even their sexual relationship\u2014with tenderness, and the mark of someone who wishes to write compassionately about all things. Not to mention the fact that, midway through, it turns into a werewolf story.", "Both stories throw into sharp relief what is most remarkable about Barron\u2019s innovation in the heretofore Lovecraft-dominated pool of \u201ccosmic horror\u201d fiction, much of which is by and about men.", "And, if it\u2019s not overtly racist in the way Lovecraft\u2019s work was\u2014he describes the earthly lieges of bat-winged cephalopod Cthulhu as \u201clow, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant\u201d\u2014is unconcerned with race entirely.", "But Barron\u2019s work signals the arrival of something warmer and altogether more human in a genre that, by its very nature, locates itself outside the scope of human experience.", "Barron tries on people\u2019s skins in the same way his creatures don mortal disguises, and in that act he does the work of championing human difference. It turns out that he\u2019s in the empathy business. He brings us dispatches not from the Beyond but juxtaposed with it, the here and the human.", "In 2009\u2019s \u201cStrappado,\u201d my favorite of Barron\u2019s previous stories, a pair of estranged, mixed-race gay lovers meet up in India, where they fall afoul of the sadistic machinations of a sinister artists collective. In \u201cThe Broadsword,\u201d septuagenarian bachelor Pershing Dennard is drawn inexorably into the web of hideous, extraterrestrial shape-shifters who take their gourmet in the form of we mortals.", "The creatures start to feel like foils for how we behave at our worst toward each other\u2014how when we see difference, it\u2019s never just that, but proboscises, bat wings, squid arms, teeth.
