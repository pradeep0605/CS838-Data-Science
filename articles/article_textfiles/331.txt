{"Body": ["Illustration by Dalton Rose", "On Sept. 17, six days and 12 years after the atrocity, we get from Thomas Pynchon a precious freak of a novel, glinting rich and strange, like a black pearl from an oyster unfathomable by any other diver into our eternal souls. If not here at the end of history, when? If not Pynchon, who? Reading", ", tearing up at the beauty of its sadness or the punches of its hilarity, you may realize it as the 9/11 novel you never knew you needed. Who else but Pynchon can indict the sins of power while giving the sinner noogies of love? Who else could", "invent, as the name for a Queens strip club, Joie de Beavre? Who you gonna call when a screaming comes across the sky?", "Troy Patterson is", "\u2019s writer at large and a contributing writer at the", "Pynchon\u2019s whacked-out magnum opus,", ", treated mass death and the immortality of the individual soul as the stuff of grand dirge and radioactive slapstick. Having accomplished such a novel along those lines\u2014a 760-page novel that is, moreover, only occasionally totally incomprehensible\u2014is clearly a prerequisite for writing a 9/11 detective caper that alternates earnest condemnation of the military-industrial complex with jokes about cops eating donuts. Writing this way about our home turf is Pynchon\u2019s home turf.", "feels a bit inevitable because from the first, in", ", Pynchon has been writing history as tragic farce. At the outset,", "\u2019s hero heads for New York with a Mediterranean barmaid whose vision of America is the bare-bones entry-level dream\u2014\u201cenough food, warm clothes, heat all the time, buildings all in one piece.\u201d In", ", the ravishing masterpiece, he mapped our country and our cosmos, as in a conceit supposing that surveying the territory closed off the sublimity of terra incognita, \u201cchanging all from subjunctive to declarative, reducing Possibilities to Simplicities that serve the ends of Governments,\u2014winning away from the realm of the Sacred, its Borderlands one by one, and assuming them unto the bare mortal World that is our home, and our Despair.\u201d", "is not so major a book as any of those three.

But it strikes me as a necessary novel and one that literary history has been waiting for, ever since it went to bed early on innocent Sept. 10 with a copy of", "and stayed up well past midnight reading Franzen into the wee hours of his novel\u2019s publication day. As I recall, literary history then slept in and woke to an alarmed answering machine exclaiming rare questions and soon was on the roof in Brooklyn, where people watched the \u201cterminal plume\u201d (as Pynchon calls it) from across the river\u2014\u201cfrom a place of safety they no longer believed in.\u201d This new book gives you more of that, with much broad comedy and fine nuance, plus beauty in the despair and also something called \u201cDESPAIR\u201d\u2014one of those patented har-de-har acronyms the novelist cannot even bother to pretend to try resisting\u2014the \u201cDisgruntled Employee Simulation Program for Audit Information and Review.\u201d", "We mingle with the disgruntled because the protagonist of", "is a private eye who sometimes turns her ears to whistle-blowers. And she also registers messages sent on esoteric ultrasonic frequencies. Maxine Tarnow\u2014immediately and adorably palpable in her needs and her chutzpah\u2014is a fraud investigator who operates out of her native Upper West Side. She has been the sole proprietor of Tail \u2018Em and Nail \u2018Em since losing her license as a Certified Fraud Examiner in connection with some conflict-of-interest run-ins. Living outside the law, she earns an honest living examining embezzlement, combining cynicism and idealism like any gumshoe in fedora and trenchcoat, and as the book begins in the spring of 2001, she\u2019s picking up a lot of business from Silicon Alley, a neighborhood littered with balance-sheet debris after the bursting of the Internet bubble. We\u2019re not sure of Maxine\u2019s exact age, but she is old enough to be the noodgy Jewish mother of two boys in early adolescence\u2014and old enough to know better than to dally romantically with the men that she has seen since splitting from hubby Horst Loeffler, a Lutheran from the Midwest \u201cemotional as a grain elevator.\u201d The first act introduces Maxine\u2019s Beretta, frequently packed not in a holster but her Kate Spade bag.", "The whistle motivating the plot alerts Maxine to suspicious goings-on at a computer-security firm called hashslingrz. (I should think that, invoking the laws of fiction, a prosecutor could indict the company\u2019s billionaire CEO on felony charges simply on the grounds of his archvillainous name, Gabriel Ice.) Working the phones and the legs, wiggling her antennae and her butt, Maxine discovers that hashslingrz has more limbs than a Hindu goddess of destruction\u2014fingers in plenteous virtual pies, hands in many an HTTP cookie jar, tentacles extending to disburse payments to phantom contractors, funnel money to mystery emirs via", ", play shell games with shell companies, scratch the backs of well-organized criminals, and exchange secret handshakes with clandestine Establishment operators. Maxine discovers rampant evidence of a crime that is arcane, insidious, and omnipresent. If pressed directly, Pynchon would describe Ice\u2019s systematic felony as a little something called \u201cthe global economy,\u201d a force against which the book keeps up a blue flame of ire. A cranky activist fumes that \u201clate capitalism is a pyramid racket on a global scale.\u201d A Russian gangster assesses", "on Game Boy as \u201cpost-late capitalism run amok.\u201d The narrator describes an \u201880s New York plagued by AIDS, crack, and \u201clet\u2019s not forget late fuckin capitalism.\u201d", "seems written in the belief that Osama Bin Laden was acting on behalf on the invisible dirty hands of the marketplace.", "Does Maxine get to the bottom of things? No\u2014there is no bottom, but as we track her sleuthing, we see many sides of the \u201cmeatspace\u201d (as opposed to cyberspace) that was Gotham, with its cozy greasy spoons and its existent middle class. Yes, Pynchon can be slightly dreary when going on about what Giuliani and Goldman Sachs did to New York. He can seem like another crank with a Zabar\u2019s bag when describing Times Square as \u201cDisney Hell,\u201d discussing the \u201cdiseased Hamptons fantasy\u201d of affluent leisure, and railing about the vapidity of the Upper East Side. Sophisticated people have made peace with these elements of New York, you think\u2014and then maybe wonder if that peaceful sophistication implicates them as part of the problem.", "His view of the tech world is captivating. Though he doesn\u2019t attempt any grand-scale Balzacian social analysis of Silicon Alley, he gives the full Fitzgerald swoon to passages describing the ritual sacrifice of innocence on the altar of IPO ambition and also to a dot-com party that unfolds on Saturday, Sept. 8.

Faces already under silent assault, as if by something ahead, some Y2K of the workweek that no one is quite imagining, the crowds drifting slowly out into the little legendary streets, the highs beginning to dissipate, out into the casting-off of veils before the luminosities of dawn, a sea of T-shirts nobody\u2019s reading, a clamor of messages nobody\u2019s getting, as if it\u2019s the true text history of nights in the Alley, outcries to be attended to and not be lost, the 3:00 am kozmo deliveries to code sessions and all-night shredding parties, the bedfellows who came and went, the bands in the clubs, the songs whose hooks still wait to ambush an idle hour, the day jobs with meetings about meetings and bosses without clue, the unreal strings of zeros, the business models changing one minute to the next, the start-up parties every night of the week and more on Thursdays than you could keep track of, which of these faces so claimed by the time, the epoch whose end they\u2019ve been celebrating all night\u2014which of them can see ahead, among the microclimates of binary, tracking earthwide everywhere through dark fiber and twisted pairs and nowadays wirelessly through spaces public and private, anywhere among cybersweatshop needles flashing and never still, in that unquiet vastly stitched and unstitched tapestry they have all at some time sat growing crippled in the service of\u2014to the shape of the day imminent, a procedure waiting execution, about to be revealed, a search result with no instructions on how to look for it?\u201d", "Courtesy 20th Century Fox", "Pynchon is grimly wacky with some details in his postgame analysis of that dot-com mania.

Back in Palo Alto, her husband and his business partner developed a utopian underworld of an app\u2014\u201ca virtual sanctuary to escape to from the many varieties of real-world discomfort\u201d\u2014called DeepArcher. It exists way down on the Web, beneath the attention of bots, as an adventure-game maze of unretraceable pathways descending infinitely.

Nothing and everything, and metaphysics that are handsomely coherent and readily legible, by Pynchonian standards. (I mean, the book is Out There, but that\u2019s where the Truth is.) The feeling of the space of the no-space of DeepArcher foreshadows the vibe Maxine picks up when tiptoeing through the cellar of Ice\u2019s Long Island hideaway (which may connect to a hush-hush government installation).
