She does", "twice in case you weren\u2019t paying attention. This rhetorical device will be familiar to anyone who has taken a college course in the humanities, or taught one: a little bit of filler with just enough idea in it to evade the red pen. And it\u2019s easy to see why Wampole makes such frequent recourse to etymologies: They project a comforting authority. They suggest that the writer is grounded in an older, less corrupt linguistic truth that has been recovered and presented to the modern reader. (By the way, did you know that", "means \u201cattempt\u201d?) While we take it for granted that our word usage shifts, slips, and changes according to the situation, we also tend to assume that at some hazy time in the past, words had solid, stable meanings, that they pointed to timeless truths about the human condition. In the contemporary world, the meanings of words have changed and are therefore, somehow, less true.", "This is something like what philosophers call \u201cthe genetic fallacy,\u201d or the claim that the truth of an idea is located in its origin rather than its present condition. While the essays in", "continually trumpet the novelty of their solutions to contemporary life in America, they remain, at their core, steadfastly committed to the genetic fallacy. Wampole, an assistant professor of French at Princeton, first came to the attention of the general public with her 2012", "opinion piece \u201c", ",\u201d which is revised, expanded, and retitled in", ". In the essay, she describes her own ironic modes of being (kitschy gifts, ironic shirts and coffee mugs, a love of plastic wrestling figures), diagnoses the culture at large as oversaturated by irony, and suggests a list of questions we might ask ourselves in order to close the distance between experiencing life and commenting on it. The last and, Wampole says, most important question: \u201cHow would it feel to change yourself quietly, offline, without public display, from within?\u201d\u00a0That this question, issued from within the", "\u2019 Opinionator blog, caused enough of an online furor to warrant", "(tags include \u201cOh Brooklyn\u201d and \u201cHipsters\u201d) suggests that irony might be with us yet.", "There\u2019s no pronoun that presumes more cultural authority than the general \u201cwe.\u201d", "It was the kind of exposure most academics secretly crave. And that question\u2014\u201cHow would it feel to change yourself quietly, offline, without public display, from within?\u201d\u2014contains the core of Wampole\u2019s concerns in", "that we live overtechnologized lives that are simultaneously too \u201clight\u201d and too \u201cheavy.\u201d Our lightness, which she calls \u201ca helpless ironization of everything,\u201d prevents us from attaching ourselves to others; our heaviness\u2014a \u201cdestructive kind of solemnity\u201d\u2014involves overcommitment to fundamentalisms, dogma, and ideological party lines. \u201cWe bob between two tendencies,\u201d she writes, \u201cthe lightness of paper irony or the heaviness of leaden politics.\u201d Wampole\u2019s solution to this tension, offered in the title essay, is to urge that we practice \u201cthe other serious,\u201d a kind of cool-headed, non-ideological attentiveness to the small joys of artistic creation and community. Most important is moderation and middle-seeking, a conscious avoidance of extremes, both in body and in mind.", "Wampole\u2019s style oscillates between the conversational and the austere, between chatty allusions to TV shows and mini-discourses on Diderot. She wanders through her subjects\u2014awkwardness, distraction, \u201cemotive spectacle\u201d\u2014like a dreamer lost in the forest on a pleasant day. She\u2019s happy to meditate on an interesting mushroom or to remark on a squirrel that crosses her path, but she\u2019s not too concerned about where she\u2019s headed or how she\u2019s getting back. \u201cOn Awkwardness\u201d meanders from the difficulty of translating the word", "to personal anecdote to philosophical rumination, swerves back to etymology, dips into some literary instances of awkwardness (Kundera, Calvino, and Emerson), and concludes that we, as a nation, have become more awkward than ever by \u201cbecoming increasingly alien to each other by virtue of the mediated existences we lead.\u201d", "Wampole frequently issues these kinds of collective diagnoses. \u201cWe\u201d do this, \u201cwe\u201d do that. On one hand, this is the kind of rhetorical conceit that many essays require in order to make their point. On the other hand, when the first-person plural is used in this way, it\u2019s easy to get the impression that the writer thinks we\u2019ve all got the same problems. There\u2019s no pronoun that presumes more cultural authority than the general \u201cwe.\u201d In using it so frequently, Wampole claims that authority without ever quite being clear on what makes her experiences so universal. She often tries to have it both ways, delivering personal anecdotes while claiming that they represent outsized cultural tendencies. The issue isn\u2019t whether or not we can locate the universal in the particular\u2014surely we sometimes can\u2014but whether Wampole\u2019s particular experiences, her claim to diagnose \u201cour\u201d problems, really are as universal as she thinks.", "Through the \u201cwe\u201d gesture, Wampole is laying claim to the role of public intellectual\u2014a time-honored role in the American cultural imagination, one that\u2019s traditionally been played by the stuffy, pipe-smoking old white guy. As with John Dewey, Lionel Trilling, William F. Buckley, or Allan Bloom, Walpole\u2019s combination of erudite reference, style, and institutional authority jells to indicate that Wampole has the perspective and the intellectual firepower to explain us to ourselves. She\u2019s a demystifier, an explainer of the \u201ctruth\u201d beneath the surface of things.", "One of the more admirable aspects of Wampole\u2019s aspirations to public-intellectual status is that she means her book to change the way people behave in specific ways. She urges us to abandon pose, immoderation, and digital media. She urges us to treasure the wisdom of the elderly and to gather \u2019round the campfire for a group singalong. Seriously. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything wrong with singalongs, but there is something galling about being told how we ought to live by someone who sees \u201cour\u201d problems as purely matters of mindset and attitude. She tells us that \u201cworking hard at music, art, or other expressive enterprises is one of the signatures of a worthwhile life,\u201d remorselessly hammering the point home by insisting, \u201cA thought that is never written down or acted upon might as well have never been thought.\u201d (So much for the quiet, contemplative life!) To those without the luxury of free time for artistic endeavors\u2014single mothers or members of the \u201cNew American Generation,\u201d as the book\u2019s subtitle calls us, in the midst of a continuing employment crisis\u2014she asks, \u201cWould it be so taxing to leave a pad of paper next to your desk and write down thoughts as they arrive?\u201d But surely that\u2019s a tough prospect when you\u2019re working the grill.", "Ultimately, the praise of calmness, middle-seeking, and moderation strikes a false note\u2014there\u2019s not a single acknowledgment of the hedonistic impulse in this book, and that is something \u201cwe\u201d ought to distrust. The new title of the irony essay, \u201cThe Great American Irony Binge,\u201d is telling.", "serves as a diet plan for the sensibilities, warning us off of the intoxicating effects of edgy opinions, experiences, and points of view. It doesn\u2019t deal with the central characteristic of hedonistic, overindulgent experiences, which is that oftentimes they feel", "good. What Wampole describes as \u201cmoderating\u201d often sounds like \u201cdeadening.\u201d She assumes that \u201ctechnology\u201d and \u201cmedia\u201d are always added to our lives rather than integrated into them in a meaningful way, but many people, like those separated from their loved ones by great distances and those who find true friendship through the Internet, might disagree. If Christy Wampole wants to be a public intellectual for the \u201cNew American Generation,\u201d she seems disconcertingly out of touch with it.", "---", "by Christy Wampole.
