{"Body": ["Courtesy of Knopf Books for Young Readers", "My", ",", ", has a new companion: an e-book, out this week, called", ". In 86 pages, it tells the story of", "from the point of view of the bad kid in the book\u2014the bully.", "The hero of", ", if you haven\u2019t had the pleasure yet, is August Pullman, a 10-year-old with a face that is startling and even scary to look at (the result of a chromosomal abnormality and an illness). He goes to regular school for the first time in fifth grade. It\u2019s tough going, for him and for the other kids, especially for Julian, who behaves atrociously toward Auggie. In", ", author Raquel Jaramillo (pen name R.J. Palacio) gives us Julian\u2019s backstory to explain his motivations. Better yet, she partly redeems him. I\u2019m so glad she decided to add this dimension of compassion to her story, which kids across the country are reading, in school and out. So I called her to discuss.", "Julian\u2019s perspective isn\u2019t included in", ", even though some chapters are narrated by characters other than Auggie. Why did you decide to write in Julian\u2019s voice now?", "I always had a backstory for Julian. But it was pretty negative, and I felt like it would have hijacked", ". It was too long, in proportion, to include in the book. But so many people really, really wanted to hear from Julian.", "Like me! And I think this e-book is the perfect format. Did you also set out to redeem him?", "I was researching", ", another companion book that will come out in August, and I came across one quote I loved so much: \u201cBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\u201d If you look at people that way, with a little compassion and tenderness, you come away with a better worldview. And always with little kids, there is something redeemable. I wanted us to understand what was motivating Julian\u2019s anger and hostility toward Auggie. And allow him the possibility of a little bit of an epiphany.", "You may be too modest to include this, but it was really after reading your book,", ", that I got into telling the bully\u2019s story. As you pointed out, so much of bullying is not as simple as painting one kid as the bad kid. It\u2019s so easy to go in and condemn, but it doesn\u2019t help.", "I won\u2019t be too modest to include that, even if I should be! We learn that one cause of Julian\u2019s bad behavior is fear. He had nightmares as a small child, after seeing movies with scary faces\u2014zombies, Voldemort in", ", Darth Sidious in", ". Auggie\u2019s physical appearance makes the bad dreams come back. Julian says, \u201cYou can\u2019t control it. When you\u2019re scared, you\u2019re scared.\u201d", "Yes, often we\u2019re mean to what we\u2019re afraid of. We\u2019re cruel to the thing we don\u2019t understand. Julian was afraid of Auggie, but he didn\u2019t know quite how to articulate it. He didn\u2019t get the help he needed. That\u2019s at the root of his hostility.", "Who\u2019s responsible, his parents or the school or both?", "His parents blame the school. I don\u2019t agree, because I think the school handles [Auggie\u2019s enrollment] in exactly the right way. I don\u2019t think the school needed [to send students and their families] advance warning. On the other hand, I can understand why the mother of a child who suffered night terrors might have appreciated that. You can see both views.", "I thought to myself: OK, Auggie makes Julian uncomfortable. But isn\u2019t that just life?", "Yes, but Julian\u2019s mom wants to protect her child. She wants him to have the easiest time possible in every situation. Who doesn\u2019t want that? But you don\u2019t do that at the cost of another child, ever. In wanting to make everything so lovely and beautiful and perfect for their kids, parents like Julian\u2019s mother really go too far.", "I read the first part of the book out loud to my kids last night, and they were completely and utterly appalled by Julian\u2019s mother. By the end, though, don\u2019t you redeem her just a little bit, too?", "I wanted her to have a moment of self-awareness. We don\u2019t quite know what motivates her. At the end, maybe she is tired and a little embarrassed. Or maybe she is truly sorry for the pain she and Julian caused Auggie. Or maybe she is just thinking about herself and son. Julian\u2019s mom is all about Julian.", "What about the other moms? There is a scene in which one of them starts to confront her but then backs down. And I thought:", ".\u201d I hear about it a lot when I go to talk at schools. It\u2019s hard for other parents to take on the mother or father who is defending the child who is acting like a bully or building a wall of social exclusion.", "One reason I wrote", "was to anonymously address how I wished other parents would behave. I think parents are so eager to see their kids not on the bottom of the totem pole, as they perceive things socially, that sometimes they\u2019re willing to turn a blind eye to whatever they think their kids need to do to", "be on the bottom. Sometimes that includes letting kids be a little meaner than they should be. There is such a fine line between meanness, social isolation, and bullying.", "Without giving away details, Julian\u2019s grandmother is an important new character who fills in his family history. Why did you bring her in?", "Julian wasn\u2019t getting the tough love he needed from his parents. Julian\u2019s grandmother is also very integral because her storyline really resonates with Julian. I always believe the best way to teach kids is by storytelling.", "You mean that stories get under their skin?", "Right. You can wave a finger at a kid and tell him how to behave, or you can show him how to be through a story. Julian couldn\u2019t do it on his own. He had to hear his grandmother in order to get to the place he can in fact go to. Which is true for kids\u2014they need guidance.
