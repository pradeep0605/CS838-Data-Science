{"Body": ["Tina Kugler", "Hey, I get why you\u2019d give a Dr. Seuss book as a graduation gift. It ticks all the boxes: nostalgia for childhood, lessons for the future, jubilance for the day itself. It hits the whole major chord of grace notes you want to hear on commencement day: wit, whimsy, wisdom, wistfulness. Seuss was a beloved grandfather figure, full of winks and jests for his young audience: He intertwines in one person the whole multigenerational rainbow you see in the folding chairs at a graduation ceremony. Best of all, when you give the gift of Seuss, you know the panicked job-hunting 18- or 22-year-old recipient might actually take the seven minutes required to read it. So yeah, I get why you\u2019d turn to old Theodore Geisel on graduation day.", "I just don\u2019t get why you\u2019d pick", "You could do worse, I suppose.", "is a peppy slideshow of panoramas, strung together by second-person narration reminiscent of a cloying self-help book.

Its relentless enthusiasm\u2014from the triumphalist title to the frenzied cry of \u201cKID, YOU\u2019LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!\u201d\u2014is so far over the top that it threatens to be the one thing Seuss never was: inauthentic.", "Where, I ask, are the myriad other qualities of Seuss\u2019 genius?", "Where is the absurdist wordplay of", "the wistful insight of", "Where is the deep moralism of", ", the unflinching darkness of", ", the mournful poignancy of", "?
