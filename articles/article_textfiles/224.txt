{"Body": ["Photo by Jyoti Kingsnorth", "Early in", ", Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s widely and rightly praised novel of the Norman conquest, the narrator laments his losses. Once a privileged English landowner, Buccmaster has seen the French invaders destroy all that he owns and all that he loves. \u201cWords are the only weapons I have left now, and no one would say I have ever been afraid to wield the weapons I have,\u201d he declares.", "Except that\u2019s not what he says, not quite. Instead, Kingsnorth writes:", "words now is left my only waepens and non wolde sae i has efer been afeart to wield what waepens i has.", "Every word in the book\u2014dialogue and narration alike\u2014is written in this style, an internally consistent invented language that approximates Old English. Learning to make sense of it\u2014to read as Buccmaster speaks\u2014becomes a complex dance of empathy. On the one hand, the more comfortable we get with it, the better we get to know Buccmaster. On the other, its persistent strangeness is an ongoing reminder of his distance from us, and of the alienness of his world.", "No mere gimmick, Kingsnorth\u2019s archaisms encode his characters\u2019 most dearly held beliefs.", "\u2019s vocabulary is almost exclusively Germanic, and with good reason. A true Englishman (he would call himself \u201ctriewe anglisc\u201d), Buccmaster refuses even to acknowledge the francophone impositions that later shaped Middle and modern English. His is the language of those who came before William the Conqueror ripped the land apart and stitched it together again. Speaking as he does becomes a way of pushing back against this invader and those who bowed before him. Though he sometimes brandishes his grandfather\u2019s sword, words really are Buccmaster\u2019s only weapons in his guerrilla campaign, because his insurgency is more linguistic than it is physical.", "If Buccmaster\u2019s language conveys his loathing for", "(foreigners), it also underscores his losses, in part through its limitations. That this book is readable at all is largely a consequence of its finite lexicon. Because Kingsnorth declines Latinate roots wherever possible, Buccmaster lives in a state of linguistic deprivation, every available word obliged to do the work of many. Take", ", which Buccmaster uses to mean \u201cgone,\u201d \u201clost,\u201d \u201cwent,\u201d and \u201cdeparted,\u201d sometimes in close proximity to one another: \u201call gan all was gan and so i gan i toc what i had and i gan away from my hus and land.\u201d With each repetition, the word reaffirms the enormity of Buccmaster\u2019s sorrows. To render this passage in conventional English would be to silence its expressive rhythm, capturing the meaning, but losing the feeling.", "Truly understanding", "therefore entails taking on Buccmaster\u2019s suffering, paring down the rich variety of your own language as you watch the French strip everything from him. Understanding him and empathizing with him are one and the same, a coin\u2019s face and its obverse. It took me just about 50 pages to get a feel for it\u201450 pages before his syntax settled into my bones, before his voice came through clearly, before his heartbreak was mine. Though different readers will experience the book in different ways, I suspect I\u2019m not alone in reaching that 50-page milestone. If you\u2019re not at ease by this point, you\u2019re unlikely to keep reading.", "The trouble is that Buccmaster may not be worthy of the empathy we develop. Just as the book approaches that crucial 50-page mark, the increasingly familiar Buccmaster does something unforgivable. Angry that his sons have been recruited for a", "(conscript army) while he has been passed over, he lashes out at his beloved wife, Odelyn. As he repeatedly strikes her, she falls, hitting her head on a heavy stone, \u201cand she is on the flor hwinan lic a cat in a water pael all blud and spit.\u201d This is a violent book, but few of its images are more shocking than this one of Odelyn, bleeding, sobbing, and prone.", "It\u2019s no accident, I think, that Kingsnorth confronts us with this image at the very moment when his novel begins to seem most accessible. Finally pushing through the book\u2019s stylistic difficulty, we find ourselves mired in the fen of", "difficulty. It\u2019s simple enough by this point to understand", "Buccmaster does what he does. He\u2019s desperate to regain control of his limited domain, a need that prefigures his every action in the pages that follow. Despite that, we\u2019re repulsed by the violence of the act, and troubled by a sexual politics so far from our own. Now that his language pulls us in, the things he describes make us want to pull away.", "Historical fictions often entice with the very things they invite us to critique. In", ", especially its early seasons, bad behavior delights: Don Draper loses some of his charm when he stops smoking quite so much, refrains from cheating quite so often. To some extent, this narrative sleight of hand is possible because such stories don\u2019t make their elsewhens strange enough. In an explanatory note that he appends to", ", Kingsnorth argues that the problem is partially linguistic. Claiming that he doesn\u2019t \u201cget on with historical novels written in contemporary language,\u201d he writes, \u201cOur assumptions, our politics, our worldview, our attitudes\u2014all are implicit in our words, and what we do with them.\u201d Forcing us to learn a new way of reading, he slowly makes the other familiar without sacrificing its otherness. And in doing so he leaves us open to still starker forms of alienation.", "\u2019s triumph, then, is also its greatest challenge, the cultivation of an uneasy empathy.", "We\u2019re not quite meant to enjoy its 11", "-century England. While Kingsnorth renders a time and place worth exploring, we\u2019d never want to live there, even under the best of circumstances. Buccmaster, likewise, isn\u2019t some appealing antihero.
