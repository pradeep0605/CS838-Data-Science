The timeliness is grim, but a book like this will always be timely\u2014not merely because its concerns are shamefully perennial, but because it is a work of rare beauty and revelatory honesty.", "unfolds as a six-chapter letter from Coates to his 15-year-old son Samori, prompted by his son\u2019s stunned and heartbroken reaction to last November\u2019s announcement that no charges would be brought against Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. The framing device is an explicit homage to James Baldwin\u2019s", ", a similarly compact volume published in 1963 that begins with a prefatory essay titled \u201cMy Dungeon Shook: Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation.\u201d", "is a love letter written in a moral emergency.", "Baldwin\u2019s \u201cLetter\u201d runs just a few pages and is a work of ferocious urgency, words of anguished wisdom imparted from an elder (\u201cI have begun this letter five times and torn it up five times,\u201d he writes in the opening line).", "in contrast, is not so much a work of counsel as a lovingly, painstakingly crafted inheritance, a reflection on fatherhood that often feels like a spiritual sequel to Coates\u2019 first book,", ", a memoir of his childhood in Baltimore that focused heavily on his own father. If", "was Coates explaining his father to himself,", "is Coates explaining himself to his son, and, in doing so, explaining as best he can what it means to be black in America.", "Much of this happens through snapshots of Coates\u2019 life, both prior to fatherhood and during it. Some of these moments are immense and tragic, such as", "at the hands of police, an event that, Coates writes, \u201ctook me from fear to a rage that burned in me then, animates me now, and will likely leave me on fire for the rest of my days.\u201d Others are more quotidian if still wrenching, such as a brief and heated confrontation with a middle-aged white woman who shoves a 4-year-old Samori at a movie theater. Still others are warm and joyful: every description of Samori\u2019s mother, for instance, or a fantastic meal shared with a new friend on Coates\u2019 first trip to Paris.", "Enroll now in a different kind of summer school.

And yet", "is not really a book about Samori Coates, or even Ta-Nehisi Coates, but rather everything around them, the \u201cworld\u201d of the book\u2019s title. \u201cBlack people love their children with a kind of obsession,\u201d writes Coates to his son. \u201cYou are all we have, and you come to us endangered. I think we would like to kill you ourselves before seeing you killed by the streets that America made.\u201d", "is a love letter written in a moral emergency, one that Coates exposes with the precision of an autopsy and the force of an exorcism. Taken as a whole the book is Coates\u2019 attempt to sever America\u2019s ongoing romance with its own unexamined platitudes of innocence and equality, a romance that, in the writer\u2019s telling, \u201cpersists by warring with the known world.\u201d In", "this collective delusion is known as \u201cThe Dream.\u201d The Dream, writes Coates, \u201cis perfect houses with nice lawns. \u2026 The Dream smells like peppermint but tastes like strawberry shortcake. And for so long I have wanted to escape into the Dream, to fold my country over my head like a blanket. But this has never been an option because the Dream rests on our backs, the bedding made from our bodies.\u201d The Dream is wrought from a legacy of white supremacy so entrenched it nearly conceals itself, and Coates\u2019 book is a call to awakening. As such, it joins a tradition that stretches back at least as far as Frederick Douglass and runs up through Barack Obama\u2019s Charleston eulogy just two weeks ago. The richness of this tradition is a formidable thing, and its duration and continuing urgency do not speak well of this country.", "Coates is frequently lauded as one of America\u2019s most important writers on the subject of race today, but this in fact undersells him: Coates is one of America\u2019s most important writers on the subject of America today. This distinction might sound glib but is worth making, not least of all because Coates repeatedly informs us that he isn\u2019t much interested in \u201crace\u201d as a subject of reflection in itself. \u201cRace is the child of racism, not the father,\u201d he writes\u2014while race is a fiction of power, racism is power itself, and very real.", "It\u2019s also worth making this distinction because for many white Americans the word", "simply translates to", ", an invitation to defensive disavowal and aggrievement. Consider the amount of times that Barack Obama has been accused of \u201cinjecting race into the conversation\u201d or \u201cplaying the race card\u201d simply by making reference to his own body, as he did in the aftermath of the killing of Trayvon Martin. Or the inability of politicians and talk show hosts to describe the actions of Dylann Roof for what they were, a terrorist act committed on the imagined behalf of people who look like him. Or the way a statement like \u201cblack lives matter\u201d becomes shouted over with \u201call lives matter,\u201d a mass of people feeling insufficiently loved by people they fear.

White Americans may need to read this book more urgently and carefully than anyone, and their own sons and daughters need to read it as well. This is not to say this is a book about white people, but rather that it is a terrible mistake for anyone to assume that this is just a book about nonwhite people. In the broadest terms", "is about the cautious, tortured, but finally optimistic belief that something beyond these categories persists. Implicit in this book\u2019s existence is a conviction that people are fundamentally reachable, perhaps not all of them but enough, that recognition and empathy are within grasp, that words and language are capable of changing people, even if\u2014especially if\u2014those words are not ones people prefer to hear. Coates has written a book about immense and ongoing failures of humanity that is a triumph of humanism in itself, a book that renders the injuries of racism brutally near and real.", "Photo by Nina Subin", "The \u201copen letter\u201d is the most overused mode of contemporary writing, a one-sided conversation with someone famous in which the performative bypass of audience creates an aloof sort of anti-intimacy. The open letter form of", "on the other hand,", "is entirely in the service of intimacy, a window into parental love, the first and most fundamental intimacy all of us encounter. Throughout the book Coates employs similar concepts so primal as to be indisputable. Among the most powerful of these is the human body, which Coates mentions relentlessly. He invokes the body as the fundamental unit of human existence and also explores the ways that white and nonwhite bodies have functioned in the building of America. This starts with the book\u2019s opening sentence: \u201cLast Sunday the host of a popular news show asked me what it meant to lose my body,\u201d as Coates recalls a TV anchor\u2019s skepticism to his claim that America was \u201cbuilt on looting and violence.\u201d As a descendant of slaves, Coates\u2019 sheer presence on her show would seem to be evidence of this. Recounting his adolescence, Coates describes his awareness that \u201cNot being violent enough could cost me my body. Being too violent could cost me my body.\u201d Still later he writes of our \u201csprawling prison system, which has turned the warehousing of black bodies into a jobs program for Dreamers and lucrative investment for Dreamers.\u201d \u201cBlack life is cheap,\u201d Coates grimly observes, \u201cbut in America black bodies are a natural resource of incomparable value.\u201d Throughout his book Coates writes about the theft of physical bodies, from slavery up through the prison-industrial complex, and of bodily agency itself, the lack of safety perversely wrought by constant surveillance, when those sworn to protect you imagine themselves as protecting other people from you.", "Time functions similarly. At one point, reminiscing on his son\u2019s toddlerhood, Coates ruminates on the longstanding parenting adage that black children must be \u201ctwice as good to get half as much.\u201d \u201cIt seemed to me that our own rules redoubled plunder,\u201d writes Coates.", "This is a beautiful passage whose beauty works in service of its political heft, and vice versa, as images of romance are converted into objects of loss and siege. To be white and live in the Dream is to live in blissful absence of these fears, and yet Coates\u2019 aim isn\u2019t simply to unsettle this absence, but to force his readership into confrontation with presence, with empathy for those whom the Dream denies.", "isn\u2019t a perfect book, and given Coates\u2019 prominence and a general tendency in contemporary culture to take shots at whoever\u2019s reaping acclaim at a given moment, there will surely be critiques, and some will have merit. For starters, while Coates has been quick to credit feminist theory with inspiring his interest in the body, this is an inescapably male-centric text\u2014let\u2019s hope we might soon see a book of similar profile and prestige published with an eye toward daughters (or even nieces;", "isn\u2019t passing any Bechdel Tests either). Furthermore, given the extent to which the menaces of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and \u201cIslamic terrorists\u201d have been used to stoke the fires of white fear in the 21", "-century U.S., Coates\u2019 analysis of the contemporary American racial imagination may strike some as overly black-and-white.", "But", "isn\u2019t a work of scholarship, or theory, or journalism, even if it bears the influence of all these things in the way great nonfiction should.", "The book", "will certainly continue the comparisons between Coates and Baldwin, but the differences between the two are instructive as well.", "is a fiercely present-minded book that prefigures what would come to be known as the New Journalism: references to contemporary politics abound, and Baldwin\u2019s meeting with Elijah Muhammad is recounted in vivid, reportorial detail. History is largely left in the background, and there\u2019s little mention of other writers, living or dead. By its end", "the book is basically a sermon, as the title suggests, Baldwin\u2019s voice exquisite and thunderous, equal parts preacher and angry god.", "Coates doesn\u2019t really write like this (no one does). Coates is more teacher than preacher, a polymath whose breadth of knowledge on matters ranging from literature to pop culture to French philosophy to the Civil War bleeds through every page of his book, distilled into profound moments of discovery, immensely erudite but never showy. In this respect", "bears the mark of a more recent literary elder, Toni Morrison, whose slim volume", "is one of the most brilliant explorations of racial thought and American writing ever published. (For what it\u2019s worth Morrison contributes a blurb to", "in which she, too, likens Coates to Baldwin.) Morrison is of course a renowned teacher herself, and as any high school or college literature instructor will tell you, few books on Earth teach as well as hers.", "I found myself thinking a lot about teaching and teachers while reading", ", and not just because I\u2019m one myself, at a university founded by one of America\u2019s most famous slaveholders. I first read", "as a junior in high school; it was pushed on me by an eccentric but thrilling English teacher who told me that it was the greatest essay ever written. I still remember him vividly, because he was the kind of teacher who made me read books like that and who talked about writing in that way. He died a number of years ago, but I wish I could give Coates\u2019 book to him.
