There\u2019s a misconception that we\u2019re living in a time of over-sharing; in fact, it\u2019s more accurately a time of managed sharing, of shaping our shares to either avoid conflict or instigate it. From filtered selfies to blogged polemics designed to dominate", "of any given day, there\u2019s maybe never been more manufacturing of confessional impulse. It\u2019s become incredibly difficult for anyone, public figure or not, to speak their truth without pre-calculating how much shit they\u2019re willing to take for it, and calibrating their message accordingly. If you are like me, maybe you\u2019ve acknowledged to yourself or your friends that this climate is compelling you to self-censor in a variety of different ways, but I think Minaj is the first artist that I\u2019ve seen publicly acknowledge that even her self-consciously \u201cpersonal\u201d album was hedged by these concerns.", "The humans of", "are all wandering around in astronaut helmets full of swirling private language.", "This is the world in which July\u2014the artist/author/performer perhaps best known as writer/director/actress of two films,", "and", "\u2014has released her debut novel.", "is a brave undertaking for July, and not just because it finds her committing to long-form storytelling without a visual element for the first time. It incorporates a boldly feminist recasting of familiar tropes and genres, without worrying itself over empowerment at the expense of emotional honesty. But it\u2019s also about weakness, self-delusion, and fear, and without really concerning itself too directly with the topic of the Internet or pop culture on the whole, its area of inquiry isn\u2019t far off from Minaj\u2019s", "admission.", "It\u2019s the story of Cheryl, an aggressively polite fortysomething who is entering her third decade in employ at Open Palm, an organization which was once a nonprofit promoting self-defense education for women, and which now produces lucrative exercise videos utilizing the jab-and-kick building blocks of their previous Model Mugging-style simulations. The videos, Cheryl is quick and proud to note, were her idea, but instead of heralding Cheryl\u2019s contributions, the staff and bosses at Open Palm treat her as an overly solicitous doormat\u2014a role she accepts, fittingly, without protest.", "Cheryl is well aware that she\u2019s become virtually a nonentity\u2014she even celebrates it. In her first-person narration, she describes a housekeeping \u201csystem\u201d she\u2019s created so that, by using things like dishes and books at an absolute minimum, she doesn\u2019t really ever have to clean. When the system\u2019s working, Cheryl explains, \u201cmy days become dreamlike, no edges anywhere, none of the snags and snafus that life is famous for. After days and days alone it gets silky to the point where I can\u2019t even feel myself anymore, it\u2019s as if I don\u2019t exist.\u201d", "And then, under duress, which she dutifully swallows, Cheryl agrees to open up her home to Clee, the 21-year-old daughter of the founders of Open Palm. Clee is a whirling dervish of callow youth who upends Cheryl\u2019s home, and kicks her fantasy life into heretofore-unknown high gears. Clee\u2019s host becomes preoccupied with the aspects of Clee which make Cheryl feel uncomfortable: her hip-hop literacy, her unwillingness to eat anything but TV dinners in front of the TV, and her voluptuous body, always spilling out of too-casual sportswear. When they first meet, Cheryl observes that the barely-legal Clee was \u201cso much of a woman that for a moment I wasn\u2019t sure what I was.\u201d (Cheryl also takes note of Clee\u2019s \u201caggressively blank expression,\u201d which is a better way of describing what\u2019s happening on Nicki Minaj\u2019s face on the", "cover than my description above, and which made me imagine as I read that Clee looked and moved like Minaj, except white and blond.) In a twist on the standard romantic comedy template, Clee and Cheryl start out as enemies, become collaborators, and then fall in love. The \u201ctwist\u201d is that during the enemy phase, the two women launch a kind of two-woman fight club, with their raw aggression toward one another eventually incorporating role-playing borrowed from Open Palm\u2019s self-defense productions; their collaboration is a baby, carried by Clee and nurtured by Cheryl; and their romance doesn\u2019t have a traditional happy ending.", "In", ", July shows us a planet on which in no two grown humans live the same experience; they\u2019re all wandering around in astronaut helmets full of swirling private language, and the best anyone can hope for is that their head bubble will form a kind of Venn diagram with someone else\u2019s head bubble, if only for a little while. Everything is S&M: the fear of self-expression is so acute that adults ask one another for permission before they act, signing contracts to police their interpersonal interactions, and transferring their desires into what Cheryl\u2019s therapist Ruth-Anne calls \u201can immensely satisfying adult game.\u201d Cheryl and Clee\u2019s hand-to-hand combat has a tangible effect on Cheryl\u2019s life\u2014her psychosomatic illnesses clear up, and right away she feels a kind of liberation: \u201cThis was the opposite of getting mugged. I\u2019d been mugged every single day of my life and this was the first day I wasn\u2019t mugged.\u201d But she also tells herself it\u2019s not real: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t anything, just a re-creation of a simulation of the kind of thing that might happen to a woman if she didn\u2019t keep her wits about her.\u201d", "Though this is her first novel, July is an accomplished writer of short fiction, and within", "live a handful of perfectly drawn short stories, such as when Cheryl shows up for an appointment and accidentally overhears a painful exchange between Ruth-Anne and her own partner in \u201cadult games.\u201d The tissue connecting these segments into an overarching narrative is sometimes a bit too neat (coincidences abound), and sometimes compromised by the fact that Cheryl spends much of the book as a pathologically solipsistic unreliable narrator, although that\u2019s also a selling point\u2014July has an enviable talent for sketching inner life as all-consuming.", "\u2019s depiction of emotional compartmentalization is a new spin on an old theme for July. Her most recent film, 2011\u2019s", ", begins in a relatively familiar indie relationship mode, and then, in its final act, breaks into a kind of science fiction\u2014as though the movie itself has a dissociative disorder that causes it to adopt alternate personalities in order to get through the really difficult stuff without assuming personal responsibility. Oddly, at its least \u201creal,\u201d", "felt the most honest and direct. The idea of telling the truth through a detour manifested itself again in 2014, when July released an art project in the form of an iPhone app called", ", which allows one person to send a message to another through a third party, often a stranger who, GPS reveals, is in current close proximity to the receiver. The third party must deliver the message in person. In a statement about Somebody, July wrote that the app \u201ctwists our love of avatars and outsourcing\u2014every relationship becomes a three-way. The antithesis of the utilitarian efficiency that tech promises, here, finally, is an app that makes us nervous, giddy, and alert to the people around us.\u201d", "I mean, sure, but it\u2019s also a way of shifting responsibility for what you want onto someone you probably don\u2019t even know.

In the novel, as the plot churns along with Cheryl its ever unsuspecting and guileless narrator, this \u201coutsourcing\u201d process feels at best melancholy, and at worst, literally perverted, with none of the utopian potential July ascribes to Somebody.", "July\u2019s interest in transference becomes more, for lack of a better word, fertile, when you consider the ways in which July may be using", "as a vehicle for masking (and thus safely airing) her own feelings about motherhood.

Usually I didn\u2019t get very far\u2014Jack cried and I streamed into motion, forgetting myself again.\u201d But with its near-magical realist flourishes (the sexual fantasies that bleed into real life, and vice versa; a minor subplot in which Cheryl\u2019s house becomes infested with snails) and characters and relationships that seem to intentionally strain credulity, sometimes it feels like", "works too hard at building layers of boxes in which July can bury such kernels gleaned from real life.", "Hardly blind to this busyness, July mirrors such systematic distancing in her story. For instance, Clee doesn\u2019t want to tell Cheryl the name of her baby\u2019s father, and so she writes it down on a piece of paper and puts the paper in a sealed envelope and puts the envelope in a place where she think it can\u2019t be disturbed. But Cheryl does disturb it, and she takes it to Ruth-Anne and asks the therapist to open the envelope, write the name on another piece of paper, hide that new name-branded slip in a place where Cheryl can\u2019t easily get to it, and put the original piece of paper back in a new sealed envelope which Cheryl can put back in Clee\u2019s original hiding place.
