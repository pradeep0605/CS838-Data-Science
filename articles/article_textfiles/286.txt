{"Body": ["Illustration by Emily Flake", "Confronted purely as a physical object, John Berger\u2019s book", "appears to be one of those volumes that\u2019s been designed to be owned rather than read. Bound in raw burlap and printed on thick paper, it intimidates in its material solidity, lacking both the elegance of an expensive coffee table book and the easy accessibility of a simple primer. Dive into it, however, and you\u2019ll discover a rich and loving exploration of art history, at once intellectually acute and deeply personal.", "Now approaching 90, Berger remains best known for", ", his 1972 BBC miniseries and its accompanying", ". Excerpted from his vast array of other writings,", "offers a snapshot of the rest of his career, one that\u2019s been spent in constant conversation with the works of others.", "could have easily been a stolid monument, mere evidence of a lifetime lost to contemplation of the image. Instead, its essays and extracts\u2014ably edited by Tom Overton\u2014are surprisingly flighty, Berger\u2019s style varying from one entry to the next. Read in sequence, they offer a surprisingly vital and uncommonly engaging proof of concept for ideas that Berger has long espoused. Works of art, as Berger proposed in", ", aren\u2019t simply meant to be seen\u2014they\u2019re meant to help us see.", "testifies to both the difficulty, and the rewards, of putting that theory into practice.", "For a book that discusses more than 70 artists, it", "features surprisingly few images of their works. Those that it contains are rarely helpful\u2014always in black and white, sometimes fuzzily reproduced. These images, Berger writes in his preface, \u201care simple memoranda\u201d meant to help focus the attention. A longtime", ", Berger isn\u2019t one to turn up his nose at reproductions. But spare as", "reproductions are, they invite readers to seek out those images on their own terms, creating new encounters in new contexts. More interested in stimulating conversation than in controlling it, Berger never seeks to have the last word.", "To study a painting is to let it study you.", "Of all the images discussed in the book, the most carefully reproduced appears on the cover. One of the Fayum mummy portraits, a collection of funeral images \u201cpainted in the ancient Greek tradition,\u201d it depicts an elegantly appointed woman. Though it looks as if it had been cut from an old issue of", ", it approximates the real thing, thanks in part to the downcast clarity of the subject\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s her gaze\u2014suggesting private sorrows, deeply felt\u2014and those of her fellow mummies that capture Berger\u2019s own as he contemplates these images. He argues that this look inaugurated something new in the history of portraiture.\u00a0\u201cIt was the painter rather than the \u2018model\u2019 who submitted to being looked at,\u201d Berger writes. Contemplating these images today, we recreate this old interaction, subjecting ourselves to inspection by the painted figure. Indeed, this exchange of looks ensures their persistent contemporaneity, perhaps because it lets \u201ctheir individuality feel like our own.\u201d", "Even as he speaks of the Fayum painters in their particularity, this is as close as Berger comes to a universal theory of art: To examine a work is to insert oneself into a chain of glances, a chain in which one is always seeing oneself being seen. Or, to put it differently, to study a painting is to let it study you, which means letting it speak in its own way with its own words. And yet, as Berger writes in a recent essay on Martin Noel, \u201cWhen words are applied to visual art, both lose precision.\u201d If we\u2019re to avoid this \u201cimpasse,\u201d Berger\u2019s work shows, it can only be by letting art change the way that we speak, even, or especially, when we\u2019re speaking of art.", "This is why Berger\u2019s style varies so widely throughout", ", each entry shaped by his encounter with an artist\u2019s creations rather than an attempt to simply describe those creations. The chapter on Titian, for example, takes the form of a series of short letters between Berger and his daughter Katya in which the two negotiate their relationship with one another as they reflect on the 16", "-century painter\u2019s fleshy canvases. Meanwhile, his writings on Goya tend toward the fictional, encompassing an excerpt from his novel", "and a few scenes from", "he wrote with Nella Bielski. In their idiosyncrasies, these passages don\u2019t just capture encounters with art works; they show art underwriting other encounters and other acts of the imagination altogether.", "To discuss a painting is inevitably to discuss what it\u2019s like to stand before that painting. No mere narcissism, acknowledging this fact allows us to dwell on the specificity of each new encounter with each new work. This may be why those such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer who were", "seem to fascinate Berger more than others. As always, what matters most to him here is the subject\u2019s gaze: \u201cWhy does a man paint himself?\u201d Berger asks. \u201cIt is to produce evidence, which will probably outlive him, that he once existed. His look will remain, and the double meaning of the word \u2018look\u2019\u2014signifying both his appearance and his gaze\u2014suggests the mystery or enigma which is contained in that thought.\u201d", "Like the Fayum portraits, Berger suggests, D\u00fcrer\u2019s canvases make explicit what all artworks do: They contemplate us as we contemplate them, showing us what it means to linger over the act of looking. Appropriately,", "revels in this truth at every turn. Instead of explaining, interpreting, or even simply describing, these selections investigate the underpinnings of experience\u2014not what we know, but how we know it. \u201cThe only justification for criticism,\u201d he writes, \u201cis that it allows us to see more clearly.\u201d", "In Berger\u2019s hands, then, art itself is a kind of criticism. It \u201ccannot be used to explain the mysterious,\u201d only to make the mysterious \u201ceasier to notice.\u201d For all that he has written, his genius is evident not in what he says of art, but in his ability to amplify its many voices.", "---", "by John Berger.
