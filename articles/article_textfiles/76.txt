They would have to hide most knowledge of peculiar things from their normal children.", "I guess that would depend on the parents and their situation. I mean, every peculiar family unit is different. If two peculiars are lucky enough to meet and, like, fall in love, and get married, which, you know \u2026", "Yeah. They\u2019re lucky. Because that doesn\u2019t happen too often. If they were in a community or loop of supportive peculiars in a fairly safe place, I think they could be fairly honest with their normal kid. But if there\u2019s danger around, it\u2019s probably better and safer for the kid to know nothing.", "That\u2019s true, the kid might be smart and figure that out, which would be \u2026 that would be a great story, I\u2019m gonna write that down.", "Probably. On the other hand, I think most kids think their parents are peculiar.", "I\u2019m sitting right here, Lyra.", "I really wanted this book to feel like an artifact from the world of the peculiars. You could have found this on Miss Peregrine\u2019s own bookshelf. Woodcuts have a really timeless sort of feel, and they feel like a book that\u2019s a couple hundred years old. And honestly working with photographs is really limiting. I have to find photographs that match the wacky stories I tell. It was much easier to come up with the stories and then give them to the illustrator and have him illustrate something appropriate.", "Los Angeles, which is where I live, happens to be a great place for junk. People have a lot of it and they sell it and trade it: At these big swap meets, many, many hundreds of dealers of junk will descend upon a football field on a Saturday and sell all their stuff.", "I had many. Many many many. But that\u2019s OK! I had more than I knew I would need, which left me a lot of wiggle room when I was writing. Maybe the leftovers will be useful in some way.", "Maybe!

I can guess, but I did not write the screenplay, and I didn\u2019t have much input into the development of the story. But having seen the movie I can say that, cinematically, it works really well.

Which for the movie is so much funnier than having her look like a big brawny teenager.", "Right, a tiny little girl who can pick up boulders is hilarious.", "It\u2019s not the filmmakers\u2019 job to do exactly what the book did. When I heard about the changes but hadn\u2019t seen the movie, yeah, I was like, \u201cHey!\u201d but when I saw it, I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cool.\u201d And I think fans will feel the same way.", "Oh they\u2019re terrifying.
