There\u2019s a growing alt-death movement that\u2019s deeply interested in corpse talk, i.e. how long we should wait to bury the dead, what dead bodies look like, where we should put them. (", "?!) Our increasing willingness to talk about death in recent years could be considered progress\u2014but it\u2019s also something of a posture, which makes it easy to forget that we\u2019re often broaching the subject of mortality in the most superficial of ways.", "Specifically, there\u2019s one kind of death talk that\u2019s still much less accessible: end-of-life care. This topic is complicated and emotionally grueling and won\u2019t succumb to metaphor. It\u2019s also where the most compelling philosophical and moral questions about mortality reside. Our interactions with the not-quite-dead is where our institutional and cultural limitations are revealed most clearly: for instance, the mixed blessing of medical advancements that can keep the virtually dead breathing, and our systemic bias toward doing", ", however futile and debilitating. In her new book,", "Ann Neumann writes of visiting a hospice patient hooked to a ventilator while his wife, still hoping for a recovery, frets that he can\u2019t eat. Denial is a fog, obscuring what\u2019s right in front of us. Neumann\u2019s is the latest in a series of books on the American way of dying\u2014how it should go and how it does go, which are not usually the same thing.", "This book hammers home the barriers that prevent dying people from getting what they want.", "Neumann, a journalist, begins her book lamenting her father\u2019s death, as well as its location: in a hospice facility instead of at home, despite his wishes and her best efforts. Her grief and regret eventually prompt her to study how Americans deal with the end of life and how it could be better, exploring the religious, legal, and medical institutions that influence and restrict us. At the heart of her book is the difficult question of what makes for a \u201cgood\u201d death. Neumann says this is particular to the individual, but at the very least, a good death is characterized by acceptance rather than denial, with a minimum of pain and suffering. To that end, she writes sympathetically about assisted suicide, suggesting that, as an antidote to the prevailing exhortation that the fatally ill \u201cnot go gentle into that good night,\u201d we \u201ccalculate pain and suffering into the costs of futile care.\u201d", "Over and over, Neumann hammers home the barriers that prevent dying people from getting what they want. She explores the cultural divide over the fate of Terri Schiavo, kept artificially alive for so long while in a persistent vegetative state. She points out the importance of advanced planning, but warns about the possible curtailing of your options\u2014legal documents be damned\u2014should you be carted from a catastrophic accident to a Catholic hospital. And she recounts the story of an ailing elderly couple booted from their assisted-living home because they were exercising their legal right to cease eating and drinking. (Disclosure: I once interviewed Neumann, a visiting scholar at New York University\u2019s Center for Religion and Media, about end-of-life care.)", "Neumann also writes about becoming a hospice volunteer, and I found the stories about her patients to be the most fascinating and, pardon me, the most alive parts of the book. One patient, whom she visits almost daily, just wants to hold her hand and watch", "; another flirts with her as she holds up his frail body. She writes that her patients\u2019 daily suffering, the incremental losses of functions and dignity, clash with a fantasy she\u2019s long held of the perfect exit\u2014something sudden and noble, \u201ca romance where our loved one gives us one last meaningful look.\u201d Of course, that fantasy is not just Neumann\u2019s. It\u2019s deeply embedded in our culture, and to understand why, it helps to consider the title of her book.", "Willy Somma", "The notion of the \u201cgood death\u201d dates back at least to the 19", "century, when people believed one should die at home, surrounded by family, to make sure the one\u2019s soul was all right and heaven-bound. It was an idealization of a much harsher reality, and there was a kind of script the dying and the family were supposed to follow, filled with proclamations of religious belief. In recent years, a variation on this concept of a spiritually satisfying Good Death has been revived by an assortment of death-positive activists who rightly see this country\u2019s pervasive denial of mortality as a factor in many drawn-out, over-medicalized deaths. Some argue that keeping the dying at home, and caring for their bodies after death, can offer transcendent closure. When I was interviewing people involved in the", ", they talked of the restful beauty of their loved ones\u2019 corpses, of sensing souls depart while they kept vigil over the bodies for days. The instinct to make something beautiful out of grief strikes me as admirable and heartbreaking and very, very human. And we can try for it. But in life we don\u2019t always get what we want. So why should death be any different?", "Sometimes, despite our best efforts, our loved ones die in the hospital, and sometimes, we don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming even though we should. Frank end-of-life conversations with doctors would make such surprise endings less common, but there\u2019s also human nature to contend with. When the odds are slim, hope makes would-be statistical outliers out of all of us. Hospital deaths often resemble a flight of steps: a series of tumbles interspersed with plateaus, a true trajectory we can see only in hindsight.", "As a former EMT, I will say there are things worse than death.", "", "", "", "", "At the very least, if you have to take the big trip, having Neumann by your side wouldn\u2019t be a bad way to go.

She buys strings for one patient\u2019s broken and beloved cuatro, and helps a dying AIDS patient articulate his pain so he can start on Methadone. (\u201cHighly addictive,\u201d the nurse says. \u201cHe\u2019s dying,\u201d Neumann replies.) She lingers on her four-year friendship with one patient in particular, a doctor named Evelyn, for whom she procures discontinued Twinkies and high-quality pot.
