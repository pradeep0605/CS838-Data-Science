{"Body": ["Illustration by Ozge Samanci", "Who was William Shakespeare, really? What was he like as a person? George Bernard Shaw once quipped that \u201ceverything we know about Shakespeare can be got into a half-hour sketch,\u201d but if you limit yourself to verifiable facts about his life, a half-hour is too long. We don\u2019t have anything in his handwriting beyond his signature and", ". We lack original drafts of his scripts. We are missing any books he may have owned. We don\u2019t even know for sure on what day he was born, nor are we absolutely certain whether his wife\u2019s last name was Hathaway or Whateley, or whether her first name was Anne or Anna or Agnes. For Shakespeare, the kinds of sources that biographers rely on either never existed, are lost, or, in the case of his famous will, might be corrupted. Much of what we think we know of the Bard\u2019s life is handed down from tradition and based on the first biography of him, written by Nicholas Rowe nearly a century after his death.", "Into this vacuum of knowable fact have rushed innumerable biographical studies of the Bard; an Amazon search for \u201cShakespeare biography\u201d returns more than 4,000 results, many of which bear no more relationship to their subject\u2019s actual life than the film", ". Biographies of Shakespeare often end up\u2014like", "they rightfully mock\u2014building their assertions upon a latticework of", "s and", "es and", "s that suddenly, a few pages later, become", "s. The end results can be illuminating, though mostly of the biases, interests, and quirks of their writers. The better ones\u2014in particular, Jonathan Bate\u2019s dazzling", "a biography of Shakespeare\u2019s mind\u2014know that pinning the Bard down is impossible. They instead place what we know of Shakespeare in counterpoint with both his plays and his time, illuminating all three in unconventional ways.", ", a new anthology of biographical essays about important people from Shakespeare\u2019s life edited by Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells, aims to fill in as much of the space surrounding Shakespeare as possible, so that a clearer outline of WS\u2019s shape can emerge. In the book\u2019s 25 portraits, we meet everyone from Shakespeare\u2019s parents and siblings, to his wife and children, to his business partners, writing partners, theatrical partners, patrons, editors, and London landlords. The central problem, of course, is that in many of these cases (particularly the women and Shakespeare\u2019s son Hamnet, who died at age 11) we know even less about them than we do about Shakespeare. The shapes surrounding our emerging outline are themselves often mysterious and, as many of the people are interconnected, contradictory from article to article.", "Yet an outline emerges nonetheless. Over the course of the book, we come to see a Shakespeare devoted to his family\u2014or at least his family", "\u2014and to enlarging its place at Stratford. We get a glimpse of his thrift, and lack of dedication to his adopted London, in his peripatetic renter\u2019s life there. We get to know his friendship with Ben Jonson, who is something like the Salieri to his Amadeus, and some of his uncredited collaborators, including George Wilkins, the violent pimp who wrote the first two acts of", ". And, through a brilliant essay by the University of Roehampton\u2019s Andy Kesson, we come to understand why, during Shakespeare\u2019s early career, other playwrights felt so threatened by him, and why they wrote of him as a crowd-pleasing lightweight.", "Kesson\u2019s essay on Shakespeare\u2019s early collaborators in the theater is the most essential in the volume, provoking a new understanding of the infamous 1592 pamphlet", ".", ", attributed to playwright Robert Greene but likely ghost-written, savaged an early-career Shakespeare as a \u201cpeasant\u201d and \u201can upstart crow beautified with our feathers\u201d who possesses a \u201ctiger\u2019s heart wrapped in a player\u2019s hide,\u201d a reference to Shakespeare\u2019s own", ",", "which describes Queen Margaret in nearly identical terms. In the typical reading of", "the author is complaining that Shakespeare is a hick from the sticks, doesn\u2019t have the right education, and has the audacity to beautify his plays with the feathers of courtly style while being, in truth, as base and vicious as a tiger. This has led some scholars to feel defensive of Shakespeare to the point of outright hostility toward the", "(", ".", "Kesson\u2019s take instead firmly places both", "and Shakespeare in the context of their time, a time in which the word", "did not yet exist and the first real theaters had just been built. Shakespeare, according to Kesson, represented a changing of the guard away from \u201ca generation of theatre practitioners \u2026 for whom the playhouses were completely new,\u201d to \u201canother \u2026 who had grown up as the playhouses opened.\u201d To them, Shakespeare \u201cwas an oddity.\u201d Kesson demands that we see", "as its contemporaries would have, as a response to a still-unproven actor-turned-writer who was largely employed in rewriting the plays of the very writers he was about to supersede and whose only original work thus far was the", "trilogy.", "Kesson\u2019s isn\u2019t the only revisionist take in", ", which in general assumes a reader versed in Shakespeare\u2019s life and major works who has read at least one other biography of him. Bart Van Es argues that Shakespeare\u2019s shift in actors from Will Kemp, whose clowning style birthed Bottom in", ", to Robert Armin, whose literate wit inflects Touchstone in", "and the Fool in", ", may not have come by Shakespeare freezing Kemp out of the company, but because Kemp realized he could make more money touring Europe. David Fallow uses Elizabethan business and tax regulations to make the case that Shakespeare\u2019s father, John, may have been a successful and canny businessman, instead of the debt-riddled failure he\u2019s often assumed to be. If this is true, Fallow muses, Shakespeare\u2019s \u201clost years\u201d (the time from age 21\u201328 we know nothing about) could simply be an apprenticeship in his father\u2019s business, and he may have gone to London initially on his father\u2019s behalf. Katherine Scheil points out in her chapter on Shakespeare\u2019s wife, Anne, that the documentary evidence for their supposedly unhappy marriage is very thin and that we are left with \u201ca complex web of knowledge\u201d and a \u201chaunting sense of absence in the archives about this enigmatic woman.\u201d", "The weakest of the revisionists is Germaine Greer, whose chapter on Shakespeare\u2019s younger daughter, Judith, and her husband, Thomas Quiney, is essentially historical fiction. Greer has no concrete evidence to support her assertions that Judith met Thomas because she was in service in his house, or that Thomas trained as a vintner, or that Thomas impregnating another woman \u201cgave Judith a chance. I imagine that [Thomas\u2019s mother] simply asked Judith to put Thomas out of Wheeler\u2019s reach by marrying him.\u201d She even says that Shakespeare made \u201ca settlement\u201d with John Hall, Judith\u2019s brother-in-law, \u201cthat made her elder sister Shakespeare\u2019s sole heir,\u201d before revealing three pages later that this idea, which serves as the foundation for much of her entire chapter, is \u201csupposition.\u201d", "Fortunately, most of the rest of the scholarship is not so dubious. Often, the joys of reading", "can be found as much in how the writers come to their conclusions as in the conclusions themselves. The writers circle the same scant pieces of documentary evidence (the will with its \u201csecond best bed\u201d as Anne Hathaway\u2019s only bequest, two lawsuits, Jonson\u2019s writings about Shakespeare, three epitaphs,", ") again and again, as if they are hawks looking for any morsel of truth that can be found. They explore tree-ring dating, controversies over the town vicarage in Stratford, theater regulations, publishing business practices, land enclosure laws, and the history of English medicine. The result is an illuminating series of investigative portraits of everyday Elizabethans who just happened to know the greatest writer in the English language.", "Shakespeare took great care in ensuring a legacy of property, money, and name that would live beyond him, yet his family line ends within a few generations.", ", he appears to have taken little care to preserve his artistic legacy, yet this has proven immortal. This irony suffuses even the driest of", "\u2019s chapters with a palpable longing, for both their ostensible subjects and for the ultimate subject of the Bard himself. Graham Holderness\u2019 beautiful essay on Hamnet Shakespeare best articulates this feeling, as he searches for evidence of Hamnet in Shakespeare\u2019s own writing: \u201cHere we find at once the most intimate, yet the most remote of contingencies; the most irresistible, but the most inconclusive of connections.\u201d", "is filled with these intimate, remote contingencies and irresistible, inconclusive connections. Like Orlando wandering the Forest of Arden for some glimpse of his Rosalind in", ", the scholars featured in", "know their subjects are just out of reach but can\u2019t stop searching for them anyway.
