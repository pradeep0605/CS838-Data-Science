Dreicer & Co.\u2019s gallery was a replica of a salon at Versailles; Theodore B. Starr offered two viewing rooms, one in the French Louis XVI style and the other in the English Adams style. From pretending to be Europeans, American jewelers progressed to conquering Europe. Tiffany & Co. opened a Paris branch as early as 1850 and a London outpost around 1870.

(Today, JAR continues the tradition by spurning conventional gems in favor of colorful semiprecious stones like tsavorite garnets, fire opals, and black spinels.)
