There are too many things to be said, many of which are too obvious to warrant saying. Every review of a new book by Martin Amis must, in some way, be a review", "Martin Amis\u2014a reflection on the State of Amis, on the current condition of his career, and an accounting of the net worth of that career to begin with. Above all, the question that must be addressed is that of whether this book is A) a \u201c", ",\u201d or B) further evidence of a long decline. (There are other, subsidiary questions to be considered, many of which have to do with whatever casually incendiary remarks\u2014on the issues of religion, race, gender, global politics, children\u2019s literature\u2014the man may have made in the public arena in the run-up to the publication of the book.)", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "I went so far as to write a draft of this review set in a parallel universe in which", "was the debut novel of an obscure British author I had happened to stumble across by sheer chance, a book by a writer only vaguely remembered for", "The idea of this parallel universe Amis was that it would allow me to read and write about", "in a contextual vacuum.

Because aside from being maybe the best novel Amis has written since", ", it\u2019s also the culmination of an endeavor he\u2019s been pursuing for at least that long.", "stands as Amis\u2019 latest reckoning with the incomprehensible darkness of 20", "-century history. 1991\u2019s formally daring", "which reversed the temporal trajectory of the Holocaust, got snarled and flattened in the gears of its own narrative apparatus; 2002\u2019s nonfiction book about Stalin,", "was deeply weird and sometimes dazzlingly misjudged; 2006\u2019s", "concerned itself with a pair of brothers imprisoned in a gulag. None of those books, for all their gleaming sentences and paragraphs, came close to the thing Amis has been trying to pull off for much of his career: a successful accommodation of his own irreducibly comic talent with the deathly weight of recent European history.", ", in addressing itself to the notoriously unfunny subject of the Holocaust (to what one character calls \u201cthe near farcical", "of the German hatred\u201d), gets nearer to that success than Amis has ever gotten\u2014and nearer, certainly, than would be allowed for by those critics who claim that Amis has fundamentally mistaken the nature of his talent. (\u201cIf Martin Amis had stuck to writing about smoking, shagging and snooker, he could have been the next Nick Hornby,\u201d as the English journalist", ", insanely.)", "It\u2019s a pretty solid zinger; if I had a time machine, I\u2019d be happy to travel back to the \u201930s and read it aloud to Hitler himself.", "The book opens with Angelus \u201cGolo\u201d Thomsen\u2014the first of Amis\u2019 three narrators\u2014taking an erotic interest in the sight of a woman in a white dress, as she walks in the shade of a maple grove with her two daughters. From the opening words, you\u2019re immediately in the presence of that shrewd and indivisible voice, which cannot be other than itself, cannot but assert itself as Amis\u2019: \u201cI was no stranger to the flash of lightning; I was no stranger to the thunderbolt. Enviably experienced in these matters, I was no stranger to the cloudburst\u2014the cloudburst, and then the sunshine and the rainbow.\u201d This kind of rhetorical repetition has always been one of the dominant features of Amis\u2019 prose style; it\u2019s hard to think of another writer,", ", who has gotten so much mileage out of stylized reiteration. (The repetition point is, of course,", "", "", "", ". This is the kind of thing I was trying to avoid, you see, with the parallel universe conceit.) This gorgeously rendered scene is initially suggestive of some pastoral idyll: \u201cA late afternoon in midsummer, with minutely glinting midges ... My notebook lay open on a tree stump, and the breeze was flicking inquisitively through its pages.\u201d Perhaps, you might think, the setting is a university campus, and we are in the company of a scholarly young coxcomb\u2014he describes his manner, after all, as \u201cfloridly donnish\u201d, offering an image of himself as dressed in \u201ctailored tweed jacket and twills\u201d.", "But this is not the case; we are not in Oxford, or anywhere like it: The novel\u2019s setting, we quickly learn\u2014its eponymous \u201czone of interest\u201d\u2014is Auschwitz. Thomsen is a high-ranking Nazi, a (fictional) nephew of", ". The woman who has caught his eye is Hannah Doll, wife of Paul Doll, the concentration camp\u2019s commandant, based, more or less, on", ".", "Throughout the book, the baton of narrative is passed between Thomsen, Paul Doll, and a Polish Jew named Szmul, a member of the so-called Sonderkommando\u2014the elect of the damned who were charged with the disposal of the bodies of their fellow Jews. Amis handles the switches of register with suave composure. It\u2019s Thomsen who occupies the stylistic high ground, delivering his portion of the book with delicate Nabokovian relish and self-regard. He describes his own body, for instance, at impressive length, from the \u201cFlemish chute of the nose, the disdainful pleat of the mouth,\u201d to the \u201cextensile penis, classically compact in repose (with pronounced prepuce).\u201d Thomsen seems occasionally troubled by the nature of his work as a middle-manager in a bureaucracy of slaughter, describing himself at one point as a Schreibtischtater\u2014\u201ca", "\u201d;\u00a0 specifically, he oversees the Auschwitz-based project, run by the chemical giant IG Farben and manned by Jewish slave labor, to develop synthetic fuel and rubber for the war effort.", "For much of the book, though, Thomsen is largely preoccupied with trying to get the Kommandant\u2019s wife into the sack. Being the nephew of Hitler\u2019s personal secretary gives him a certain license in this arena, a certain leeway for insubordination, though even in the engine-room of the Holocaust, social norms continue to obtain. The notion of sexual misdemeanor seems unspeakably trivial in the context of the book\u2019s setting, an absurdity of which Thomsen seems grimly aware. Early in the book, during a moment alone with Hannah at the entrance to a greenhouse, he wonders whether it would be \u201cso strange, really, to urge her on inside and to lean into her and gather in my dropped hands the white folds of her dress? Would it? Here? Where everything was allowed?\u201d", "Of the three first-person narrators, only Thomsen is given unrestricted access to the lavish treasury of Amis\u2019 prose. Szmul\u2019s sections are unremittingly bleak and harrowingly effective\u2014and notably short, as though he were running out of things to say about the theater of horrors in which he has been forced to act as stage manager. \u201cNearly all our work,\u201d he writes, \u201cis done among the dead, with the heavy scissors, the pliers and the mallets, the buckets of petrol refuse, the ladles, the grinders.\u201d Doll\u2019s narration, though, is curtailed by other means: the dull constraints of his intellect and his imagination. With Doll, Amis is straining his sentences through a filter of clich\u00e9. We first encounter him after a stressful incident involving the processing of a trainload of new arrivals, which he informs us has left him with \u201ca splitting headache.\u201d We\u2019re getting the full linguistic dramatization of the banality of evil here, in other words\u2014an idea which has, of course, long been a standard in the repertoire of Nazi platitudes. Doll\u2019s eyes are resolutely averted from his own depravity, and from the unprecedented horror of the \u201cProjekt\u201d he is overseeing. Of the work that Szmul and the other Sonderkommandos do on his behalf\u2014the relocation and rendering and disposal of corpses, or \u201cSt\u00fccke\u201d (pieces)\u2014he has this to say: \u201cYou know, I never cease to marvel at the abyss of moral destitution to which certain human beings are willing to descend.\u201d", "This blindness is the most compelling thing about Doll, the blank center of his corruption. He\u2019s a vivid creation, a metastasized joke of a character who is both one of history\u2019s most prolific mass murderers and a basically incompetent bureaucrat, known to his colleagues as \u201cthe old boozer.\u201d Amis effectively evokes Doll\u2019s inability to apprehend the horror of himself. At one point, disgusted by the smell of death emanating from the camp\u2014from the chimneys, the smoke, the bodies\u2014he feels \u201cas if I were in one of those cloacal dreams that all of us have from time to time\u2014you know, where you seem to turn into a frothing geyser of hot filth, like a stupendous oil strike, and it just keeps on coming and coming and piling up everywhere no matter what you try and do.\u201d It\u2019s not the imagery that is most unsettling here, but Doll\u2019s matter-of-fact assertion\u2014his ability to convince himself\u2014that this is normal, that this is a dream \u201call of us\u201d have.", "But Doll\u2019s blindness is also a character flaw in another, more technical, sense: Amis tends to overdramatize it, and so, as a character in a novel, he\u2019s pretty flawed. Amis is temperamentally a satirist, of course, and so his tendency is to overdramatize pretty much everything. His most memorable characters are sophisticated studies of brute grotesquery: Think of Keith Talent in", "; think of John Self in", "; think, for that matter, of the character named \u201cMartin Amis\u201d who has been the protagonist of a long-running episodic farce in the newspapers of the English-speaking world for the past 30 years.", "Photo by Michael Lionstar", "Doll\u2019s animating principle as a character is that of dramatic irony: We are constantly being made aware of the extent to which we know more than he does about himself, of his utter incapacity to see himself for what he is. At one point, he announces \u201cI\u2019ve come to believe that it was all a tragic mistake.\u201d He\u2019s talking not about the Holocaust, but about his marriage: \u201cI turn things over in my mind and, yes, I\u2019ve come to believe that it was all a tragic mistake\u2014marrying such a large woman.\u201d (Because he can\u2019t beat her up, you see: \u201cShe\u2019s too fucking big.\u201d)", "The irony here is too clearly superintended by an authorial hand, and so Doll stops seeming like a complex and self-determined individual and starts to look like very much like an inanimate object of editorial intent. And Amis keeps doing this throughout, keeps making him say things obviously intended for the purposes of his mockery. At one point, he quotes approvingly a passage from", "on how \u201cMarxism itself systematically plans to hand the world over to the Jews\u201d, and then insists that \u201cWell, you can\u2019t argue with logic of that calibre. No:", ". Next question, please.\u201d There\u2019s a strange collapse of the distinction between the voice of an intellectually coarse and heedless character and the editorial voice of his author; Doll\u2019s approval, in other words, sounds as though it\u2019s being pitched in the kind of ironic register we know to be beyond his range. (Amis\u2019 last novel, the muddled but often very funny", ", was similarly marred by a cumulatively antagonizing insistence on reminding the reader that Lionel speaks with a heavy working-class London accent\u2014on specifying that \u201cpaddock\u201d is delivered \u201cwith the full plosive on the terminal", ".\u201d)", "These aren\u2019t trivial lapses, but they\u2019re not structural deficiencies either; I found myself mostly willing to overlook them, to see them as manifestations of Amis\u2019 internalized dispute with the conventions of realism. It\u2019s hard to think of a writer more relentlessly vivid and precise in his evocations of the world, and less bothered about the creation of psychologically convincing characters. One of the perennial criticisms of his work is that his immense comic and stylistic talents are ill-served by his pursuit of profoundly serious subject matters, that he keeps overreaching his range by going after these great and terrible historical themes. There is truth to this, of course: Amis has never written anything as good as", ", his brutal comic evisceration of the demented acquisitiveness of the 1980s. (But then who has? Seriously, I would like to know: Who has?)", "What this criticism fails to take into account, though, is the extent to which his Dickensian flair, his fixation on the most violent and debased aspects of humanity, find a commensurate subject in the darkest abominations of the last century. Paul Doll is a kind of nightmare version of Lionel Asbo, or", "\u2019 Keith Talent\u2014a small and vicious man, made large in this instance by history\u2019s terrible accommodation of his grotesquerie.", "\"Should the Holocaust Be Off Limits to a Comic Writer Like Martin Amis?\" Seriously? Nothing should be off limits to ANY writer.", "", "-bunkhabit", "", "", "", "For all his occasional clumsiness, there are few contemporary novelists so skilled at writing these kinds of characters, who can render violence and stupidity with such forceful style and intelligence. The word", "never appears in", "; he is only ever spoken of in glancing terms, by euphemisms or circumlocutions. But we do get one glimpse of him, when Bormann asks his nephew, Thomsen, whether he\u2019s ever seen the F\u00fchrer up close. Thomsen says that he was in the same room as him just once, at Bormann\u2019s own wedding in 1929. He looked, Thomsen recalls, \u201cso much like a pale, pouchy, and cruelly overworked head waiter that every civilian there, I felt, was trying very hard not to hand him a tip.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty solid zinger; if I had a time machine, I\u2019d be happy to travel back to the \u201930s and read it aloud to Hitler himself.", "But this turns out to be a much more volatile irony, and a more resonant one, than any of Amis\u2019 more controlled and controlling satirical interventions. Because it doesn\u2019t so much cut Hitler down to size\u2014what would be the point of that?\u2014as deepen the enigma of how such a drab and mean character could ever have razed Europe to the ground, could have acquired such catastrophic power in the first place. The attempt to pin him down in this way only serves to illuminate the futility of trying to understand him. When you turn the final page of", ", you\u2019re confronted by his photographic image; there he is, the novel\u2019s unnamed and largely unconsidered antagonist, with his pouched eyes and his feeble mustache and his tight little mouth, staring past you in all his unknowable humanness. We\u2019re none the wiser, and he\u2019s still there. Neither art nor history could ever illuminate that dismal image.", "---", "by Martin Amis.
