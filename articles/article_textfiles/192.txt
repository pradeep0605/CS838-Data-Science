He whacks a girl on the head with the seesaw and yells throughout story hour. Laurie\u2019s daily updates on Charles\u2019 misdeeds, which often force the entire kindergarten class to be kept after school, soon turn Charles into a kind of icon among the Jackson family: Laurie is told", "being a Charles when he pulls a wagon full of mud through the kitchen. Jackson\u2019s husband even invokes Charles when he makes a mess of the living room. For a brief period Laurie reports that Charles is behaving better, but then one Friday he reveals that Charles convinced an innocent classmate to say a very, very bad word. (\u201cShe said it", ",\u201d an awestruck Laurie tells his parents. \u201cCharles told her to say it", "\u201d)", "Jackson worries about her little boy falling under Charles\u2019 influence\u2014she can already see that he\u2019s transformed from a \u201csweet-voiced nursery-school tot\u201d to a \u201clong-trousered, swaggering character who forgot to stop at the corner and wave goodbye.\u201d But her husband reassures her: \u201cBound to be people like Charles in the world. Might as well meet them now as later.\u201d", "As the first PTA meeting of the year approaches, Jackson cannot wait to encounter the mother of the amazing Charles. What must she be like? \u201cInvite her over for a cup of tea after the meeting,\u201d her husband says. \u201cI want to get a look at her.\u201d", "And now you must forgive me for presenting the denouement of the story precisely in Jackson\u2019s words, because they offer a textbook case in how a writer may, through pacing and understatement, land a reader as an expert fisherman lands a lake trout:", "That\u2019s the end of the story, and there I am, flopping around on the boat\u2019s deck, gasping for air. Notice how perfectly Jackson reels me in, dropping just enough hints so that I arrive at the proper conclusion mere sentences before Jackson herself does. (There\u2019s pleasure in being misled by Jackson the writer, who\u2019s more clever than me, but pleasure too in being just a touch more clever than Jackson the mother.) Notice how easily she intertwines the pride we feel in our children and the anxiety we feel about their behavior; look how she gaily takes her own feet out from under herself for the sake of earning our trust as a storyteller.", "It\u2019s a twist worthy of the author of \u201c", ",\u201d which is the tale for which most readers know Shirley Jackson, and the confidence of her storytelling reminds the reader that in addition to that standard Jackson wrote many other stories and", "of psychological suspense. But the story of Charles also demonstrates how much of the way most of us depict parenting when", "tell our stories was presaged by Jackson\u2019s slim, wonderful books.", "When you read these books\u2014I suggest perusing them, martini in hand, while your children (or better your friends\u2019 children, for whom you are babysitting) run around shrieking\u2014you\u2019ll see every parenting stance you\u2019ve ever adopted, every parent-story trope you\u2019ve ever told or heard, expressed more perfectly than you ever could have. Airy unconcern about the state of one\u2019s home, marriage, or children, masking a deeper unspoken acknowledgment that all will forever exist in a state of chaos? Shirley Jackson did it first. Outward civility masking resentment toward the perfect parents one knows? Shirley Jackson smiles wider than you ever have, and seethes more fiercely than you ever could. Struggling with your children noticing and adopting the vices that you yourself cannot shed? When Shirley Jackson finds a pack of cigarettes inside her son\u2019s fort, she tells him \u201cwith some heat that it was perfectly all right with me if he wanted to smoke and stunt his growth and ruin his wind for baseball and basketball and football and ping-pong; it was a silly habit, I told him, expensive and useless, and if he wanted to smoke he could buy his own cigarettes and stop taking mine.\u201d", "Photo by Laurence Hyman", "Though Jackson\u2019s household was a traditional one for its time\u2014with her husband, the literary critic Stanley Hyman, disappearing into the office to type and Jackson handling the housework and child-rearing\u2014the books still feel contemporary both in Jackson\u2019s resistance to the drudgery of housework and in her feminist frustration about the way domesticity changes one\u2019s self-image. Once you were a carefree young person, and now you\u2019re some other creature, a person you barely recognize. Here\u2019s Shirley Jackson tartly addressing that subject: \u201cI was not bitter about being a faculty wife, very much, although it", "occur to me once or twice that young men who were apt to go on and become college teachers someday might \u2026 wear some large kind of identifying badge,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe way it is now, almost any girl is apt to find herself hardening slowly into a faculty wife when all she actually thought she was doing was just getting married.\u201d", "Shirley Jackson smiles wider than you ever have, and seethes more fiercely than you ever could.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the books\u2019 very existence suggests there was a bit more going on in that household than the books themselves imply; at no point does the character of Shirley Jackson shoo her children away to write, yet she was during the period of their childhoods monumentally productive, completing short stories and novels, and indeed selling the lightly fictionalized pieces that would eventually become these memoirs to", ",", "and elsewhere. I hope Stanley at least took the kids out on the weekends.", "However else she was spending her time, Jackson was paying close attention to her children. I\u2019ve never read anyone better at, for example, portraying the odd (and maddening, if you must hear them every day) speech patterns of young children. Just listen to 4-year-old Sally, talking to her hung-over mother in the kitchen one morning: \u201cWell, I told Amy\u2019s mother that I did not have any breakfast, breakfast, because my mommy did not wake up and give it to me, mommy. And Amy\u2019s mother said I was a poor baby, baby, and she gave me cereal and fruit, cereal, and she said there, dear, and she gave me chocolate milk and I", "remember to say thank you, remember.\u201d Ah! I want both to hug her and strangle her, as Jackson surely wanted to do at that moment, as", "parents feel at least some of the time. At least I hope they do.", "The even good humor of Jackson\u2019s prose makes her voice feel perfectly unflappable, even at moments of great flappiness. The disparity is often exquisitely comic or (when she so chooses) quite moving. In", ", 8-year-old Laurie is struck by a car while riding his bike. \u201cI can remember with extraordinary clarity,\u201d Jackson writes,", "that one of the people in the crowd which gathered handed me a lighted cigarette, I can remember saying reasonably that we all ought not to be standing in the middle of the road like this, I can remember the high step up into the ambulance. When they told us at the hospital, late that night, that everything was going to be all right, we came home and I finished drying the breakfast dishes.", "The restraint with which this story is told\u2014the way she supplies only the barest of details about the vast gulf between those dishes being washed in the morning and dried late that night\u2014is what gives the story its power.", "As with all exceptional stories of parenting, the purest joys in", "and", "come from the recognition that everything you\u2019ve felt and feared and worried about has been felt and feared and worried about before.
