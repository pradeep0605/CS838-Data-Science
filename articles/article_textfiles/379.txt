Lionel Shriver explains that she completed the novel in 1998 but couldn\u2019t find a publisher. She blames this failure on her \u201cpoisonous\u201d sales record. \u201cPerhaps more importantly,\u201d she adds, \u201cmy American compatriots largely dismissed terrorism as Foreigners\u2019 Boring Problem.\u201d Over the next decade, her sales grew, and with 9/11 the profile of terrorism grew as well. Shriver goes on: \u201cI was obliged to put the novel on ice, because a book that treated this issue with a light touch would have been perceived as in poor taste.\u201d", "There\u2019s so much that\u2019s wrong with this paragraph. First and foremost, there\u2019s Shriver\u2019s condescending tone about provincial Americans of 1998 and their supposedly dismissive attitude toward terrorism. (In 1998, al-Qaida bombed the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya.) Shriver, American by birth, has lived for over 20 years in the United Kingdom, and there\u2019s a whiff of snobbery in the implication that she", "to be one of those people, but fortunately has moved on to the higher cultural elevations of Europe, leaving all us dumbasses behind.", "So first the book went unpublished because terrorism was unimportant to Americans. Then it languished because terrorism was", "important to Americans. There\u2019s a trend emerging here, no? One that Shriver seems to refuse to see. Here, I\u2019ll spell it out: Publishers did not want to publish the book. (This despite publishing 10 other Shriver novels, including the best-selling", "Shriver\u2019s determination to blame her nonpublication on her audience reminds me of an ad I used to see on TV in which the wife asks the husband if her pants make her butt look big and he replies, \u201cIt\u2019s not the pants!\u201d It\u2019s not the audience. It is, dare I say, the book.", "Maybe Shriver includes all these caveats because she senses she didn\u2019t quite pull the thing off. She set out to write a fizzy book about terrorism. While that goal does have delightfully perverse potential, some readers will understandably have arguments with such a project. Shriver fails to figure out a way to stave off these arguments. She doesn\u2019t use satire to make a discernible larger point about terrorism, except maybe that it\u2019s pointless. Not only that, but she fails to achieve the goal itself. The book is the opposite of fizzy. It is flat. The plot beggars belief, and the whole unfunny thing is overlong by at least 100 pages.", "I weary just thinking about Edgar, her protagonist\u2014though even that relatively neutral word is too heroic-sounding to describe this basically wet main character. When he arrives in Barba, he takes the place of Barrington Saddler, a wildly charismatic journo who\u2019s disappeared mysteriously. Barrington is the kind of person around whom events and people naturally cluster. Says one of the other journalists: \u201cHe goes to Haiti, Duvalier\u2019s overthrown. To Africa, bingo, Ethiopia obliges him a famine. He goes to Moscow, there\u2019s a military coup. He goes on", "in Israel and bang, Rabin\u2019s assassinated. ... That bastard had such a string of world-class events behind him that you had to start wondering if he made them happen.\u201d", "Edgar finds his feet a bit small to fill Barrington\u2019s shoes, but somehow can\u2019t escape the guy. He lives in Barrington\u2019s former digs, works at Barrington\u2019s job, and falls in love with Barrington\u2019s girl. He feels like a second stringer, and chafes at the role, but soon is forced to become a more major player when Barrington begins to pay him secret (and possibly imaginary) visits. Edgar finds himself enmeshed in a complicated game with the SOB, and the book veers from the merely tedious to the entirely implausible.", "Shriver\u2018s previous books have linked psychological acuity to plot. What her people do usually seems to flow out of who they are. But in this book, the psychological profiles of her characters are both labored and one-dimensional, a neat trick. While the strategy of placing an unappealing secondary character at the center of the story is certainly a proven approach, Shriver fails to make Edgar interesting, or even interestingly annoying. We learn that his congenital second-bestness goes back to his childhood as a fat kid; and then the author hammers the point in totally unnecessary scenes of backstory. Other characters don\u2019t fare much better. Barrington Saddler never emerges as much more than a womanizing charmer, though we do learn that this role can have a dark side. And the love interest, Nicola, is little more than a pretty assemblage of quirks.", "Suki Dhanda", "Of course none of this would matter if the book were funny; Wodehouse never, after all, bothers to make us care about Jeeves\u2019 childhood. But it\u2019s not. It feels instead like a long hike up a switchback trail in a deep forest: lots of work, lots of backing and forthing, no vista. The stuff about Barba, for instance, should be pointedly comic\u2014why invent a region in your satirical novel if you can\u2019t be bothered to make up a discernible culture for it, or at the very least a bunch of funny names? Your invented world should at least aspire to the Grand Fenwick of", ", even if it doesn\u2019t quite stretch toward the Zembla in Nabokov\u2019s", ". But Barba never really impresses itself upon our imagination. The buildings, Shriver tells us, are of a \u201csavings-and-loan architecture.\u201d Fair enough, the architecture is dull. But could we take it bit further? And we never really get to know the natives, who are described as \u201ceasygoing.\u201d", "The few nongeneric details are lamely imagined. For instance, the hairy pear, a local noxious weed, comes up again and again: \u201cThe testicular blob had the pulpy give of a fig, though the scraggly inch-long threads on its skin were coarse. It was something like a kiwi on testosterone, or Cousin Itt from", "reincarnated as a fruit.\u201d This is both overwritten and unfunny, the signal tone of the book.", "Of course we ought not to hate books because of their author\u2019s notes.
