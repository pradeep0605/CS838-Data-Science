Charged with pulling detritus out of coal shipments, boys as young as 8 hunched over an ever-flowing stream of minerals, plunging in their hands to pull out slate and other rubbish. Many lost fingers or had limbs torn off by faulty machinery. Some fell down coal chutes and were smothered to death. Most, later in life, experienced horrific medical conditions like black lung. For this work, they were paid 40 cents a day.", "Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for", ".

Conservative activists quickly contrived a lawsuit against the act\u2014and won at the Supreme Court, where five justices", "the child labor law unconstitutional. Although the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to regulate commerce between the states, the court explained, Congress here had illegitimately used this power to ban child labor. Why was that exercise of constitutional power illegitimate? Because five justices said so. The law was invalidated, and the 8-year-olds went back to the mines.", "As Ian Millhiser illustrates in his trenchant, persuasive, and profoundly dispiriting book", ", the Supreme Court has consistently and unapologetically used its authority to thwart progress and perpetuate inequality. The child labor disaster is, if you can believe it, one of the less appalling stories in the book. For as long as the court has held the power to strike down laws\u2014a power it created\u2014its justices have used this authority to impose their own antiquated, antidemocratic ideas on the country at large. Millhiser repeatedly ponders why the court has so persistently hindered self-rule and social progress. The better question to ask about the court, however, is a more basic one: Why do we still put up with it?", "You wouldn\u2019t guess it from the confidence with which today\u2019s justices invalidate legislation, but it\u2019s actually not clear that the founders intended to give the Supreme Court final say over the Constitution\u2019s meaning. Sure,", "envisions \u201cone Supreme Court\u201d in which judicial power is vested, and", "makes the Constitution the \u201csupreme law of the land.\u201d But nowhere does the Constitution explicitly state that the Supreme Court gets to say, conclusively and with binding authority, how America\u2019s founding document can and cannot be applied.", ", the greatest decision of all time, had hardly any immediate effect on segregated schools.", "Given that ambiguous silence, shouldn\u2019t Congress, too, get to play some role in interpreting the Constitution\u2019s majestic generalities? When duly elected representatives of the people find that legislation grants \u201cdue process of law\u201d and \u201cequal protection,\u201d shouldn\u2019t that decision be accorded deference by nine unelected judges? And in a constitutional food fight between Congress and the court, shouldn\u2019t the democratic process win out over the labyrinthine legal doctrines dreamed up by lawyers?", "doesn\u2019t quite confront these questions head-on. Instead, Millhiser\u2014a former federal appeals court clerk and a writer for", "\u2014describes what happens when legislatures simply cede interpretive authority to a court swollen with power. The most galling portion of the book charts the court\u2019s perversion of a key component of the Constitution, due process. After the Civil War, Congress passed (and the states ratified) the", ", which stated in part that no state may deprive a person of \u201clife, liberty or property without due process of law.\u201d This clause had two functions. First, it forbade states from distorting the judicial system in order to deprive newly freed slaves of fair trials. Second, it barred states from enacting laws so deleterious to individual liberty, so contrary to fundamental rights, that they could not qualify as \u201claw\u201d at all.", "The due process clause, then, was obviously designed to protect personal freedom.

(Prior to this law, impoverished bakers were frequently forced to work 24-hour shifts in squalid, roach-infested conditions.) According to the court, this modest regulation violated the \u201cliberty\u201d of bakery owners to negotiate contracts with their employees\u2014and employees\u2019 \u201cliberty\u201d to work brutally long shifts\u2014without \u201cdue process of law.\u201d Under this preposterous theory, the court struck down", "and", "laws for the next 32 years.", "This era of antidemocratic judicial arrogance reached its peak in the early days of the New Deal, when conservative justices struck down legislation", ",", ", and", "for railway workers. Then, in 1937\u2014possibly in response to nationwide outcry\u2014the court pulled back from the brink, completely reversing course and abandoning its reactionary doctrines. Seventeen years later, the court handed down", ", striking a judicial blow against racial segregation and launching the golden years of the Warren Court. In short order, the newly liberal court issued rulings that vastly expanded the rights of the accused, the poor, and minorities. But this era turned out to be fleeting, and by the 1970s and \u201980s, the court\u2014stacked with Republican appointees\u2014relapsed into stinginess, once again depriving minorities and the poor of equal justice.", "How has the Supreme Court gotten away with so much bad behavior for so long? It has no army to enforce its rulings, no police force to ensure compliance. In pragmatic terms, there are probably three things that keep American law tethered to the court. First, most of us, especially those in government, simply feel like there\u2019s no other option but to follow the justices\u2019 orders. That\u2019s because the court has positioned itself at the pinnacle of American democracy, seizing a constitutional high ground and declaring its own decrees to be ironclad and incontestable. (The justices once", "that they were empowered to call \u201cthe contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division.\u201d)", "Second, some sizable number of legislators will usually agree with any given ruling and can push the government to conform to it, as when conservative state representatives", "the Supreme Court\u2019s invitation to reject Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.

Like Millhiser, I\u2019m starting to doubt it. The court\u2019s great liberal rulings arrived only after a majority of Americans already agreed that a certain constitutional right exists.

Its finest moments have merely crystallized an emerging public sentiment; its bravest rulings have been widely ignored; its worst decisions have devastated the lives of the less fortunate. There\u2019s essentially no rein on the court\u2019s power, no check on its ability to manipulate the law to the detriment of democracy and equality.

That\u2019ll be a sad fate for a briefly great institution\u2014but also a happy day for American democracy. At bottom, the Supreme Court exists to enforce the rule of law.
