To paraphrase the philosopher", ", they may not be the war novels we want, but they\u2019re the war novels we have. If they tell us little about the disaster that has been America's post-9/11 foreign policy, we learn much about how these wars changed our country and the soldiers tasked with fighting on our behalf. Above all, they speak to the vast disconnect between the lives of U.S. soldiers and those of us back at home, most of whom were able to live the last decade oblivious to the utter carnage wreaked upon Afghanistan and Iraq.", "Photograph by Thorne Anderson.", "American novelists tend to insulate their work from political concerns\u2014politics being one of those prickly subjects that neither plays well at a dinner party nor in fiction.

A fiftysomething debut novelist lauded for his first book, the story collection", ", Fountain seeds his novel with finely honed insights that reflect the hypocrisy and jingoistic thinking that dominate discussions about the country's wars. His sentences are head-shakingly good, and his indictment of America's military-media-entertainment complex is as subversive as it is convincing.", "The story mostly takes place over one day, when the young men of Bravo company are being feted at a Thanksgiving Day Dallas Cowboys game, the last leg of a victory tour ginned up after a bloody battle with Iraqi insurgents was filmed by an embedded Fox News camera crew and subsequently went viral.

He fails to seize on the absurd juxtapositions that erupt when a career soldier, engaged in a war of choice, is both cocooned from the devastating violence unleashed by his country's war machine and, indeed, tasked with spinning it for popular consumption.

The novel is a kind of fantasy, with most Fobbits wanting to avoid responsibility at all costs. Lt. Col. Harkleroad, Gooding's nose-bleeding commander, writes elaborate, fictitious letters to his Bible-thumping mother in which he paints himself as a hero.
