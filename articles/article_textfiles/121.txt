{"Body": ["Illustration by Rem Broo", "At one point in her extraordinary essay collection", ", Leslie Jamison mentions a phrase a boyfriend once used to characterize her\u2014a phrase by which, some years later, she still finds herself troubled. This phrase is \u201cwound dweller.\u201d She doesn\u2019t say much more about the insult, or its context, or why she has found herself dwelling so long on it. But she doesn\u2019t need to; the reference comes in the last of the book\u2019s 11 essays, and by this point it would be obvious to anyone who has read the previous 10 how cruelly accurate a description it is. Jamison is preoccupied with pain\u2014with her own pain and the pain of others, and with what it means, as a writer and as a person, to be so preoccupied.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "contains pieces on poverty tourism, on visiting prisoners, on the terror and violence of the Mexican narco wars, and on the ghoulish compulsions of the addiction-centered reality show", ". There is a superb piece in which Jamison attends a gathering of people who suffer, or feel that they suffer, from something called Morgellons Disease, a delusional condition whereby things\u2014often colored fibers or crystals or threads, and sometimes tiny living creatures\u2014are imagined to emerge through the skin from inside of the body. There is an essay on the West Memphis Three, who were wrongfully imprisoned in the 1990s for the supposed ritual murder of three young boys. There\u2019s a long essay-manifesto on the difficulties of writing about female suffering\u2014on the ease with which it can be dismissed as a clich\u00e9, and the necessity of doing so regardless. Running through all of this, stitching it together, is a strong thread of autobiographical narrative, which becomes a sort of artful self-portraiture of Jamison\u2019s own scarring\u2014from an abortion, from a violent mugging in Nicaragua, from a history of eating disorder and bodily self-harm.", "The go-to clich\u00e9 for this kind of writing, or this kind of subject matter, would be \u201cunflinching.\u201d That would be inaccurate in this case, because while there\u2019s certainly a relentlessness to Jamison\u2019s pursuit of the topic of pain, she does flinch. In fact, one of the more powerful aspects of her writing is the extent to which she is able to flinch while maintaining the steadiness of her gaze.", "It\u2019s in Jamison\u2019s hyper-conscious flinching from herself that the real work of writing takes place.", "In the title piece, which also opens the collection, she writes about her work as a medical actor, paid to play a character suffering from a specific cluster of maladies, in order for medical students to hone their diagnostic skills. The essay becomes an exploration of the idea of empathy, of feeling your way into the suffering of another person and identifying personally with their pain. But Jamison\u2014whose first book,", ", was a novel\u2014goes beyond the standard literary self-congratulations, about how empathy requires the same sorts of imaginative leaps as reading and writing fiction, and how", ". Instead she asks, in various ways, whether empathy might not in fact be less about the person being identified with than the person doing the identifying.", "Jamison seems, at certain points, on the verge of being creeped out by her own capacity for imaginative identification. She writes about her brother contracting Bell\u2019s palsy, a condition which causes partial facial paralysis similar to the effects of a stroke, and of how she found herself obsessed with imagining her way into his experience. \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling toward my brother,\u201d she writes, \u201cso much as I was feeling toward a version of myself\u2014a self that didn\u2019t exist but theoretically shared his misfortune. I wonder if my empathy has always been this, in every case: just a bout of hypothetical self-pity projected onto someone else. Is this ultimately just solipsism?\u201d", "Photo by Colleen Kinder", "She wants an empathy that arises out of courage, but understands the extent to which it is, for her, always rooted in fear. Imagining the pain of others means flinching from it as though it were our own, out of a frightened sense that it could become our own. She refers to psychological studies in which fMRI scans have observed how the same kind of brain activity is provoked by the observation of other\u2019s physical pain as by the experience of one\u2019s own. She says that she feels heartened by this instinctive identification, but wonders what it might finally be good for. Much of the intellectual charge of Jamison\u2019s writing comes from the sense that she is always looking for ways to examine her own reactions to things; no sooner has she come to some judgment or insight than she begins searching for a way to overturn it, or to deepen its complications. She flinches, and then she explores that flinch with a steady gaze.", "Jamison is fascinated by the porousness of the borders between herself and others, and by the way in which that porousness can permit the smuggling in of something like solipsism. It\u2019s rare, and quite thrilling, to encounter a writer who so elegantly incorporates her own writerly anxieties into her work, who is so composed and confident about the value of her own self-doubt. (In this sense, her writing often recalls the work of David Foster Wallace, one of many influences she openly engages with throughout the collection.) Here she is, for instance, on the peculiar way she finds herself identifying with a woman named Dawn she meets at the Morgellons gathering:", "This kind of ambivalence, this doubling back on her own assumptions, is what makes Jamison such a wonderful essayist. What feels especially vital in this passage is the intensity of her self-interrogations, the dramatization of the resistance against her own literary instincts. It\u2019s in the space of these interruptions, in this hyper-conscious flinching from herself, that the real work of writing takes place. When the inevitable happens, and she starts to suspect that she might herself be starting to suffer from Morgellons\u2014the delusional nature of which she feels makes it all the more treacherously communicable\u2014she tries not to think about whether she is itching. \u201cI am trying not to take my skin for granted,\u201d she writes; it\u2019s a striking claim, certainly, but one that seems strangely commensurate with her aversion to any sort of complacency. What\u2019s most fascinating about this essay is not the strange phantom illness itself, or even the way in which she keeps almost helplessly metaphorizing it (despite the tutelary spirit of Susan Sontag hovering above her, warning her against doing so); it\u2019s the literary virtue she makes of her own necessary difficulties with both.", "Writers, as Joan Didion remarked, are always selling someone out, and this is a reality of which Jamison seems always to be sharply aware. Her sense of the suffering of the people she\u2019s writing about here is so acute that you can feel her willing herself to believe in that suffering in the same way they do. She portrays these people with a keenly affecting clarity and compassion. At one point, she\u2019s sitting behind a man named Paul who has lost interest in the presentation taking place in the room, and is looking at photographs of his own wounds on his laptop\u2014injuries of scratching and picking and scraping\u2014observing the evidence of his own torment. \u201cEven here,\u201d she writes, \u201camong others who identify with the same malady, he retreats into the terrible privacy of his own broken body. He brings others\u2014strangers, briefly\u2014into this quiet battleground, but it\u2019s always just him again, eventually, drawn back into the cloister of his damage, that nearly unfathomable loneliness.\u201d At the end of the essay, she returns to Paul, to her own guilt at writing about him and his fellow sufferers:", "It\u2019s obvious that", "wasn\u2019t conceived from the beginning as a single book project. There are subcutaneous connections running throughout, though they seem to result more from an organizing cluster of obsessions than any kind of willful effort to make a major statement about empathy. One of the most enjoyably propulsive essays is \u201cThe Immortal Horizon,\u201d a report about an insanely grueling Tennessee ultramarathon and its affably sadistic ringmaster; although it is necessarily concerned with bodily pain and self-punishment, it\u2019s not especially concerned about pulling its thematic weight in the collection as a whole.", "Like Rebecca Solnit, whose writing these pieces", "sometimes recall, Jamison takes full advantage of the licenses extended to the essayist\u2014to create emotional affect through strange juxtapositions and connections, to generate meaning through long-range metaphors. Jamison\u2019s writing is often formally inventive, but never appears to be pursuing formal invention for its own sake; it\u2019s always a case, rather, of the material demanding some radical style of treatment, like a condition with no obvious cure. Jamison\u2019s essay \u201cMorphology of the Hit,\u201d for instance, could easily have been a schematic nightmare, but winds up being devastatingly effective. It\u2019s a short memoir about a time she spent in Nicaragua in her early 20s, during which she was mugged and savagely assaulted. The piece is modeled around the stringent formalism of Vladimir Propp, whose book", "isolated 31 plot elements, or \u201cfunctions,\u201d supposedly common to all Russian folklore. Jamison tries, and ultimately fails, to map out her experience along Propp\u2019s narrative coordinates. The essay\u2019s real brilliance is in its transcending its own cleverness through that failure. The problem of making sense of the experience, the nearly intractable difficulty of writing about it at all, becomes a vital part of that writing. \u201cThere is no function,\u201d she writes in the closing lines, \u201cdesignated for how this essay might begin to fill the lack or liquidate the misfortune\u2014replace the eyes, the heart, the daylight. Everything I find is stained by a certain residue: all that blood. My face will always remind me of a stranger. And I will never know his name.\u201d", "That phrase \u201cwound dweller\u201d haunts Jamison so abidingly, it seems, because of its suggestion of a perverse preoccupation with pain, an indecent lingering around the sites of injury. It was delivered, presumably, with the intention that it would cause its own complicated wound. And for days after reading this beautiful and punishing book, I found that I myself was haunted by the phrase, but for a different reason. There is a type of person, after all, whose job it is to linger around the sites of injuries, to observe the damage we do to ourselves and to each other. \u201cWound dweller,\u201d I realized, is an apt and troubling synonym for \u201cwriter.\u201d", "---", "by Leslie Jamison.
