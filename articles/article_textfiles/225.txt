{"Body": ["Illustration by MK Reed", "Michel Houellebecq\u2019s new novel", ", which describes an Islamicized France of the near future, has been described variously as \u201cmelancholic\u201d (", "), \u201cmelancholy\u201d (", "), and \u201cextraordinarily sad\u201d (", "). It is a \u201ctragedy\u201d (", "), one that ends on a \u201cbone-chilling\u201d note (also Lilla)\u2014the total capitulation of a decadent academic French elite to a pious and paternalistic Islamic regime. Melancholy is in the eye of the beholder. To people for whom the idea of \u201cEurope,\u201d or more specifically \u201cFrance,\u201d looms large\u2014with its spirited republican politics, its sectarian Christian warfare, its zesty", ", its Zola and Huysmans, its Drumont and Rimbaud and Corbi\u00e8re and Paulhan and Bloy\u2014", "may indeed be a pre-emptive bit of cultural mourning.", "Houellebecq is known for his eccentric novels, his desolate, sexually dysfunctional male protagonists, and his provocative pronouncements\u2014that he \u201c", ",\u201d for example, or that Islam is \u201c", "\u201d (he went to court over the latter remark). He is a writer who reliably issues his own brand of home truths. One of these is that women, as he once told an interviewer, \u201chave always been more interested in jam and curtains,\u201d whereas men are motivated ultimately by \u201clittle asses.\u201d These remarks have not kept him from the highest laurels; he won the Prix Goncourt in 2010.", "Houellebecq\u2019s status as a provocateur is so established it has become a kind of shorthand in talking about his work. Profiles and reviews often make passing reference to Houellebecq\u2019s reputation as a misogynist; lately, they don\u2019t seem to linger over it (Gopnik, Shatz, and Lilla don\u2019t mention the subject at all\u2014I went back to 2012, to the redoubtable", ", who pointed out that \u201cin Houellebecq\u2019s world, the unexplored vagina is not worth having.\u201d)", "Often, Houellebecq sets up a clear divide between his nearly uniformly awful narrators and himself. Take, for example, Bruno\u2014the racist, misogynist protagonist of his 1998 novel", "\u2014who drugs his squalling baby so that he can go carousing:", "Bruno is obviously a monster here. But elsewhere in Houellebecq\u2019s writing there is more slippage between author and character. There are moments of narrative authority in", "that urge us to take a statement as a true thing, a celebrated Houellebecq home truth: \u201cWithout beauty a girl is unhappy because she has missed her chance to be loved \u2026 it as if she were invisible\u2014no eyes follow her as she walks.\u201d Or here, a description of a classroom of young women, \u201ctheir faces already betraying a hint of dumb female resignation.\u201d", "In", ", Islam and Christianity find a way to compromise; as long as the members of the traditional French elite and state apparatus take the small step of converting to Islam, they may enjoy all the benefits thereof (the benefits as they have been enshrined in European fantasies, that is). It is the prospect of polygamy with very young women that eventually motivates the narrator Fran\u00e7ois\u2014a middle-age scholar of the novelist J.K. Huysmans\u2014to finally convert. In this new political configuration, women leave the workforce to cook and keep house. The older ones tend the hearth; the younger ones enliven the bedroom.", "This arrangement fits right in with Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 pre-existing view of the order of things. Of one colleague, he marvels early in the novel: \u201cI realized she had once been a woman\u2014that she still was a woman, in a sense\u2014and that once upon a time a man had felt desire for this squat, stumpy, almost froglike little thing.\u201d Of a former consort he observes, \u201cHer body had been damaged beyond repair. Her buttocks and breasts were no more than sacks of emaciated flesh, shrunken, flabby, and pendulous. She could no longer\u2014she could never again\u2014be considered an object of desire.\u201d Of another: \u201cSandra, who was plumper and jollier than Aur\u00e9lie, hadn\u2019t let herself go to the same degree. She was sad, very sad, and I knew her sorrow would overwhelm her in the end; like Aur\u00e9lie, she was nothing but a bird in an oil slick; but she had retained, if I can put it this way, a superior ability to flap her wings.\u201d It can always be argued that it\u2019s just the narrator, and not the author, who isn\u2019t a great guy; but the Evo-Psych 101 correlation of women\u2019s worth with their sexual viability that overwhelms in", "pervades Houellebecq\u2019s work.", "In an earlier", ", Houellebecq and his interlocutor discuss a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d moment in the novel. This is not one of the several examples of wrenching child abuse, but the death of a protagonist\u2019s girlfriend from uterine cancer. The character tries to get pregnant at 40, discovers the cancer, has a total hysterectomy, and eventually succumbs to the illness. Woman loses woman plumbing, misses out on evolutionary purpose, perishes. It was about as subtle as a rubber chicken. \u201cThe death of Michel\u2019s girlfriend was very moving, I think. I really wanted to get those kinds of scene right above all,\u201d Houellebecq told the interviewer.", "\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois is a sad sack of a figure, but Houellebecq cedes him the courtesy of intellectual curiosity, a body of work, a body of knowledge. Yes, he trades his French cultural patrimony\u2014something that presumably matters to Houellebecq, for all his purported disdain for the fruits of the Enlightenment\u2014for the promise of a stable of wives. But Houellebecq doesn\u2019t much seem to", "him for this choice. Houellebecq is certainly not some Ayaan Hirsi Ali, hammering Islam for its treatment of women.", "About", ", Houellebecq told the", ", \u201cCertainly a feminist is not likely to love this book. But I can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d This is a Houellebecq home truth, but a stale, ungenerous one\u2014one that does not extend the same consideration that many women have undoubtedly extended his work. Houellebecq\u2019s intelligence, his gnarled little sense of humor, and his style mitigate against a number of sins; there is something very interesting about his narrative experiments, something vigorous in his ostensibly monotone and unornamented writing (which is beautifully translated by Lorin Stein in", "). There is also something decisive about his social observations. Upon seeing his father with a flashy new vehicle, Fran\u00e7ois observes, \u201cThe whole thing left me profoundly shaken, since my father had always\u2014at least, as long as I knew anything about him\u2014been so rigidly, almost affectedly bourgeois in his good taste.\u201d Houellebecq can also be very funny. \u201cIn the end,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois quite seriously laments, \u201cmy dick was all I had.\u201d", "Photo by Philippe Matsas/Flammarion", "That said,", "might have been a more meaningful\u2014if no less provocative\u2014thought exercise had it engaged with Islam as something beyond a sterile surface upon which to project the twisted visage of France, or more accurately, of a few short but crowded centuries of French intellectual history. Houellebecq is quoted in a number of outlets as having begun the novel as a", "conversion tale; while the religion of revelation has changed, the preoccupations remain limited to the narrow confines of its narrator\u2019s worldview, limited to the cultural growing pains and death struggles of European philosophical and religious movements. Ben Abbes, the friendly Islamic politician who ushers in France\u2019s Islamic era, is revealed late in the book to favor an economic model called distributism\u2014an idea developed by English Catholic intellectuals at the turn of the century. The question of how Islam exists as its own cultural force that might figure into the sweep of history is limited here, essentially, to a clunky piece of exposition about Charles Martel and the Battle of Poitiers, which, along with the conquest of Constantinople and the attempted conquest of Vienna, is often trotted out as evidence of a long-standing clash of civilizations between the edifice of Islam and the edifice of the West.", "The substrate of France\u2019s economy and culture and political climate is its colonial past, and Houellebecq\u2019s books are full of Arab prostitutes, Tunisian grocers, hummus and couscous and sambousek and package tours to Tunisia and Benin and what his narrator calls \u201cFrench Africa.\u201d The colonial past is alive in his work\u2014Houellebecq was born on subaltern soil, for god\u2019s sake\u2014and I think he often winks at his crappy narrators enjoying the lingering fruits of empire. But these winks don\u2019t really enter into his assessment of French Islam, which is a shame, because they might have made the book\u2019s Islam less flat.", "I didn\u2019t expect to sit down to write this feeling quite so much rage.", "When the capital-C Culture outlets review", "and say nothing about its breathtaking misogyny\u2014when Houellebecq\u2019s misogyny is denoted by critics with a passing reference\u2014it seems to say: \u201cWe know, we know\u2014his gender politics are not great. But he has written a book that must be examined seriously against the backdrop of contemporary geopolitics, because he is a bold and irreverent social critic.\u201d The generous response to this elision is that there were other things to draw critics\u2019 attention. Just after", "was released in France, the attacks by terrorists on the", "office in Paris killed 12 people; this was the backdrop for the critical reception that followed the novel\u2019s initial release. The reviews I quoted above labored long over whether Houellebecq is Islamophobic\u2014typically alighting on \u201cno.\u201d But what happened the week that I read", ", in English, was that a", "after drowning with his brother and his mother on their way to Europe from Syria.", "Like the phrase \u201cJe suis Charlie,\u201d the image of the boy\u2019s small body on the shore will stay with people for a very long time. Houellebecq can pretend that his treatment of Islam is laudatory\u2014Islam as a protector of the cozy, bourgeois comfort that is missing in the life of today\u2019s male French intellectual. But his reviewers haven\u2019t read it as such\u2014they\u2019ve called it \u201cmelancholy\u201d and \u201cbone-chilling.\u201d And that reading props up the idea of cultural contamination\u2014the nativist hysteria that would keep overloaded refugee boats out at sea, that would leave families choking to death in abandoned trucks, that would kick the feet of small children out from under them, and pepper-spray them, and consign them to misery and death, because above all else the purported hegemony of European culture must be preserved against the ravening Muslim hordes.", "I think Houellebecq is smarter, and even kinder, than to harbor these views. But if we\u2019re going to talk about", ", we must also talk about", ". There is a way in which", "is not, strictly speaking, Islamophobic. But it does Aylan Kurdi no favors.", "I\u2019m a woman, so a collection of protuberances with a moldering hole between my legs. It\u2019s womanlike to mention the dead baby, to open the door for blame or conscience in art. I didn\u2019t expect to sit down to write this feeling quite so much rage. Oddly enough, I enjoyed", "\u2014which is elegantly written and thought-provoking and often strangely mesmerizing. Many people must constantly navigate the strange territory of engaging with art that hates them; there is a point, though, at which the avenues of connection close. What stayed with me about this novel was not Houellebecq\u2019s good style or his erudition, but his Orientalism, not just of Muslims, but of women en masse: \u201cA woman is human, obviously, but she represents a slightly different kind of humanity. She gives life a certain perfume of exoticism.\u201d", "Houellebecq concluded", "on a solemn note: \u201cAs the last members of this race are extinguished. \u2026 It is necessary that this tribute be made, if only once. This book is dedicated to mankind.\u201d", ", too, is dedicated to mankind, a small piece of it. And if this mankind undergoes a little reshuffling in its cultural referents, I found myself asking, in a manner befitting a Houellebecq hero, not \u201cWhat is to be done?\u201d but \u201cWho cares?\u201d", "---", "by Michel Houellebecq, Farrar, Straus and Giroux.", "Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.
