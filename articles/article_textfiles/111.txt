It is such a simple, plaintive statement, and one so revealing about the human condition in general, even though Straub is talking about a specific rudderless, disaffected Brooklynite\u2014a would-be carpenter who once played in a punk band with his now-wife, a real estate agent, and down-the-street neighbor, the proprietor of a hip locavore restaurant called Hyacinth. Andrew, Elizabeth, and Zoe met in college, where they formed Kitty\u2019s Mustache with another classmate, Lydia, who became an indie music idol after embarking on a solo career and overdosing at 27. Scornful, ambitious Lydia was the least talented of the group, and yet she had the foresight to buy the rights to the band\u2019s best song, a feminist anthem named for", "and famous for its rousing, self-defeating, and self-affirming chorus:", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "Here is Elizabeth composing \u201cMistress of Myself,\u201d back at Oberlin, her whole life streaming ahead of her like a mysterious wind: \u201cShe wrote the lyrics in her notebook in her small, orderly handwriting, the letters getting messier as she wrote faster and faster.\u201d It is just one of Straub\u2019s many beautiful evocations of breathless momentum, otherwise known as unstoppable time, and neither the messiness nor the acceleration seems accidental: Life, in", ", goes too quickly, and never as planned.", "When the novel opens, Elizabeth is walking the half block to her best friend Zoe\u2019s house. Zoe, effortlessly wild and glamorous, is married to the solid and unprepossessing Jane, a chef who resents Elizabeth for her close, not-entirely-platonic connection to Zoe; the pair also have a sardonic and charming asshole of a teenage daughter, Ruby. Andrew and Elizabeth have become parents too\u2014their sweet, straight-laced son, Harry, falls for Ruby while she is still on and off with a skateboarding ne\u2019er-do-well called (hilariously, given the book\u2019s temporal preoccupations, and the nonfuture he represents) Dust. The questions animating the book are pointed but universal: Can we stop the past from soaking into the present, and should we want to? What does growing up mean, anyway, and how is it done?", "Jennifer Bastian", "As in the best ensemble novels, much of the pleasure of", "comes from observing its affecting, palpable characters interact. Straub has so intricately and cleverly connected them that when she moves one, the whole chessboard reconfigures. Like a nosy neighbor, I could watch Ruby and Harry, Jane and Zoe, Zoe and Elizabeth, Elizabeth and Andrew fall in and out of love for hours, face pressed to the glass of Straub\u2019s wry, clear prose: Andrew and Harry are both \u201csoft on the inside, like underbaked cookies.\u201d A surgeon who is rarely at home reminds his family of \u201ca ghost who left expensive things lying around the house in an attempt to get you to solve his murder.\u201d", "There is much to praise, too, in Straub\u2019s renderings of twee Brooklyn, particularly a cultish meditation-and-kombucha commune that springs up, replete with lissome half-naked yogists and a toothy guru, to seduce Andrew. And Straub is shrewd about high school social dynamics: Harry \u201cdidn\u2019t vape or drink malt liquor, because there were other kids who did that and he wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d She\u2019s funny, especially in a gag involving a highly competent couples therapist who speaks in promiscuous metaphors. Straub can be suddenly, unbearably tender: After Andrew and his son fight, Harry remembers believing \u201cthat his father didn\u2019t sleep but instead just sat in a corner of a room, waiting to be played with, like the biggest toy in the house.\u201d", "As in the best ensemble novels, much of the pleasure of", "comes from observing its characters interact.", "What\u2019s more, Straub has a peculiar and gentle way of producing meaning, allowing characters\u2019 trains of thought to run freely until they end up exposing a truth at once personally significant and broadly aphoristic. The deepening feels so natural you hardly notice it happening, and then you wonder how you arrived at such an inward-facing, luminous place. At one point, Elizabeth (who loves Zoe, a little bit) starts to describe to Zoe how happy her son looked when he mentioned he\u2019d been spending time with Ruby, Zoe\u2019s daughter. But she stops. \u201cRuby, like Zoe,\u201d Straub writes, \u201chad a long life of adoration ahead of her, and Elizabeth didn\u2019t feel she needed to fuel the fire.\u201d The next few sentences track Elizabeth\u2019s evolving mental argument:", "The passage moves from Ruby and her mother, both aloof (their shared cool girl\u2013ness is the reason Elizabeth begins reflecting about childhood qualities that persist through time) to Elizabeth and Harry, both quiet and wistful. Elizabeth observes a pattern repeating in her friend\u2019s family before turning the lens on herself and her son, at the same time intuiting something about the way the two families relate to each other. She sees the multiple doublings, how whatever happens to the parent seems destined to recur for the child. She appears to feel guilt for what she\u2019s bequeathed Harry, even as she senses that to care for a kid often means to care for who you once were (especially if, like Elizabeth and Andrew, you are stuck in a twilit pseudo-youth). Yet she also appreciates the variations wrought by generations: It\u2019s hard to be a boy, but maybe in a different way than it is hard to be a girl. All of this unfurls so organically, with a fluent dreaminess, in sentences that whisper with suggestion rather than stomp around.", "Describing her characters\u2019 Brooklyn neighborhood, Straub wisely writes:", "This is a lovely insight about New York City made sharper by its salience to the story: Like places, people contain layers, their older selves laminating their younger selves and their kids\u2019 experiences overwriting their own. Andrew may not wish to \u201cfeel old,\u201d but perhaps he can settle for feeling both boyish and middle-aged at once, a composite of the people he has been, is, and will be. If none of Straub\u2019s characters act especially", "", "when confronting time\u2019s passage, at least they grow in awareness about the fluid and unpredictable run of their interconnected lives, edging ever closer to becoming the misters and mistresses of themselves.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
