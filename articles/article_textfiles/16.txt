Lee is seen more and more as a childlike recluse, when she is by all accounts a sophisticated presence, though certainly private. This we cannot reconcile. Rather than the plucky protagonist Scout, or the understanding and patient father and lawyer Atticus Finch, Lee gets treated as if she is her other memorable character, Boo Radley, who won\u2019t ever come out and play.

The reader becomes another neighbor, knowing much more of the story than Scout can tell us (or that we can reveal to her or otherwise ourselves). At the same time, we learn alongside Scout the mores and failings of Maycomb, Alabama, and the South with its lost causes and mysteries and maintained manners; the book invokes bravery almost as much as the N-word. It is to Lee\u2019s credit that I hardly had recalled the amount of racism thrown about by characters we might otherwise admire\u2014racism in the book is a form of confusion as much as anything, with Scout fighting her cousin who calls her lawyer father \u201ca nigger-lover\u201d though she doesn\u2019t quite know what he means.

(They shouldn\u2019t be merely financial.) But unlike Scout in the first novel, who must accept that verdicts are made by flawed humans, we have become less and less comfortable with the tensions found in the archive and novel form alike. In both a novel and the archive the writing starts out singular, usually done by one person, even if amid a community of others; yet the reading of an archive is always multiple.
