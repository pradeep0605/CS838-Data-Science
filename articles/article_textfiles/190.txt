{"Body": ["Illustration by Fumio Obata", "About halfway through", ", a collection of the 1995\u201396 correspondence between the writers Kathy Acker and McKenzie Wark, Acker writes, \u201cLife\u2019s too short not to be lived as fully as possible. Wonder what\u2019ll happen next?\u201d In Acker\u2019s case, a few months later, the cancer she thought she had beaten would return. In just over two years, she would be dead at the age of 50. But before that, she indeed lived as fully as possible, playing a role in almost every American cultural moment and movement of the last half of the 20", "century: from New Left political activism to conceptual art, punk to third-wave feminism.", "Abhorring limitations of all kinds, Acker exploded the borders between novel and poetry, philosophy and journalism, art and entertainment\u2014most interestingly, between reading and writing. She notoriously, brazenly plagiarized and reworked texts both classic (Cervantes, Propertius, Dickens, Faulkner) and exotic (Bataille,", ", Pierre Guyotat), collaging these with scraps of her own diaries, sexual fantasies, gossip, political screeds, and blunt analyses of capitalism, patriarchy, and linguistics. When she died in 1997, she\u2019d published", "", "", ", give or take; some of her books are so unclassifiable that the precise number\u2019s debatable. She was that rare, and now almost inconceivable thing: a celebrity experimental writer. Patti Smith with a post-doc, maybe; Anne Carson, if she\u2019d studied Greek during her breaks at a peep show.", "Patti Smith with a post-doc, maybe; Anne Carson, if she\u2019d studied Greek during her breaks at a peep show.", "Acker\u2019s plots, such as they are, hinge on rape, revolution, and doomed romance. She wrote obsessively and hyperbolically, about sex, gender politics, and the treachery of love, concerns that also consumed her everyday life. Raised in a reasonably prosperous but oppressive Upper East Side Jewish family, she cast her beginnings as equal parts", "and", ". In her early 20s, she famously worked in live sex shows in Times Square and stripped in sailor bars in San Diego. She appeared in a handful of arty", ". Her refusal of literary propriety extended to a refusal of conventional feminine identity. (\u201cThe only things that appall me are babies,\u201d she writes in", ") She was married twice, identified as queer, and went through a legion of bohemian lovers that included film theorists P. Adams Sitney and Peter Wollen; writer Rudy Wurlitzer; musicians Richard Hell and Peter Gordon (her second husband); artists Alan Sondheim and (reportedly) Sol LeWitt; Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer, the literary critic, philosopher, and founder of", ", the publisher of", ". Sex and writing, for Acker, were as inextricable as writing and reading, writing and politics. \u201cI\u2019m looking for what might be called a body language,\u201d she told her friend and occasional lover, R.U. Sirius", ". \u201cOne thing I do is stick a vibrator up my cunt and start writing\u2014writing from the point of orgasm and losing control of the language and seeing what that\u2019s like.\u201d", "She inspired both admiration and bewilderment, sometimes at the same time.", "as \u201cat once critically pretty interesting and artistically pretty crummy and actually no fun to read at all.\u201d Actually they can be pretty fun, and also funny, numbing, sexy, shocking, confusing, breathtaking, and monotonous. Especially for younger readers, Acker was an icon of liberation, giving permission to read, think, and write differently. She didn\u2019t write to entertain, or to tell stories, or out of the impulse we tediously call \u201cself-expression.\u201d Writing was far more serious than that for her, nothing less than a tool of survival and transformation. \u201cMy life was very, very dark,\u201d she told", "\u2019s", "Michael Silverblatt in 1992, \u201cand has gotten relatively lighter as the years have gone on. I changed myself by using literature.\u201d", "Acker emerged in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s,when cutting-edge American and English literature was briefly dominated by so-called transgressive fiction. In the", "in 1993, Silverblatt honed in on the hallmarks of the genre: a belief in the body as the locus of knowledge; a pervasive sexual anxiety; an obsession with abjection and dysfunction. Silverblatt lumped Acker in with provocateurs like Dennis Cooper, A.M. Homes, Bret Easton Ellis, Jeanette Winterson, and Lynne Tillman. While Acker, who was friends with a few of these writers, shared with them a certain sensibility and some formal concerns, her work had a singular intensity. Acker\u2019s essence was mutiny. The criminal and outlaw always beguiled her. In both life and work, she assumed their defiance.", "McKenzie Wark, an Australian media theorist and writer who", ", met Acker in Sydney in July 1995. She was 48, he 34, and he\u2019d just published his first book,", ". Both were involved with other people at the time, the bisexual Wark to a greater, more complicated, extent. The breathless, hastily composed letters in", "were mostly written over a period of a few weeks; their sexual and romantic relationship didn\u2019t last much longer. The collection comprises a tantalizing time capsule\u2014the letters touch on Acker\u2019s relationships with Lotringer and Sirius; contemporary films like", "and", "(both of which Acker says she adores); Portishead; writers like Judith Butler, Blanchot, and Bataille; hit TV show", "and a new one called", "; even the form of their correspondence itself, this weird and unfamiliar medium, email. Acker and Wark flirt, preen, dissemble, gossip, joke, analyze, reveal too much, reveal not enough.\u00a0Like pretty much every collection of private letters, it\u2019s simultaneously exhilarating, dull, and embarrassing. As Matias Viegener, Acker\u2019s literary executor and a writer and artist in his own right, suggests in his introduction, they\u2019re not so much love letters as mash notes, a chronicle less of a love affair than a mutual, short-lived seduction.", "It\u2019s a slim, curious collection but a revealing one. Both Acker and Wark quickly slip into roles that seem comfortable to them\u2014Acker, the foul-mouthed, big-brained, high-maintenance diva; Wark, an eager, earnest pupil dazzled by Acker\u2019s charisma and striving to assert his own. Both are big-time name-droppers: In one note, Acker recalls a visit to the Groucho Club with Neil Gaiman, while Wark talks about a meeting with the Australian prime minister. For the most part, Wark is cerebral and cool, even when discussing his own sexual orientation and messy love life. It\u2019s Acker who, characteristically, really lays her heart bare, most vividly in a longish email written drunkenly on Aug. 16, 1995, the sentiment of which can be summed up in these sentences: \u201cIf you don\u2019t discuss the rules, then the shit power games are outside the bed and they hurt. And I\u2019m truly no longer interested in either hurting or being hurt.\u201d Wark\u2019s emails lose a bit of their ardor at that point, the courtship seemingly curdled by Acker\u2019s compulsive self-exposure. When Acker writes, \u201cI love being wanted. I love being someone\u2019s object,\u201d Wark never really responds to this admission, choosing instead to focus on the books she\u2019d previously mentioned. In the early stages of her affairs, Acker tended to act, she said, like a geisha\u2014coquettish, solicitous. But like almost everyone, Acker was animated by contradiction, and that performance quickly gave way to a more demanding, needy, uncompromising side. Throughout her adult life, Acker always did exactly what she wanted, no matter the consequences. Most of her relationships did not last long.", "Years later, it\u2019s invigorating to see these details of Acker\u2019s real life. While Acker gave dozens of candid interviews in her lifetime, and returned relentlessly to her own biography in her fiction, she was also a resolute mythmaker, burnishing her legend with the determination of a Dylan. \u201cWe are all, to some extent, self-created,\u201d Lynne Tillman said to me in a conversation about Acker last fall, \u201cbut few created themselves as much as Kathy. Her need was great.\u201d At the point of these letters, however, the feral persona Acker had spent a lifetime cultivating had become a kind of prison. Acker\u2019s work always insists that the self is a mutable fiction, but she had been frozen into a very specific, and easily caricatured, image\u2014one no less troublesome for the fact that she herself constructed it. As she writes to Wark: \u201c\u2026 the KATHY ACKER that YOU WANT (as you put it), is another MICKEY MOUSE, you probably know her better than I do. It\u2019s media, Ken. It\u2019s not me.\u201d The \u201cme\u201d that Acker shows Wark in these letters is much more fragile and vulnerable. If Kathy Acker was a complex, colossal self-invention, what Acker ultimately reveals in these letters is how difficult, and lonely, that invention was.", "---", "by Kathy Acker and McKenzie Wark.
