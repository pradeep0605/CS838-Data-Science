It makes its canonization seem foreordained and minimizes its real historical importance. Truth is, it took a diffuse team of kindred spirits, many of whom never met Joyce in person, to bring this novel to the public, and quite a few more to ensure it stayed there. That\u2019s why, despite my reservations about another doorstop for the cause, Kevin Birmingham\u2019s new history,", ", deserves to be on any aspiring Bloomophile\u2019s shortlist of accompaniments. This is a deeply fun work of scholarship that rescues", "from the superlatives and academic battles that shroud its fundamental unruliness and humanity. Birmingham reminds us that this now-unquestioned \u201cgreatest novel\u201d required the help of lawyers, anarchists, and bootleggers to overcome a reputation for indecency so toxic that even E.M. Forster deemed it \u201ca simplification of the human character in the interests of hell.\u201d It\u2019s miraculous enough that", "was written in the first place, but its road to publication and widespread acceptance is lined with minor miracles as well.", "Image Courtesy of Penguin Press.", "Birmingham, a lecturer in History and Literature at Harvard, positions", "in two ways: as the rallying point for a gang of (mostly) American modernists, eager to force a new literature and mode of thought upon the world; and as a threat to anti-vice societies that originated in the Enlightenment and still held sway over the English-speaking world\u2019s popular culture in the aftermath of World War I. Joyce\u2019s own prodigious work isn\u2019t given short shrift\u2014this is as powerful a testament to his hard work and talent as any biography\u2014but it is positioned as just one element in the novel\u2019s ultimate fate and reception. What\u2019s more, Birmingham equates Joyce\u2019s artistic breakthroughs with the political ones that its publication demanded. \u201c", "removed all the barriers to art,\u201d Birmingham writes. \u201cIt demanded unfettered freedom of artistic form, style and content\u2014literary freedoms that were as deeply political as any speech protected by the first amendment.\u201d", "In its first half,", "proceeds as a two-pronged literary potboiler. On one side, Joyce tools away on his novel in Switzerland, Austria, and France, battling poverty and gruesome eye illness and always adding, ADDING,", "more observations and verbal details to its relatively simple narrative frame. In alternating chapters, the staff of the", ", an experimental literary magazine in New York, serializes the novel despite growing resistance from the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.", "Photo Courtesy of Penguin Press.", "The", "\u2019s publishers, Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, had already brought out a few wave-making issues of their magazine when an indefatigable Joyce booster, Ezra Pound", "essentially forced his way into their fold in 1916 and argued for the Irishman\u2019s inclusion. At the time, Pound was crusading for a purer, more representational literature he called Imagism. He was also close with John Quinn, a powerful and politically connected New York attorney who happened to be one of the world\u2019s foremost collectors of contemporary art and literature. Together, this quartet had a platform, an artistic mission, and a powerful benefactor. In 1918, when the first chapters of", "were sent in from Joyce\u2019s current home in Trieste, they suddenly had a cause as well.", "\u201cThe censorship troubles of", "\u2019 began not because vigilantes were searching for pornography but because government censors in the Post Office were searching for foreign spies, radicals, and anarchists,\u201d writes Birmingham, \u201cand it made no difference if they were political or philosophical or if they considered themselves artists.\u201d Anderson and Heap were fond of publishing feminist battle cries, as well as essays by the infamous militant anarchist Emma Goldman. Like Pound, they insisted that their aesthetic movement was also political, a means of upending the social order. The U.S. government agreed, and used the Post Office to clamp down on the", "by multiplying their shipping costs and eventually seizing copies.", ", however, wasn\u2019t a politically radical text. Instead, Joyce used an unapologetically forward-thinking brand of Imagism in service of the filthiest writing ever seen in a literary magazine to that point. Fancying his book \u201can epic of the human body,\u201d he filled it with every conceivable excretion and referenced a panoply of sex acts, from the mundane to the surreal. Moreover, its opening lines, a mock invocation of the Catholic mass over a shaving bowl, announced Joyce\u2019s intention to revel in heresy. Obscenity was the lifeblood of", ", the proof that it truly comprehended all human experience. \u201cTo artists like Joyce,\u201d Birmingham writes, \u201cwho considered free expression sacrosanct, censorship epitomized the tyranny of state power. \u2026 To publish a gratuitously obscene text\u2014to deny \u2018obscenity\u2019 as a legitimate category altogether\u2014was a way to expose and reject the arbitrary base of all state power. It was a form of literary anarchy.\u201d", "The novel was eventually published in 1922 by Shakespeare and Company, another literary institution (this one in Paris) run by a strong-willed American woman. Sylvia Beach had opened her store in 1919, and it quickly became the Lost Generation\u2019s literary locus, functioning as a library and mailing address for itinerant artists. Her version of", ", with its iconic blue cover and monolithic title font, was priced up to 10 times higher than the normal rate for a new book, but was nevertheless so popular that she had to remove a copy from her store window to prevent mob scenes. By that point the novel had become legendary, both politically and artistically. It was banned and burned by the U.S. Customs agency, bootlegged and distributed like a samizdat, and eventually defended by the publisher Bennett Cerf nearly a decade after it originally went to press.", "Cerf was a businessman above all. Having developed the Modern Library publishing house and then broadened it into the Random House empire, he knew that", "stood to sell well if it were actually allowed to. So in the early \u201930s he asked his lawyer, Morris Ernst, to essentially goad the federal government into suing him over it. They imported copies and alerted Customs that it was about to land on American shores, and, in one case, after agents missed a copy on its way off a ship, Cerf took the package to the Customs office himself and demanded that they open it and seize the contents.", "Ernst and Cerf\u2019s defense of", "hinged on its literary reputation rather than its purported immorality: They contested that a book of indisputable literary value could not, by definition, be considered indecent. Then they set out to prove the book\u2019s intellectual worth by rounding up scholars\u2019 opinions. This required the case\u2019s presiding judge, John Woolsey, to actually read the book in its entirety, not only the handpicked salacious selections that previous prosecutors had submitted as evidence. Birmingham\u2019s depiction of this undertaking is a marvelous bit of close-up narrative history. Equipped with the very kinds of books that I listed at the outset of this review (including Gilbert\u2019s), Woolsey took weeks to read the novel at home before the trial began, and struggled with its challenging syntax while arriving at a grudging respect for Joyce\u2019s accomplishment. Referring to the famous final section of the novel, told in the interior voice of Leopold Bloom\u2019s unfaithful wife, Molly, Woolsey acknowledged, \u201cit may represent the moods of a woman of that sort. That is what disturbs me. I seem to understand it.\u201d", "Molly\u2019s chapter\u2014\u201cPenelope\u201d by its Homeric classification\u2014was a centerpiece of the prosecution\u2019s argument. As she falls asleep next to her husband, Molly Bloom cycles through her relationship with Leopold and her affair with a brawny sleazeball-about-town named Blazes Boylan. The 40-page section contains only eight paragraphs and no punctuation, but it also contains bursts like this:", "This memory of a rapturous orgasm is just a drop in a flood of sensual recollections\u2014only lines earlier, Molly recalls the pain of nursing, the smell of dank men\u2019s bathrooms, and the bitter Dublin cold after a winter party. The lack of punctuation makes it all flow together, torrential and undifferentiated. It\u2019s an overwhelming reading experience, prurient at times but emotionally relentless. Any reader in search of smut would surely feel cheated, unless they\u2019re aroused by hundreds of impressionistic lines about a child\u2019s death (Bloom and Molly lost an 11-day-old son, Rudy), a military upbringing in Gibraltar, and conflicted feelings about femininity and marriage. The point of Molly\u2019s soliloquy, and the point of", "as a whole, is that the entirety of existence, even a seemingly inconsequential midsummer day, is suffused with just such an ocean of memories, emotions, and history. They crash together while we eat, shit, and have sex. They are the background for our every heartache and aimless walk. Even the plainest or most cast-off among us are worthy of", ", because our perceptions and feelings are as deep and immense as Odysseus\u2019s.", "Woolsey agreed. And for that reason alone there is, right now, in your nearest library or corporate bookstore, a 700-page journey that every serious reader should take at least once in their life. There are millions of scholarly words out there that might make the trip a little less confusing, but, having read quite a bit of them, I honestly can\u2019t think of a better argument for the book\u2019s greatness than the one that Morris Ernst teased out during the trial. \u201cYour honor,\u201d Birmingham quotes him as saying, \u201cwhile arguing to win this case I thought I was intent only on this book, but frankly, while pleading before you, I\u2019ve also been thinking about that ring around your tie, how your gown does not fit too well on your shoulders and the picture of John Marshall behind your bench.\u201d", "The judge seemed to grasp his point. \u201cI have listened as intently as I know how,\u201d Woolsey replied, \u201cbut I must confess that while listening to you I\u2019ve been thinking about the Hepplewhite chair behind you.\u201d", "\u201cThat, Judge,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cis the essence of", ".\u201d", "---", ", by Kevin Birmingham.
