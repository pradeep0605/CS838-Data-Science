{"Body": ["Illustration by Charlie Powell", "Does reading fiction make you a better, less self-absorbed person? You read because you are interested in the broad sweep of human experience, and because you want to gain access into the narrow sanctum of specific otherness\u2014to feel Anna Karenina\u2019s recklessness and desperation, or know the shape and weight of Ahab\u2019s obsession, and thereby something of humanity itself. But in order to make any headway with a novel, you need to grant yourself a leave of absence from human affairs, to sequester yourself in a place where you are sheltered from the demanding presence of other people. Opening a novel might be a kind of exposure to the world beyond the self, but it\u2019s one that necessarily involves a foreclosure against it too. A life spent reading is, among other things, a life spent alone.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "The idea that reading is an ethically salutary pursuit gets more appealing the more time you spend doing it. There\u2019s something basically reassuring about the notion that you might be a better person\u2014not just intellectually, but morally\u2014for having read a lot of literature. I\u2019ve just recently moved house, a large part of which undertaking involved the handling and sorting and packing and schlepping of books. As I took the books off the shelves and put them into cardboard boxes\u2014and again as I took them out of those boxes and put them back on shelves in a different house\u2014I found myself thinking about what all the time spent reading them added up to. A lot of these books I\u2019ve forgotten almost everything about; all that is left to me of", ", say, is a chubby Russian aristocrat in a dressing gown (was he even actually chubby?), and basically all I remember of Don DeLillo\u2019s", "is that it was about Lee Harvey Oswald and that it was brilliant. I found myself trying to quantify the residue of all this reading; what was it that it left behind, and how had it changed me, if at all? There was, surely, some cumulative effect, some way in which I could be said to be a better or wiser person for it. But all I could think, really, was: Christ, if all this reading has made me a better or wiser person, I\u2019d hate to think what kind of monster I\u2019d be without it.", "Earlier this month,", "which put forward evidence that social skills are improved by the reading of fiction\u2014and specifically the high-end stuff: the 19", "-century Russians, the European modernists, the contemporary prestige names. The experiment, conducted by psychologists Emanuele Castano and David Comer Kidd, found that the subjects who read extracts from literary novels, and then immediately afterward took tests measuring empathy, social perception, and emotional intelligence (looking at photos of people\u2019s eyes and guessing what emotions they might be going through), performed significantly better on the tests than other subjects who read serious nonfiction or genre fiction. Their basic finding was that reading literary fiction, and literary fiction alone, temporarily enhances what\u2019s known as Theory of Mind\u2014the ability to imagine and understand the mental states of others.", "The reaction to this was widespread and, as you\u2019d expect, overwhelmingly pleased. Louise Erdrich, whose novel", "was used as an example of literary fiction in the experiment, was quoted in the", "\u201cThis is why I love science,\u201d she said; the psychologists had \u201cfound a way to prove true the intangible benefits of literary fiction.\u201d Finally, science has given its approval to one of the literary world\u2019s most cherished ideas about the value of literature. Even though the study only measured extremely short-term benefits of exposure to small amounts of literary fiction, it was largely taken to stand for a wider truth about the morally improving effects of the stuff, the notion that it makes you a better, more empathic person.", "And this, obviously, is nothing new. Although the novel has, throughout its history, often been subject to a kind of self-reflexively ironic anxiety about the dangers of excessive investment in fiction (see", ",", ", and", "for further details), the consensus among writers has generally been that imagining ourselves into fictional minds and lives is something that increases our moral faculties\u2014a practice that grows our capacity for empathic engagement with the minds and lives of actually existing other humans. Our modern concept of empathy comes from the German term einf\u00fchlung, which means \u201cfeeling into,\u201d and it makes sense that we would associate this quality with the literary capacities of affective projection.", "Novelists have historically tended to be invested in the notion that narrative art can jolt us out of our selfish complacency and into a deeper sense of the experiences and sufferings of other people. George Eliot, in", ", wrote that \u201cthe greatest benefit we owe to the artist, whether painter, poet, or novelist, is the extension of our sympathies. Appeals founded on generalisations and statistics require a sympathy ready-made, a moral sentiment already in activity; but a picture of human life such as a great artist can give, surprises even the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is apart from themselves, which may be called the raw material of moral sentiment.\u201d And here\u2019s", ", if more pessimistic about the degree to which genuine connection is possible: \u201cWe all suffer alone in the real world. True empathy's impossible. But if a piece of fiction can allow us imaginatively to identify with a character's pain, we might then also more easily conceive of others identifying with their own. This is nourishing, redemptive; we become less alone inside. It might just be that simple.\u201d", "So this research is, in one sense, a pretty trivial reiteration of something that has long been taken as a basic article of faith by many people for whom literature is more than mere escapism. The important difference here, obviously, is that it is science that is telling us this about literature, and not literature itself\u2014and so the idea seems, rightly or wrongly, more like something you can take to the bank. But although I believe that literature is a huge and indispensable aspect of our humanity\u2014that books are, as Susan Sontag put it, nothing less than \u201ca way of being fully human\u201d\u2014I felt that there was something oddly diminishing, and perhaps even absurd, in the notion of bringing literature to account in this way. Of sitting people down and giving them a chunk of Chekhov to work their way through, and then measuring the short-term uptick in their ability to read people\u2019s facial expressions. (And does the ability to correctly read emotions from pictures of faces really translate into anything like real empathy? I can recognize that you are suffering, but not really feel that recognition act with any force upon myself, let alone lead me into doing anything about it.)", "I\u2019m equally ambivalent about the question of whether reading literary fiction really does make you a better person\u2014not just about what the answer might be, but whether the question itself is really a meaningful one to be asking at all. It implies a fairly narrow and reductive legitimation of reading. There\u2019s a risk of thinking about literature in a sort of morally instrumentalist way, whereby its value can be measured in terms of its capacity to improve us. There was a weirdly revealing quality, for instance, in the language that", ". \u201cReaders who emotionally\u00a0immerse themselves with written fiction for weeklong periods,\u201d David Wagner wrote, \u201ccan help boost their empathetic\u00a0skills [...] Gauging the participants'\u00a0empathetic\u00a0abilities and self-reported emotions before and after such reading sessions, they found that the fiction readers got more of an emotional workout than the nonfiction readers.\u201d It\u2019s possibly unfair to put too much pressure on one writer\u2019s choice of words in framing the discussion (particularly in a roundup blurb), but it hints at a certain view of literature that is implicit in this way of thinking about it\u2014literature as PX90 workout for the soul, as a cardio circuit for the bleeding heart.", "We have, I think, an anxiety about the place of literature in our world, about the usefulness of reading fiction. If we can answer the question of why we read with the empirically verifiable assertion that it makes us more socially attuned, then that seems to give literature an identifiable job to do, a useful function in our lives. Perhaps this is the case; perhaps reading Kafka or Woolf or Naipaul does make you a better, more empathic person. (Though what about your hardline literary misanthropes, by the way\u2014your Bernhards, your Houellebecqs, your C\u00e9lines? Do we gain anything in moral aptitude by reading these dreadful old bastards, and, if we don\u2019t, is doing so somehow less worthy of our time?) But even if it didn\u2019t, even if reading made you a worse person\u2014if you found yourself too engrossed in", "to take your bored children to the park\u2014reading would be no less vital an activity. I don\u2019t know whether all those boxes full of books have made me any kind of better person; I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ve made me kinder and more perceptive, or whether they\u2019ve made me more introspective and detached and self-absorbed. Most likely it\u2019s some combination of all these characteristic, perhaps canceling each other out. But I do know that I wouldn\u2019t want to be without those books or my having read them, and that their importance to me is mostly unrelated to any power they might have to make me a more considerate person.
