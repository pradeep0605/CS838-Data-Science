{"Body": ["Simon Roy", "A playwright in his mid-30s wants to pen an epic tale of ambition, authority, and power. He turns to his nation\u2019s history, to characters familiar to his audience from school and legend. He performs a kind of magic trick: shrinking his characters down to human size while also, by lending them his own considerable verbal gifts, enlarging them to mythic proportions.

Shakespeare went so far as to change the ages of his two Henrys to make the parallel sharper, and to have Hal\u2019s father openly wish, \u201cthat it could be proved/ That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged/ In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,\u201d so he could be Hotspur\u2019s father instead.", "What Hal knows, however, and Hotspur does not, is that \u201chonor\u201d is a kind of performance.

It is, rather, a public performance of masculine virtue. When the king upbraids his son for his party-boy ways, the substance of his scolding centers largely on critiquing Hal\u2019s performance in the role of heir to the throne. As Henry IV explains, back before he usurped Richard II and became king, \u201cBy being seldom seen, I could not stir/ But like a comet I was wondered at.\u201d Henry IV discusses himself in actor\u2019s terms, even discussing his regal bearing as a costume: \u201cAnd then I stole all courtesy from heaven/ And dressed myself in such humility/ That I did pluck allegiance from men\u2019s hearts.\u201d", "Often, this scene\u2014much like the", "in general\u2014is read as a step in Hal\u2019s transformation from feckless youth to virtuous king.

The show often underlines that Alexander\u2019s stated beliefs are convenient and self-serving.

Act 2, which explores the political maneuverings amongst Hamilton and his rivals in the early days of the Union, is less about his audacity and more about the ruthlessness of Alexander\u2019s particular brand of pragmatism.

Perhaps Shakespeare had more than a little of Alexander\u2019s chutzpah, or perhaps, for all our vaunted freedoms, we are voting with our dollars for the myths we need most.
