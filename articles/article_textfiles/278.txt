{"Body": ["Jordan Crane", "Athena Farrokhzad\u2019s", "opens in disdain\u2014an unforgiving assault on her immigrant mother\u2019s assimilationist ambitions. \u201cMy family arrived here in a Marxist tradition/ My mother immediately filled the house with Santa knick-knacks \u2026 My mother let bleach run through her syntax.\u201d By the end of the book\u2019s first page, her unforgiving has become unforgivably harsh: \u201cTo think that I sucked at those breasts/ To think that she put her barbarism in my mouth.\u201d The revulsion has a terrible intimacy to it, the speaker gesturing at her mother\u2019s aging body (\u201cthose breasts\u201d) in terms (\u201cbarbarism\u201d) that verge on ethnic slur\u2014all while she accuses her mother of pretending to whiteness.", "It seems, at that point, that this is a certain kind of book, one driven by a single speaker who will control the narrative and seek to explain herself by explaining how others have let her down. It\u2019s only after reading a few more pages that I realized the obvious-in-retrospect: The first page is actually the opening monologue in something that is both one-woman show and family drama\u2014and that the woman speaking onstage, with calculating lyric power, alone under the imaginary lights, is both announcing her intention to control the story and establishing a position the story won\u2019t support.", "After that first page, every statement in the book, save one, begins with a three-word phrase: \u201cMy mother said:\u201d \u201cMy father said:\u201d \u201cMy brother said:\u201d Eventually, five characters emerge, adding a grandmother and finally an uncle. The only one who doesn\u2019t speak (with one possible exception) is the narrator, who seems to be a version of Athena Farrokhzad herself. The mother\u2019s first statement, an apparent response to the opening monologue, chides, \u201cIt seems it has never occurred to you that is from your name that civilization descends.\u201d Both mother and father later say that she was born from her father\u2019s head.", "The characters speak with different perspectives but in a similar style, and in fact I tend to hear all the voices filtered through one voice, the one that insists on introducing them in relationship to herself. Though Farrokhzad\u2014who was born in Iran and raised in Sweden (she wrote the book in Swedish; it\u2019s been", ")\u2014is a playwright as well as a poet, translator, editor, and critic, and though", "(", "in Swedish) has been performed as a play in Sweden, it reads as a poem. All the family members talk brilliantly, but none show evidence of listening much, and only a few speeches seem to have been spoken consecutively. The statements feel didactic and aspire to aphorism, everyone competing for the right to define the world. The mother says \u201cAll families have their stories/ but for them to emerge requires someone/ with the will to disfigure.\u201d The uncle, who, like the father, seems to have been tortured for his political work before leaving Iran, says in his first line, as the book begins to enlarge its focus from the internals of the family drama,", "It\u2019s severely beautiful writing, but with a formality that doesn\u2019t invite response. It\u2019s also, I should probably mention, a misquote of sorts, as are all the quotations here. The page I\u2019ve taken it from actually looks like this:", "There are a lot of potential explanations for those boxes. The inversion of black and white is an obvious possibility in a book whose title foregrounds whiteness. (The Swedish title,", "actually repeats the word for \u201cwhite,\u201d \u201cvit,\u201d inside a play on words that could be read as something along the line \u201cjokewhite\u201d or \u201cwhitesuite\u201d or \u201cwhiteaftermath,\u201d the last one being the likely source of", "in English.) And the boxes clearly recall redacted texts, which have profound significance for both the repressive system that seems to have tortured members of Farrokhzad\u2019s family in Iran and the Western governments that have frequently tortured Muslims in the name of national security, as well as installing the corrupt government that the current Iranian regime deposed.", "But neither of these symbolic meanings feel especially resonant here. The strain of reading white text on a black background doesn\u2019t really upend my assumptions about my own whiteness. Nor does it help me experience the kind of strain an Iranian immigrant would feel in Sweden or the U.S. When I compare these boxes to the similar black bars in", "where I can feel and hear, as I read, the voices cutting off abruptly at the sharp edge of their erasure, the symbolism of those bars in", "seems more two dimensional, something not so much to be experienced as interpreted.", "Which is not to say that they don\u2019t alter the poem in valuable ways. As an experiment, I typed out a few pages with the same spacing but using black text on an all-white background, and then recreated the same text with the white text on black bars alongside it. Standardized, the poem sounds surprisingly different, more fluid and less brittle. It moves too fast to register", "\u2019s remarkable orchestration, its pacing, all those voices so hungry to be heard and so apparently unable to listen, except to revise what the other has said. Too fast to fully register Farrokhzad\u2019s presence at the book\u2019s blank center, orchestrating the voices, often against her own interests\u2014or, at least, the interests that drive the character of her in that one page where she speaks.", "The narrative details of", "are often elusive, and yet its dramatic power never wanes. Those voices, in their isolating intellect and beauty, their veering from lyrical figuration to academic formality, feel like they\u2019re trying to fill something harrowingly vast and empty\u2014the gap, for instance, between a brutal life in Iran and an alienating one in Sweden. One page begins, \u201cMy father said: \u201cYour brother shaved before his beard started to grow/ Your brother saw the terrorist\u2019s face in the mirror/ and wanted a flat iron for Christmas.\u201d That\u2019s followed with the brother, possibly older, saying: \u201cSome day I want to die in a country/ where people can pronounce my name.\u201d", "Khashayar Naderehvandi", "The only unattributed line after the first page sits alone at the bottom of a page: \u201cThe past is an assault never to be completed.\u201d It\u2019s likely spoken by the character of Farrokhzad, though because it too aspires to aphorism it also feels more encompassing than that. \u201cThe past\u201d gets way more attention from all the characters in the book than the white world outside their home in Sweden does. The characters seem to be competing in part for a claim on the authority the past confers, even as it remains brutally inscribed on them:", "Early on, the mother says \u201cFor a lifetime I envied your father\u2019s traumas/ until I realized that my own were far more remarkable\u201d Especially in the first half of the book, there\u2019s an implication that she is the most threatened by the power of the past, which denies her authority and which seems, at least in her mind, to have distracted the rest of the family from the work of the surviving in the present, which she had to shoulder alone, along with the family\u2019s disdain.", "\u201cYour father lived for the day of judgment,\u201d she complains. \u201cSo did your mother, but she was forced to other ambitions.\u201d You can hear the distancing, the way she too is making a character of herself, the way the work of justification keeps pressing the characters deeper into their confining, conflicting, roles. A little later, the father is quoted as having said, \u201cIf it were possible to compete in martyrdom/ your mother would do everything to lose.\u201d On top of everything else that line does, it uses \u201cmartyr\u201d in the more careless, figurative sense of someone long-suffering and overly dramatic, free for a moment from thoughts of the violent identity they fear their white neighbors will confer on them. On the very next page, the father\u2019s line about the brother appears: he \u201csaw the terrorist\u2019s face in the mirror.\u201d It\u2019s one of hundreds of small reminders of the ways the family members slip between insider and outsider in Sweden, decades after their arrival there.", "About halfway through", "shortly after the unattributed comment about the past\u2019s ongoing assault, the family members begin turning outward. They speak to Farrokhzad only in arguments with her attempt to tell their stories:", "As they try for authority over their own stories and words, the characters become more complex, finding space to move. In that movement they also grow harmonious, entering into choral arrangements wherein they pick up threads and themes and patterns from each other\u2019s speech:", "Another page offers the father and mother\u2019s voices syncing up with unusual ease. It reads, in its entirety:", "In all this enlarging, the mother in particular becomes more complex, less fully confined to her relationship with her daughter. At one point she advises, seemingly speaking to an audience larger than just Farrokhzad, \u201cIf you do not speak to someone for whom you can abandon language/ there is no point in speaking.\u201d", "Eventually, the father gives his sanction\u2014and his self\u2014to the book:", "It\u2019s a crushing submission, the parents\u2019 sacrifice for the future of their children becoming literal. In that light, it seems especially significant that Farrokhzad gives the book\u2019s last words to her brother, and that he turns his attention in those words to those with no opportunity to speak. Among a few other terms that recur throughout", "\u2014milk, dawn, dreams, burial, names\u2014language is both the most contested and the most pronounced. At one point, her brother instructs her in a problem that runs back through the post-Holocaust poetry of Paul Celan to, presumably, the earliest conquests among people with different words for the world:", "Poetry, Mallarm\u00e9 once claimed, must \u201cpurify the language of the tribe.\u201d And yet the best poetry never seems interested in purity, which is at best a pretense and at worst a worrying retreat into a smaller tribe. The characters in", "certainly hunger for something pure, some final word to heal them of their humiliations, but the book as a whole has no such illusions. It\u2019s a mess, phenomenally orchestrated, making of the broken past, both recent and remote, a record, fully embodied in language its characters distrust, of how much in our not-altogether-post-colonial moment still needs to be said and heard.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
