Thanks to media attention and a viral spread that attracted an audience beyond fans of North\u2019s popular", ", it became the most funded publishing project in Kickstarter history, surpassing its initial $20,000 goal by more than half a million dollars.

As the book arrives in backers\u2019 mailboxes this month, it\u2019s worth asking: Is it a good book? Is it $580,905 good?", "North certainly worked hard to make the campaign live up to every penny its backers spent. Kickstarter has no rules about what\u2019s done with money raised in excess of a project\u2019s initial goal, but rather than just sit on his extra cash, North began adding increasingly elaborate stretch goals to improve the book itself, as well as padding existing reward tiers with bonus goodies, and earmarking copies of the book for donation to schools and libraries. The book got full-color illustrations for each one of 110 death scenes, from a hand-picked roster of artists including", "creator Kate Beaton. Donors got a prequel (", "), a plush Yorick skull, and a multipronged bookmark to make it easier to backtrack through the text. (In", ", if not in life, you can decide that killing your stepdad wasn\u2019t such a great idea after all.)", "As the project total crept ever higher, North\u2019s promises grew increasingly breathless: When the Kickstarter reached $200,000, he said he\u2019d create a \u201cstage performance where the entire internet votes on what happens next\u201d; at $450,000 he promised to \u201ccreate a pizza that looks like Hamlet and\u2026 eat it?\u201d If the project hit $500,000, North said, he would \u201c", ".\u201d", "I contributed to the campaign because I admire North\u2019s work and thought the book sounded like fun. But thanks to North\u2019s voluble backer updates and creative reward tiers, being a part of his campaign didn\u2019t feel like simply preordering something, as Kickstarter so often does these days; nor did it have the faint whiff of desperation that often comes with artists asking their friends and family for money. This felt like being a part of the creative process, and having a front-row seat to an artist giddily realizing that his biggest dreams are now possible. In North\u2019s case those dreams just happened to involve dinosaurs, emo cannibal Hamlet, and a botched time-travel experiment that turns a major character into a trout.", "It should be clear from the above that", "ranges far afield of Shakespeare\u2019s original story. The book is nothing if not irreverent, full of jokes and digressions and profoundly silly plot twists. The reader chooses which character she\u2019d like to be\u2014Hamlet, Ophelia, or Hamlet\u2019s dad\u2014and then it\u2019s on to the familiar second-person CYOA format that provides readers such options as \u201cKill everyone in the royal court!\u201d; \u201cRe-read the book and make some new (maybe even better?) choices\u201d; \u201cGet mad at yourself for being such a screw-up, go back to bed, nap\u201d; or, simply, \u201cPARTY BOAT!!

For all its irreverence, though,", "\u2019s structure actually engages on a fairly high level with the play\u2019s questions about free will, decision-making, and actions and their consequences.", "In", "the Prince of Denmark has one of the most famous existential crises in literary history, as he ponders aloud whether suicide is worth the risk that whatever happens after death might be even worse than life itself. North\u2019s version puts the being vs. not-being decision square in the reader\u2019s hands, though it turns out choosing \u201cNot to Be: turn to page 17\u201d isn\u2019t much of an adventure at all: It leads to artist Mike Holmes\u2019 illustration of Hamlet chugging from a vial of poison, one pinky lifted genteelly, while Ophelia peeks from behind a curtain. There\u2019s no sign of the terrifying death-nightmares Hamlet\u2019s so worried about; just the words \u201cThe End.\u201d But even asking the reader to make the decision highlights how much of the original play\u2014and how much of life itself\u2014revolves around possibly crazy people bumbling through situations they barely understand, possessing a fraction of the information they need to get from one scene to the next.", "North provides all of Shakespeare\u2019s actual plot decisions\u2014marked in the book by small Yorick skulls\u2014and then allows the reader to second-guess the Bard by larding the book with hundreds of pages of invented storylines.
