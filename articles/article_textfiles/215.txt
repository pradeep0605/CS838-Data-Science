{"Body": ["Illustration by Andi Watson.", "From Sam Spade to Han Solo to Dr. Gregory House, a lot of our fictional heroes seem a little bit feline. They\u2019re grumpy, they\u2019re standoffish, they don\u2019t buy into the system, they do things their way, and they\u2019re pretty sure they\u2019re in charge even if no one else agrees. So as strange as the conceit of Robert Repino\u2019s post-apocalyptic detective novel", "initially seems, his loner hero comes to seem comfortably familiar as you read. Sebastian could easily have stepped out from the pages of Raymond Chandler \u2026 except that he\u2019s a cat who can walk on two legs and shoot a gun.", "House cat Sebastian\u2019s human owner-family is an unhappy one. The dad drinks, the mom is having an affair with a neighbor. Every time the mom sneaks her paramour over, he brings his dog Sheba, who quickly becomes Sebastian\u2019s first and only friend. Sebastian and Sheba\u2019s interspecies platonic romance plays out against a background of increasingly ominous news reports on their owners\u2019 TVs: whole cities in other parts of the world overrun by regular-sized ants, followed not long after by the appearance of extremely", "regular-sized ants who can walk on their hind legs and kill humans by the city-full.", "Any cat owner will recognize Mort(e)\u2019s steadfast refusal to ever do what any other character wants him to do.", "The \u201cChange\u201d happens to Sebastian just as the war arrives at his masters\u2019 doorstep. He awakens one morning to hear two paradigm-shifting sounds: gunfire in the near distance \u2026 and human language he can understand. Now walking upright, Sebastian stops his psychologically shattered master from turning his gun on his own family, and then stops a family of passing sentient stray cats from executing his (now former) owners. In the chaos of this global animal uprising, however, he\u2019s separated from his beloved Sheba. His quest to find her is cut short when he\u2019s taken prisoner by\u2014and eventually conscripted into\u2014the Red Sphinx, an anti-human insurgency squad led by an upgraded bobcat named Culdesac.", "It\u2019s with Red Sphinx under Culdesac that Sebastian discards the house-cat name given to him by his human masters and takes on the moniker of \u201cMort(e).\u201d The optional \u201ce\u201d in particular pleases him:", "Photo by Nicholas Repino", "It\u2019s also during his military service with Red Sphinx that the reborn Mort(e) learns from his geeky feline brother-in-arms Tiberius the real story behind his remarkable transformation. It\u2019s all due to the Colony, a subterranean hive-minded species of highly evolved ants, and in particular their giant Queen Hymenoptera, who has spent centuries underground developing the hormone that would transform the planet\u2019s animals\u2014and save Earth from the human race.", "So yes, as you\u2019ll have gathered, this novel is all kinds of crazy, but it wears its crazy so well. Repino maintains his deliriously deadpan confidence as he shifts", "from a war story to a detective story. After leaving Red Sphinx as an honored veteran and being given a cozy berth in his former master-family\u2019s abandoned house, Mort(e) can\u2019t settle into a comfortable postwar existence. Thoughts of his pre-Change canine friend still haunt him, thoughts that certainly aren\u2019t diminished when someone scrawls \u201cSHEBA IS ALIVE\u201d on the wall of his basement. As rumors spread of a human-engineered disease called EMSAH, and as Mort(e) starts getting visits and signals from Homo sapiens survivors who regard him as some sort of savior, our cat-tagonist goes rogue to seek the truth once and for all.", "Though the animals in this new regime are, by and large, glad to have shed the shackles of pet-hood, there are some elements of their former lives, flawed though they were, that they can\u2019t leave behind. Repino suggests that the main thing sentience offers these once domesticated animals is clarification of what they value most, what they cling to and prioritize as the world goes mad around them. For Mort(e)\u2019s partner, the pit bull Wawa, it\u2019s the feeling of belonging to a pack. For Mort(e), no new possibility of attachment can eclipse or even rival his first experience of intimacy with Sheba. He doesn\u2019t care about the Queen or the human remnants who oppose her. He just wants to see his friend again.", "It\u2019s a marvelously droll touch of Repino\u2019s that the sort of interspecies friendship that people love to forward and coo over on social media provides the emotional engine of his post-apocalyptic epic.

Indeed, a wonderful, low-key joke running throughout", "is how perfectly your average cat\u2019s regally aloof, non-people-pleasing persona dovetails with the loner-sleuth-who-stands-apart-from-the-corrupt-society archetype of hardboiled detectives like Spade or Philip Marlowe. Any cat owner who\u2019s wondered who\u2019s actually calling the shots in the family will recognize Mort(e)\u2019s steadfast refusal to ever do what any other character wants him to do or ever say what they want to hear. Ultimately Mort(e) can\u2019t play for any team\u2014the ants fthat want to perfect this world or the fanatic humans with their eyes on the next\u2014for very long, which makes him the perfect hero to observe both sides\u2014with the same baleful, dubious gaze I get when I try to persuade my cat to sit next to me on the couch.
