The same roiling passions that drive such young men have also fueled, Mishra argues, the rise of nationalist demagogues in India, Turkey, and Thailand. Most tellingly, the whole lot harkens back, with often eerie similarities, to the revolutionaries and revanchists that harrowed Europe in the 19", "and early 20", "centuries.", "This is a framework that pushes aside conventional, familiar divisions of left and right to focus on the profound sense of dislocation and alienation that spawned (and still spawns) movements ranging from fascism to anarchism to nihilism.

Not only is the rest of the world undergoing a bone-rattling allergic reaction to modernity, but America continues to reel from it as well.", "In", "\u2019s preface, Mishra explains that he started planning the book in 2014, \u201cafter Indian voters, including my own friends and relatives, elected Hindu nationalists to power.\u201d Growing up in what he describes as \u201csemi-rural parts of India, with parents whose own sensibilities seemed to have been decisively shaped by their upbringing in a pre-modern world of myth, religion and custom,\u201d he can attest to \u201cthe ruptures in lived experience and historical continuity, the emotional and psychological disorientations and the abrasion of nerves and sensibility that have made the passage to modernity so arduous for most people.\u201d", "Instead of experiencing themselves as enmeshed in a web of family and social traditions, obligations, and support (a web that, Mishra acknowledges, could be oppressive), people throughout the world have come to understand themselves as individuals endowed with rights, pursuing their own desires and advantages in a merciless, globalized competition with other individuals. This has been, Mishra claims, \u201ca massive and underappreciated shift worldwide.\u201d The modern individual is encouraged to aspire to the wealth, status, fame, and power on constant display via mass media, even when getting all of that means jettisoning other, older sources of meaning, leaving the places where their families have lived for generations and loosening once-sacred ties. More often than not, they will learn that the rewards of this system are reserved for a few, that the economic expansion of the past 200 years was more of a fluke than an abiding condition, and that emerging economies will never reap as much as the economies that got there first. The expectation that, as Mishra puts it, \u201cthe future would be materially superior to the present \u2026 nothing less than this sense of expectation, central to modern political and economic thinking, has gone missing today.\u201d", "On the other hand, even those who seem to have secured a leg up in the global rat race can turn vehemently against the modern dream. The ranks of ISIS have been fattened with recruits from Tunisia, \u201cthe most Westernized among Muslim societies,\u201d in Mishra\u2019s words, and there are British women, \u201cincluding high-achieving schoolgirls,\u201d who have willingly joined an organization that institutionalizes", "and rape. Westerners have produced explanations for Islamist militancy that consistently fail to account for whole swaths of the people who succumb to it. Some blame the religion itself, but most of the perpetrators of ISIS\u2019s terrorist attacks in Europe, for example, have not been particularly devout and have had no religious education. ISIS\u2019s success at recruiting educated young people from solidly middle-class families undermines the claim that it capitalizes on economic and political despair. The poor and the comfortable join up. Have-nots may be retaliating against a social order that invalidates them because it regards material success as the only marker of worth, but as Lily Tomlin once observed, even when you win the rat race, you\u2019re still a rat.", "Even those who seem to have secured a leg up in the global rat race can turn vehemently against the modern dream.", "There are two aspects to Mishra\u2019s argument. One is that the Western model of secular rationalism\u2014whether it takes the form of democratic capitalism or state socialism\u2014promises equality, opportunity, and dignity for all and then fails to deliver on that promise. The other is that the malaise of modernity afflicts even the privileged because the promise itself is hollow. A modern commercial and consumerist society is incapable of providing individuals with the sort of meaning derived from the traditional commitment to family, faith, and community that they sacrificed to chase after it. This second line of thought he traces all the way back to the 18", "-century Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who made such criticisms at the birth of the Enlightenment.

(Rousseau\u2019s notion of the ideal society was Sparta.)", "Mishra doesn\u2019t endorse this exasperating philosopher\u2019s vision, but he regards Rousseau\u2019s ability to anticipate \u201cthe moral and spiritual implications of the rise of an international commercial society\u201d as prescient. The philosopher foresaw, he writes, \u201cthe modern underdog with his aggravated sense of victimhood and demand for redemption.\u201d One consistent manifestation of this", "across many seemingly different ideologies is an insistence on the retrenchment of gender roles by angry men who feel emasculated by having to compete with, and sometimes lose to, women. Another is the rancor of provincials toward rootless cosmopolitans. Rousseau, \u201chistory\u2019s greatest militant lowbrow,\u201d felt like a bumptious arriviste in the Parisian society where Voltaire reigned. He mistrusted cities and professional intellectuals, and his ideological offspring would go on, in the 19", "century, to plant bombs in nightspots and to assassinate tsars, kings, and presidents. \u201cThen, as now,\u201d Mishra writes, \u201cthe sense of being humiliated by arrogant and deceptive elites was widespread, cutting across national, religious and racial lines.\u201d", "One of the problems, of course is \"equality of opportunity\" is a flawed concept. We all have different opportunities based on many things, the family/society you're born into, your health profile, your innate intelligence level, to name just a few.", "", "", "", "", "is a short book into which a lot of intellectual history has been packed. Apart from Rousseau and a few other major figures such as Nietzsche, Mishra writes, he has chosen to focus on \u201crelatively neglected German, Russian, and Italian thinkers, whose eclectic ideas infused other frustrated latecomers to modernity with a messianic sense of destiny.\u201d (He opens the book with the Italian poet Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio who, in 1919, with the aid of a couple thousand followers, took over the town of Fiume for more than a year, establishing a proto-fascist \u201cfree state\u201d and inventing the stiff-arm salute now associated with the Nazis.) The middle of the book could be heavy sledding for anyone lacking a passing familiarity with figures such as Fichte, Bakunin, and Kropotkin, but the chapters on how these European writers affected subsequent generations of leaders in India, Turkey, and China make it worth the effort.
