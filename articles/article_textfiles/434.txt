A birthday gift from my wife, the ball bears the 1982 World Series logo and was signed, at some point between then and now, by Robin Yount, the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 star shortstop and that season\u2019s AL Most Valuable Player. The T in his signature resembles a star.", "I\u2019ve got a patchy memory that some weeks after the Brewers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1982 series, my grandfather took me to a breakfast sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, or maybe the Lions Club. I don\u2019t remember whether my grandfather cared all that much about baseball, but I think we went because my father\u2014his son\u2014had died as the season was just getting underway and my family was trying to treat us kids to special events when they could. This qualified. The Brewers were all there\u2014Molitor, Cooper, Gantner, Oglivie, Fingers, Yount, of course\u2014and I left with a baseball signed by the whole team.", "One summer day some years later, a neighbor and I were playing a game we called \u201cKirby Puckett,\u201d which had us leaping up against an imaginary centerfield wall to make miracle catches, just the way", ". (Playing \u201cRobin Yount\u201d involved", ".) The ball we were using got away, as the ball we were using often did\u2014only this time it rolled across my front lawn and into a drain. When I emerged from the house with my autographed ball, we each promised the other it would never hit the ground. We\u2019d catch every toss.", "In his new book,", ", John Sexton, president of New York University (where, full disclosure, he and I both teach), includes a similar story by essayist Leonard Kriegel. Stricken with polio as a child, Kriegel was once presented, while in the hospital, with a ball signed by the 1945 Detroit Tigers. In his own writing Kriegel recalls, \u201cThat ball simply embodied the idea of physical grace\u2014a grace that had been ripped from my life by the virus.\u201d", "Time passed. And one day, Sexton recounts, while playing catch \u201cthe ancient ball they were using simply fell apart,\u201d and Kriegel and a friend had reason to fetch that Tigers ball from the house. I imagine them making promises to catch every toss. And yet: \u201cOne by one, the names on the ball disappeared, chalked and cut and scuffed into oblivion by granite and brick and creosote.\u201d", "That is what happened to my Brewers ball too, of course. No one catches every toss. Fathers die. So do sons. Children are afflicted. Still, Kriegel can say about that ball: \u201cFor one last time, it had rescued me from a bad day.\u201d", "This is baseball to John Sexton. Grace and affliction. Miracles and doubt. Belief and joy and ecstasy, too. In his book Sexton argues that there are moments in the game that lift us out of our regular existence: rescuing us, say, from another bad day; granting us an experience, in the words of one theologian, of \u201c\u2018standing outside of oneself\u2019\u2014without ceasing to be oneself\u201d (the textbook definition of ecstasy).", "Now, it needn\u2019t be baseball, Sexton is clear to point out, that takes us out of ourselves. Organized religion can sometimes work. So might music or art. But Sexton\u2019s hope, in chapters that follow the innings 1 through 9\u2014with room set aside, as well, for a pregame show, a seventh-inning stretch, and a return to the clubhouse\u2014is to reveal that this game can evoke the very \u201cessence of religion,\u201d that \u201cinside the game the formative material of spirituality can be found.\u201d", "In baseball, time passes more slowly than in the real world, Sexton notes, and without a clock to regulate the game it could go on forever. This slowness and, with it, a suggestion of eternity, trains us to see the world more fully and with more care. And this feels true\u2014the slowness, at least\u2014until you look back and realize no game ever has gone on forever. Or, until you recall with a sense of deepening nostalgia, as Sexton does, the days when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn, which makes you realize just how quickly time actually goes. The Dodgers have been in Los Angeles for more than half a century\u2014long enough to allow for Sexton\u2019s conversion to the Yankees. My Brewers have played in the National League for almost 15 years now. Yount\u2019s been on the shelf for nearly 20. Yet, somehow, every game is still a break from that time speeding by.", "Photo by NYU Photo Bureau Madere", "Each spring for more than a decade, as if in anticipation of the upcoming baseball season, Sexton has offered an undergraduate course, also called", "(The book is co-authored by Thomas Oliphant and Peter J. Schwartz, friends and colleagues of Sexton who both have long connections with the course. Oliphant\u2019s best-selling", "has been included on the syllabus over the years. Schwartz was the first student ever enrolled in the course.) This class and the book both rely on two terms of art from Sexton\u2019s earlier days in religious studies to pave the road between baseball and the divine. The first is", ", \u201cindescribable in words yet \u2026 palpable and real.\u201d The second is", ", a term borrowed from", ", which means \u201ca manifestation of the sacred or holy.\u201d And to bring these terms together, Sexton takes us to Yankee Stadium. The date: Oct. 4, 1955. The Dodgers\u2019 shortstop Pee Wee Reese tosses a low ball across the diamond, and first baseman Gil Hodges catches it. Game over.", "\u201cIn the basement of my family\u2019s home, my friend Bobby \u2018Dougie\u2019 Douglass and I knelt and prayed with all the intensity we could muster, grasping between us in dynamic tension each end of a twelve-inch crucifix we had removed from the wall. \u2026 We prayed before a radio instead of an altar, which broadcast the sounds of Game Seven of the 1955 World Series instead of hymns. \u2026 For three innings, time had slowed; but in that moment it froze: The Brooklyn Dodgers had won the World Series! Seven decades of waiting were over! Dougie raised his arms in exultation, releasing the crucifix, whereupon the laws of physics drove the head of Christ into my mouth, chipping my front tooth. I wore that chipped tooth, unrepaired, as a visible memento for nearly fifty years.\u201d", "\u201cOctober 4, 1955,\u201d Sexton concludes. \u201cFor me and millions of others, a sacred day. Why? Hard to put into words. Impossible to capture completely in our limited vocabulary.\u201d One catch by a first baseman who throughout a season may catch hundreds and hundreds of tosses across the diamond, who in a career gloves thousands of outs\u2014this catch is a hierophany. Without it, the day might just have fallen into the realm of the profane, easy to capture with available words: Another Dodgers loss. Another season lost. Wait \u2019til next year. What makes it ineffable\u2014for Sexton and those millions of others\u2014is the wonder and joy, the miracle at long last, of a Brooklyn win.", "Sexton\u2019s writing is not always up to the likes of Whitman or Updike or Bernard Malamud, some of his favorites whose writings on baseball make appearances in the book. There\u2019s nothing from Sexton in", "that\u2019s as moving, say, as this, from onetime Yale president and former commissioner of the major leagues, A. Bartlett Giamatti:", "\u201cBaseball is about going home, and how hard it is to get there and how driven is our need. It tells us how good home is. Its wisdom says you can go home again but that you cannot stay. The journey must always start once more, the bat an oar over the shoulder, until there is an end to all journeying.", "; the going home; the game of nostalgia, so apt an image for our hunger that it hurts.\u201d", "And where God is concerned, Sexton\u2019s not quite", "or", "or", ", the theological stalwarts he\u2019s been raised on and the non-doctrinaire believers he most believes in. But the God they describe\u2014always the indescribable one\u2014is the one at the center of the book and his course. Here\u2019s Tillich, for instance: \u201cThe name of this infinite and inexhaustible depth and ground of all being is", ". That depth is what", "means. And if that word has not much meaning for you, translate it, and speak of the depths of your life, of the source of your being, of your ultimate concern, of what you take seriously without reservation.\u201d And here\u2019s Heschel: \u201cBy the ineffable we mean that aspect of reality, which by its very nature lies beyond our comprehension and is acknowledged by the mind to be beyond the scope of the mind\u201d\u2014a thought that Sexton follows with: \u201cLike what Dougie and I experienced that day in 1955 when the ball landed in Hodges\u2019s glove.\u201d", "I think it\u2019s worth taking a moment to acknowledge that a grown man with an autographed baseball hanging on his wall is probably more inclined than non-fans to find Sexton\u2019s argument worthwhile. Yet what\u2019s most striking about Sexton\u2019s book is its reminder of just how rare it has become for a professor\u2014or a teacher of any sort, even a religious one\u2014to ask a student to go with him on a journey into the depths of a life or the source of being. The notion that we might take anything seriously without reservation is not one that tends to get much play, in my experience, even in Religion or English 101. But Sexton\u2014teaching sophomores and juniors and now writing for readers of all ages\u2014is a true believer. It isn\u2019t doctrine he\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s not rote prayer. Sexton believes in the language we use\u2014and the ways that language fails us\u2014when describing what concerns us most. He believes there\u2019s more to existence than what we can say. And he believes it\u2019s worthwhile to remind young people, especially, of this, to advise them to slow down in the way baseball slows its fans down, and find ways to see more in life, to see more intensely. Our lives are never slow for long, yet baseball, Sexton says, \u201ccalls us to live slow and notice.\u201d", "Play a game. Play in the street. Scuff a ball. Go for breakfast when your team loses. Long for home. And be rescued by baseball from one more bad day. It\u2019s a generously long season. Our long winter is nearly done. We\u2019ve all got a lot to look forward to. So live slow.
