{"Body": ["Photo by Ted Allan. Image courtesy of MGM.", "This sentence was written in a personal letter by Groucho Marx to his frenemy, T.S. Eliot. Groucho had dropped out of elementary school, and for the rest of his life strove to prove himself a man of letters, as well as to discredit men of letters. In both his private and public humor he relied heavily on words, yet had a knack for exposing all words as ultimately contentless. Hence his desire to have Eliot read his autobiography\u2014thereby legitimizing it\u2014as well as his need to deflate the great poet into an impotent man with a \u201csexy mood,\u201d but no recent sexual activity.", "This account of Groucho\u2019s correspondence with Eliot is among a number of revealing scenes in Lee Siegel\u2019s", ", and as the book is a critical biography, all such scenes are in service of a literary and philosophical analysis. This is what explicitly distinguishes this book from previous Marx biographies: In Siegel\u2019s hands, the details of Groucho\u2019s life are less interesting than the broader literary argument that they illustrate, which Groucho would have found both deeply validating and kind of annoying. To any literarily or philosophically inclined Groucho fan, however, the book is a luminous delight.", "is in itself a kind of funny title. Not only does it feature the scientifically funny hard-C sound, but it\u2019s also deeply pretentious. And pretentiousness, being a form of ego-inflation, is among comedy\u2019s most reliable targets. So it\u2019s a self-defeating title: a reader who understands the comedy of existence would also make fun of the phrase \u201cthe comedy of existence.\u201d Inspired paradox is at the heart of Siegel\u2019s understanding of Groucho. He argues that the Marx Brothers\u2019 comedy seeks to destroy everything, including the possibility of comedy itself. \u201cWell, all the jokes can\u2019t be good,\u201d says Groucho in", ". \u201cYou\u2019ve got to expect that once in a while.\u201d", "Siegel observes that the Brothers routinely let loose streams of cascading puns, malapropisms, word associations, and seemingly pointless slapstick that are perplexingly bad and often aggressively anti-comedic, but taken collectively become", ", and thereby hilarious. In the words of the 1930s film critic Otis Ferguson: \u201cYou realize while wiping your eyes well into the second handkerchief that it is nothing so much as a hodgepodge of skylarking.\u201d But as Siegel explains, when the bad jokes relentlessly pile on, they reduce \u201clanguage to sounds, intellectual life to disorder, and emotional life to physical gestures.\u201d In the wake of this nihilistic force, our only physical response can be laughter. The Marx Brothers\u2019 humor therefore exists \u201con the threshold of first and last things\u2014that is to say, philosophy.\u201d", "When Groucho", "Harpo in", "he asks him who he is, and Harpo answers by rolling up his sleeve and revealing a tattooed image of his own face. This answer transforms Groucho\u2019s social request for an introduction into a fundamental philosophical question: Can we ever pinpoint a person\u2019s true identity? It also asks an even more fundamental question about representation in language: How can we point to something in the world with complete accuracy, without also being meaninglessly redundant? Harpo\u2019s answer to \u201cwho are you?\u201d is a visual-gag version of the Buddha\u2019s infuriatingly honest answer to the same question. When asked who he was, he would say, gesturing to himself: I am", "(the one who is like this).", "When people talk about comedians as philosophers, they often mention George Carlin, Sam Kinison, or Louis C.K. These are comics whose jokes contain broader wisdom about human nature, society, language, and sometimes the humor of", ". These comedians are people with Something to Say. But Groucho doesn\u2019t have anything to say. (And Harpo, for that matter, has literally nothing to say.) For Groucho it is the aggressive lack of agenda that makes him more than just a philosopher\u2014that makes him a living philosophical force, a human argument against any attempt to make meaning of anything or stand for something. The refrain of his introductory song in", ": \u201cWhatever it is,", ".\u201d At the same time, standing for nothing also lets him stand for anything: \u201cThose are my principles, and if you don\u2019t like them ... well, I have others.\u201d", "If this essay feels more like a philosophical treatise than a book review, that\u2019s because Siegel\u2019s book reads more like a philosophical treatise than a biography. And yet Siegel somehow manages to make this treatise a true page-turner and a lot of fun. He applies his own philosophical acuity to the personal and socio-political aspects of Groucho\u2019s life. He exposes the paradox behind Groucho\u2019s misogyny, without excusing it\u2014Siegel points out that there is a conscious impotence in Groucho\u2019s repeated insults of women, on-screen and off: \u201cHe makes certain that it is an expression of male weakness, not male strength.\u201d Siegel\u2019s theory is that Groucho\u2019s attitude toward women was a symptom of early 20", "-century Jewish humor, and a result of being personally frustrated with a weak father who was prone to theatrical expressions of authority and bravado.", "Image by Christina Gillham", "Siegel\u2019s understanding of Groucho\u2019s Jewishness is layered with useful complexity. (This book is part of Yale University Press\u2019", "series.) He provides a close reading of Groucho\u2019s famous line: \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member.\u201d Groucho used this line in a telegram he sent to resign from an actual high-brow social club to which he felt superior. Siegel reads the line as equally self-annihilating and triumphant. So Groucho is an example of an early 20", "-century Jew asserting dominance over American society by making his role as a permanent outsider part of mainstream American culture.", "Siegel sees a philosophical paradox in every facet of Groucho\u2019s life and art. Interestingly enough, the one issue on which the book is consistently ambivalent about is whether we can call the Marx Brothers \u201cfunny.\u201d I don\u2019t think this is so much a critical oversight on Siegel\u2019s part as it is a testament to the Marx Brothers\u2019 genius, as well as proof for Siegel\u2019s argument that the Marx Brothers\u2019 comedy destroys everything, including comedy. Siegel provides multiple arguments for how the Brothers are \u201csomething more or less than funny,\u201d or \u201ctoo nihilistic for laughter.\u201d But at the same time he repeatedly refers to them as \u201cfunny,\u201d too. There is a missing argumentative step that the book seems afraid to articulate, maybe because it\u2019s self-contradictory: that this comedy, which goes too far past comedy into pure nihilism, still works as comedy, and that this in itself is funny.", "Because when the chips are down, the balloon goes up, and there is no hope the sun will ever shine again, you laugh.", "", "", "", "", "Siegel offers extended analysis about how, in its essence, their work is not comedic.
