The list\u2014from infancy to adulthood, from head to toe, inside and out\u2014is extensive. Broder started experiencing symptoms of an anxiety disorder at age 12, but the trouble really started before that, she claims. The doctor who delivered her told her mother that newborn Broder was pretty, and she writes that instead of accepting the compliment, she spent the rest of her life measuring herself against it and losing. The other babies were hotter, her low self-esteem and early-onset anxiety led her to stress-gorge on milk, and before long she let herself go completely, eating her own snot behind a \u201chandshield\u201d despite judging looks from her schoolmates at story hour. Broder continued to nurture a destructive relationship with consumption: She binge-ate as a child, developed an eating disorder as a teen, and ingested mass quantities of drugs and alcohol in college. After she got sober at 25, she still sought constant fulfillment from softer addictions such as Twitter likes and the online dating apps that fuel her unrealistic romantic fantasies. This endless need to fill herself and seek validation, Broder argues, is a natural response to being born. It is unethical and absurd to her that people are brought into the world without their consent.", "Broder\u2019s heightened morbidity is at once wise and inseparable from her mental illness. She suffers from depression and debilitating panic attacks that make the world appear hyperreal: People are nightmarish, plastic; violent death is imminent.

While Broder aligns herself with and agonizes over distinctly female issues, her gendered angst and healthy righteousness routinely collapse into the extremities of her mercurial mental state. She feels judged by men but also, inexplicably, by the universe at large: \u201cI feel like plants, babies, trees, the ocean, animals, and the moon don\u2019t like me.\u201d Broder, who takes an SSRI to manage her panic attacks, has also sought solace in irony\u2014mocking the way that her spirits latch onto any personal, worldly, or philosophical worry and plunge sharply downward.

Broder wasn\u2019t too sold on the archangel the shaman enlisted to exorcise evil spirits, but the shaman also told Broder that her panic attacks could arise from depression. She continued to take antidepressants and see her therapist, but she also began noticing that in her hyperbolic worrying, she was trying to dam an \u201cocean of sadness\u201d inside her. \u201cI always imagined that something was supposed to rescue me from the ocean,\u201d she says. \u201cBut maybe the ocean is its own ultimate rescue\u2014a reprieve from the linear mind and into the world of feeling.\u201d She resolved to jump in.

Lauren once had a panic attack so severe that she made up an excuse for her and her patient to get some air and grab something to eat. \u201cShe cloaked this exodus in teaching the patient a lesson in self-care,\u201d Broder writes. \u201c", ", she said.
