{"Body": ["Illustration by Isabel Greenberg.

(My Latin is a little rough, but", "basically translates as \u201cclever man.\u201d) We see ourselves largely in terms of our knowing; our place in the natural order of things is at the top, as the ones who have it figured out. And it\u2019s pretty obvious, too, that it was a biologist who got to do this naming because the name reflects our conception of ourselves as knowers and understanders of the world\u2014as scientists by nature. There\u2019s another way of thinking about what defines us, though, that is just as reflective of our essential qualities: We are creatures of narrative, makers and consumers of stories. And the things we don\u2019t understand about the world and our place in it\u2014the areas that remain dark to our scientific sapience\u2014have always provided fertile territory for that narrative inventiveness. We understand the world by making it up. \u201cWe tell ourselves stories in order to live,\u201d as Joan Didion famously put it; we\u2019re a species of Scheherazades, narrating for our lives.", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "The presence of Scheherazade\u2019s tutelary spirit is one you feel throughout Isabel Greenberg\u2019s", ", an inventive graphic novel about the telling of stories, about making things up and staying alive. Although the whole thing is held together by a simple framing narrative (a story about a storyteller who sets off in search of a missing piece of his soul), the main substance of the book is in its diversions, in the stories that unfold within that frame. Greenberg\u2019s imagined world is a patchwork map sewn together from the territories of culturally ingrained mythologies\u2014ancient Greece, the Hebrew Bible, Norse legend, and the above-mentioned", ", among others. Part of the considerable charm of the book, at least for a particular kind of pedantic reader (i.e., this one), is in spotting these allusions and inspirations, and the clever means by which she integrates them and deviates from them.", "The comic opens with a setup straight out of the Book of Exodus: Three sisters walking together along the banks of a lake in the Land of Nord (a polar region peopled by the broadly Inuit-like Nords) find an abandoned baby in a basket. They look after him together, but tensions arise\u2014as tensions inevitably must in such scenarios\u2014over who loves him the most and should therefore get to raise him as her own. So the whole non-nuclear family piles into a canoe and paddles out to the iceberg home of a medicine man to whom \u201cthe Nords deferred ... in all matters of importance.\u201d There\u2019s a King Solomon-style standoff among the sisters, and a decision is made to split the child, via unspecified sorcery of soul division, into three distinct but physically identical little boys. Each sister gets her own version of the baby, and things work out tolerably well for a while.", "It soon becomes apparent, however, that the three boys are turning out somewhat one-dimensional personalitywise; there\u2019s an angry one who\u2019s only ever angry, a philosophical one who\u2019s only ever philosophical, and a cheerful one who\u2019s only ever cheerful. The sisters realize they\u2019ve made a dreadful mistake and so contrive to have the medicine man recombine the boys into one relatively normal whole. But it further transpires that the soul had actually been split, through some basic thaumaturgical blunder, into", "parts, one of which managed to escape into the ether, thereby leaving the boy, who has now become his clan\u2019s storyteller-in-residence, feeling internally riven and incomplete. So he packs his belongings and his adorable little husky into a canoe, and sets off on a quest to find the missing bit of his soul, telling stories along the way.", "Greenberg\u2019s style, as a storyteller and as an illustrator, is both straightforward and sophisticated. Her drawings have the elegant and open simplicity of woodcuts; there\u2019s an aesthetic of artful childishness and a sort of wry, amiable tension between the old-style fables and origin myths she deals in and the contemporary language she uses. In one Cain and Abel-like story about the murderous origins of the Viking-like Dag and their ancient quarrel with the neighboring Hal, an elder brother refers to a younger as \u201ca wet little fart\u201d and \u201ca pussy.\u201d (If, by the way, you think your 10 year old can deal with this sort of mild saltiness, you could do a lot worse than steering them in the direction of this book.)", "Storytelling is, of course, the work of making beautiful maps of unknown territories.", "Greenberg has a lot of metafictional fun with the theme of storytelling. About halfway through, she introduces a cartographer named Mancini Panini who is famous for his beautiful maps, thought to have been the first to chart Early Earth. (Panini looks pretty much identical to the medicine man from Nord, and to a shaman from the South Pole. This is a running joke throughout the book\u2014\u201ca plot device that will never be explained, so deal with it!\u201d\u2014as is the fact that these supposedly wise old men tend to prove incompetent.) Panini\u2019s methodology turns out to be radically unsound; a severe agoraphobic, he gathers intelligence for his maps by sitting in his tower and peering through his telescope, and then sending out three trained monkeys in pedal boats, armed with paper and pen, to survey the terrain. His map of the world, we are told, is \u201cgenerally agreed by explorers to be completely useless since it is almost entirely wrong on every level,\u201d but he is \u201cpossessed of an excellent imagination and a steady and meticulous drawing hand, and so the maps can be valued as things of beauty.\u201d", "", "Greenberg portrays this scientific failure as integral to a kind of artistic success. Empirically, he\u2019s feeling around in the dark, afraid to even venture out into the territory he\u2019s supposed to be surveying. She doesn\u2019t overstrain the metaphor, but our man Panini is elegantly suggestive of storytelling (of art itself, really): the work of making beautiful maps of unknown territories. This is what Greenberg is about here, in her light-fingered way: inventing the world from scratch and coming up with origin myths that are\u2014and this is sort of the point of such myths\u2014almost entirely wrong on every level but valuable as things of beauty. (And being entirely wrong, of course, doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude the capturing of certain kinds of truth.)", "Courtesy of Lydia Garnett", "Her Early Earth, we learn, is the result of a competition between a god named Birdman, his son Kid, and his daughter Kiddo. The three bird-persons of this trinity, literal inventors of worlds, are, in terms of characterization, Greenberg\u2019s most well-drawn figures. As gods, they\u2019re more Hellenic than Abrahamic, which is to say mischievously and playfully human. Birdman emerges, at some unspecified point in Early Earth\u2019s prehistory, from an egg that just appears out of nowhere. (\u201cDon\u2019t ask how it got there, OK,\u201d we are instructed. \u201cEvery story has to have a beginning and this one begins with an egg, floating in an infinite, empty cosmos.\u201d Your standard chicken-or-egg cosmogony problem, handily dealt with.) He then lays two eggs of his own, from which emerge the son and daughter who eventually decide, out of cosmic childish boredom, to have a world-making contest. Early Earth turns out to be Kiddo\u2019s creation, a vast, complex world that she carries in her hair; in a fit of jealous petulance at her creative success, her brother cuts off her hair, causing it to tumble into infinity, growing in size and complexity as it falls. With this story, Greenberg is slyly rewriting the rigidly patriarchal source code of the culturally enshrined narratives she\u2019s drawing from. (See also her inversion of old-crone fairy-tale tropes to produce a heroic giant-slaying great-grandmother.) She is, in this sense, a bit like a cartoon Angela Carter.", "All this stuff might be strenuously whimsical in a work of prose fiction, but the loveliness and composure of Greenberg\u2019s illustration and her playful narrative tone make for an endearing combination\u2014and the whimsy is pretty much inseparable, anyway, from the myth-riffing project as a whole. Her stories, like those she alludes to and borrows from, are creative misreadings of the world, beautiful maps drawn from incomprehension and imagination.
