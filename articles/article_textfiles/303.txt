{"Body": ["Photo illustration by", ". Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images Entertainment.", "There\u2019s a revealing passage more than a third of the way through Megyn Kelly\u2019s new memoir,", ", after Kelly, then a local television reporter, goes to meet Roger Ailes for the first time. Ailes, who was pushed out as head of Fox News Channel this year after numerous accusations of sexual misconduct, \u201casked me how the daughter of a nurse and a college professor understood anything other than left-wing dogma.\u201d Kelly\u2019s answer:", "Contrary to popular belief, the person who wrote these paragraphs is neither a \u201cgreat journalist\u201d (in the", "of", "executive editor Dean Baquet), nor someone who \u201ctranscends politics\u201d (as a fawning", "", "last year proclaimed). But she is an extremely compelling and even mysterious personality as this excerpt, perhaps unintentionally, displays. For starters, there is Kelly\u2019s feigned naivet\u00e9 about her actual ideology and agenda. (Perhaps it wasn\u2019t always feigned\u2014the journal entry, which would have been written around the time Kelly was 18, highlights what Christopher Hitchens wrote was the difference between an open mind and an empty mind: the latter \u201cwill not stay vacant for long but will be swiftly filled up\u2014with platitude.\u201d) Kelly\u2019s Fox News show is, it\u2019s true, not strictly partisan; she can be nice to Democrats, tough on Republicans, and surprisingly passionate about liberal causes such as paid family leave. But", "is quite clearly ideological and very rarely \u201copen-minded.\u201d It is guilty of the same race-baiting and fearmongering that the rest of the network practiced throughout the election, and indeed over the past two decades\u2014a strategy that allowed Ailes to become the television legend, and legendary creep, he is now universally recognized to be. (OK, not quite universally: Donald Trump counts him as a friend and adviser.)", "Another lesson of the excerpt from her book is that Kelly still buys\u2014or at least sells\u2014the nonsensical notion that Ailes, in seeking an \u201copen-minded\u201d reporter, was committed to genuinely honest journalism, the Fox News slogans for which (\u201cFair and balanced,\u201d \u201cWe report. You decide\u201d) have become punchlines. In a memoir that forthrightly details the harassment Kelly faced at Ailes\u2019 hands, you might expect to find greater honesty about Fox News itself, and the political and ideological project that Kelly is in fact an integral part of. But no: Instead, Kelly reveals herself to be either a lot less canny than she seems or even cannier than she wants to let on. My money is on the latter.", "Kelly\u2019s opacity is fascinating, coming as it does from someone whose presentation is so firm and apparently grounded, so set in her opinions and so self-consciously self-confident. This combination of qualities is certainly what allowed her to gain such wide-ranging respect and admiration among a press corps generally (and rightly) suspicious and dismissive of Fox News. Kelly, unlike Fox\u2019s other primetime hosts, Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity, has done her best to cloud her real agenda; no one at the conservative network in its two decades of existence has managed to \u201cbreak out\u201d in similar fashion. But she still comes across in", "as a fundamentally dishonest person because she is misleading about what she actually", "every night of her show, with its obsessive focus on black people committing crimes and the New Black Panther Party\u2019s", "to our way of life. Kelly\u2019s ability to seem reasonable and dogged, while simultaneously feeding red meat to her white base, is the reason for her outsize success.", "The book itself is often as wholesome as apple pie, and as unwise to consume in large servings. Raised outside of Albany, New York, Kelly drearily traces her early years (\u201cMom was\u2014and still is\u2014a force of nature\u201d); soon she is off to college and then law school, the latter of which \u201cwas challenging, in a great way.\u201d Things pick up considerably, though, as Kelly\u2019s career starts in earnest. She is admirably upfront, for example, about her ability to manage men. \u201cMy legal training gave me several skills, but knowing how to handle men in positions of authority was easily one of the most valuable,\u201d she writes in the first of several passages on this theme.", "", "Thanks to her dedication, Kelly managed to land a gig in local television news. A year later, she had her fateful meeting with Ailes, and her career at Fox began. The Fox sections of the book\u2014she started there in 2004\u2014are the most compelling, partially because Kelly\u2019s rise at the network was so impressive, and partially because she describes people such as Ailes and Brit Hume in ways that are often vivid. (After rumors of an affair between Kelly and Hume spread, \u201cBrit was strutting around the office, proud as a peacock!\u201d)", "In the age of Trump and Cosby, Kelly\u2019s run-ins with Ailes were comparably mild, but they are still disturbing and grotesque, and the passages about them are resonant thanks to the acutely believable portrait she paints of Ailes\u2019 character and personality. \u201cI would be called into Roger\u2019s office,\u201d she writes, and \u201che would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me\u2014veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the \u2018very sexy bras\u2019 I must have and how he\u2019d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\u201d Kelly not only managed to avoid him, but also told investigators and the Murdoch family about his behavior, and offered support for colleagues who also claimed to have been mistreated. Kelly\u2019s steadfastness was admirable, and so is the honest avowal she makes at the end of her chapter about the ordeal: \u201cI built my own power. And when the allegations about Ailes hit, I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that.\u201d", "But the problem of what Kelly \u201cuses\u201d that power for remains. Too often, it has been to express opinions such as this one that she shared with viewers in 2013:", "The creepy thing about moments like this is that Kelly exudes the same certainty and passion in expressing such opinions that she does when dressing down", "or", ". Although Kelly\u2019s issues may not be the same as Hannity\u2019s or O\u2019Reilly\u2019s (or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s), she nonetheless has an agenda that is easily integrated into her milieu. Kelly attempts to differentiate herself from other offenders at her network later in the book when she notes that she has the \u201cmost successful news show in all of cable (O\u2019Reilly\u2019s is an opinion program).\u201d One of the most memorable Kelly", "occurred after Michelle Obama gave a speech that mentioned America\u2019s history of racism. Kelly listened politely while her right-wing guest talked about the \u201cillusion of systemic discrimination\u201d and piped up to add, \u201cWe are seeing, more and more, a culture of victimization. \u2026 I call it cupcake nation. That\u2019s what we are turning into.\u201d This is the real Megyn Kelly experience.", "The Trump sections of the book are the most disturbing, and in them Kelly\u2019s tough-as-nails truth-telling side comes out, or at least it keeps threatening to, before she reverts to form. She details Trump\u2019s attempts to influence her, first threatening to \u201cunleash\u201d his Twitter account on her (which he did anyway) and then somehow discovering that she was going to challenge him at the beginning of the Republican debate. Kelly even raises the", "that she was poisoned, presumably by someone connected to Trump. Later, his attacks on her were followed by death threats from the then-candidate\u2019s deranged fans.", "It\u2019s truly riveting stuff. But Kelly also claims that Trump kept trying to woo her with gifts; why did she wait until now to report this? She also claims that Trump offered gifts to many other reporters, but she didn\u2019t mention this until after the election, either. I understand why she wanted to save it all for the book, but it\u2019s odd that all these tales\u2014the Fox News leaks of debate questions to Trump, perhaps even a possible poisoning\u2014are just coming out now. Moreover, the book seems to want us to forget that once she and Trump at least temporarily set aside their feud, she was given an hour to interview him and turned in a", "on the Fox broadcast network, full of soft questions and hot air.", "I don't understand why the author is surprised that Kelly doesn't charge Fox News with bias.\u00a0  For one thing, you have to see it and I don't think she sees it.", "", "", "", "", "That hour was a sign that amidst rumors of a toned-down Fox News in the wake of Ailes\u2019 departure, Kelly is unlikely to lead a charge against the new administration at the network even if she signs another contract there. Moreover, for all the talk about a feud between Trump and Fox, well, don\u2019t count on it. Ailes may have been a television genius, but the major lesson he imparted\u2014to know your audience\u2014is a simple one that the Murdoch family is unlikely to discard. As for Ailes\u2019 role in demeaning American politics and media over several generations, Kelly is conspicuously silent.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
