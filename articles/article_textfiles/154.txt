{"Body": ["Illustration by Emily Carroll", "What makes France and the French so intimidating? Here we Americans are, citizens of the world\u2019s superpower, yet there\u2019s probably no place that fascinates us more or puts us more off balance. Is it something in the French combination of discipline and seduction, organization and grace? Forming a bridge between Northern and Southern Europe, the French (or our stereotype of them, at least) have an unsettling competence for both work and play. Americans take comfort in being more fun than Germans and more organized than Italians, sure. But then, the French: women who know Proust and know how to dress, men who can talk geopolitics or seduce your wife. We Americans, in our uniforms of sneakers and baseball caps, visiting from our country with no history, can\u2019t quite compete.", "But we want to, oh how we want to communicate, to understand this culture, and to be accepted by it. For many of us, this starts with learning the language\u2014usually with ridiculous results. I\u2019ve been studying French for most of my adult life, and have lived in Paris for the last four years of it. Even with my hard-won proficiency, I experience those ridiculous results on a regular basis. The sad truth is that I will likely never be truly fluent. My daughter was born here and, at not yet 3 years old, she can untangle the confusing differences between masculine and feminine nouns better than I can. She starts at a Paris nursery school this week, and I\u2019m dreading the day\u2014not far off\u2014when she begins correcting my French.", "When I brought up Dr. Seuss, everyone gave me that quizzical, vaguely shocked look that told me I\u2019d done something wrong.", "So why do adult language learners even bother trying, when faced with these seemingly insurmountable odds? This is the question William Alexander opens with in his perfectly pleasant and lightweight book", ". Fifty-seven years into a life spent revering the French, he sets out to finally learn the language. Is it possible for a man of his age to do this? Well, the first half of the book catalogs all the steps Alexander takes that are", "actually taking a French class. Instead, there\u2019s Rosetta Stone, a French pen pal, French in Action videos from the 1980s. He takes the reader on a trip to meet IBM\u2019s universal translation program team and along on his seven-hour odyssey through Julia Child\u2019s croissant recipe. These become\u2014as he freely admits\u2014avoidance techniques rather than aids in his quest for fluency. \u201cIt was, all in all,\u201d he tells us, \u201cfar more entertaining and less stressful", "about learning French than actually learning French.\u201d", "I spent a lot of", "arguing with Alexander\u2014pleading with him to just sign up for a class, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s no surprise to me\u2014nor, probably, to you\u2014that he doesn\u2019t achieve fluency, and makes his greatest strides during a two-week Provence immersion class in the book\u2019s final chapters. Studying French stresses out Alexander so much that he blames the language for his persistent heart arrhythmia. It was hard for me to relate to this Woody Allen level of neurosis: palpitations because you can\u2019t remember", "?", "But perhaps I\u2019m being unfair. French", "scary, in part because of our stereotype of French people as haughty and rude\u2014as David Sedaris puts it, in American films, \u201cwhen someone makes a spectacular ass of himself, it\u2019s always in a French restaurant, never a Japanese or Italian one.\u201d France also has, as Alexander reminds us, the venerable", ", an appointed body that has been meeting since the 17", "century, whose purpose is to define and decide what exactly is and is not correct French. Most languages don\u2019t have this kind of official governing body, and are free to grow dialects and adopt new slang without much fuss. However, in France there are official statements declaring common Anglicisms like", "and", "forbidden. It\u2019s intimidating enough to cause occasional bouts of", ".", "French also lives up to its reputation as a language filled with sexual innuendo. If you plan to learn the language, just accept that you will be humiliated a few times by accidentally making a sexually suggestive remark when you\u2019re just trying to, for instance, buy bread. Oh, I have so many examples to choose from in my own life, but here\u2019s one: The word for", "in French is", ", not unlike in British English.

Yep, you make a lot of friends when you\u2019re asking strangers \u201cIs this the ass?\u201d", "Photo courtesy of J. Ferrara Photography", "Or, take the case of Dr. Seuss. When I was pregnant during my first year in France, I was hunting for some classic children\u2019s books in French. It made sense that the French wouldn\u2019t be familiar with Dr. Seuss\u2014translating Seuss\u2019 bouncing rhymes into another language was surely no mean feat\u2014but when I brought his name up, everyone gave me that quizzical, vaguely shocked look that told me I\u2019d done something wrong. Uh-oh\u2014what now? An American friend who is married to a Frenchman clued me in:", ", as we pronounce it in English, is the same as the French word", ", meaning to suck. But of course, because it\u2019s French, it\u2019s also slang for giving a blowjob. This is a language where America\u2019s favorite children\u2019s author translates as Dr. Blowjob\u2014my friend\u2019s husband went so far as to declare \u201cNo daughter of mine is reading something called Dr. Suce!\u201d", "So I do sympathize with the pitfalls and possible\u2014no, make that definite\u2014embarrassments of learning French. But at the same time, reading Alexander\u2019s book felt a lot like hanging out with my father, someone whose attitudes toward France were shaped by the 1960s. Alexander expresses his love for France through references to Camus, Truffaut, and the hapless ordering of unknown organ meats during his youth. It\u2019s all very", ", and while he does visit the France of 2014, it\u2019s always with the intent of recapturing a part of this past\u2014he and his wife, for example, spend their time in Brittany searching out a particular beach from an Eric Rohmer film. But I wonder if all these romantic ideas about France aren\u2019t actually getting in his way. Learning grammar and the French subjunctive is far more tedious than sipping espresso and commenting on", ", but you can\u2019t do the second one without going through the first one.

You can learn from your Rosetta Stone that it means \u201chello.\u201d But in France, bonjour means much more than that. It\u2019s a ritual of politeness that\u2019s taken very seriously, the opening of any conversation with someone in an official capacity. In France, you don\u2019t walk into Starbucks and order without looking at your barista\u2014you look them in the eye and say \u201cbonjour\u201d first, a small acknowledgment of their humanity. If you forget to do this, as many Americans do, you may find yourself getting bonjour\u2019d by a French person\u2014they\u2019ll say \u201cbonjour\u201d to you slightly forcefully, to remind you of the courtesy, like a person who\u2019s held the door for you saying \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d when you forget to thank him.
