However, for most books (trade and mass-market books), the jacket is no longer needed as a protective outer layer. These books\u2019 boards are cheap, durable, and undersigned (around the turn of the 20", "century, the decorative aspects of the book\u2019s covering transferred from the binding to the jacket itself). If, for the majority of books, the jacket no longer serves a protective function, it still shields the subcutaneous narrative metaphorically. As we spend more of our reading time in digital, disembodied, notional environments where texts lack differentiation and may easily leach into one another unconstrained, covers (and physical books in general) remain part of an anxious cultural effort to corral and contain the boundless. The cover is a skin, here, in the sense that it provides a book with a unique face, and in so doing, it helps establish a text\u2019s unique identity. The cover thus holds (in the sense of constrains) and restricts (in the sense of tethers) the text.", "Courtesy of George Baier IV", ". The text requires a context. A text also requires some kind of preamble, a throat clearing, an entryway, an antechamber. Jackets are the visual equivalent to the foreword, or to a front door. The jacket is a paratextual neutral ground between text and world.", "Courtesy of George Baier IV", ". A distinct jacket mapped to a distinct text helps index that text, identify and remind you of it. If you are looking for it, it is easier to find. If you need a mnemonic device for it, simply picture the jacket in your mind\u2019s eye.", "Courtesy of George Baier IV", ". Reading takes place in another realm, in a nebulous, mental realm. The jacket is the souvenir we take back with us from these metaphysical travels. In this sense, the jacket is a snow globe, a T-shirt, a commemorative key chain.", "Courtesy of George Baier IV", ". The jacket tells you what the book is: what the title is, who the author is, what the book is about, what genre it may belong to. It will tell you who else read and enjoyed this book. The jacket is a grab bag of information: some primary, some subsidiary, some important, some annoying trivial. A jacket, like an information booth, will also locate you \u201cgeographically,\u201d if, like me you use flaps as bookmarks.", "Courtesy of George Baier IV", ". Books and book jackets help us decorate our living spaces. They allow us to live prettily among our accumulated wisdom. (Presuming that we have read our books.)", "Courtesy of George Baier IV", ".
