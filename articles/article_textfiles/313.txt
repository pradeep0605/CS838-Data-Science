{"Body": ["Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", "The era of Barack Obama is over. Eight years of liberal governance yielding a surprisingly comprehensive list of achievements. A stimulus program that stanched the bleeding of the Great Recession and set the stage for an extended period of job growth and rapid innovation in key sectors of the economy. A bailout of the automotive industry that rescued millions of jobs and saved an entire region from economic ruin. A health reform law that, despite its flaws and problems, patched critical gaps in the U.S. health care system and extended coverage to millions of Americans. A financial reform law that established strict new requirements for banks and made consumer financial protection a key priority of the federal government. And an ambitious plan to reduce carbon emissions and spare the world from the worst consequences of global climate change. Within each of these, you could find smaller programs that brought outsize impact, seemingly modest initiatives that, if they happened under any other Democratic president, would be praised as major achievements.", "Jamelle Bouie is", "s chief political correspondent.", "Or at least, that\u2019s the argument", "magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait makes in his early retrospective on the Obama presidency,", ". And in the wake of recent events\u2014the election of Donald Trump, his inauguration, and his rapid move to implement an ethno-nationalist, plutocratic agenda\u2014it\u2019s almost a comforting argument. As Chait writes, \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s presidency represented one of those great bursts. It was a vision and incarnation of an American future. His enemies rage against and long to restore a past of rigid social hierarchy or a threadbare state that yields to the economically powerful. But he, not they, represents the values of the youngest Americans and the world they will one day inhabit.\u201d", "There is no doubt that some portion of Obama\u2019s presidency will endure. Republicans are just now, for example, beginning to see the massive political challenge involved in repealing the Affordable Care Act and upending the health care system as it presently exists. But Chait, in his optimism, understates the force of backlash, of the fierce reaction that always meets progress and often overtakes it, both as it exists and as it", "exist. And his confidence that Obama\u2019s legacy will survive gives short shrift to how backlash isn\u2019t just a bump on the road to a better future. It is a lived experience, one that can consume entire lives\u2014whole generations\u2014before the \u201carc of the universe\u201d begins to move back toward progress.", "What\u2019s missing from Chait\u2019s analysis, put simply, is a sense of tragedy. In that he\u2019s not too different from Obama himself, whose soaring invocations of a \u201cmore perfect union\u201d often understated the costs of backlash, even as he acknowledged the possibility. Given his place in the landscape of political journalism, however, it\u2019s no surprise Chait makes the same omission. Writing from first the", "and later", "magazine, Chait has long been a strong defender of the Obama administration and Obama-style liberalism, not just from the right, but from the left as well. Wary of the dogmatism (and increasingly illiberalism) that now defines movement conservatism, Chait also critiques what he sees as the same when it emerges on the left (or more precisely,", "left).", "You could see all of this\u2014his affinity for Obama and support of mainstream liberalism, his optimistic view of the present course of American life, and his wariness toward left-wing critiques\u2014in his", "with the", "magazine\u2019s Ta-Nehisi Coates that ranged over topics including welfare reform, the", "\u2019s racial history, the notion of a \u201cculture of poverty,\u201d and the question of racial optimism. In that debate, which he recapitulates in somewhat veiled form at the beginning of", ", he endorses Obama\u2019s view of racial progress against Coates\u2019 more skeptical and circumspect position. \u201cIt is one thing to notice the persistence of racism, quite another to interpret the history of black America as mainly one of continuity rather than mainly one of\u00a0progress,\u201d", ", a line echoed in the book, as he contends that Obama made substantive progress on advancing racial equality. \u201cThe growing awareness of racism among liberals during his presidency gave new force and prestige to a belief that racism was endemic not only to [America\u2019s] history but its very character,\u201d he observes. \u201cWhen liberals bring up the history of American race relations, they usually emphasize how little has changed, rather than how much.\u201d", "is a work of triumphalism, hardly diminished by the outcome of the election.", "Chait\u2019s self-positioning in the ecosystem of American politics isn\u2019t mindless contrarianism. It comes from a sincere belief that liberals (and the left more broadly) are too stubbornly fatalistic to see that Democratic presidents, and Obama in particular, make real headway on their goals and priorities, despite inevitable obstacles, setbacks, and failures. \u201cThe American state of the present day has a dramatically more progressive cast than it did a half century ago, and it had a more progressive cast a half century ago than it did fifty years before, and on and on. Yet the progressives who produced these victories have lived them as deflating failures. They have made the same errors of perception again and again,\u201d writes Chait.", "is his attempt to correct this error. To show progressives that their pessimism and fatalism is unfounded, and to show that\u2014", "their view of the present\u2014Obama was a success. A huge one. \u201cObama presented a new vision of America, to the world and to itself. And he had, to a degree hardly anybody recognized at the time, made his vision of a new America real,\u201d writes Chait. But here\u2019s where the problems begin. It\u2019s not that Chait doesn\u2019t have a point\u2014although, this point may have been stronger had Hillary Clinton prevailed in the presidential contest\u2014but that he overcorrects, understating the real political and policy failures that marked Obama\u2019s tenure. He fails to tackle the more sophisticated critiques of the administration, from both the left and the right, typically aiming his counterarguments at Obama\u2019s weakest critics instead.", "And so, on the recession and housing crash, Chait spends his time dueling with tendentious and partisan opponents like Amity Shlaes and Charles Krauthammer\u2014who slammed any stimulus as unnecessary and harmful\u2014rather than critics like journalist David Dayen, who", "that the administration dropped the ball on housing relief in a way that prolonged economic pain, undermined the recovery, and contributed to the discontent that nearly derailed Obama\u2019s presidency at several points, and may yet derail his legacy.", "You could lodge a similar complaint about Chait\u2019s own treatment of heath care reform in this book. For as much as the Affordable Care Act has been a success\u2014and Chait details all the ways that is true\u2014he gives short shift to glaring problems like inadequate subsidies (premiums and deductibles are still too high for many millions of Americans) and the absence of actual universal coverage. Chait is correct to argue that all major social programs are inadequate at the start (Social Security was threadbare and designed to appease Southern segregationists in the Roosevelt coalition), but that doesn\u2019t erase the impact of what that means in the moment for actual people.", "This gets to the general problem with triumphalist narratives, and Chait\u2019s brand of triumphalism in particular. A teleological framing of history tends to discount what it actually means to live through and experience setbacks. The eight-year administration of Ulysses S. Grant saw genuine progress for black Americans. They secured voting rights and won federal protection from racist vigilantes; they elected leaders to the House and Senate, and built thriving communities for themselves. This was dismantled in fairly swift fashion by a backlash of conservative politics and while vigilantism. One way to look at this is to say that, in the long run, Grant\u2019s legacy\u2014and that of those black Americans\u2014survived. The story since that period has been one of slow progress built on those gains and experiences. But the other way to describe it is as a long twilight, where black Americans struggled under the weight of oppression until circumstances and events allowed them to recover and reassert earlier gains. Yes, there was progress, but at the cost of generations of pain and suffering.", "Chait\u2019s triumphalism, his teleological view of American history, discounts what it means to experience that twilight. Put in more concrete terms, the fact that Obama\u2019s accomplishments will likely endure\u2014the fact that Donald Trump cannot blot them from the record\u2014will not console the Americans who see family deported, who see children killed by unaccountable police officers, who see the richest Americans siphoning the nation\u2019s wealth for themselves. Even if we recover from the policies of the Trump administration\u2014even if a new liberal era emerges in response\u2014it won\u2019t change what ordinary people suffered through; it won\u2019t restore the loss.", "I'm mostly ambivalent about Obama but he's going to look like a genius in the history books compared to the clowns surrounding him.", "", "", "", "", "is a work of triumphalism, hardly diminished by the outcome of the presidential election. And in its confident defense of the mainstream liberal consensus, it fits comfortably into Chait\u2019s oeuvre as a writer and a thinker. Which is to say it suffers from the same overconfidence that led those same liberals\u2014Obama included\u2014to discount the threat of Donald Trump. Committed to a teleology of progress, albeit open to the reality of historical irony, this liberalism lacks a visceral sense of the tragic. That sense of tragedy\u2014that sense that those inevitable reversals engender real pain for real people\u2014is vital. It puts confidence in its proper context, revealing that\u2014even if we are right about the direction of the world\u2014we cannot forget the suffering that comes in those \u201czigs\u201d and \u201czags\u201d of history. Perhaps, if liberals like Chait\u2014or even myself\u2014were more attuned to that possibility of profound loss, then maybe we would have better anticipated the present moment and all the pain it promises.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
