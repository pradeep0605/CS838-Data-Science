I had read the story more than once shortly after it was published in the", ", and its selection for the annual anthology is not hard to understand: \u201cMissionaries,\u201d which depicts two young men preaching the Mormon gospel in Knoxville, Tenn., is engaging and nicely crafted, with dramatic but believable scenes that build toward one character\u2019s ambiguous but striking epiphany. It\u2019s a pretty good short story. But it got Mormonism all wrong.", "David Haglund is the literary editor of NewYorker.com.", "I couldn\u2019t see past that. It was clear to me that Tice himself wasn\u2019t Mormon, and never had been;", ", and the missionaries\u2019 routines didn\u2019t match those I\u2019d heard about. More vaguely but also more importantly, the attitudes and personal bearings of the missionaries just didn\u2019t seem", "to me. I never served a mission myself\u2014I decided I didn\u2019t believe in the Latter-day Saint gospel right around the age, 19, when young men usually begin preparing for their missions. Perhaps because I never had the experience I wanted badly to read an account of one that had the ring of truth and the shape of a good story. There was no rule in my mind that it had to be written by a Mormon. Fiction writers should feel free to imagine the lives of any sort of people, whatever their own backgrounds may be. But if you\u2019re going to tell the stories of others, you have to get them right\u2014particularly, perhaps, when you\u2019re inventing things about a minority group that holds a certain fascination for the majority. If it looks like you haven\u2019t done all the work it takes to really understand these people different from yourself, the attempt to tell their story can feel almost exploitative\u2014like you\u2019re trading on other people\u2019s curiosity, without earning the trust or faith of those with a greater claim on such stories.", "It\u2019s a complicated matter, and that may sound a bit proprietary\u2014especially given that I walked away from the everyday practice of Mormonism a long time ago. But that\u2019s how \u201cMissionaries\u201d made me feel. It got me thinking and, eventually, writing about", ". In the couple of years since I published a piece on that subject, a handful of writers have mentioned reading it as they gave me copies of their own books.

He\u2019s also been published in a 50-year-old Mormon quarterly called", "that\u2019s currently edited by my cousin, and for which I used to serve as poetry editor. The community of people with an interest in serious Mormon fiction is not enormous.", "is set in Brazil in 2003 and written from the close third-person perspective of two missionaries, Elder McLeod and Elder Passos. (\u201cElder\u201d is a priesthood title conferred on all male missionaries.) The latter is a native Brazilian\u2014there are more than 1 million Mormons in Brazil; it\u2019s long been more receptive to LDS proselytizing than most places. Passos, we learn, was receptive because his mother died when he was young: Mormons believe that families reunite in the afterlife. The church\u2014and the mission\u2014also represents for Passos a path to the United States and a college education at BYU. McIlvain dissects the mix of need and ambition and genuine faith that fuel a disciplined devotion to a demanding way of life, and he\u2019s also sensitive to the sometimes imperial obliviousness of Mormon missionary efforts overseas. At one point, the mission president\u2014the church authority who oversees those efforts in a given region\u2014while speaking to his American and Brazilian charges, asks them, and \u201cnot rhetorically,\u201d \u201cHow do you say", "in Portuguese?\u201d The tensions between Passos and McLeod that are at the heart of the novel are exacerbated when the United States invades Iraq, and Passos, like many of his countrymen, becomes more scornful of the United States.", "McIlvain has obviously worked to understand his Brazilian protagonist, but it\u2019s the American one who feels not only thought through, but lived in. His motivations are murkier, and his attitude more ambiguous. McLeod didn\u2019t have a strong testimony in the Mormon gospel before he left for his mission, but was committed to \u201cexperimenting on the Word,\u201d living out the faith in the hope that a testimony would come. It doesn\u2019t go that well. This is not a tale of disillusionment, building toward some atheistic epiphany\u2014it\u2019s more earthbound than that. Very earthbound, in fact: McLeod and Passos are both tormented often by the temptation to masturbate. A fellow missionary enduring the same struggle\u2014a struggle which, it should be noted, both Passos and McLeod frequently, and very realistically, lose\u2014shows McLeod a pamphlet titled \u201c", ",\u201d which you can find pretty easily online (though", ").

That tedium is a challenge for the novel: There\u2019s not a tremendous amount of obvious drama in these men\u2019s lives. Much of", "concerns the attempt by Passos and McLeod to convert a young woman named Josefina and her husband, Leandro. The dynamics of the situation are complex\u2014McLeod becomes attracted to Josefina, though he has a hard time admitting it, and Leandro is jealous and a drunk\u2014but the principals spend just a few hours together each week (at most), and those hours are so formally constrained that not much can really happen. The book builds to a fairly drastic resolution, but it takes a while to get there. Admirably, McIlvain doesn\u2019t go in for cheap plot devices or easy melodrama. But I sometimes thought this story lent itself more to a novella than a novel.", "As it happens, while I was reading", "another work of fiction arrived in the mail, with the title", "and a familiar portrait of Joseph Smith on the cover. (No personal note this time.) I cracked open the collection by Shawn Vestal and found a short story called \u201cWinter Elders,\u201d which grabbed me from the opening line: \u201cThey materialized with the first snow.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d are a pair of missionaries, and the man who sees them in the snow is an ex-Mormon named Bradshaw. This is a tale of missionary work from the perspective of the target. And it is a dark tale. It\u2019s also psychologically astute and elegantly written, like much of Vestal\u2019s book. Other stories dig into the Mormon past and imagine life after death. With his interest in violence and carefully wrought sentences, Vestal occasionally recalls Brian Evenson, who is probably the most accomplished ex-Mormon fiction writer at the moment. (Check out Evenson\u2019s riveting and disturbing", ", for a start.)", "That honorific may sound comically specific, but McIlvain, Vestal, and Evenson\u2014not to mention Udall, whose status in the church I\u2019m not sure of\u2014prove that it\u2019s not an easy title to hold. Is there such thing as a \u201cgreat Mormon novel\u201d? Will there ever be? I\u2019m not sure. But there is now, undeniably, a Mormon presence in American letters. (Looking beyond fiction there are several other notable writers with Mormon pasts: Terry Tempest Williams, Neil Labute, Dustin Lance Black, and so on.) This is a good thing, I think, for American letters\u2014and for Mormonism. In fact, it\u2019s the latter effect that strikes me more today. In 2010, when I wrote about \u201cthe great Mormon novel,\u201d I was more concerned with how such a book might affect readers mostly ignorant of the religion. I wrote that \u201ca great Mormon writer might change how the religion is perceived in the wider culture\u201d and \u201cmake plain to those who doubt it that one can be Mormon and intellectually serious at the same time.\u201d", "Courtesy of Brinn Willis, left, and courtesy of Dan Pelle, right", "For", "", ", the years since 2010 have taught many Americans quite a bit about Mormonism. But for me, they\u2019ve been a more interesting time", "Mormon culture, broadly defined. Though Vestal and McIlvain and Evenson (and Black and Labute and Williams) have all left the church, they\u2019re all still engaged with it to varying degrees, still wrestling with its meaning and its legacy. And there are plenty of Mormons, even if it\u2019s a small minority of churchgoers, who are interested in what they have to say. Increasingly, it feels reasonable to think about \u201cMormon\u201d as a category that includes people who don\u2019t go to church, or who don\u2019t even believe in God. Much of the LDS faithful would dispute that, I suspect\u2014but some of them also probably think, consciously or no, of such people as part of the fold. Fiction can introduce you to worlds you don\u2019t know, and put you in the shoes of people who aren\u2019t like you. But it can also expand your sense of your own tribe, and what it means to belong to it. I still hope that a novel will come along that makes lots of non-Mormons feel what it\u2019s like to wear Mormon shoes, so to speak (or", ", perhaps). But I\u2019m also gladdened by books that enlarge the idea of Mormon-ness, and help me understand why, several years since my last visit to church, I still feel a part of it.", "---", "by Ryan McIlvain.
