{"Body": ["Mirrors can be the unlikeliest of deceivers. They suggest a clean retelling of just the facts, an accurate reflection of what\u2019s placed before them, without judgment or commentary. But of course what we see in a mirror isn\u2019t always the truth, at least not exactly. It\u2019s the surface of things, and even that is often distorted. We know this, yet we can\u2019t stop looking at them for confirmation. We crave the reflection, choosing to trust its accuracy against our better judgment.", "Photo by Piotr Cieplak", "Helen Oyeyemi\u2019s latest novel,", ", begins with just this conundrum. \u201cNobody ever warned me about mirrors, so for many years I was fond of them, and believed them to be trustworthy,\u201d says Boy, the first of the book\u2019s three titular protagonists. That doesn\u2019t stop her from obsessing over mirrors, to the point of kissing the glass with her fists against it, her mouth meeting her \u201cmouth.\u201d And she\u2019s not the only one: Snow, her stepdaughter, and Bird, her daughter, have similarly troublesome and obsessive relationships with the reflective material\u2014in their case, they occasionally don\u2019t see any reflection at all.", "A magical mirror? You know that old story. On its surface, the plot of", "is the Snow White tale told from the perspective of the stepmother\u2014the sort of turnabout tactic made standard thanks to books like", ". But the talented Oyeyemi takes a familiar story, sets it for the most part in 1950s New England, and removes almost all the familiar imagery, making it her own. There are no dwarves, no poisonous apple, and no awakening kiss. In its place are simply women. Women of all ages, races, economic backgrounds, and motives. Women who deal with, and sometimes inflict, all the horrible injustices\u2014racism, abortions, questions of sexual identity\u2014that aren\u2019t on display in a Disneyfied version. Women who, with no Prince Charming on the way, must instead find ways to solve their own problems.", "\u201cCinderella just sweeping up all those ashes every day and never putting them into her stepmother\u2019s food or anything\u2014is that true?\u201d", "The fifth novel from the enviably prolific (and enviably young) Oyeyemi defies classification, seeming to dip its toes in one genre, say magical realism, hop out, and settle into historical fiction or fractured fairy tale. Or perhaps the story\u2019s a mystery. Oyeyemi is constantly changing perspectives and narrators, alternating between the first-person narration of her protagonists and letters written between Snow and Bird, keeping her readers at full attention. As she did in her previous book,", ", Oyeyemi in telling a story explores how stories are told. As with the mirrors that haunt the novel, the reflections we get from Oyeyemi\u2019s narrators are often unreliable and only shown to us when convenient, revealing many unexpected details that we don\u2019t see at first\u2014either because of our own biases or because we haven\u2019t been given all the information.", "Take the \u201cevil stepmother,\u201d Boy, who settles down in a Massachusetts town with Arturo Whitman\u2014a widower with a daughter, Snow. (The name Snow Whitman is the book\u2019s only overt reference to the classic fairy tale.) When her own daughter is born, Boy sends Arturo\u2019s beloved Snow away\u2014a move that feels more biblical, calling to mind Sarah\u2019s banishment of Hagar and Ishmael after Isaac\u2019s birth, than evil. The world of this novel is one in which mothers and daughters disappear from each other\u2019s lives: Boy doesn\u2019t know what happened to her mother; Snow\u2019s mother died shortly after giving birth; Arturo\u2019s mother sent one of her daughters, Clara, away to live with an aunt\u2014only to have the next generation do the same thing, sending Snow to live with Clara.", "Unsurprisingly, in a novel about appearances, the sending away has everything to do with physical traits. The adored and praised Snow may appear to be white (\u201cskin as white as snow,\u201d as the saying goes), but her half sister Bird has a darker appearance, suggesting that the Whitmans are in fact a light-skinned black family attempting to pass as white\u2014yet another deceptive name and another deceptive appearance.", "As in", ", where a character comes to life to scold her author for killing off a story\u2019s heroines, magic sits side by side with the banality of day-to-day life in", ". It\u2019s left to the reader to decide what she wants to believe\u2014does Bird really speak to spiders, as one vivid scene seems to suggest? What exactly is happening with the mirrors? Not everything makes sense\u2014but not everything has to. Oyeyemi isn\u2019t just pulling the rug out from under our feet, playing with our assumptions about how people look\u2014she\u2019s holding a mirror up to our memories of fairy tales and of history. Just as we so desperately want to trust mirrors even though we shouldn\u2019t, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t trust her, no matter how convincing she can be.", "But then Oyeyemi is less interested in deceiving us than she is in letting us know we\u2019re being deceived. Over and over again we read the fairy tales that the characters tell each other, and each time Oyeyemi has them doubt the veracity, and sometimes the validity, of one version of a story over another. Bird, Arturo explains, used to love hearing the Cinderella story before bed. She never expressed approval or disapproval, but one night she asked if the story was true. \u201cNot the fairy godmother stuff and her dress turning back to rags at midnight\u2014I know that\u2019s true. But Cinderella just sweeping up all those ashes every day and never putting them into her stepmother\u2019s food or anything\u2014is that true?\u201d To a young girl, that is the most implausible part of the story, and her father can\u2019t see the harm in telling her", ". \u201cSo what\u2014she can\u2019t prove it isn\u2019t true,\u201d he figures.", "It\u2019s not just Boy, Snow, and Bird who, in some way, discover themselves by doubting their mirrors. In the end, one of the novel\u2019s biggest transformations takes place as a result of coming face-to-face with one\u2019s reflection. But, like a good mirror, I won\u2019t reveal everything here. I\u2019ll leave that to Oyeyemi\u2019s stunning and enchanting fairy tale.", "---", "by Helen Oyeyemi.
