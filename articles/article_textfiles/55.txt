{"Body": ["Courtesy Columbia Pictures", "ilm acting is the last great mystery of the contemporary cinema.

Celebrity actors may have human foibles, but they also possess an indescribable aura that is constitutive of their power over us. Even Stanislavski\u2019s infamous \u201cmethod\u201d approach is suffused with the language of \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201cillusion.\u201d We know that there are processes involved in the creation of a screen performance, but, more often than not, even the process stories we tell about actors are about a kind of prestidigitation\u2014Daniel Day-Lewis becomes", "by Abraham Lincoln or Charlize Theron", "within the grotesque visage of a serial killer.

So much film criticism\u2014and, recently, television criticism\u2014is bound up in auteur theory, in the deconstruction of directorial genius or folly. (Indeed, Phaidon\u2019s last collaboration with", "was on a series of books about prominent directors entitled", ".) This mode doesn't exclude actors, but rather situates performances as tools\u2014if often blunt or brilliant ones\u2014in a director's toolkit.

If the creation of a character is a magic trick, what are the mechanisms behind it?", "The books are, in essence, critical biographies\u2014narratives of an artist told through close attention to 10 of his or her films. The danger of a project like this is that, by spending this kind of time alone with a star, the critic might become star-", ". In other words, the idea of", "is a laudable one, but, especially given the A-list subjects under consideration (so far:", ",", ", Streep, Nicholson), it\u2019d be all too easy for one of these studies to lose its critical edge.

Beverley Walker\u2019s", "is, in many ways, a sharply written, phenomenally well-researched fan\u2019s account of the actor\u2019s career. It is full of fascinating production anecdotes and makes use of deep archives to detail the actor\u2019s engagement with the creative process. But, at the same time, the book retains a kind of reverence for its subject that can be frustratingly repetitive.", "Courtesy Beverly Walker", "Walker too frequently defers to the ineffable magic of acting\u2014and, beyond that, the legend of", ", the icon in the sunglasses in the front row of the Oscars\u2014as the central motor force of the actor\u2019s career. It\u2019s true that any serious book about Nicholson must first establish that Nicholson himself is serious. And while the actor\u2019s outsize off-screen personality threatens to become the story, Walker is careful always to present Nicholson as a craftsman. But that craft remains an occult one to the reader. \u201cThere is a mystery at the center of the actor\u2019s art,\u201d Walker writes, \u201can indefinable", "we can\u2019t quite put our finger on.\u201d But I want the", "series to", ", or at least complicate, that mystery, not simply to marvel that it exists.", "Karina Longworth has a much less rascally or showy celebrity persona to deal with in her book", ", and, perhaps in part for that reason, it resists the play of mystification and demystification that occupies much of Walker\u2019s study. Longworth, working with pages upon pages of Streep\u2019s extemporaneous comments on her art, has fashioned a book that is as much a study of the actress\u2019s idiosyncratic career as it is a treatise on the state of feminism in contemporary film.", "Courtesy Karina Longworth", "Longworth\u2019s great strength is as a close reader\u2014of individual scenes, of Streep\u2019s loopy theorizations about acting and feminism, of relationships between Streep and her collaborators. And as much as all of these passages forward a narrative of the actress\u2019s creative evolution, they also provide the springboard for well-earned arguments about the cultural impact of Streep\u2019s ascendance. In her opening chapter on", ", for instance, Longworth writes about the layers of Streep\u2019s performance in a thanklessly written role: \u201cIn making the pain and frustration of powerless women real and visible in a vehicle that otherwise spoke to an increasingly conservative public, [the role] critiqued the mainstream while participating in it\u2014an act of subversion that passed as submission.\u201d In other words, especially in her early career, Streep fought to give real texture to the anonymous female roles that were the only ones available to her.

Streep plays characters, Nicholson plays himself.", "", "-mikestand", "", "", "", "So from the very beginning, this dynamic\u2014Streep struggling to develop an artistic voice from within a masculine and often misogynist creative culture\u2014becomes our central object of concern. And it is frankly shocking, as well as inspiring, to read about the number of times Streep forced herself to intervene in order to give a sense of agency or even human complexity to characters she had agreed to play. Streep insisted, for instance, that her role in the divorce drama", "\u2014a role she took only a year after her breakout success in", "\u2014be rewritten in order to allow her character\u2019s perspective into the space of the film. She established herself as such a force on set that, when they came to the scene in which her character finally articulates her argument for why she should retain custody of her son, the filmmakers let Streep write the dialogue herself. If you\u2019ve ever thought that Meryl Streep is often the best thing in a given film, this book is a play-by-play account of why that is.", "Longworth\u2019s book functions as both a biography of a star and a theory of stardom. It is a nuanced, enviably readable work of cultural studies. Film critics today are intensely knowledgeable about process, from distribution and marketing to form and style. This is a knowledge that extends to the filmmaking process but sometimes stops short at the actor.

To offer an account of how their choices translate from set to screen, how they resonate for viewers in the dark of the theater and in the light of day, is not to destroy the magic we associate with movie acting.
