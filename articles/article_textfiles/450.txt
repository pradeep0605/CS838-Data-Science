Psychologists, feminists, biologists, animal rights activists, and Al Gore have all lined up to denounce him. In philosophy, Descartes\u2019 famous theory of mind-body dualism had been limping for centuries before Gilbert Ryle finally put it out of its misery in 1950. Ryle coined the fatal phrase \u201cthe ghost in the machine\u201d to describe Descartes\u2019 idea of the immaterial mind mysteriously operating within the body, directing our actions.", "There have been more recent blows too. The neurologist Antonio Damasio, in his 1994 best-seller", ", attacked Descartes\u2019 separation of reason and emotion. In the history of animal rights, Descartes is cast as a lead villain for his claim that animals were no more than sophisticated machines, incapable of feeling pain. (\u201cI opened the chest of a live rabbit and removed the ribs to expose the heart and the trunk of the aorta,\u201d he merrily wrote to a friend in 1638.)

Unloved, his arguments served up to undergraduates as target practice, Descartes has fallen on hard times.", "In his slim new book", ", Steven Nadler does not specifically set out to rescue Descartes from ridicule. But by situating him firmly in his time and place, he makes clear what made Descartes the intellectual superstar of his day\u2014\u201cthe greatest philosopher in a century full of great philosophers,\u201d in Nadler\u2019s words.", "Born in 1596 in the village of La Haye (which has since been renamed after its famous son), Descartes went on to attend, from age 10, one of the top Jesuit colleges in France. There he received the finest education in Aristotelian philosophy and, in Nadler\u2019s words, \u201cscientifically antiquated but religiously acceptable theories of the cosmos.\u201d It was this orthodoxy Descartes would later overturn. While he is remembered today as the philosopher who said, \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d Descartes\u2019 work extended much further. He was a brilliant mathematician and he wrote extensively on biology, optics, and cosmology. In science, his grand project was to replace the abstractions of Aristotelianism with a mechanistic picture of the universe that could be explained solely in terms of matter, motion, and impact. In philosophy his quest was for a point of absolute certainty, the solid foundation upon which he could build a new system of thought. The clich\u00e9 about Descartes is that he asked the right questions (What can we know for sure, and by what method can we find it out?) but gave the wrong answers. That might not sound like much, but when they were first published Descartes\u2019 ideas landed like an explosion. Today we\u2019re still feeling the ripples.", "Nadler\u2019s account of Descartes\u2019 life begins with a painting. The", "has historically been attributed to the great Dutch portrait painter Frans Hals\u2014but there is no record of their meeting, and by and large Hals stuck to painting his patrons, who were not thinkers but wealthy businessmen. Is the portrait really by Hals? And if so, is it really a portrait of Descartes? And if it is, who brought the thinker and the philosopher together? Nadler seeks out the answers by reconstructing Descartes\u2019 life in the Netherlands, where he wrote and published many of his major works. \u201cDescartes belongs as much to the intellectual culture of the Dutch Golden Age as he does to the grand history of Western philosophy,\u201d Nadler tells us. Look deep into the painting, he says, and you will see the philosopher\u2019s mind.", "It\u2019s an original, intriguing set-up. In the age of Wikipedia, the traditional cradle-to-grave biography seems less and less appealing, and writers are twisting the genre into new and interesting shapes. However, in the case of", ", it is a twist too far.", "One problem is the portrait itself. The most memorable images of philosophers not only reflect their personality but end up helping to shape the way that they are remembered by history. It\u2019s hard to doubt that David Hume was the genial guy his French admirers called", "when his image is fixed as the half-amused, roly-poly fellow of", ". Because of their power, portraits can be useful tools in intellectual PR campaigns. To combat the prevailing image of", "as a misanthropic gloom-monger, Bryan Magee deliberately chose a", "of the philosopher for the cover of his biography.", "In Descartes\u2019 case the go-to portrait doesn\u2019t tell us much about its subject. It is iconic but bland. From here, Nadler\u2019s problems multiply. In investigating the story of the picture, he must tell at least three further stories\u2014that of Descartes (the philosopher), Hals (the painter) and Augustijn Alsten Bloemaert (the priest who commissioned the painting). What\u2019s more, Nadler aims to explain the whole of Descartes\u2019 philosophy and science, and give the reader a sense of life during the Dutch Golden Age\u2014all in the space of a 200-page book. It\u2019s not surprising that after introducing the priest and the painter as major protagonists, Nadler is forced to abandon them until their brief cameos at the end.", "As a piece of storytelling, Nadler\u2019s book is flat, but as an introduction to Descartes\u2019 philosophy, it is excellent. Nadler follows recent scholars such as Desmond Clarke in emphasizing Descartes\u2019 role as a philosopher of the scientific revolution. This helps explain why Descartes was so keen to establish the position for which he would be later ridiculed\u2014that mind and body are distinct substances. Dualism was a weapon against obscurantism. Descartes wanted to cut away, in Nadler\u2019s words, the \u201cspiritual or mind-like elements (such as the immaterial forms and qualities of the Aristotelians)\u201d that were commonly associated with the physical realm. Descartes replaced this spiritual understanding of matter with something simpler. As Nadler explains: \u201cThe exhaustive and exclusive division of mind and body\u2014", "is", "mental", "physical\u2014provides a metaphysical foundation for his new mechanistic picture of the world. Whatever takes place in the physical world is to be explained by material principles alone.\u201d Out with the mysterious \u201caccidental forms\u201d and \u201coccult qualities\u201d of medieval philosophy; in with matter, motion and impact.", "Courtesy of Jane Bernstein", "Nadler dedicates one of the book\u2019s best chapters to Descartes\u2019 masterpiece, the", ", a member of that elite philosophical club that, like Plato\u2019s dialogues or Nietzsche\u2019s", ", also qualifies as great literature. Written in the first person, the six short meditations are constructed almost like a diary in which, over the course of six days, the narrator goes from doubting the certainty of even his most basic beliefs to, by the end, developing a deeper understanding of the nature of reality. (This story\u2014loss of faith, introspection, subsequent reconnection with first principles\u2014deliberately echoed classic works of devotional literature such as Augustine\u2019s", "). The", "unfolds late at night, with Descartes", "\u201csitting by the fireside, wearing a winter dressing-gown, holding this piece of paper in my hands, and so on.\u201d He sets a familiar scene, one into which any reader could imagine himself.", "In the first meditation he resolves to discard all his beliefs that can be subjected to even the slightest doubt. His aim is to discover an irrefutable truth upon which he can build the foundations of his new philosophy. Having thrown out his most basic beliefs (the testimony of his senses, the belief that he is not dreaming) and even those that seem harder to doubt (that all triangles are three-sided, that 2 plus 2 equals 4),", ". It is \u201cas if I had fallen suddenly into a deep whirlpool, that I can neither put my foot on the bottom nor swim to the surface.\u201d", "At the start of Meditation 2, however, Descartes arrives at a statement that he believes cannot be doubted. Even if all his other beliefs are completely false it must nevertheless be true that if he is able to think anything at all (that is, even think things which are false), then he must exist. In Nadler\u2019s helpful formulation: \u201cOne cannot possibly doubt one\u2019s own existence, no matter how hard one tries. In fact, the harder one tries, the more convinced one will be that one exists.\u201d This is the idea behind Descartes\u2019 bumper-sticker statement,", "(In the", "it\u2019s more carefully formulated as \u201c \u2018I am, I exist\u2019 is necessarily true whenever it is stated by me or conceived in my mind.\u201d)", "From this seemingly self-contained proposition, Descartes manages to spin out a series of arguments which take him from knowing nothing at all (in Meditation 1) to, by the end of Meditation 6, knowing a number of rather contentious things: the nature of mind (thinking) and body (extension in space), the distinctness of mind and body, the existence of God, and the method by which one can establish certain knowledge from mere belief (to do with what Descartes calls \u201cclear and distinct\u201d perception).", "Set aside, for now, whether Descartes\u2019 arguments are convincing or not. Philosophical contemporaries such as Thomas Hobbes and Antonie Arnauld responded to the", "with what appeared then, as now, like fatal objections. Consider instead the form of the", "It is written in the first person, but it is not an account of a week in which Descartes actually sat down and worked out his philosophy.

And this is one key to the importance of Descartes, and the", "in particular. The first letter in the Cartesian alphabet is I.", "In his epic intellectual history,", ", the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor identifies Descartes as \u201ca founder of modern individualism, because his theory throws the individual thinker back on his own responsibility, requires him to build an order of thought for himself, in the first person singular.\u201d As Descartes writes in his preface to the reader, \u201cI would not encourage anyone to read these pages unless they are willing and able to meditate with me seriously \u2026\u201d By daring us to think for ourselves, Descartes became one of the fathers of the Enlightenment and, in turn, one of the architects of our everyday assumptions and habits of thought, even today. (To take one tiny example, when Nate Silver writes, in the introduction to", ", \u201cMy preference is for topics where you can check out the results for yourself rather than having to take my word for it.\u201d\u2014 he is thinking in a way that echoes Taylor\u2019s insight about Descartes.)", "It is a shame, then, that though Nadler\u2019s explanation of Descartes\u2019 ideas is vivid, his portrait of Descartes as an individual human being is uninspired. Philosophy, even more than most academic disciplines in the humanities, always runs the risk of getting stuck in arid conversations with itself. If the subject is to reach out beyond the faculty corridors, it certainly needs more explainers of Nadler\u2019s caliber. But, to really make an impact on a wider audience, we need philosophers who can spin a story too.", "---", "by Steven Nadler.
