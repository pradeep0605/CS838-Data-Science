{"Body": ["Illustration by Jon Chadurjian", "Scott Timberg\u2019s", "begins with a harrowing and by now familiar personal narrative of the Great Recession. In 2008, Timberg, an arts reporter for the", "was laid off, a casualty of", "; soon after, the bank foreclosed on his family\u2019s house. These back-to-back misfortunes made Timberg worry about more than making ends meet: They shook his faith in the entire enterprise of American creativity. \u201cI saw myself in the third generation of people who had worked in culture without either striking it rich or going broke,\u201d he writes, but such a career path no longer seemed available in the 21", "century, and he wanted to understand why. Though there was a temptation to blame the awesome leveling power of the Internet, he concluded that \u201cthis was about more than just technology. \u2026 Some of the causes were as new as file sharing; others were older than the nation. Some were cyclical, and would pass in a few years; others were structural and would get worse with time.\u201d", "The causes of what Timberg terms \u201cthe killing of the creative class\u201d\u2014the murder suspects, if you will\u2014include a long tradition of American \u201canti-aestheticism\u201d going back to the Puritans; cuts to public funding for the arts beginning in Reagan\u2019s 1980s; rising rents and vanishing public space in urban centers; the weakening of the church-state wall between editorial and advertising in journalism; theory-besotted academic \u201cintellectuals \u2026 speaking in tongues\u201d; the decline of mainstream respect for \u201cmiddlebrow\u201d culture; the pernicious critical influence of Pauline Kael; capitalism (specifically, the contemporary variant diagnosed by", "as \u201cmarket fundamentalism\u201d and by the economists", "as \u201cthe winner-take-all society\u201d); and, yes, \u201cthe Internet\u201d (particularly file sharing and the attendant collapse of the music industry). As this list suggests,", "is an ambitious but unfocused book. The villains proliferate, the time scale expands and contracts\u2014in a couple of places, Timberg goes as far back as the cave paintings at Lascaux\u2014but the message remains consistent: People who want to make a living from art and culture now are screwed.", "What Timberg values, and wants to preserve, is in fact a pretty unusual state of affairs that arguably held for a few decades in the 20", "century, one in which active participation in artistic, creative, or bohemian culture could semi-reliably provide the material basis for a stable middle-class life. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that despite romantic myth, most artists and others who work in the world of culture come from the middle class and hope, after a few years of scrambling and bare-bones living, to return to it,\u201d he writes. The best and most substantial sections of", "are the ones adapted from Timberg\u2019s previously published profiles of", "and elsewhere, pieces in which grand explanatory theories recede into the background and Timberg becomes a sort of Studs Terkel for Freelance Nation. The second chapter, \u201cDisappearing Clerks and the Lost Sense of Place,\u201d is one of the best-reported of these\u2014though it is also the one I found myself least convinced by. It\u2019s devoted to unsung heroes of the independent retail trade, like Jeff Miller of the", "and", "of the also-shuttered Dutton\u2019s Brentwood Books. \u201cThe loss of the people who labor to put books and music and movies into our hands is bad enough, but their departure doesn\u2019t just cut into the number of people who can make a living from working in culture,\u201d Timberg writes. \u201cEvery time a shop selling books or records, or renting movies, closes, we lose the kind of gathering places that allow people oriented to culture to meet and connect; we lose our context, and the urban fabric frays.\u201d", "focuses only on what has disappeared\u2014without attending to what has risen up in its place.", "This", "defense of the Comic Book Guys of the world is passionate but unconvincing: Are we really losing something essential with these \u201cgathering places\u201d that isn\u2019t made up for by Wi-Fi-enabled coffee shops (frequently havens of creative production, not just consumption) on the one hand, and online forums for critical discussion on the other? Does the labor of culture have to happen in a store? Not to mention that such places are often, as a friend who worked in record and video stores in her youth put it, \u201cfortresses of male aesthetic precision.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t let anyone leave without giving them a barrage of my words, of the history,\u201d Timberg quotes Kabbabe as saying. Call me a traitor to the cause of art, but I would personally rather access my Hammurabi Kabbabes via the Internet, where I can escape from their word barrages by discreetly closing a tab.", "Here and elsewhere, Timberg falls prey to the professional Jeremiah\u2019s tendency to focus only on what has disappeared\u2014without attending to what has risen up in its place. Timberg is right to blanch at the astonishing number of jobs in publishing and journalism that have been lost since 2008 (about 260,000, according to a figure he cites from", "). This has, indeed, been a disaster for the creative class. But he fails to note that there are signs of life as well. In the past year, new media companies like", "and", "have raised millions of dollars\u2019 worth of venture capital ($50 and $46.5 million, respectively), a portion of which is going to hire critics and culture writers. And while the pay and benefits of many new media jobs may not keep up with the standards of a couple of decades ago, that\u2019s a problem typical of American employment across the spectrum, not an issue specific to the creative class.", "Whether or not you join Timberg in ruing the demise of the record store clerk or local arts beat reporter\u2014or the alternative weekly or the record label or postmodernist middle-class architecture, other cherished institutions whose loss Timberg mourns\u2014it is a strength of", "that it addresses not just \u201ccreators of culture\u201d but \u201ctheir often-mocked supporting casts.\u201d I just kept hoping Timberg would bring up previous studies of these figures, some of which might have added depth and nuance to his arguments and put our contemporary American moment in wider perspective. Howard S. Becker\u2019s", ", for instance, first published in 1982, is still the deepest and best discussion of how \u201csupport personnel\u201d", "such as sound mixers, art handlers, printers, gallery employees, roadies, and the like function in a larger ecology of creativity. Timberg might have lined up today\u2019s \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d dynamics next to those at work in Paris in the 19", "century, as charted by Pierre Bourdieu in", ", or compared the employment situation of today\u2019s culture creators with what the economist Hans Abbing studied in his rigorous, data-rich analysis", "But he never cites any of those thinkers.", "Photo bySteven Dewall", "Timberg is right, of course, that this is a scary and confusing time to be a creative professional. But \u2019twas ever thus, pretty much, as even a quick glance at intellectual history suggests. George Gissing\u2019s", ", published in 1891, laid out the plight of writers whose lives were upended by a previous wave of creative destruction and technological innovation\u2014in his case, the decline of the lending library and the rise of the mass-market press, which utterly transformed the market for popular fiction. \u201cYou can make a killing in the theatre, but not a living,\u201d the playwright Robert Anderson is reported to have said in the mid-1950s\u2014at the height, in other words, of government intervention and middlebrow respect for art. Look a little harder at the problem and you\u2019ll find that things are tough all over, chronologically as well as geographically.", "In some ways, creative people, broadly defined, are better off in the U.S. today than they have been throughout much of human history. The fact that commentators can now refer to a \u201ccreative class,\u201d as Timberg does in his subtitle (borrowing a now popular phrase", "by Richard Florida), reflects a world in which politicians and city planners recognize the economic value of bohemian life. There are, of course, downsides to this mindset, in which creativity is mostly a harbinger of gentrification\u2014Thomas Frank has dubbed it \u201c", ".\u201d Still, this contemporary outlook would have astonished the struggling writers of Gissing\u2019s day, and reflects, in part, the spread of creative work in the current economy.", "There is, ultimately, an unnerving sense of entitlement to", ", well-intentioned as it is, and that entitlement is largely generational. The real sting in the tail of Timberg\u2019s polemic is not, as he would have us believe, that things are worse for creative people than they\u2019ve ever been before. It\u2019s that things are considerably worse than they were 20 years ago. Throughout", ", the 1990s function as a go-to", ": \u201cthe peak years of journalistic employment, especially for newspapers,\u201d the height of architectural innovation, the heyday of indie rock. His choice of interview subjects (David Lowery, Dean Wareham, David Byrne) betrays an obvious bias toward aging Gen X icons. Timberg makes clear that he\u2019s \u201cnot particularly interested in James Cameron \u2026 or Kanye West: Celebrity and corporate entertainment\u2014good and bad\u2014hardly needs defenders.\u201d Yet he\u2019s not very interested in the genuinely marginal, obscure, or underprivileged, either\u2014or in anyone under 40: Timberg\u2019s interviews are all with white men who did extraordinarily well in the 1990s (or occasionally the 1980s or early 2000s), and are doing worse (but still reasonably OK) now. One can hardly blame folks like Lowery or Byrne for complaining about the relative decline of their industries: They have firsthand experience of an", "to share and probably (even correctly) view themselves as spokesmen for the many suffering artists who don\u2019t have a comparable platform. But Timberg certainly could have tried harder to talk to a wider swath of the creative class beyond his personal social circle and those he comes into contact with on his promotional rounds.", "As a precariously perched culture worker myself\u2014and one just five years shy of 40\u2014I don\u2019t want to pretend that there\u2019s nothing at stake here, or that Timberg\u2019s concerns are completely overblown. He argues sensibly for more \u201cmiddle-class protections\u201d for the creative class (though the policy details of this are left sketchy\u2014one suspects he just means protections for the middle class generally), and worries that the \u201conly people who will be able to work in culture will be those who don\u2019t need to be compensated\u2014celebrities, the very rich, and tenured academics.\u201d This is a reasonable thing to worry about.
