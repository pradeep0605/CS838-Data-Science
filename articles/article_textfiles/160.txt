{"Body": ["Illustration by Emily Carroll", "It\u2019s said that the Irish novelist Eimear McBride wrote", "", "taped up above her desk: \u201cOne great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot.\u201d McBride, more completely than any recent novelist I\u2019m aware of, has translated this crucial truth into style.", "In", ", her debut novel, she\u2019s invented a new way of telling: one that, while it resuscitates several key tropes of modernism (not least the resistance to easy pleasure), is something all its own, wisely trading James Joyce\u2019s linguistic blarney for an ambitious vision a great deal slimmer. You\u2019ll feel Joyce\u2019s influence, certainly, as well as that of Samuel Beckett (and what Irish writer could really avoid these two?), and yet McBride\u2019s novel feels weirdly outside of literature, despite having been hustled to the forefront of it, racking up a number of prizes in Europe. The prose, while seeming literarily anarchic, is actually quite focused, stripping sentences to their bare bones not as part of some stylistic exercise, but to convey immediate experience as lived. The effect can be, at times, less that of literature than of the video feed:", "Although time seems collapsed here (\u201cSummer. Spring.\u201d) it is nonetheless written live.", "The novel\u2014published in the U.S. by Coffee House, a press with", "\u2014is a portrait of the disruptive force of sibling love, between the girl of the title and her terminally ill older brother, and its entanglements with sin. A shared childhood, beautifully rendered, progresses into the usual separations forced by school and a dawning awareness of sex, an early adulthood destabilized by change, and the progression of a final illness painted so crystal-clear it is almost impossible to read. (McBride has experienced this, as anyone who also has will see at once\u2014here there be trigger warnings.) The near-total lack of names suggests that a kind of universalism is the point.", "From the novel\u2019s first lines, the speaker is not immediately clear:", "Soon though, it becomes clear that the narrator, who is not yet born, is recounting a scene between her (unnamed) mother and brother. The boy has a brain tumor and undergoes an operation that will leave him physically and mentally scarred. Dialogue\u2014here the mother telling her son he can name the unborn narrator\u2014is embedded in the sentence along with the twists and turns of internal contradiction; scenes collapse into each other, layering. \u201cMammy me?\u201d seeks confirmation but, without the comma, is also a plea.", "It\u2019s a lesson in just how far the rules of the English language can be bent before comprehension falls away.", "McBride\u2019s path into this raw, unfiltered state of prelinguistic experience\u2014a state, one might as well note, stereotypically gendered as feminine\u2014leads through the (typically masculine) form of the short, percussive sentence, cutting the flow of thought into biting, often contradictory chunks. There are few commas (normal or inverted) and many, many full stops. These seem related, maybe, to C\u00e9line\u2019s ellipses, chopping reality up into units without fragmenting it completely, suggesting, by their placement, something else intruding or occurring alongside what is perceived. The prose is syncopated but is propelled forward by this series of driving, stuttered blocks. Verb forms are twisted, prepositions dropped. Contradictory thoughts and emotions sit side by side, irresolute. McBride\u2019s aim, it seems, is to capture experience almost", "to thought, dropping the reader into events at the very moment the narrator, too, encounters them.", "Courtesy of Jemma Mickleburgh", "Despite its complexity, McBride\u2019s novel does not, as Joseph Collins wrote of", ", require \u201ca course of training or instruction.\u201d I quickly grew used to the way in which scraps of dialogue are tossed around and peppered into sentences, and there is little that is abstract about McBride\u2019s language itself. If it has been", "\u2014the narrator is a poet of a kind\u2014the comparison is accurate only in as much as it tends to flirt with rather than embrace conventional grammar, choosing rhythm and internal rhyme (\u201cA right hook of a look in his eye all the time\u201d) over straightforward exposition. But McBride, though she does indulge in the figurative, is never really lyrical; her words seek not admiration but transparency. And many of the ungrammatical, almost prelinguistic sentence fragments\u2014\u201cMy thud cheeks up,\u201d for example\u2014are instantly understood. It\u2019s a lesson in just how far the rules of the English language can be bent before comprehension falls away, as though McBride had discovered a pidgin of the reptilian brain. There are moments where she compromises this oblique style somewhat, throwing her reader a bone, whether in long passages of dialogue or at the beginning of chapters where it\u2019s necessary to establish a scene: \u201cWe\u2019re living in the country cold and wet with slugs going across the carpet every night. Now when you are seven eight. Me five.\u201d There are moments where, for clarity, the uncle needs to be \u201cUncle\u201d rather than \u201che,\u201d or the mother \u201cMammy\u201d rather than \u201cshe.\u201d", "hews closely to what the feminist philosopher Julia Kristeva called the \u201cdark revolt of being\u201d that looms within abjection, \u201cdirected against a threat that seems to emanate from an exorbitant outside or inside.\u201d For McBride\u2019s narrator, the threat is personified by her brother\u2019s tumor (\u201cCosy kernelled in your head\u2026Nasty thing. Having a chew\u201d), but there are other threats too: the absent father, certainly, and the overbearing force of the mother\u2019s Catholic faith. Half-formed, the girl uses abjection to separate herself\u2014herself and her brother both\u2014from all these things. For her, abjection takes the familiar form of sexual promiscuity, beginning at 13 in an encounter with her uncle and developing through many partners into a blooming masochistic need. There is a great deal of ambiguity here\u2014in the girl\u2019s conflicted response to the initial incest-rape, in the moments of pleasure experienced between pain and fear, and in the way guilt over her actual or perceived complicity acts both as relief and an inducement to continue. In these guilty moments, scraps and passages of liturgy force their way into the text as through the narrator\u2019s conscience, their phlegmatic Catholic weight providing, like all those full stops, both anchorage and (narrative, rhythmic, emotional) impedance. Before having sex with her uncle, she wades into the lake, a kind of baptism\u2014the first of many\u2014in which she humiliates herself before God prior to the more visible, literal abasement. Humility, repentance, anger, guilt, and abjection are all tangled up here in a specific, Catholic mess.", "While she doesn\u2019t understand her erotic adventures, necessarily, or exactly desire them, the narrator does, as Kristeva put it, \u201cjoy\u201d in them:", "As she sees it, sin is a way to separate herself from the spiritual world of her mother. Sin allows her body, her self, to be real, and there is a kind of beauty in this, along with a host of contradictory emotions. In one of the book\u2019s very few moments freighted with symbolism, the narrator smashes a statuette of the Virgin, as though metaphorically joining her schism from her own mother\u2019s faith with the confusion, guilt, and joyful relief that will attend the loss of her own virginity, at the hands of the uncle, in the next chapter. \u201cI am happy,\u201d she says after that event. \u201cSatisfied that I\u2019ve done wrong and now and now. What now? Calm sliding down into my boat and pushing out to sin.\u201d Sin, like love, is freedom for her but also a form of revenge which keeps her from being free. It also, the novel is careful to note, makes her an object, the titular \u201cthing\u201d: \u201cMe the thing but I. Think I know. Is that the reason for what\u2019s happened? Me? The thing.\u201d In her affectless, distant narration, the girl finds existence in alienation. So: A woman invites violence to be done to her, is (joyfully) made a thing of, and becomes a subject again through, of all things, a kind of guilt bound up in love. This form of redemption, if that is what it is, can be wearying.", "And yet, attempts to reduce", "to such simple, programmatic readings will be frustrated by the way events are narrated: The immediacy of the prose sets it outside of symbolism, and so sexual violence\u2014in particular a gut-wrenching and, in its typographic transgressions, almost onomatopoetic scene towards the end\u2014is not allowed to stand for much, isn\u2019t recuperated by message or theme. It\u2019s not so much sublimated by art as purified of it. The brother, too, easily a Christ-like innocent, dying for his sister\u2019s sins, isn\u2019t that, and so death is given the full and awful weight with which it presents. All of this is deeply uncomfortable, and McBride, to her credit, allows discomfort to stand, along with the rest of her novel\u2019s difficult contradictions. What she does, even in the dense prose of her beautiful final scene, is give discomfort room to breathe:", "Allowed to exist in the fullness of this ambiguous proximity to love, even abjection can be a form of beauty. There is no sublimation, no transformation of it or its horrors, just a recognition that it exists, in the thick of things, arm in arm with love, with joy, and all the rest.", "---", "by Eimear McBride.
