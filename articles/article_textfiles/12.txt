I don\u2019t know whether [", "] is a young adult book or children\u2019s book or adult book that somehow sneaked its way into a children\u2019s bookstore. I don\u2019t actually think about the audience. I don\u2019t think about my readers at all. I think about the story I\u2019m writing and whether I\u2019m writing it clearly enough to please me. If you asked what sort of audience I would like, I would say a mixed one, please. Children keep your attention on the story because you want to tell it so clearly that nobody wishes to stop listening. And the adults remind you not to patronize or underestimate the intelligence of the children.", "They\u2019re often bracketed together, Tolkien and Lewis, which I suppose is fair because they were great friends\u2014both Oxford writers and scholars, both Christians. Tolkien\u2019s work has very little of interest in it to a reader of literature, in my opinion. When I think of literature\u2014Dickens, George Eliot, Joseph Conrad\u2014the great novelists found their subject matter in human nature, emotion, in the ways we relate to each other. If that\u2019s what Tolkien\u2019s up to, he\u2019s left out half of it. The books are wholly male-oriented. The entire question of sexual relationships is omitted.", "Tolkien was Catholic, which meant that for him, there were no questions about religion. The church had all the answers. But Lewis was different. He was a Protestant, an Irish Protestant at that, from a tradition of arguing with God and wrestling with morality. His work is not frivolous in the way that Tolkien is frivolous, though it seems odd to call a novel of great intricacy and enormous popularity frivolous. I just don\u2019t like the conclusions Lewis comes to, after all that analysis, the way he shuts children out from heaven, or whatever it is, on the grounds that the one girl is interested in boys. She\u2019s a teenager! Ah, it\u2019s terrible:", ". And yet I respect Lewis more than I do Tolkien.", "Well, the", "is of course a retelling of the Miltonic temptation and fall, but most of that happens after", "ends. And what I wanted to do was represent the fall as entirely", ". It is good for people to know things, to grow up, to become sexual beings.", "It wasn\u2019t on a sentence-to-sentence basis. But you mentioned the Miltonic similes, and those were deliberate allusions. The epic context demanded that there be a certain epic quality to the language. I didn\u2019t get too close to Milton, though, and there was never a moment in the writing process where I felt, \u201cI\u2019ve got that wrong. Oh dear, I\u2019d better change it.\u201d It is my story, and I will do what I want with it. I remember the words of William Blake: \u201cI must create my own system or be enslaved by another man\u2019s.\u201d", "Well, I suppose that would be a fair description. I reveled in and loved the Romantic poets\u2014Keats, Shelley, Coleridge\u2014and Romantic music, too. The music of Beethoven, Wagner. All of the cultural poets of that time are very close to me. So I suppose I could be a Romantic poet: post-Romantic or imitation-Romantic, if you like.", "The descriptions of the North\u2014those are out of Book 2 of", ", and my imagination, and other books I\u2019ve read. I\u2019ve never been to the Arctic. Milton never went to hell either.", "But I should say that my other connection to that story, the temptation and fall, is that I grew up as a Christian in the Christian tradition. It was in the \u201960s\u2014right before there were really big changes in the language of the liturgy: a new English Bible, new forms of Anglican worship. Well, I missed all of those. The language that surrounded me in the church was the language that had been used for 400 years. I found myself very much a part of that particular history, those hymns and those words and prayers, that specific phraseology. It was my inheritance. I don\u2019t believe in it any more. But I love churches, going into churches, listening to the language. It will never leave me.", "I think the Good Samaritan is probably the best. It is so clearly told, so simply conceived, that having heard it once you\u2019ll never forget it. Jesus, like so many of the preachers wandering Galilee, was a tremendous storyteller. He wielded words and images with enormous genius. \u201cWhen you see a speck in your brother\u2019s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your eye\u201d\u2014that is just a wonderful image, and so true. I wonder what would\u2019ve happened if he hadn\u2019t been arrested and executed. Would he have gone on and written a book? We know he can write because we have a description of him writing in the dust \u2026", "It\u2019s possible!", "\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing, growing up. It\u2019s a great thing to become interested in big questions like why we\u2019re here, what\u2019s the purpose of everything.\u201d", "You\u2019ve touched on something that is very crucial to my conception of the book, because when I was beginning to write it, Lyra did not have a daemon. She was alone. It was hard to write because what I really needed was someone for her to talk to. It was a technical problem. And when I realized that she had a", ", that she wasn\u2019t alone, it suddenly became much easier.", "But the question of how she felt\u2014when Lyra first meets Iorek, she feels profound pity for him, on account of what she assumes to be his loneliness. But then she comes to realize that he\u2019s not human, he can do all these things, he\u2019s a bear, he\u2019s different. Perhaps his armor is his daemon. Perhaps he has no need of a daemon. The relationship between the person and the daemon is a very interesting, intricate, and profound one.", "Yes, except you can\u2019t choose your daemon. You have to see who it turns out to be.", "I think we all really like animals! We would all like to have spirit companions. It may be as simple as that. I can\u2019t remember how the notion came to me except that it just sort of appeared, but it wasn\u2019t just having daemons that was important; the important thing\u2014the key to the whole story\u2014was realizing that children\u2019s daemons", ". They take their final form when the children come into adulthood, into some sort of adolescence. That was the big key to the whole story because I realized, then, that the book was about innocence and experience. The transition in the human form from one to the other.", "When you\u2019re a teenager, there are different ways of being, different personalities you try on. You want to be like all the other boys and girls in the group. And you also want to be distinctive in some way\u2014to be yourself, to express your own personal form. So the daemon reflects those contradictions for a time. Then, it takes its shape. That\u2019s the \u201cabundant recompense\u201d\u2014that\u2019s when you settle into yourself.", "I didn\u2019t do it for any sort of political reason. I didn\u2019t look around and think, \u201cOh, we really need a story about a strong-willed young girl.\u201d Lyra was the personality that came to me. She was simply the way she was. And she was the one who dictated things.", "Her personality. The fact that she was so strong, so individual. But she\u2019s not\u2014I like to stress this to people\u2014an unusual child. She\u2019s very ordinary. I was a teacher, I used to teach girls her age, and there were many Lyras. Many Wills too.", "Yes.", "The story is about a particular person. She is a person who I hope is alive, who can grow and develop. There\u2019s only so much to say about the theology; I think the story is more about children at that age and how they grow up and change. It\u2019s a great thing, growing up. It\u2019s a great thing to become interested in big questions like why we\u2019re here, what\u2019s the purpose of everything. But along with that comes a sense of lostness and doubt, and at significant times there is more or less doubt, more or less knowledge. To me the process is an extraordinary thing.", "There are a number of writers of books for children who\u2019ve written books in Oxford, or have put Oxford in their books. I think that\u2019s a tribute to Oxford. The setting does have a certain hold on me. Maybe it\u2019s the veils of mist that come off the river and dissolve reality ...", "I will tell you \u2026 that I am writing it. OK, I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s about Lyra\u2014Lyra at a different stage in her life. It\u2019s not a prequel or sequel. It will be a companion novel, if you will, to", ", though that story is finished. As I go, I\u2019m discovering things all the time about Lyra, about daemons, about dust, about the whole universe. It\u2019s exciting for me.", "No. Those works are complete. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t change the first two; with", "", "I would perhaps have liked to take another sixth months. But so many people were writing me and begging me: \u201cHurry up! Hurry up!\u201d I don\u2019t feel that it is a bad book, though. I\u2019m happy with it.", "Yes! I love it because the illustrator, Cl\u00e9ment Oubrerie, is an artist whom I greatly admire. I\u2019ve liked him long before I knew that he would be working on my books.", "Exactly. It looks like he did it in a hurry. I like that. He has such command of his pen\u2014he can do all manner of different expressions on people\u2019s faces. And it\u2019s not quite like I imagined it, but that doesn\u2019t matter.", "Very pleased indeed. I believe the greater length and time is necessary for the story to stretch its wings.", "I\u2019m an executive producer! And I have no idea what that means.
