So Duckworth designed her own way of scoring candidates, giving each a survey that tested his or her willingness to persevere in pursuit of long-term goals. She called this measure \u201cgrit.\u201d And guess what? Grit worked. The cadets\u2019 survey answers helped predict whether they would make it through the grueling program.", "Duckworth\u2019s best-seller peddles a pair of big ideas: that grit\u2014comprising a person\u2019s perseverance and passion\u2014is among the most important predictors of success and that we all have the power to increase our inner grit. These two theses, she argues, apply not just to cadets but to kids in troubled elementary schools and undergrads at top-ranked universities and to scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs.

How to raise your kids, how to unearth your inner passion, how to find a higher purpose\u2014like other self-help authors, Duckworth finds authoritative answers to these questions, promising to change how we see the world. And like other self-help authors, she pulls a sleight of hand by which even widely held assumptions end up looking like discoveries. It\u2019s as important to work hard, the book contends, as it is to be a natural talent. Who would disagree with that?", "Zach Teris", "Consider the recent run of best-selling pop-science books, often citing the same body of research, that purport to give us new, better, and more scientific ways to tweak our mindsets, get rid of our bad habits, and put in the", "it takes to build a better life.

If grit really works as both a diagnostic tool and a target for intervention, then it could help the elite and underprivileged alike. It could elevate the strivers to even greater heights, while pulling up the ones who are too often left behind.", "But a closer look at Duckworth\u2019s seminal research, as well as some recent studies from her colleagues in the field, suggest there isn\u2019t much supporting evidence for either of her theses. It now appears that someone\u2019s grit, as compared with other, more familiar measures of her character, may not matter in determining success. And there\u2019s good reason to believe that intervening to enhance a person\u2019s passion and perseverance\u2014\u201cgrowing grit,\u201d as Duckworth calls it\u2014would be highly inefficient.", "You can expect to hear Duckworth\u2019s message many times in the weeks and months ahead, as it comes to dominate the culture of self-help: \u201cGrit is good.\u201d This maxim hides shortcomings in the work, however, and it overlooks a crucial fact: The single-minded pursuit of single-mindedness may carry dangers of its own.", "* * *", "Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo.

(That\u2019s how grit is measured: Students assign themselves a score of 1 to 5 for each of 10 related character statements; the 10 scores are then averaged together.) This was Duckworth\u2019s first case study, and it delivered a clear and forceful message: If you want to make it through basic training, you gotta have grit.", "Here\u2019s another less surprising way to frame the same research: Grit matters, but only in specific situations that require strength of will.", "To make it through Beast, cadets must perform extraordinary feats of mental and physical stamina.

But for most people, life may be less like a marathon than a series of sprints, interspersed with periods of rest, conversations with our friends, and hours upon hours spent browsing the internet.", "Even the task of graduating from West Point itself doesn\u2019t really compare to the trials of Beast.

For one study, she surveyed 149 undergrads at the University of Pennsylvania, finding that the students\u2019 grit and SAT scores\u2014the latter used as a proxy for their natural aptitude\u2014were each and independently related to their school performance as measured by their grades. Even for these brainy Ivy Leaguers, grit seemed to be just as important as intelligence.

Since everyone in her study was superbright, even the very brightest weren\u2019t that much brighter than the rest of the group.

In the case of Duckworth\u2019s brainy Ivy Leaguers, this makes their SATs seem less important for predicting how they\u2019ll do in school and exaggerates the relative importance of their grit. If she\u2019d mixed the same people in with a more balanced sample of their peers, let\u2019s say those with average SAT scores closer to 1,000, then the link between their aptitude and grades would have appeared more pronounced\u2014and that would in turn have made the correlation with their grit seem less impressive.", "In her paper on this research, Duckworth notes that the same issue might also work in the opposite direction: If the Ivy Leaguers were somewhat grittier than other kids, then the signs of their hard work would also be reduced in the analysis. Still, you\u2019d expect this distortion to be more pronounced for the students\u2019 SATs, since we know they were selected for admission to the university precisely on the basis of those scores.", "This isn\u2019t just an issue with one of Duckworth\u2019s studies.

For any given outcome in a person\u2019s life\u2014whether he might turn out to be a drunk, let\u2019s say, or a genius or a crook\u2014researchers would devise a brand-new measure, calibrated to predict it. \u201cIt had a brutal elegance,\u201d Roberts says, \u201cand I often pine for those days, to be honest with you.\u201d", "But this rampant sowing of new ideas made it hard even for the specialists to find their way within the field.

In other words, there\u2019s no evidence that the differences in how we\u2019re treating kids today\u2014the standard range of parental styles and pedagogic modes\u2014are doing much at all to grow (or shrink) their grit.", "The church of grit has grown so rapidly in the past few years that even Duckworth has been calling for a pause.", "It may even be the case that a child\u2019s personality is no more (or less) amenable to change than his basic cognitive skills.
