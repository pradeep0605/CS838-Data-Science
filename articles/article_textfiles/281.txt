Nowhere is this truer than in the titular short story in this new collection, which unspools around the silence of cancer, a word we never hear and a condition from which there is no escape.

It\u2019s easy to imagine the book becoming a kind of hand-me-down classic to teen girls; it\u2019s easy to forget that a book this seemingly simple has to be made with impeccable care and craft.", "This post-apocalyptic fable won two major Ignatz Awards at this year\u2019s Small Press Expo, and it\u2019s so confident a comic it\u2019s easy to see why Goldstein is considered a major young talent.
