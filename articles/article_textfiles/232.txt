{"Body": ["Photo by John Kelsey", "In a piece of flash fiction titled \u201c", ",\u201d Lydia Davis makes an eloquent case for negativity. In the story, a teacher inspired by Buddhist doctrine urges his colleagues to alleviate their negative feelings by identifying \u201cemotion as an emotion\u201d and practicing \u201cmindful breathing\u201d and other feel-good platitudes. His audience is skeptical. \u201cFar from being troubled by their negative emotions,\u201d Davis writes, the teacher\u2019s peers \u201cliked having negative emotions, particularly about him and his message.\u201d A mere 282 words, \u201cNegative Emotions\u201d is deliciously defiant, a powerful defense of anger and distaste. At a time when new age philosophers and trendy TED-talkers proselytize from every corner of the Internet, insisting on emotional stability in even the most destabilizing circumstances, there\u2019s something to be said for a healthy dose of doom and gloom. Nothing grates like gratuitous cheerfulness. There is, after all, so much to hate.", "Feminist writer and filmmaker Chris Kraus\u2019 novel", ", originally published in 2006, is not the festival of negativity we deserved but the festival of negativity we needed in those\u2014and these\u2014artificially untroubled times. As fresh today as it was when it first came out,", "joins Twitter personalities like", "and", "to resist the cult of relentless positivity, cultivating a much-needed counter-aesthetics of despair.", "Depressing to a fault, the book follows would-be experimental filmmaker Sylvie and her French-Jewish husband, Jerome, a Columbia University professor and celebrity intellectual incapable of producing any new material. While Sylvie writes unsuccessful grant proposals and ruminates on her failures as an artist, Jerome obsesses over his father\u2019s murder in a concentration camp and plans a book, to be titled", ", that he never manages to write. Jerome is lazy, passive, and underachieving, but his fixation on all things morbid has made him something of a curiosity to the academic establishment. As Sylvie\u2019s hard work goes unappreciated in the art world and the academy alike, Jerome hobnobs with the likes of French theorist F\u00e9lix Guattari and receives fellowships to complete projects he won\u2019t as much as begin. Sylvie resents Jerome\u2019s undeserved success, and Jerome resents Sylvie\u2019s demands on his attention and affections.", "There is something charming about Sylvie and Jerome\u2019s stylized gloom. Like Edward Gorey, they are the purveyors of a tongue-in-cheek melancholia that is anything but humorless.", "After much wallowing\u2014\u201cJerome and Sylvie had both memorized whole parts of", "at age 13,\u201d and the couple observes \u201cthe deepest", "\u201d in their pet dog\u2019s \u201crheumy eyes\u201d\u2014they decide to travel to Romania, where Sylvie hopes to salvage their marriage by adopting one of the disintegrating country\u2019s many orphans. Jerome, who has always trivialized Sylvie\u2019s desire for a child, humors her grudgingly, and the couple drives from Berlin to Romania, stopping at major destinations along the way. Half the time, they find Eastern Europe suitably bleak and uncomfortable. The other half, it frustrates their savior complex by proving unexpectedly quaint. \u201cThere was hardly any misery at all. Prague had turned out a disaster,\u201d Kraus writes of Jerome and Sylvie\u2019s short detour to the Czech capital, adding wryly that \u201cwhen Jerome and Sylvie drive through Prague\u2019s well-restored medieval walls, they\u2019re amazed to see the city teeming with well-dressed attractive people. \u2026 Brown University seems to be especially well represented.\u201d But much like", ", Jerome and Sylvie\u2019s poorly planned adopt-an-orphan project ends before it really begins, and they return to America empty-handed. This time, they\u2019re unable to even appeal to the comforting illusion of a brighter future brimming with adoptive children and finished manuscripts.", "A pastiche of newspaper clippings and narrative,", "integrates history and invention: Real-life figures like Guatarri and Georges Perec make appearances throughout, and we\u2019re treated to a series of depressing newspaper clippings about the disintegration of various Soviet satellite states after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The aim is to diagnose an ailment that we\u2019ve yet to treat: an insistence on happiness when happiness isn\u2019t warranted, a panicked intolerance of anything or anyone unpleasant or sad, a civilization bent on excluding its discontents. In defiance of therapists and well-adjusted friends, Sylvie and Jerome pursue a revolutionary contrarianism, nursing their malaise and taking perverse pride in operating under the pessimistic principle articulated by Guattari and his acolytes. Change, they maintain, \u201cwould always happen for the worse.\u201d", "There is something charming about Sylvie and Jerome\u2019s stylized gloom. Like Edward Gorey, they are the purveyors of a tongue-in-cheek melancholia that is anything but humorless. They are dour to the point of caricature, and they know it better than anyone. But behind their more sensationalized agonies is a reserve of quieter pain, and we get the sobering sense that Sylvie and Jerome have transformed their unhappiness into a source of amusement out of necessity, to make it bearable. Beneath Sylvie\u2019s tired appreciation for \u201cJean-Paul Sartre\u2019s classic ur-text of depression\u201d and eminently predictable love of the Sex Pistols song \u201cGod Save the Queen,\u201d featuring the refrain \u201cno future,\u201d is a \u201cdeeper and more ancient sadness.\u201d She \u201csees her marriage to Jerome as a love story that could be summed up in just three lines.", ". She guesses it\u2019s no better or no worse than any other.\u201d", "This is one of many moments of real poignancy in", "\u2014one of many moments reminding us that Sylvie and Jerome\u2019s misery is as serious as it is cartoonish. The pair understands that their suffering is absurd, inconsequential in the face of the material deprivation that characterizes much of the world\u2014but this understanding isn\u2019t comforting. It only adds guilt to estrangement, insult to injury. The whole mess is a joke on the one hand and a tragedy on the other, as Kraus suggests in a passage at the beginning of the book: \u201cIt is 1989 or 1990. George Herbert Bush is President of the United States and the Gulf War has just begun in Saudi Arabia.\u201d She continues:", "Sylvie and Jerome\u2019s exaggerated despair boils down to this same yearning, this same desire for a relationship uncomplicated by global politics and the accompanying imperative for guilt. While Jerome and Sylvie\u2019s friends respond to the chaos with a \u201ctremulous sincerity,\u201d becoming invested in their own lives, in which \u201ccards like Marriage, Family and Career are played close to the heart, and small decisions matter,\u201d Jerome and Sylvie find it increasingly difficult to go to the trouble of caring. How can they justify bemoaning the comfortable, first world collateral damage of their disintegrating marriage when the collateral damage of their consumptive habits has impoverished so much of the world? (In Romania, \u201cabout 35% of the population lives \u2026 below the poverty line,\u201d according to one of the newspaper clippings Kraus includes in the text.) If the world order is really so flimsy, if all change is really for the worse, what alternative is there to the wretched status quo? \u201cNo future\u201d indeed.", "Paralyzed by their awareness of pervasive injustice and their inability to alleviate it, Jerome and Sylvie fantasize about achieving apolitical purity. When Jerome touches Sylvie, she\u2019s no longer in the early \u201990s, in a milieu where her art is dismissed by virtue of her gender: Instead she becomes immaterial, \u201cimpossible to locate.\u201d \u201cWhen he makes her come,\u201d Kraus writes, \u201call this fucked-up gender stuff dissolves and she feels her body spinning backwards towards itself as different ages, 14, 11, once she went as far back as 5.\u201d", "But Jerome and Sylvie\u2019s attempt at transcendence fails spectacularly. Not only is their marriage heavily reliant on a traditional gender dynamic\u2014Sylvie\u2019s \u201calways been quite cynical about the signs of female heterosexuality, but with Jerome she feels protected, small\u201d\u2014but Jerome is actively dismissive of Sylvie as a thinker and artist. Though Sylvie edits a series of books by female authors published by Jerome\u2019s press, \u201cno one \u2026 recognizes these as Sylvie Green\u2019s ideas because his name appears before hers on the masthead. Though he hasn\u2019t had the time to read these women\u2019s books, the press, he reasons, is his art work. What\u2019s more, his name gives their work an added credibility.\u201d", "And so, unable to escape from politics but unable to meaningfully engage with them, Sylvie and Jerome ricochet back and forth, at times succumbing to their inert hopelessness, at times spurred to take fruitless action. Kraus presents few satisfactory solutions. She ends, fittingly, on an ambivalent note: Sylvie, abandoning New York for L.A. and emotional sex with Jerome for casual encounters with strangers, opts for an existence with \u201cno ancient tribal feuds, no wounds, no blood.\u201d Unable to transform her suffering into anything constructive, she chooses to stop caring. Meanwhile, Jerome writes in his therapy notebook, \u201cI have to keep bleeding \u2026 this \u2018bleeding heart\u2019 is a heart, and is all that I have.\u201d Sylvie\u2019s new life, we are told, is \u201cless absolute, perhaps, but better.\u201d While Jerome wallows in the eponymous torpor, Sylvie manages to trade in her overblown negativity for anodyne resignation. Kraus leaves us to choose: Anguished negativity or bloodless contentment? L.A. or New York ? \u201cMindful breathing\u201d or negative emotions?", "---", "by Chris Kraus.
