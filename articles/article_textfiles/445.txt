The repository of their contested knowledge is the", ", which stands for", ", a wildly profitable taxonomy of illnesses that costs $189 and projects an air of medical authority by defining disorders with lists of criteria. The problem with these disorders, Greenberg argues, is that they treat the mind like the body. Trying to make their profession look like any other branch of medicine, psychiatrists treat undefinable mental states like \u201canxiety\u201d as if they were scarlet fever.", "For example, as of June 2011, the first three criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in a draft of the", "were:", "A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about two (or more) domains of activities or events (e.g., family, health, finances, and school/work difficulties).", "B.

With GAD, you must hope that you and your patient are properly measuring unquantifiables like \u201cexcessive,\u201d \u201crestlessness,\u201d and \u201ckeyed up.\u201d Greenberg is a psychotherapist\u2014as well as a widely published journalist and author\u2014and he believes psychiatrists must make clear to patients that such disorders are not diseases but \u201cprovisional categories.\u201d This, he predicts, will mean \u201cfewer patients, more modest claims about what [psychiatry] treats, less clout with insurers, and reduced authority to turn our troubles into medical problems simply by adding the word", "to their description.\u201d", "He sees this humbling of the discipline as the path to an \u201chonest psychiatry.\u201d A nimble rhetorician, Greenberg implies that in its current state psychiatry is like the titular swindler of Melville\u2019s", ", from which that \u201cheart of man\u201d quotation is drawn. Psychiatrists, he says, must learn restraint. They must say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d more often. Because, from some angles, the profession looks like a confidence game. If it\u2019s a scientific study of the mind, rather than simply a mirror of our cultural values, why was homosexuality listed as a disorder in the", "until 1973?

And lest you deem these concerns academic, Greenberg points out that psychiatrists hungry for grants from Big Pharma can, for instance, revise the boundaries of bipolar disorder so that disobedient toddlers are prescribed antipsychotics.

He has launched a ferocious publicity campaign against it, arguing that its methodology must be overhauled if psychiatrists are to retain their credibility. Greenberg, like Ishmael, plays the bemused outsider. He\u2019s not sure there should be a", "at all.

That book, like", ", is set to be published soon, around the same time as the", ", and it too concerns the existential crisis confronting psychiatry. (I declined to contribute a piece.) I must also disclose that the essay Frances noticed makes an appearance in", ".

But I also mention it because Greenberg, who is an excellent, thoroughgoing reporter, makes an understandable slip in his summary of my essay. My mother hadn\u2019t \u201cgotten me diagnosed.\u201d She\u2019d arrived at my diagnosis herself, after consultations with teachers and experts dating back to my infancy. Starting when I was in pre-school, teachers called her into conferences to share their concerns about me. I liked to play by myself, bent over my little projects, and seemed not to hear when someone said something to me irrelevant to those projects. I jumped up and down and flapped my hands. I was a tree sloth on the soccer field. In elementary school I acquired a group of close friends, but was shy and bad at eye contact. Apparently, I was spooked by powerful smells and loud sounds. She consulted with a local expert on Asperger\u2019s before the diagnosis was fashionable. Though I have no memory of this, she remembers reading aloud the criteria for Asperger\u2019s from the", "when I was a teenager. In her recollection, I responded, \u201cSounds like me.\u201d By then I was mostly just pretentious, but my mother hadn\u2019t forgotten the behaviors I exhibited as a child. In our house, Greenberg\u2019s view toward the", "\u2014that it shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously\u2014prevailed. We, like Greenberg, were hippie Jews with dubious hairstyles who preferred narrative, psychoanalytic accounts of human suffering to diagnostic categories. By giving my suffering a name, my mother hoped to do me a service. When she put me in an educational video about Asperger\u2019s a few years later\u2014I agreed to be in it because I didn\u2019t know what", "meant\u2014she hoped she was doing Aspies an important service by showing them how normal an Aspie could be.", "But I was intuitive about social interaction, and Aspies aren\u2019t. (If you want to write fiction about people sitting around and talking, as I do, it can be useful to have some intuitive sense of social interaction. Although an advocate for Aspies might retort that perhaps I\u2019ve studied social interaction precisely because I lack an intuition for it.) My mother\u2019s well-intentioned diagnosis didn\u2019t do me any lasting harm, but for a while it made me more paranoid and insecure than I might have been. The other subjects in that educational video, boys chanting in monotones about Power Ranger dolls and sea-creatures, were allegedly my neurological brethren, albeit from a different place on the spectrum. At 30, I might have shrugged it off. But I watched the finished video at 22, when the transition from dork to hopefully-semi-cool Brooklynite and aspiring writer was recent, fragile, and all-important. It made me feel insane.", "This is why I\u2019m sympathetic toward Frances\u2019 argument that the", "must retain its air of certainty, its command of the field, while also becoming more stringent about what it includes. My mother is a discerning psychologist who cares deeply about the happiness of her children. She\u2019s disinclined to pathologize adolescent behavior. (When a counselor at my school diagnosed me with attention deficit disorder, she respected my refusal to take meds, and I am grateful for that to this day.) But she, like many therapists in the late \u201990s, embraced Asperger\u2019s as an elastic category. As Greenberg recalls, Glenn Gould and Vladimir Nabokov and Ludwig Wittgenstein were \u201call diagnosed\u2014posthumously of course\u2014into a Hall of Fame that, depending on which website you consult, also includes Isaac Newton, Emily Dickinson, and Albert Einstein.\u201d If the", "\u2019s criteria for Asperger\u2019s had been more restrictive\u2014if it had borne the kind of black-box warning against overdiagnosis that Frances favors\u2014it might have spared me and my mother shouting matches. Or, rather, episodes in which I shouted at her and she calmly reconsidered her position.", "Of course, it was the", "that launched the Asperger\u2019s craze in the first place. The", "\u2019s publication in 1994 was the moment the hitherto obscure disorder, which had never appeared in previous editions, entered the mainstream. Allen Frances feels responsible for the explosion of diagnoses; it was under his watch that the expansive", "criteria for Asperger\u2019s made it in. (At the last minute, and, Frances tells Greenberg, too loosely defined). By \u201csaving normal,\u201d Frances means that he wants the next generation of psychiatrists to erect a bulwark against the wanton expansion of diagnostic boundaries.", "Whereas Greenberg sees more honor in frank ambiguity:", "\u201cNo one knows what would happen if psychiatrists simply let themselves out of their epistemic prison by no longer pretending to know what they can\u2019t know. No one knows what would happen if they simply told you that they don\u2019t know what illness (if any) is causing your anxiety or depression or agitation, and then, if they thought it was warranted, told you there are drugs that might help (although they don\u2019t really know why or at what cost to the brain, or whether you will be able to stop taking them if you want to; nor can they guarantee that you\u2014or your child\u2014won\u2019t become obese or diabetic or die early), and offer you a prescription.\u201d", "That sounds pretty appealing when the examples you use are \u201canxiety or depression or agitation.\u201d In fact, as Greenberg points out a page later, the above conversation is probably the one a lot of family doctors have with their patients when they prescribe antidepressants. But what if the example you use is the autism spectrum, and the patient is a kid? It seems problematic to tell a 10-year-old, or even a 20-year-old, that she", "be on the autism spectrum. Can you imagine taking on adolescence while harboring the knowledge that you", "be socially and/or cognitively impaired? Would you be able to say, \u201cAw hell, this quote-unquote disorder is just an intellectual construct anyway\u201d? That strikes me as a situation in which transparent conjecture might cause substantial harm.", "And besides, a lot of medicine is mysterious, not just psychiatry. Doctors of all kinds are forced to make educated guesses as a matter of routine. They still try to follow an exacting set of common guidelines for treatment. Greenberg anticipates this argument, countering that \u201cpsychiatry, much more than other medical specialties, is still deeply in the debt of ancient medicine.\u201d But he does not address the intrusion of politics and culture on all manner of healthcare. Surely the debate about whether childbirth should be medicalized is a cultural and political one. As is the fight over whether we should consider an ailing 95-year-old \u201csick,\u201d when said 95-year-old demands constant medical attention and a poor 40-year-old can\u2019t afford to see a doctor. If the difference between psychiatry and the rest of medicine is a matter of the", "of uncertainty, is psychiatry really trapped in its own \u201cepistemic prison?\u201d", "There is a reasonable case for a psychiatric bible designed to nip protestant speculation in the bud and written in a papal cast of mind.

But perhaps we can save the", "by making its definitions of mental illness stingy enough to encourage reticence. That", "would not be hard science but a set of highly constrictive rules about what you are allowed to prescribe a patient and under what circumstances you\u2019re allowed to evoke a diagnosis.
