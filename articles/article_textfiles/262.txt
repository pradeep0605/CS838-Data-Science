{"Body": ["Nick Drnaso", "Shira Greene, the 44-year-old narrator of Rachel Cantor\u2019s second novel,", ", is not a new character. Since 2006, Cantor has published five short stories about Shira, a writer and translator who lives with her gay best friend, Ahmad, and her 7-year-old daughter, Andi, on the Upper West Side. (", "", "", "are available to read online, in full or in part.)", ", which follows Shira\u2019s efforts to translate a book of poetry by a famous Italian poet in 1999,", "began as another story before swelling to a novella and then a novel.

Anderson is a", "associate editor.", "This fact\u2014which I discovered only after finishing", "\u2014might explain my impression while reading that Cantor was taking my interest in Shira\u2019s life for granted. If I already knew and loved Shira and the other characters in her universe\u2014Ahmad, the Pakistani professor whose wife and sons broke off contact with him after he came out; Jeanette, the bawdy real estate agent who gives Shira advice on dating and lingerie; Benny, the menschy rabbi and lit-mag editor who owns a bookstore across the street from Shira and Ahmad\u2019s apartment\u2014maybe reading", "would have felt like settling comfortably into a familiar armchair.", "But on its own,", "is hard to get into. Not because the novel combines commentary on Dante\u2019s early text", ", exposition on translation theory, multifaceted interpretations of the Song of Solomon, and several offhand references to the German poet Paul Celan. Nor because of the fairly outlandish plot twist that begins to emerge about halfway through; it\u2019s easy enough to suspend your disbelief for a writer as ebullient and fanciful as Cantor. No, my main issue with", "has to do with Shira, whose navel-gazing began to wear on me and whose narration is too blinkered to give the plot any semblance of momentum.", "At the opening of", ", Shira, who abandoned her dissertation on Dante years ago and now temps for prosthetic leg companies and fragrance manufacturers, receives a telegram from Romei, a Nobel Prize\u2013winning Romanian-Italian poet, asking her to translate his latest work into English. At first, Shira thinks one of her ex-boyfriends is playing a prank on her, but she eventually realizes this is the real Romei, who has read Shira\u2019s translation of Dante\u2019s", "and is apparently impressed by her abilities. As Romei\u2019s book, which tells the story of how he met his wife, Esther, trickles in via fax, Shira notices deliberate tricks and traps\u2014false cognates, syllepses, paronomasia\u2014that seem intended to trip up a translator. Meanwhile, the life she has built with Ahmad, whose name appears on Andi\u2019s birth certificate even though he\u2019s not her biological father, begins to fray as Shira gets closer and closer to the kindhearted Benny.", "The story-within-a-story device means that most of the suspense of", "comes from Romei\u2019s slowly unspooling book and its attendant mysteries: Why does the text seem deliberately difficult to translate? Why do the sections he faxes to Shira seem to allude to old stories and essays of Shira\u2019s? Why did Romei choose Shira, anyway? Unfortunately, Cantor squanders many opportunities to play up the suspense, as when Shira tells instead of showing us that Romei\u2019s pages contain \u201cseven images and ideas familiar from my stories.\u201d Plus, small inconsistencies emerge: Shira is hypersensitive to the nuances of Romei\u2019s text, but she seems altogether too na\u00efve about the personal questions Romei asks her during phone calls. And Cantor breezes through the exposition about how Romei found Shira so quickly that later on, when Shira has an epiphany about Romei\u2019s path to her, I was just confused.", "Shira\u2019s real-life concerns are equally prone to narrative bumpiness. When Ahmad announces, out of the blue, that he wants to move from Manhattan to Connecticut, he suddenly morphs from supportive best friend to cruel, arbitrary oppressor. Neither Ahmad\u2019s insistence on the move, nor Shira\u2019s violent opposition to it, are ever fully explained. Ahmad and Shira\u2019s backstory\u2014they attended high school together in Rome, and their pasts are haunted by two absentee love-interest figures, Jonah and T.\u2014is needlessly convoluted, but it doesn\u2019t begin to explain the enmity they display during their geographical battle. Rather, it feels like Ahmad turns on Shira simply because Cantor needed to come up with a conflict to bring Shira\u2019s demons to a head.", "Bennett Beckenstein", "The conflict between Ahmad and Shira isn\u2019t merely contrived; it also makes both characters insufferable. The previously harmonious mother and father play tug-of-war over their daughter, and each commits unforgivable parenting sins in the process. It\u2019s hard to focus on Shira\u2019s budding romance with Benny, and the enigma of Romei\u2019s text, when Shira and Ahmad are trading insults and taking turns isolating Andi from the other. When Shira casually disabuses Andi of the notion that Ahmad is her real father in an attempt to win her over, whatever empathy I\u2019d felt for Shira more or less ran out.", "If you\u2019re generous enough to look past Shira\u2019s terrible parenting, you\u2019ll find some unique pleasures in", ". Cantor\u2019s depiction of the coffee shops, bookstores, and parks of the Upper West Side in the late 1990s is richly textured and realistic. Cantor\u2019s gift with wordplay imbues the book with energy; Shira brims with inspired coinages like \u201cCohn\u2019s Cones koans\u201d (Zen riddles about a local ice cream shop). And, not insignificantly,", "is a genuinely useful primer on the inherent challenges of translating poetry. Cantor drops useful tidbits like the fact that \u201cItalian condenses at the rate of four English feet per line\u201d and defines the Buber-Rosensweig approach to translation\u2014always translating the same word the same way, so that words echo the way they were intended to. Shira\u2019s project is an investigation into whether translation is really possible\u2014whether a translator can ever truly capture the meaning and spirit of an original text\u2014and Cantor elucidates this philosophical question masterfully.", "Early on in", ", Shira tells us,", "A similar intimacy, of course, exists between writer and reader.
