But once they\u2019ve accepted that the cause is supernatural, they call in an expert to help them get rid of it: if not an outright exorcist, then a ghost hunter using similar techniques, like Ed and Lorraine Warren, a real-life couple whose exploits have been turned into best-selling books and films from", "to", ".", "For a nation that\u2019s only", ", America sure is fascinated by exorcism. Still, there\u2019s a glaring absence in most demonic possession stories\u2014and in fact in most supernatural yarns where vampires and other monsters recoil from crucifixes and holy water.
