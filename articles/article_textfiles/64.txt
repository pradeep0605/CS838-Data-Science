I\u2019ve gone everywhere and everywhen I can think of.\u201d The gull explains that, in addition to inventing brand new words, those who pursue perfection \u201cgo anywhere, instantly. Remember, Jonathan, heaven isn\u2019t a place or a time, because place and time are so very meaningless.\u201d This is spiritual gobbledygook for the", "crowd, the flat rejection of all that is accepted and known for the supermystical, groovy promise of the murky unknown.", "Bach\u2019s Chauncey Gardner\u2013style idiot savant mojo didn\u2019t reach full bloom until JLS became a", "with", ".

It\u2019s central to JLS\u2019s message, and plays a part in most of Bach\u2019s countless books, from the best-seller", "to the less-known", ". \u201cHe spoke of very simple things,\u201d Bach writes of a seagull disciple named Fletcher in JLS, \u201cthat it is right for a gull to fly, that freedom is the very nature of his being, that whatever stands against that freedom must be set aside, be it ritual or superstition or limitation in any form.\u201d", "With these words, Bach unknowingly rode the crest of a wave of simpleton wisdom, part of a rising tide that eventually included Pink Floyd lyrics, Subaru ads, Lady Gaga pull quotes, and the pre-Iraqi-invasion speeches of President George W. Bush. The basic idea? Freedom is good, dude, and the stuff that stands in the way of freedom\u2014whether it be dismissive flock elders, mean school teachers, emotionally distant mothers, bad boyfriends, or sovereign nations with crappy attitudes\u2014should be banished forever. \u201cSet aside, even if it be the Law of the Flock?\u201d a member of the flock asks.

Reading Bach\u2019s novella can feel like pinpointing the exact moment in American history when our disillusionment and outrage at society\u2019s massive, grand-scale failures yielded to a new kind of personal arrogance, a championing of the individual over the group no matter the cost. Capitalism and the so-called \u201cnatural\u201d laws of individualism bled into every dimension of the culture\u2014sports, the self-help movement, overachievement parenting, Wall Street\u2014and were elevated to the realm of higher law, unquestioned and trusted.

This, after all, is the allure and the danger of simpleton wisdom: It bypasses the challenges of coexisting with others in a diverse community in favor of pretty pictures, facile promises, and magic. Part 4 of Bach\u2019s book, which decries religion\u2019s status symbols and idol worship, feels like a logical extension of the author\u2019s original clumsy, overbroad message. \u201cIn less than two hundred years nearly every element of Jonathan\u2019s teaching was taken out of daily practice by the simple pronouncement that it was Holy, and beyond the aspiration of common gulls, lower-than-sandfleas,\u201d Bach writes. \u201cIn time, the rites and ceremonies that were planted around the name of Jonathan Seagull became obsessive.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s lessons have been distorted, reduced to \u201cthe ceremony and superstition of those who preferred excuses for failure instead of hard work and greatness.\u201d Once again, Bach offers reductive dichotomies in the place of real insights or wisdom.

We should, instead, recognize Bach\u2019s book as a harbinger not just of the glut of simpleton wisdom that came to crowd out worthier entries on the nonfiction best-seller list over the last 40 years, but of the rise of simpleton culture at large, which so often shuns complexity for easy answers and empty slogans.", "Of course, easy answers and empty slogans do seem to reign everywhere and everywhen.
