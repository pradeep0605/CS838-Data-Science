{"Body": ["Illustration By Nicole Georges", "Because poetry\u2019s medium is a single human voice, it\u2019s an ideal vehicle for human mastery, a source of awe at the almost athletic ingenuity of saying something rhythmically and well. Or: Because poetry\u2019s medium is a single human voice, it\u2019s an ideal image of our human frailty\u2014its serrated right margin pointing out that the page is still mostly blank, that a larger silence surrounds our speech. And: Sometimes a poet manages both, suggesting that even the most unmanageable truths are amenable to our activity, making even absence shapely, present, shareable, right.", "Marcus Wicker\u2019s debut collection,", ", falls into that final category. It's hip-deep in pop culture\u2019s energy, but it\u2019s also, and often at the same time, a reminder of the loneliness all our culture, pop and not, has in trust. You can hear that combination in the conclusion of his poem \u201cLove Letter to RuPaul,\u201d one of several love letters to pop icons, all of them emphasizing race and masculinity, most of them flat-out amazing. Here, Wicker is describing \u201cone of my earliest memories,\u201d a burger ad starring RuPaul. Notice how bare the last two incomplete sentences seem:", "\u2026that commercial", "ravished me. How hard, to be sandwiched", "between what and who you are, tickled", "by every cruel wind, critic-voyeur", "playing rough beneath your skirt. How", "raw you must be. To sit before a camera,", "legs uncrossed.", "", "\"Raw\" is right. In both sound and sense, Wicker nails the terrible courage of standing out and dignifies it with an abrupt austerity.", "That's not to say that", "is perfect. The book\u2014which D.A. Powell chose for the National Poetry Series, an annual contest in which five prominent poets choose books for five presses\u2014includes some poems that seem to exhibit too much faith that writing a poem is inherently worthwhile and others that too readily take up an opposite position: Interrupting himself with skepticism about what he\u2019s up to, Wicker sets up an artistic cul-de-sac that\u2019s frustratingly prevalent in contemporary verse.", "But those are small sins, and common ones as well. It\u2019s", "'s strengths that are uncommon, and they define the majority of this book. Wicker captures pop culture\u2019s abundance\u2014in particular the hurry and wit of hip-hop and slam\u2014without pop\u2019s blind timeliness. He also fuses hip-hop\u2019s restless dexterity, its as-if-improvised fusion of amazement and momentum and force, with an ability to reward the less purely propulsive experience of reading on the page.", "That double value shows up in another of Wicker's love letters, this one to Dave Chappelle:", "This isn't a poem", "about some cowboy cracking up", "over a blackface skit. How his cackle", "sounded like a bigot's brain", "lodged inside a beating heart, thinking", "out loud.", "", "You can hear the same rhythmic extravagance that shows up in some hip-hop, the eagerness to almost overwhelm an audience with ingenuity. Imagine drawing lines between all the words that seem to be echoing each other through, for instance, alliteration (", "owboy,", "ra", "ing, bla", "face, s", "it,", "a", "le, li", "e, thin", "ing;", "lackface,", "igot,", "rain,", "eating; etc.), and imagine trying to account for all the overlaps and variations in those. Listen to the places where the stressed syllables pile up, loosen, then pile up again. Notice the way he establishes a pattern of \"a,\" followed by a descriptor beginning with", ", and then a noun (and the way that \"bigot's brain\" throws in an extra", ").", "Listening to something this agile, you're meant to feel your mind racing to keep up. You're meant to marvel, humbled and amazed. And yet Wicker's own humility leaves plenty of room for intimacy and contemplation, too\u2014including, in this poem, contemplation of the ways that black culture gets used in the larger, whiter world (a subject Wicker will later take up in regards to his own standing as a poet). And if the almost-too-much of the excerpt's rhythm foreshadows Chappelle's eventual breakdown, the poem's thinking also foregrounds a compassion that takes that person more seriously than the cultural chaos that overwhelms him.", "Wicker's style and success serve as a reminder that we don't need to reject world and world's delights to think about both critically. Here, for example, is another ending, this one from \u201cEverything I Know About Jazz I Learned from Kenny G.\u201d The prose poem opens with Wicker\u2019s father discovering his eighth-grade son listening to the poem\u2019s titular lightweight, then dragging him downstairs to the father\u2019s collection of", "jazz. Wicker concludes the scene many hours later:", "It sounds like a welted voice wincing at the basement\u2019s night. A voice my father hears too.", "He does not cave the basement door. He walks a dirge down those steps. Gently strokes my neck. Asks, Why are you crying, son? Dad, I ache. Because I\u2019ve been down here forever.", "", "Photo by Donald Adiska.", "Clearly, Wicker\u2019s putting on a show\u2014\u201ca welted voice wincing at the basement\u2019s night\u201d almost winks with pleasure, even as it describes a wounded state\u2014but it\u2019s a damned good show, and one that, in numerous poems, pushes us to stay aware of the ways our shows are manufactured and what they ask us to believe. Wicker does this without ever suggesting superiority to showmen, though. His writing is full of love for the songs and artists he invokes.", "And that\u2019s another thing that makes", "so worthwhile: In spite of its title, it seeks (and finds) real delight, giddy with the joy of making language mean and sing, sound and sense and allusion all but falling over each other as they run.

Wicker writes poems whose timely pleasures keep verging on timeless sorrows, and where the social issues of our time persistently evoke enduring human need. In the process, he captures the odd ways that our larger-than-life moment lives inside our pending irrelevance\u2014and the compassion such knowledge allows. \"I'm wondering if a face on fire/ looks the same in any city.
