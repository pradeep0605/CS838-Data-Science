{"Body": ["Illustration by Roman Muradov", "Getting close to Kim Gordon, during her 30-year career in Sonic Youth, never felt easy. She was cool, in both an aesthetic sense and an emotional one. She seemed tough in general\u2014tough to talk to, tough to decode. Onstage, Gordon was restrained, in sharp contrast to Thurston Moore\u2019s showy guitar theatrics. I still vividly remember a Sonic Youth concert I saw 20 years ago, and how Gordon stood completely still, firing her vocals at the audience in a staccato monotone, like she was tapping in Morse code. The one time I interviewed her, in 2004, she seemed icy and withdrawn.", "\u201cOnstage, people have told me, I\u2019m opaque or mysterious or enigmatic or even cold,\u201d Gordon writes in her impressive and revealing new memoir,", ". \u201cBut more than any of those things, I\u2019m extremely shy and sensitive, as if I can feel all the emotions swirling around a room. And believe me when I say that once you push past my persona, there aren\u2019t any defenses there at all.\u201d", "\u201cI had no choice but to turn fearless.\u201d", "begins and ends with the slow-motion collapse of Gordon\u2019s 27-year marriage to Thurston Moore. In the first chapter, darkly titled \u201cThe End,\u201d chronicling Sonic Youth\u2019s final tour in 2011, she characterizes Moore as a big, overgrown kid. \u201cThurston double-slapped our bass guitarist Mark Ibold on the shoulder and loped across the stage,\u201d she writes about their final show. \u201cI found that gesture so phony, so childish, such a fantasy.\u201d\u00a0 In a damning chapter near the end of the book detailing Moore\u2019s infidelity, and the ugly fallout of their marriage, she writes that Moore \u201cseemed lost in his own weather pattern, his own season,\u201d tapping madly on an iPhone, presumably to his new lover, and speaking awkwardly in a \u201cbig captain\u2019s voice.\u201d\u00a0 Life with Moore, Gordon recounts, became \u201ca pattern of lies, ultimatums, and phony promises, followed by e-mails and texts that almost felt designed to be stumbled on so as to force me to make a decision that he, Thurston, was too much of a coward to face.\u201d", "When Gordon and Moore\u2019s split was publicly announced in 2011, the tectonic plates of rock and roll seemed to shift. To many fans, their separation felt wrong in some grand, cosmic sense. Gordon\u2019s discovery of the affair through text messages on Moore\u2019s iPhone seemed so impossibly sad and real and dull\u2014an ordinary soap-opera breakup for an extraordinary couple, and an extraordinary band. The responses on social media were operatic, but Gordon\u2019s description is clinical, even brutal in its efficiency: \u201cMarriage is a long conversation, someone once said, and maybe so is a rock band\u2019s life. A few minutes later, both were done.\u201d", "Gordon begins with this breakup story, but soon launches into a much more interesting narrative\u2014the story of her own life. The early days of Sonic Youth, the longstanding friendships with artists like Dan Graham: These are stories she tells with a matter-of-fact air, dryly reeling out lines like \u201cOnce when Sonic Youth was on tour in Lawrence, Kansas, opening for R.E.M., Thurston and I paid a visit to William Burroughs. ... That day, all I could think of was how much Burroughs reminded me of my dad.\u201d", "Gordon\u2019s spare, unadorned writing style makes the occasional flourishes stand out. The descriptions of New York City, where she first moved in 1980, are poetic and memorable. \u201cWhen I first drove down the Hudson Parkway it was bumpy and nerve-wracking, as if your car were being shot from a pinball machine down a slope into some rough forest,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was all unknown and possibility.\u201d Writing about New York, as Gordon explains, isn\u2019t easy. \u201cNot because memories intersect and overlap, because of course they do,\u201d she writes. \u201cNot because incidents and times mix with others, because that happens too. Not because I didn\u2019t fall in love with New York, because even though I was lonely and poor, no place had ever made me feel more at home. It is because knowing what I know now, it\u2019s hard to write about a love story with a broken heart.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine to whom else she refers.", "Gordon\u2019s characterizations of the other men in her life are much more fully formed than her representation of Moore. As a child growing up in Los Angeles, she looked up to her older brother Keller, but he teased her viciously, and fought with her constantly. His behavior became increasingly erratic: \u201cAt some point, while living in Malibu, my brother started dressing entirely in white,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe grew a long beard and carried a Bible, not for any religious reason, he\u2019d say if anyone asked, but more for its literary excellence. He began making up words, his own private alphabet and language.\u201d", "Keller, who was institutionalized, was \u201cthe person who more than anyone else in the world shaped who I was, and who I turned out to be,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe was, and still is, brilliant, manipulative, sadistic, arrogant, almost unbearably articulate. He\u2019s also mentally ill, a paranoid schizophrenic. And maybe because he was so incessantly verbal from the start, I turned into his opposite, his shadow\u2014shy, sensitive, closed to the point where to overcome my own hypersensitivity, I had no choice but to turn fearless.\u201d", "Her friendship with Kurt Cobain also went deep. She\u2019ll always remember his \u201csmallness, his thinness, the frail appearance, like an old man, with those big, illuminated, innocent, childish, saucer-sized eyes like ringed planets,\u201d she writes. She has nothing but harsh words for Courtney Love, though. She depicts her as a manipulative narcissist with an underlying \u201cdisorder behind her tarantula L.A. glamour.\u201d She also has nothing nice to say about their short marriage, sighing: \u201cIt takes so little time to forge a life, or in this case, a brand.\u201d", "Photo courtesy Alisa Smirnova", "There is so much that Kim Gordon seems to loathe, or at least be annoyed by, in this book\u2014Lana Del Rey, Moore\u2019s new partner, Billy Corgan, the shiny new New York\u2014that you begin to wonder: What does Kim Gordon like? What does she love? Her descriptions of the people closest to her often seem cool and detached, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to grasp the passion underneath. A description of the life and tragic death of her longtime friend, the artist Mike Kelley, reads almost like a newspaper article. It\u2019s probably\u2014quite understandably\u2014too painful to express in words, but sometimes the book feels as though she wrote it in shorthand: a list of names with the sentences barely filled in, as if we should already know the story.", "She discusses her long history in Sonic Youth mainly through describing various songs. \u201cI could barely hold it together during our first song, \u2018", ",\u2019\u201d she writes of Sonic Youth\u2019s uncomfortable final tour. \u201cAt one point my voice fell like it was scraping against its own bottom, and then the bottom fell out.\u201d The song, as many Sonic Youth fans know, is one of the high points of the group\u2019s 1985 album", "; Gordon wrote the lyrics in a tenement apartment on Eldridge Street in New York, where she was living with Moore. To a reader familiar with Sonic Youth\u2019s music, the song, referencing the stoic women in Gordon\u2019s own family, feels charged with meaning, but this is one of many points in", "where a non-fan could feel lost.", "feels appealingly rough around the edges; the rare window it offers into Gordon\u2019s life leaves the reader with a more nuanced perspective. There are reasons for the cool distance she injects between herself and the crowd. \u201cThe rock star thing has always felt dishonest to me\u2014stylized and gestural, even goofy,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt uncomfortable giving people what they want or expect.\u201d", "---", "by Kim Gordon.
