She values her privacy and hates the social circus of the literary world. But she has also gestured toward a belief that her \u201cabsence\u201d adds a layer to her art. (Ferrante rejects the description of herself as \u201canonymous\u201d because her books are signed, though with a fabricated name.) As", ", \u201cIf the author doesn\u2019t exist outside the text, inside the text she offers herself,", "to the story, exerting herself to be truer than she could be in the photos of a Sunday supplement, at a book launch, at a literary festival, in some television broadcast, receiving a literary prize.\u201d In an email exchange with the", ", she", ": \u201cThe structural absence of the author affects the writing in a way that I\u2019d like to continue to explore.\u201d", "Now, we may have gained a key to exactly what Ferrante means from an unexpected source:", "she wrote for a Folio Society edition of Jane Austen\u2019s", ". When Ferrante fell in love with Austen\u2019s novels in her 20s, she writes, \u201cI was passionate about her anonymity.\u201d The original readers of", "were told only that it was \u201cby a lady.\u201d Which leads to the central, somewhat magical question of Ferrante\u2019s short piece: \u201cWho wrote", "? \u2026 Was it\u00a0Jane Austen or, simply, a lady?\u201d", "\u201cThe lightness conceals pitiless depths\u2014it\u2019s a glaze that, miraculously, doesn\u2019t sweeten anything.\u201d", "Ferrante answers by examining the novel\u2019s heroine, Elinor, whom she argues has both \u201csense\u201d\u2014prudence\u2014and \u201csensibility\u201d\u2014passion. When Elinor\u2019s sister (and some readers) accuse her of being without sensibility, they have misunderstood the way she channels herself into observation rather than ego. She intentionally reins in the uglier emotions that swirl around female competition for husbands and status, even as she, too, \u201cwants love \u2026 aspires to happiness and happiness is marriage.\u201d Ferrante describes the outcome of this self-control as a virtuous self-effacement: \u201cElinor hides Elinor in order to become better than Elinor.\u201d", "Austen, Ferrante tells us, accomplished the same impossible balancing act. By writing anonymously, she created a \u201clady-narrator\u201d who is both a part of the world of women she describes\u2014elegant and educated yet utterly powerless, vying for the husbands on whom their futures depend\u2014and a dispassionate observer of that world. And this, Ferrante suggests in a sentence that could describe her own work as easily as Austen\u2019s, gives her the power to write with a tonal deftness that lifts her material to the level of art: \u201cThe lady-who-writes can set aside dissatisfaction and bitterness, spread a light, ironic glaze over the old world that, with its wrongs, is collapsing and the new world that is emerging, with its abundance of new wrongs. But pay attention, for the lightness conceals pitiless depths\u2014it\u2019s a glaze that, miraculously, doesn\u2019t sweeten anything.\u201d", "The Neapolitan novels contain this same \u201clight, ironic glaze\u201d over \u201cpitiless depths.\u201d Consider the condition that plagues the character Raffaella Cerullo (called Lila), which she refers to as \u201cdissolving margins\u201d: \u201c[T]he outlines of people and things suddenly dissolved, disappeared \u2026 she had perceived for the first time unknown entities that broke down the outline of the world and demonstrated its terrifying nature.\u201d", "Lila\u2019s episodes can be read as both a mysterious nervous condition and a profound insight into the nature of her rapidly shifting 20", "-century world. Ferrante explores them through the lens of her narrator, Lila\u2019s friend Elena Greco, who in turn sees them through the refractions of her endlessly complex\u2014and envious\u2014fascination with her counterpart. This distance enables both Elenas to write about the theme of \u201cdissolving margins\u201d in a way that is never overwrought, but instead penetratingly precise\u2014revealing a problem that is metaphysical rather than sentimental.", "The need to create a more capacious authorial persona is, Ferrante implies, especially urgent for female writers. At the beginning of the introduction, she admits that as a teenager, she didn\u2019t care for Austen. \u201cI was enthralled by the great male adventure novels, with their stories that ranged all over the world, and I wanted to write such books myself: I couldn\u2019t resign myself to the idea that women\u2019s novels were domestic tales of love and marriage.\u201d Ferrante\u2019s own heroines do travel, and engage in the highest order of political and intellectual disputes\u2014Lila and Elena are swept up in the socialist protests of 1968, and in the early days of the feminist movement. But their dramas are also, essentially, domestic. Like Austen\u2019s novels, Ferrante\u2019s are, on at least one fundamental level, a study of good and bad marriages and how they determine women\u2019s fates. She gives her characters\u2019 lives, and their interior selves, the exigency of an adventure story by writing about them with a corresponding velocity.", "Ferrante suggests that for Austen to accomplish this, she had to invent a version of her own consciousness that transcended the limitations of her life as a woman born in the 18", "century; Austen could not write with \u201ca clear gaze\u201d about her social confinements while trapped within them. A woman like Austen\u2014and perhaps, for all we know, like Ferrante, too\u2014was probably forced to steal time to write in \u201ca common room, a space not hers,\u201d and to \u201chide her pages\u201d whenever someone came in. Ferrante describes the lady-writer flickering into being in the brief moments when Austen felt free, disappearing at the first threat from \u201cthe disorderly world of the everyday\u201d\u2014the real life of the real and limited Jane.", "", "Nora Caplan-Bricker is a contributing writer for", ".
