{"Body": ["Manchul Kim", "For a reader who wants most of all to get lost in a book, the difficulty of reading short story collections is that every several pages she and the author must dissolve the world they\u2019ve summoned up together and start anew. Fictional beginnings are always an uphill climb, requiring a push from the reader until her imagination meshes with the words and then the words fall away and the reading coasts along on pure momentum. Even when a short story achieves that frictionless delight\u2014and not many do\u2014the glide doesn\u2019t last long. Soon the end arrives, and then the climbing commences again. This is one reason why millions of readers will gobble up 1,000-page novels set in an imaginary kingdom but still regard slim collections of literary short stories as too much work.", "Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for", "and the author of", ".", ".", "", "The most gifted writers\u2014and the precocious British author Helen Oyeyemi, barely into her 30s with five novels and two plays to her name, is one of them\u2014have their tricks for conquering this inertia, and some of the best tricks are old ones. Oyeyemi\u2019s new short story collection,", "contains nine tales, the first of which begins, \u201cOnce upon a time in Catalonia a baby was found in a chapel.\u201d Hardly innovative, those familiar four words followed by that mysterious foundling, but there\u2019s a reason why old wives have been using such devices for centuries: They work. Then there\u2019s the utter confidence of Oyeyemi\u2019s voice and the way it dips into a conversational mode every now and then to make you feel as if you\u2019ve been waved into a gossipy circle to get the real lowdown. \u201cHer taste lacked refinement,\u201d she remarks of the foundling, now grown into a laundress named Montserrat. \u201cHer greatest material treasure was an egregiously shiny bit of tin she\u2019d won at a fairground coconut shy; this fact can\u2019t be denied.\u201d", "When Montserrat becomes fascinated by the artist who lives above the laundry, she sneaks upstairs to watch the other woman at her easel: \u201cMontse saw that the Se\u00f1ora sometimes grew short of breath though she\u2019d hardly stirred. A consequence of snatching images out of the air \u2014 the air took something back.\u201d Yes, Oyeyemi has her flashes of lyricism, but they\u2019re so fleeting that they leave you refreshed and yearning rather than drenched in verbiage; her stories are never mere set pieces for the display of exquisite prose. Each woman, Montserrat and the Se\u00f1ora, wears a key on a chain around her neck, but only one of the two knows which lock hers is meant for. This first story, \u201cBooks and Roses,\u201d transpires in a slightly fabulist Spain, a place out of a sumptuous old Marlene Dietrich movie, complete with professional gamblers, lady pickpockets, climbing roses, lonely mountains, and doomed lovers.", "There\u2019s a reason why old wives have been using such devices for centuries: They work.", "Most of the rest of the stories in", "are linked, with major characters in one story later turning up as minor characters in another. This loose, multiracial, polymorphously perverse, generation-spanning cast lives mostly in present-day England, but they have roots elsewhere. Anton grew up in \u201ca country that\u2019s not even sure it\u2019s really a country,\u201d a \u201cridiculous place\u201d where \u201cevery day there was news that made you say, \u2018Oh really.\u2019 Some new tax that only people with no money had to pay. Or yet another member of the county police force was found to be an undercover gangster. If not that then a gang member was found to be an undercover police officer.\u201d Others feel insufficiently anchored where they were born. Teenaged Radha, so tongue-tied she can speak freely only to her big brother and the companionable ghost in her bedroom, is dragged by her brother to a party. There she meets and is smitten by the alluring Myrna Semyonova, whose family runs a very odd puppeteering school. Part of Radha\u2019s story, unfolding in the longest and most complex piece in the book, is narrated by one of the puppets.", "Freddie Barrandov\u2014whose parents emigrated from a country where his father was arrested for \u201crepairing the faces of broken clock towers without authorization\u201d\u2014wants to teach nursery school, but his family insists that he go to work at the Hotel Glissando. I, for one, would read a dozen stories set in this establishment, where \u201cthe furnishings are a mixture of dark reds and deep purples. Moving through the lobby is like crushing grapes and plums and being bathed in the resulting wine. There are three telephone booths in the lobby. Their numbers are automatically withheld and they\u2019re mainly used for lies.\u201d The clientele flits tantalizingly through Freddie\u2019s narrative, suggesting a feast of intriguing tales that Oyeyemi may never get around to telling. So many short stories feel starved of plot, but hers brim with it.", "This is a world in which a young girl\u2019s fall from innocence via a nasty YouTube expos\u00e9 of her favorite pop star finds succor in an invocation of Hecate\u2014the three-faced Greek goddess of crossroads, portals, and witchcraft\u2014whose curse hounds the singer-songwriter into true repentance. Oyeyemi, who was born and spent the first four years of her life in Nigeria, makes allusions to Henry James and", "and her stories will remind some readers of those of Kelly Link and Angela Carter. But her buoyant embrace of the multicultural milieu her characters inhabit also recalls the joyousness of early Zadie Smith, especially", "Hers is a vision where identity matters, but it doesn\u2019t trump everything. What has the power to transcend it is love and literature.", "In \u201cA Brief History of the Homely Wench Society,\u201d Dayang (Anton\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s daughter), joins the eponymous Cambridge University social club. The Homely Wench Society forms in 1949 to prank and chasten the all-male Bettencourt Society, which holds an annual party in its London townhouse to which only extremely pretty girls are invited.

The Wenches summarize their new ethos as \u201claughs, snacks and cotching [hanging out],\u201d but they still regard the Bettencourters as their natural enemies, which makes it all the more troubling that two of the Wenches find two of the Bettencourters so attractive.", "Keys, locks, and doorways feature in all of the stories in", "and this one is no different. Having obtained the key code to the Bettencourt townhouse, the Wenches infiltrate in the dead of night to sabotage the bookshelves, which they correctly anticipate to contain works almost entirely by male authors. These they swap for books by women and wait for the boys to notice. The effects of the escapade prove unpredictable, though; the Wenches end up being impressed with their purloined male-written volumes. \u201cThey have good taste, though,\u201d admits one member grudgingly. \u201cI want to read everything,\u201d is how Dayang puts it, expressing what feels like Oyeyemi\u2019s credo. \u201cWhen it comes to books and who can put things in them and get things out of them, it\u2019s all ours. And all theirs, too.\u201d", "In a", ", Oyeyemi remarked that when it comes to writing, she feels that she\u2019s still \u201cvery much learning on the job.\u201d (If so, given the effortless authority of these stories, look out.) \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that I know how to write,\u201d Oyeyemi explained. \u201cI'm very confident that I can read. I feel like I'm such a good reader.\u201d That makes sense, and it also illuminates how What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours escapes the chorelike quality that has come to be associated with the average contemporary short story collection.
