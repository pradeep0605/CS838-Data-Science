Really?", "David Haglund is the literary editor of NewYorker.com.", "There\u2019s the question of tone, and then there\u2019s another, I think more significant, matter: The most evident meaning of this heavy-handed play on words is \u201cLet me, Richard Ford, be Frank Bascombe with you, the reader.\u201d And that meaning puts front and center a question that has become more pressing as Bascombe has pushed on across the decades: What is the difference, finally, between Ford and Frank? There are some plain biographical distinctions\u2014as well as many biographical similarities\u2014but how much discernible distance is there between author and character? How much more does Ford see than Frank does, and how differently does he see things? In his review of", "", ", A.O. Scott said that \u201cit can feel, writing about these books, that you are not evaluating a literary artifact so much as passing judgment on a person,\u201d adding that \u201cFrank is, more or less officially, a nice guy, but I\u2019m not always sure I like him.\u201d I agree with the first part of that: Writing about the Bascombe books does feel a bit like judging a person rather than a thing\u2014and that\u2019s very much to the books\u2019 credit. But as nice as Frank might mostly be, he is not merely occasionally \u201cannoying,\u201d as Scott suggests a sentence later, or just intermittently unlikable. Whatever this might mean for the literary value of the Bascombe books, Frank is kind of an asshole.", "Not an egregious one, I don\u2019t think\u2014not much more of one than me, perhaps. (But a little bit more of one, I hope.) And, crucially, Bascombe is capable of", "being an asshole at any given moment. \u201cI think of characters,\u201d Ford", "in 1996, \u201cas being rather", "fixed. I think of them as changeable, provisional, unpredictable, decidedly unwhole.\u201d Ford not only thinks of them that way; with Bascombe, he\u2019s managed to write a character who feels that way\u2014and who therefore feels far more real, more like a flesh-and-blood person, than most fictional characters do. This is the thing that grabbed me about", "when I first read it a little over a decade ago. (That and Ford\u2019s sentences, which bounce between high and low diction in pleasurable, unpredictable ways.) Ford captures the slipperiness of thought in a manner that seems unusually true to the way minds actually work. Frank is not exactly reliable, but he\u2019s not exactly unreliable, either. He may fit certain categories\u2014he definitely fits certain categories, about which more in a moment\u2014but he is not a type.", "Frank was once a writer of fiction\u2014he published a book of stories, \u201cthere were some good notices\u201d\u2014but by the time we meet him in", ", he\u2019s given up that gig, accepting a job \u201cwith a glossy New York sports magazine you\u2019ve all heard of.\u201d When", "opens, we learn that he\u2019s dropped writing altogether and become a real-estate agent. Frank thus has the way with words and the tendency toward introspection you might expect from someone who once wrote short stories for a living, but he lacks the artistic ambitions that might give his life a more straightforward purpose\u2014making him, I\u2019d say, more like other people. He lives, as a much-quoted", "line has it, \u201cthe normal applauseless life of us all.\u201d", "But he is not like everyone: He is, very specifically, a straight, white, middle-class American man who was born in Mississippi in 1945, went to college in Michigan, and settled in New Jersey.

And part of Frank Bascombe\u2019s history is that he\u2019s a white guy, from Mississippi, who was born in the middle of the 1940s, and is maybe a little bit racist.", "This is where we get to the asshole part, and to that question of distance between author and character.", "is made up of four linked novellas, all set shortly after Hurricane Sandy has ravaged Bascombe\u2019s adopted home state of New Jersey. He is 68 now and retired and has maybe too much time on his hands. In the second story, \u201cEverything Could Be Worse,\u201d a middle-aged black woman whom Frank doesn\u2019t know shows up on his front stoop. Her name is Charlotte Pines, and she used to live in the house; now she wants to take a look around. This is a fairly common impulse, as Frank knows from his time as a realtor, but Charlotte\u2019s particular wish, he eventually learns, is rooted in a terrible family tragedy. The gradual unfolding of that sad story in front of a stranger feels like familiar fodder for a short story. But it also feels almost incidental to \u201cEverything Could Be Worse,\u201d which is really about Frank\u2019s difficulty talking to a black person.", "In \u201cEverything Could Be Worse,\u201d Ford attempts to plumb the gulf between his quasi-alter ego and a black individual.", "Ford clues us in right away to Frank\u2019s awkwardness: When he first sees the woman, he gives her a \u201cwelcoming \u2018you\u2019re probably not robbing me\u2019 smile.\u201d \u201cBlack people don\u2019t visit in our neighborhood that often,\u201d he thinks, \u201cexcept to read the meter or fix something.\u201d After she\u2019s in his home, and he\u2019s struggling to make conversation, he jogs his brain for a good topic, \u201csomething any two citizens could talk about, any ole time, to mutual profit\u2014our perplexing races notwithstanding.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have much luck\u2014and he seems almost to take pride in accepting the apparently unbridgeable divide between them: He and his wife, Sally, \u201cdon\u2019t show up grinning at", "church on Sunday\u201d\u2014meaning the church that black people in his town attend\u2014\u201cpretending \u2018we belong, since we\u2019re all really the same under the skin.\u2019 Probably we\u2019re not.\u201d So his inability to talk to her is not terribly surprising. \u201cAlmost all conversations between myself and African Americans devolve into this phony, race-neutral natter about making the world a better place,\u201d he says (to us, not her), \u201cwhich we assume we\u2019re doing just by being alive. But it\u2019s idiotic to think the world would be a better place if people barged uninvited into strangers\u2019 homes.\u201d", "This odd story recalls an even odder essay that Ford wrote in 1999 for the", ". He and Stanley Crouch were asked to float a bit down the Mississippi together as Huck and Jim once fictionally did and talk about race in America. Then they would separately write about it. Ford\u2019s piece is fairly bewildering, occasionally tortured, admirably candid,", ". He acknowledges that because being white is regarded as \u201cnormal\u201d in this country, white people are allowed to \u201csuppose race has less to do with us.\u201d He concedes that he doesn\u2019t \u201creally know how to have a genuine conversation about race\u201d and even starts \u201cto sense that a younger white writer could\u2019ve done this better.\u201d He mostly fails to say anything notable to Crouch at all. And he confesses that one of the things he failed to bring up was that as late as the early 1980s he wrote letters to fellow writers in which he used racial slurs. In some old correspondence he had recently rediscovered, \u201cin response to a negative review of my friend\u2019s book written by a famous critic I\u2019d been told was black, I wrote to my friend, \u2018Who\u2019d have thought he was just a nigger?\u2019 \u201d", "Courtesy of Greta Rybus", "Ford was not happy to discover this letter, obviously, and he wrestles, in print for everyone to see, with what it means. But as readers of Ford I think we probably need to wrestle with it some more. That\u2019s what Ford himself seems to be doing in \u201cEverything Could Be Worse\u201d\u2014attempting to plumb the gulf between his quasi-alter ego and a black individual. And what\u2019s frustrating about the story, and perhaps about Frank Bascombe generally at this point, is that Ford seems too forgiving of him, too accepting of his basic decency despite some very particular failings. At the end of \u201cEverything Could Be Worse,\u201d after all of Frank\u2019s fumbling, Charlotte Pines tells him, \u201cI like the way you say things, Mr. Bascombe.\u201d He asks her to call him Frank, and she does. Given Ford\u2019s own closeness to Bascombe as a character, that feels almost self-congratulatory, and not particularly merited by the previous 50 pages.", "The exchange that wraps up the entire collection bothered me more, and in a similar way. In \u201cDeaths of Others,\u201d the fourth story, Frank has gone, reluctantly, to see an old acquaintance named Eddie, who is dying. The conversation becomes unpleasant, and Frank is distracted by the noise of an oil truck outside, driven by fellow Haddam, New Jersey, resident Ezekiel Lewis, \u201ca strapping, smiling, shaved-head, spiritual dynamo,\u201d whose black great-great-grandfather \u201ccame up from Dixie accompanying a stalwart young white seminarian as his valet\u201d and whose father Frank himself once employed. Ford is surely aware that this genealogical setup evokes the long, tortured history of black-white relations in the U.S. from slavery to now. But Frank, it seems, does not feel tortured by it. He is optimistic about how things would go if he had \u201cone black friend in town,\u201d which he does not. \u201cThere\u2019d be plenty of laughing involved,\u201d he says.", "Maybe Frank is kidding himself, and maybe Ford knows it. \u201cWhite southerners all think we \u2018know\u2019 Negroes better than we do or could,\u201d Frank admits, adding: \u201cThey may think they know us, too\u2014with better reason.\u201d And yes, Frank uses", "throughout the Bascombe books. Ford has", ". It\u2019s an oddly stubborn word choice, given that\u2014as the", "confirms and as I think basically everyone knows\u2014", "is \u201cregarded as out of date or even offensive in both British and American English.\u201d Ford\u2019s old boat mate Stanley Crouch made a case for the word", ", and it was once, of course, used with pride\u2014the United Negro College Fund didn\u2019t get around to \u201c", "\u201d until just a few years ago. So perhaps Ford and Frank both consider it, as Frank might say, hunky-dory.", "But back to Ezekiel Lewis. His back and forth with Frank is brief and anodyne, though it\u2019s made sweetly emotional by Ezekiel\u2019s accidental mention of Frank\u2019s long-dead son. Somehow this exchange makes Frank feel that his day, until now going rather badly, has been \u201csaved.\u201d That\u2019s the last word of the book, and it\u2019s hard not to think that Ford intends this salvific epiphany sincerely. It\u2019s also hard not to think that Frank hasn\u2019t quite earned this particular moment of salvation, that his condescending attitude toward Ezekiel Lewis hasn\u2019t really come in for enough implied authorial criticism. This is why the distance between the author and the character matters\u2014because there are moments when the author steps out quietly from behind the character in an effort to make us feel something, even if it\u2019s just a sense of closure, or a small bit of hope. And while I think that Ford intended me to feel both closure and hope when this book ended, they are not what I felt. I felt frustrated that he hadn\u2019t more fully imagined Ezekiel Lewis, and that he had used the character a little too easily to redeem his protagonist from a difficult moment. I felt that if Ford really was being Frank with us, he maybe should have stayed in that difficult moment a little longer.", "---", "by Richard Ford.
