For many men (especially younger ones), \u201cPride\u201d is a calendar entry more than it\u2019s", "an emotion. It\u2019s a long weekend of sweaty parties and blurry brunches; a workout goal and shopping excuse; an almost guaranteed chance to get laid and, of course, an excuse to parade. Still, these gays might argue that the big Sunday march down Fifth Avenue is the place to look for pride; clearly, we have enormous corporations on our side, not to mention politicians, progressive churches, and patriotic civic clubs. Aside from a few drag queens and muscle boys tossed in for old-timey color, the parade displays precisely the \u201cWe\u2019re just like you\u201d image we\u2019ve worked so hard to affect. The parade travels from commercial Midtown to the West Village; one wonders if reversing the traditional route wouldn\u2019t better align with the general push of gay politics for the last 40 years.", "But there\u2019s another Pride march, smaller and unsponsored and far less modern. In the Drag March, a rag-tag procession of queens, leather daddies,", "and their fans traipse from Tompkins Square Park in the East Village to the Stonewall Inn in the West.

To summarize Halperin\u2019s ambitious book is tricky, but think of it as an exploration of the tension between the official Pride Parade, celebrating post-Stonewall gay", ", and the Drag March, celebrating pre-liberation gay", ".", "", "The book was born in a class Halperin offered in 2000 at the University of Michigan, where he is a professor of the history and theory of sexuality. Also called \u201cHow To Be Gay,\u201d that course raised a remarkable furor in conservative circles, stemming from familiar charges that the sly academic was angling to", "into the", ". Of course, this was not the case\u2014at least half of his students were straight women\u2014but the hissy fit was enough to spur the Michigan legislature", "over public-university course listings.", "Not all criticism, however, came from the political right. As Halperin reports in the book, many gay men were also upset by his wish to identify and examine something called the \u201cgay sensibility\u201d in terms of supposedly retrograde obsessions like divas, musical theater, and interior design. Halperin explains why: \u201c[Studying gay male culture] violates, in particular, the official post-Stonewall creed that gay men are no different from anybody else, that sexual object-choice has nothing to do with gender style, that gay sexuality has no relation to femininity, and that homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a culture or a subculture.\u201d Luckily for those of us who already believed in such a thing as a unique gay male culture\u2014 indeed, for those of us who live in it\u2014Halperin plunged ahead, delivering a study that, though uneven as a piece of writing, is a deeply insightful intellectual exercise.", "What", "lacks most is a coherent plan for how to read it.

Halperin has said that the book represents \u201c", "\u201d from a larger, life\u2019s work-sized project, and it shows. But the illuminating vistas Halperin stumbles upon along the way are definitely worth the journey.", "Halperin is at his best when critiquing the current assimilationist model of gay-rights activism, with its denial of any cultural interests or aesthetic points-of-view that hint of femininity or campiness or of the \u201cstereotypically gay.\u201d His cultural history of how this attitude emerged in the 1970s will be surprising to those who view the gay-rights movement as a consistently positive progression; Halperin argues convincingly that as butch masculine styles became ever more mandatory, both for attracting sexual/romantic partners (no femmes, no fats!) as well as earning political credibility, the push toward conformity lead to the \u201ceuthanasia of traditional gay male culture.\u201d", "Warner Bros./Youtube.", "But Halperin has a harder time pinning that gay culture for study. Interestingly, he chooses one small example\u2014", "from Joan Crawford\u2019s 1945", "\u2014from which to tease out all manner of threads. Many do stand up to his tugging: His analysis of the gendered differences between high tragedy and melodrama is particularly compelling, as is his insistence on a style of \u201cgay femininity\u201d that has nothing to do with real women. But others are more problematic.
