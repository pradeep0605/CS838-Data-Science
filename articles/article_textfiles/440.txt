It was All Saints Day, a fact that I later noted in my journal. I was hungry and craved coffee, but first ducked into the Eighth Street Bookshop to inspect the reduced fare on the remainder tables. They held stacks of Evergreen Reviews and obscure translations from Olympia and Grove Press\u2014new scriptures shunned by the populace. I was on the lookout for something I had to have: a book that was more than a book, containing certain signs that might spin me toward an unforeseen path. I was drawn to a striking, remote face\u2014rendered violet on black\u2014on a dust jacket proclaiming its author \u201ca female Genet.\u201d It cost 99 cents, the price of a grilled cheese and coffee at the Waverly Diner, just across Sixth Avenue.

There was no entry for her in the encyclopedia, so I had to piece her together (as I had Genet) through her every syllable, with the understanding that a poet\u2019s memoirs must move through falsehoods in order to unmask the truth.

She cracks her ankle in the process and beneath a myriad of pitiless stars is seemingly helpless. Tiny but tough, she drags herself across the pavement, inching her way toward the road. She is mercifully scooped up by another soul on the lam, a petty thief named Julien. She clocks him and knows he\u2019s done time; he exudes that ex-con scent. They make their way through the bone-chilling night on his motorcycle. Before dawn he lays her child body tenderly in the childbed of a contact. Later she is moved to the upstairs room of a disgruntled and suspicious family, then again to a friend of a friend.

Were they sounder in prison, not having to look over her shoulder? How was it to sleep on the lam, wondering if narrowed eyes revealed soon-to-be open betrayal? Her bum leg is encased in plaster, but even more painful is the startling fact that Julien has cracked open her hustler heart. Her intense longing for him is a kind of jail term of its own. She has no choice but to endure being shifted around.

Trials, missteps, incarcerations, and small joys constitute their story. They are characters from the life of a book that she has written. I pictured her no longer lame but free, in a straight skirt and sleeveless blouse tied above her waistline, with a wisp of chiffon around her throat. She was under 5 feet tall, but she was no trembling waif\u2014more like a stick of dynamite that in exploding might not kill, but would certainly maim. Her ability to size up a situation, to read a john or her lover\u2019s every gesture is profound, her one-liners swift and cutting. \u201cYou wanted to burden me with your love.\u201d She possesses a lively slang of her own\u2014an argot spattered with Latin.", "A female Genet?

As a child of privilege and neglect, she instinctively knew just how to slip into", ", and may have felt a hidden kinship with her subject. She was intelligent, complicated, and passionately drawn to every rung of French culture: an expat darling of the post-Beats and famously adored by Frank O\u2019Hara.

When Louise returned to Paris to marry, Patsy was devastated: She spent much of her life longing for her imagined mother, the true mother of her invented French soul.", "Photo by Lucien Clergue", "Within her fleeting life, Albertine also longed to know the identity of her mother. Born and abandoned in 1937 in Algeria, she was given the name Albertine Damien by Social Services and baptized Anne-Marie when she was adopted. Her origins were always in question, and perhaps only a cluster of DNA samples could have revealed them. Was she the daughter of a teenage Spanish dancer and a sailor? Or was she the illegitimate child of her adoptive father and his Jewish-Algerian maid? Romance and controversy in either case, and a setup for a marginalized existence. She was a precocious little thing and by the merit of her gifts\u2014she excelled in Latin, literature, and the violin\u2014should have experienced a rich musical life and a scholarly education. But a lack of loving protection and a series of wrenching external events twisted her path forever.", "At 10, she was raped by a member of her stepfather\u2019s family. After her attempts to run away, her parents placed her in a girl\u2019s reformatory paradoxically called the Good Shepherd. It was a wretched place where she was humiliated and stripped of her baptismal name of Anne-Marie. At 13 she kept a spiral notebook, a precious record of her perceptive observances: It was confiscated when the lily-of-the-valley perfume she wore was deemed too strong. She was petite and pretty, armed with the discerning wit of Joan of Arc on trial, and she escaped from reform school and slipped into the Paris streets to eventually lead the life of a prostitute and petty thief. At 18 she was arrested, with a female accomplice, for armed robbery and given seven years. Her last stint was four months in 1963 for pilfering a bottle of whiskey. Through it all she wrote: Throughout her adolescence, through love and abandonment, in or out of prison, she wrote.", "Life is often the best movie.
