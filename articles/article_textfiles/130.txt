But it might make you Bob Dylan himself.", "When Bob Dylan arrived in New York on Jan. 24, 1961, he\u00a0was a Woody Guthrie pilgrim. He talked like he came from Oklahoma instead of\u00a0Minnesota and told stories of ramblin\u2019 that would have fit in", ". He sought out the folk singer, who was suffering from\u00a0Huntington\u2019s chorea. On the weekends Dylan would sit by Guthrie\u2019s hospital bed and play him songs.", "The Dylanologists are just as obsessive about Dylan. In the age before digital music, tape collectors strapped audio equipment to their bodies and pursued rare recordings like jewels from the\u00a0Pharaoh's\u00a0tomb.\u00a0Bill Pagel purchased the ticket from Dylan\u2019s prom, his high chair, and ultimately the home in Duluth where Dylan was born.\u00a0Elizabeth Wolfson vacationed to California so she could drive by Dylan\u2019s Malibu home. Security found her wandering the grounds and turned her away. The most famous of the Dylanologists,\u00a0A.J. Weberman, was so consumed with trying to figure out the transcendental message behind Dylan\u2019s music he was caught looking through the singer\u2019s trash.", "John Dickerson's Dylan bookshelf: His favorite books by Bob, about Bob, and by and about Bob.", "Woody Guthrie gave shape to Bob Dylan\u2019s life and gave him an identity. That's a powerful relationship, and it's what makes the Dylan fanatic such an interesting topic. From the 1960s, when Dylan was first called the \u201cvoice of a generation,\u201d he and his music have shaped entire lives. He's not just the guy playing in the background at the deli. He\u2019s soundtracking marriages and inspiring in listeners a deeper understanding of themselves.\u00a0Dylanologists credit Bob for driving them to certain careers or relationships.", "He doesn\u2019t want the credit. Dylan\u2019s career has been propelled by his effort to stay one step ahead of his fans. He shed the protest-singer label almost as fast as they gave it to him, and he\u2019s ditched every category they've tried to put him in ever since. Wherever he is right now, he\u2019s on the run.", "\u201cWhy is my life such a mess?\u201d", "After reading this series of profiles, it's hard not to share Bob Dylan\u2019s feelings about his most devoted fans.\u00a0\u201cGet a life, please,\u201d he told one interviewer about the devotees. \u201cYou're not serving your own life well. You're wasting your life.\" Kinney doesn't make this argument explicitly. His book is not unlike a Bob Dylan song\u2014he paints a picture and then you've got to interpret it yourself\u2014but the conclusion seems plain: The life of the Dylanologist is often a wasted one.", "One woman who hitchhikes from show to show winds up the victim of a serial killer. Another superfan commits suicide. Others become disillusioned and wonder what they did with their lives. \u201cWhy am I such a mess?\u201d asks Charlie Cicirella during a nervous breakdown in line for a Dylan show in December of 2005. \u201cWhy is my life such a mess?\u201d Cicirella tells Kinney that listening to Dylan for the first time \u201cwas the first time he could ever remember not feeling alone.\u201d But what did that inspire him to do? Based on the book, the answer is: Attend lots of Dylan concerts and fight for a spot in the front. Others can quote Dylan\u2019s words but don\u2019t have much to say on their own. A.J. Weberman's dumpster-diving search for the ultimate Dylan sends him off the deep end. He concludes that \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d is actually a racist screed: \u201cI wasted my fucking life on this shit.\u201d", "It's not all this way.

Scott Warmuth rescues the reputation of those obsessed with tracking the literary allusions in Dylan\u2019s works. This clan of the tribe gets a bad name because their pursuits get tedious fast, leading to long lists of footnotes and boring debates over whether Dylan is a plagiarist. But Warmuth, a disc jockey, musician, and writer, is not just a squirrel gathering nuts.

Many biographers treat this time as a talentless detour, but\u00a0it offers a useful way to distinguish between the fan who uses Dylan as a crutch and those who use him as a walking stick. Dylan\u2019s religious fans don\u2019t think he\u2019s a god, but a preacher, someone who illuminates a larger truth, one he\u2019s also searching for. He's taking fans on that journey. Dylan feels better when he can provide illumination rather than answers. \u201cI\u2019m the first person who\u2019ll put it to you,\u201d he once said, \u201cand the last person who will explain it to you.\u201d", "Michelle Engert offers a secular example of the kind of fan Dylan might like.

She\u00a0becomes a public defender. Because she had hitchhiked and lived on the streets following Dylan, she\u2019s more savvy than she might otherwise have been.\u00a0\u201cBob Dylan made her a better lawyer,\u201d Kinney concludes.", "These characters are closer to the larger swarm of Dylan hobbyists\u2014people like me, I hope\u2014who have been influenced by the singer but not asphyxiated. There was a time in my life that I fit the profile of one of Kinney\u2019s Dylanologists. I spent the night on the street outside Tower Records in New York to get tickets to one of Dylan's 1993 Supper Club shows. I lined up in Charlottesville at daybreak to be in the front row. I spent part of my last summer before college touring around after him. I\u00a0have two bookshelves devoted to books about him. \u201cIt was the first poetry that spoke my own language,\u201d I might say about Dylan\u2014as Dylan said about Jack Kerouac.", "Photo by Marjan Osman Gartland", "Dylan is the artist that helped me take hold of the world when I was in high school, a time when you're looking for explanations anyway. He\u00a0taught me about the power of words, taking risks, justice and faith\u2014secular and religious. He offered some pretty practical notions about love, regret, and willpower that sounded catchy to the ear.", "Dylan got the first crack on influencing those ideas, so he's still there when I touch them again later in life. Music that helps you form your identity reminds you of who you are, and can immediately take you back to those moments of self-creation.", "Kinney\u2019s deeply reported book delineates the difference between Dylan\u2019s obsession with Guthrie and the obsessions of the most extreme of the Dylanologists. Dylan used his obsession to become his own creative force. The\u00a0Dylanologists, meanwhile, are\u00a0entombed\u00a0by their passion. They are very active\u2014road miles accumulate, tapes are collected, and they are enlivened by the briefest glances Dylan gives them from the stage\u2014but in the end they seem dissipated by the relationship.\u00a0At some point, the Dylan fan has to get off the bus, the way Michelle Engert did, the way Dylan got off the Guthrie bus. It is a paradox of the many characters Kinney describes. They have listened to Bob Dylan for so long, but some of them have not heard.", "---", "by David Kinney.
