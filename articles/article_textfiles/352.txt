And then I saw it: looking down at her feet, she swiveled to the side, and discreetly moonwalked backwards across the floor.", "It definitely wasn\u2019t virtuosic, but it did have a hint of the uncanny, as the moonwalk inevitably does.", "Browning plays with form and language in other ways too.

His need to get lost\u2014whether in old Merce clips or in just Googling the \u201cpolitics of lurking\u201d\u2014serves as a cautionary tale on the dangers of an always-mediated online life. And the people that surround Gray\u2014his sick boyfriend, his fellow academics, his elderly neighbor and friends, even the commenters\u2014are all confronted with loneliness too.
