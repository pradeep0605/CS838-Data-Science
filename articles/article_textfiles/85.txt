But it\u2019s an idea that had been in the air for a while before Wells made it his own (and everyone else\u2019s). The notion that time and space might be part of a contiguous phenomenon, Gleick writes, emerged at some point in the 19", "century, spurred on by developments in mathematical theory and applied technology: \u201cTime became vivid, concrete, and spatial to anyone who saw the railroad smashing across distances on a coordinated schedule\u2014coordinated by the electric telegraph, which was pinning time to the mat.\u201d", "A variety of cultural factors\u2014the impact of Darwinian evolutionary theory, for one thing, and the rate of societal and technological change brought about by the rise of capitalism\u2014ushered in a modern notion of time as inherently bound up with progress: a distinct sense that the future would be even less like the present than the present was like the past. Where once the world had seemed immutable, a system of rigid social orders and immemorial cultural practices overseen by eternal gods, it was now subject to the transformational effect of technology. (", "\u2019s initial chapters, in this sense, touch on some of the same subjects Gleick explored in his 1999 book", ") \u201cAbove all,\u201d writes Gleick, \u201cmodern time was irreversible, inexorable, and unrepeatable. Progress marched onward\u2014a good thing, if you were a technological optimist. Cyclical time, crosswinds of time, eternal return, the wheel of life: these were romantic notions now, for poets and nostalgic philosophers.\u201d", "The idea of the Future\u2014by which I mean the Kanye West and Elon Musk sense of \u201cthe futch,\u201d as distinct from the feverish auguries of religious prophesy\u2014began in earnest, claims Gleick:", "The book is faithful enough to its plain-dealing title: Certainly, Gleick gives the impression of having read everything that has ever been written on the topic of time travel\u2014largely as a byproduct of his having read everything ever written on any topic at all. He is, to be clear, a writer of almost freakish erudition. In one two-page stretch of the book, I clocked references to (among others) Plato, Heraclitus, Miguel de Unamuno, Parmenides, Nabokov, Marcus Aurelius, the original series of", "Sebald, and Borges. With a lot of authors, this level of learnedness can seem flamboyant, or even slightly hysterical, but there\u2019s an infectious kid-in-a-candy-shop gleefulness to Gleick\u2019s hyperactive referencing that reminded me of nothing so much as the nonfiction writing of Borges himself. (Borges, along with Wells and Einstein and Proust, is one of a handful of totemic figures in the book, a seerlike figure guiding us through the labyrinthine wasteland of modernity.)", "It\u2019s strange to think that the Romans didn\u2019t sit around imagining a souped-up chariot that would whisk them back to ancient Greece.", "But Gleick\u2019s real subject here, in fact, is not so much time travel as time itself, that slipperiest of subjective phenomena. He examines it from every angle, bringing to bear a formidable array of analytical instruments\u2014philosophy, poetry, physics, science fiction, and psychology. It wouldn\u2019t be right to suggest that the book had anything so straightforwardly utilitarian as a bottom line, but the overall impression I got from it is that no one\u2014least of all practitioners of the hard sciences\u2014has any definitive answers on what time is, or in what sense it can actually be said to exist. Gleick is particularly good on the extent to which our understanding of time is reflective of\u2014as opposed to merely reflected by\u2014the words we use to talk about it. The language of spatial measurement and movement, he suggests, forces us to conceive of our experience of time in a particular way: \u201cWho was the first person to say that time \u2018passes\u2019 or \u2018flows\u2019? We are seldom conscious of the effect of language on our choice of metaphors, the effect of our metaphors on our sense of reality. Usually we give the words no thought at all. When we do, we may well wonder what we\u2019re really saying.\u201d", "Like the faithful student of Borges he is, Gleick is an acute observer of the feedback loop that exists between fantasy and reality, the way in which science and fiction mutually inform one another. The book subtly suggests the links between, say, the mathematician Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s theory of closed timelike curves\u2014an extrapolation of Einstein\u2019s relativity whereby, in certain possible \u201cuniverses,\u201d time loops back upon itself\u2014and mythologies of cyclical time, as well as any number of speculative sci-fi scenarios. Gleick is, above all, a gifted synthesizer of difficult materials, a writer who can draw together disparate cultural fragments\u2014from Marcel Proust to Niels Bohr, from the introduction of daylight saving time to Philip K. Dick, from William James to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2014into a rich and complex whole. He doesn\u2019t make a great deal of the point, but it\u2019s hard to avoid the overall impression of science and philosophy and poetry and fiction as one great human grasp at comprehension, at making sense of the vast and unknowable universe in which we find ourselves. What makes him so engaging as a science writer is his distinctly nonjingoistic stance in relation to other ways of thinking about the world. \u201cThe computers in our thought experiments,\u201d as he puts it toward the end of the book, \u201cif not always the computers we own, are deterministic because people have designed them that way. Likewise,", ". They have an ideal perfection that can be attained in the mind or in the Platonic realm but not in the real world.\u201d", "Gleick seems strangely unconcerned\u2014or at least reticent\u2014about why we might be so preoccupied with the fantasy of time travel to begin with. Although he situates it historically, he has very little to say about the deep emotional resonances of the subject, the melancholy human heart that beats beneath the technological fantasy of thwarting time\u2019s relentless unidirectionality. And this is of a piece, I think, with the book\u2019s hyperactive erudition: He tends to progress from synopsizing the plot of a novel to sketching scientific theory to compressing a philosophical argument, without ever pausing to do much in the way of contemplation himself. In this sense, the book sometimes seems to move too lightly, and too quickly, for its own good.", "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was written in 1889 by Mark Twain.\u00a0 I suppose the time travel wasn't accomplished through an invention, but still.", "", "", "", "", "But when the pace slows, as it does in the final chapter, there is a grace and an elegiac wisdom to Gleick\u2019s writing that brings the mystery and vastness of his subject into perspective. He understands that understanding is only ever partial, and fleeting, in the flow of time, whatever that might mean. \u201cWhen the future vanishes into the past so quickly,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhat remains is a kind of atemporality, a present tense in which temporal order feels as arbitrary as alphabetical order. [...] It might be fair to say that all we perceive is change\u2013\u2013that any sense of stasis is a constructed illusion. Every moment alters what came before. We reach across layers of time for the memories of memories.\u201d Time travel may be a fantasy, and time itself may be nothing at all, but it is a nothingness that structures our entire experience of the world.", "Rediscover the joys and surprises of great literature!
