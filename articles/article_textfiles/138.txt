But there\u2019s much more going on here from a filmmaking perspective. As Nayman observes, in this scene, Verhoeven violates the \u201c180-degree rule\u201d\u2014a basic filmmaking principle that dictates that the camera must stay on one side of the object being filmed. If you\u2019re shooting a conversation between two characters who are facing each other, like in the restaurant scene, one character should always remain on the right side of the frame while the other stays on the left; the camera should not cross over an imaginary line drawn between the two characters.", "Halfway through the lunch scene, however, Verhoeven \u201ccrosses the line\u201d: Where before Nomi always appeared on the right side of the frame, now she\u2019s on the left. The technique, Nayman argues, hints that Nomi and Cristal\u2014whose name is significant, \u201ccrystal being a surface that reflects\u201d\u2014are mirror images of each other, and provides a sneaky bit of filmic irony to Nomi\u2019s insistence that she\u2019s nothing like Cristal. \u201cI\u2019ll never be like you,\u201d she tells her rival, even as she mimics Cristal\u2019s earlier gesture by flicking a bit of Champagne\u2014Cristal, of course\u2014in her face. \u201cGood filmmaking propping up bad screenwriting; a bad actress dragging down a good one,\u201d Nayman writes. \u201cIt\u2019s all in plain view.\u201d", "So the film is, in some ways, savvier than it lets on. But to what effect?", ", Nayman offers, \u201cis a movie that is also a mirror, one that offers a vivid rearview on a very particular pop-cultural moment and also a telling reflection of the viewer.\u201d Like the whore Nomi once was,", "can be anything you want it to be.
