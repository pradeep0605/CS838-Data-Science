In the first,", ", narrator Elena Greco learns that her lifelong companion, rival, and confidante, Rafaella \u201cLila\u201d Cerullo, has disappeared. The story then plunges back 60 years to trace the beginnings of their relationship. In the sequel,", ", Lila entrusts Elena with a box containing her private journals\u2014which Elena, at that point a budding writer in her late teens, mines for stories before throwing them off a bridge.", ", the third of a set that will likely comprise four volumes, opens in 2005, the last time Elena sees Lila before her disappearance. The two women are out walking the", "of their old neighborhood when they discover, sprawled in a flowerbed, the corpse of someone they once knew. Lila laments the dead woman\u2019s \u201cpretensions, her betrayals,\u201d while Elena\u2019s thoughts wander to the fates of others who have remained in Naples:", "For Elena, Naples is mired in constant violence, with women too often its victims. Even the local dialect is a kind of hyper-masculine grotesque: \u201cThe coarse language of the environment we came from was useful for attack or self-defense, but, precisely because it was the language of violence, it hindered, rather than encouraging, intimate confidences.\u201d And so Elena writes, both to establish some commensurate language for her own experiences, and to recapture the intimacy her upbringing has stolen.", "What she writes are the novels we are reading, which now span some 1,200 pages. The story isn\u2019t quite a confessional, but it does feel as though it\u2019s been told out of necessity, with an almost desperate urgency that propels one episode to the next. It is so deeply intimate that one is tempted to conflate Elena Greco with Elena Ferrante, the pen name of someone who, like Elena Greco, grew up in Naples. Ferrante\u2019s true identity is a mystery, though some biographical details have emerged in letters and interviews, published collectively as", ". Perhaps because of the freedom afforded by anonymity, Ferrante\u2019s work feels intensely personal\u2014written, as the reclusive author believes all fiction should be, \u201cas if your innermost self had been ransacked.\u201d In Ann Goldstein\u2019s English translations, Ferrante\u2019s sentences have an incantatory power, as well as profound psychological and cultural insights. \u201cThe true reader,\u201d Ferrante claims, \u201csearches not for the brittle face of the author in flesh and blood \u2026 but the naked physiognomy that remains in every effective word.\u201d", "Ferrante\u2019s sentences have an incantatory power, as well as profound psychological and cultural insights.", "And yet, in", ", the work of the novelist\u2014especially", "is dismissed as frivolous and bourgeois, at least compared to the activism and agitation of 1970s Italy. \u201cIn those circles that were so caught up and sucked in by political passions,\u201d Elena claims, \u201cmy [first] book was considered an insignificant little thing.\u201d But, gradually, she also discovers that writing the female body\u2014the flesh made word\u2014fosters its own form of resistance, especially when it challenges the patriarchy and provincialism of Naples.", "Having fled \u201cthat place of disorder and danger,\u201d first to Pisa, then Florence, by her late 20s Elena has established herself nationally as an important literary figure, a respected intellectual, a political pundit. And yet: \u201cUpon every return to my own city, I feared that some unexpected event would keep me from escaping, that the things I had gained would be taken from me.\u201d Naples is not all that haunts and threatens her: Lila, who has stayed, exerts a similar hold. \u201cHer shadow goaded me, depressed me, filled me with pride, deflated me, giving me no rest.\u201d", "In many ways the friends are each other\u2019s opposites. Lila is forthright, daring, a believer in absolutes; Elena is timid, pensive, and ambivalent. But together they form a \u201ccounter-melody\u201d that links them inextricably. The two women recall Michel de Montaigne\u2019s idea that true friends \u201cmix and blend one into the other [in] so perfect a union that the seam which has joined them is effaced and disappears.\u201d Montaigne was speaking sentimentally, though: There is no pure harmony here. Their fierce attachment\u2014and equally fierce enmity\u2014courses through the novels, even when, in adulthood, their relationship turns as parasitic as it was once symbiotic: Elena cribs her first book from a story Lila wrote as a child, and Lila\u2019s jealousy descends into outright abuse.", "In", "their rivalry turns romantic when Lila begins an affair with Nino, the man Elena has loved since primary school. In this volume, Elena takes him back\u2014a rare moment of action from someone who functions mainly as Lila\u2019s documentarian. (Lila \u201cmoves people like characters in a story,\u201d and Elena imagines her saying, \u201cYou wanted to write novels, I created a novel with real people, with real blood, in reality.\u201d) Even as adults, their connection is most dynamic when they are creating stories together. On the telephone one night, Elena is revitalized when the two friends reconstruct an old neighborhood murder: \u201cAs in one of our childhood games, when it seemed to us that we were in all ways complementary, I followed her step by step, adding my voice excitedly to hers, and I had the impression that together\u2014the girls of the past and the adults of now\u2014we were arriving at a truth that for two decades had been unspeakable.\u201d", "Given how utterly Elena depends on her friend, when Lila disappears it seems not only an attempt to \u201celiminate the entire life that she had left behind,\u201d but a threat to Elena\u2019s existence. These novels, then, become not only documents of witness or recovery but also a means of beating Lila at her own game. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who wins this time,\u201d Elena gloats", "\u201cI turned on the computer and began to write\u2014all the details of our story, everything that still remained in my memory.\u201d", "In most of her books, Ferrante strives to write the female body\u2014especially its devastation and destruction.", "doesn\u2019t exactly abandon those concerns, but the focus turns from physicality to absence. Elena speaks of her literary ambitions as documenting \u201cwhat seems unsayable and what we do not speak to ourselves\u201d\u2014essentially what she has failed to say to her closest friend and can only type now that she\u2019s gone. The title suggests absolutes\u2014", "(Elena)", "(Lila)\u2014but the subtitle, \u201cMiddle Time,\u201d hints at something else. Like its narrator, the novel is less interested in obvious binaries\u2014of language (Neapolitan/Italian), social geography (South/North), ideology (communist/fascist), gender, faith, and class\u2014than in the mucky territory between.", "The novel becomes a synthesis of these antipathies, a world, as Elena describes it, of \u201cdissolving boundaries.\u201d She never fully identifies with Naples and its brutality, yet she remains an impostor among refined Northerners, \u201cthe daughter of the porter with the dialect cadence of the South,\u201d who is only \u201cplaying the part of the cultured writer.\u201d She marries into a respected academic family, has children, publishes a book, and none of these roles\u2014wife, mother, even author\u2014seems to fit her. Only later does she realize what she was chasing in her \u201cmiddle time,\u201d and why: \u201cI had wanted to become something \u2026 only because I was afraid that Lila would become someone and I would stay behind.", ". I had to start again to", ", but for myself, as an adult, outside of her.\u201d", "And so we have the book in our hands, this bildungsroman of that becoming, which finally discards its muse to explore the world beyond. At one point, Elena, who has been struggling to finish a second novel after the success of her first, shares a draft of a work-in-progress with Lila. Her friend is reluctant, then vindictive, saying \u201cit\u2019s an ugly, ugly book and the one before it was, too.\u201d Elena is devastated. She fears that not only is her literary career finished, but their relationship might be ruined, too. She turns her thinking inward, and then, recognizing that she has suffered through two relationships that were, in essence, plays of male power, begins an essay about the ways that men have depicted women in literature, from the Bible through Flaubert. A draft is well received by her editors; it will be published\u2014and, free from Lila\u2019s influence, Elena falls in love. She seems to be entering some new chapter in her life, in which, at last, she will tell only of herself.", "---", ", by Elena Ferrante, translated by Ann Goldstein.
