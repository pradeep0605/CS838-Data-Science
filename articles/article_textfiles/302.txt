He plays a bit part in various historical moments, at one point watching the rehabilitated German scientist Wernher von Braun accept an award. Elsewhere, he stumbles across a crucial stockpile of Nazi rocket designs in the night forests of Vellinghausen. A brilliant engineer and self-styled tough guy, he hunts Nazi missile-builders during the war. (Naively, he hopes these men of science can help his country realize the humanist dream of a moon landing; this idealism is cruelly punished by what he sees in Nordhausen\u2019s labor camps.)

There\u2019s something tearstained about even the wildest flights of Chabonian fancy, as if each wondrous occurrence stood in for some feeling the writer couldn\u2019t state outright.

Beneath all the beauty and strangeness, the two can barely communicate:", "A fevered and turbulent passage like this reveals just a fraction of Chabon\u2019s range.
