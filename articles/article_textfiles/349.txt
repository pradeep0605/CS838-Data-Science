The money-obsessed residents of Pepys Road in South London\u2014bankers and their wives, strivers from foreign lands, gadflies, homebodies, and troublemakers\u2014would have seemed, despite the 300-year gap, pleasingly familiar to the great London diarist. As a shady businessman, a lover of ladies, a chronicler of a city already bursting at the seams, Pepys would have quite enjoyed", "And future historians might find the minutely detailed novel as useful a guide to London at the Great Recession as we, today, find Pepys\u2019 diaries to London at the Great Fire.", "Dan Kois edits and writes for", "\u2019s\u00a0culture department.

Though with few exceptions the residents of Pepys Road don\u2019t know each other very well, they know each other\u2019s houses. And they know what the houses are worth. \u201cWhen people met they held off the subject of house prices with a conscious sense of restraint,\u201d Lanchester writes, \u201cand gave in to the desire to talk about them with relief.\u201d It is delightful to talk about home values, of course, when it\u2019s your own home\u2019s skyrocketing value you\u2019re really discussing, and Pepys Road has turned into a sort of \u201ccasino in which you were guaranteed to be a winner\u201d\u2014indeed, London, in Lanchester\u2019s telling, has become a city \u201cof winners and losers, and all the people in the street, just by living there, had won.\u201d", "As the novel opens, the residents of Pepys Road have begun receiving mysterious postcards: photographs of their own houses, bearing the legend WE WANT WHAT YOU HAVE. This harassment campaign, which escalates into acts of minor vandalism, is the thread connecting the residents of the neighborhood, the novel\u2019s central mystery, and by far the weakest part of the book. Lanchester neither gives the mystery any urgency nor explores the ugliness of the class divisions it\u2019s meant to expose; when we learn the identity of the person behind the campaign, we shrug. But that\u2019s fine; though the subplot feels like an early brainstorm that maybe shouldn\u2019t have made it through editing, it never torpedoes the rest of the book, which is rich in observation and warm in spirit, even toward its most disagreeable subjects.", "Those would be Roger and Arabella Yount. He\u2019s a banker coasting through life, a handsome, lazy-ish public-school prat who doesn\u2019t understand the fiendishly complicated numbers crunched within his own department but knows he deserves a million-pound bonus.

Roger didn\u2019t mind that, he was completely up for it, but it did mean that if he didn\u2019t get his million-pound bonus this year he was at genuine risk of going broke.", "It\u2019s not the last time that a character in", "will tally what he has and what he needs; the characters in Lanchester\u2019s London have complicated financial, strategic, and emotional ledger sheets, and the book is studded with discussions of worth, value, and want. Quite a bit of Roger\u2019s money goes to Zbigniew Tomascewski, Arabella\u2019s favorite builder, who early in the book uses some higher math to explain why an average-looking Polish workman is able to do so well with women:", "His philosophy was that if you were clean and financially solvent and not ugly you were already in the top 30 per cent of men. If in addition you listened to what women said to you, or were able to fake doing so convincingly, you were in the top 10 or even 5 per cent. Then all it took was to apply common sense: don\u2019t seem desperate, don\u2019t get drunk, do let the girl get drunk \u2026 It was all to do with improving your percentages.", "In", ", characters are exquisitely conscious of the value of everything. A parking warden, for whom each illegally parked auto is another step toward her quota, also competes with her co-workers to see who can ticket the most expensive car each day. An old woman, fearful about her dizzy spells, visits a doctor whose distracted brusqueness makes clear that he is \u201cso much more important than her.\u201d A Banksy-like graffiti artist (\u201cSmitty\u201d) knows that his real commodity, \u201chis most interesting artefact,\u201d is anonymity. A daughter, after her mother\u2019s death, thinks about her inheritance, a house on Pepys Road: \u201cIn the debit column, she had lost her mother; in the credit column, she now had a gigantic pile of cash.\u201d In a terrific irony, the only thing in", "that proves to be nearly worthless is, for complicated reasons, a suitcase full of money.", "Though Pepys Road is rich, and we spend some time with its rich denizens\u2014the Younts, a Senegalese football star and his father, that daughter and her gigantic pile of cash\u2014Lanchester is much more interested in those who work for them, like Zbigniew, or the cop investigating the postcards, or the Hungarian nanny enchanted by the magic she sees the Younts\u2019 money do. The novel gives us two separate scheming underlings, including Smitty\u2019s assistant, about whom Smitty cares so little he wishes he could just call all his assistants Nigel. (\u201cEvery year or so there would be a new Nigel. Short Nigels, tall Nigels, hairy Nigels, skinhead Nigels, Rasta Nigels \u2013 but always, in the final analysis, Nigels.\u201d)", "On the corner of Pepys Road lives a Muslim family, the Kamals, who run the shop downstairs. Their plot developments are Lanchester\u2019s hoariest, but his writing about them is his finest. It\u2019s a mix of fine-grained, reportorial detail, and vivid, imaginative projection into the minds of characters who in a lesser writer\u2019s hands could become clich\u00e9s. The three brothers, Ahmed, Usman, and Shahid, are each very different and constantly on each other\u2019s nerves; all of them are united in terror of their mother, whose visit in the second half of the book is a masterful comic set piece; and at the center of it is Rohinka, whose marriage to Ahmed was arranged in Pakistan but who nevertheless has grown to love her irritable, slouching husband. Late in the book, during Mrs. Kamal\u2019s torturous visit, Lanchester gives Rohinka a scene that perfectly captures the despond that can come over a parent at 5 in the morning when a child simply will not go back to sleep, and she realizes her ledger for the day is already in the red:", "Rohinka sighed. She hated the feeling of being already tired from the day\u2019s events, right at its very start, before the real day had even begun, but she pointed to Fatima\u2019s favourite stool. \u201cTen minutes, then back to bed,\u201d Rohinka said. \u201cOr you\u2019ll be too tired to go to school.\u201d Then, when her daughter hopped up and down, clapping with delight at being allowed to stay with her, she felt guilty.", "Photograph by Coll McDonnell.", "views London mostly through the wrong end of a telescope, its field of vision narrowed to Pepys Road and the people who spend time there, presenting the city in microcosm.

Of all the characters in the novel it\u2019s Zbigniew who is least at home in this city, constantly comparing it unfavorably to the Poland he once left and plans to return to as soon as he\u2019s got enough capital to go into business with his dad. (Even in its shitty weather London can\u2019t compare: \u201cIt was raining but not cold in a serious Polish way.\u201d) Zbigniew, who with his friends is forever disregarding \u201cthe London interludes of their lives\u201d in favor of the \u201creal Polish lives\u201d they\u2019ll soon be living, finds himself fascinated by the whole of the city stretching out to the horizon, its physical aspect, its shape: \u201cbig and low in the middle, with a higher edge in both directions, like a gigantic saucer.\u201d", "London might get its hooks into Zbigniew by the end, even as it might lose hold of other characters in this big, funny, sure-footed novel. (Even Roger, quintessential City man, finds himself dreaming of running off to a tropical paradise and opening up a beach shack where he\u2019d grill fish. After all, \u201ceveryone had always said his barbecues were brilliant.\u201d)", "takes as its milieu the beginning days of the current recession\u2014Roger smiles when reading of the collapse of Lehman Bros., thinking, \u201cNice to know he wasn\u2019t the only one having a super-shit day\u201d\u2014but it\u2019s less interested in providing a bird\u2019s-eye view of our new era than in tracking how the boom and onrushing bust affect his individual characters. Still, his ledgers and tallies suggest a warning of sorts about what\u2019s worth keeping from pre-crash society: Lanchester seems to prize the city as a home for the exceptional, while feeling that in the end its ground-level industriousness\u2014\u201cReal work never left you feeling worse,\u201d Zbigniew points out\u2014is what\u2019s of real value. It\u2019s a slightly cozy moral for such a sprawling book.", "But for all his ambition, Lanchester seems modest about the novel\u2019s ability to encompass a place as unruly as London or its teeming multitudes; very late in the book, a character whom I once disliked but grew to love despairs of the novels available in the detention center where the character waits for deportation. Lanchester writes that the detainee couldn\u2019t", "see the point of anything that was made up. Makela said that books helped her to escape, but that didn\u2019t make any sense. A book couldn\u2019t get you out of the detention centre, or land like a helicopter and carry you off, or magically turn into a UK passport which gave you the right of residency. Escape was very precisely, very specifically what a book couldn\u2019t help you do. Not in any literal sense.", "never quite turns into that helicopter, carrying the reader off; its short chapters balk the plot\u2019s forward motion, and Lanchester isn\u2019t particularly interested in bringing his broad cast of characters together for some great cataclysm at the end. That\u2019s not how it works in the city, where we\u2019re all living our own lives, lives which only occasionally, haphazardly intersect with everyone else\u2019s. But in the end I wasn\u2019t bothered by the book\u2019s fitful momentum, because I thought of it less as a novel than as a series of diary entries by thoughtful characters whose lives, together, gave me a picture of contemporary London\u2014a city of ambition, of shocking inequities, of grave crimes and foolish misdemeanors, a city that Samuel Pepys would barely recognize but nevertheless one in which he, striver and scrapper that he was, would do quite well for himself indeed.", "---", "by John Lanchester.
