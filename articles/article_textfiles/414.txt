The cowboy is 6 feet 2 inches tall with a cleft chin, strong jaw, and well-formed lips (\u201cmama said meow\u201d). He could buy all his accessories in a Brooklyn men\u2019s shop, but he doesn\u2019t have to because he\u2019s the real thing, a real rancher in a real cowboy hat who herds real cattle and wears his faded Wranglers so well that they turn the heads of the gay couples at the hipster bar where they go on their first date (back when Valdes still believed it was OK for the woman to pick the location of a date).", "Our heroine\u2019s attraction to him\u2014that is, the animal attraction of a trash-talking feminist who grew up in a Marxist, Barbie-free household to this \u2026 this \u2026", "this brute with a pickup truck and a gun rack who watches Fox News and eats steak\u2014comes as an unwelcome surprise to her at first. She wonders: Aren\u2019t all conservatives \u201cstupid! Or evil!\u201d? Shouldn\u2019t a good feminist only be into guys in tweed suits who recycle? Isn\u2019t it a liberal sin to be turned on by big, strong, leathery, tanned hands? But then she turns to Google and realizes that science and biology are on the side of her libido.

The best-selling author of", ", Valdes knows how to tease out a courtship\u2014 especially one involving a bonkers, rageaholic Latina; an inappropriate love object; various rivals for his affection; and a chorus of tut-tutting girlfriends. Valdes herself makes a sympathetic heroine\u2014a child of vain and hypocritical bohemian academics who was abandoned by her mother and who understood feminism to mean that women had to behave like the dominator in order to be free (the lesson the cowboy has to unlearn her). And the cowboy himself is central casting, \u201cso handsome it made you ache.

But Valdes is a scold: She pauses the story for extended explanations of just how little fun those of us who are not sleeping with cowboys are having. Feminism has ruined us all. In denying biology, it has thrown men into crisis. As her friend tells her, \u201cThey want to be men, but hate themselves for wanting to be men, so they push it all down and act like freakin\u2019 Prince,\u201d and they only express their manliness alone, in private, in front of porn sites. Women, meanwhile, have become desiccated and denatured, unable to understand the basic truth Valdes stumbled upon: \u201cFreedom came when I connected to the ancestral feminine womanhood that I carried in my DNA.\u201d The rest of us go on bad dates and pretend to lust after environmentalists who drive dented Subarus and wouldn\u2019t know a bull calf from a goat, while secretly we fantasize about Heath Ledger.", "Valdes is clearly tapping into a potent cultural disruption; in fact, you could even say she is late to this game.

The legal document Christian Grey presents to Anastasia Steele in", "is a prop in a bondage fantasy. The verbal instructions the cowboy gives Valdes once she agrees to submit to him are a guide to daily living. No back-talking; no second-guessing; no sarcastic, smart-ass remarks. She must never exit the car unless he opens the door for her. She must never walk on the street side of the sidewalk. In one especially creepy scene, Valdes has just overheard another woman leave a voicemail for the cowboy saying she wishes he were joining her in the shower. The cowboy lies about the voicemail, and Valdes knows he is lying. But then she remembers some article she read saying that women were \u201cbiologically programmed\u201d to find cheating men more attractive. \u201cI was hurt, sad, and turned on.\u201d He unbuckles his belt, and she throws her arms around his neck. \u201cBiology,\u201d she writes with a shrug.", "Photo by Alisa Valdes.", "Now might be the time to mention that the \u201cbiology\u201d Valdes is always quoting is of the shoddiest kind, the kind British tabloids reprint to enrage feminist blogs\u2014studies showing that men find women more attractive when they are ovulating, or that a woman can sniff a series of men\u2019s shirts and tell you which one has the most testosterone.

But I will point out that this is exactly what happens to people in cults: They begin to swallow the logic of the charismatic leader and rewrite their old lives. At a dinner with Valdes\u2019 parents, the cowboy convinces her to keep her distance because they only manipulate her to serve their narcissistic egos. He also convinces her that her son\u2019s diagnosis of autism is a \u201cbunch of bullshit,\u201d a byproduct of bad parenting and a liberal ethos and nothing a firm hand can\u2019t fix.
