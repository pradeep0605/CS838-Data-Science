But crucially, YA books present the teenage perspective in a fundamentally uncritical way. It\u2019s not simply that YA readers are asked to immerse themselves in a character\u2019s emotional life\u2014that\u2019s the trick of so much great fiction\u2014but that they are asked to abandon the mature insights into that perspective that they (supposedly) have acquired as adults.

These endings are emblematic of the fact that the emotional and moral ambiguity of adult fiction\u2014of the real world\u2014is nowhere in evidence in YA fiction.
