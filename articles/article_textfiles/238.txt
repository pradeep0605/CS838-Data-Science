I\u2019m supposed to recognize it, but I don\u2019t, quite; it could mean any number of things, and\u2014as in the best poetry\u2014those things are somehow inseparable from the expression the writer has already given them.", "Katy Waldman is a", "staff writer.", "The hawk-book\u2019s form is perfect.

Then she lost herself. Torn by grief, she acquired a goshawk\u2014a huge, bloodthirsty dinosaur, \u201cthe birdwatchers\u2019 dark grail\u201d\u2014to plug the wound.

Their hawks embody what they want to be, and are not. In Macdonald\u2019s case, that means a creature \u201csolitary, self-possessed, free from grief.\u201d In White\u2019s, she guesses: \u201cHe wanted to be ferocious. He wanted to be fey, a fairy, ferox. All those elements of himself he\u2019d pushed away, his sexuality, his desire for cruelty, for mastery: all these were suddenly there in the figure of the hawk.\u201d", "So the plan seems straightforward enough. Macdonald, bereft, will settle her score with death by becoming it. She will turn over her humanity to an ancient monster (\u201ca reptile.
