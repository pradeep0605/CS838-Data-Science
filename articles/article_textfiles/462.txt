He guessed he would probably have a fucking pimple on the end of his nose the day he died, and they would have to spread pancake makeup over it when they fixed him up for the casket display. People would pass by and say, \u2018My, he looks natural\u2014he even has a pimple on the end of his nose.\u2019 Sonny suspected he\u2019d be able to hear them say it, too, even though he wouldn\u2019t be able to talk back.

But Gunner, once the local high-school football star, is dissatisfied with small-town life after having his eyes opened on a three-month trip to Japan. (\u201cIt changed my whole approach.\u201d) My favorite section of the book is when earnest Gunner, trying to assert his individuality, grows a beard, which basically puts the whole town in a tizzy\u2014they won\u2019t even let him in the country-club pool.
