{"Body": ["Courtesy of University Press of Kentucky", "\u201cMention the name \u2018Duncan Hines\u2019 to Americans under fifty-five today and the image their minds will undoubtedly conjure is a cake mix package,\u201d writes Louis Hatchett in the introduction to", ", by way of explaining the necessity of a Hines biography. To older Americans, on the other hand, \u201cDuncan Hines was a man \u2026 who recommended the best places Americans could eat and sleep when traveling along the country\u2019s early paved highways at a time when they were thirsty for such knowledge.\u201d", "L.V. Anderson is a", "associate editor.", "The newly published biography, which painstakingly traces Hines\u2019 journey from renowned restaurant critic to cake-mix spokesman, is in fact a repackaging of Hatchett\u2019s out-of-print 2001 book, which had the arguably pithier subtitle", ". The timing of the new edition\u2019s appearance is apt: The prospective book purchasers of 2014 include a fresh batch of millennials who are both", "and ignorant of the fact that Hines was a real guy, renowned in his heyday not for canned frosting but for his best-selling, frequently updated, self-published guides to American restaurants and inns. There is something uncannily contemporary about Hines\u2019 career trajectory: Although Hines\u2019 books were a massive success in the 1930s, \u201940s, and \u201950s, it\u2019s easy to imagine that he\u2019d fare even better in the Internet age. His writing was chatty, self-important, and marketing-friendly. If he lived today, Duncan Hines would be the world\u2019s most famous food blogger.", "Alas, Hines came of age a century too early to earn a cult following online. He was born in 1880 in Bowling Green, Kentucky, the youngest child of a former Confederate soldier. Hines\u2019 mother died when Hines was 4, and his father shipped him and one of his brothers off to live with his maternal grandmother, who raised them on \u201capple pie, pecan pie, \u2026 country ham, candied yams, turnip greens with fatback, beaten biscuits and cornbread,\u201d as Hines later reminisced.", "As a young adult, Hines headed out West to work for Wells Fargo and the Green Copper Company for a few years before settling down with his first wife, Florence, in Chicago. As a traveling salesman for a direct mail advertising firm, Hines began taking notes about the best places to eat across America; his search for decent restaurants soon became an all-consuming hobby. As Hines found himself inundated with requests for recommendations from friends and acquaintances, he decided to publish a pamphlet of his endorsements, which was so popular it morphed into a book,", ", in 1936, which soon spawned other books about cooking, eating, and traveling. All in all, Hines sold almost 2 million books between 1936 and 1947, and became so famous that in 1948 he had better name recognition than the vice president of the United States. This is why food manufacturers clamored to get Hines\u2019 name on their products, and eventually succeeded.", "By 1955, Duncan Hines products were bringing in $50 million. Clearly, Hines had his price.", "In short, Duncan Hines was, objectively speaking, a big deal: one of the country\u2019s first food celebrities, beloved by millions. \u201cAmericans regarded his every word with the highest esteem,\u201d writes Hatchett. Hatchett regards Hines\u2019 every word with the highest esteem, too\u2014but that makes the book a little weird, because Duncan Hines sounds like\u2014how to put this?\u2014a domineering, narcissistic jerk.", "As a child, he and his friends built a snowman on train tracks near their home, and as a train approached, \u201cthe engineer slammed on the brakes so hard to avoid hitting it the violent action uncoupled some of the cars.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a one-time event: He also greased up the tracks on an incline to prevent trains from reaching the top of the hill. Hatchett describes these incidents, which endangered passengers\u2019 lives, as \u201cmischief and merry-making.\u201d", "Hines\u2019 youthful indiscretions weren\u2019t the only thing that left a sour taste in my mouth after reading", ". According to a former employee, Hines would hire female secretaries \u201cif he decided he liked somebody\u2019s looks.\u201d His second wife, Emelie, divorced him on the grounds of \u201ccruelty.\u201d He had a violent temper; his nephew worked briefly for Hines, \u201cbut he quit after about three weeks because his uncle was partial to \u2018blowing up\u2019 at him over usually inconsequential matters.\u201d Hines was vain and so craved attention from fans that he put up a sign in front of his home announcing that he lived there. (\u201cSuccess did not go to his head,\u201d Hatchett elsewhere asserts.)", "Worse, to my mind, Hines was a total snob. \u201cHines had no patience with people who had failed in life,\u201d write Hatchett. After his first book was published in 1936, he surrounded himself with those he deemed \u201csuccessful people.\u201d \u201cIn Hines\u2019s day, people from this social strata tended to travel frequently enough to experience \u2018adventures in good eating\u2019; hoi polloi did not. People who had succeeded in life, Hines felt, could be trusted; they had competently managed their careers and finances to the point where they were considered honorable members of society.\u201d This was a remarkably callous view to hold during the Great Depression.", "It\u2019s always difficult to take a person who lived by the standards of behavior of a different time and judge him by our own. But Hatchett has a stubborn blind spot where Hines\u2019 character flaws are concerned: Even as he reports on evidence of Hines\u2019 superciliousness, volatility, sexism, and cruelty, he asserts that Hines was a king among men. \u201cDuncan Hines rose to fame simply because he possessed human qualities many Americans wanted to see in their fellow man: character, uncompromising honesty, and integrity,\u201d he writes. Hines was \u201can average man who came to America\u2019s attention, was perceived by them as unusually trustworthy and who, because of that perception, became an American icon. Surprisingly, the public\u2019s perception and the reality were nearly identical.\u201d", "Hatchett isn\u2019t the first biographer to revere his subject. But at times in this book, he seems less like Hines\u2019 biographer writing in the 21", "century and more like his PR man pushing a story to 1930s rubes.", "Hines was beloved by the public, Hatchett writes, because he refused to accept remuneration for his endorsements: \u201cOne restaurant offered Hines $10,000 for an advertisement; Hines refused, \u2018preferring to keep his book uninfluenced by any commercial considerations.\u2019 \u201d But what\u2019s fascinating is that Hatchett maintains his reverence for Duncan Hines\u2019 clean hands even as his own thorough research reveals that, by contemporary standards, Hines\u2019 hands had an awful lot of dirt on them. (Or was that frosting?) He charged money for the restaurants he endorsed to display a \u201cDuncan Hines Seal of Approval,\u201d and, since the profit margins on his guidebooks were so low, he made most of his income this way (until he began shilling for cake mixes). \u201cHis sign rental business translated into an annual profit of almost $38,000 a year,\u201d writes Hatchett, in an era when the average U.S. income was about $3,000. Hines also openly expected the restaurants in the \u201cDuncan Hines Family\u201d to sell his books to their customers, and he complained that those that didn\u2019t \u201cwere nothing but ingrates.\u201d Most ostentatiously, Hines accepted", "as a birthday gift from the \u201cDuncan Hines Family\u201d restaurateurs. That these quid pro quo arrangements\u2014in which Hines got most of his money, plus some sweet swag, from the very people he was endorsing\u2014might constitute a conflict of interest never seems to cross Hatchett\u2019s mind.", ">\u00a0Duncan Hines made a career out of having it both ways.  So he had his cake and ate it too?", "", "-muddylemon", "", "", "", "\u201cThe man who said \u2018Every man has his price\u2019 never met Duncan Hines,\u201d writes Hatchett at the beginning of the book. As I read about Hines\u2019 deal with ad exec Roy Park to put his name and photo on grocery items (including the enduring cake mix), I kept turning back to that page to confirm I\u2019d really read those words. Park went on to sell Duncan Hines\u2013branded jam, pickles, mushrooms, sherbet, salad dressing, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, bread, pancake mix, ice cream, cooking ranges, and coffee makers. By 1955, Duncan Hines products were bringing in $50 million (about $441 million in today\u2019s dollars), with Hines earning royalties from each sale. Clearly, Hines had his price.", "It\u2019s not that I think Hines did the wrong thing by selling out. (Who among us wouldn\u2019t take a cut of that $50 mil?) It\u2019s just that there was clearly some tension between his vaunted objectivity and his business agreements. Instead of exploring that tension, Hatchett presents Hines\u2019 personal mythology to modern readers who are long past accepting midcentury heroism at face value.", "It\u2019s easy to imagine a modern-day Duncan Hines launching a food blog chronicling his search for hidden meccas of regional cooking across the country, but it\u2019s hard to imagine Hines launching a successful cake-mix brand today. In the mid-20", "century, there was no obvious contradiction between Hines\u2019 role as a booster for local, independent restaurants and his role as a spokesman for processed grocery store fare. Today, Hines would have to pick one role or the other: champion of the little guy or Big Food apologist? This odd but interesting biography makes it clear that Duncan Hines made a career out of having it both ways.", "---", "by Louis Hatchett.
