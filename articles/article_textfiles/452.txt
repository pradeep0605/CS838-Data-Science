The mystery is what, if anything, it\u2019s moored to, and how deeply.", "His detractors\u2014of whom there are plenty, thanks to his notoriety among a mostly young and largely New York City\u2013based literary set\u2014say there\u2019s little beneath the surface at all. These critics point to Lin\u2019s history of self-promotional antics\u2014", ",", "\u2014as evidence of the ultimate \u201cunseriousness\u201d of his work, dismissing his considerable output as millennial narcissism. His fiction, too, can appear gimmicky and needlessly attention-grabbing:", ", his 2010 novel, is provocatively and mysteriously named after the author of", ", depicts an illicit (and transparently autobiographical) affair between a 22-year-old writer and his 16-year-old lover, and calls those protagonists Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning (again, provocatively and mysteriously).", "But the problems that the oddly named couple faces are portrayed with refreshing directness and honesty, even as their world\u2014like the stripped-down prose used to describe it\u2014becomes progressively claustrophobic and oppressive. Better and more enjoyable is Lin\u2019s novella", "(2009), which reads in style and tone like a companion piece to", "but is sharper and funnier, the aimless wanderings of its protagonist from library to Whole Foods to holding cell\u2014and his yearning for human connection along the way\u2014more suitably contained in a brisk 112 pages. Both books depart from the entertaining, overstuffed style of Lin\u2019s previous fiction, the story collection", "and the novel", "(both 2007), written in what Lin has called a \u201cLorrie Moore style\u201d that feels at once braver and less assured. These books leap around in time and shift perspectives; they\u2019re full of inventive imagery and passages that turn mundane thoughts into skewed meditations. The more Hemingway-ish \u201c", "\u201d that Lin subsequently adopted is a deliberate restraint of such writerly gifts.", ", Lin\u2019s first novel with a big publishing house, synthesizes these two styles. It traces roughly 18 months of a young writer\u2019s local and international meanderings. With its casual drug use and tabloidy feel (a diligent Googler could probably identify many of the characters depicted, often young writers like the author), it may strike the anti-Lin contingent as more of the self-aggrandizing same. Yet despite Lin\u2019s frequent efforts to put himself in the public eye, his fiction has become most conspicuous for what it refuses to show\u2014and", "casts a surprisingly introspective eye on the spare, 21", "-century landscape Lin has such a knack for depicting.", "At the beginning of", ", Paul\u2014like Lin, a 20-something writer entrenched in the New York literary scene\u2014breaks up with his girlfriend. Alone and bored, he starts dabbling in drugs during an \u201cinterim period\u201d\u00a0before his next book tour. He finds himself in scattered bars and apartments across Brooklyn, bumping into other literary types who are also mostly on drugs. He reconnects with an online acquaintance, Erin, who joins him at various stops along his tour; they bond by recording movies with their MacBooks of themselves on drugs. At the end of the tour, still on drugs, they decide to marry in Las Vegas. Then they visit Paul\u2019s parents in Taipei, where they make more films of themselves on drugs. (Lin and the writer Megan Boyle, on whom Erin is obviously based, also married and subsequently started a film company together called", ".)", "Did I mention drugs? There are drugs, lots of them. But while rampant and instructionally varied\u2014they include \u201c", ",\u201d as Dwight Garner helpfully listed in the", "\u2014the drug use isn\u2019t terribly glamorous (unless vomiting in a taxi on the way to live-tweeting a movie is your idea of a wild night). It feels odd to downplay the licking of cocaine from another person\u2019s testicles, but the book contains perhaps the least lurid account of that act that it is possible to write.", "The characters in Lin\u2019s previous work often hid behind their digital avatars\u2014on Gchat, on Twitter, on blogs\u2014as a way of furtively connecting. In", ", drugs are a kind of toll they pay to engage with each other in the physical world. After a while, the drugs become cultural wallpaper, like the books the characters reference or the smartphones they carry. Nothing great happens; nothing terrible either. Late in the book, Paul says of his drug use, \u201cI think it\u2019s sustainable, as long as I\u2019m healthy.\u201d\u00a0You almost believe him.", "There is some shock value in this blas\u00e9 attitude, as there was in the uncomfortable (and, in some states, legally dicey) central relationship of", ". But shock isn\u2019t the point. On ecstasy their first night in Taipei, the frightening newness of their relationship still plainly obvious, Paul and Erin explore the city and video themselves in a long, extended take. The exchange is oddly riveting, as are their deeply personal questions\u2014about ex-lovers, sexual compatibility, body image\u2014negotiating the thin line between curiosity and plain insecurity. \u201cYou seem to encompass major things of what I want, in ways I feel like only segments of other people \u2026 have,\u201d Paul confesses to Erin in his halting, stilted manner. Pages later, Erin asks, \u201cWhat is my body \u2026 do you have problems with my body? \u2026 If you don\u2019t you can \u2026 something.\u201d\u00a0Paul tries to reassure her, but fails; if he were with someone with an \u201cideal\u201d weight, he says, \u201cI would find some other neurotic thing to focus on.\u201d The euphoric highs and crushing comedowns caused by the substances they take gradually fall in rhythm with the trajectory of their faltering relationship.", "Paul drifts mutely in and out of rooms, falling asleep in the middle of dance parties or escaping awkward dinners, his presence, or lack thereof, barely registered. Peripheral characters feel similarly insubstantial, introduced with only an age and credential. Paul meets his \u201cliterary acquaintance Anton, 23,\u201d\u00a0waits for \u201cJuan, 24, an MFA student in fiction at NYU,\u201d\u00a0and later is interviewed by \u201cAlethia, 22, who had published around six hundred articles since leaving college two years ago to write for Toronto\u2019s leading alt weekly.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s as if, to conceal them, Lin has filed down the entire person along with their fingerprints.", "This can be frustrating early on; it\u2019s difficult to remember, or even care about, a string of mostly indistinguishable characters. But it eventually becomes amusing, as it begins to seem like a wink at our youth- and status-obsessed times\u2014a bit like the \u00e4pp\u00e4r\u00e4t device that characters carry in Gary Shteyngart\u2019s", ", which helpfully provides a \u201chotness\u201d quotient. But if Paul distills others into these atomic stats, \u201ca kind of placeholder, auxiliary to an idea of a person,\u201d\u00a0as he says at one point, he stops well short of condemning others for doing the same. Lin isn\u2019t particularly concerned with how individuals find, or are denied, social acceptance. For a novel titled", ", in which the protagonist sometimes lingers on memories of his immigrant parents or of previous visits to the titular city, issues of identity and race also remain purposefully unexamined. Even when Paul and Erin wander the streets of Taipei, their ethnic relationship to the local population ostensibly reversed\u2014her ethnicity, like everyone else\u2019s, isn\u2019t specified, though she doesn\u2019t speak Mandarin, and Paul does\u2014cultural and racial dislocation is never a source of conflict, never connected to anyone\u2019s sense of alienation.", "Lin seems to ignore these questions as a way of setting everyone on the same plane, withholding judgment, denying easy justifications. His characters are all alone and adrift for the same basic human reasons. Lin neither satirizes his characters in the manner of Bret Easton Ellis, a writer to whom he\u2019s often compared, nor exalts them as bohemian heroes, in the style of, say, Jack Kerouac. No one is special. No one is exempt.", "Courtesy of Noah Kalina", "Lin\u2019s tech-inflected imagery suggests that this is a very contemporary condition\u2014or at least has taken a very contemporary form. Paul imagines \u201ctraveling alone in the vacuum-sealed tube of his own life\u201d and, having reached some final destination, \u201cbeing able to click on his trajectory to access his private experience, enlarging the dot of the coordinate \u2026 until it could be explored like a planet.\u201d Later, he feels stuck inside the \u201cinvulnerable dot of himself, irreducible and changeless as a prime number, on or off, there or not.\u201d If this sounds bleak, there is an understated hope in the mysterious and cyclical nature of things. Early on, Paul observes that Michelle, the girlfriend he broke up with, \u201cliked him enough to not simply leave and never speak to him again, which she could do\u2014which anyone could do, Paul thought, suddenly intrigued by the concept of gratitude.\u201d", "Lin is an existential writer, really, less interested in tracing the contours of his particular social group than in describing the very personal and sometimes unbearable tyranny of one\u2019s own mind\u2014and what it requires (sometimes measured in mg doses) to venture out in search of others.", "In the novel\u2019s climactic scene, Paul, after taking psilocybin mushrooms with Erin, believes he has overdosed and died. It\u2019s by turns terrifying and funny\u2014at one point Paul wonders how he could have forgotten an escalating heroin habit, which is, in fact, itself just a hallucination. His low-level freakout over his imagined death builds over a few pages to a revelation that, in its sheer unexpected beauty, recalls the powerfully moving ending of David Markson\u2019s", "(a novel that takes the theme of negation and solipsism to an extreme in quite a different way).", "I don\u2019t want to spoil either ending here; they\u2019re both worth encountering on one\u2019s own.", "has its flaws\u2014scenes in the first act can feel repetitive and drawn out, as if overly faithful to the author\u2019s memory, and some sentences are weighed down with adverbial excess. But if there are still a few kinks to be worked out in the prose, there is also a purposeful maturity, and even a subtle warmth, on display.
