{"Body": ["Illustration by Gustavo Duarte", "Whenever I read the work of the late German writer W.G. Sebald, I get distracted here and there by a preoccupation with the fact that he worked for most of his life as an academic. Probably this is because I\u2019ve spent many of my years in a similar environment, and I often wonder about the formative pressures this has exerted, over time, on my own writing and thinking. His relationship with the academy was not that of the standard contemporary writer, who is typically housed within the disciplinary annex of \u201ccreative writing\u201d and who does not concern himself with the business of academia per se. Sebald, although he did also teach creative writing, was a full-blown scholar, a company man of long standing who lectured in the department of German literature at the University of East Anglia from 1970 until his death in 2001. In ways that are both subtle and pronounced, this shows through in his writing\u2014in his essays and novels (which he preferred to call his \u201cprose narratives\u201d).", "Mark O'Connell is a", "books columnist and a staff writer for the", "Books like", "and", ", for instance, are, in much of their content if not their form, works of deep research. The Sebaldian narrator\u2014let\u2019s just go ahead and call him Sebald\u2014is a meandering presence, of course, picking his way across the secluded routes between landscape and subject; but there is always the sense of him emerging into the world after a long tenure in the artificial light of libraries and lecture halls, breathing the fine dust of scholarship. It\u2019s always tempting to compare Sebald to Borges\u2014among other narrative oddities,", "contains a detailed synopsis of Borges\u2019 \u201cTl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\u201d\u2014but where Borges\u2019 fiction tended to use the apparatus and affectations of scholarship in service of a kind of structural irony, Sebald\u2019s art is scholarly in a much more fundamental way. As Adam Phillips has put it, he was \u201cmore like a new kind of historian than a new kind of novelist.\u201d", "So one of the things that\u2019s always interesting about this writer is how close he seems to come, in his methods, to creating works of scholarship, and how far the books themselves are from the sort of thing typically produced by academics. In Sebald\u2019s essay collection", "originally published in German in 1998 but only now translated into English, there\u2019s a sustained proximity to, and distance from, straight scholarship. Reading it, I kept thinking about how its basic materials might have been incorporated into a more conventional academic text, how its various strands might be tied together into an overall argument about", ", or the themes of place and exile as they are manifested in same. How it might, in other words, present itself as that most humbly learned of cultural products,", "on some topic or other.", "The book is a collection of six critical essays, on five writers and one painter, which coheres into a thematic whole in ways that are often only glancingly apparent. Of the literary figures Sebald writes on here\u2014Johann Peter Hebel, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Eduard M\u00f6rike, Gottfried Keller, and Robert Walser\u2014only Rousseau and Walser are likely to be well-known to Anglophone readers. All are writers for whom Sebald holds a deep and abiding affinity, an \u201cunwavering affection,\u201d as he puts it in his short foreword to the book. That foreword inaugurates proceedings with a familiar Sebaldian note of autobiographical exactitude, a customary laying out of the specifics of place and time. \u201cI can still remember quite clearly how, when I set out from Switzerland for Manchester in the early autumn of 1966,\u201d he writes, \u201cI placed Gottfried Keller\u2019s", "Johann Peter Hebel\u2019s", ", and a disintegrating copy of Robert Walser\u2019s", "in my suitcase.\u201d \u00a0These are writers who have stayed with him, who have over time become part of his intellectual makeup, and he feels that he must \u201cpay my respects to them before, perhaps, it is too late.\u201d", "And this front-and-center placement of the personal is one way in which", "distinguishes itself from more traditionally academic modes of critical writing. It\u2019s tempting, here and there, to read these pieces as oblique works of self-portraiture, on the (probably spurious) principle that any writer writing about another writer is always, to some degree, writing about himself. Certainly, you do feel in these essays the gravitational pull of the historical preoccupations that characterize so much of Sebald\u2019s own creative work. Although the writers discussed are all figures of the 18", ", 19", "and early 20", "centuries, the Second World War is still an unavoidable presence here, like a sinkhole in the landscape of time into which everything on either side is always at risk of falling. (Sebald\u2019s books, with their oneiric logic and frequent invocation of the labyrinthine horrors of Europe\u2019s past, are a constant reaffirmation of Joyce\u2019s idea of history as a nightmare from which there can be no awakening.)", "\u201cThat\u2019s an abyss. Also an abyss. Another abyss. Yes, I\u2019m afraid these are all terrifying abysses.\u201d", "In the first piece, we see Hebel\u2014a popular German almanac author of the early 19", "century, beloved of Benjamin and Kafka\u2014listing figures to enumerate the vast devastation of the Napoleonic Wars. Sebald quotes him at length striking a distinctly proto-Sebaldian tone on the destruction wrought by the French occupation of Moscow: \u201cIf one stood and looked down from a height, as far as the eye could see there was nothing but sky and Moscow. Thereafter, nothing but sky and flames. For hardly had the French occupied the city than the Russians themselves set fire on all sides. A steady wind quickly spread the flames into every quarter of the city. In three days the greater part of the latter was reduced to rubble and ashes, and for anyone passing that way, there was nothing left to see but sky and desolation.\u201d", "European history is not, to Hebel or Sebald, a succession of linked occurrences, but one terrible event that is always happening, always echoing back and forth across time\u2014\u201cour history,\u201d as he puts it in", ", is \u201cbut a long account of calamities.\u201d Sebald suggests the possibility that Hebel may, in this way, have foreseen something of the disasters to come, that he may have \u201calready had a sense, in 1812/13, that the fall of Napoleon and the rise of the German peoples signaled the beginning of a downward path which, once embarked upon, would not be easy to halt, and that history, from that point on, would amount to nothing other than the martyrology of mankind.\u201d", "Photo by Isolde Ohlbaum/Random House", "Sebald has a way of viewing the world whereby seemingly minor misfortunes or cruelties are made to stand for catastrophes too terrible to be directly observed. Even the smallest of sadnesses seem to open onto an abyss. The collection\u2019s beautiful final piece, on the contemporary painter Jan Peter Tripp (with whom he collaborated on the posthumous book", "), contains a haunting evocation of death in the tiny particularity of a dead mouse, depicted in one of Tripp\u2019s eerily ironic still lifes. For Sebald, the dead always have something to tell us, and even this tiny corpse conveys its own \u201csilent message.\u201d\u00a0\u201cNestling in nothingness,\u201d he writes, \u201cwith neither ground nor background, the creature hovers now, its bat ears extended, through thin air. The black patch of fur around its eyes is reminiscent of a mourning band, or an eye mask worn by a sleeping passenger on a summer night\u2019s flight over the North Pole.\u201d The silent message conveyed by the dead mouse, and by the images in Tripp\u2019s work as a whole, is for Sebald a synecdoche for some unspeakable communication:", "This is, of course, a highly idiosyncratic definition of painting\u2014and one that obviously tells us a great deal less about the business of painting than it does about the writer\u2019s desolate view of life, and his sepulchral approach to art. (I have a cartoonish mental image of Sebald being presented with a succession of Rorschach cards by a caricature shrink, and calmly interpreting each blot in exactly the same way: \u201cThat\u2019s an abyss. Also an abyss. Another abyss. Yes, I\u2019m afraid these are all terrifying abysses.\u201d) It\u2019s hard not to read this reflection on the pathological investigations of visual art as mirroring back upon Sebald\u2019s own creative work, which is so alive with symbols of death, and which, in its sly and patient way, continually lays bare the dark inner lining of reality.", "Just as, in sketching the lives of six Swiss and German subjects, the essays travel back and forth over the Alps, the collection is itself marked by strange crossings between past and present, between the lives of the subjects, and between those lives and the author relating them. What draws him back continually to Hebel, he says, is the memory of his own grandfather, whose use of language reminds him of the writer\u2019s, and who used to jot down weather patterns and saint days in Hebel\u2019s almanac. (Photographs of these jottings are included in the text, as though to illustrate the ways in which the details of one\u2019s own past overwrite the image of a text in memory.)", "This grandfather reappears later in the book, in ghostly superimposition over the figure of Robert Walser. The Walser essay contains a clustered sequence of photographs of the writer at various ages\u2014\u201cstations in a life which hint at the silent catastrophe that has taken place between each.\u201d \u00a0Two of these images feature an older Walser holding the hand of a young boy, both of them clutching walking sticks and posing for the camera against a rural backdrop:", "There\u2019s an odd pathos to the interlocking associations of these photographs in Sebald\u2019s memory, and the somber movement of the prose as it gathers together its disparate elements, its transmutations. And of all the images alluded to here, it\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t appear on the page that has the strongest impact: the photograph of Walser\u2019s body in the snow, taken after he dropped dead of a heart attack on his last walk, in a field near the asylum where he spent the last 23 years of his life. That photograph would have made for a jarring insertion here, and perhaps a crass one; its absence is more haunting than its presence would have been. And by some occult means, it seems to reappear in the next essay, in Tripp\u2019s hyperrealistic depiction of the dead mouse, sprawled against the wintry emptiness of a blank background, and backed by the white light of eternity. In Sebald\u2019s writing, everything is connected, everything webbed together by the unseen threads of history, or chance, or fate, or death. The scholarly craft of gathering scattered sources and weaving them into a coherent whole is transformed here into something beautiful and unsettling, elevated into an art of the uncanny\u2014an art that was, in the end, Sebald\u2019s strange and inscrutable gift.", "---", "by W.G.
