{"Body": ["Photo by Kevin Sturman", "The most exciting-to-read works of journalism often betray little evidence of how tedious they were to report. Baroque murder trials come with thousands of pages of court transcripts. Corporate fraud is found in boxes full of financial documents. At the heart of high-stakes stories is usually a knot of red tape to untangle, tax records to line-check, reticent witnesses to draw out. Investigative journalism demands tenacity, but also a high tolerance for boredom.", "Janet Malcolm is great at being bored, maybe the best. Her books, many of them quite short, take her years to report and entail the sort of dull labor most people would abandon within minutes. For her second book,", ", she listened to hours of strangers\u2019 therapy sessions on tape; her third,", ", sent her to library stacks for months. Both required Malcolm to interview people whose entire professional success rests on them saying as little as possible. Her 1999 book,", ", tells the story of a disbarred lawyer wrongfully imprisoned for an escrow scam. The racket, which involved the buying and selling of dubious insurance, is a mind-numbing one. Malcolm repeatedly admits this\u2014\u201cI could almost have wept with impatience\u201d\u2014but, as always, ends up writing something riveting. Paperwork aside, it is the tale of one woman\u2019s self-damning inability to tell her own story. A decade later, in an interview with Katie Roiphe for the", ", Malcolm said, \u201c", ". I felt I could have learned German or flamenco dancing in the time I spent trying to get a handle on the crooked business deals.\u201d Reading those sentences on the heels of all her books brings a great wash of relief. \u201cPhew,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cshe\u2019s human after all.\u201d", "Malcolm\u2019s capacity for tedium and her apparently monastic approach to writing prevent her from figuring too heavily in the public imagination. She tends to stay away from news that everyone is already discussing\u2014and though most of her reportage uses the first person, she never offers us a romantic image of the journalist at work.", "Unlike Joan Didion, who is a worthwhile comparison if only for superficial reasons\u2014they are women of the same age who both write for the", "\u2014Malcolm does not inspire young women to", ", or", ", or spend hours looking at", ". Malcolm does not have", "devoted to her. She does not use the word \u201c", ",\u201d nor would she ever pen a grief memoir. Didion has said that her \u201conly advantage as a reporter\u201d is her small physical stature and unobtrusive temperament. Malcolm is also small, but she doesn\u2019t dwell on it. Reading her books, it\u2019s difficult to imagine Malcolm being brassy or loud or anything other than \u201cunobtrusive\u201d herself.", "Malcolm\u2019s severity, her terrifying neutrality\u2014like a teacher who is capable of handling even her most despised pupils no differently than the ones she secretly adores\u2014is part of what makes her a brilliant writer. It is also why her writing does not occasion adolescent reverence and why her image is not printed in fashion magazines. You discover Didion in high school and you read her on the beach. Malcolm you discover in college\u2014or after\u2014and read before you do your own work.", "Much like her public persona, the worlds Malcolm renders are almost eerily insular, seemingly untainted by pop culture or politics. Malcolm\u2019s single foray into mass entertainment, as far as I can tell, is", "\u2014the books, not the television series they spawned\u2014but even there she is unable to resist references to Nabokov and Trollope. In", ", her biography of Sylvia Plath, Malcolm writes: \u201cLondon itself had a hushed, emptied-out feeling. The Gulf War had begun a few weeks earlier; terrorism was feared, and travel had halted\u2014my hotel was three-quarters empty.\u201d Reading these two sentences, I feel as though I have just seen my internist at the movies. I can\u2019t recall a single other instance of the real world encroaching on the one Malcolm\u2019s has crafted and presented to us. Malcolm is a priestly figure; an aura of quiet surrounds her work. She is always in control.", "*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *", "", "Born in Prague in 1934, Malcolm and her family fled the Nazis and moved to New York City in 1939. She attended the University of Michigan, and\u2014in her words\u2014spent her youth running around with \u201ca group of pretentious young persons.\u201d They followed recipes from", ", shopped for modern furniture, and wrote \u201cmannered letters to each other modeled on the mannered letters of certain famous literary homosexuals, not then known as such.\u201d She began her journalistic career at", ", doing small, \u201cfemale\u201d assignments: covering children\u2019s books and interior decorating; once she published", ".", "Malcolm\u2019s first reported piece of nonfiction, about the new field of family therapy, appeared in", "", "in 1978. \u201c", ",\u201d like all her writing since, contains long quotations of her subjects and unapologetically highbrow references. The propensity toward quoting at great length reveals Malcolm\u2019s patience and unnervingly focused attention, but the second tendency\u2014that habit of alluding to everything from poststructuralist texts to minor Henry James novels to Italian operas\u2014demonstrates an even more impressive skill. Somehow, against all odds, Malcolm\u2019s erudition is not alienating. Reading even the most cerebral of her sentences, you feel smart by association rather than dumb by comparison. No doubt this indirect flattery comes into play when she interviews someone, too. A person who is made to feel stupid is probably unlikely to tell you much.", "Such flattery might get a subject to act against his own self-interest, something that journalists, according to Malcolm, do constantly. In one of the more famous lines ever published about journalism, she writes, \u201cEvery journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.\u201d That\u2019s the first sentence of", ", Malcolm\u2019s best-known book, published in 1990. On the surface, it\u2019s about the lawsuit filed by convicted murderer Jeffrey MacDonald against Joe McGinniss, author of a book about MacDonald\u2019s case. Throughout their interviews and correspondence, McGinniss led MacDonald to believe that the book would prove\u2014or at least make a case for\u2014his innocence. In fact, it did the opposite, suggesting that MacDonald slayed his family in an amphetamine-fueled fit. Malcolm\u2019s book is less about the case itself than what she sees as the depraved nature of all journalistic relationships.", "Did she see that story accurately? Malcolm would say that any story\u2014and", "a well-told and well-reported one\u2014is inevitably a distortion. Throughout her career, she has insisted upon this. \u201cThe realities of characters in fiction\u2014and of their cousins in journalism\u2014derives precisely from the bold, almost childlike strokes from which they are drawn,\u201d she writes in", ". And in one particularly disputed passage of", ", Malcolm writes:", "The briefest and slightest of inquiries on my part would bring twenty-page replies from MacDonald, and huge packages of corroborating documents. \u2026 I was oppressed by the mountain of documents that formed in my office. I have read little of the material he has sent\u2014trial transcripts, motions, declarations, affidavits, reports. ... I know I cannot learn anything about MacDonald\u2019s guilt or innocence from this material.", "Some find this jaded, postmodern attitude toward veracity appalling. The documentary filmmaker Errol Morris, for instance, has repeatedly taken Malcolm to task for making \u201c", ".\u201d Considering the stakes in the case of a murder trial, it is appalling, quite frankly. But it also makes for consistently provocative reading.", "*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *", "The essay that gives Malcolm\u2019s newest collection its title,", ", is made up of her own abandoned ledes for", ". Midway through \u201cfalse-start\u201d No. 35, Malcolm says to Salle, \u201cSomething should happen. There has been some action\u2014I\u2019ve been to your studio and your loft and to your drawing show and to the dinner afterward\u2014but I want more.\u201d In so doing, she lays bare an almost infantile need for material; there\u2019s a whiny quality to that \u201cshould\u201d and that \u201cwant.\u201d She also highlights matter-of-factly the fraudulence of profiles in general: The subject and the journalist construct an event together for the sake of retroactively describing it.", "Magazine articles seeking to expose the artifice of magazine articles are much discussed and often beloved. Lately,", "has been carrying the baton with winking celebrity profiles of actors like", "and", ". An entire chapter of Jennifer Eagan\u2019s", "is a sendup of this prankish mode. (\u201cWhy do I keep mentioning\u2014\u2018inserting\u2019 as it may seem\u2014myself into this story? Because I\u2019m trying to wrest readable material from a 19-year-old girl who is very, very nice.\u201d) Such articles\u2014\u201cfictional\u201d or otherwise\u2014can be funny and fun to read; there\u2019s a cynical pleasure in ferreting out the phoniness of the form. If Holden Caulfield grew up to become a journalist, these are the sorts of articles he would write. To point out, laugh at, and refuse to indulge conventions are the hallmarks of adolescence. But self-awareness, as most people over 17 know, is not the same thing as absolution. There is almost nothing worse than self-referential prose from writers enchanted by their own cleverness.", "But Malcolm never seems self-enchanted. For all her apparent skepticism about the possibilities of her profession, the fact is she has devoted her life to it, and\u2014in nothing I could find at least\u2014has she even once tried to defend her choice to do so. \u201cWe are certainly not a \u2018helping profession,\u2019 \u201d she has said. \u201c", ", to what our subjects don\u2019t realize they\u2019re letting us take.\u201d In", ", Malcolm writes that as a journalist, \u201cYou are only pushing a button, turning on a tap.\u201d And in", ", she compares biographers to burglars and describes the genre\u2019s readers as voyeuristic. Later, she says of her own writing that the \u201cpose of fair-mindedness, the charade of evenhandedness, the striking of an attitude of detachment can never be more than rhetorical ruses.\u201d What looks at first glance to be a condemnation, is in fact a confession. Throughout her career, Malcolm has unabashedly presented her own petty preoccupations (lost luggage, event-appropriate cookies), shallow assessments (of Sylvia Plath she writes, \u201cAll the photographs of her disappoint me\u201d), and vain humiliations (after asking a na\u00efve question of a group of scholars, she reports that she feels \u201clike someone who has ordered a cheeseburger at", "\u201d).", "Why doesn\u2019t her enthusiasm for convention-dismantling and self-deprecation\u2014a rhetorical ruse if there ever was one\u2014enrage me, the way this sort of thing frequently can? Why isn\u2019t Malcolm\u2019s guile-masked-as-candor embarrassing? Why do I trust her? Why do I even like her? She spends an awful lot of time confessing to her foibles, disparaging her profession, and challenging her readers to call her bluff. In theory, her antics should make us groan in annoyance. And yet Malcolm seems unassailable.", "", "*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *", "", "After reading Janet Malcolm\u2019s 11 books, and all her articles that haven\u2019t yet made it into books, I didn\u2019t know how to answer these questions. And so I proceeded to follow the advice I give friends when they are dumped: I tried to make a mental list of all of Janet Malcolm\u2019s worst qualities in an attempt to turn my simple adoration into a more complicated kind of affection.", "There are not many entries in that list, it turns out.", "Malcolm does seem almost addicted to simplistic similes. Her books are brimming with analogies to archetypes: evil sisters, dying patients, traveling snake-oil shows, \u201cthe idea of a death far away from home.\u201d One could argue that this is a deliberately facile way of presenting the world, but Malcolm, per usual, never stops examining the analogies she employs. As she writes in", ": \u201cThe narratives of journalism (significantly called \u2018stories\u2019), like those of mythology and folklore, derive their power from their firm, undeviating sympathies and antipathies.\u201d In this kind of reduction, she is attempting to distill an impossible amount of information, and owning up to it in the process. It is a form of generosity\u2014to the reader, if not to the subject.", "Malcolm frequently repeats herself. A quotation from Chekhov\u2019s 1899 story \u201cThe Lady With the Dog\u201d animates a section of", ", and the same story provides the opening to", ", written more than two decades later. It is also alluded to in", ", written 10 years after that. Dostoyevsky\u2019s Prince Myshkin serves her as a point of comparison when describing Seymour Glass in", "and the poet/art critic Rene Ricard in \u201c", ".\u201d Content from her early books on psychoanalysis routinely appears in later ones. When Malcolm describes a character\u2019s \u201ctransformation from a hysterically miserable man who hasn\u2019t fully grown up into an ordinarily unhappy adult,\u201d we know she is thinking of Freud\u2019s definition of goal of psychoanalysis (\u201cto convert neurotic misery into ordinary unhappiness\u201d) since she has quoted it in the past. Some readers might see such recurrences as symptoms of a limited imagination. More sympathetically, though, Malcolm\u2019s preoccupations can be considered evidence of developed taste and a coherent mind.", "Malcolm\u2019s persona\u2014as rendered by her\u2014is resistant to mockery, it seems to me. If you attempt to parody Malcolm\u2019s style, you just end up with better sentences. And if Malcolm hasn\u2019t defended her line of work, it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t need to. Despite all of her meta narratives about the artifice of journalism, she has managed to say true things about the world that her readers either haven\u2019t experienced or haven\u2019t thought critically about. This is her job description, and she fulfills it.", "*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *", "", "She has also, more recently, worked around it. In her 2011 book,", "Malcolm writes the story of Mazoltuv Borukhova, a doctor\u2014and Bukharan Jew\u2014 who is accused of hiring an assassin to kill her estranged husband after he is granted custody of their young daughter. Borukhova seems unequivocally guilty, and Malcolm is forced to summarize the case as the paradox it appears to be: \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have done it and she must have done it.\u201d As usual, Malcolm close-reads court transcripts and mannerisms, thereby demolishing both the sanctity of the law and entire personalities all at once. And the setting\u2014both the courtroom and the insular community of Queens, New York, where this tragedy plays out\u2014provides Malcolm yet another opportunity for denigrating journalism. \u201cHuman frailty continues to be the currency in which it trades,\u201d she writes. \u201cMalice remains its animating impulse.\u201d", "How much do Malcolm\u2019s critiques of journalism apply to her own work? This is the question one must often swat away when reading her books. The answer mirrors the Borukhova paradox: She couldn\u2019t be implicating herself and she must be implicating herself.", "is noteworthy for Malcolm\u2019s own involvement in the case, which no one could classify as malicious or morally feeble. The child\u2019s guardian\u2014appointed by the family court\u2014spouts deranged conspiracy theories to Malcolm during an interview, and she proceeds to offer her notes to a defense lawyer. \u201cI did something I have never done before as a journalist,\u201d she writes. \u201cI meddled with the story I was reporting.\u201d This fourth-wall-breaking moment is a testament not just to her allegiance to the truth but also to the idea that doing the morally right thing matters, and is possible even if you\u2019re a journalist. When the stakes are high enough, or less charitably, when her sympathies are whet, Malcolm seems capable of forsaking her clinical detachment and smudging her own picture.", "The final essay in her new collection is \u201c", ".\u201d It begins with a disclosure: \u201cI have been aware, as I write this autobiography, of a feeling of boredom with the project.\u201d Malcolm goes on for a few paragraphs about \u201cmemory\u2019s autism,\u201d \u201cthe atrophying (from disuse) of the journalist\u2019s powers of invention,\u201d and how she has \u201cfailed to make [her] young self as interesting as the strangers [she] has written about.\u201d In the last sentence, Malcolm refers to \u201cwhat follows,\u201d but then there is nothing more. The project, as the title suggests, appears to have been deserted. It\u2019s possible that memoir is precisely where Malcolm\u2019s patience finally sputters out: Only in turning herself into a subject is she bored to a degree profound enough that it paralyzes her. But it\u2019s difficult to read everything Malcolm has ever written and then come upon this orphaned autobiography and not see in it a kind of tease.
