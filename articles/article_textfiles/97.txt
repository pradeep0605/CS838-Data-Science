And a woman stopped me and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a book that I can read to my daughter that shows a family like mine. Someone should write one.\u201d By someone, she meant me. I grew up in the 1960s with no books about Jewish kids. I knew how alienating it could be to not see a family like yours in a book. You don\u2019t belong, you think\u2014there\u2019s no place for you, because your family is different, and our culture says difference is inferior rather than wonderful.

She told the director that she didn\u2019t want to him wearing the dress because he looked \u201cridiculous.\u201d Every day after that, for several weeks, the boy asked me where the dress was. Was it getting fixed? Cleaned? Eventually he figured out that the director had removed the dress on purpose so he wouldn\u2019t be able to wear it.
