But Hilburn\u2019s work is far and away the most insightful, entertaining, comprehensive, and well-told Cash biography to date.", "By now even casual fans are familiar with the broad-brush version of Cash\u2019s story: his older brother\u2019s death when he was little, haunting him down the years; the country and rockabilly hits in the 1950s followed by more crossover hits in the \u201960s and \u201970s; the famed prison concerts and the TV series\u2014but also the addiction to a variety of pills; the long, tumultuous, and loving professional collaboration with June Carter Cash; and finally, following a lengthy period of artistic and commercial irrelevancy, the late-in-life second act that allowed Cash to reconnect with a young audience and to resuscitate his near-dead reputation as a rebellious-yet-moral American artist.", "All this is consistent with the story Hilburn tells. But Hilburn also helps us see the Man in Black in something nearer to living color. It is not a pretty picture. Cash could be petty and insecure, and he was sheltered and self-centered in ways that only wealthy celebrities get away with for long. Cash got away with it, mostly, for much of his adult life, which is not at all to suggest that he and those closest to him weren\u2019t paying heavy prices for his behavior straight along.", "Cash was a neglectful and frequently frightening father to his children, and to June\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019d wake up and find the kitchen was on fire because he done something wrong while making breakfast,\u201d Carlene Carter, a future country artist in her own right, tells Hilburn of life with her stepfather when she was a girl. \u201cOr he\u2019d show up without his key and take an axe to the front door.\u201d", "Cash was, if not a serial liar, then at least a chronic embellisher: Some version or other of \u201c[Cash] wasn\u2019t inclined to let the facts get in the way of a good story\u201d becomes almost a mantra in the book. He treated his first wife cruelly; he had a not-so-secret affair with Billie Jean Horton, the widow of his dear friend Johnny Horton, and a longstanding not-secret-at-all affair with the woman who became his second wife, June Carter. His pill-popping nearly killed him on several occasions, and it persisted late into his life.", "I could go on but won\u2019t. Suffice it to say, for long stretches of", "", ", the protagonist comes off like a real asshole. If he weren\u2019t Johnny Cash, I\u2019d hate him.", "Of course, he is Johnny Cash, so I like him very much, flaws and all. Partly that\u2019s because I come to the book, as I suspect most readers will, deeply invested in Cash\u2019s music. It\u2019s also because I know the story will end about as well as could be imagined\u2014and Hilburn\u2019s accounting of Johnny and June\u2019s final frail days together is tremendously moving. At times he almost seems to be in the room with them, and perhaps he was: A key to Hilburn\u2019s success here is that he knew the Cashes personally from 1968 on\u2014he was the only music journalist to cover the recording of", "\u2014and interviewed them many, many times, including talks that took place not long before their deaths. Hilburn\u2019s decadeslong commitment to the Cash story is surely one reason why so many of Cash\u2019s friends, associates, and family members\u2014including Johnny and June\u2019s only child, John Carter Cash\u2014not only shared their memories with Hilburn for the project, but granted the author access to Cash\u2019s and their own personal correspondence.", "The letters to his wives and his children, and the annual letters he for years wrote to himself around Christmastime, are among the main reasons readers will root for Cash, even when he\u2019s just been at his worst. \u201cYes, congratulations John Cash on your superstardom,\u201d he chides himself in a 1972 note. \u201cBig deal!\u201d He cops to his faults and beats himself up for his failures. Again and again, the letters show a man trying very hard\u2014imperfectly, and only intermittently\u2014to be a better father, a better husband and Christian, a better man. \u201cYou stayed off pills but you\u2019re still awfully carnal,\u201d he tells himself in 1968. \u201cYou know what those little vices of yours are \u2026 You need to pray more. You hardly ever pray. Big deals ahead in 1969, possibly a network TV show, but the biggest thing you\u2019ve got is your family and home. You\u2019d better hang with God \u2026 \u201d", "He also wanted to be a better artist. \u201cMy primary focus is on [Cash\u2019s] artistry,\u201d Hilburn writes in the acknowledgments, and his book sometimes reads like an extended Cash discography, plowing dutifully through every album, as far as I can tell, that Cash ever released. This is sometimes dreary work: Cash\u2019s output in the 1980s was regularly uninspired, his artistic focus having gotten distracted by near constant touring, film projects, and Billy Graham Crusades.", "Photo courtesy Christopher Morris/Little, Brown Co.", "But some of the best moments come when Hilburn details how this or that song which is essential to Cash\u2019s legacy came into being. Many fans already know that the melody and much of the lyric to Cash\u2019s signature single, \u201c", ",\u201d was actually lifted, with few (albeit defining) edits, from a 1953 Gordon Jenkins recording, \u201c", ".\u201d Hilburn, though, has actually tracked down the man, Chuck Riley, who played that record for Cash while they were in the Air Force together. \u201cRiley had just bought the album at the PX, and he remembers Cash asking him to play it again,\u201d Hilburn writes. \u201cA few days later, Cash came back and borrowed the record to write down the lyrics or perhaps copy it on his tape recorder.\u201d Those details, combined with other bits and pieces of inspiration\u2014the film", ", a line from Jimmie Rodgers\u2019 \u201c", ",\u201d and more\u2014allow Hilburn to pin down the complex genesis of one of the last century\u2019s most indelible recordings.", "Insights like that come throughout", "", ". So what\u2019s missing? Surprisingly, given Hilburn\u2019s stated focus on Cash\u2019s art, it\u2019s the book\u2019s lack of attention to the music, as opposed to the lyrics. Hilburn always lets us know what Cash\u2019s songs were about; he quotes the words to some of the most famous Cash numbers almost in their entirety. But he offers only the most generic descriptions (\u201cplayful\u201d or \u201cupbeat\u201d or \u201caggressive musical backing\u201d) of how Cash\u2019s music actually sounds.", "The absence of any close listening here is doubly frustrating because anyone familiar with Hilburn\u2019s work knows he can be an adept critic.

The way his larger-than-life stories are grounded by life-size sonics, and delivered by that extraordinary ordinary voice. This is what drew people to Cash long before they knew much of anything about his personal life.
