{"Body": ["Illustration by Lilli Carr\u00e9.", "The novel sensation that unites any trip\u2014business or pleasure\u2014is how quickly the hotel becomes home. You swipe your keycard, flop face down on the bed, root around the minibar for snacks you won\u2019t eat, and assess the shampoo situation. Within moments you\u2019ve memorized the contours of your suite as though it were a childhood bedroom, and you treat it as such\u2014leaving laundry in piles and neglecting to turn the TV off.", "This is common sentiment.", "refers to the hotel\u2019s \u201csluttish core,\u201d and Geoff Dyer,", ", writes that in a hotel \u201cyou become a non-person and are granted an ethical equivalent of diplomatic immunity.\u201d (Although maybe not if you\u2019re Dominique Strauss-Kahn.) That ease is of course thanks to the teams of polyester-suited employees whose job is to maintain this adolescent unreality. The systemic sleights of hand that make up hotel life\u2014many of them nefarious\u2014are chronicled in Jacob Tomsky\u2019s new book,", ". Tomsky\u2019s M.O. is profane populism, and with it he cracks open hotelier extraordinaire Cesar Ritz\u2019s maxim that \u201cpeople like to be served, but invisibly.\u201d In so doing, Tomsky offers up insider tips, galling confessions, and just enough smut.", "If", "dissuaded you from ever ordering mussels again (remember how they \u201cwallow in their own foul-smelling piss\u201d?), then", "will make you question the sparkliness of complimentary flutes of champagne (shined with furniture polish) and pause before spraying your own cologne (potentially tainted with an employee\u2019s vengeful urine). Never again will you wonder why, when visiting New York, the phone in your room rang off the hook: You were rude when checking in and given room 1212 as punishment\u2014people forget to dial 9 to get out.", "Tomsky, who worked his way up from valet in New Orleans to Manhattan front-desk agent, is part shaman (\u201cI was infinite. All things to all people.\u201d) and part Patrick Bateman (\u201cService is about minimizing negatives and creating the illusion of perfection\u201d). \u201cHotels are methadone clinics for the travel addicted,\u201d he writes, and indeed, the book follows him to Europe and back again. However humiliating and tedious his duties, Tomsky remains resilient. What seems to buoy him despite rude patrons, incompetent managers, and deluded celebrities is the promise of outsize creative returns. Constant cordiality is taxing, but there\u2019s no arguing the fact that the infinite stream of guests makes for good fodder\u2014Faulkner too worked a front desk, after all, and Nathanael West wrote", "during his night shift.", "Tomsky\u2019s anecdotes are endless: a co-worker learning to drive stick shift on a guest\u2019s overnight ticket, a Pepsi exec who rents a block of rooms for a convention and demands that the Cokes be removed from all the minibars. And the fun facts are bountiful: Hotels\u2019 no-show rate averages 10 percent, which means hotels try to always book at 110 percent capacity. \u201cPutting a head in every bed,\u201d writes Tomsky, \u201cis called a \u2018perfect sell.\u2019 \u201d", "The book, which charmingly has no 13", "chapter, is cut through with detours, many of them more interesting than Tomsky\u2019s actual memoir. Early on, he gives a microhistory of hotels in America, which were nonexistent until after George Washington embarked on his first presidential tour and insisted\u2014for the optics\u2014on staying at local taverns rather than with friends. He was disgusted with his lodgings, and a new industry was born. Later, we get the origin story of the wheeled suitcase and a riff on how it \u201cinstigated a catastrophic change,\u201d turning now-obsolete bellmen into \u201canachronistic hunters\u201d who \u201croam the plains of lobbies across the world, starving for a kill.\u201d", "At his best, Tomsky is at once fratty and industry-specific: An occupational hazard of hotel work is \u201cgetting a Samsonite to the balls.\u201d But he can also be unexpectedly literary, as when he compares hotel hallways to ghost towns, \u201cdoors wedged open by abandoned carts, not a houseman to be found.\u201d", "Mostly though, he\u2019s the guy who saddles up next to you at the hotel bar and doesn\u2019t stop talking.", "Though almost cartoonishly obscene, Tomsky is not particularly prurient. He speculates that one frequent guest is a prostitute and talks about finding \u201cbondage gear still attached to a towel holder that had been ripped out of the wall.\u201d He mentions purposeful robe slips and \u201cguests who must have heard me knock, guests who seemed to climax at my embarrassment.\u201d But otherwise, he\u2019s less excited by imagining guests\u2019 sexual appetites than he is enraged by their rudeness. It\u2019s possible Tomsky is just desensitized, having spent his entire adult life proximate to people who are aroused, if only circumstantially. But it\u2019s a shame that the book isn\u2019t sexier.", "Tomsky\u2019s freewheeling swagger\u2014\u201cKidnap me, duct tape my face, drop me out of a plane, and I promise you I will land in a parking lot adjacent to a hotel and in less than a day I\u2019ll be wearing a suit, assisting guests, earning a nice check, and making friends at the local bar\u201d\u2014 can feel, at times, like overcompensation for the fact that his life has not much changed. He still works at a hotel, and as in any tragicomedy, escape seems impossible.", "is not a redemptive tale, nor is it told with much distance. Mostly\u2014though tacitly and maybe unintentionally\u2014it\u2019s about the degree to which youthful inertia can determine a whole life.", "Courtesy of the author.", "For a brief moment, Tomsky considers quitting the racket and getting a job in publishing. But no luck: \u201cI had been like some prostitute trying to get a secretarial position, only to have the interviewer come around the desk, get uncomfortably close, maybe lay an inappropriate hand on my knee, and say, \u2018Look. You\u2019re a whore. You\u2019re a", "whore. Why don\u2019t you stop messing around and get back to working the corner, huh? Come on, baby, it can\u2019t be that bad, can it?\u2019 \u201d", "Tomsky abridges his book at the end, offering a series of explanatory \u201cappendixes\u201d (", "): \u201cThings a Guest Should Never Say,\u201d \u201cThings a Guest Should Never Do,\u201d \u201cStandard LIES That Spew from the Mouth of a Front Desk Agent,\u201d etc. And while the pr\u00e9cis is fun, it\u2019s arguably self-defeating: It\u2019s like getting all the good bits from Tomsky\u2019s surely-hoped-for", "show appearance, while rendering the previous 234 pages a bit moot.
