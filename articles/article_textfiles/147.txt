Reading the book, you begin to realize that comedy writers are disproportionately miserable", "", ". Here is how professional comedy writing works, according to the book: A talented and funny person\u2019s brain is under constant assault from insane deadlines, fickle audiences, humorless executives, and the constant threat of abject failure. Most of the writers featured in", "say they love their horrifically stressful jobs. Still, simply reading about the manic pace James Downey, Mike Schur, Adam McKay, and the other writers in the book keep up for months on end nearly gave me a panic attack. Immersing myself in professional comedy writing for all 453 pages of", "in a row was as harrowing as it was jealousy-inducing.", "I might have been suffering flashbacks from my own brief professional comedy-writing career. From 2009 to 2010, I contributed to the", ", the", "\u2019s first online video series (later a short-lived TV show on IFC). I had to come up with roughly 15 ideas for video segments each week, written in the dry", "headline style, and email them in.

I had never even seen an episode of", ". So I began to study comedy like chemistry. One of my most valued desk references, along with Woody Allen\u2019s", "and Jack Handey\u2019s", "scripts, was Mike Sacks\u2019 first book of interviews with comedy writers,", ".", "That book, published in 2009, contains no useful tips on \u201chow to be funny,\u201d and neither does its sequel. Anyone approaching", "as a comedy manual is going to be sorely disappointed. Advice in the book mostly consists of vague bumper sticker slogans\u2014\u201cJust keep writing,\u201d says Diablo Cody. Cool, thanks!\u2014or completely contradicts another writer\u2019s advice. Even the idea of what comedy", "differs wildly from one interviewee to the next. Terry Jones, of Monty Python, likens comedy to the ineffable magic of poetry: \u201cFor both poetry and comedy, the concepts have to be boiled down, and the essence is what you want to say.\u201d No, says Tom Scharpling, creator of", ": Comedy is a cold, hard \u201cmath problem,\u201d and the writer\u2019s job is to fill in a familiar pattern.", "Suggestions for writing techniques are just as widely varied. Longtime", "writer James Downey argues sustained effort does not necessarily lead to good comedy: \u201cYou can spend hours and hours and focus and hard work and pain, and a piece will still not be good.\u201d But for Mel Brooks, creating a script is akin to painstakingly chipping a figure out of marble. \u201cRewriting is writing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s everything.\u201d And both Brooks\u2019 and Downey\u2019s takes ring true to me. Most of my", "ideas were won through long hours lying on my bedroom floor mulling hundreds of premises while one of the best things I\u2019ve ever written,", ", simply popped into my mind one day, almost fully-formed.", "The bottom line is you cannot teach someone how to be funny. (This point is also frequently made in the book, in between all the advice on how to be funny.) Comedy writing is a lot like knocking down a wasp\u2019s nest with a tennis racket. You just have to get really drunk and start doing it. If your blows land and your body can absorb the toxins of hundreds upon hundreds of excruciating stings, you may wake up from your pain-induced coma one day and find that you are a comedy writer. Or you limp away, hideously disfigured, and become a journalist.", "In my studies, I discovered only one useful comedy-writing tip ever. Jack Handey", "that he wrote his brilliant \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d by lying on the ground and repeatedly throwing a rubber ball at the ceiling in a trance. After reading this I ran out and bought a foam football and began writing all my jokes horizontally. I did get slightly funnier.", "Comedy writing is probably the most totally commoditized form of creative writing outside of advertising copy.", "The true usefulness of", "to an aspiring comedy writer is in its clear-eyed picture of the gritty inner workings of the comedy industry.

Reading about how a joke goes from the mind of a writer to an episode of", "is like watching a magician reveal his secrets: Sure, it dispels some of the magic, but it inspires new reverence for the real skill that went into producing the effect. These interviews disabuse the aspiring comedy writer of any overly precious ideas that comedy has much use outside of being hammered into a usable product. When I began writing jokes I had just graduated from college and held this romantic idea of comedy as a kind of search for truth, which I\u2019d lifted from a freshman classics seminar. I was a huge Aristophanes fan, not only because the dick jokes in", "are hilarious, but because I figured that anything an ancient Greek dude did was automatically timeless and important. By writing my own dick jokes for the", "I imagined I was quaffing of the same golden chalice as Aristophanes, plucking penis-shaped truths from the ether. I even remember getting excited about how court jesters were the only ones who could criticize the king in medieval courts, or some crap like that.", "But reading battle-scarred comedy writers talking about their work makes it quite clear that comedy is a business more than anything. Comedy writing is probably the most totally commoditized form of creative writing outside of advertising copy. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange business,\u201d says", "writer Mike Schur in the book.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s really where the rubber meets the road\u2014the rubber being art and the road being commerce.\u201d Nobody\u2019s pondering the difference between the", ". They\u2019re too busy pulling all-nighters to stuff more jokes into a script before shooting begins the next day.", "Television requires such huge amounts of new content that the system has to run like a factory, endlessly shoveling jokes, plotlines, characters, and premises into the consumer\u2019s slack-jawed face. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this very creative, often very personal thing, but you\u2019re expected to produce in this totally noncreative way,\u201d says Dan Guterman, a writer for", "and", ". \u201cMy job is to churn out comedy, which is this intangible and temperamental thing, but at the rate and consistency of an assembly-line worker.\u201d Holding too tight to any lofty ideals about comedy guarantees you will be crushed and relegated forever to the role of cautionary tale: the \u201cfunny friend who didn\u2019t make it\u201d that every comedy writer seems to offer up.", "The only way comedy writers can produce such an inhuman amount of material without going insane is through the alchemical power of the writers\u2019 room. The writers\u2019 room has taken its place alongside NASA\u2019s control room and the New York Stock Exchange trading floor as one of the sacred spaces of American ingenuity, thanks to", ", and also", ".", "further bolsters the idea of the writers\u2019 room as a temple of creativity\u2014a glorious combination of gladiatorial arena, group therapy session, and nuclear bunker. A bunch of funny people locked in a room trying to make each other laugh and getting paid for it\u2014what could be better than that? When I read", "\u2019s Mike Schur explaining the thrill of a good joke \u201cclicking\u201d and sending a roomful of veteran writers into window-shaking laughter, I wanted to drop the book and get back to work on my spec script.", "There is glory to be found in the writers\u2019 room, but also an almost-familial warmth.\u00a0 \u201cYou are sharing 14 hours a day with the same people, and having the same conversation all day long. You need to learn what role you play every single day in that configuration,\u201d says Kay Cannon, a", "writer. The ecstatic way in which writers talk about the community that forms in the writers\u2019 room reminded me, oddly, of Occupy Wall Street and the idea that the encampment at Zuccotti Park was a test-tube utopia, the one tiny space in the big, horrible world where things work roughly according to how they would in the best possible world. In the writers\u2019 room you become a better person while you help other people be better, and you all work to create something great. Damn.

I can think of a few explanations for the sunnier attitude of Sacks\u2019 second book. It features younger and less-experienced writers who might not have the standing to fire off broadsides the way Bob Odenkirk did. Or maybe comedy writing has truly become more creatively fulfilling. But the upbeat attitude could also reflect a less positive trend in the industry: The growing need for content even as competition from low-budget reality TV forces networks to cut corners on writing staffs. These pressures, combined with an influx of aspiring writers willing to work for next-to-nothing, have resulted in an increasing reliance on freelancers, non-union employees, and other precariously employed writers.", "I was one of them.
