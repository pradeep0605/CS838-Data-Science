The characters are precocious tots and gruff but loving elders, moony romantics and folklorical shtetl inhabitants. There are splashes of cuddly experimentalism and oodles of Hallmark pathos, like the kid who, after 9/11, imagines a \u201cspecial drain\u201d under every pillow in New York City designed to funnel tears into the Central Park reservoir. Everyone\u2019s pain is picturesquely sentimental, the stuff of sighs, not screams. Foer\u2019s early work drifts dangerously toward kitsch.", "on the other hand, worms its way closer to the squirmy kernel of Foer\u2019s talent. Its subject\u2014marital disintegration among the cultured urban bourgeoisie\u2014is endearing to exactly no one. Jacob and Julia Bloch, a novelist-turned-TV-writer on a", "\u2013type series and an architect-turned-renovation-consultant, live with their three sons in a townhouse in Washington, D.C. Once consumed by their own specialness (the family has cute, idiosyncratic rituals like wandering around the house with their eyes closed to celebrate Shabbat), the couple have become estranged for reasons not entirely clear even to themselves. Julia\u2019s discovery of the burner phone from which Jacob sexts a colleague only precipitates the collapse of their union; the fissures in it run deep. Meanwhile, Jacob\u2019s grandfather, a Holocaust survivor, needs to be moved into an assisted living facility. His father, Irv, a stridently pro-Israel blogger and political gadfly, berates him. Sam, his eldest son, prefers pretending to be a Latina girl in an online community called Other Life to \u201clife on the crap side of the screen\u201d and has to be dragged kicking and screaming to his own bar mitzvah.

Every Muslim nation from Algeria to Yemen declares war on Israel, and the prime minister summons adult men from the worldwide Jewish diaspora to \u201ccome home\u201d and fight. This happens during a visit to the U.S. by Jacob\u2019s Israeli cousin, Tamir\u2014a comically hairy, muscular, and robust contrast to Jacob\u2014who gets stranded in the Blochs\u2019 guest room after all air travel into the region shuts down. Between Tamir and Irv, Jacob suffers a steady stream of lectures about his deficiencies as a Jewish man. Jacob\u2019s self-assured Israeli relatives, he thinks enviously, \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to give a shit about anything. All Jacob\u2019s family did was give shits. They were shit-givers.\u201d", "Let\u2019s not make too much of this geopolitical subplot, however. Yes, one section of the novel is titled, hyperbolically, \u201cThe Destruction of Israel,\u201d and largely consists of speeches made by the prime minister and an Iranian ayatollah. But Foer never brings this drama from background to foreground; it\u2019s ghostlike and theoretical, the undercurrent to Sam\u2019s long-delayed bar mitzvah, the ceremony by which Jewish boys enter manhood. The distant war and his crumbling marriage push Jacob to face all the ways he has failed to grow up himself. The core of the novel isn\u2019t the war but a memory from Jacob\u2019s childhood: his father removing the corpse of a decomposing squirrel from the family doorstep. \u201cIt was so gross. I couldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d the boy says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a dad, there\u2019s no one above you,\u201d his father explains. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do something that has to be done, who is going to do it?\u201d One day, he says, Jacob will do it, too. \u201cThe more you won\u2019t want to do it, the more of a dad you\u2019ll be.\u201d", "The Culture Gabfest\u2019s producer explains why radio drama isn\u2019t dead. \u00a0Listen to this special Slate Plus bonus segment by joining \u2013 your first two weeks are free.", "circles and circles the paradoxical mystery of the distance between Jacob and Julia. \u201cThey loved each other\u2019s company, and would always choose it over either aloneness or the company of anyone else,\u201d Foer writes, \u201cbut the more comfort they found together, the more life they shared, the more estranged they became from their inner lives.\u201d The pair rarely have sex. He feels rejected, and she feels that responsibility for the entire functioning of family rests on her shoulders, so she daydreams by designing perfect houses for solitary occupants. He pines for the first flush of their love, when (in a suspiciously idealized memory) he was once able to bring her to orgasm by staring at her genitals, but now he can rarely get it up and broods over how seldom she touches him, praises him, or laughs at his jokes.

Jacob keeps absurd little secrets from Julia to make himself appear better in her eyes, and those secrets metastasize into big problems. Foer links Jacob\u2019s outwardly ingratiating and covertly resentful bond with Julia to the posture of any Jew of the diaspora: Irv blames Jacob\u2019s neglect of Israel and waste of his talents writing for \u201cthe epic dragon adventure of someone who isn\u2019t fit to spit shine your hemorrhoids\u201d on \u201cthe same mistake we\u2019ve been making for thousands of years\u2026 believing that if we can only be loved, we\u2019ll be safe.\u201d Jews who live on the sufferance of Gentiles can never be truly secure: \u201cDoes anyone really doubt that one day, when the conditions are right, America will decide we\u2019re noisy, and smelly, and pushy, and way too smart for anyone else\u2019s good?\u201d", "The metaphor is intriguing, but forced: Marriage isn\u2019t a nation you\u2019re born in or move to but something you build from scratch with a partner. This political gloss on a private misery can come across as an imitation of the social novels of Jonathan Franzen, just as the scattered passages of dirty talk and reveries on masturbation seem to ape Philip Roth.", "is strongest when it dares to be unlikeable in its own, funny way, as in Jacob\u2019s ruthless, hapless description of negotiations with Julia: \u201cHe would have to avoid saying things that could be used against him at any further point, as everything would be entered into the permanent record. He would have to appear to yield (with gentle affirmations, and declared reversals to positions he already secretly held) without giving an inch. He would have to have the cunning of someone too cunning to read a book about the cunning of the samurai.\u201d", "Jeff Mermelstein", "Whenever Foer isn\u2019t trying too hard, isn\u2019t avidly polishing away the particle of bitterness that gives his writing its particular, genuine charm\u2014whenever, that is, that he ceases trying to charm\u2014", "becomes a novel well worth reading. It is, alas, too long, largely because Foer seems unable to end it without delivering at least a dozen life lessons. Jacob loves podcasts, and the final chapters reveal a fondness for those annoyingly paradoxical, uplifting homilies so often used to wrap up an episode of the artier strain of the form: \u201cWhat can make religious people and parents so utterly insufferable is also what makes religion and parenthood so utterly beautiful: the all-or-nothing wager. The faith.\u201d Or \u201cYou only get to keep what you refuse to let go of.\u201d Or \u201cLove isn\u2019t the absence of struggle. Love", "struggle.\u201d And so on. These become exhausting, as if Jacob and possibly Foer were hammering away at the truth to fashion a satisfying moral to the story.
