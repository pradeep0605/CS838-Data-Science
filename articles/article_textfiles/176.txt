It was a one-woman show where she alternatively talked and sang, and the format did not suit her. Her tragedies, such as they were, were not compelling, or at least she did not tell them in a compelling way. \u201cIn addition to sacrificing introspection for inspirational homilies (\u2018God has never let me down\u2019),\u201d", ", who at the time was the", "\u2019 lead drama critic, \u201cthe star regards her personal history from an omniscient and self-deifying perspective.\u201d Lee was a great self-mythologizer, and one who\u2019d given so many interviews by that point that she could perhaps be forgiven for confusing good press with good theater, in retrospect.", "But then, the whole thing was cursed from the get-go by her insecurities. Gavin tells of a producer bringing Elizabeth Taylor to a backer\u2019s audition, hoping her mere presence would \u201cloosen [investor] purse strings.\u201d The strategy was a sound one but it obviously implied to Lee that she needed a booster shot of glamour to make her life an appealing commercial project.", "And as Lee began singing through the show, Taylor lit a cigarette. Lee \u201ccoughed lightly\u201d to try to get Taylor to stop smoking. It didn\u2019t work.", "Lee would finish the audition, but it was an agreed-upon disaster. Her confidence in the project fatally wounded, the rest of the process would see her oscillate between extreme self-aggrandizement and explosive temper. She kept trying to introduce her own verse into the ever-changing script, but even then could not remember her lines. The production staff became frustrated with her and mocked her appearance. (Gavin has them passing notes like, \u201cSHE LOOKS LIKE TRUMAN CAPOTE IN DRAG.\u201d)", "But on closing night, she said to a full house, \u201cI love it here, I wanted to stay.\u201d", "Gavin\u2019s biography positions the disaster of the entire affair as the fault of Lee\u2019s eccentricities and difficult temper\u2014this is a biography written by someone who is very uncomfortable with the mercury in his subject\u2014but it feels like he misses the pathos in the middle of it, the part where someone so celebrated is in possession of almost no self-esteem at all.", "Contrast that disaster, after all, with the fact that the central feature of Peggy Lee\u2019s singing is control. And by that, I don\u2019t simply mean the way she could hold an audience\u2019s attention. For one thing, she sang at relatively low volume. Like a number of other singers, Lee benefitted from the use of microphones; belting was no longer a required skill to be heard over the band. \u201c", ",\u201d inarguably her most famous track, is mostly purred. Even the small, exclaimed \u201cfever!\u201d lines are not terribly", ". All of her singing testifies in favor of \u201cless is more.\u201d", "But the seductive qualities of her voice were often related to that control, too. It let her appear to be holding something back, to adopt that woman-of-mystery pose. She sang like someone people should want to know more about, but like someone who would not, necessarily, answer their questions. Sometimes she presented herself as someone who didn\u2019t even", "to talk about herself. She did her most haunting work on lyrics like those in \u201c", ", where the speaker adopts a performative indifference to the tragedies she sees behind her:", "There is, of course, no doubt that Lee\u2019s style was not quite inborn. Early in her career, she, like any budding artist, imitated the artists she admired, sometimes to the point of them no longer finding it flattering. Gavin attributes some of her early singing style to Bing Crosby. And he notes that Billie Holiday, who came to know Lee a little, allegedly had to have a line excised from her biography: \u201cShe stole every goddamn thing I sing.\u201d", "Yet Gavin has curiously little to say about how the politics of race play into that. Lee was, after all, a white woman singing in a genre that has gone down in popular musical history as being appropriated from black people. Perhaps he hesitates because Lee\u2019s big break came when, in the early 1940s, she was picked up by the Benny Goodman band, and Benny Goodman had a reputation for wanting to better integrate his sets.", "But it must have had some effect\u2014even Gavin admits that one reason", "was less compelling than Lena Horne\u2019s show was that, \u201cwhereas Horne\u2019s show told the epic tale of a woman who had mirrored and influenced decades of social history, Lee\u2019s story was essentially all about her.\u201d", "That seems like pretty nice, if wholly vague, way of putting it, actually.", "But even setting aside the racial politics, Lee had an extraordinary streak of luck in her rise to stardom. She simply began singing professionally at the age of 16 and never stopped. First a radio station picked her up, then a Fargo dinner club, then the Benny Goodman Band, and solo records followed close upon. Though she claimed all her life to be worried about money it seemed like something always came through; she got less than the normal amount of rejection one expects to encounter in any artist\u2019s biography.", "Her fans were always numerous, and always loyal. Her ascent from nightclub singer to phenomenon had few rocks. From the beginning she was inspiring headlines like \u201cStranding of Youngsters Blamed on Pop Corn and Peggy Lee\u201d in the 1950", ". When she decided to do a film,", "(1955), she was immediately nominated for an Oscar for her performance.", "Photo courtesy Michael Childers", "Lee\u2019s story wasn\u2019t without obstacles, though. The problem was that they were mostly internal. Born Norma Egstrom in South Dakota in 1920 to a mother who would die by the time Lee was 4, she clearly grew up in a chaotic household. Her father had steady work as a railroad engineer, but he married a woman named Min whom young Norma clearly considered something of a wicked stepmother. Tales of Min\u2019s abuse pop up in Lee\u2019s confessional interviews for the rest of her life, and form a central part of", "and Lee\u2019s rather self-serving autobiography.", "Poor Gavin spends a lot of time trying to sort truth from fiction about these stories. But parsing that seems a waste of time for a woman whose penchant for self-mythology was so acute. The image of herself as somehow under siege is the key to empathizing with her. It poisoned four marriages. It made her the kind of friend who clung to you one minute and slammed the door in your face the next. It made her complain that she was not given proper credit for the lyrics to \u201cFever\u201d while simultaneously refusing to give credit to another co-writer. It made her feel like her legal battles\u2014which included a famous, precedent-establishing lawsuit over her songwriting in", "\u2014were biblical struggles. And it made her the sort of person who could not handle the possibility of being overshadowed by Elizabeth Taylor.", "Point being: In many ways Lee got such a good run on this Earth, and her anxiety would not let her stop to see or enjoy it.", "Her body itself became a reflection of that. All her life Lee suffered from both psychosomatic illnesses and real ones. Some were induced by alcohol and drug use, but also by the exhaustion of performing and the strain of singing so much.", "A 1952 interview in the", "found her offering advice on weight loss, adopting the \u201cright attitude,\u201d the importance of using a cosmetic brush to unclog your pores. And then at the bottom of the article an offer was made to readers:", "Gavin has an irritating way of imitating the press obsession with Lee\u2019s appearance, carefully noting every time Lee\u2019s curves waxed and waned. But he is not misrepresenting the way in which it threaded through her life as a celebrity. \u201cYou are thinner than when I saw you last,\u201d a reporter actually records herself saying to Lee in the", "in 1959. You have to keep in mind that she was, literally,", ", not quite the flattering gesture one dreams of receiving from one\u2019s public.", "So if by the end of her life, as Gavin records, Lee was caking herself in makeup and going on crash diets and staying in bed, it is not hard to understand why. What he finds \u201cstrange\u201d is hard not to see as actually the result of a life spent depending on the good opinions of other people.
