{"Body": ["Illustration by Frederik Peeters", "The book that most riveted me this year is Amanda Lindhout's story of being kidnapped for 460 days in Somalia, written with the fabulous Sara Corbett. Lindhout was a travel lover who was trying to transition from cocktail waitressing (she saved her tips for plane tickets) to journalism, on her way to report on health education for women outside of Mogadishu, when she was abducted by men determined to ransom her. Have you read", "of the years she spent in captivity, or", "? With no disrespect to either, this book goes much, much deeper. It includes a heart-pounding escape attempt, Lindhout's insight into her captors, and the seeds of her recovery. Somehow, since coming home to her native Canada, she has launched a foundation to help Somali women. Here's a", ". Her fortitude and honesty has stayed with me and taught me. Pick up this book and I promise you'll understand why.", "Rosemary, the narrator of this sweet, sad novel, had a decidedly unconventional childhood: For the first six years of her life, she was raised alongside Fern, a chimp, as part of a psychology experiment. Through Rosemary and Fern, Fowler explores how sibling relationships define us\u2014and how foggy childhood memories and guilt can confuse our personal narratives.", "This cheerily dystopian tale, centered on the rise of an omnipotent corporate hybrid of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, drove me nuts. The characters are cartoonish and cringingly na\u00efve, verging on idiotic. They routinely fail to see either their company\u2019s megalomaniacal id or the plot\u2019s heavily telegraphed twists. And yet, somehow even those narrative flaws left me with what I suspect is a roughly accurate portrait of Silicon Valley\u2019s techno-utopianism. Eggers\u2019 Kool-Aid\u2013guzzling programmers, happily working 24/7 at their EPCOT-like campus, keep popping into my head every time I read about Google\u2019s latest, no-doubt well-meaning effort to do our thinking for us. We\u2019ll drive the car; you just sit back and shop \u2026", "This book of poetry by American poet and playwright O\u2019Brien is powerful, inventive, and utterly original in the way it plumbs the numbing horror of being a witness to war. A collaboration between O\u2019Brien and Canadian war reporter Paul Watson, who won the Pulitzer prize for his photograph of a dead U.S. soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu,", "is visceral, disturbing, at times consoling, and always honest. O\u2019Brien\u2019s work is an incredible achievement. Anyone who cares about how we go to war\u2014and how we return\u2014must read it.", "Don't let the fact that this novel is set at a boarding school and features a 15-year-old protagonist fool you into thinking it's for young adults\u2014this alluring and engrossing tale is suspenseful, vivid, and erotic. I'm a sucker for historical fiction with strong female characters, and this is a standout in the genre. While the book was marketed as a romantic summer read, you'll enjoy becoming wrapped up in Thea Atwell's world any time of year.", "It's not quite the book that tells you everything you think you know about political campaigns is wrong, but it is a necessary corrective to the personality-driven and hyperventilating accounts of presidential campaigns driven by a news media out to sell half-baked narratives. An eminently readable book, despite the fact that it is written by political scientists and published by an academic press.", "If you love birds, nature, or wildlife art (or love somebody who does), this gorgeous book is the splurge of the season. It reproduces 150 of Audubon\u2019s finest plates in exquisite detail and in a generous 21-by-14-inch edition, using plates commissioned in 1858 by Audubon's family but whose publication was halted by the Civil War. The opening biography explains why he was one of the greatest adventurer/explorers of U.S. history.", "is 472 pages long\u2014good-sized pages, too, and the font is fairly small. The setup\u2014several young Americans and Brits spend a few years after college in post-Communist Prague\u2014is unoriginal, and not that much happens, really. Which goes to show that none of those things matter when the writer is someone on whom, as Henry James once said, nothing is lost. Caleb Crain is that sort of a writer, and this novel, which recounts the coming of age and gradual uncloseting of an authorial alter ego, reconstructs a time spent in one place with exquisite, unsentimental detail. On Page 8, Crain describes some cheap Czech croissants, which are \u201cstraight, like swollen fingers, because at some point, under socialism, the traditional curve had been eliminated as frivolous.\u201d I knew then I would like this book, and 464 pages later, finishing it was a bittersweet thing.", "The", "writer George Packer strives for crazy heights\u2014weaving a crisscross narrative of post-meltdown dreams and nightmares in the style of John dos Passos'", "\u2014and, remarkably, he succeeds. His chronicles of the Iraq war, superb though they were, put on hold the literary ambitions unfurled in his 2001 family-memoir cum political history,", ", but", "marks a return, plus some. His portraits of ordinary and extraordinary Americans in our own time of trouble exude a rhythmic flair, ranging from staccato to elegiac, that bring to mind an Ellington suite. It won this year's National Book Award for non-fiction, and deservedly so.", "This Shanghai-based journalist\u2019s globe-hopping exploration of the worldwide trade in garbage and scrap is both an illuminating tale of a lucrative industry most people are barely aware of and, more surprisingly, an affecting memoir. Minter intersperses on-the-ground reporting from sprawling Chinese scrap yards and scarily high-tech American trash-sorting facilities with childhood memories of growing up around the Minnesota junkyard run by his father and grandmother. It doesn\u2019t sound like it should work, but in fact, it does exactly what books like this are supposed to: show how massive economic and environmental trends impact individual lives. You won\u2019t think about the \u201cpaper or plastic\u201d question in quite the same way again.", "I don\u2019t usually go for ripped-from-the-headlines novels, but Jennifer DuBois\u2019 fictional account of an", "\u00ad\u2013like character doesn\u2019t just make for a riveting read; it makes you think about how you read.

There\u2019s a lot we know, but like the Knox case, there\u2019s a lot we\u2019ll never know. The question is what we do with that information.", "This chilling story looks like something you might pick for your youngster, befitting a work from the author of", "and the", "comics series. The protagonist is a precocious bookworm of 7 who befriends an older neighbor girl. But given that this page-turner lays bare all the terrors of childhood, I recommend you keep it from the kids unless you want them to stay up late reading\u2014and then crawl into your bed, asking to sleep with the lights on and the door open.", "One of the few", "(along with longtime Oakland Raider Emily Yoffe) to play in the NFL, Jackson is a wise, funny, profane tour guide to the strange world of pro football. It\u2019s a rare gift to have such a keen observer document America\u2019s favorite game from the inside. After reading this book, you\u2019ll want to thank the former Broncos tight end and\u2014what with all the injuries and jerky coaches\u2014maybe send him a sympathy card.", "This beautifully researched and written book asks and answers more questions about modern Israel than any book I can ever recall reading. Halevi takes on conflicts that seem to have only one side, sensitively presents them through seven different sets of eyes, then reveals how each of the seven men he follows is himself riven and conflicted.\u00a0His paratroopers and their dreams for what Israel has been and might become rise and descend like the angels in Jacob\u2019s dream.", "It\u2019s rare that a book can entice both the stomach and the brain. In his gorgeous novelistic travelogue,", "not only in conveying the beauty of French food as experienced by its most famous American devotees, but also in arguing that over the course of a few dinner parties in the French countryside, those people would transform that venerable cuisine into something new\u2014a fresh way of cooking and eating that we\u2019re still enjoying 50 years later.", "is categorized on its back cover as \u201cmemoir/anti-memoir.\u201d The label is confusing in a helpful sort of way: Any attempt to taxonomize the book\u2014or Solnit\u2019s work as a whole\u2014is going to be problematic and contradictory, because it doesn\u2019t properly belong to any one form, but of all the forms it doesn\u2019t belong to, memoir is probably the one in which it\u2019s most comfortably not at home. It begins with Solnit\u2019s mother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis, before departing on a meanderingly essayistic exploration of family, history, travel, memory, and storytelling. It refuses to be any one thing, or to stay in one place, for any length of time, yet it amounts to a coherent and moving narrative experience. It\u2019s a beautiful performance of controlled waywardness and (pretty much hands down) the best new book I read all year.", "One of the most singular books I read this year\u2014a book that left an indelible impression on me\u2014is Karen Green\u2019s", ", a lyric elegy for a husband who took his own life", "Comprising both visual collages and elliptical prose entries,", "is a lament for a lost love, by turns yearning, acerbic, resigned, and alive with protest. Green\u2019s husband was the writer David Foster Wallace, though he is never mentioned by name; the book is a triumph on its own terms.", "For years, I resisted this writer's zero-degree reports on emotional weather, and for years his cultivated persona (a matter of glassy Warholian froideur, self-medicated stuntwork, and hipstocratic\u00a0bushwa) greatly aided the endeavor. But this novel\u2014about coming of age, about traveling to Taiwan, about going nowhere\u2014is not to be denied,\u00a0and I swallowed its atmospheric anomie Houellebecq, line, and sinker. The trick is in its timing\u2014in the pixelated rhythms of the paragraphs and in its sense of how\u00a0city life calibrates one's own sense of time.", "Moustachioed Canadian space traveler Chris Hadfield\u2019s book is", "by someone who has achieved the near-unachievable, packed with stories and great advice for attaining your own less-than-cosmic goals. It\u2019s a pretty good thing to have your feet on the ground when your head\u2019s above the clouds.", "Phish and Insane Clown Posse are the two most reviled and ridiculed bands in America. Nathan Rabin spent two years immersed in the subcultures surrounding the bands: the vague and wobbly stoners who follow Phish, and the motley, lawless Juggalos who create primal havoc at ICP\u2019s annual Gathering.", "is awesomely funny, but what\u2019s most remarkable is Rabin\u2019s portrait of the poor, slovenly, excessively tattooed dropouts and weirdos who follow ICP. I\u2019ve rarely read something that was so good at understanding and building empathy for such an unlikely group.", "This novel unspools the mystery of a horrific dance hall fire as witnessed by different townfolk in rural Missouri.\u00a0Woodrell, who also wrote", ", has more than a little of Flannery O'Connor's Southern spit and gothic wit.\u00a0And at 164 pages, it's blessedly short for the English major home on winter break trying to keep up her chops.", "It\u2019s rare enough to see a sequel in the same league as its predecessor, let alone when that sequel is to one of the most popular novels of all time, from one of the most popular authors in America, over 20 years after its release.

A highly satisfying read.", "The Chelsea Hotel has sheltered artists, bohemians, and weirdos ever since it was built in 1884 by a disciple of the French utopian philosopher Charles Fourier. Tippins traces the hotel\u2019s history from its Gilded Age origins through its heyday as a center of postwar countercultures from Beat to punk, and into the real-estate development limbo in which it now resides. This smashingly entertaining book tells the story not just of a building, but of an idea.", "Although I\u2019ve long been aware of Rechy\u2019s autobiographical novel about a young gay hustler plying his trade around the United States, I didn\u2019t pick it up until Grove Press issued a 50", "anniversary edition this November.

Katz is a superb, perceptive writer, something that makes even encounters with well-covered celebrities (Bill Clinton, Sean Penn) more informative than the average #longread profile. He weaves in a love story, and he breaks real news, all on the way to capturing a horrific event you\u2019ll no longer be free to forget.", "For sheer forward propulsion, nothing I've read in a long time has matched this novel.
