Nothing even comes close.\u201d", "Timothy White", "The facts check out, at least insofar as Lehrer\u2019s claims derive directly from published academic work. In particular, he draws many of his figures from a well-known pair of studies, one that began in 1975, based on 267 high-risk families in Minnesota, and another that kicked off in the late 1930s and followed the lives of 268 male Harvard undergraduates. Citing data from the Minnesota study, Lehrer notes the extraordinary fact that 32-year-old adults who, as infants, had not been securely attached to their parents were almost", "more likely to say they had a chronic illness.", "The fact that this statistic came from scholarly work\u2014in this case a", "rather than a published paper\u2014doesn\u2019t necessarily make it true. Even when he\u2019s behaving like an ethical, honest science reporter, Lehrer is only as reliable as his source material. And in this case, his source material has limitations.", "I called up Jay Belsky, an expert in child development at UC\u2013Davis and a proponent of attachment theory, to ask about the Minnesota study. He told me it was an important data set, but noted that the study followed a very specific group of kids in a very specific time and place (as all studies do). Furthermore, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a study where the findings [on attachment] are stronger than they are in much of the similar literature.\u201d", "Indeed, meta-analyses of the research on attachment theory\u2014which attempt to combine results from many studies instead of focusing on just one\u2014find that Lehrer\u2019s \u201craft of benefits\u201d may in fact be slight. Recent evaluations of the literature typically find a \u201c", "\u201d for early child-caregiver attachment on", "such as", ". In other words, attachment does make a difference, but the studies that Lehrer cites (fairly and accurately, no doubt) could overstate the case.", "The same uncertainty arises in Lehrer\u2019s treatment of the Harvard study, and its former head, George Vaillant. Men who lacked a warm relationship with their mothers were 2\u00bd times more likely to experience dementia down the road, Lehrer says, citing Vaillant\u2019s work. Men from loving homes earned 50 percent more money. Men who were better at attachment lived longer. \u201cThe capacity for love turns out to be a great predictor of mortality,\u201d Vaillant tells him in an interview.", "Again, this is honest journalism\u2014Lehrer draws his claims from actual research. But when I looked at", "of Vaillant\u2019s work, I found a host of quirky findings. It turns out that among the Harvard men, having a warm father correlates with enjoying one\u2019s vacations more, and being more satisfied with life at the age of 75. Having a warm mother had no effect on these variables. Meanwhile, a mother\u2019s warmth in childhood seemed to make the Harvard men more effective at work late in life, whereas their fathers\u2019 warmth did no such thing. With so many variables in play\u2014their mothers\u2019 warmth, their fathers\u2019 warmth, their chances of dementia, their enjoyment of vacations, their happiness at any given age, and many other measures taken all throughout their lives\u2014I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if these associations might be spurious. Could they be nothing more than arbitrary patterns in the data that happened to comport with Vaillant\u2019s pre-existing, psychoanalytic theory of the world? It would take more than Lehrer\u2019s dutiful transcription\u2014telling us what Vaillant says\u2014to find out.", "Fact-checked, straight-laced science journalism may also fail to catch distortions of the evidence, if those distortions come from researchers themselves. Lehrer spends several pages on the work of Angela Duckworth, whose best-selling book on \u201cgrit\u201d came out in May. In that book and elsewhere, Duckworth has", "; now Lehrer makes similar, exaggerated claims. Duckworth \u201cdemonstrated the importance of grit in loving relationships,\u201d he writes, by collecting data from 6,362 middle-age adults who were either married at the time, or had been married at one point in their lives. Her study found that \u201cgritty men were 17 percent more likely to stay married.\u201d From this he concludes that love requires inner strength and that grit will shape our closest relationships.", "But as Iowa State University psychologist Marcus Crede pointed out to me by email, that statistic is a bit misleading. First, it glosses over the fact that when Duckworth looked at all the people in her study, grit had no effect at all. (It only seemed to matter when the women were excluded from analysis.) Second, by focusing on", ", it makes the effect seem bigger than it really is. Looking at the paper, it seems that among all the men in Duckworth\u2019s data set, about 80 percent were still with their spouses. Her statistics show this rate was slightly higher for the grittier men, at 82.4 percent. That is to say, the gritty men were just a few percentage points more likely to stay married\u2014a much smaller effect than Lehrer gives, quoting from the paper.", "Analogous mistakes appear elsewhere in", ". In one example, Lehrer touts a study showing that children with highly involved biological fathers are \u201c43 percent more likely\u201d to get very good grades in school. His endnote shows he pulled that figure from a", "published by the U.S. Children\u2019s Bureau in 2006. But a closer look at the research cited in that booklet\u2014a 2001", "from the Department of Education\u2014suggests it would be more accurate and more clear to say the likelihood that these children will get good grades goes up by 9 percent, not 43 percent.", "Has Lehrer really changed?
