For 48 years she has been holding on to a thick reddish folder, tied by string, full of musings by her teenage self. She hasn\u2019t given the contents much thought, but she is dimly aware that they contain a description of several incidents in her young life\u2014one, in particular \u201cso strange, so cataclysmic\u201d that she never spoke or wrote about it at all. The big one took place when she was asleep in a car with her brother and a friend in the cinematically named desert town of Lone Pine. In the wee hours, she wandered out onto the empty street alone, and\u2014well, as Ehrenreich writes, \u201cHere we leave the jurisdiction of language, where nothing is left but the vague gurgles of surrender expressed in words like \u2018ineffable\u2019 and \u2018transcendent\u2019 \u201d:", "Ehrenreich tried to bring it up with intimates a couple of times, once blurting out, \u201cI saw God,\u201d but that felt untrue and caused people to get awkward and change the subject. She was afraid people would think she was schizophrenic or otherwise crazy, and ultimately her rational self decided these experiences had nothing to do with adult life; they belonged instead to the make-believe \u201crealm of gods and fairies.\u201d Until at 59, her children grown, the last of her male companions dismissed, and fresh from a deep depression, Ehrenreich decided to transcribe the whole journal, and came upon this insistent question posed by her 13-year-old self to her future, aging one: \u201cWhat have you learned since you wrote this?\u201d", "One of the great pleasures of reading", "is seeing older, cranky Barbara encounter younger Barbara, sometimes with pride and patience and sometimes with disdain. She is aghast, for example, that young Barbara found an Agatha Christie book to be \u201cvery exciting with an excellent plot,\u201d but she obviously admires 16-year-old Barbara\u2019s list of things that fascinate her, including \u201cbees, straight lines, the ocean,\u201d and \u201cTchaikovsky, Liszt, Borodin, Ravel, Debussy,\u201d and \u201cthe line \u2018", ".\u2019 \u201d Although Ehrenreich stoically resists any self-pity, the source of her unsunny temperament is clear: an alcoholic and sometimes emotionally abusive father and an abandoned and manipulative mother who committed suicide after several tries. Morose curiosity animates her youthful journals: \u201cI have lately been considering,\u201d teen Barbara writes, \u201cthe utter futility of the lives of almost every living thing.\u201d", "Before we fund the NIH panel, I\u2019d like to propose an alternative arrangement for the events of Ehrenreich\u2019s life.", "Embracing her secret allows Ehrenreich to make some wise late-life course corrections. She is as disdainful of organized religion as ever, writing that when people run up against the inexplicable they call it \u201c \u2018God,\u2019 as if that were some sort of explanation.\u201d And she insists that \u201cthe idea of a cosmic loving-kindness perfusing the universe is a serious, even potentially dangerous error.\u201d But she also seems to back away from her atheism, portraying it as just another arrogant belief system she inherited from her father, a man she sums up as the \u201cgreat man-god and Shiva-like genius of self destruction\u201d and a \u201chabitual liar.\u201d", "In fact, what she seems to be backing away from is certainty of all kinds in the face of genuine mystery. A former chemistry student, Ehrenreich is particularly harsh on the brand of \u201cscientific reductionism\u201d that reduces mystical experiences to the misfiring of neurons, a completely internal event. Because half of all Americans claim to have had one, Ehrenreich scolds the scientific establishment to consider that maybe these are genuine encounters with an external consciousness, with \u201csome mystically potent being or beings.\u201d\u00a0 Experience \u201crequires me to keep an open mind,\u201d\u00a0 she writes, and then ends the book on a decidedly ufological note: \u201cI have the impression, growing out of the experiences chronicled here, that it may be seeking us out.\u201d", "Who knows, maybe It is? But before we fund the NIH panel, I\u2019d like to propose an alternative arrangement for the events of Ehrenreich\u2019s life. Mystical experiences are indeed common and widely accepted. You can read about them in any", "; William James included a chapter on them in", ". But a mature mystic understands that they are a spiritual error, even a potentially dangerous one. There is a famous story of a Buddhist monk who encounters one of his acolytes looking dazed, drained, and also ecstatic. The acolyte tells him he\u2019s just been consumed by a flame. (There is almost always a flame in such stories!) The senior monk looks sad and replies, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His worry is that the acolyte will now spend his life agonizing over that moment of ecstasy and find the daily life of a monk unbearably dull by comparison\u2014that he will become, in other words, the monk\u2019s version of a drug addict, constantly looking for his next high. It\u2019s critical to", "to the mountaintop, and to have seen the Promised Land.

Her illuminating experience wasn\u2019t really a secret; it was the animating force of her life, even if she never spoke about it. Where else would Ehrenreich have gotten the sense that she had a special mission, that her assigned task was to \u201chold the world together\u201d?\u00a0 To her credit, Ehrenreich did not spend her life chasing and wondering about the flame.
