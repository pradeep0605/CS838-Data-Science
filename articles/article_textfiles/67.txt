It was, I noted, published by the art book publisher Phaidon, and it looked fancy. I was already imagining the memories he would have of the book in 30 years\u2019 time: the images, the feel of it in his hands, the smell of its pages.", "\u201cThis one is interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cShall we take a look?\u201d", "We flicked through the beautifully illustrated pages.

It tells the story of the three above-mentioned cloaked and hatted robbers, who stalk the roads of an unnamed land \u201csearching for victims.\u201d Above this kingdom of easy quarry, after long nights of threatening and plundering and blinding horses with impunity, they hide out in a cave stacked high with treasure chests of loot. One night, the robbers intercept a carriage that is carrying only one passenger, an orphan girl named Tiffany who happens to be on her way to live with a wicked aunt, and who therefore welcomes as a reprieve the appearance of these shadowy figures. We are told, with eerie simplicity, that \u201csince there was no treasure but Tiffany, the thieves bundled her in a warm cape, and carried her away.\u201d (Ungerer\u2019s illustration is disconcerting: One of the robbers hauls off a gold-ringleted Tiffany, who is apparently sleeping peacefully. The robber\u2019s eyes are closed, too, as though bearing her off into some kingdom of dreams.)", "Phaidon", "When Tiffany awakens the next morning, she discovers the vast stockpile of treasures in the robbers\u2019 cave, and asks them the best possible question to ask of accumulated wealth: \u201cWhat is all this for?\u201d", "They\u2019re not sure, it turns out; they seem to be pulling off heists purely for the love of the game. Under the influence of Tiffany, the robbers then pivot their whole business model toward philanthropy, and set off to \u201cgather up all the lost, unhappy, and abandoned children\u201d they can find, buying a beautiful castle for all the children to live in. In one of the book\u2019s last images, the robbers oversee a phalanx of these gathered-up foundlings as they file happily into the castle, all dressed in blood-red cloaks and hats styled identically to the robbers\u2019 black clothing. The book ends on a cheerful note: As the orphans grow up and have children of their own, a settlement of red-uniformed villagers eventually forms around the castle. \u201cThese people people built three tall, high-roofed towers. One for each of the three robbers.\u201d The final image is of this village, lit by a full moon, its three towers echoing the silent presence of the robbers themselves.", "It\u2019s a happy ending, in its way, but one that is all the more ambiguous for its cheerfulness. There is no comeuppance, no catharsis, no moral resolution of any sort. My wife\u2019s unease about the book is not easily assuaged, nor, I suppose, is my own. The book generates a lot of questions, not the least of which is the question of what is actually going on. Since when is kidnapping children OK, even if they\u2019re on their way to live with a wicked aunt? Are we to view these robbers, who only a few pages back were smashing carriage wheels with giant red axes and aiming blunderbusses at the faces of the bourgeoisie, as suitable caregivers for an entire village of lost children? What\u2019s with the red uniforms\u2014are we dealing with some kind of cult here? Why does Tiffany, having initially been presented as a likely candidate for protagonist, disappear entirely in the final third of the book? And perhaps above all, why do we never see the robbers\u2019 faces? Why in the book\u2019s final image are they transformed into three looming towers, even more blank and mysterious in their last appearance than in their first?", "To be troubled in this way, to be bedeviled by ambiguities, is the hallmark of an encounter with a work of art. And this is what sets", "apart from any of the other picture books I have so far read to my son. It isn\u2019t that some of those other books aren\u2019t legitimate art in their own right; it\u2019s that there is something of the actual world\u2014the uncanny murk of lived reality\u2014in the volatile fantasy of Ungerer\u2019s story. He seems to take an almost malicious pleasure in denying you, the parent, the possibility of any straightforward moral decoding of his work.", "\u201cThey\u2019re good guys and bad guys at the same time,\u201d my son put it one evening, a remark that\u00a0 seemed to me to be about as much as could be said of most non-imaginary people, including both of us.
