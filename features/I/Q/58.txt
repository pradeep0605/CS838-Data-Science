I'm posting this review on I need to never run into Scott Westerfeld down a dark alley, or during a Civil War reenactment, or at Charlton Heston's house, or wherever. My deep desire not to be arrested for murder would have an epic battle with my need to reach for a weapon when I see his stupid face. In all fairness, as you see, I coughed up three stars for this book, so I will clarify that my empty threatening is really directed toward Pretties and Specials (books two and three in this series). I'm posting this review on the link for the first book in the hopes that it will inspire people to put this book on their list of books never to read. If you read this book there is the danger that you may want to continue with the series, but trust me, you really don't. In listing what I don't like about this series, I'll start with EVERYTHING from the characters to the plot to the worldview that I imagine would inspire a story of this kind of depth and breadth of ambivalence. The premise of <+++>Uglies</+++> is that in the future when kids reach puberty, they all have mandatory plastic surgery to turn their bodies into a perfect standard of beauty based on human brain reactions to visual stimulus. Unfortunately (and this is a slight spoiler, so my apologies, but it really is an element that is pretty obvious from page one, though not clearly stated until later), when the kids are having the surgeries to make them pretty, the surgeons change their brains, too, to determine their decision-making abilities, capacity for independent thought, and even sense response. Basically, the pretty surgery makes most people stupid, unless the occupation that the government determines for them requires intelligence. So far so good - it's your basic government-takeover dystopia. Yes, kids, if you let the government give you free health care checkups, it's only a small step to the day they start chopping up your brain. Luckily, said ugly teens (particularly our protagonist, Tally, through her bff, Shay) discover that if they flee to the wilderness, they will be able to live a life of freedom and romance. Oh, what's that? Did I say \"romance\"? Thanks again Jean-Jacques Rousseau , Percy Bysshe Shelley , Ralph Waldo Emerson , et al. Sometimes when characters go out into the wilderness . . .<---F> I don't even know</---F>. Does the phrase \"it's been done\" even begin to cover my feelings on that topic? Thus begins the cat-fight between Tally and Shay that is the uniting thread of this entire series. You see, there is a wilderness boy (imagine my surprise), who is quite a catch even though he's \"ugly\", and there's some jealousy and betrayal and kick-ass hoverboarding. You get the idea. Let me clarify the problems I have listed so far: 1. Suspicion of the city, using a retreat to the wild as the solution to social ills. It's a tired premise. 2. Cattiness of the female protagonist and portraying the central female character as mostly driven by her current crush and competition with other women. That is a huge pet peeve of mine. Those, however, are small, forgivable wrongs compared to the basic disingenuousness of the moral arguments Westerfeld makes. While he on one level criticizes the idea of basing society on a hierarchy of physical looks, the characters repeatedly interact within that hierarchy, calling each other \"pretty\" and \"ugly\" at every turn and defining \"pretty\" people very specifically. Even the repetition of the words \"ugly\" and \"pretty\" undercuts any message Westerfeld might have against pigeonholing people. I found myself seeing people in the grocery store and evaluating whether they met the \"evolutionary definition\" of pretty as according to this series. It's creepy and annoying. Westerfeld can be as showy as he wants about how it is limiting to judge people based on their appearance, but I argue that he is actually encouraging that same shallow judgment if only by instruction and repetition. For example, it's like saying, \"kids, don't shoplift, but here's how to shoplift if you ever want to do it. And here's a catchy shoplifting song to sing with your group of friends, who really should have a name. Hey, we could call you guys the 'shoplifting gang'! Don't shoplift, though.\" What's the real message there? Ultimately, the arguments of the government that requires the pretty surgeries, also, make a lot of sense in the stories. The surgeries solve anorexia, bring world peace, and save the environment. Plastic surgery sounds fun, too, and Westerfeld literally makes no compelling arguments against body alteration. At the same time, I'm left feeling that Westerfeld thinks it is a bad idea, though he is not convincing. If Westerfeld's discussion of body image wasn't enough of a travesty, the point in this series where this backwards arguing makes me want to wipe him off the face of the planet is when he introduces cutting. By \"cutting\" I'm not talking about skipping school. If you are not familiar with cutting, it is a form of self-mutilation that has been growing in popularity with teenagers over the past few years (I'm going to go ahead and say it's been growing in popularity since 2006, when the book Specials was published). In Specials, our catty female protagonist and her buddies discover that by slicing up their arms, they experience a particularly satisfying high, and all of their senses are strengthened. Ultimately, they randomly decide that this is a bad idea, but Westerfeld only implies their reasoning for that decision, and again I'm left with the feeling that probably everyone should be a cutter because in the context of the story it's pretty badass. I think that was the point where I started yelling and throwing things around my house. Unfortunately, some parts of these stories are actually engaging (not seriously engaging, but passably), and for a while I wanted to find out what happened to everyone, even while I wanted to burn the author's house down. The truly unforgivable wrongs are his wolf-in-sheep's-clothing discussions of teen body image and self-mutilation issues. His characters never develop deep self-respect or intelligent motivation for their actions, and even when their decisions seem healthy, Westerfeld makes a better argument for the unhealthy decisions. Now I realize that I didn't even talk about the uber-annoying slang language he develops for the Pretties and Specials. I'll just say that these books are not \"bubbly\" and leave it at that. ...more So my wife and I occasionally swap books which may seem a little kooky.

That used to be me...I miss you Locke. As for me, I didn\u2019t find a love connection with this book. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think the story has some wonderful qualities that I can respect it but there wasn\u2019t going to be a \u201clet\u2019s do this again sometime\u201d in our future. However, even though I didn\u2019t go all Lamar and Chloe on this book, I do still owe my wife a HUGE debt of gratitude. Why you ask? Because if she wanted to be a nasty ms she could have chosen for me to read Twilight which would have caused me all kinds of trauma. Honey\u2026.you are just too good to me. Anyway, there have been so many other excellent reviews of this book that detail the plot that I will just give a brief synop before telling you what I think. The story involves a future dystopia in which everyone, at age 16, is radically transformed using extreme plastic surgery to become \u201cpretty\u201d\u2026..kinda like The OC. The theory is that by removing all distinctions based on physical appearance, you will also remove the jealousy and bias from society and make everyone sunny and sexy. I thought for the most part that it was an excellent way to exploring themes of youthful angst about fitting in and larger issues social conformity. While not as good as other YAs I\u2019ve read, I thought that the world envisioned by the story was fresh and promising and fit within the framework of the novel. In other words\u2026I thought it worked. I also thought that as the story unfolded and we learned more about the TRUTH behind the society and the real purpose for the transformative surgery, the story became a lot more interesting. That said, there are two main reasons why I couldn\u2019t rate this higher than I did. First, the pace was much too turtle-like for me and events seemed to take way too long to wrap up. It just made it impossible for me to slip into the story. However, the biggest chunky in the punch bowl for me was the main character, Tally, who I found annoying. She drove me completely cranky for most of the book and it is tough to find win if the main biddy is giving you a case of the grumps. However, to her credit, Tally did begin to redeem her image towards the tail of the book and there are preliminary indications that she may upgrade into a more compelling protag in the subsequent novels. However, in this one, she was lugging around a minus sign more often than not. So, overall, excellent back-story and interesting world building give me some reason to think that the sequels might be worth a gander at some point. I just pray to George Burns that Tally can grow out of her \u201cbugging me phase\u201d and that the pace could hit the accelerator in subsequent installments. On final comment that probably affected my feelings about this book. I recently read an incredibly powerful short story called Ponies: A Tor.Com Original that covered many of the themes in this book. That story was only TWO PAGES long and yet conveyed a MUCH MORE POWERFUL message. Just my opine. 2.0 to 2.5 stars. ...more I\u2019ve only seen one episode of The Twilight Zone. In this episode, a woman undergoes a battery of surgeries to look normal. At the end of the episode, viewers learn that this latest surgery has failed: the woman is still hideous. Except that to the audience she is beautiful. Online research led me to another episode where teenagers are surgically altered to live longer and conform to a unified standard of beauty (based on a limited number of acceptable \u201cmodels\u201d). \u201c<+++>Uglies</+++>,\u201d Scott Westerfeld\u2019s dyst I\u2019ve only seen one episode of The Twilight Zone. In this episode, a woman undergoes a battery of surgeries to look normal. At the end of the episode, viewers learn that this latest surgery has failed: the woman is still hideous. Except that to the audience she is beautiful. Online research led me to another episode where teenagers are surgically altered to live longer and conform to a unified standard of beauty (based on a limited number of acceptable \u201cmodels\u201d). \u201cUglies,\u201d Scott Westerfeld\u2019s dystopic novel, plays similar games of perception. The novel starts with Tally Youngblood a fifteen-year-old girl desperately waiting for her sixteenth birthday when she will be reunited with her best friend and, more importantly, when she will finally be pretty. \u201cUglies\u201d is set in the distant future after a mysterious global catastrophe precipitated changes to the foundations of what readers would call modern society. Fearful of war and violence cities now operate as independent states (think Renaissance Italy as opposed to contemporary Italy). Isolated and self-sufficient, the cities have agreed to certain standards for the greater good. New technology ensures that citizens never want for food or luxury items, weapons of any kind are largely illegal, and at the age of sixteen everyone undergoes a series of extreme surgeries to better conform to societal standards of beauty. The logic being that, since humans are preconditioned to respond to certain visual cues in each other already (big eyes are non-threatening, a clear complexion and good teeth indicate that a person is healthy), applying these beauty standards will reduce conflict and create a more harmonious society. But in a world where everyone is movie-star-gorgeous (oldies like Rudolph Valentino and Greta Garbo are considered \u201cnatural pretties\u201d), normal people are so not pretty. In short, they\u2019re ugly. Things change for Tally when she meets Shay, another Ugly girl, who wants to run away before the operation to a place called The Smoke where people can live like \u201cRusties\u201d (that would be us basically) in the wilderness without any surgery. As the novel progresses, and Special Circumstances (a government agency) coerces Tally into finding The Smoke for them, Tally is forced to choose what means more: friendship or beauty? As the plot might suggest, this is a science fiction novel. Just to be clear, the real difference between sci-fi and fantasy is that the technology in science fiction novels could conceivably work if someone ever built it (dragons, most likely, are never going to be genetically engineered so they\u2019re a good indicator of a fantasy novel). At times this leads to more explanation of, say, hoverboard mechanics in the novel than is strictly necessary to the plot but the rest of the book makes up for this small shortcoming. What makes \"Uglies\" great, besides how it looks at cultural values, is Westerfeld\u2019s use of language. The novel is not pretentious or brash. Instead, Westerfeld creates a narrative voice that is really unique\u2014especially for a sweeping sci-fi saga like the Uglies trilogy. The novel opens with Tally observing that \u201cThe early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\u201d That is not, it is fair to say, a typical opening for any novel. Yet Westerfeld moves from that observation seamlessly into the story. This book is the first in the Uglies trilogy (followed by \u201cPretties\u201d and \u201cSpecials\u201d) which focuses on Tally and her city. The scope of each book can largely stand alone, but to get the full story it\u2019s best to read the entire trilogy. Additionally, Westerfeld released a companion book to the trilogy last year called \u201cExtras\u201d which is set a few years after the trilogy with different main characters. \u201cUglies\u201d is simultaneously funny and frightening, showing how overvalued beauty can be while illustrating how Tally\u2019s world has been conditioned to believe there\u2019s no other way to live. The sections where Westerfeld describes the Rusty Ruins and the end of that era are particularly haunting (and eerily reminiscent of the History Channel\u2019s recent documentary \u201cLife After People\u201d). Sci-fi book discussions often bring up a writer\u2019s \u201cworld building\u201d in reference to how well a writer creates their alternate universe. Westerfeld\u2019s world is built really well. The cities have their own culture, the characters their own slang, but Westerfeld manages to bring in enough references to our own contemporary culture that it\u2019s easy for readers to believe Tally\u2019s world is built on the ruins of our own. ...more EDIT : One thing I forgot.

I'm even more angered at this book when I think about the trees that gave their lives for this so-called piece of literature. May they rest in peace. Nope, couldn\u2019t finish it. Sigh. I thought I was going to like this one. It started off fine and all. And then everything fell apart. Yes, that dramatic. Am I the only one who was deeply offended by this piece of crap ? This book is wrong, wrong, wrong. The writing itself isn\u2019t particularly\u2026 well, isn\u2019t anything really. But this is supposed to be a book about beauty with a big B and the writing doesn\u2019t do justice to the theme. I\u2019d even call it Ugly. The characters are stereotyped. Tally is a brainwashed moron. Okay, she was raised to believe the ideology of her country but she cannot think by herself. She wonders whether to betray the Smoke, the rebellious uglies, and you know what helps her make the right decision? A boy. Woohoo, thank God he was there, with his adorable crooked smile, his sweet kisses, and his handmade leather shoes, otherwise I really would have thought that she was an immoral bitch. This also means that the fate of an entire city depends of the hormonal state of our young hero. DUDE! The boy himself is\u2026 phew, of course he thinks Tally is beautiful, special, strong, smart, unlike anyone else when she is, in fact, so flat that I could surf on her back. In fact, she\u2019s \u201cthe only one who truly understands\u201d. Pleaaaaaase. He was raised to be a very careful, and independent thinker, but he falls for the first pair of boobs he encounters and turns out to be a spy. Good job. Shay was the best character until Westerfeld reduced her to some kind of stupid Lolita. She, who expressed interesting and deep (as much deep as this book can be) thoughts became a giggling, na\u00efve, brainless chick whose only interest is, of course, the boy with the handmade leather shoes. Anyway, let\u2019s move on to the real problem. The content has almost nothing to do with the premise. The book is full of ecologist propaganda. Westerfeld keeps telling us how bad, bad, BAD things we, humans, are. He calls our generation the Rusties. Isn\u2019t that nice? He criticizes everything we do. Oh, wait, no, he praises the invention of the Roller Coaster! We\u2019re bad because we use metal, we\u2019re bad because we\u2019re savages who eat animals and because we \u201ckilled every living thing\u201d. Well apparently not, because there are a lot of forests and flowers despite our destructive frenzy. I was going to quote some passages but the words are so offensive I just can\u2019t. We\u2019re freaks, we\u2019re ugly, and we\u2019re wrong. This must not be the message intended but it\u2019s all I got from this book. It\u2019s like Westerfeld wants us to go back to some primitive way of life. He doesn\u2019t criticize our mistakes, he condemns progress. He\u2019s not warning us, he\u2019s trying to shove his dogma down our throats. He\u2019s telling us \u201cI\u2019m right, you should believe me, because I detain the truth.\u201d I deeply love nature and also fear for its future, but I want to believe that mankind has an equal capacity for creation and destruction, for beauty and ugliness, for right and wrong. It\u2019s depressing to read about how hopeless we are. Westerfeld lacks delicacy, neutrality. He\u2019s not objective. \u201cNature, at least, didn\u2019t need an operation to be beautiful. It just was.\u201d How about us? Aren\u2019t we part of nature? Aren\u2019t we beautiful, then, the way we are? For Westerfeld, this is Nature versus Mankind. He takes us apart from it, he draws a line between the Earth and our species. I believe that everything that lives on Earth is connected, that we\u2019re a part of a whole. If you really want to write about nature and man, you shouldn\u2019t make them opposite. Instead, look for what makes us part of the earth, what connects us to the rest of the world, the plants, the animals. We are a part of this planet, we are nature and culture. I believe that it is where lies the true beauty of our condition. I want to believe that some of us can see that, that we will realize how important nature is, not because it just feeds us or that flowers are pretty, but because we are one with it. The plot itself is weak. I don\u2019t understand what the real issue of the book is. The government doesn\u2019t look threatening. I didn\u2019t feel the pressure I felt in The Hunger Games, for example. I I don\u2019t understand what the Smokies are doing, what is their purpose, I have no empathy for them or any of the characters. Everything is very confusing. Westerfeld wants to talk about free thinking, nature, man, beauty, but he doesn\u2019t do it well. Also, I may not be an expert about economics but it seems to me that without a financial system, a country cannot work. In the Pretties society, no one pays for anything, and Tally is shocked when she learns that at the Smoke, people have to give to receive. So, yeah, it made me frown. ...more I remember my initial disappointment when Scott Westerfeld switched from adult sf to YA fiction. How could he do this to me? I liked his books, but I don't wanna read a dopey YA novel! I'd read in an interview that it was mostly a financial decision--the YA market has exploded, and that's where the money is right now. How can you fault a guy for trying to make a living? As a junior high Language Arts teacher, it's impossible not to notice that Westerfeld's first YA series has done extremely well.

As a junior high Language Arts teacher, it's impossible not to notice that Westerfeld's first YA series has done extremely well. I guess it's time I checked it out for myself. Well, after the first section of the novel, I can understand why Uglies has been a hit with the YA crowd--it's a fun, easy read. While Westerfeld hasn't completely dumbed down his writing, it is certainly much more accessible than his adult novels. Tally is a likeable teenager that the readers will identify with, and her plights are standard ones, considering the world she inhabits. Yes, it takes some suspension of disbelief to accept the premise that all people are given massive plastic surgery and made \"pretty\" at the age of 16. But if you are willing to accept the premise, the rest of the world makes sense. Tally wants to be pretty, as do all teens in this world. But she's a mischievous girl and loves to play pranks and pull tricks. When she meets up with Shay, a fellow prankster, her world is turned upside down. Shay introduces her to a world where people don't consider being pretty the ultimate goal, and when Shay runs away, choosing NOT to be made pretty, Tally is led down a road that will completely alter how she sees herself and the world around her. Westerfeld has created a good old-fashioned coming of age tale in a sf world. Sure it's a YA novel, but that's ok. We need to create another generation of sf readers. It might be a bit of an easy read for a more sophisticated (ie. old) reader like myself, but it was still enjoyable. The book is in fact the first of a trilogy, but it is possible to read the first novel by itself. Sure, the story continues, but Westerfeld does give the first book a sense of closure. I think the YA market is lucky to have Westerfeld. I hope he continues to have great success. And maybe someday, he'll write adult novels for his growing legion of YA fans. ...more Three hundred years after an apocalyptic-sized disaster that reshaped the world, Tally is about to turn 16 and pretty. In her contained, isolated, self-sufficient city - just like all the other contained, isolated, self-sufficient cities - the operation to make her pretty will be intensive, extreme and, as far as she and everyone else alive is concerned, absolutely worth it. Once she's pretty, she'll go to live across the river in New Pretty Town and party the nights away, loved by all. It's a sh Three hundred years after an apocalyptic-sized disaster that reshaped the world, Tally is about to turn 16 and pretty. In her contained, isolated, self-sufficient city - just like all the other contained, isolated, self-sufficient cities - the operation to make her pretty will be intensive, extreme and, as far as she and everyone else alive is concerned, absolutely worth it. Once she's pretty, she'll go to live across the river in New Pretty Town and party the nights away, loved by all. It's a shock to her, then, to find that her friend Shay doesn't want to be pretty, and doesn't think she's ugly now. Of course she's ugly - everyone's ugly before the operation. But Shay runs away to the mysterious, secretive Smoke where her friend <---C>David</---C> awaits, leaving Tally a set of cryptic directions in case she changes her mind and decides to go too. But Tally has no intention of running away: turning pretty is all she wants, so she can be with her friend Peris again across the river, and be noticed and listened to because beautiful people cannot be ignored. But on the day of her own operation, she is taken instead to Special Circumstances, where cruel pretties with lethal reflexes bring her to Dr. Cable. They want to know about Shay and the Smoke and where it is located, but Tally keeps her promise not to tell. Even when Dr. Cable tells her she won't get the operation and be turned pretty until she does what they ask, she does not yield. Not until Peris unexpectedly visits her in Uglyville, and reminds her of the promise she made him, that she would be with him again, a promise that predates the one she made Shay. Latching onto this ray of hope - for she doesn't want to stay ugly the rest of her life - Tally is sent to spy for Special Circumstances and give them the location of the Smoke by sending a transmission via a heart pendant given her by Dr. Cable. When she arrives, though, it's not that simple. Yes, the people are all ugly, and that takes a while to get used to. But there's something else about them, something sharp and clear at odds with the vacuousness of all the pretties she's ever known, including her own parents. And then there's David, who was born in the Smoke and is definitely not pretty ... but who teaches her that she's beautiful because of who she is, not what she looks like. I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me a lot of Isobelle Carmody's books, her heroines especially, and also Ellie from John Marsden's Tomorrow series, and a host of others. She's a quick thinker, afraid yet brave, resourceful and caring, faced with a choice no one at sixteen would want to have to make. The writing style is clear and descriptive without wasting a word, the characters deftly portrayed. While the themes and messages of the book may not be subtle - nor are they meant to be, since we're talking about the structure of their world here - there are depths to the concept, and nothing's black-and-white. There are also little digs about our own lifestyle (we are the \"Rusties\" in the book - because what's left of our cities are just rusty ruins), about how we clear-fell forests and waste resources and genetically modify plants. The entire concept could have fallen flat on its face for being too contrived and as superficial as the operation itself, but Westerfeld holds it all together with a great heroine in Tally, a dark sci-fi underworld beneath the glitter and party fun, and an examination into what price we really want to pay for the things we hold most dear. ...more Do you know that feeling, when you really want to punch a character in the face? Well, Tally Youngblood, you must be grateful that I can't see your face. Now I should stop the rant... the book itself was a quick read, but I don't get the hype. Enjoyable, yes. Good, not that much. I'm not really sure if I'll ever finish this series. Maybe one day if I'm actually bored. Seeing this book always popping up every time I searched for best YA novels, I knew I just HAD to read this. I've been actually saving this trilogy for a special reading occasion because I am really into dystopians and discovering this series was written even before the Hunger Games, I expected that I will be more than impressed. Sad to say, the book did not meet my expectation.

Sad to say, the book did not meet my expectation.

Unfortunately, the plotting of the story is too linear with the introduction taking up most of content. My, I've already read 200 pages and I still felt like I was still reading unnecessary backgrounds and introductions. The slight bumps of the story only take place when it's almost finished and I'm sure any dystopian novel written that way cannot be properly appreciated. For me, any dystopian novel should start and end with an explosion- something captivating that will hook the readers up from beginning till finale. I'm afraid that even if I want to know what happens to Tally and David in the story, I think I'm going to just have to rely on online summaries of the succeeding books because I wouldn't want to go through another agony of reading so many pages mostly wasted on unnecessary details. I\u2019ll give a merit to this book though. I think the hoverboards are cool.

This was definitely one of the better books that school has provided me with, and reading it the second time was just as great as reading it the first time. Scott Westerfeld describes everything so vividly without going overboard, and the entire theme and message of the book really connected with me, especially in the society we live in today. You must read this book! ...more I go a little crazy if I read more than one Margaret Atwood novel a year. I hope I'm not alone in this. I get the feeling that Atwood's sharp, but her writing is filed to a finer edge. I realized a while ago that one book per year was enough. I have a similar reaction to Stephen King, though I'm not sure why. I really loved The Stand , but when it was over I knew that I wasn't going to read another of his works for a while.

At first, I thought this meant that I didn't like Stephen King and Margaret Atwood. Over time, I've come to realize and accept that I really like reading them, and there's no contradiction in needing to read other authors in between. I am going through a similar process with young adult novels. I've read quite a few lately. Additionally, I feel like I shouldn't like young adult literature anyway. For one thing, I'm too old. Undeniably, I often find the characters annoying. And everything is clearly explained to the reader.* As a teacher, I have perfectly satisfactory excuses for reading young adult fiction, but I suppose I should stop kidding myself. I just like a lot of these young adult novels. Right now, young adult writers are very free to do what they want. I worry sometimes that too many authors stress over being derivative or unoriginal. Most of the best stories are stolen, and many great writers seem to excel at making people forget the source text. With young adult writers, they don't seem to be setting out to top their template stories. Instead, everything is an homage, an introduction, or a gateway for children to learn about those older templates. Since it's all for a good cause, it's not necessary to pretend like no one else wrote the story before. (Or maybe the sorts of stories that I like to read are not marketing as well with mainstream writers. I don't know.) In The Uglies , Scott Westerfield has fun introducing dystopian themes, weighing in on conformity and control. Here's the premise: In the future, everything is provided for. Life is broken up into the following stages: cute littlies, awkward uglies (teens), gorgeous pretties, authoritative middle pretties, and late pretties. Thanks to a new surgical procedure, everyone gets to give up their ugly features when they turn 16. The result is a paradise, so everyone has to become pretty. Although it means they'll always be ugly, some people choose to walk away from Omelas... Not bad, eh? Unfortunately, the breakthrough surgical procedure reminded me too strongly of Unwind and the love triangle reminded me too much of Mockingjay . Westerfield resists the urge to use a first-person voice, and that was refreshing. I've recently read quite a few dystopian young adult novels so I didn't enjoy The Uglies as much as I would have if I'd read it in 2011. It's my own fault, really. Still, I've learned something about myself, which is good. Unashamed, I think the next young adult read for me will either be The Book Thief or City of Ember . But I'm going to wait a couple months first. *Gene Wolfe is the anti-coddler, in my opinion. He doesn't write young adult fiction, but I can't think of any writers that give their readers as much credit as Wolfe does. ...more At an unspecificied time in the future everyone turning sixteen is given surgery to become \"pretty.\" Tally Youngblood is young woman, counting down the days to the procdure which despite being extremely intensive is considered worth it for a life of luxury and decadence among her peers.

She's waiting to be reunited with her best friend and enjoy the life of being pretty together. That is until she meets Shay. The two bond over having lost all their friends to the surgery and waiting to join them. They sneak out of the city to the wasteland and Tally discovers that not only does Shay not consider herself \"ugly\" but she has no intention of having the surgerys. Instead she wants to run off with a mysterious boy named David to a secret group of insurgents who refuse to have the surgery. She invites Tally to come with her, but Tally refuses. Shay runs away, leaving details on how Tally can find the group if she desires. On the day of her surgery, Tally is taken aside by Special Circumstances and told unless she finds Shay and betrays her to them, she (Tally) will be ugly for life. Tally agrees and sets out on her quest to find the rebels. If that were all the story was, it might just be merely interesting. And though the story does follow a fairly predictable character arc for Tally (she finds the group, fits in better than Shay and decides to stay), the secret behind the surgery that Scott Westerfield reveals mid-way through the novel is far more fascinating. And it also goes a long way to explaining some of the behavoir by post-surgery characters in the novel. Tally finds out that the surgery creates a specific kind of brain damage among all receipients. This twist explains why certain characters are so vapid and hedonistic in the story. Not only are the people being made to all be the same externally, they're being made to think the same way, to no longer question anything and to live only for the pleasure of the moment. The process is reversible (theoretically) and all of these various storylines lead to one massive cliffhanger that had me curious to see where things go next. ...more After finishing 425 pages that I couldn't put down, I'm finding myself needing to buy the next in the series as soon as possible.

Uglies tells the story of a post-apocalyptic dystopia where everyone gets a surgery at age 16 to make them \"pretty\" with a perfect body, perfect face, and diminished personality. This surgery is supposed to prevent people from having an unfair advantage in the workplace because of the way they look and to prevent conflicts because of the color of people's skin. And when you become a \"pretty\" there's nothing but party after party every night. However, from the age of 12-15, you have to move to Ugly Town to live with all the other \"uglies\" until your operation. However, over the years, many of the uglies have escaped beyond the city to live off the land rather than to become a pretty. The author has created a different world with different rules. The city has a grid up metal under it which magnetic hoverboards and hovercrafts use to zip around the city. People look different and have different initiation rites for growing older. One of the characters spends a great deal of time following a riddle another ugly has left behind for her to get from the city to the secret world of the uglies who refused to turn pretty. These uglies have created a place called The Smoke where they have attempted to keep vestiges of the past alive with a library of books and magazines from the time before everyone's eventual fate was to become a pretty. If the other books in this series are as good as the first, I know what I'm going to be spending too much money on in the next few days or weeks. ...more I'd heard of this book before, but I didn't realize it was futuristic.

Though I liked this book just fine, I would not say this book is amazing. It was a decent way to pass the time. My biggest criticism: I wish the main character was a bit more likable--she's a traitor, and I think we're supposed to forgive her, but I don't really want to. And I think she's supposed to be really really smart, too, but... Nah. My biggest \"wowie\" moment: The technology is pretty cool. And except for the brainwashing, I guess it might be sorta fun to live in that kind of a society--everything is recycled and solar powered, and I don't think anyone needs money to buy stuff. It's just, ask and you shall receive. The lazy man's person's ultimate fantasy. There are two more books in the series. I'll read the next two if fate dictates it, but I'm not likely to go out tomorrow and buy the box set. ...more 4,75 Wow, que mundo. Que historia.

Uglies by Scott Westerfeld is a quick and somewhat enjoyable read. I have had this one on my list to read for quite some time and really do tend to like YA dystopian fiction. This one did keep me turning the pages, but missed its mark somewhat. Despite it being engaging, it didn't contain much background information on either the event that changed the world or on the characters. Additionally, I did not care for the protagonist.

Despite it being engaging, it didn't contain much background information on either the event that changed the world or on the characters. Additionally, I did not care for the protagonist. The premise of the book is that at the age of sixteen, everyone goes through extensive surgery to become \"pretty\". So, at sixteen you become both beautiful and brainwashed. The brainwashing starts at a much younger age as most are convinced that this is a good thing and they live out much of their childhood in dormitories with children of their age, rather than living with their parents (who they visit on holidays). All of the \"uglies\" look forward to their sixteenth birthday, when they will become \"pretty\".... Tally is the protagonist, and she is counting the days! Tally's best-friend has recently become pretty and she hasn't seen him for a few months. The \"pretties\" live in a separate area where everything is handed to them and they live happily moving from party to party with the biggest challenge being how to dress for the next party. The pretties are allowed to go back to visit their \"ugly\" friends, but none ever do. Then, Tally meets Shay, a new friend, who doesn't want to become pretty. Tally and Shay have adventures sneaking out of the dorm and exploring the outside world. The have some type of hover boards, that actually sound pretty cool -- that they use to travel! There is a little-known area where people live who choose not to become pretty. (view spoiler) [ However, it is strange to me that there are truly so few people here -- mainly recent runaways with the older folks only being David's parents and the librarian. (hide spoiler) ] Shay decides to run away and not become pretty. When she is missing, Tally finds her status of turning \"pretty\" threatened. What will she do? I couldn't relate much to Tally in this book. I really wanted to shake a bit of sense into her, as well as other traits of friendship such as loyalty, honesty, commitment. On the other hand, I really liked Shay and David. I would recommend this book to true YA aficionados. At this point, not sure that I will continue with books 2 and 3 of the trilogy. ...more Real rating: 3.5 Well,this was fun.After reading a bazillion bad reviews I thought that this will be really, really bad.But it's not,it's quite amusing actually.The main character,Tally,is really cool.I liked her a lot and I completely understood all of her actions,which is a really rare thing for me.I liked the story line and the whole concept of separating ugly *cough*normal*cough* and pretty people.I also liked the new technology described and used in this book-I'd love to try those hoverboards Real rating: 3.5 Well,this was fun.After reading a bazillion bad reviews I thought that this will be really, really bad.But it's not,it's quite amusing actually.The main character,Tally,is really cool.I liked her a lot and I completely understood all of her actions,which is a really rare thing for me.I liked the story line and the whole concept of separating ugly *cough*normal*cough* and pretty people.I also liked the new technology described and used in this book-I'd love to try those hoverboards and bungee jackets!On the other hand,I didn't really liked any other character...Shy is the type of person I find annoying and inconsiderate,I just don't feel like their friendship is real.David is not bad,I have to admit that,but he's nothing special to be honest.I do hope that he will get a decent character development in the next book.Croy seems like a cool character,though.

Tally's view on us and our \"ancient magazines\" was so cool! The stuff we don't even really care that much about like magazines, the characters are thinking of them as artifacts! That's why I love dystopian books, I love seeing how civilization could turn out. This book was so creative and original, but the reason I gave it four stars and not five was because it took me soooo long to finish, it just felt like it dragged on without an end. But the ending was the perfect cliffhanger to get me to read the next one! ...more All in all, I was VERY impressed with Uglies . Westerfeld is now one of my favorite writers, not only for his immense creativity but also for his ability to blend the JUST RIGHT amount of action, description, and dialogue. This may sound like a weird comparison, but Scott Westerfeld reminds me of a gourmet chef: he knows how to measure out and mix together the right concoction of ingredients in order to make a delicious product! It made reading Uglies a fun and smooth experience. Let's face it, it All in all, I was VERY impressed with Uglies .

This may sound like a weird comparison, but Scott Westerfeld reminds me of a gourmet chef: he knows how to measure out and mix together the right concoction of ingredients in order to make a delicious product! It made reading Uglies a fun and smooth experience. Let's face it, it's really hard for authors to come up with a story that is 100% interesting and confusion-free, and it's really hard for readers (sometimes, if we're honest) to stay focused and interested the whole time. In all fairness, the middle part of story (from when Tally arrives at the Smoke to when the Smoke is ambushed) dragged just a little, but thanks to the quality of Westerfeld's writing, it never descended into tediousness. Oh, and this is a BIGGIE: there is SYMBOLISM!! Yes, Scott Westerfeld employed the literary device with such skill and thoughtfulness, I can totally see English teachers chirping with delight. I'm going to give this copy to my English-teacher mom :) Tally Youngblood is one of those characters who seems to divide readers - some of them think she's shallow and a little flat, and others really like her and can connect with her. I'm definitely in the latter category. When I read a dystopian novel, I have to keep in mind that I am reading about a society that is (probably) drastically different from my own, and it's full of people who have a different reality from me. Tally is no exception, and once I put myself in her world, it was really easy to see why she behaves the way she does and why she chooses to make certain decisions. But besides all that, Tally was just a fun character to read about. Once again, master chef Westerfeld had all the ingredients for a great character: she was assertive and witty without being bratty or snarky, she was a good friend (sometimes) who struggled with loyalty and doing the right thing, and she was self-aware without being self-absorbed. Perfecto! Oh, and I definitely need to mention Dr. Cable. Excellent, excellent villain! I *think* she's the main antagonist of the series, and wow, she was great. Yes, I have been known to really like certain villains, if they're interesting enough. I kept imagining a woman version of Agent Smith from The Matrix . My absolute favorite aspect of the story was Special Circumstances. That was *so* Matrix ! The world Westerfeld created was really interesting and I love dystopians but haven't read many, so this certainly didn't disappoint. The only groan-worthy things have to do with the dystopian elements. I don't know if this is just what all dystopians have become now, but there's an element of sameness to them that I'm picking up on. It's all about how bad we are to the environment, how materialistic we are, how dependent on oil... a little too quasi-political at times. I'll be interested to see if Suzanne Collins takes this (rather convenient) road in Hunger Games . I *do*, however, like how Westerfeld touched on some of the inherent flaws in our social culture, but the Pretty society is pretty much hedonistic like our society, just more elevated. I would have liked to feel a little more of a contrast in cultures. New Pretty Town instantly reminded me of the thirty mile zone in LA :P In a nutshell,though, Uglies was an amazing, enjoyable, and thought-provoking read that I would definitely encourage everyone to pick up. Teens will love the story, and adults will find this book immensely clever. RECOMMENDED! ...more WELL THAT WAS GREAT. WOW. WOW. 4.4 STARS. WOOOOO IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!

I got this book over a year ago, I received it for Christmas 2011, and had specifically asked for it because I had heard such great hype around it. I tried picking it up around the Christmas period and only got a few pages in and giving up because I was just not in the mood. A couple of days ago though, I have no idea why, I just felt it. Something from above said \"You feel like reading Uglies!\" And boy, was it just what I needed. Let's talk pros, and the mention the little cons. PROS: My love for this book comes from four directions. Firstly, the world. The entire concept is intricate and well played out. I can tell that Scott Westerfeld had late nights thinking up how this world would work in all it's small details. The world building is great, absolutely unlike anything I've thought of or read before. Secondly, the actual exciting plot. We have this great and fascinating world, where every new idea is really fascinating, but you also have a great story happening in the world. I was constantly excited, and a few times I found myself, either internally or vocally, saying \"NOOOO!\" because I was just so into what was going on! It's FUN to read a FUN story. Thirdly, character development. There were a few characters in this novel and they all had pretty decent development. I understood their actions and could appreciate when they thought new things and changed. Fourthly, the theme. The theme in this book is super simple: Your appearance does not define you; as an individual or a society. Even though it was so simple, so obvious, it was great. The times where I was reading and it really hit me, or when the characters were discussing it, I felt great about it. Honestly, I started feeling like a more beautiful human. That might sound cliche, but having these characters not understand that their appearance does not define them made ME appreciate it. CONS: Although I super duper enjoyed this, I had one problem. But it was kind of a big problem, and that was the writing. I really did not enjoy the writing in this. It was very distracting and very confusing. Often during exciting action scenes I didn't ACTUALLY understand what was going on because it wasn't explained clearly. I would understand \"Oh, okay, she's escaping on a hoverboard.. sort of,\" but I would get so confused by the actions of the board or the way she was moving or what was going on around her because it all felt so muddles. Also, and maybe most importantly, I don't know how he managed it, but I felt like Scott Westerfeld's writing actually ruined exciting moments. Something huge would happen, a big revelation or big plot twist, and while I'd be shocked I'd also be confused that the excitement of the story was not matching the excitement of the writing. I felt like Westerfeld either wasn't excited at all, or REALLY didn't know how to write excitement. It was actually really upsetting because some of the shocking revelations would be pushed down a bit by the unexcited delivery. It's like someone really depressingly says \"Yeah, whatever, you aced the test.\" And you're confused.. yay you did good? What? Why is this person not happy about it?! Overall though, I obviously really liked this. It was super exciting and wonderfully intricate. I ABSOLUTELY want to pick up the next book to see what happens next. I won't be doing a solitary review for this book: I'll mention it in a round up, but I will be doing a review of this series when I finish it! (Which prolly wont be for a while so don't get too excited yet!) ** Note on the cliffhanger: I might be doing a video about this, which is why I won't be going to in depth about it, but basically I hate cliff hangers. I feel that their a cheat and a trick: the author/publishing house is trying to trick me into buying the next book in a series. If you're going to write a series or trilogy, in my opinion, each book should be able to stand on it's own. Obviously you would have to read the first book before enjoying the second book, but you should be able to read the second book and be satisfied. It's really important to me to be able to say \"I feel like I finished something,\" when I finish a book. BASICALLY, before I drift too much, I felt like this was a great cliffhanger. It was exciting and crazy enough to make me want to pick up the next book, but I don't feel cheated. I feel like I did finish a story. As though if I don't pick up the rest of the series I'll still have finished something. ...more I love this series! Although a little strange, these books are original, exciting, and enjoyable. After reading Uglies, I went on to read every single book by Scott Westerfeld that I could find. Now he is one of my favorite authors, and I recommend everything that he's written. So it took me five days to read this book but it felt like I was reading it for about two weeks. It was so slow and so painful. This book is very overrated, I just don't understand how it's so popular. It never grabbed me and so I just wasn't interested. I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm feeling generous.

At first I thought it was a silly premise but as the story progressed and I found out more about the world Tally was living in, I understood why this kind of a world would seem ideal. I liked how Scott Westerfeld talked trash about us (or as he called us - \"Rusties\"). - Hoverboards. Very cool. What I did not like: - Tally. Sweet Baby Jesus, she was so irritating. I know she was 15/16 but I didn't like her. - David. Why did everyone love him? I just didn't see the appeal of his character. - The rest of the characters. They were weak characters. The words boring, clich\u00e9d and one-dimensional spring to mind. - The \"romance\". It was so weak. I didn't see any connection between Tally and David. Their insta-love and angst was annoying. - The pace. SCOTT, MY GOD MAN, PICK UP THE PACE. This book was quite possibly the slowest book I've ever read in my life. - The writing. I just didn't like it. I knew from the first chapter where Tally was explaining the vomit-coloured sky that I wouldn't like the writing and I was right. - The Special Circumstances people. They didn't seem like consistent characters. Lightening fast reflexes, superhuman senses etc and yet two teenagers outsmarted them? Not buying it. - How predictable it was. It was so predictable and the godawful slow pace just made the book so much worse. I wouldn't recommend this book. You won't miss out on anything if you skip this book. Do I want to read the sequel? No. Will I read the sequel? Probably. I wish I was someone who could have put this book down as a DNF (I really really wanted to) or someone who could skip reading the sequel because Uglies was a poor book but unfortunately I am not. Who knows, maybe the next book will be better but I'm not going to hold my breath. ...more The one where everyone has extensive plastic surgery when they turn sixteen, changing them from study-and-prank-obsessed Uglies into party-obsessed Pretties.

That's because it's the most interesting thing in the book; you're certainly not going to read this for the settings (generic) or the characters (not quirky enough to read as real individuals rather than archetypes). Even the premise is not well fleshed out, though. For instance, New Pretties are given faces and bodies that inspire desire and protectiveness (though I don't get the sense that they interact with anyone but each other, so who's protecting whom?); when the giddy party phase of young adulthood is over, there's another round of surgery transforming people into Middle Pretties, whose faces and bodies inspire people to trust them and have confidence in them. So all of people's interactions are being scripted by means of these supposedly evolutionary cues in the way other people look. You'd think this would result in people who were radically different from us, wouldn't you? But Tally seems just like an ordinary teenager who's looking forward to the greater freedom and attractiveness that high school students have. Things get more interesting in the last hundred pages, as many spoilery discoveries are made and the next two books in the series are set up, but I don't believe I'll be reading them. I expect this to be a very successful movie one day, though. It will be worth the price of admission for the hoverboards alone.

Wajah dan tubuh dalam proporsi sempurna sesuai perhitungan matematis. Kuat dan halus tanpa luka. Tidak ada perang, tidak ada perselisihan karena semua orang sama. Tidak ada penebangan hutan, tidak ada perburuan binatang, tidak ada penambangan minyak untuk bahan bakar. Yang ada hanya daur ulang, tenaga matahari, dan daging dari kedelai. Singkatnya, dunia yang melepaskan diri dari alam bebas. Alam terlalu liar, terlalu sulit dikendal Bayangkan sebuah dunia di mana semua penghuninya bersosok indah. Wajah dan tubuh dalam proporsi sempurna sesuai perhitungan matematis. Kuat dan halus tanpa luka. Tidak ada perang, tidak ada perselisihan karena semua orang sama. Tidak ada penebangan hutan, tidak ada perburuan binatang, tidak ada penambangan minyak untuk bahan bakar. Yang ada hanya daur ulang, tenaga matahari, dan daging dari kedelai. Singkatnya, dunia yang melepaskan diri dari alam bebas. Alam terlalu liar, terlalu sulit dikendalikan, terlalu berpotensi menimbulkan perang dan perpecahan. Dunia rekaan Scott Westerfeld ini langsung membetot perhatian saya sejak membuka halaman pertama. Idenya sungguh cemerlang, menyindir obsesi manusia untuk tampil sempurna. Di dunia ini, kelompok manusia terbagi menjadi dua, Kaum Rupawan dan Kaum Buruk Rupa. Tapi tidak perlu khawatir, kau hanya perlu menjadi buruk rupa hingga usiamu 16 tahun. Di hari ulang tahunmu yang keenam belas, kau akan dioperasi menjadi rupawan, pindah ke Kota Rupawan Baru, dan hidup bersenang-senang. Tak perlu bekerja keras karena semua kebutuhan sudah dipenuhi oleh penguasa. Lalu di mana masalahnya? Masalahnya, sekelompok orang merasa bahwa selama ini mereka dicuci otak oleh penguasa yang ingin menyeragamkan seisi dunia menjadi manusia-manusia sempurna berpikiran dangkal. Tally Youngblood tanpa sengaja terlibat dengan kelompok pemberontak itu, saat sahabatnya Shay melarikan diri ke markas kelompok tersebut. Tally dipaksa mencari persembunyian mereka dan melapor kepada Kaum Spesial, jika ingin dioperasi menjadi Rupawan. Kalau menolak, Tally akan dibiarkan menjadi Buruk Rupa selamanya. Tadinya saya agak kecewa kalau ternyata intinya hanya conspiracy theory (padahal hampir semua cerita seru pasti ujung-ujungnya conspiracy theory ya). Tapi seperti saya bilang tadi, yang paling menarik dari buku ini adalah dunia rekaan itu sendiri. Rasanya seperti melihat peradaban kita dari kacamata manusia masa depan yang lebih 'beradab'. Ada bagian yang cukup menggelitik saat Tally membuka majalah tua. Kira-kira seperti majalah kita sekarang, yang isinya gambar-gambar manusia dengan wajah dan tubuh beraneka rupa. Tally menganggap orang-orang dalam majalah itu sinting karena tidak malu dengan penampilan buruk rupa mereka, malah berpose dengan gembira. Shay menjelaskan bahwa mereka itu orang-orang terkenal pada jaman dahulu kala. Begini katanya: \"Pria-pria berambut jabrik ini kurasa pemusik. Yang berwajah paling jelek biasanya politisi, dan ada yang bilang, kebanyakan buruk rupa bertubuh gemuk adalah komedian.\" Hahahahaha.... Dan jangan salah, meskipun para model di majalah itu dianggap paling menyerupai kaum Rupawan, namun menurut Tally mereka seperti orang kelaparan! Westerfeld dengan gaya sarkastiknya berhasil menciptakan dunia ajaib yang menghanyutkan. Tapi jatidiri Uglies sebagai buku berseri benar-benar terasa. Membaca satu buku saja tidak akan cukup untuk memahami gambaran besar kisah ini. Setelah mengenal Kaum Buruk Rupa, buku kedua nanti menyelami Kaum Rupawan, lalu Spesial, lalu Extras. Yang Extras ini belum tercium gelagatnya di buku pertama. Kalau saya sih, rela bangeeeet deh nunggu buku keduanya ^_^ ...more Uglies (Uglies, #1), 2005, Scott Westerfeld \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0632\u0634\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628

Otherwise, Tally is a dumb bitch, David is a true fckboi and Shay is a drama queen. If it makes you feel any better, I think the world building was original but the way the story went was just too predictable. Heheee no. ...more Almost a month later... I finally finished it. About time. Like someone else reviewed, this isn't the sort of book you go to when you want to read something brilliant. It is a beach read, something light and fluffy after you've tackled War and Peace . Maybe not even then. The plot starts off extremely slow, then moves on too quickly. The romance - quick and unbelievable (reminds me slightly of Bella and Edward - there's absolutely no basis for it and they dive right in). Eventually, the plot does Almost a month later...

Like I said, it's not the world's greatest literature. But I think I will eventually read Pretties just because I'm the shallow type who has wanted Tally changed ever since page 1 ^^ ...more Tally and Peris have been best friends since before Tally can remember. Now that Peris is sixteen, Tally won\u2019t see him again for another couple of months. In Tally\u2019s world when you turn sixteen you get to be made pretty. Tally lives in Uglyville and everyone that lives there is ugly. It isn\u2019t until your sixteen birthday that you undergo the operation that will turn you into a Pretty. Tally can\u2019t wait to be turned pretty for her thin lips to be lusciously full and her eyes to be beautifully spaced Tally and Peris have been best friends since before Tally can remember.

Tally can\u2019t wait to be turned pretty for her thin lips to be lusciously full and her eyes to be beautifully spaced. Everyone gets to be pretty that way everyone has an equal chance. Just before she is to have her operation Tally meets Shay who happens to share a birthday with Tally. But Shay isn\u2019t like Tally. She doesn\u2019t think that being ugly is all that bad. Ultimately Shay decides to run away from Uglyville before her operation and join a possibly mythical city where everyone is ugly. But Shay can\u2019t convince Tally to join her, but finds away to show Tally the way if she would ever change her mind. When Tally leaves for her operation something goes terribly wrong. They know that Shay has run away to the city of uglies called the Smoke. And they won\u2019t make Tally pretty unless she finds Shay and eventually lead them to the Smoke. But once Tally finds the Smoke and lives amongst its people, will she want to betray them? Then she unexpectedly finds out a secret that they are keeping from the Pretties. Scott Westerfeld\u2019s first installment of the Uglies trilogy proves to be a captivating experience that will leave you wanting more even after you read the last page. I\u2019ve read other books by Westerfeld and I have to say this is defiantly my favorite. It is a futuristic sci-fi, but could totally be nonfiction in the distant future! The book was clearly thought provoking, yet entertaining. I will be reading Pretties very soon! ...more", "Title": "Uglies"},
