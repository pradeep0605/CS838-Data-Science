There is t Sitting down to write a review of this book, I don't quite know where to start. I was going to quote a passage that I particularly loved. But no good can come of that. Once I opened that door, where would I stop quoting? So let me say this. I genuinely loved this book. I look forward to reading it again. I will buy copies for my family as gifts. I will listen to the audio and lament my own lack of narrative skill. I will gush about it to strangers. In short, it is a Neil Gaiman novel. There is truth here,<---M> and beauty</---M>, and joy, and a sad, sweet melancholy that moves through my chest like distant thunder. I realize that what I am writing here is not really a review in any conventional sense. It is a paen. A panegyric. It is the textual equivalent of a huge, happy, gormless grin. And you know what? I'm fine with that. Let the professionals write their reviews. Let them get all jargony about it. Let them try to pin this book to the page, not realizing that a pinned butterfly holds no delight. A pinned butterfly is nothing like a butterfly at all. I make no claims to impartiality in regard to Gaiman's work. Sandman changed how I thought about stories. Neverwhere was a talisman for me. Stardust is a golden bell hung in my heart. And American Gods taught me that there was a *name* for the sort of book I was struggling to write. It was a picaresque. So if you're looking for impartiality, this is not the review for you. Look elsewhere. Me? I will enjoy <+++>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</+++> without dissection. It made me happy. It made me feel less alone. It made me love Neil Gaiman a little more than I already did, and that's something I didn't think was possible. Do I hope to someday write a book like this? No. I never could. He's done something odd and strange and lovely here. I couldn't hope to replicate it. Instead, this is what I hope. In the future, when Joss Whedon and I are best friends and hanging out together in my tree fort, I hope Neil Gaiman comes over too. Because then the three of us will all play Settlers of Catan together. And I will win, because I'm really great at Settlers of Catan. But I will also be very gracious about it, and apologize for putting the bandit on Gaiman's wheat twice in a row. Then we will make smores, and I will toast a marshmallow with such deftness and perfection that they will be amazed and realize I am kinda cool. Then we will talk about Battlestar Galactica, and which Doctor is our favorite, and we will tell ghost stories late into the night. God I'm tired. I should really go to sleep. I have no idea what I'm saying anymore. I hope I don't regret this in the morning. ...more Lettie shrugged. \u201cNobody actually looks like what they really are on the inside. You don\u2019t.

There's friendship and love, and cruelty and resentment. And there are monsters - and, in the true fashion of the tradition I love, the real monsters come from the people's wishes, the people's own selves, the deep down dark that lives inside us. \u201cMonsters come in all shapes and sizes, Some of them are things people are scared of. Some of them are things that look like things people used to be scared of a long time ago. Sometimes monsters are things people should be scared of, but they aren't.\u201d Maybe once upon a time you were seven, and bookish, and lonely, and sometimes a stranger to your own parents. Maybe your first experience with deaths brought into your world a strange family of three living just down the lane in a little farmhouse - the Maiden, the Mother and the Crone of the fairytales. Maybe your first ever friend, eleven-year-old (<---B>or maybe infinities-old, who knows?</---B>) <---C>Lettie Hempstock</---C>, the girl for whom in your seven-year-old's sense of own immortality you nevertheless are 'perfectly willing to die' because - of course! - she is your friend, will take you on an unexpectedly sinister journey culminating somewhere and somewhen under the haunting orange sky. And maybe after that nothing will ever be the same. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something important. Grown-ups don\u2019t look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they\u2019re big and thoughtless and they always know what they\u2019re doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren\u2019t any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.\u201d And maybe something from underneath that sinister sky will choose you as a way to break through reality into your little secure world of a child. And maybe because of that you will come to a terrifying realization that the world is not safe, that adults may not be there to protect you, that world has teeth and is ready to bite you with them any time it wants to. And you realize that nothing is as it seems - and that there's no reason why the pond cannot be Lettie Hempstock's ocean, after all. \"I saw the world I had walked since my birth and I understood how fragile it was, that the reality I knew was a thin layer of icing on a great dark birthday cake writhing with grubs and nightmares and hunger. I saw the world from above and below. I saw that there were patterns and gates and paths beyond the real. I saw all these things and understood them and they filled me, just as the waters of the ocean filled me. Everything whispered inside me. Everything spoke to everything, and I knew it all.\" There are certain authors that in my mind have become a genre of their own. Neil Gaiman is one of them. When I read his books, I don't read fantasy, or urban fantasy, or any other such label. What I read is \"a Gaiman\" , a unique blend of humor and dry wit and a strong narrative voice making the strangest leaps of imagination seem like nothing out of ordinary. And every time when I put down the book of his I've been reading into the wee hours of the night, unable to stop, I find myself with a haunting sense of longing and missing the world he created, the world into which he so effortlessly immerses his readers, the world of his storytelling that you never want to leave. It's like Lettie Hempstock's ocean, the waters of which you wish you never had to leave, but where you cannot stay forever, no matter how badly you would want to. \"I found myself thinking of an ocean running beneath the whole universe, like the dark seawater that laps beneath the wooden boards of an old pier: an ocean that stretches from forever to forever and is still small enough to fit inside a bucket, if you have Old Mrs. Hempstock to help you get it in there, and you ask nicely.\" Neil Gaiman again is at his best, which for him is, I guess, just ordinary. This book will join my personal favorites by him - especially 'The Graveyard Book' to which it's a soul cousin. And I will revisit it in the future, probably more than once, just to hang out with Lettie and Old Mrs. Hempstock, and maybe to catch the hint of a wave on an ancient world-ocean in the back yard. 4.5 stars. \u201cAnd did I pass?\" The face of the old woman on my right was unreadable in the gathering dusk.

This book is childhood. Are all Neil Gaiman books like this? So beautifully, hauntingly nostalgic? I confess, this is my first; but right now I am logging into amazon to make sure it isn't my last. I have one criticism, which is that this book isn't really an adult book. The few adult scenes felt added as an afterthought to try and convince us little people that this is actually a very grown-up kinda story. But, take out that dodgy sex scene, and I would have been mesmerised and terrified by this book as a kid, perhaps even more than I was reading it today. It has everything that we could possibly ask for in childhood: magic, adventure, overcoming fears, those things that children know and adults no longer understand or remember, and it's all wrapped up in a tidy 180 pages. There's an almost dreamlike quality to the story and there are many reasons it's hard to know what's real and what is not. The book opens with a middle-aged man revisiting the place where he used to live with his parents and sister when he was a young boy of seven. He visits his old house before wandering down to the farm at the end of the lane, a place that starts to bring back a strange sequence of memories as seen through the eyes of a young boy. How real are the magic and monsters of our childhood? When we look back and see ignorant youths believing in the impossible, are we enlightened adults? Or are we the ignorant ones, blinded by years dedicated to being sensible and not believing? Are the villains we remember monsters from another world? Or is that just how children make sense of the people who brought upheaval into their lives? I found it truly fascinating. The creepy yet beautiful setting in the English countryside was fantastic. A little lonely, somewhat isolated... like a world entirely of its own in which anything could be possible. This book held all the charm and beauty of the world portrayed in Cider With Rosie , but was ten times more compelling and addictive. And there were the characters, of course. Lettie Hempstock, an eleven year old who might just have been eleven for a very long time, and her quirky mother and grandmother. Also, the narrator had my sympathy throughout; his seven year old lack of understanding and fear of the adult world that he saw as separate from his own was easily believable, for me. I think we do create a world of our own when we're kids, one that adults aren't a part of, that's how we're able to believe in things like magic and wizards and Santa. To put it plainly, I really enjoyed my first trip into the world of Gaiman. The ending is perfect. A little sad. But mostly perfect.

There is a reason this book is labelled as \"adult\" and it has nothing to do with sexual content or violence or gore. To be an adult by age is meaningless because, to truly appreciate this book, you must be an adult by experience. You must be adult enough to miss childhood . Me, I'm not there yet. I don't miss being a child because I remember being a child. I can still see it when I turn back. So right now, no. This is not my favorite Gaiman book. But in 20-odd years, it probably will be. Because The Ocean at the End of the Lane is one of those books.

I loved Sta In the acknowledgments section of his latest novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane , Neil Gaiman admits that the project was initially meant to be a short story, which grew to be a novel - not a very long novel, but a novel nonetheless. For fans it was big news, as it would be his first novel for adults since 2005's Anansi Boys . I was never really into Gaiman's work - I wasn't crazy about American Gods or Neverwhere and Coraline , all of which are routinely mentioned as fan favorites. I loved Stardust , though - his short fantasy which I thought was beautiful and had to read in one sitting. The Ocean sounded like a a welcome return to the familiar field, and I was compelled to give it a try. Gaiman's narrator is an unnamed English man in his forties, who returns to his childhood home located in the English countryside of Sussex. There he is drawn to familiar places which he has not seen for ages, and which evoke memories long buried. He ends up by the house of his childhood friend, Lettie Hempstock, and remembers when he was seven years old and how Lettie used to call the pond beside her house an ocean. Ultimately, this is a lazy book - for several reasons. The first one is an enormously flat and dull narrative voice. The narrator is obviously remembering his youth from an adult perspective, but the end effect is reduced to sentences in vein of \"I did this and that\" \"And then this happened\". There's absolutely no childish joy or fear, or even the adult's surprise at a sudden recollection of a forgotten memory of youth. The language is lackluster, flavorless and as flat as the steppes of Kazakhstan, to the point of becoming downright dull and distracting because of its dullness. How are the readers supposed to give a damn if we can barely muster the strength to turn the page? Perhaps it's my own recent personal experience of spending a week in an English village while visiting my friends, but I thought that the setting of this book was another lost opportunity. The countryside is beautiful, but all the the reader will get from it in this book is the fact that people live on farms and sometimes have small ponds near their houses. There's no sense of place specific to Sussex or England in this book at all; it could as well have taken place in the suburbs of Chicago. Not that long ago I read and reviewed The Land of Laughs , the debut novel of Jonathan Carroll, a fan favorite considered to be classic of fantasy - which I found to b a bland play on fantasy tropes without much originality, I have the same complaints about The Ocean - which really is nothing more than an overly stretched short story, employing all the well known staples of the genre and made up to resemble a short novel. The protagonist is an obvious stand-in for the author, but besides waxing nostalgia and melancholy the novel doesn't seem to have any real goal or accomplish anything in particular. It reads almost like Neil Gaiman's rushed assignment for a creative writing class he took ages ago - full of pretension of powerful statements about human beings, deep as the ocean, but in reality being little else than the well-known drizzle deep no more than an ordinary puddle, which evaporates after a few days and leaves absolutely no mark. ...more It's kinda ridiculous how much I want to read this book.

It feels a lot more like a young adult novel, more akin to the Graveyard Book or Coraline than American Gods. Secondly, it's only 175 pages long. In and of itself, that's fine, but with a whopping 25.99 price tag, it's kind of a gouge. Gripes aside, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a pretty cool book. Gaiman does a masterful job at portraying the nameless lead character, a seven year old boy who befriends at odd eleven-year old girl named Lettie, who may or may not be as old as the universe, and her mother and grand mother. Maiden, mother, and crone remember the Old Country, which sank, or the really Old Country, which blew up. The Ocean at the End of the Lane, like a lot of Neil Gaimain work, deals with dreams, the effect of belief on reality, and forgotten things, like things that every kid knows and every adult has forgotten. There's not a lot I can say without giving away the best bits. Gaiman has a way of making his young adult books way scarier than his adult ones and this one falls into that category. Urusula and the hunger birds were both pretty creepy, as was what happened with the boy's foot. That's about all I can say. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a really quick read but full of interesting ideas and great moments. Four out of five. I may elevate it to a five on a reread. ...more Can a pond being an ocean?

A THICK BOOK ISN'T GUARANTEE OF ANYTHING GOOD A story only matters, I suspect, to the extent that the people in the story change. Neil Gaiman can accomplish so much more in just 181 pages than other authors in 700 plus pages. A big book isn't a guarantee of being any good. A short book can be as much fantastic, if not more. Even it's more respectful being able to create a so rich story in so few pages than having 700 plus pages and not resolving anything. Sometimes people can think that only thick books deserve respect and don't get me wrong, there are many thick books indeed worthy of respect, but the quantity of written pages isn't a certification that any book is indeed really good. And certainly there are also bad small books too. But I can tell you that... ...this is a small book AND it's reallly good! LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING Nobody actually looks like what they really are on the inside. This is a story where I can assure you that I was so scared at some moments than in other books clearly labeled as horror, and I was so astounded with the magic here than in other books clearly labeled as fantasy. Even if you know some of Neil Gaiman's influences when he was a kid, you will be glad to see them here in a way or other. Even if you read really carefully you will get to know about where certain other writers got some ideas for their own insanely famous books, letting clear that sometimes author's originality is just a matter of reader's ignorance.

It earned her the nickname Cannonball. She was notorious, not only for her distinctive dimensions, but for having a particularly foul temper. Her starched garb also pinched her face into a state of permanent floridity and pursed her lips into a particularly fish-like shape. It was not a happy year for me at school. There would be more than one instance of raised voices, and more than one rap across the hands with yardsticks. I was even banned from the classroom for a spell, to wander the halls for hours, unaccompanied. But I somehow knew that eventually I would be a third grader no longer and would escape the sharpened claws and flapping habit of this creature. She was unpleasant, for sure, but she did not present an existential threat. Neil on a drainpipe as a lad \u2013 from his FB page When the unnamed narrator of Neil Gaiman\u2019s book, The Ocean at the End of the Lane , turns 7, he has troubles of his own. It begins with zero attendance at his birthday party. The family comes on some hard times and must take in boarders. The boy is given a kitten, Fluffy, to ease the loss of his room, but the pet falls victim to a cab, arriving with a South African opal miner, the latest paying resident. Not long after, the miner takes the family car. It is found soon after, at the end of a nearby lane, with a body in the back seat, and a hose running from the tail pipe to the driver\u2019s window. At the scene, the boy meets an eleven-year-old girl, Lettie Hempstock, who takes charge of him, and brings him to her family\u2019s farm, which borders the lane. And so begins a beautiful friendship. (Members of the extended Hempstock family, btw, turn up in several other Gaiman books) Lettie lives with her mother and grandmother. When strange events begin to erupt in the area--the boy\u2019s sister is assaulted by flung coins, the boy wakes up choking on a coin, and other strangeness afflicts neighbors--Lettie seems to know what is causing them. She is sent to take care of it and brings the boy, her little friend, along. They travel across the Hempstock property and into what seems another world, (mentions of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland, among others, let us know that lines will be crossed) a place that has some threatening inhabitants. Lettie confronts the troublemaker, but the boy reacts to an event instead of thinking and disobeys her lone order, to keep hold of her hand. That is when the real trouble begins. Image taken from abc.net.au The boy is far too young for this to be a coming of age tale, but a central element of horror, whether of the Freddie Krueger, Nurse Ratched (or Sister Evangelista) variety, or the flapping beast central to Gaiman\u2019s tale, is one\u2019s helplessness before a greater, and ill-intentioned power. Although he doesn\u2019t characterize his intentions as horror-mongering, Gaiman has laid out what he was up to in writing the book. It was meant to be just about looking out at the world through the kind of eyes that I had when I was 7, from the kind of landscape that I lived in when I was 7. And then it just didn't quite stop. I kept writing it, and it wasn't until I got to the end that I realized I'd actually written a novel. ... I thought \u2014 it's really not a kids' story \u2014 and one of the biggest reasons it's not a kids' story is, I feel that good kids' stories are all about hope. In the case of Ocean at the End of the Lane, it's a book about helplessness. It's a book about family, it's a book about being 7 in a world of people who are bigger than you, and more dangerous, and stepping into territory that you don't entirely understand. Gaiman was aware that his work might appeal to young readers for whom is it not intended. He said that he deliberately made the first few chapters of the book dull as a way to dissuade younger readers, who would be put off by that and disinclined to continue on to the juicy bits. The world the young boy faces may not be understandable. There is just too much to take in and Gaiman captures that element of childhood quite well. Changes for the boy at home include the antithesis of Mary Poppins, in the form of one Ursula Monkton, who seems to have arrived on an ill wind, with the added bonus of her having designs on the boy\u2019s father. Adults overall seem pretty careless. But there is some balance in this universe. Lettie\u2019s family seems beyond time itself, a bright light in the darkness, welcoming, comforting, nurturing. And then there\u2019s the ocean. Looks like a pond to you or me, but it has qualities quite unlike other bodies of water. As in his earlier American Gods , there are things that have been brought to this newer world from the place its residents once occupied. You may not be able to go home again, but what if you could take it with you? (Also a theme in American Gods ) Gaiman says he usually writes for himself. One thing that was different about this book was that he was writing for someone else. His wife, musician Amanda Palmer, was off in Australia making an album. Where you or I might send along daily, or weekly notes of what was going on, Gaiman sent something else I will tell my wife, by making stuff up, kind of what it was like to be me when I was seven, from the inside of my head, not in the real world, then put it in the actual landscape that I grew up in. There really had been a boarder who killed himself in the family ride. Like his young hero, Gaiman climbed drainpipes. There really was a farm down the lane that had been recorded in the DomesDay Book. And as with such enterprises he did not have a large framework constructed. It was \"like driving at night through the fog\" \u2013 he knew \"three or five pages ahead what would happen\", but no further. There is some material here that rankled a bit. The substitute parent trope had been used to good effect in Coraline and manifests in many of the Disney animated classics, evil stepmothers in Cinderella, Snow White and the like. Ditto here. Maybe going to that well one time too many? And is dad really that dim? But there is also a nice diversity of conceptual toys at work. The flapping baddie was fun. The magical ocean and ageless Hemplocks are also very engaging. The nothingness created by the creatures referred to, among other things, as hunger birds , reminded me of Stephen King\u2019s Langoliers, also the Nothing of the Never-Ending Story and the Dark Thing of a Wrinkle in Time. Might the three Hemplocks serve as a sort of feminine Holy Trinity? There is a wormhole that involves an actual\u2026you know\u2026worm, which made me smile for a long time. And any time there is a dip into water, one must ponder things baptismal, rebirth, either literal or spiritual. Letting go is what so much of growing up is about. It is the very thing that must be done in order to be able to grow, to live one\u2019s own life. But sometimes letting go has the opposite effect, and can place you in peril, particularly when you are only 7 and not ready for the consequences. There is a lot in this short book on holding on, and letting go, and the price of both. There is a lot on doing what is right, on personal sacrifice, on permanence and the ephemeral, on remembering and forgetting. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a short novel. But do not let go of the notion that this is a book for adults. The ocean in question may look to be a pond, but do not be deceived. Jump in. The water\u2019s fine, and deep.

Now, it's not clear from the story how much is pure fantasy and how much is reality that's been warped into fantasy by the passage of time, but it's my interpretation that the events are at least based on reality, i.e. what the boy remembers actually happened while the reasons for it happening may be made up. If that's the case, I really don't feel anything 'magical' or 'nostalgic' comes out of what is essentially a story of unresolved abuse, as I never felt the boy comes to terms with his father's role in what happened. The Hempstocks' sure, but not his father's. That lack of closure (and me not really getting the nostalgia) are the reasons for my lower rating. Of course, the other explanation is that everything that happened is pure fantasy, i.e. the monster manipulated his father into drowning him and it wasn't 'real' but a fictional account, but this explanation for me is even less satisfying because as I alluded to originally the story just becomes your garden variety attack of the evil babysitter and ruins the profoundness of the rest of the book. I guess I could have gone with it as many people have, but as I said I don't feel the general sense of nostalgia towards childhood as many older readers have, and frankly I don't understand why anyone would find nostalgia when such abuse is being glossed over. (hide spoiler) ] Original Review One day perhaps, when I am forty seven years old looking back at my seven year old self, The Ocean at the End of the Lane will hold more appeal for me, but I am not forty seven years old yet. Neil Gaiman's latest book is a beautifully written, haunting paean to lost childhood, but the story itself was just an incredibly trying experience. Gaiman has a lot to say about the innocence and powerlessness of being seven years old, but frankly, I'm still at an age when I refuse to believe I was either of those things when I was seven years old, so while I applaud Gaiman's genius storytelling, I just can't ignore my frustration with the actual story. What worked for me about The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the presence of Gaiman's trademark qualities that's been praised time and time again. This is the very personal story of a middle aged man, somewhat lost over the years, returning to his childhood home to find himself again and reminisce about the strange events once encountered by his seven year old self, but more than that, Gaiman infuses the story with his surrealist magic that makes every word almost hauntingly beautiful. (Plus some really creepy and fantastic imagery, like with that worm...) Sure, Gaiman never comes out and directly tells us what happened to his narrator (although much can be inferred) or what's real and what isn't, but that's the beauty of the story, the mystery not only emphasizes how memories, especially childhood memories, are not concrete, tangible things but bygone magic, but really also compounds the wistful and somber tone of the story. Purely as a work of writing, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is top notch and modern myth at its best. What I can't overlook though, is that Gaiman writes the book from the point of view of a middle aged man looking at his childhood through the eyes of his seven year old self, and it just didn\u2019t work for me. As I said, I still remember my childhood quite well, and I wouldn't exactly describe it as anything magical or special, so while I had a vague sense of the emotions Gaiman wanted to convey with his magical words, I don't think I'm at an age when I can fully appreciate the deeper emotions that I'm told are here - everything I felt only worked on an academic level. Rather than being moved by the sadness, the nostalgia, the melancholia, I actually became more and more embittered and jaded as the story progressed, because, although I get Gaiman\u2019s narrator is reflecting back on a neglected childhood and parents who didn\u2019t really understand him, a monster destroys this kid's family, his father abuses him, and I'm sorry, but how Gaiman handled that at least completely irked me. I know I praised Gaiman for blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, but that for me is also this book's downfall, because either way, whether I accept the events of the book as fact or fantasy, there's just something substantively lacking about Gaiman's narrative. Maybe because he's too focused on the surrealist aspects, maybe because I'm just still too young and can't understand the kind of parent/child interactions Gaiman alludes to, but I hated Gaiman's interpretation of this family. If I took the events as fact veiled by fiction, I think Gaiman tries too hard to appeal to that adult sense of childhood as a sad, innocent time, and just oversimplifies the narrator\u2019s relationship with his father, eventually sweeping the bulk of what happens under a rug, because at the end of the day, has what the monster caused affected anyone in any meaningful way? Not as far as I can tell. And if it's taken as pure fiction? - then the plot is hardly profound at all, but merely your garden variety attack of the evil babysitter. Twenty odd years from now, when I look back at this review, I suspect I'll probably disagree with much, probably even all, of my criticisms. But for the time being, while childhood doesn't have the emotional appeal for me that Gaiman's capturing, The Ocean at the End of the Lane tries too hard to recapture the nostalgia at the expense of exploring the trauma to the point in parts it almost reads like formulaic horror, while the elements that probably hold the most magic are the ones that I'm probably just too young to appreciate. ...more Everything you need to know about \"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\" is right there in the title.

This is basically a dark and beautiful fairytale that feels quite real and was a bit disturbing at times. I hope that I am making sense. I've never done a review for a book so hard to review! This isn't my normal genre. In fact the only reason I listened to the audio version of this book is because I purchased it on special from Audible a few months ago. I can't believe it took me this long to get to it. I just didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong! Completely wrong! The lesson I learned from this book is that it's very important to step out of my comfort zone and that I need to listen to more books by Mr. Gaiman! The one thing I will say is that I don't usually listen to audiobooks read by the author. They tend to be monotone. Not this author! Boy can he tell a story! He's just under Colin Firth as a narrator! That says a lot because Mr. Firth rocked my world with his narration of \"The End of the Affair\"!!!

As an incorrigible nostalgic it\u2019s not easy to explain what draws me to my frequent ruminations on the years when I was young, protected and innocent, what compels me to relive those moments. I do uphold that I don\u2019t consider my nostalgic bouts as a way to forsake the future, nor a means to escape the present. My parents and their accomplices have gifted me with the most precious of things they could offer: a happy childhood, that serves as a source of joy, a well of inspiration, a blanket of comfort, now and tomorrow. It doesn\u2019t hold me back as much as it keeps me going. When I think of my childhood, a warm glow pervades the sceneries in my head. It\u2019s a glow both dreamy and real, both soft and intense. Neil Gaiman has captured this glow in \u201c The Ocean at the End of the Lane \u201d.

Someone who knows that he knows things that his parents don't know he knows. The fears are as vivid as it can be our owns. Mr. Gaiman captures the feeble nature of childhood perfectly in this work. He confessed that he actually meant it to be a short story that got out of control. Interestingly so, the author attributes the motivation for writing this masterpiece to deal with a 4 month separation from his wife. The result was a thoroughly engaging and majestically laced novel. An ocean of feelings. Told you, this is the hardest book to be reviewed I have read this year. So, I will let that be the end.

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy. Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie\u2014magical, comforting, wise beyond her years\u2014promised to protect him, no matter what. A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark. My Review : A charming way to wile away a Saturday afternoon. It's a lovely story. Been told before, as what has not, but to call tis little entertainment a groundbreaking work by a master is absurd. Did I enjoy it? Oh yes. I liked it fine. As always in a Gaiman book, no one changes. Nameless narrator as child confronts horrible reality that all is not as it seems, he is not Safe, and the world can be whisked away in a flood of knowledge. He goes on being a child. Nameless adult narrator comes to terms with loss, only he doesn't really because he can't remember what it is he's coming to terms with. The Norns, Ur\u00f0r, Skuld, and Ver\u00f0andi, are brilliant constructs, even if there is doubt about their separate and uninfluenced creation in Norse mythology and not grafts of the Greek Fates. The Norns, and their amazing well, describe all too clearly the experience of being alive in the elegant universe that quantum physics tells us lies under the pretty picture we lie ourselves to sleep with. Gaiman clearly Gets It. He expresses his clear-eyed and seemingly unflinching comprehension and acceptance of the unreality of the illusion we inhabit in this book. That's refreshing and it's pleasant. But brilliant? Groundbreaking? Really now. James Joyce was brilliant. Proust was brilliant. Beckett's plays are brilliant. I will perform the osculum infame on Fox News if someone can make a respectable case for Gaiman being brilliant by those lights. A worthy and amusing entertainment. There is nothing whatever wrong with that.

The second word that popped up was Holden Caulfield (from The Catcher in the Rye), because the boy reminded me of him. I remember enjoying reading The Catcher in the Rye, but this one was not that great and I've mixed feelings towards this book. Gaiman is a good writer but certainly not a great one, for me. His prose was eloquent and I admired his writing skills but it was his imagination that really annoyed me. He created everything, out of nowhere, as if his sole purpose is to defy physics, logic, all of the sciences, and above all the common sense; in the name of fantasy. In my opinion, he utterly failed in this endeavor. Being a man of reason I loathed this utterly illogical depictions of things in the story and I'd to force myself to finish it. However, there is a flip side too. His depiction of the tale is admirable and he was able to evoke many emotions simultaneously - fear, sadness, anger, disgust, anticipation, surprise, and joy. His tale has an emotional depth to it, and evokes nostalgia. It's a trip down the memory lane. I liked the climax, the way he ended the story. It cheered me up a little, and that's why I've given it two and half which is rounded to two stars. But I'm still not sure if I liked this story by Gaiman. 2.5/5.0 ...more Although completely different from its predecessor, The Ocean at The End of the Lane is Gaiman's best work since American Gods .

Deeply personal but not quite autobiographical, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is dense and profoundly moving. The novel's plot (I kind of hate that word) lands in standard Gaiman territory. A seven year old boy, quiet and bookish, encounters a body (I'm not giving too much away, don't worry) and, from there, interacts with a universe-behind-the-world populated by heroes and monsters. Gaiman patiently lingers, first person-style, decades later in the narrator's mind as he pieces memories together. The narrator visits a country farmhouse on impulse and instinct. Later he says, in reference to home, \"I don't know where that is, anymore\" and an old woman replies \"You always say that.\" The ocean, so to speak, becomes rebirth, transition, and essence too deep to articulate. The narrator experiences hurt, love, sadness and mystery as both more and less powerful in his recognition of their depth and nature. A scant 160 pages, the novel moves at a meditative pace; one action scene requires the narrator to wait . Gaiman's sparse strategy serves him well. Some books work better with fewer, rather than more, words. I get the feeling that The Ocean at the End of the Lane was a difficult project. Listen. Gaiman could have written American Gods 2 and sold a zillion copies and continued with his tepid Facebook posts. He's got it made. But with The Ocean at The End of the Lane he pushed himself to a deep, elemental place. I admire that. It's not the easy way out, I imagine, but rather than repeating his successes Gaiman explores what probably set him reading and writing in the first place. Well done, sir. You did not let me down, and I admit, I kind of expected you to let me down. Thanks for proving me wrong. ...more 3 \"think I get it...but needed more\" stars.

How can you not sense the profoundness of what Gaiman is saying? But not anymore - because now I understand that it is a fundamental difference of perception: one you can't explain or substantiate, like the taste of a particular curry one loves and another hates. The unnamed narrator of this novel says: ...the patterns in the headboard of the bed at my grandmother's house, which, if I looked at them wrongly in the moonlight, showed me an old man with his mouth open wide, as if he were screaming. I know what he means, oh yes: I similarly saw the face of an old hag in a dead leaf when I was two or three (reading this passage jogged my memory, and I suddenly recalled this long-forgotten terrifying incident), and had a very difficult time explaining it to my parents (they still don't know). It is a fact that only some can see. ------------------------------- The country of childhood is a strange and exhilarating and (yes!) frightening place. Adults follow paths. Children explore. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurs to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath the rhododendrons, to find the spaces between the fences. It is on this path, off the beaten track, that Gaiman takes you in this novel (as in many others), as you accompany the seven-year-old protagonist on a frightening and exhilarating journey to the end of the lane, where three generations of female Hempstocks (who are perhaps older than time itself) live in their farmhouse - a farmhouse which also houses a duck-pond which is really an ocean. You watch with bated breath as he battles an evil out of time which appears in the guise of an ordinary governess, and pray for him as the hunger birds descend upon him ravenously. Of course, you do this if you can enjoy the story for what it is, without trying to find the meanings hidden between the words. I liked myths. They weren't adult stories and they weren't children's stories. They were better than that. The just were . YES. ------------------------------- As a shy and socially backward youngster, I found refuge in books at a very early age. As I grew up, the stories changed, but a bit of the boy who lost himself between the pages of a novel stayed. I thought about adults. I wondered if that was true: if they were all really children wrapped in adult bodies, like children's books hidden in the middle of dull, long books. The kind with no pictures or conversations. I do not know about all adults, but I definitely fit the bill. If you think you do too, please take some time to visit the ocean at the end of the lane. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. ...more It would be unfair to call this a review. This is not a review. This is a response, a reaction. I have just finished reading The Ocean At The End Of The Lane. I bought it about two hours ago; I started and finished it in around an hour and a half. My chest hurts. Really, everything hurts, but that is, as always, the epicentre of the swelling bruise I became when reading this book. I can\u2019t say whether that was the intention. I doubt Neil Gaiman wakes up each morning and thinks to himself, \u2018Now how It would be unfair to call this a review. This is not a review. This is a response, a reaction. I have just finished reading The Ocean At The End Of The Lane. I bought it about two hours ago; I started and finished it in around an hour and a half. My chest hurts. Really, everything hurts, but that is, as always, the epicentre of the swelling bruise I became when reading this book. I can\u2019t say whether that was the intention. I doubt Neil Gaiman wakes up each morning and thinks to himself, \u2018Now how can I hurt people today?\u2019 He could but I doubt it. It\u2019s a space already occupied by Joss Whedon, after all. Nonetheless, when you come across something that has bits \u2013 no, whole chunks \u2013 of you smeared into it, daubed across a white canvas, or stuffed in the white space between lines on a page, when you come across those parts of yourself, it hurts. It hurts for any number of reasons. Sometimes, it\u2019s because you forgot those particular parts, that red chunk of meat that contains a smell, the pungent odour of a certain dish, or your grandmother\u2019s smile, or that time you found things you shouldn\u2019t have. Sometimes it hurts just because you know someone else has experienced the same thing, is experiencing the same thing. Sometimes it\u2019s most painful when you realise other people know you\u2019re hurting. I found more than that in this book, saw the flickering reel of my dusty memories \u2013 goddamn it, I\u2019m only 23, why are they so dusty, so hard to hold onto? - playing out beneath this sparkling fable. It\u2019s to be expected I suppose. These past 6 weeks, in the midst of completing my Masters in Creative Writing, I lost myself in poetry. I found Spoken Word, and the power of speaking, not just writing, opened up forgotten landscapes of my childhood. I wrote some 5000 words of poetry in just over a month. Lines about my grandmother being a mountain, about abuse and neglect, about stars and oceans and stories and words and the power of all these things in shaping me. Like I said, I lost myself, poured it all out onto the page in a way I\u2019d never done before and it feels like I\u2019ve just blinked and woken up from a particularly deep sleep, the kind that leaves you feeling heavy for days, that fills up all the cracks \u2013 I\u2019ve woken up and found this book in my hands, and it was absolutely the right book to be there, because it did all the things I\u2019ve been doing these past few weeks, only in a much more magical, much more beautiful way, disguised as a really lovely story. This is a story about a boy who gets lost and never really finds his way home, a boy so lost, he sometimes forgets he\u2019s even lost to begin with and that, right there, just about sums up my life. Which, yes, is kind of heartbreaking, but really, there\u2019s plenty of wonder to be discovered along the way. The problem is simply holding on to that wonder, a problem eased if you read or write or create art in any sense. There is a passage in this book that perfectly articulates the awful truth of needing to tell stories: \u201cHow can you be happy in this world? You have a hole in your heart. You have a gateway to lands beyond the world you know. They will call you, as you grow. There can never be a time when you forget them, when you are not, in your heart, questing after something you cannot have, something you cannot even properly imagine\u2026\u201d This is a thing that has underpinned everything I do. A very real hole, and a very real fear. Reading an amazing story fills that hole for a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s liking taking the fullest breath you can, holding it all deep in your chest, as wide and expanded as you possible can be \u2013 then watching it gurgle away, letting that breath explode out in a rush. I write for the same reason, to fill that space to the brim with dreams. There is a nagging sense of being incomplete when you are not in the act of reading or writing or creating or indulging in art, in a meaningful expression of ideas and emotion, and it really does haunt you. It is a sensation, a reality, captured in this book, in this ocean, and for a while, much as it hurts, you can swim inside it and marvel at all the alien things floating alongside the familiar. You can wonder at the coral reefs of imagination, the treasure chests locked tight, the shipwrecks spilling their guts into the water. I am reminded of an appointment I had with my Short Fiction tutor, Dr Sue Woolfe, which I had arranged to query her mark on my work. She said, among other things, \u2018You haven\u2019t broken my heart.\u2019 I was somewhat confused when I left her office, I\u2019ll admit, even as I said in parting, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll break it yet.\u2019 It is now all too clear. I\u2019ve been fumbling around in the dark these past few weeks and, seemingly without trying, Neil Gaiman has sauntered in and flipped the switch. So, yeah, it hurts \u2013 sudden light always does but hey, in a few moments when the blurriness and spots clears, I\u2019ll be able to look around at the pieces of my life, the unfinished stories, and assemble them with new meaning and clarity. There are always more dreams to sew into the patch in my chest, always another breath to expel (until there isn\u2019t) and in the meantime, I need only wait for moments like these, for books like this one, to tide me over. ...more", "Title": "The Ocean at the End of the Lane"},
