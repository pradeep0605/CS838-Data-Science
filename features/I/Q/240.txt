I disliked this book, which means I ought to rate it one star, but it is not as awful as my one star shelf. One star books have to really repulse me to get that rating. The only redeeming thing about <+++>The Night Circus</+++> is that I didn't feel the one star compulsion to start a bonfire so I could properly dispose of it, hence two stars, but in this case it does not mean I enjoyed the book at all. From the Goodreads summary: \"But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway\u2014a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love\u2014a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\" The above is a series of filthy, filthy lies intended to make you part with your money. Did the person who wrote the description read the same book I read? Or did he get so bored that he fell asleep and was forced to wing it for a deadline? If that's the case, I feel for the poor guy since I fell asleep reading this a few times, but I don't forgive the lies. Lie Number One: \"A Fierce Competition\" What Actually Happens: Instead of reading about a battle of wits, ingenuity, and talent taking place on a magical field you get two slugs racing against each other... over the course of sixteen or so years. Yeah, all those extra years might kill the intensity, but think of the emotional investment you make in those slugs. You can bring your new born baby to see them and go again every year as the fierce competition between the two of them goes on and on and on and on and on... (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. (hide spoiler) ] Your child will have a driver's license when the fierce competition is over. Lie Number Two: \"A Duel\" What Actually Happens: For a significant part of the story the two 'dueling' magicians are raised separately with no knowledge of one another. For ANOTHER significant part of the story only one magician is aware of who they are 'competing' against. By the time the magician who was unaware is finally brought up to date they have been collaborating on projects for years...<---F> Yes, you read that right</---F>. They never stand toe to toe in any sort of competitive sense. They build little attractions for the circus and sometimes they built them together, leaving gaps for the other to fill because they like each other's work. This is how they 'fiercely compete' during their 'duel.' Lie Number Three: \"Trained Since Childhood Expressly For This Purpose\" What Actually Happens: This sounds like a warrior toddler getting out of bed and doing push-ups (or the magical equivalent) every day for forever with the intent of search and destroy. In reality, they both have haphazard educations from sociopathic father figures* who never tell them a damn thing about the competition. They don't know what they're doing or how to play the game (and neither does the reader for most of the book). I believe this is because the author had no idea how to make them actually compete or what she was doing beyond establishing a lot of overly descriptive scene setting. The training is just education from two different schools of thought on the subject of magic. They're not given any idea of how to be the victor. It's an experiment, which is vastly different from training a warrior as this is made to sound. *The father figures are equally psychotic, suggesting that both of their philosophies are fundamentally flawed because they're both batshit crazy. One slices his daughter's fingers open over and over again to teach her how to heal herself, even smashes her hand to break her bones for a lesson, and the other does not know his ward's name until he is nearly an adult. Neither of them ever face any consequences for the things they do to the children or the many experimental children before them. Lie Number Four: \"Only One Can Be Left Standing\" What Actually Happens: Aside from the obvious (view spoiler) [happily ever after (hide spoiler) ] ending the author works in, there's no reason that one of them has to die. The previous \"battle\" before this one (I'm sneering at that) lasted thirty-seven fucking years and only ended because one of the magicians committed suicide. There's absolutely no sense of urgency in this book. It moves at the languid pace my grandmother's overweight poodle used to meander around at, like there was no where to go and nothing to do. The author tries to force some urgency and pacing in by having both characters willing to lose the game so the other can win... but why? If you're playing a game of Monopoly with a friend (Monopoly might be too exciting a comparison to use here but lets work with it) and someone's going to need to commit suicide at the end of it then you... don't stop playing. You don't even have to sit at the board all day every day. You can come back once a year and make a fucking move. No one in their right mind would jump up and yell 'I shall die for you my dearest!' especially if you know your friend will jump up and say the same thing louder. I don't know what happens if no one commits suicide? Does someone self-implode from excess magic? We never find out anything substantial. We don't know how past competitions ended beyond that single one. The book is left open-ended so that the publishers can milk this monstrosity all over again if it sells well. Lie Number Five: \"Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love\u2014a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\" What Actually Happens: After many, many years of not knowing who the other magician is, Marco reveals himself to Celia. The author tells you sparks fly. Sparks do not actually fly because these two 'characters' are about as flat as they come. There's no resisting falling in love. They just decide to do it in true Edward/Bella/Twilight fashion. There's no \"deep, magical love\". The love story is next to non-existent. On top of that, Marco continues to see someone else for years after... why? I don't fucking know. But it's a big god damn deal because she goes nuts and disrupts some of the magic of the circus and allows Bad Things to happen. There's so many other things wrong with the book. There's intertwining timelines. We jump back and forth decades in time, vanish off into characters who are at first totally unrelated to the circus and then have minor roles later on. None of the core characters are well-developed and none of the relationships are even remotely worth reading about. I don't get why the book is set in the period it was set in. Social standards aren't kept up. Maybe it was more atmosphere? Maybe it was so that the author didn't have to deal with the people who would show up to debunk the magic of the circus. On that note, the magic was so obviously magic that I got annoyed. I feel slightly insane for typing that out, but hear me out. It's all supposed to be real magic done with a wink and a nod so people won't realize it's real magic. Turn a jacket into a raven and then grin and wave so people believe you just performed the best slight of hand ever. Of course, the tricks were too fantastical to be believed. The wooden animals on the carousel breathe... and no amount of great mechanics could have made that happen 100 plus years ago. There's ice gardens and foggy mazes made of clouds , fires that never EVER go out, no one in the circus or relating to it ages (minus kids), and circus tents set up by invisible people. Everyone in the circus assumes the set up is done by assistants... what? assistants they never see? Where are the circus people when the set up and packing happens? Where do they think the crew goes after? Really, Book? Really? All of this happened as a contest between two old men who do nothing but sacrifice the lives of children so they can have the satisfaction of being right about things that are never. fully. described. One prefers things more obvious and in your face, the other is quiet and prefers a more book based education. Seriously? This was the propelling point for the entire novel?! The world building and magic rules also suck. Anything the author wants to have happen can happen with minor limits. The only reason to read this book is the lovely descriptions and abundant scene setting. I do not recommend it to people who like a good story, although if you're into abundant prose give it a whirl. It's kind of like reading a travel brochure while high as a kite. Edit: To anyone who has not read the book and might be making their decision to read/not read based on this review, I wanted to say many people I respect found more redeeming qualities in the book than I did. Here is one such review. Based on my experience, I still recommend reading sample chapters online first or a library trip. ...more Five Things About THE NIGHT CIRCUS.

And a weirder thing because it is essentially a glamour shot of the novel. It is not a lie. But it isn\u2019t really what the novel looks like when it\u2019s wandering around in its bathrobe getting coffee and trying to figure out if that smell is coming from the kitchen sink disposal or under the table. The resemblance is always a bit sketchy. THE NIGHT CIRCUS\u2019 resemblance to its cover copy is sketchier than most. 2. This novel is about a thing. It has people in it, too, but it is mostly about a thing, the eponymous circus. It\u2019s told in third person omniscient, which means it sounds like God is narrating the thing, if God decided he really loved black and white tents and fancy umbrellas. The voice that narrates this book is interested in humans, too, but mostly about how humans make the circus and the circus\u2019 magic interesting. 3. This is not a romance. There is a love story in it, which is good, because love makes the world go round, but it is not a romance. If you go in imagining to be swept off your feet from page one, you can keep on imagining. The novel starts before our lovebirds have hit puberty, so you\u2019re going to have to imagine for quite awhile. 4. The circus is not really a circus. This is fine by me, because I actually don\u2019t care for circuses. They smell, the animals always have that look of dubious maltreatment, no, I don\u2019t want to win a prize by shooting that thing off that other thing over there, and also, clowns look a little grubby to me. No, the Night Circus is a circus in the respect that there are tents, and there are performers, and some of them are acrobats. Mostly it is a place where pretty, pretty magic is passed off as illusion so that us muggles won\u2019t be scared by it. I\u2019d go to that circus. 5. This is not a thriller. This is a not an action-packed adventure. It\u2019s not even a simmering revenge or bubbling rivalry novel. It is a novel about a thing, with love in it, and it spans over a decade. If you have a problem with that idea, it\u2019s best you walk away now. But if you like Ann Patchett or Audrey Niffeneggar novels, or if you really thought JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL was the bee\u2019s knees, well. WELL. You have just found your next read. Enjoy. I did. ...more The Night Circus will be a 5-star book for a certain reader.

The book was good 80% description of various circus tents, performances, dinners and pretty, visual acts of magic. I did enjoy it for the first 40 pages or so, but it got old very, very quickly. It got tiresome, it felt indulgent. The remaining 20% were dedicated to: a battle between the two magicians that consisted of... making up pretty things to impress each other (yes, you read that right, no actual combating of any sorts in this \"fierce competition\") and a lukewarm romance that came out of the magicians' fascination with each other's creations from a distance, rather than interacting in any meaningful way. My resulting disappointment with the novel had also a lot to do with the writing style - Morgenstern chose to write in present tense, 3rd person. It worked well for describing imagery, but made the narrative distant, detached and the characters - unrelatable and flat. To be honest, I am not sure if The Night Circus can even make a decent movie (the rights were bought by Summit). There was not much drama there or action, the story was anti-climactic, the love was dull and the magic was only vaguely defined and seemed to have no rules and limitations. I am thoroughly puzzled by the book's comparisons to Harry Potter . ...more The prose sparkles, and the story itself is a feat of magical acrobatics. It's a hard book to summarize, but basically two ancient magicians set their two best pupils against one another in a magical contest. Its venue? A mysterious circus that only appears at night. The only problem: the contestants don't really know the rules, or how victory is determined. And when the contestants start falling in love which each other, things get complicated.

In the end I did some crazy, overly complicated math that really makes so sense in my head, and came out with four (which I raised to 4.5 because I'm such a weakling) stars. For the longest time during the book, over two hundred and fifty pages, I thought that I disliked this book for some very specific reasons, but this is where the confusing part comes in so hang with me for a second: once you get to the end, you realize that you only thought you hated those parts, and it was really all part of Morgenstern's brilliant plan! I know a few of you are probably giving me this look right now: Don't worry, though, I'll explain! Let me start by saying that this is a book you definitely have to read twice. The first time, you really aren't going to understand all of the nuances and parts of this story until, well, until it's way too late. That's something pretty special-and rare-about this book; it reminds me a lot of Great Expectations in that way. Let me try to elaborate with, since I know you guys love this sooooo much, ........ a story! Most books and/or series that you read these days, you pretty much know the whole plot (sometimes even books before the TSTL character does) and how it's going to end: in a predicable, sappy, cheezy, blah blah blah you've read it a million times kind of ending; sometimes even just a couple of pages into the novel. In The Night Circus , you really don't. The plot strings start out so loosely that you can see little to no connection to them besides the two obvious ones with Marco and Celia. You've seen loose strings before in many a sloppy novel, so you just dismiss out all of ones you deemed \"unimportant\" in your eyes and focus on Marco and Celia. Wrong move. You get more and more confused as the book goes on; what's with all the other POVs and time jumps? Really, just a general what the hell is going on? But that's not the truth; while you're so eagerly and attentively looking at your two little strings, Morgenstern brings all of those other little strings closer.....and closer......and closer together until, unbeknownst to you, she starts weaving them in with Marco and Celia. As I said, you're still in the dark about most of it, but you do notice that the book is getting better, but don't realize until there's only about forty pages left that, holy fucking shit, your two little strings that you started out with is now a huge, complicated, rope, but the book won't let you stop and analyze it. It carries you forward in a wave of sheer awesomeness as you devour every page. Then, you get to the end of the book, and your brain blows up. It literally blows into a million billion little pieces all over wherever you're sitting as your cat crawls all over you and nips your ankles (which is why I suggest you don't finish this book in a public place, because you will be incapacitated for several minutes and look like an invalid). When you finally get your brain back together, it almost blows up again when you realize that she planned for you to feel like this all along. She's been playing you and has had you wrapped around her little pinky finger from the start. Like Great Expectations, you're never really going to understand the plot and all of the strings fully until you read it through twice, when you can really fully comprehend every little detail that Morgenstern wrote into this story. Now that I told you about how my brain exploded about twice, let me get on with this review and tell you what I thought was annoying: What I'm about to tell you right now is not a joke. There are fifteen fricking POVs/main characters in this book that you're supposed to keep track of, and in case you still don't believe me, I'll list them for you: 1.Marco 2.Celia 3.Tara Burgess 4.Poppet 5.Thessien 6.Pospero 7.Mr. Barris 8.Isobel 9.Bailey 10.Chandresh 11. Widget 12. Mr. Murray 13. Lainine 14. Tante Padva 15. Tsukiko There are also chapters where she does it in POVs of other people from the circus, and sometimes she writes as though you're the one walking through it. Like I said, the first time you read through it, this can be very confusing and overwhelming, but once you read it through again, knowing the ending (and you can bet that I re-read this amazing book the second I was done with it) you truly understand these characters and why Morgenstern did it. And, no, I'm not going to tell you what at the end of the book made me change my mind so suddenly, you'll just have to read it yourself and be as astounded as I was. It's definitely worth waiting for. Awwww don't pout, I know you guys will love it! The other thing that hurt my head about this book was the seemingly obsessive amount of date jumping. We go from the early 1890's, to 1895, to 1893, back to 1898, up to 1901, back to 1899, etc. It was very struggling to read; she be in 1895 for a chapter, jump around through years for 5 or more chapters, then go back to 1985 like I was expected to remember everything that happened before, and most of the time it would be with different people than the ones I'd read however many chapters ago. It was hard, let me tell you, but what pushed me through, the amazing life preserver that Morgenstern threw me, was the writing. Ohhhhhh the writing *drools at the mouth* It is seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had the pleasure to read and enjoy. And for those of you that know me and have seen some of my other reviews, you guys know that that doesn't happen much at all. It flows so perfectly, sounds so beautiful, and uses just some of the most gorgeous wordplay I've ever read. It truly is stunning. Here's some examples that just knocked the breath right out of my lungs: The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. The towering tents are striped in white and black, no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick. The ticket booth clearly visible behind the gates is closed and barred. The tents are still, save for when they ripple ever so slightly in the wind. The only movement within the circus is the clock that ticks by the passing minutes, if such a wonder of sculpture can even be called a clock. The circus looks abandoned and empty. But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves. A subtle sweetness at the edges of the cold. The sun disappears completely beyond the horizon, and the remaining luminosity shifts from dusk to twilight. The people around you are growing restless from waiting, a sea of shuffling feet, murmuring about abandoning the endeavor in search of someplace warmer to pass the evening. You yourself are debating departing when it happens. First, there is a popping sound. It is barely audible over the wind and conversation. A soft noise like a kettle about to boil for tea. Then comes the light. All over the tents, small lights begin to flicker, as though the entirety of the circus is covered in particularly bright fireflies. The waiting crowd quiets as it watches this display of illumination. Someone near you gasps. A small child claps his hands with glee at the sight. When the tents are all aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign appears. (and here's another one) The woman wears a dress something akin to a bridal gown constructed for a ballerina, white and frothy and laced with black ribbons that flutter in the night air. Her legs are encased in striped stockings, her feet in tall black button-up boots. Her dark hair is piled in waves upon her head, adorned with sprays of white feathers. Her companion is a handsome man, somewhat taller than she, in an impeccably tailored black pinstriped suit. His shirt is a crisp white, his tie black and pristinely knotted. A black bowler hat sits upon his head. They stand entwined but not touching, their heads tilted toward each other. Lips frozen in the moment before (or after) the kiss. Though you watch them for some time they do not move. No stirring of fingertips or eyelashes. No indication that they are even breathing. \u201cThey cannot be real,\u201d someone nearby remarks. Many patrons only glance at them before moving on, but the longer you watch, the more you can detect the subtlest of motions. The change in the curve of a hand as it hovers near an arm. The shifting angle of a perfectly balanced leg. Each of them always gravitating toward the other. Yet still they do not touch. (one more, just to sate your guys' thirst) But that is before it is wound. Before it begins to tick, the pendulum swinging steadily and evenly. Then, then it becomes something else. The changes are slow. First, the color changes in the face, shifts from white to grey, and then there are clouds that float across it, disappearing when they reach the opposite side. Meanwhile, bits of the body of the clock expand and contract, like pieces of a puzzle. As though the clock is falling apart, slowly and gracefully. All of this takes hours. The face of the clock becomes a darker grey, and then black, with twinkling stars where the numbers had been previously. The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn. There is a silver dragon that curls around part of the now visible clockwork, a tiny princess in a carved tower who paces in distress, awaiting an absent prince. Teapots that pour into teacups and minuscule curls of steam that rise from them as the seconds tick. Wrapped presents open. Small cats chase small dogs. An entire game of chess is played. At the center, where a cuckoo bird would live in a more traditional timepiece, is the juggler. Dressed in harlequin style with a grey mask, he juggles shiny silver balls that correspond to each hour. As the clock chimes, another ball joins the rest until at midnight he juggles twelve balls in a complex pattern. After midnight the clock begins once more to fold in upon itself. The face lightens and the clouds return. The number of juggled balls decreases until the juggler himself vanishes. By noon it is a clock again, and no longer a dream. If you guys aren't sold on the snippets I just gave you, then you're all nuts. Certifiably nuts. In the end, I would recommend this book to almost anyone and everyone, as long as they actually know what an amazing book really is. If you're huge fans of these books: Hush, Hush, Twilight, Halo, Angel Star, etc, read nothing else but those, think that classics are stupid, out of date, books, and don't have enough patience to be able to truly enjoy a challenging book instead of just being half filled on pathetic YA tropes, then this book is totally might be out of your pathetic league. But for everyone else, READ THIS NOW!.......... or else. If you think I'm kidding..... I'm not. Just kidding!

Is that a thing I can be?), but it seems to me that the tools necessary to make a cake exceptionally pretty -- a vat of fondant, to start -- also contribute to the cake not tasting all that good (unless you somehow really like fondant, which is incorrect). Don't misunderstand me, I have no issue with cake. The right decorations, the right frosting (buttercream, preferably chocolate), the right consistency (moist, but not crumbly), the right layering (chocolate mousse) -- it is a perfect example of a food that does one thing, but does it very well. And that's fine. But a gorgeous wedding cake, covered in fondant and appliques, is only gorgeous until you cut into it, take a bit, and realize, hmmm. It's pretty and all, but you could do with a bit less artifice and a bit more of the good stuff. The cake part. The Night Circus is a wedding cake with fondant that goes nearly all the way down. It is an exceptionally pretty cake -- captivating, intensely visual, ornate and delicately constructed, with unruly swirls of back and white and surprising splashes of vivid red. But what is underneath? Oh, there it is... a little bit of cake, way down at the bottom. It's pretty good, too. Light, airy, a hint of chocolate and smoke. But all that sculpted icing has lodged in your throat, and it's kind of hard to swallow. <---A>Erin Morgenstern</---A> writes beautifully. This is a book about dueling magicians and bewitching enchantments, set in the Victorian age circus, so you can probably imagine what you're going to read, but she decorates her world remarkably well, creating magical attractions that are lightly sketched, allowing them to grow in your imagination (I want to play in the vertical cloud maze, and climb to the top and jump into a sea of wispy fluff). But good lord, just re-read that paragraph. Magicians, Victorian circus, cloud maze, sea of fluff? Eye roll? I've read a few circus books, and I should probably get it into my head that they are almost never for me, because too much of this stuff can get to be a bit much. \"Insufferably twee,\" I might have commented. Did I mention is is also a star-cross'd romance? With achingly, dippily sincere lovers? I mean, whatever, that's fine. I can handle romance, I can handle reading long, elegant passages about the sets of various Tim Burton films. Just give me a good story. But I don't think this book has a very good story. It is all setting, tone, establishing a mood. The story just kind of sits there, down at the bottom, under all that decoration. It isn't that interesting, and certainly not an entirely stable foundation. But maybe if it was jazzed up a bit? Put some filler in there -- a framing device, a needlessly fractured timeline. Does that make it taste better? Not really. The additional flavors are nice enough. They keep you eating reading, anyway (I can't remember if I am still talking about cake). Now for a paragraph that I won't be able to shoehorn into the strained theme of this review, but it needs to be said nonetheless: I don't like it when books about magic put zero parameters on what magic can do, or how it is. The magic in this book is unrestrained and excessive and after a while, very boring to read about. It powers the attractions at the Circus of Dreams, but with no restraints, the attractions can be, literally, anything. So why was I yawning halfway through the act? This book has received intense advance hype, and it will probably be a huge seller. Probably. But I'm not sure. If I wanted to further stretch my metaphor I would point out that you buy cakes at Jewel all the time but you only buy a wedding cake once. -- Addendum to Danielle Trussoni: I found your blurb on the back of this book to be as uninspiring as your debut novel . Do you really want to be the blurb-whore who speaks of a book that is explicitly about magic with phrases like \"so magical, there is no escaping its spell\"? Also, \"enchanting\"? Also, \"If you read just one novel this year, this is it\"? Really? As long as it isn't your book, I guess. ...more As a young girl, <---C>Celia Bowen</---C> is delivered to the father she never knew, a world famous magician whose secret is that his show is genuine magic - not illusions.

He teaches Celia to manipulate the world in the same way so that she can compete in a high-stakes game against Marco, an orphan similarly trained by her father's nemesis. The arena for this game is an elaborate, surreal circus. Neither Celia nor Marco knows the extent of the game, nor their opponent, until they have fallen in love with each other. I am going to blow the mind of everyone who gave this book five stars. My biggest problem with it was how badly Erin Morgenstern broken the cardinal rule of creative writing: show, don't tell. I will 100% agree that Morgenstern did an incredible job describing the wonder and magic of the circus. Her elaborate descriptions of magical tents and off-beat performers initially drew me in, though I worried about how long-winded and verbose some of her descriptions could be. Morgenstern's problem is that the plot and character development takes places mostly through dialogue and not action. Most of the significant plot twists were revealed by one character telling another, which took most of the suspense out of the story. I had the same problem with the character development. There was practically no exposition to give insight into these characters, no sense that they acted with reason beyond the need to make the story do what Morgenstern wanted. They didn't feel real. And the love story? Please. Dear Ms. Morgenstern: I do not believe two characters are in love simply because they say they are. They should act as though they are falling in love. Celia and Marco declare intense feelings for each other the first time they meet one another. The result is a juvenile, melodramatic, and inauthentic \"romance\" that I couldn't bring myself to care about. It's just like my friend's fourteen year old sister who declares her world-ending love for a different boy each week: \"This one's different. It's real. I swear.\" Similarly, it bothered me that the high-stakes battle unfolded in the form of Celia and Marco conjuring magical tents for each other...from afar. She did it from the center of the circus, where she was one of its main attractions, and he did it from London, where he worked as the assistant of one of the founders. I was expecting a dangerous, breathtaking game of one-upsmanship along the lines of the movie The Prestige . I know that the distance between Celia and Marco was necessitated by Morgenstern's love story, but it hardly made the game feel Life-and-Death. There was no suspense, so urgency, and really no sense of competition at all. Celia and Marco kept being told that they had to be careful and they had to up their game and that the battle would be coming to a head soon....but nothing ever seemed to come of these warnings. I never once worried that one of them was in danger. I would give Morgenstern four stars for imagination and creativity, but her execution falls flat. If you want to read this solely for the descriptions of the circus and the magic, I'm sure you will enjoy this book a lot. If you're looking for a well-told story, look elsewhere. ...more Find me on Instagram & Twitter ! \u275dWhen the final bulb pops alight, and the smoke and sparks dissipate, it is finally legible, this elaborate incandescent sign.

'The Circus of Dreams,' comes the reply.\u275e Rating: \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u00bd The Night Circus was one of my favorite books of all time when it first came out during my teen years. I didn't understand everything that happened in the story but it still remained one of my favorite, if not my favorite, books of all time. After reviewing books for a year now, I decided to pick up The Night Circus once again after reading and hearing about several other books that closely resembled the premise of this book, but were never able to top the enigma that is The Night Circus. I wanted to see this book in a new light, from a reviewer's point of view, and see if this book is truly the greatness I once remembered as a teen. And now, I've come to the conclusion that no matter how young or old I am, The Night Circus will always be my favorite book of all time. I could read it five times or a hundred times or how many more times after that and I will never be able to bring myself to grow tired of this book. Just the whole premise of the Circus, the characters, the illusions, the romance, the mystery... It all just takes my breath away. I have never read a book that's ever impacted me this way or stuck to me no matter the years that pass. I know that some readers don't fancy circuses as much as I do, and that's understandable. I've always had a soft spot for circuses and The Night Circus has sastisfied and brought to life the circus that I've only seen in my imagination. I only had two complaints while reading this book. One of those complaints was the slow pacing. I remember distinctly the first couple times I've read the book and skimmed through so many chapters because I was just so eager to get the ball rolling. I wanted to skip past Bailey's chapters, Friedrick Thiessan's chapters, and a few more chapters that slowed the book down in the middle. I still found myself wanting to do that now as I read the story this time around. But unfortunately, no matter how much I wanted to skip those parts, every chapter and page is a puzzle piece that connects the whole storyline together. Secondly, the Circus and the magic itself were so elaborate and unlike anything you've ever seen before that sometimes the imagery became a bit difficult to envision. There were so many beautiful tents and illusions but I just couldn't bring myself to visualize them because my imagination simply just couldn't reach those lengths. I give praise to Erin Morgenstern's writing and imagination for creating these beautiful enchantments that goes beyond our wildest dreams. I've been stumped at certain descriptions before but not like this! Though it may prove to be a little problematic for people who love to visualize certain details, I think it adds to the mystery and the character of the Circus. One of the aspects that put the cherry on top for me was the romance between Celia and Marco. The romance in The Night Circus may come off as instalovey for some and if it were any another book, I'd probably say the same, but it does not bother me one bit here. Although our characters only interact for a few chapters until they officially \"fall in love\", it feels as though that love has always been there from the very first pages when they were sealed and bound to one another at a young age. In fact, Marco and Celia have been separated for most of the book, with subtle hints of dancing around one another for years that when they do finally happen, you can't help but root for them like crazy and hope they have the happily ever after that they so desperately deserved. The Night Circus was absolutely captivating, outstanding, and just pure enchanting. Though this book does have its flaws, Erin Morgenstern's writing has a way of luring and hooking you into her story, and just whisks you away through a mysterious, magical labyrinth that is The Night Circus. This book will always be near and dear to my heart and has impacted me in ways I never knew it could. Of all the books I've read so far in my life, The Night Circus is, and probably always will be, a book that I'll always remember. ...more Sometimes I want chocolate.

I'm as guilty as the next person of the occasional vending machine pick-up for when I need those quick fixes. But then there's the slow anticipation. Take last week, for instance. It had been a few days since the last time. As I waited in line for my latte, my eyes happened to linger on a cute little cupcake, dark velvety goodness. Short, stacked, with a swirl of fluffy milk chocolate frosting. I resisted temptation, but the thought of chocolate lingered in my mind, and it was only a day or two before I found myself heading to my favorite chocolatier, craving the bittersweetness of an espresso-infused truffle. The overwhelming rich smell of cocoa as I opened the door. The charming smile of the clerk. The snap as my teeth bit through the dark chocolate coating, and the coffee-flavored richness of the silky ganache coating my tongue. The Night Circus is achingly beautiful. I'll concur with the critics that it might not have much of a plot, but sometimes the point is the storytelling. Morgenstern's writing reminds me of In the Night Garden in it's deceptively simple storytelling, of Peter S. Beagle 's melancholic and star-crossed lovers, and of Steven Millhauser 's love of ornate visual details in a magical environment. It's lyrical and evocative. If you want hair-trigger, gun-slinging action, this is not the book for you. If you look for slow, winding beauty, the walk in the sun-filled garden and the sparkle of sunlight off ice-covered trees, this might be your book.

This story made me want to smile, frown, laugh, and curl up into a ball and cry. Try to imagine someone taking Carnivale , Somewhere in Time , Something Wicked This Way Comes , and The Prestige and mashing them all together into a poetic, stunning piece of fiction with a beautifully melancholic, bittersweet ending. It made me crave magical autumn nights spent in a circus that defies the conventional laws of the universe, and somehow made me nostalgic for something I've never actually experienced. The imagery alone deserves the highest praise, and it is complemented by a powerfully poignant tale of love and grief, desire and loss, the magic that is all around us, even if we can't see it. It's not a fast-paced tale, it is meandering, subtle, and completely amazing. This is the kind of story that stays with you well after you've finished reading, a story that makes you gaze into the distance and sigh every time you realize Le Cirque de Reves hasn't materialized in your town overnight. For some reason, this book reminds me of autumn, my favorite season (perhaps due to the aforementioned similarity to Something Wicked This Way Comes ), and I think perhaps it will become a yearly read for me, when I inevitably begin to feel that pull to see orange, smell pumpkin, and hear the dry rustling of dead leaves as they dance down the street. My favorite part: \"They stand entwined but not touching, their heads tilted toward each other. Lips frozen in the moment before (or after) the kiss. Though you watch them for some time they do not move. No stirring of fingertips or eyelashes. No indication that they are even breathing. \"They cannot be real,\" someone nearby remarks. Many patrons only glance at them before moving on, but the longer you watch, the more you can detect the subtlest of motions. The change in the curve of a hand as it hovers near an arm. The shifting angle of a perfectly balanced leg. Each of them always gravitating toward the other. Yet still they do not touch.\" ...more \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0648 \u0643\u062a\u0628\u0647 \u0623\u062d\u062f

I suspect calling it a challenge or a game is not entirely accurate. I\u2019ve come to think of it more as a dual exhibition.\u201d So basically there were a lot of great quotes, fun scenes, and really creative bits spread throughout a story that was otherwise not terribly exciting or fast-paced. So I guess you have to be in the right mood for a slow and mysterious story instead. But ok this comparison was inevitable: It\u2019s kind of hilarious how similar this book is to The Crown\u2019s Game by Evelyn Skye . Like not just the general plot or the relationships of the enchanters to their mentors, but even small details like the love square, how they can go into the guy\u2019s dreamscapes, the dance, people turning into mist, how the girl loves snow/ice, and the points in the plot where she gets her fortune told or goes to his flat. I know they\u2019re totally different books, but seeing how The Crown\u2019s Game \u201cretold\u201d this story really highlighted what I wish this book would've been. The Crown\u2019s Game set up the rules and what the game actually was right from the beginning, so the story was instantly more driven, focused, and fun. It was clear why one enchanter needed to die. It was clear what each of their moves were and what was going on. In The Night Circus they\u2019re mostly doing magic tricks in a tent off-screen to \u201csustain\u201d the circus and the story checks in with them every few years. Definitely not as exciting. I just cared about the characters in The Crown\u2019s Game SO much more that it was kind of hard to take this book for what it was without comparing. The Night Circus was still a really imaginative, original, gorgeous read, though! I wasn\u2019t terribly into the first half, but LOVED the last 10%. And I think I would've loved it more if I had read it before The Crown's Game. But if you\u2019re only going to read one story about two enchanters who have to compete to the death but end up falling in love, I\u2019d go with The Crown\u2019s Game instead. Because fantasy Russia. ...more I remember when I was a kid, my Dad took me to the Circus, a small traveling circus with a few shows and a fewer animals, a circus that was rare even then and not heard of now of days. I remember holding my Dad's hand as we walked through the huge big top tent and feeling something magical and rare falling over me. One show that I can clearly remember even years after is of a young woman, a Aerial silk performer as she made the silk fabric dance for her with ease and grace as it wrapped itself I remember when I was a kid, my Dad took me to the Circus, a small traveling circus with a few shows and a fewer animals, a circus that was rare even then and not heard of now of days. I remember holding my Dad's hand as we walked through the huge big top tent and feeling something magical and rare falling over me. One show that I can clearly remember even years after is of a young woman, a Aerial silk performer as she made the silk fabric dance for her with ease and grace as it wrapped itself around and around her hands and body. Erin Morgenstern's Night Circus was much like the aerial silk performer as the story slowly and gracefully wrapped itself around me, unfolding at the same time a magical world with intertwining stories of the past, present and future. Of love, hate, hope, pain all bringing together a story that is unforgettable. The circus arrives without warning. Nothing has drawn me more into a book then that small little sentence. After that, Morgenstern\u2019s story took a life on it\u2019s own with me along for the ride. As we meet young Celia and Marco two children who are groomed at a young age to take up a challenge as they only learn about and don\u2019t know all the rules to as they become adults. This rivalry takes center stage in the circus, the Le Cirque des Reves with it\u2019s black and white tents. Their lives become more entwined with one another as their rivalry become something even greater- love. But with their love, the foundation, the web and the people whom are part of the circus are all effected by the decisions they make, no more so then the Circus- the beautiful magical being that it has become itself. Morgenstern\u2019s gives the reader a beautiful puzzle piece as she writes and jumps from past to present, this never became confusing as at times it answers a question you thought about, but just adds to the ever growing world. The descriptions of things take on something greater, as you can picture it so clearly in your mind what this object would look like and how Celia or Marco would create and perform their magic is just jaw dropping you tend to re-read the passage over again in amazement and awe. Everyone and everything is so well rounded from our two stars to their mentors and those who are part or love the circus such as the red scarf wearing r\u00eaveurs who delight in the magic and dreams of the circus. Everything is so enchanting that it\u2019s hard to put the book down without wanting to grab it up again or sharing a passage of the book with others. Much of the book just sticks to you long after, as you become so drawn into the circus almost becoming part of it yourself. There\u2019s some words of wisdom in the book that strike you deep in the heart and leaving you with some food for thought. The book will have a lot of different meanings to those who read and become capture by Morgenstern\u2019s debut book\u2019s magic. And that\u2019s one of the most beautiful parts I discovered about this book, that while it will mean something different to each reader, it will still bring a sense of deep joy and perhaps a children like wonder of magic and dreams back into our lives. ...more I never expected to like this book.

In detail, which means there's gonna be spoilery stuff, probably. Here we go: I don't like reading about circuses or parties or scenes of revelry and dreamlike wonder. I don't like reading about unrestrained, no-holds-barred magic that is only limited by the imagination of the magician, with no boundaries or explanation of how it works. I don't like magical realism. I don't like endless descriptions of every-fucking-thing ever. I don't like books without a point or plot or reason for existing beyond their own wank. And I REALLY don't like insta-love and completely unrealistic \"love will find a way\" stories. (And don't give me crap about it being fantasy either. That's just a shit cop-out for lazy storytelling.) Annnnnnnd since that's exactly what this book was, it should come as no surprise that I did not enjoy it. I know. I'll give you a moment for this revelation to settle. Why hello there, Clock. Fancy meeting you here! ...Are you following me? Ugh. Reading this (or I should say listening to it- but more on that in a bit) was mind-numbingly tedious and just all around awful. I can't think of a single thing that I enjoyed about this book. I can't even say, \"Oh the writing was good\" because the writing was so fucking purple that I feel like the Purple People Eater mistakenly ate something that didn't agree with him, perhaps one of the oh-so-interesting guests at Mr. Lefevre's parties, mmm? And then it shat out this book. He looks pleased with himself. So we have ENDLESS descriptions of parties, endless descriptions of the food at the parties, and the people at the parties, and the clothes the people at the parties are wearing, and how OH SO EXCLUSIVE the parties are, which is good, because for fucking fuck's sake if I had to endure MORE guest descriptions I think I might really have ice-picked my own face. Then we have ENDLESS descriptions of the circus, and the tents in the circus, and the ground at the circus, all of the signs at the circus and on the individual tents, and the food at the circus, and the non-tent attractions at the circus, and everything you can imagine at a circus and even 50 things you can't. And let's not stop at one example, or two examples, let's have ALL of the examples. If there's 12 chimes on the CLOCK during the lighting of the bonfire and each corresponds to an arrow fired into the cauldron where the fire will soon be lit, we have to have every last one of them described, in detail, with the seconds leading up to the first chime spelled out too (DRAW, NOTCH, PULL....RELEASE!). Described to the point of brainmush, in fact. Perhaps Erin Morgenstern thinks she's the only person on the planet with any imagination, because her descriptions left absolutely nothing for anyone else to imagine. Oh, no, I take that back. We get to imagine all the stuff she DIDN'T describe to death... or even bother to include. You know, like the plot. Or the magical education specifics. Or the moves in the OH SO IMPORTANT Challenge (capital C) that is apparently, supposedly, the point of this book's and the circus's existence. We are allowed to imagine that stuff, because, though we're told that they exist, THESE things are apparently not even important enough to warrant any explanation at all. Not when we have super vital things like CLOCKS to describe and hint at incessantly! Speaking of the Challenge-slash-Duel-slash-Competition thing... Could it have possibly been more lame? \"The first move has occurred. The earth shook and I felt a disturbance in the Force!\" \"What was the move? What does it mean? What happens now? Does this mean this story is going to actually start soon?\" \"Hmm? What move? OH, hey! Wanna see my dress? Let me describe it to you!...\" \"FML. I can't even. I just.... Can't.\" And that's the duel, until the point when *gasp* THIRTY YEARS AFTER BEING BOUND TO THE CHALLENGE, they find out what the fucking stakes are... and then they do (wait for it...) Nothing. The universe does all the work and these two \"main characters\" just get moved around like chess pieces. Only chess pieces have a purpose, unlike Marco and Celia. Moving on... I hated the way the story jumped around in time. And I REALLY REALLY hated the lapses into 2nd person narrative to take me inside the circus. I don't like circuses, and especially don't like magical, whimsical circuses of dreams (imagine me saying that with as much disgusted sarcasm as possible). I don't give two craps about the endless tedium tents of the circus, so those parts were boring as hell for me. I would also love to know how a pregnant woman in the late 19th, early 20th century would know that she's having twin babies, specifically. There was no sonograms back then, no ultrasounds to show Mom and Dad their little bun(s) in the oven, so short of X-ray vision, or some sort of precognition (which seems more likely), there's no way that anyone could have known. But no explanation is given for that little tidbit. We're just supposed to say, \"OK then!\" and let our eyes glaze over with the next 15 or 20 mentions of clocks, I guess. And then there's Jim Dale, who read the audio. I just can't stand him. I just can't. His voice and reading style make me angry. I hate when readers have to do the voices and can't let characters speak for themselves. He gave these characters voices that completely clashed with my impressions of them, and it was distracting. Not that any of the characters were truly remarkable on their own, but I'd rather them be unremarkable than memorable for being a distraction from their own story. But, speaking of characters, I didn't care about any of them. At all. Literally. I couldn't have cared less if an enormous sinkhole opened up and swallowed up the entire circus. No big loss. None of the characters were real enough for me to care about. Oh, we're told all about their personalities and whatnot, but for all Morgenstern's showing of everything else, her characterization leaves quite a lot to be desired. Marco apparently thinks it's OK to lead on his girlfriend for years, while cheating on her RIGHT UNDER HER NOSE... but that's OK, because he just erases those memories. No harm, no foul! Celia is just a Mary Sue. I actually forgot that \"the illusionist\" was her sometimes, because both could have been anyone. There's absolutely nothing interesting about her at all. Her magical abilities aren't a substitution for personality, you know. Celia doesn't even say Marco's name until the last 3rd of the book, and then only at his specific request. But I'm supposed to believe they are in love. Uh huh. But they have to be in love, otherwise the Love Shall Overcome deus ex machina trope that needs to die a horrible painful death would be out of place! Can't figure out how to legitimately get out of the corner you wrote yourself into? It doesn't matter! As long as the two Insta-Lovebirds are together, nothing can harm them or happen to them. The universe will (apparently) conspire to bring about the one solution that will be timed perfectly (know what shows the time? CLOCKS.) and will make EVERYONE a winner. Because everyone gets their reward if they just show up and then give up. Whenever there's a winner, there's also a loser, and losers are sad. The universe won't let you be sad, so it'll change EVERYTHING around to make sure everyone's a winner! No hurt feelings here! You'd think, that by the end, the glorious, long-awaited end, I'd have known better than to assume that there would be a proper ending, or any kind of sacrifice or trial or... broken nails or even a dirty dress or SOMETHING. Nah. Silly me. The end was so ridiculously \"perfect\", and fell together so effortlessly, that the ridiculousness actually cost me IQ points. What was the point of enduring reading this book? It has nothing to say except the tired \"If you just love ENOUGH, you can do anything\" shit that only tweens actually believe. So. There's no point, endless, tedious descriptions of things I couldn't care less about, the lamest conflict EVAR, and insta-love to boot. I wish I could give this negative stars. ...more The Night Circus reminds me of a wedding cake: breath-takingly beautiful and intricate, with an infinite amount of attention paid to every detail.

And, while you'll do the polite thing and talk about how delicious it was, in your heart-of-hearts you know that the simple homemade cake you've got waiting for you at home is infinitely better. Because a wedding cake isn't really about taste at all; it's all about flash, panache, and aesthetics. As your fork breaks through all the magic of sculpted icing, what you often find is that it lacks flavor and texture. All the effort went into the external and not the internal. That's how I feel about The Night Circus . It is unquestionably beautiful in its descriptions of the enchanting black and white Circus of Dreams and connects with you on the level of a child's awe and wonderment with encountering a world where the possibility of magic is confirmed, but in the final analysis what is missing is a story full of conflict, tension, and developed characters. It's certainly pretty to look at, but didn't resonate with me. The beginning of the book is filled with promise. Celia Bowen is delivered to her father, Prospero the Enchanter, after her mother commits suicide. Prospero is initially disinterested in the daughter he never knew nor wanted, but becomes intrigued when her anger manifests itself in the movement and breaking of objects in the room around her. Like her father, Celia has a gift for magic--a gift that her father uses to make a living as an illusionist, knowing that his audiences will never suspect what they witness on stage is real and not just sleight of hand. After training Celia to control her powers, Prospero contacts the mysterious Alexander, another true magician, and the two make a wager. Prospero will pit his daughter against an opponent of Alexander's choosing in a challenge that is never clearly defined to the reader. Alexander accepts and promptly plucks Marco, a boy with a love of reading, from a nearby orphanage and begins training him. {a few spoilers ahead; those still interested in reading the book may want to stop here} It's at this point that the book has a lot of promise and I'm actually getting excited about the challenge to come. And this is where problems start to surface. Several chapters segue into peripheral storylines not really deserving of exploration as they take the tension out of the challenge between the two magicians. But that's okay, because there's not a lot of tension there to begin with. Celia and Marco are trained for a challenge that's never defined for them. They don't know how the game is played (nor why) and they don't know who their opponent is. Hell, they don't even know what the challenge is until they've unknowingly been involved in it for a while. This is problematic because Celia and Marco have no reason to be invested in the challenge and neither does the reader as we, too, are kept in the dark in regard to all of these matters. It turns out that the challenge is the circus itself, designed specifically as a battleground for the two magicians and the challenge is basically to create additional tents of merriment and delight. That's it. No showdowns, no dramatic monologues, no tension, no pounding of wizard staffs, no ruthlessly executed tactical maneuvers. It's just \"I think I'll make a pretty, pretty Ice Garden\" followed by \"Oh, he made a pretty, pretty ice garden. I think I'll make a really nifty wishing tree\" and on and on it goes, where it stops nobody knows . . . or cares. To completely suck any tension out of this scenario, the two fall in love, which only heightens their disinterest in playing out the game. Their moves and countermoves actually become hidden messages to one another, tributes to the love that will never be. All of this is not to say that I hated the book. I liked it and I could certainly appreciate the beauty of the descriptions. Some have compared it to Neil Gaiman, which I disagree with as Gaiman would have infused the story with sinister undertones, clever word play and verbal sleight of hand to catch the reader off-guard, and more of a gothic feel. What the book really needs are two magicians who know exactly who they are fighting and why they are fighting--and both of whom desperately want to win. Without that, it's just a tower of lovely icing that leaves you hungry for more than sugar and beauty in the end.

The setting, the clothes, the magic and even the food are so magical and written in so much detail. (Seriously, prepare to play Hunger Games on your fridge.) Honestly, Morgernstern\u2019s writing alone truly deserves 5 stars, it's the only reason why I still gave the book 2.5 stars even though I have so many problems with it. I like to think of Morgernstern writings as makeup. You know when you put on makeup to make yourself more pretty or hide the imperfection such as pimple on your face? This is exactly the case. It\u2019s like Morgernstern conjured a spell of BB Cream and Concealer to hide the fact that there\u2019s so many problem within the book. Now I\u2019m going to talk about the problems, remember that this is all just my observation and opinion. 1. The main characters developments are close to none. For me, great character developments are one of the most important factors in my love for any book. Other than Bailey, Widget and Poppet (which don\u2019t have enough appearances, Bailey should\u2019ve been the main character rather than Marco or Celia.) I seriously don\u2019t give a shit what happened to any of the other characters because they\u2019re all so flat. There\u2019s just not enough development on them to make me really care. Even after knowing what happened to some of the characters in the book at the end, the only reaction I could give is 2. Extremely slow paced with no plot progression. I don\u2019t mind slow paced book as long as there is some sense of plot progression, character developments or great climax and satisfying ending waiting for me at the end. In fact, I really love slow paced books which took its time to develop the plot and characters carefully. However, in this book, not only the plot moved at a snail pace, there are so MANY unnecessary parts that could be cut out. Page 220-350 is a major snooze fest for me. All they talk about is the Night Circus over and over again which I get it already, it\u2019s magical. The color of tents is black and white, there\u2019s a majestic clock and a white bonfire, stop repeating them over and over again! These 100+ pages could\u2019ve been used to develop the characters and plot more but no, we get tons of repetitive description again on The Night Circus and unimportant information. Now let\u2019s talk about the most misleading part in the blurb as well as the rest of the problems. (yes there\u2019s still more.) 1. \u201cA fierce competition is underway\u201d and \u201cThe circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will\u201d I can\u2019t say much about these without spoiling the ending but I\u2019ll say this, there\u2019s no FIERCE competition at all. Don\u2019t expect any kind of skill, action or magic rivalry, there is none. Even the main characters don\u2019t know what the competition is about until around page 400 out of 500 which is really dumb. By the time it was revealed, it was super underwhelming and provide no intensity to the story whatsoever. 2. \u201cMorgernstern manages to conjure up a love story for adults that feels luxuriously romantic\u201d \u2013The Washington Post Whoever wrote this is either a kid, someone who read a different book or batshit insane cause the love story that occurred in this book is definitely not a luxuriously romantic adult love. It\u2019s instead one of my most hated trope in books, insta-love. The love stories happened twice in this book and guess what? Both of them involved one of the main character, (view spoiler) [Marco (hide spoiler) ] and are both insta-love. Both happened within ONE CHAPTER on their FIRST TALK with each other. The magicians in the story, especially (view spoiler) [Marco (hide spoiler) ] seriously need to use some of their magic to keep control of their libido. It will save some of the major conflicts that happened in the book. Overall, I don\u2019t like the book and I\u2019m really disappointed with it. It starts off really great only to loses its charm and magic quickly. Inflicted with a lot of problems, this is currently one of my lowest rated books in my bookshelves. I should state this though, if you\u2019re looking to read something magical, beautiful settings with absolutely beautiful writings ONLY, I\u2019ll definitely recommend this. However if you\u2019re looking for something with great story, satisfying ending, fantastic characters development, great romance or even an ant sized of actions, nope, I can\u2019t recommend this book. You won\u2019t find any of them here, I\u2019d even tell you to stay away but again, all of this is purely my opinion and my review, you could end up loving it much more than I do. As I mentioned in the beginning of my review, it\u2019s either you hate it or you love it. Sadly, like the quote in the book \u201cThe circus arrives without warning\u201d for me it\u2019s more like \u201cThe disappointment arrives without warning.\u201d [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more This book was...in a word...amazing!

They also don't know much about the competition at all, they just train on and do what they're told. As they grow up they learn more each day, and meet each other while working at the circus which is the venue for the competition. Let me start this off by saying that although I really enjoyed this book I could also see many people hating it. It all depends on what you like as far as writing style. I don't usually love flowery prose, but I'd say I have a high tolerance for it. I usually love a very quick fast paced plot, and this book didn't offer that. With this book the plot moved pretty slowly and it was full of descriptions. Morgernstern created a world that I truly wished I could have visited. She describes her world so well you will feel you have been transported there. As far as the \"fierce competition\" that was promised in the synopsis I never really felt that. I thought, in general, the parts revolving around the competition were lacking excitement and the end of that was a bit anti-climactic. I can't complain, though, because as a writer I feel she did her job. She had me guessing, imagining, and wondering throughout the whole book what exactly this game was about. She has me wondering how it would end, how it tied into the circus, and why we should care about this young random boy named Bailey. (I loved Bailey, by the way!) As far as the romance is concerned the author did it right. Some people may like the insta-love-at-first-sight kinda thing that is so popular in recent YA novels, but for me she did romance perfectly. I feel like the love at the end is so much sweeter if the story takes the time to build up to it. It also feels so much more realistic. Just knowing that since these two were 6 and 9 years old they were bonded and going to end up in love made the anticipation for that happening very great in my mind. For a debut novel I think this book was very impressive. I will say that it's not for everyone, though. Morgenstern's beautiful writing could have went on for another 100 or so pages and I would have loved reading every bit. This is the first book I loved, despite the fact that I wasn't in to the plot or characters too much. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a thorough, well thought out fantasy. Those of you who can appreciate a great build-up will probably enjoy this as well. Reviews for this book are very mixed based on personal taste so I'm sure you can tell on your own if this book will be for you. Being a usually impatient reader I expected to join the masses claiming this book was too slow or boring, but I was pleasantly surprised. ...more Full review now posted!

I first read this book 5 years ago when it was first published, and I absolutely adored it. The writing was stunning, and up until that point in my life it was the prettiest book I had ever read. I remember thinking that the Circus was breathtaking, and that I wanted to run away from college and live there forever. (As long as I could take my husband with me, of course.) The memory of Morgenstern\u2019s writing has stayed with me, and I\u2019ve recommended it to at least a dozen people since then. Because I had such good memories of the book, I was very hesitant to reread it. What if it didn\u2019t hold up? I\u2019ve read hundreds of books since 2011, so what if the book I thought was so lovely then wasn\u2019t as lovely the second time around? Thankfully, I needn\u2019t have worried. The prose was just as poetic as I remembered, the descriptions just as vibrant. I could smell the caramel and popcorn, feel the coolness of the Ice Garden, see the brilliant red of Widget and Poppet\u2019s hair and the rev\u00e9urs scarves against the stark blacks and whites and grays of the tents and performers. Reading this book is like stepping into a work of art. If the book was a painting, the scene itself was lovely, but I\u2019m pausing and taking the time to appreciate the beauty of the brushstrokes, as well. I could write of plot or characters or romance, but to me the whole purpose behind the story is the beauty of the setting and of the prose itself. That being said, I can completely understand why some people aren\u2019t fans of this book. For a book that claims to revolve around a magical battle to the death, there is almost no action. Very little actually happens in the book. And many of the characters are hard to connect to, because they\u2019re written so prettily that they seem more like sculptures than flesh. I felt like Bailey, Poppet, and Widget were the exceptions, and were meant to be the exceptions. This Circus might not be for everyone. But, if you go into this book expecting beauty instead of action, I think you\u2019ll find something exquisite.

It wraps you into its beautiful prose, unraveling a dream-like narrative that tugs on your heartstrings. You're left wide eyed and yearning for more, even though the wonder of the circus is perennial. The slow-burning built of The Night Circus is what initially threw me off; I expected full-on battles of wizardry and majestic illusion. Instead, I got mesmerizing subtleties of love speckled with war, of seduction and manipulation that simultaneously sizzle with fate's irony. And despite the need for more action, I was gradually hooked by the lovely words and clever storytelling until I realized I did not want to let go of the book anymore. \u201cWe lead strange lives, chasing our dreams around from place to place.\u201d In a magical duel that is governed by unknown rules, Celia and Marco are pitted against each other and the revenue of their illusions is Le Cirque des Reves and their spectators are the entire world. As a pair, these two are exquisitely refreshing. They do not shy away from manipulation, achieving Machiavellian traits around the edges, but their passion and intensity often allow for glimpses of the humanity that still resides in their hearts. Celia -- beautiful, calculated, a natural illusionist. Marco -- handsome, ambitious, a hardworking scholar. Two sides of the same coin, trapped in a dance of romance and death. \u201cI am tired of trying to hold things together that cannot be held. Trying to control what cannot be controlled. I am tired of denying myself what I want for fear of breaking things I cannot fix. They will break no matter what we do.\u201d What was immensely enjoyable was their clever moves on an endless board. Precisely because of this, because of them, the circus felt a different and solitary entity altogether. It was not simply a stage; it was a world. And they built it up and up in a wondrous manner, whimsical and enchanting and I could not help than simply feel bewitched by the attention to detail and sheer innovation at some renderings. \u201cPeople see what they wish to see. And in most cases, what they are told that they see.\u201d But props are also due for the author, of course, especially in the imagery department. Masterful storytelling, to the point that you are deeply immersed into black-and-white striped tents, eating chocolate popcorn and watching Tsukiko's performance. The slow pace goes hand in hand with the world building (if it might be called that) of the circus. The game, on the other hand, is a different matter. Sometimes the flawless tapestry of illusion unthreads and the dreams make way for reality in a disconcerting, hurtful manner. Quite sad to see, taking into consideration it also affects some characters for whom you are most likely to form an attachment. It just all goes to show how incredibly balanced a life must be, not merely magic, or merely non-magic, or just black and white, but magic and reality and black and white and shades of crimson. Every single character is distinctly portrayed and most win you over in no time. The eccentric Chandresh, the lovely Burgess sisters, the elegant Tante Padva, the innovative Mr. Barris. Surprisingly, I was quite fond of Alexander as well. Mysterious Tsukiko, not-so-special Bailey, lonely Isobel and kind Herr Thiessen are other great additions. But heartwarming feelings were augmented whenever Poppet and Widget were around; they are something else; they are the circus in a sense and perhaps that's why they are so incredible. One thing I tremendously appreciated was how central time itself, kronos, felt. From the puppeteers that started it all and have a curious bond with the flow of time (Hector and Alexander), to the alternative time parallels that embellish the narrative and how the game spans years and years, all elements within the circus are in sync. The clock, the birth of the twins, the characters' frozen aging, Isobel's appearance, Bailey, to name just a few. The complexity astounds me, making the novel timeless. And last, but not least, the ending in its bittersweet perfection. That is all. \u201cYou may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows that they might do because of it, because of your words. That is your role, your gift.\u201d The Night Circus is well worth the praise it has received. With hypnotizing flavors of enigmas and mysteries woven into its very essence, it tells a story about transcendent love, unending time and impossibilities given life through imagination. It is a tale of character and context at the same time, yet constantly highlighting the reversibility of life -- dreams might turn into nightmares, but nightmares might turn into dreams too.

The book this opening statement comes from is called The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and one that amazed me in so many ways. All my emotions were engaged as I read. I was enthralled to the point I wanted to curse Erin because I was utterly obsessed with this fantasy world she has created. Words are poetry where the writer is the artist responsible in creating beauty in every line. Erin Morgenstern has done that here and more so with The Night Circus. It\u2019s a ballet on the pages, an intricate spellbinding tale that will leave you breathless as two people, by no choice of their own, are victims of a game set out by two devious individuals. The prize is not certain or guaranteed. What is certain is there can only be one winner, one left standing, while the other wastes away, overcome with madness for the deceit and manipulation that rules their life until they can\u2019t take it anymore and destroy themselves. The Night Circus is told in first person present tense starting in the year 1873. We meet Hector Bowen, a showman and a magician known to the public as Prospero the Enchanter. One day he is sent a shocking gift- a five year old daughter, Celia, he never knew about. Celia\u2019s mother has killed herself and now Hector is forced to become Celia\u2019s caregiver. At first he has disdain for Celia, but he soon finds out how special and unique she is. He decides he wants to play a game, a competition. The man in the grey suit, sometimes called Alexander, has also played this game before. He and Hector make some sort of bet. Celia will be involved. Alexander must find her competitor. He decides on an orphan boy named Marco. For years Hector and Alexander teach and test their wards to build up their abilities. As the years go by, Celia and Marco\u2019s lives will become intertwined. When Marco grows into adulthood he meets a young woman, Isobel who can read tarot cards and begins a romance with her that may help him win the game. He becomes a personal assistant to Chandresh, who is indirectly involved in helping start a circus that will only run from sunset to sunrise, known better as the night circus. And then Celia joins the night circus as an illusionist, much like her father once was, but one with so much more talent. And when Celia and Marco finally meet, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re two sides of a coin, each other\u2019s sun and moon. But they both know that they must play the game until it\u2019s finished and only one of them can be the winner, while the loser will give up everything. The Night Circus spans thirty years, going back and forth between years as we see Celia and Marco build their craft, as well as pull in those around them who are unwittingly forced to participate in the game. The main question is, who\u2019s pulling the strings, manipulating the events involved? A higher power? Hector and Alexander? What if I told you no one? Everything that happens is a game of chance, a series of events that are like dominoes falling to one another. We follow Celia and Marco as they try to figure out their destinies. These two are just as sly and cunning as their \u201cmakers\u201d, but refuse to be pawns. Celia and Marco are unwilling participants who want to escape from the invisible chains binding them, but stay connected to each other. You\u2019ll be on the edge of your seat rooting for these two to find a way out. The secondary characters are so very rich and flavorful. We have the wonder twins, Widget and Poppet, who are as important to the night circus as Celia and Marco is. There\u2019s Bailey, a seemingly average teenage boy who is just as significant. Tsukiko, the circus\u2019s contortionist, is the voice of reason. Everyone here has a specific role, including the ones I haven't mentioned, but they don\u2019t know what it is or what the finale will be when all is said and done. The Night Circus is a cross genre fan\u2019s delight. This will appeal not only to the YA crowd, but the romance reader and the literary fiction lover. It\u2019s a supernatural, fantasy extravaganza that had me wanting more. When I read the final page, I hugged the book close. Erin has truly written a masterful tale that may span generation of readers. This was almost a perfect read for me, but one thing I felt cheapened Celia and Marco\u2019s feelings for one another is the Tsukiko\u2019s explanation on why this duo are so connected to one another and have developed a deep abiding love that transcends the stars. In a way, it seems as if the game has manipulated their feelings as well, which I find to be sad. I would like to think Celia and Marco\u2019s love is the real deal. This is one a smart read where you have to concentrate and be aware of every move and action, much like a chess game. And when all is said and done, you\u2019ll want to be a part of the night circus and never leave. Erin makes sure to pull readers in and not let go, just like the characters who have live and breathe the night circus and have become its soul. The Night Circus is a magical, dazzling book filled with such heartbreaking and bittersweet angst that almost bought me to tears. If there is one book you read this year, you must read The Night Circus. I want to have babies with this book and cradle it in my arms. Thank you Erin, for writing what I believe will someday be called a masterpiece. Bravo! ...more Some books touch your soul in unexpected ways.

Damn you Erin Morgenstern for making my heart long for the impossible! The wonder of the circus is captured on the very first page. It is described as a place of magic and wonderment; it simply appears out of nowhere. The gates, as the name suggest, only open at night. Morgenstern then goes further and teases us with descriptions of circus food and beverages; she creates a place that is majestic and thoroughly irresistible. The atmosphere that is crested throughout is spectacular. I want to go there. (Have I said that already?) Well, I\u2019ll say it again: I really want to go there! Like, now! Can you blame me? It\u2019s just all so magical and beguiling: \u201cThe circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des R\u00eaves, and it is only open at night.\u201d But, that\u2019s not all the book has. That\u2019s only half its wonderment. The circus is a mere stage for an old grudge match between two opposing magicians. The two have been at war for a long time, and they\u2019re using their two respective apprentices to fight their battle for them. The two are trying to create the most powerful magician who will best the other\u2019s student. The circus is a staging ground (a charming one at that) for the competition, and the two young students are little more than tools for their masters. Except here\u2019s the problem and solution: they fall in love (arrrrr!) This book wouldn\u2019t be complete without the romance elements; it fulfils it even if it is a little predictable. The romance that developed is handled superbly. It wasn\u2019t remotely rushed, though at the same time it was clear that the initial attraction was there. It was built up slowly and eloquently. The relationship that developed is believable and was, in essence, like the book: pure magic. I think it was intensified by the fact that they should have been enemies not soul mates; it made it feel like it shouldn\u2019t be happening, but was still unavoidable. It was all so good, and I truly didn\u2019t expect to like it so much. I\u2019m not fond of the circus because of the exploitation involved. This, however, was something completely different. \u201cThe finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones.\u201d I have nothing negative to say about this book whatsoever; I have no criticisms or complaints. For me, it was a perfect reading experience. This is a rarity because I normally find faults with everything including my favourite books. But, I overlook them.

The rivals didn\u2019t even know who each other was until halfway through the book! And the so called \u2018game\u2019? What exactly was the point? To prove someone gifted with magic was better at it than someone who learned it through books (or vice versa)? Each \u2018move\u2019 was supposed to be an additional tent in the circus? How did that prove anything? And the winner is the person who survives? So, what, exactly, does that mean \u2013 that the person who perishes somehow self-combusted from using magic? And just like\u2026 what? What was so \u2018mysterious\u2019 about everything? You can\u2019t just dance around in circles, waving your arms and going \u2018woooooo, I\u2019m so spooky and mysterious!\u2019 You need to actually give me some answers. It wasn\u2019t mysterious at all, it was just vague! You know when you watch magic tricks and you think OMG THAT IS SO AMAZING HOW DID HE PULL THE RABBIT OUT OF THAT HAT? Or OMG HE IS REALLY SAWING THAT CHICK IN HALF! And then you learn there\u2019s a secret compartment in the hat hiding the rabbit, or that the chick is really squished up into one half of the box, and the trick is forever ruined? That was like this book. Except without the magic tricks. \u201cBut behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway Behind the scenes? No, it\u2019s in front of EVERYONE.

Just because you never answer this question doesn\u2019t make it mysterious! Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Celia: La la la, I think I\u2019ll create a pretty tent. Marco: (two years later) Oh yes, here\u2019s another tent that has absolutely nothing to do with anything, and it\u2019s certainly not a new move in this \u2018game\u2019 (because how does that make sense?) Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love\u2014a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. Headfirst? Dude knows who his rival is for years before approaching her. Love from afar is not headfirst. And even if he was in love with her for so long, love without evidence is stalking. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. The game must play out? What game? Literally no one else is involved in the \u2018game\u2019. It doesn\u2019t affect the patrons, and it only weirdly affects the other performers because someone else stuck their nose somewhere it wasn\u2019t wanted! The best part about this book was the descriptions. But even they were presented peeking through fingers over eyes as if to say, \u2018If I look too closely, I\u2019ll spoil the MAGIC.\u2019 Also, I found Bailey and Poppet\u2019s romance more interesting than Marco and Celia\u2019s! The romance is definitely NOT and angle to promote in this book. That being said, I freaking loved reading about all of Celia\u2019s magic. Her colour-changing gown? How did no one realise that was real magic? I want one of those! This book was not for me, even though I believed BASED ON THE BLURB that it was. My problem was not with the pacing, because I could have read those gorgeous descriptive passages for a long time. My problem is that this mysterious duel between two lovers was never more than a fart in a Jacuzzi. ...more I just can't stay with this. It's tedious and overwritten, pretentious and full of endless descriptions. Way over-hyped. I think the plot idea had promise, but its execution needs a buzz cut. Or maybe even a vasectomy.

There's a love story blah blah blah too but there is just something so classically beautiful about this book. Also, carnival food: Where is the movie? And more importantly: where is the sequel?! Updated: 31 August 2015 (Note: Please pay no attention to the fool in the comments) Morgenstern\u2019s book should come with a disclaimer: may lead to bookish existential crises. I\u2019d picked it up as therapy, thinking it\u2019d fill the Harry Potter void, but I ended up with a bucket of feels and another hole in my heart. The Night Circus is all kinds of beautiful, and combines a heart-wrenching love story with gorgeous fantasy.

Cake without frosting. Sure, cake is good, some people will even prefer dry, plain cake all by itself, but others, such as myself, need the sugary sweetness of frosting. Some may prefer the milder whip frosting. Or maybe even caramel or candy to put the final touches on our taste buds. Either way, plain cake, no matter how moist, is not for everyone. Yes, the writing is beautiful. Beyond beautiful. It's magnificent and breathtaking; the detailed scenery, the magic, The Night Circus is like cake. Cake without frosting. Sure, cake is good, some people will even prefer dry, plain cake all by itself, but others, such as myself, need the sugary sweetness of frosting. Some may prefer the milder whip frosting. Or maybe even caramel or candy to put the final touches on our taste buds. Either way, plain cake, no matter how moist, is not for everyone. Yes, the writing is beautiful. Beyond beautiful. It's magnificent and breathtaking; the detailed scenery, the magic, the multitude of formidable descriptions of each tent inside this circus is all absolutely stunning. Furthermore, the approach taken to tell the story is excellent. We've got the journey in past and present, walking alongside the characters their whole lives, in addition, we get our very own walk inside this resplendent circus which adds a truly delightful touch to the story. Unfortunately, this is the only aspect of the book I enjoyed: The writing. While I appreciate more literary books, -- a lot of my favorites are slow paced, extremely well-read books that managed to not only tell me a story, but actually make me live it -- The Night Circus' strongly lethargic plot fails to let it radiate life within its beauty. Filling a book with pizzazz is simply not enough for me. I need a compelling storyline, I need fabulous characters. This is where I was left highly underwhelmed. The \"competition\" we constantly hear of is kept very vague, not really letting us in which only left me confused as to the point of the plot, not to mention let down by the absence of its \"fierceness\" that the blurb promises. Knowing that sometimes all I need is a little patience to eventually get blown away, I kept my hopes up and didn't give up. I was slightly more satisfied at the end, very slightly, though I was expecting much more out of this highly praised novel. If you want to read a book to simply enjoy its outward extravagance, I can see you loving it. However, expect over 500 pages of nothing more. Strong characters can make a world of difference in books such as this. Characters I would have grown to love, to adore. Characters that would have made an impression on me emotionally. A deep investment in such characters could have made this an instant favorite. Instead what I got were colorless characters with weak personalities that I could not have been less concerned about. Maybe I was distracted by the glamor (catch-22?), maybe it was all the back and forth; whatever the reason, these characters remained characters to me. I never got to know them. I never got to feel their presence, their soul, inside this tale. Where it should have been filled with passion and devotion, sometimes misery, this was only communicated with sentences, not with the actual emotions I was expected to garner. The only character I was mildly interested in was Bailey and his parts, though not insignificant, are far and few. Your enjoyment of this book will seriously depend on what you're looking for. It's an exquisitely well-written book full of riches and gorgeous descriptions. If this is enough to lure you in and enchant you - I assure you you will be blown away. If an engaging plot and great characterization are also essential for you to have a great reading experience, you won't find it here. Ultimately, you'll either love it, or you won't. Me, I need my frosting. -- For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads ...more \"Sharing secrets, real secrets, important ones, with even one other person, will change them.

Writing them down is worse.\" Oh, it is. So, so far worse. But I never enjoy a challenge that does not present its risks. That is why I am about to share a secret. I could begin with once upon a time (for there is no difference between well kept secrets and well told stories; both are conceived within the mind, but safer when hidden in the folds of a thriving heart; both, at last, are better told in a wisper, and for both of them is true that their most luminous treasures inhabit the silent pause between a word and the other); I could begin with the famed formula, then. But would that be proper? I am of the opinion that, in the case of matter, we can do a little better than that. So what about: Here, now, as you read this . I want to tell you a story. A man in a grey suit uses a silver ring to mark the finger of a little girl who, with half a thought, can break things down and put them back together. As good as new. The mark seals a deal. A wager. As that happens, you smell the smell of powder and watch the scene through its reflecton in one of the mirrors that line the walls of the dressing room where the pact is made. The dressing room happens to belong to the most talented illusionist in the world. A hint: his are not illusions. Years pass. (And yet there is no need to call this time anything other than now ). The same fate falls upon a boy. As the ring tightens on his finger, his pain echoes in your hand as well. It means that the game has begun. What game? Like chess, but not quite. Maybe, if the chessboard was a circus. Maybe, if a move was a new tent added to it: an Ice Garden, a Carousel, a Labyrinth, a Wishing Tree, a Pool of Tears (whatever it is or does). Someone may say that the circus itself is the game. And what do you say? \u2022You say that the book itself is the game , and that the book itself is the circus . You say that this three entities, book, circus, game, are one and the same, and thus not severable. You say that you don't know if this count as metafiction, as the ending suggests, but in any case, it bewitches you. \u2022You are overwhelmed by sensations . Your senses are overpowered . Smells, colors (or lack of), touches. Caramel on fresh-made popcorn. Walls of black and white. Imminent rain that stays perched of its coulds and does not fall. The scrape of a pen on a candid sheet of paper. The soft sound of the hand of your clock that goes on, on, on. You could swim in this world and eat from this table until your eyes are puffy and sore from reading. (Reading, are we sure? That feel so much like life.) \u2022Is it the writing ? You are not sure, because it never strikes you as particularly remarkable, or particularly melodic, or particularly anything. It occurs to you that its delicate plainness could be exactly the point of its efficency. \u2022The patrons of this circus are never disappointed, but you, only a bit, are. What's the matter, my child? We will come back tomorrow. You do come back tomorrow. The circus is there no more. And that is exactly how you feel when you realize that your impression of something being amiss is due to the fact that the romance 's pace is not right. They pass from interest (strong, yes, but still apparently nothing more than interest) to deep, mad love. And moreover, the fall should be like a dance, or like, indeed, a game of chess: moves and counter moves . And that's how it is, and it's enchanting, but it also feels unidirectional . (view spoiler) [Celia and Marco rarely appear on the stage together. You see the competition between them, you see that it is real. But while Celia works with the circus and therefore lives surrounded by Marco's creations, Marco doesn't. It is understanble that Celia falls in love with the conceiver of the attractions so dear to her, but what about him? He doesn't know her. (hide spoiler) ] You try to shake off yourself the awkward feeling of such an unbalanced relationship . You can't. \u2022While you accept that the mystery is a big part of the charm of the story, you can't help wishing things were explained more properly, especially concerning the ending . Because the ending doesn not satiate you, if anything, leaves you thirstier than before, leaves you with the convinction that your copy must be missing some pages . It's not a sensation you enjoy right after finishing a standalone. And now you have seen the contents of all the tents, seen all the attractions, tasted all the treats the circus can offer. You watch the clock: unbelievably late. But you don't want to leave yet. You turn around to look for something else to see. You find the circus has disappeared, unconcerned with your presence within its former borders. You wonder if it was ever there to begin with. You turn the page and read the word End , and you know it's just a figure of speech. ...more", "Title": "The Night Circus"},
