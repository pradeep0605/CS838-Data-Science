Even though I do not think it will spoil your reading experience, I am putting the warning here because one reader pointed it out. -------------------------------------- Before I begin my review, a statutory warning to all my patriotic Indian brothers and sisters... this is India-bashing, large scale. If you are the sort of person who gets all worked up when any aspect of India is criticised, this book is not for you. That said, Arvind Adiga bashes India where it has to be bashed. No honest reader will be able to dispute that the picture of India he paints is a false one. You will find the majority of Indians embarassedly changing the topic when Bihar (<---B>the state Adiga names \"Darkness\"</---B>) enters the conversation. Most of the things he mentions are not only possible, but probable and even likely. You only have to read any Indian newspaper over the period of a week to know it. But I believe the author fails in the creation of Munna alias <---C>Balram Halwai</---C>,<---M> the protagonist</---M>, because his voice is totally out of character with the person. It is the supercilious voice of a Westernised Indian, detached from his home country by education and station in life that comes through. The street smart Munna who murdered his employer and set up his business in Bangalore will talk in an entirely different way (for example, he will never say \"five hundred thousand rupees\" - he'll say \"five lakhs\"). Here, the character just becomes a mouthpiece for the author. Secondly, Adiga goes overboard in criticising India, so that some of his examples become rather extreme (the immediate one that comes to mind is the schoolteacher boozing and sleeping in the classroom). In some other cases, they are downright silly (Balram buys a dosa and throws out all the potatoes before giving to Mukesh, whereas he could have bought a dosa easily without the potatoes: these are two varieties). It also confirms the opinion I formed of Adiga from his bio that he is that type of Indian Lord Macaulay wanted to create: Indian only by birth but English in spirit. Lastly, the story failed to hold my interest. Take out all the social criticism and it is nothing but a hollow shell. And the gimmicks, like framing it as a letter to the Chinese premier, are trite to the point of being nauseating. The only thing that forced me to give two stars to this work is some of the pithy statements Adiga makes about Indian society. Especially the ones about how caste-ridden India was a zoo, with all animals in separate cages when the British let them all out, so now only the ones with the big bellies and the ones with the small bellies are left; about automobile horns during a traffic jam joining together to form a single wail like a lost calf wailing for its mother; and the one about how the major diseases India faces are cholera, typhoid and election fever (though I would also include cricket). ...more Well the stories of murderers and psychopaths are generally like cakes to most of us(and i am no exception). I either love such protagonists or hate them whole-heartedly. Coming to Balaram, the situation is different. I had never felt anything for him even after reading 300 pages. I didn\u2019t even hate him and I was completely indifferent towards him mainly because I felt that his character is artificial and inconsistent. Every time I read a cynical work or a satire I feel that I have become a bit Well the stories of murderers and psychopaths are generally like cakes to most of us(and i am no exception).

I didn\u2019t even hate him and I was completely indifferent towards him mainly because I felt that his character is artificial and inconsistent. Every time I read a cynical work or a satire I feel that I have become a bit more intelligent. But coming to White Tiger, the situation is again different. I don\u2019t think I have become intelligent by reading the book\u2019s take on corruption and class inequalities in India. Though I didn\u2019t like the book much, the one thing I really liked about it is the author\u2019s keen observations and it is the only thing which kept me going. In my view I don\u2019t think his social commentary on Contemporary India comes as surprising to any Indian. Maybe Westerners may find it interesting reading about the so called \u201creal India\u201d or \u201cThe Other Side of India\u201d. P.s:- Why is it that the authors who overplay the negatives of India are so popular? Maybe because they write books about India for foreign senses and maybe it\u2019s because they are doing a social service by bringing the \u201creal unknown India\u201d into limelight. Then why is Satyajit Ray accused of \u201cexporting poverty\u201d by the Indians for his lively and real Indian works ...more Balram Halwai grew up in the Darkness -- the immense swath of rural India where the poor vastly outnumber the rich and where the right of the rich to oppress the poor is rarely questioned. By dint of his intelligence and ambition, he becomes the No. 2 driver to a local landlord nicknamed The Stork, and when he discovers the No. 1 driver has been hiding a secret, is able to displace him and eventually move to Delhi with the landlord's Westernized son, Mr. Ashok, and his modern wife, Pinky Madam. Qu Balram Halwai grew up in the Darkness -- the immense swath of rural India where the poor vastly outnumber the rich and where the right of the rich to oppress the poor is rarely questioned. By dint of his intelligence and ambition, he becomes the No. 2 driver to a local landlord nicknamed The Stork, and when he discovers the No. 1 driver has been hiding a secret, is able to displace him and eventually move to Delhi with the landlord's Westernized son, Mr. Ashok, and his modern wife, Pinky Madam. Quite early in this debut novel, Balram -- writing a long letter to Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, who is about to visit India -- confesses that he has murdered Mr. Ashok, a crime that enabled him to move to Bangalore and set himself up as an entrepreneur. The flashback journey he relates in his letter describes how he came to that point, and in the process, it lays out a sardonic, seriocomic saga of the plight of India's poor. At one point, Balram tries to explain why the poor don't rise up to overwhelm their masters, and the best metaphor he can come up with is the chicken market in old Delhi, where live roosters sit powerless in cages beneath the carcasses of their freshly slaughtered brothers. He writes: \"Every day, on the roads of Delhi, some chauffeur is driving an empty car with a black suitcase sitting on the backseat. Inside that suitcase is a million, two million rupees; more money than that chauffeur will see in his lifetime. If he took the money he could go to America, Australia, anywhere, and start a new life. He could go inside the five-star hotels he has dreamed about all his life and only seen from the outside. He could take his family to Goa, to England. Yet he takes that black suitcase where his master wants. He puts it down where he is meant to, and never touches a rupee. Why? \"Because Indians are the world's most honest people, like the prime minister's booklet will inform you? No. It's because 99.9 percent of us are caught in the Rooster Coop just like those poor guys in the poultry market.\" This novel won the Booker Prize this year, sparked outrage among many in India, but more than anything else, it tells an entertaining tale with the strong, distinctive voice of a man whose soul has had to move from servitude to independence, and who, despite his horrific deed, finds the freedom to live by his own standard of decency. ...more The perfect companion piece to Slumdog Millionaire, and if you didn't like that movie, you won't like this book for the same reasons. It's a no-nonsense bulldozing mordant splenetic jackhammer of a story written as a tough slangy 300 page fast-reading monologue. It's a novel of information, not art. It tells you all about modern India with a traditional rags-to-riches fable. Our hero murders his employer unapologetically, and that's how he gets his riches. This is not rocket science.

It tells you all about modern India with a traditional rags-to-riches fable. Our hero murders his employer unapologetically, and that's how he gets his riches. This is not rocket science. This is smashing a guy over the head with a broken bottle of Johnny Walker. But 90% of the book is not really the story, it's an anguished howl of rage about a distance of eighteen inches. In India, and indeed in other places too, the Rich and the Poor inhabit different universes. But the rich hire some of the poor as servants. This novel is the story of a servant who was a driver. In the car, the driver is separated from his employer (the word used here is Master) by the short distance of 18 inches. But economically, psychologically, medically, it's really 400 light years, as we know. And yet, every day, there they are, cheek by jowl, 18 inches apart, the one regarding the other with irritated amusement or annoyance or contempt, depending on mood, and being reciprocated with fawning fear and even awe. Our hero Balram is the rare beast (white tiger) who does not succumb to this fear and awe. But it's a struggle, and I was glad to be along for the ride. In the London Review of Books, Sanjay Subrahmanyam almost trashes <+++>The White Tiger</+++>. His main beef is the language of the novel : \"What of Balram Halwai? What does he sound like? Despite the odd namaste, daal, paan and ghat, his vocabulary is not sprinkled with North Indian vernacular terms. His sentences are mostly short and crudely constructed, apparently a reflection of the fact that we\u2019re dealing with a member of the \u2018subaltern\u2019 classes. He doesn\u2019t engage in Rushdian word-play. But he does use a series of expressions that simply don\u2019t add up. He describes his office as a \u2018hole in the wall\u2019. He refers to \u2018kissing some god\u2019s arse\u2019, an idiomatic expression that doesn\u2019t exist in any North Indian language. \u2018Half-formed ideas bugger one another, and make more half-formed ideas\u2019 and the Chinese prime minister is advised never to \u2018let that blasphemous idea into your yellow skull\u2019. On another matter, he sneers: \u2018They\u2019re so yesterday.\u2019 A clever little phrase appears: \u2018A statutory warning \u2013 as they say on cigarette packs \u2013 before we begin.\u2019 Dogs are referred to as \u2018mutts\u2019. Yet whose vocabulary and whose expressions are these? On page after page, one is brought up short by the jangling dissonance of the language and the falsity of the expressions. This is a posh English-educated voice trying to talk dirty, without being able to pull it off. This is not Salinger speaking as Holden Caulfield, or Joyce speaking as Molly Bloom. It is certainly not Ralph Ellison or James Baldwin, whom Adiga has claimed as his models in speaking for the underdog. What we are dealing with is someone with no sense of the texture of Indian vernaculars, yet claiming to have produced a realistic text.\" and then devastatingly: \"The paradox is that for many of this novel\u2019s readers, this lack of verisimilitude will not matter because for them India is and will remain an exotic place. This book adds another brick to the patronising edifice it wants to tear down.\" He's right, it didn't matter to me that a guy who doesn't speak English is represented as using hundreds of idiomatic English phrases. But for me that problem is the same as the one posed by the question \"how can this first person narrator remember conversations in detail which happened years ago and anyway, who the hell is she talking to?\" - i.e. it's a device, we suspend our disbelief, we do it all the time : every time we watch a movie we could be asking ourselves (but don't) \"whose point of view is this all from?\". Who gathered all those documents together to form the text known as the novel \"Dracula\"? Well, no one, because Bram Stoker made it all up. How could Clarissa have found the time to write all those long, long letters in \"Clarissa\"? And so on. (note : Subrahmanyam was the only really dissident voice I found regarding <+++>The White Tiger</+++> so I thought his argument was worth considering.) Postscript The White Tiger is the 9th Booker Prize Winner I've read and redresses the balance between the Splendid (this one, Midnight's Children, Remains of the Day and Sacred Hunger) and the What Were They Thinking (Life & Times of Michael K, Hotel Du Lac, Possession, Life of Pi and especially, remarkably, horrendously, Vernon God Little). ...more I have just this minute finished this book and I can already tell that it will be one of those books that I will think about often. It's not a book whose plot I can easily explain, or a book that I can easily fit into a particular genre on my shelves, but my God did it pack a powerful punch. I have hardly been able to put it down between sittings.

I have hardly been able to put it down between sittings. The books is narrated via a letter from Balram Halwai, a slum-dweller-turned-driver-turned-murderer-turned-entrepreneur, to the Chinese President before the latters' trip to India and it is here that we follow Balram on an amazing journey through his life (I say \"amazing\" but undoubtedly typical of many in India). Although the slums of India and the government / police etc curruption is nothing I haven't come across before in books or films I still found myself shocked on almost a page-by-page basis. I liked the fact that there was no real hero in this book. There are no winners in a society like this. This book is engrossing, shocking, humbling and eye-opening but it is narrated in such a way that there were laugh-out-load moments too. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I feel a little sad now it has come to an end. I will be watching for more of Adiga's work in the future. ...more The \"White Tiger of Bangalore\" is cunning, fast & intrepid-- the perfect symbol for this perfect novel that reminds the reader of characters like Scarface and friends-- antiheroes all. Adiga's yarn is utterly engrossing; it's a mystery unraveled in the purest tradition of classic storytelling. It has that picaresque quality (which is one of the hardest tricks for a novelist to pull off, truly, really) needed to balance out all the heaviness of a constant train of melancholic events (violence The \"White Tiger of Bangalore\" is cunning, fast & intrepid-- the perfect symbol for this perfect novel that reminds the reader of characters like Scarface and friends-- antiheroes all.

It has that picaresque quality (which is one of the hardest tricks for a novelist to pull off, truly, really) needed to balance out all the heaviness of a constant train of melancholic events (violence and tenderness masterfully intermingled), an oppressive setting (modern day India), and a tale that when stripped of its resplendent coat of heavy whites and blacks, is all pulpy, red, meaty, nasty-- still retaining a beauty that is more than the reader expected or felt entitled to. Coincidentally, it has hints of some of my favorite books/film: Ishiguro's \"Remains of the Day\", Indra Sinha's \"Animal's People\" & Danny Boyle's \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" I wholly give FULL endorsement to this marvelously universal yet blissfully irreverent novel. ...more Best contemporary novel I've read this year. Antidote for the pastel lyricism of most mainstream novels coming out of India and a wonderful social satire with savage bit. Kind of like Terry Southern's best work if he hadn't been all weeded up and goofy. An image from it that sticks with me is how Ghandi's image gets appropriated by the current Indian bureaucracy. Whenever the narrator encounters the hanging Ghandi portrait he sees it as a symbol of \"bribes work here, corruption at work\". Perhap Best contemporary novel I've read this year.

Whenever the narrator encounters the hanging Ghandi portrait he sees it as a symbol of \"bribes work here, corruption at work\". Perhaps a statement that passive non-resistance is just what a huge corporate government wants to see in its citizenry. Also poignantly captures the vast differences between the two Indias. The upper class world of Bangalore computer outsourcing money and the servant class that still lives in the middle ages. ...more Really Witty I'm not sure what I expected going into this book but it wasn't really this. The book was very tongue in cheek and I could completely sympathize with our narrator even at the end. The idealistic part of me was a little horrified and upset by a lot of it but I think it's pretty realistic and really made me think about the servant/master dynamic in a way I hadn't considered before.

This grim world is far removed from the glossy images \"If we were in India now, there would be servants standing in the corners of this room and I wouldn't notice them.

It is a provocative book as it paints an unflattering portrait of India as a society racked by corruption and servitude, exposing the country's dark side. This grim world is far removed from the glossy images of Bollywood stars and technology entrepreneurs. -- The author The entire novel is narrated through seven letters by Balram Halwai, an exceedingly charming, egotistical admitted murderer, to the Premier of China, who will soon be visiting India. Balram is an Indian man from an impoverished background, born into the 'darkness' of rural India. His family is from the Halwai caste, a caste that indicates sweet-makers. His village is dominated and oppressed by four landlords. Balram gets a break when he goes to work for one of the landlords, and then ends up moving to Delhi via a job as driver to Mr Ashok, the landlord's son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation; crime, corruption, greed, adultery, prostitution and alcohol abuse. I enjoyed this book. Caught up in Balram's world, and his wonderful turn of phrases, the pages turned themselves, brimming with idiosyncrasy, sarcasm, cunning, and often hilarious. \"Apparently, sir, you Chinese are far ahead of us in every respect, except that you don't have entrepreneurs. And our nation, though it has no drinking water, electricity, sewerage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy, or punctuality, does have entrepreneurs. Thousands and thousands of them. Especially in the field of technology.\" There was also a great deal of sadness in the book, especially the treatment of the underclass who built the city, and are trapped there, hidden from plain view, employed in poor conditions and at low grade jobs, and in some cases held in slavery conditions. Balram refers to this as the \"rooster coop\". \"Hundreds of pale hens and brightly coloured roosters, stuffed tightly into wire-mesh cages, packed as tightly as worms in a belly, pecking each other and shitting on each other, jostling just for breathing space; the whole cage giving off a horrible stench \u2013 the stench of terrified, feathered flesh.\" The White Tiger brilliantly portrays the emotions, sorrows, and aspirations of the poor. For Adiga, his achievement is capturing a stirring, a glimmer of a refusal by the poor to accept the fate ordained for them by their masters. A splendid, perceptive book. A narrative genius. ...more This was a great, darkly humorous book a friend recommended to me stating that it was her favourite book of 2012. I can definitely see why. In this novel we find Balram Halwai, a sweetmaker from a small Indian village. He is from a low caste and finds a job working as a servant/driver to a rich Indian man. Halwai eventually escapes from his caste in a very unconventional way; by killing his boss. He then narrates his actions to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, whom he admires greatly.

Halwai eventually escapes from his caste in a very unconventional way; by killing his boss. He then narrates his actions to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, whom he admires greatly. This book is a satire, the narrator is hilarious at times. Underneath the satirical element is the fact that India has social issues. Adiga contrasts the \"New India\" with the \"Old India\", which he calls \"the Darkness.\" He paints the Darkness as very gross and desperate, poverty-stricken, illiterate and superstitious. The new India isn't free from criticism either; it is labelled as being rife with corruption. I guess the point Adiga is trying to make is that despite the fact that India has reaped a lot of economic successes from globalization, not everyone is benefitting from it. Perhaps some people may think Adiga was too harsh with his portrayal of India. However, I believe Adiga is giving a voice to the voiceless; the poor in India, those living in the Darkness, those people who are illiterate, suffering from leprosy etc., and it is important not to sweep societal problems under the rug. All in all a very enjoyable book. ...more I've read this book while it was still unpublished manuscript and fell in love immediately... Because it gave me the same pleasure as Vikas Swarup's Q&A...

On English trains you have a corridor opposite the toilets, also used for storing bicyles on the journey, where there are also two or three collapsible and uncomfortable seats. It is rather noisy but this was where the girl with curly hair was sitting and for the two hours of the journey she barely looked up. Now I know why. This is a genuinely good book and, thanks to history, Indian journalist, Aravind Adiga, wrote his first novel not in Hindi but in English. [We will never hear either the truth or novelistic version of the truth about a Tajik or an Uzbek, so long as their literature remains untranslated and will most likely never be written in English]. But this is not 'Passage to India' - it is the story of one man's struggle out of poverty written by someone who has seen both the poverty of India and the outside world that wallows in its wealth without shame. Told through the story of a young man who leaves his small poverty stricken village to become a driver to a rich businessman, it will lead the reader to question why the poor are poor and why the rich are rich and why the twain never meet. It is not pretty but, written in the form of a letter in 7 bites to the visiting Premier of China, it works. ...more A stunning first person narrative about a self-proclaimed murderer and entrepreneur.

Balram\u2019s journey takes him from the village and menial jobs, to the job of driver-cum-servant for a rich master in Dehli and finally to running his own thieving company. There is a strong comic element in the book and also a vein of satire about India as it is today. The satire as ever satirises the rich and powerful and there is a touch of the Robin Hoods about it (just). The rich entrepreneurs and politicians are, of course greedy, corrupt and conniving; but there is an amorality about the book which I found slightly concerning. The poor are actually pretty much as bad as the rich; just lacking opportunity. As a view of human nature it is amusing, but ultimately depressing. The satirical element is generally great fun with digs at the caste system, globalisation, political corruption, family ties and relationships between the sexes. Adiga himself has said this is about the quest for freedom; but for me it illustrates one of the curses of modern life, the rise of individualism and decline of community. Balram\u2019s focus is on himself, not his family or the community around him. That being said parts are very funny. However for me there was something missing; I didn\u2019t really find the characters convincing and the whole thing was a little insubstantial and the language slightly odd. On reflection I think the main character is the problem, for me as he just doesn\u2019t ring true (in my opinion). It is funny though. ...more Postcolonial lite.

Just a bit, now. Oh, this book was okay. Fine, actually it was an entertaining and engaging rags-to-riches story about injustice and inequality in a changing India, but I am pretty mystified about what the big deal's supposed to be. The blurb on the cover calls it \"one of the most powerful books I've read in decades,\" which makes me wonder how many books the reviewer for, um, okay, USA Today has read recently. Again, not bad -- I particularly liked the first half, about growing up insanely poor in the Indian sticks -- but again, I don't get what the huge fuss is about. To be honest, I might have given it three stars if it hadn't won the Booker and made a bunch of Best of the Year lists.... and if it hadn't really started to irritate me in the second half. Ultimately, his descriptions of modern India seemed rich and compelling (I have no idea how accurate they were), but the main character was incredibly annoying and fake. It was like watching a cheap cardboard puppet bouncing around in front of a much more carefully designed backdrop, which he keeps on blocking with his tiresome movements, and distracting me from with his incredibly annoying manner of speech....

For those living in the West, I suspect very few if any. That peculiar institution has died out there, and most would now find it intrusive and demeaning. The institution is, however, quite alive and well in many parts of Asia where maids--usually from the Philippines, Sri Lanka or Indonesia--form part of the family nucleus. I do say \"family nucleus\" because a lucky or successful maid will insinuate herself into the family such that she becomes indispensible to her employers. Such employers will often say that XYZ is \"like family\". The truth, however, is that she is like family only so long as she knows her place. Her lot is to be a part of the family, but always apart from it. In the past, when the West had its own master and servant classes, the paradoxes of that relationship were examined in the novel. Think of Wodehouse and the Jeeves stories and Robin Maugham's The Servant to name but two. To that list, I guess we can add The White Tiger , for--to me--the major strength of this novel was the way it captured that peculiar dynamic between master and servant: a strange and noxious mix of love and loathing, fear and dependence. In a marriage, a psychologist would call it a co-dependent relationship, and counsel both parties to stop. While it might be too reductionist to regard this novel as a simple story of servant abuse, that was where the novel rang the most true to me: in its depiction of that dynamic of co-dependence that corrupts and corrodes both master and servant. As much as I liked it, however, I was left in the end with an uneasy feeling of exploitation. Maybe I'm reading too much into this novel, but doesn't that master-servant relationship also speak of the current co-dependence between the West as employer and the East as workshop/call centre employee? And does not the fear of the servant slitting the master's throat ultimately pander to the notion that the \"brown and yellow people\" will rise up to overtake the West? And does it not then simultaneously also assuage that fear by belittling the barbaric state of Indian politics and commerce? Or maybe I'm just an unremdeemable cynic. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Telegraph : \"Gridlocked in corruption, greed, inhumanity and absolute inequality--of class, caste, wealth, religion--this India is unredemptive. What Adiga lifts the lid on is also inexorably true: not a single detail in this novel rings false or feels confected. The White Tiger is an excoriating piece of work, stripping away the veneer of 'India Rising'. That it also manages to be suffused with mordant wit, modulating to clear-eyed pathos, means Adiga is going places as a writer.\" The Complete Review : \"There are some good ideas here, and the writing (bit by bit, at least) isn't bad, but the whole is disappointing. \" The Times : \"In The White Tiger Adiga's character is India itself and this author does not creep. His language is brisk, his methods brutal, his intention to flip the subcontinent over and shine his spotlight on itsunderbelly, revealing the corruption and degradation that lie beneath the economic miracle. There is scope here for real depth. ... But the moment does not come and we are left with the glare of Adiga's lighting and his tigerish rage in scene after savage and unsustaining scene.\" ...more This is the kind of book that many people try to write and few succeed at.

The author is a former Time magazine writer and the first great thing he accomplishes is painting an effortless picture of modern India, from its poorest slums to the wealthier areas where more Westernized Indians make a living doing computer and telephone work for American companies (and then go spend their salaries at shopping malls). You learn a ton about India, but the author feeds it to you so smoothly and with so much humor, it goes down like really good chocolate cake. He also manages to write a book in epistolery form (it's six long emails written on six nights) that isn't a total bore. It moves very quickly and yes, there actually IS a plot, and a good one at that. The plot isn't even the best part of this book, though (although he accomplishes the feat of making the action take place in past, present and future, like Proust \u2014 but easier to read and comprehend). The characters he creates are also so real and so recognizable, so human, and easy to sympathize with AND hate at the same time; which is amazing since he is writing about a country and culture that are so foreign (to me at least). The White Tiger is like a bildungsroman about a young Indian man who has to crawl out of the mud of impoverished horrible village life and swim up toward the \"light\" of a life of wealth and ease. And corruption. This book is very deep and multilayered but it reads as easily as the best popular fiction. It is a rare book where, when it ends, you feel that it has been exactly as long as it should be. And even though I knew what was going to happen in the end, I was surprised by the lessons the main character learned along the way, and the way he expressed them. ...more There was a time when I stopped reading Indian novels.

And it pretty much does what it says on the cover. It\u2019s a very unapologetic, rough kind of rags-to-riches story. It explores the very complicated relationship between the servant and his master. It\u2019s one of those books in which the narrator starts off with saying \u201cI killed a man. Now, here let me tell you why,\u201d and the novel doesn\u2019t suffer from this apparent spoiler. It\u2019s a very sad story filled with corruption, crime and a general sense of pointlessness, where morality seem a luxury almost no one can afford, told by the addictive voice of the narrator. For an interesting twist on your traditional Indian tale Adiga offers the narrator\u2019s view on male oppression in the country. Balram, the main character, is constantly harassed by his grandmother and aunts. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Kishan\u2019s body. They were eating him alive in there! They would do the same thing to him that they did to Father \u2013 scoop him out from the inside and leave him weak and helpless, until he got tuberculosis and died on the floor of a government hospital, waiting for some doctor to see him, spitting blood on this wall and that!\u201d Let\u2019s take that with a grain of salt, shall we. Generally the book has been liked all around. In Paul Bryant\u2019s review I found a quote from a review from London Review of Books, seemingly, the only negative one: \"What of Balram Halwai? What does he sound like? Despite the odd namaste, daal, paan and ghat, his vocabulary is not sprinkled with North Indian vernacular terms. His sentences are mostly short and crudely constructed, apparently a reflection of the fact that we\u2019re dealing with a member of the \u2018subaltern\u2019 classes. He doesn\u2019t engage in Rushdian word-play. But he does use a series of expressions that simply don\u2019t add up. He describes his office as a \u2018hole in the wall\u2019. He refers to \u2018kissing some god\u2019s arse\u2019, an idiomatic expression that doesn\u2019t exist in any North Indian language. \u2018Half-formed ideas bugger one another, and make more half-formed ideas\u2019 and the Chinese prime minister is advised never to \u2018let that blasphemous idea into your yellow skull\u2019. On another matter, he sneers: \u2018They\u2019re so yesterday.\u2019 A clever little phrase appears: \u2018A statutory warning \u2013 as they say on cigarette packs \u2013 before we begin.\u2019 Dogs are referred to as \u2018mutts\u2019. Yet whose vocabulary and whose expressions are these?\u201d Well, that\u2019s just bananas. Maybe the whole book should just be written in Hindi for the sake of accuracy? I\u2019m writing a novel in English which talks about Poland and Polish people. There is a scene in which one of my characters decides not to name her daughter \u2018Mary\u2019 after all saying that \u2018Mary sounded too docile, little Mary that had a little lamb.\u2019 And I just can\u2019t wait for someone to point it out to me that a Polish woman in 1981 was not likely to know an English nursery rhyme about Mary and her lamb. Well, if/when I\u2019m working on a Polish version of it will be changed to \u201cLittle orphan Mary and the dwarves\u201d, which is, I suppose, culturally accurate but would be completely unintelligible to an English reader. ...more The central character and narrator of this novel -- Balram, the \"White Tiger\" -- is like an Indian Raskolnikov without the guilt.

Unlike Dostoevsky's prototypical anti-hero, however, Balram's crime is founded on a morality and world view we can actually root for (well, maybe that's my own morality and world view showing through. Still.) This novel is at once heart-wrenching, disgust-provoking and deeply satirical (also very, very funny). It seethes with anger and conveys well -- primarily through a scathing irony -- the injustice that has so rightfully led to the anger in a way that every slave narrative should. For this is how I would characterize it: this is a book about the economic and social structures that enslave huge segments of the world's population and that demand, may even require, nothing short of human sacrifice to redress. Adiga's India rivals Rohinton Mistry's in A Fine Balance in terms of the horrific descriptions of the living conditions of the impoverished in India, but the character arc is in the opposite direction. Also, Adiga goes further in making his book entirely about what it actually takes for a rooster to escape the coop, or the tiger to escape the cage (I enjoyed the humans-as-beasts symbolism, which is powerful and prevalent, used to illustrate the effects of entrapment and servitude from a number of perspectives). Where A Fine Balance achieved its thematic goal by leaving the reader feeling oppressed and hopeless, The White Tiger achieves a very similar goal by leaving us enraged and discomfited. There is more hope here, I think, but it is a bleak sense of optimism founded upon a reality so gritty, and a protagonist so flawed, that it might better be described as numbed collusion. Progress is inevitable, but so is the corruption that lies at the heart of it. In A Fine Balance, we were worn down and broken by the injustice portrayed; here we are co-opted and made complicit in it. The White Tiger has an immediacy and sense of modernity that A Fine Balance lacks, although the latter precedes it by just 15 years. The high-tech entrepreneurialism upon which Balram's success is founded is also India's and marks the difference between the stage of industrialization at the heart of each novel. AWT's contemporary globalism is reinforced through the highly effective framing device of Balram's seven-day (are we meant to draw a biblical parallel?) letter to the visiting Chinese Premier, which provides an up-to-the-minute context for the politics and economics. At the risk of taking the comparison too far, I was able to put A Fine Balance down and retain some sense of distance from its sadness, desperation and filth -- it was describing, after all, caste-on-caste subjugation. Shameful as this is to admit, I felt one step removed. It remained a story about a place I've never been, and one that didn't seem to influence my life. As I sit here typing a book review to be distributed over the Internet on my Dell computer using Microsoft software, for which I've occasionally needed to call a 1-800 number for service (all of these companies, among others, are identified by name in AWT), that distance has evaporated along with my sense of comfort and complacency. Ashiga, educated at Columbia and Oxford and living now in Mumbai according to the jacket blurb, offers a controlled but relentless satire that lets no one off the hook: not any of his characters, nor any of his readers no matter what part of the globe you call home. An extraordinary read, highly recommended. ...more I went through a manic phase of reading e-books because I was given a Kindle.

Now stop looking at me with all your judging faces. The book itself is made out of really good quality crisp paper. Not the bog-roll tracing paper kind of paper, but a good thick slice of squished tree with a nice font. Do I now hate my kindle for its paper free magic? No, but there is just something about a nicely presented book. You all know what I mean. This book has languished on my shelf for a long time (since 2009 to be precise) and despite its visual appeal, I tried several times to make it beyond the first two pages and then failed miserably and put it back on the shelf. Today I was determined and I made it through in one sitting, with intermittent glances over the top of the pages to watch Game of Thrones. A one-sitting read might normally denote a book of some literary splendour. A compelling piece of finely crafted wordsmithing that had me glued to my seat. Truth be told, I'm on crutches at the moment and can't get about too well, so sitting is about all I am good for. The White Tiger is well written (but not necessarily in a way that would get me excited or see me hobble outside singing its praises like a demented Tiny Tim) but I carried on reading, only to find out who Balram murdered and why. In the end the motive was money, which is not shocking given that Balram is motivated by the acquisition of money and social betterment, although in places he likes to give you the impression he is above it all. Given his upbringing and the society he is exposed to in his village and in Delhi, the turn of events is not surprising. Balram wants to be a self-made man but it is a long climb up the social ladder from floor sweeper and tea maker, even when you've made it as far as low-rent chauffeur there is still quite a hike ahead. So, in the most directly entrepreneurial way possible Balram beats his boss to death (he's a corrupt man, but not unkind) and high-tails it with a bag of cold hard cash which is then used to set up his own successful business. All of this is done to the possible detriment of his family (who stand to be murdered as a result of his actions), a fact which Balram is keenly aware of, but it doesn't stop him. Why he chooses to out himself in epistolary form, as a murderer to a politician from another country, is not entirely clear but I suppose it is a novel conveyance for a plot line. Baffling but novel. I liked the cover more than the filling and at least one of the stars in the rating goes towards the books presentation and not the content. Man Booker said that this White Tiger roars. I say more like miaow. ...more I will start this short review with two equally little confessions. First, I know next to nothing about India, and second, when I picked this book up I was under the very mistaken impression that it was an urban-fantasy book. Luckily my ignorance of the setting was not so great as to have kept me under this impression past the first chapter or so, otherwise I'm sure I would have been pretty disappointed in the gritty realism (I think it's realism) of the story.

First, I know next to nothing about India, and second, when I picked this book up I was under the very mistaken impression that it was an urban-fantasy book. Luckily my ignorance of the setting was not so great as to have kept me under this impression past the first chapter or so, otherwise I'm sure I would have been pretty disappointed in the gritty realism (I think it's realism) of the story. There is no supernatural here. From what I have heard, some parts may be exaggerated and others skimmed over, but this is as much a social commentary on India (and the rest of the world, really) as it is a tale of an \"entrepreneurial\" underdog. I don't have any particular love for unlikeable characters. That may seem a null and void statement, but judging by the number of much-adored books with detestable main characters - both intentional ( The Catcher in the Rye ) and unintentional ( Twilight ) - it's a fairly valid comment. However I found this book to have one of those rare cases: the likeable unlikeable character. Balram is pretty awful a lot of the time. He's either weak and pathetic (yes, I am aware that this is hugely due to social conditioning) or selfish, vulgar and even cruel. The circumstances of his life account for much of it, but not all. He also has enough redeeming features to make him actually worth caring about, in the end - hence the \"likeable-unlikeable\" quality. I found the style of writing engrossing, as much as the story itself, and even though we are told the outcome of the plot pretty much at the very beginning, I still could not put it down in desperation to know what would happen. The imagery is evocative, though again my ignorance of the culture means I have no idea of the depth of realism in this. It certainly isn't an uplifting story. Yes, there is murder - this really isn't a spoiler, it even says so on in the cover blurb - (view spoiler) [ \"Blurb\" - good word that. Blurb . (I may have been watching too much Miranda... But I digress.) (hide spoiler) ] but there is also extreme poverty, cruelty, evocative descriptions of third-world living conditions that may not appeal to certain readers (I am aware of how wrong the word \"appeal\" is in this context). But it does, I think, what it sets out to do: entertain while provoking serious thought. Highly recommended. ...more A powerful novel that depicts some unique realities of the culture in India today.

Why would a book like this win any award whatsoever? Sigh... Aravind Adiga claims Ralph Ellison 's Invisible Man as the forebear of his Booker Prize Winning novel The White Tiger . I wish I could speak to that relationship (I really must get around to reading Ellison), but there was another relationship I found that was important to me: Balram Halwai (aka \"The White Tiger,\" aka \"Munna,\" aka \"Country-Mouse,\" aka Ashok Sharma) and Dostoevsky 's Raskolnikov. Balram is a sort of anti-Raskolnikov. Their story is much the same but there is one key difference: Balra Aravind Adiga claims Ralph Ellison 's Invisible Man as the forebear of his Booker Prize Winning novel The White Tiger . I wish I could speak to that relationship (I really must get around to reading Ellison), but there was another relationship I found that was important to me: Balram Halwai (aka \"The White Tiger,\" aka \"Munna,\" aka \"Country-Mouse,\" aka Ashok Sharma) and Dostoevsky 's Raskolnikov. Balram is a sort of anti-Raskolnikov. Their story is much the same but there is one key difference: Balram doesn't let \"foolish\" guilt overwhelm him. The fiery Indian man has a strength of spirit that the paranoid Russian lacks, and it makes him likable in spite of his actions. But then, Raskolnikov's weakness always made me cringe. His act of murder was nasty, yes, but it wasn't without justification, and once he committed the murder I wanted him to live up to the ideals he used to justify his act. He failed himself and paid the price, and he disappointed me in the bargain. Balram doesn't fall prey to the same weakness (although it is interesting to note that the novel is epistolary , unfolding in a series of letters over seven nights, so perhaps there is an underlying weakness that still catches him out beyond the confines of the novel), and he uses the murder and the money he steals to better his life and finally feel like \"a man\" in a world where caste enslaves more than half of its starving population. If Raskolnikov's crimes were somewhat justified, Balram's are much more so, but they also have greater consequences. Balram's crimes bleed into areas that Raskolnikov's don't. Balram's attack with the jagged neck of a Johnny Walker Black bottle doesn't just kill his \"master,\" it effectively kills his entire family. The wonder of Adiga 's book, however, is that it leaves us, or at least it left me, entirely okay with Balram's actions. The man did what he had to do. He did what the rich do everyday. And he became one of them. He rose up. He made it. And that's the American Dream isn't it? The American dream in Bangalor. Praise be to free enterprise. ...more Told in the form of a lengthy letter relating the protagonist's childhood, career, and - ultimately - his crimes, this is a dark, unsettling novel that also acts as an unflattering portrait of modern-day India.

Our unreliable narrator and anti-hero is Balram Halwai, a dubious 'entrepreneur' residing in Bangalore. For reasons never really explained, he is writing a confessional document, addressed to a Chinese politician, telling the story of his life. Over the course of seven nights he describes his poor upbringing, how he came to be employed as a driver to his landlord's son, his subsequent escape from the 'Darkness' of his youth to Delhi, and the final, terrible action culminating in his escape to Bangalore, and his freedom from servitude. The White Tiger is a page-turner - it only took me about a day to finish it. It reminded me a little of a recent read, A Kind of Intimacy by Jenn Ashworth; also a disturbing tale with a dishonest and emotionally corrupt narrator. When writing my review of that book, I mentioned that I felt Ashworth revealed the truth of her protagonist's nature too early in the story, and Adiga does the same thing here, giving away the climactic event of Balram's life within the first couple of chapters. Unfortunately, the narrative that comes after this makes no effort to draw you into Balram's world or encourage sympathy for his actions (nor whatever led him to them). This is in stark contrast with Ashworth's book, in which you can't help but feel sorry for the delusional, lonely Annie. Balram is almost definitely lonely, and may well be delusional too, but there's no attempt to humanise him. As you probably know, since I mention it every couple of reviews or so, I love unreliable narrators - even more so if they're isolated from society and lacking in ordinary morals - but Balram's tale is too bleak and, in the end, too pointless to be genuinely memorable. The novel is effective in its unflinching portrayal of India - the poverty of Balram's childhood village, the corruption that infects political systems in both the country and the city, the contempt masters have for their servants, the chaos of the city streets and how this clashes (in what appears to be an almost mocking fashion) with the intrusion of American tourists and glossy new corporate buildings. Whether accurate or not, it's certainly attention-grabbing and thought-provoking. There's also an inevitable undercurrent of dark, sly humour which adds to the compelling feel of the narrative. There are so many interesting ideas in this book, and the premise is, or at least could have been, fascinating. However, for me, the whole was a disappointment. It's perhaps most notable for its commentary on India and its depiction of the relationship between master and servant, but the device of Balram's confession falls somewhat flat, mainly due to the characterisation. Balram is, in a sense, the only character - the views we get of the others are very, very limited - so it's vital that the reader engages with him, yet this is almost impossible. Worth reading, if only because it's a quick read, but not a book I can say I truly enjoyed. ...more \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0645\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0647 \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u062c\u0645\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 (\u0645\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0649) \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0645\u0641\u064a\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0647 \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0645\u0634\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0649 \u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0631\u063a\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u063a\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0633\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u062a\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0646\u062e\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0648\u062a\u0633\u064a\u0637\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 When you are reading a book on Africa, what do you expect to read?

Mr. Bhagat created a product for the Indian masses whereas Adiga\u2019s product was directed towards Western award committee. I am not upset only because of what these two books have to offer (of course I have read worse books), but because what these two authors have given thousands of Indians that none of the celebrated Indian authors managed to provide for many many years. HOPE. Yes, the success of these two books have given hope to those thousands of Indians whose ideas, writings, stories never saw day light or just managed to find themselves in blogs that no one reads or publishers' bins. Now, you will see more and more books of similar themes on the streets. \"Indian Writings\" section of bookstores will become much bigger, alas just with rubbish content.
