Then baffled, irritated, and finally dismissive. Other Good Reads reviewers express the desire to like this book, but proceed to be confused, bored, and insecure. Most wrap up with the dismal feeling that they didn\u2019t GET it, and so didn\u2019t succeed in really liking it. I felt the same, but in addition was supremely annoyed and turned off by it. I\u2019m not so good at post-modern fiction to begin with, but I decided to leave my bias at the door because I had heard such great things about this author, and Pamuk didn\u2019t seem like a bogus poser from what I\u2019d read. The story is about an expatriate Turkish poet named Ka who leads a solitary and arid life in Frankfurt and travels to a remote village in his homeland, ostensibly to investigate a spate of suicides by religious Muslim women protesting the injunction to remove their head scarves at school. He is really there to kindle a romance with a recently divorced woman he knew at university. The novel unfolds over three days when the snow has cut off the town from the outside world. What transpires is a coup led by a dysfunctional theater troupe, a lot of political intrigue, and much ball batting between secular and religious townspeople. Pamuk gives equal billing to every opinion, although they do not differ much in terms of their reductive, inflamed and binary natures, or in ability to capture my interest or sustained attention. This is in large part because the protagonist Ka is stunted,childish and infuriating himself, and the writing is both busy and detached. The political intrigue and opinions in <+++>Snow</+++> are not interesting or illuminating, as they do not emanate from fleshed-out people, but cardboard cut-outs spouting giant, densely packed and tedious word bubbles. Inspiration strikes Ka while in Kars, and he stops to transcribe a series of nineteen poems, whenever they descend on him in perfectly realized form. Conveniently they get lost, but a conversation about them between Ka and his paramour goes like this: \u201cIs it beautiful?\u201d he asked her a few moments later. \u201cYes, it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d said Ipek. Ka read a few more lines aloud and then asked her again, \u201cIs it beautiful?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Ipek replied. When he finished reading the poem, he asked, \u201cSo what was it that made it beautiful?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ipek replied, \u201cbut I did find it beautiful.\u201d \u201cDid Muhtar [her ex] ever read you a poem like this?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d she said. Ka began to read the poem aloud again, this time with growing force, but he still stopped at all the same places to ask, \u201cIs it beautiful?\u201d He also stopped at a few new places to say, \u201cIt really is very beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s very beautiful!\u201d Ipek replied. To my mind, only a child under ten should ever be indulged in this sort of megalomania, and then only by his mother, but Ka is nowhere punished, ridiculed or even chided for his insufferable personality, and in fact I think we are supposed to admire him as embodying the innocence, purity, pathos and single-mindedness that come with being a true artist. Margaret Atwood says, in the New York Times Book Review \u201cNot only an engrossing feat of tale-spinning, but essential reading for our times. [Pamuk is] narrating his country into being.\u201d This seems to me the best case for why <+++>Snow</+++> won the Nobel Prize. The book makes Turkey legible, as well as digestible, to the West. The novel is chock a block with allusions to white western male institutions \u2013 Kafka, Coleridge, Mann, Nabokov (<---B>he wrote a lot of stuff in the west, anyway</---B>): an annoying and intrusive narrator, a novelist named Orhan, whose games of peek-a-boo get harder and harder to humor, an abysmal, abyssal usage of literary envelopes, a morose and misunderstood genius of a hero who falls desparately in love with a woman he obstinately refuses to lend more than one dimension \u2013 the sex scenes, incidentally, are some of the most unintentionally off-putting I have ever read, and recall the experience almost every woman has been unfortunate to undergo at least once, where she feels she might leave the room, go get some cheesecake and stand in the door frame watching her partner rythmically brutalizing a stack of pillows in laughable ignorance of her whereabouts or even existence. Afterwards our hero has the witlessness to add to the injury by calling this essentially masturbatory act \u201clove-making\u201d. In fact, this pretty much sums up my response to the whole book. ...more Nine Reasons I (strongly) disliked this book: 1. The author made himself a character in his story. I just don't like that.

Things happen to the main character without foreshadowing. The exposition that did come was mainly philosophical and seemingly tangential. And if I have to read another sentence about whether a Muslim woman should wear a scarf or not or how beautiful and terrifying snow can be, I will go batty. 6. I did not understand the motivations behind most of the characters' actions. This may be because I'm ignorant to the social intricacies of the Turkish realm. But this book did not help me to care. 7. As a fellow poet, I hated that the main character wrote 19 poems throughout the novel, but the reader never got to read any of them. This point is explained in the story, but it still bugged me. 8. The author inexplicably tried his hardest to make the novel seem like a biography even though A NOVEL is featured prominently on the cover. 9. From this novel I am to presume that every Turkish woman is profoundly beautiful and that Turkish men can only drag themselves after these creatures in the hope of being noticed. Bonus reason: two years later I'm still angry I read this book! ...more (view spoiler) [ In a lot of ways, Snow isn't much different from some of Pamuk's other novels--Ka wanders around Kars just as Galip wanders around Istanbul in The Black Book, and Ka's vacillation between acute perception of others and paralytic insecurities about himself is straight from Black in My Name is Red.

It's almost as though Pamuk keeps writing the same novel over and over--a novel about how men define themselves, particularly those men who discover they no longer seem to fit into the very physical space they occupy; in this case, Ka can't decide if he can still be Turkish after living in Germany for so many years. It isn't a question that the book ends up answering, either. Ka returns to Turkey only to discover that writing doesn't make it any easier to deal with the decisions he finds himself making throughout his stay in Kars: does he believe in God or not? Does he love Ipek or not? Should he stay in Turkey or not? Does he support Westernization or not? It would be easy to reduce this novel to a story in which East meets West through the figure of Ka, but the novel seems to be much more interested not in that intersection, but in what occurs when one tries to write about that intersection. In fact, this is a novel made up entirely of all kinds of writing--newspaper articles, play productions, poems, speeches, video recordings, and Ka's notes. All these are filtered through the narrator, who is attempting to locate \"Ka\" in those very documents--as though if one could simply find the green notebook, or discover the meaning of the snowflake diagram then one could concretely define Ka's identity. The end result is a rather nasty joke--<---A>Orhan Pamuk</---A> the narrator spends ages collecting all the bits of paper that comprise the life of Ka and then spends even more time piecing it all together, only to come up with not much: Ka is not a terribly interesting person. He's a washed-up poet and a crappy lover. The intense focus on identity leads only to a dead end in which Ka cannot be recovered through writing, just as the events in Kars cannot be explained or understood through the novel. Ka's motivations, his misogyny, and his indifference to others generally go unremarked by the narrator, causing the reader to wonder where, exactly, the narrator's fascination with Ka comes from. It is, of course, an ironic fascination--in becoming so wrapped up in Ka and Ka's actions, the narrator has failed to understand the underlying problems in the system and in the coup: there is no \"right\" side in this novel--the secularists, the Kurdish Nationalists, the Islamic fundamentalists, the Westernized Turkish exiles, the ex-Communists are all simply passing around the same system of power. It is a system (and one that Ka participates in throughout the novel) in which women become icons for men, just as Ipek is an icon for Ka. As a result, the initial story that brings Ka to Kars--the suicide girls--drops out of the narrative until even Kadife becomes fed up with it. This story fizzles out as Kadife neatly sums it all up: \"I'm sick of hearing men talking about why suicide girls commit suicide.\" It is this story--this initial narrative that Ka sympathizes with but does not apply in his own life--that provides the keys to the other stories of isolation, social pressure, and political coercion. But the suicide girls end up forgotten in this book as the men talk about them to the point of rendering those women only stories. I like Pamuk's novels, but I find them very difficult to read. They are slow, philosophical, and the main character is often so contradictory as to be slippery. This novel doesn't have the same type of experimental structure as My Name is Red--the narrative framework is more subtle. But I think that given the focus on writing (Ka cannot discover himself through his poems, Orhan Pamuk cannot discover Ka through the novel, and no one can figure out the suicide girls), identity and politics, this strategy is better.

I disagree. The book starts out fine, but it devolves into this really odd stream-of-consciousness craziness that feels like a fever dream and makes little sense of events at the end. In addition, the narrator keeps telling you what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 big stuff, like deaths, etc. \u2013 and if it was supposed to focus me and keep me from being distracted wondering what was going to happen, it did the exact opposite. I ended up skimming the last third because I was so annoyed with how all plot tension was gone, the protagonist was quickly becoming a snivelly annoyance, and \u2013 here\u2019s my main beef \u2013 no poems. Ka\u2019s whole character hinges on the fact that he\u2019s been blocked for all his years in the West, and when he comes \u201chome\u201d he has this rush of nineteen poems that just flow out of him. A great deal of time is spent talking about them and dissecting them, but because the green notebook he wrote them in is never found, we never get to actually read them. I find this to be a cheap, lame, cheater literary trick that shirks responsibility. The plot structure even would have allowed at least one poem to be printed, but why couldn\u2019t Pamuk have done even that? The one thing that struck me was listening to characters wrestle with the idea of God and His relationship to life, and even that was presented as either fanaticism or a mind-salve for miserable people \u2013 nothing joyful or life-affirming. ...more I read a few sample pages of Snow in the bookstore, drawn by its blurry, snowy cover; drawn by a recent New York Times review; drawn by its non-westernized roots in Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk; drawn, too, by curiosity at this recent Nobel Prize winner for literature.

If this were the beginning of a poem, he would have called the thing he felt inside him the silence of snow...\" Snow never stops falling throughout this lengthy novel, and indeed becomes a barometer of the human condition. \"Snow\" is also the title of a poetry collection the Turkish poet, Ka, writes over its time span. A diagram of a snowflake is his diagram of his core self, with branches into imagination, reason and memory. As snow gathers over the events of the story, it becomes at times a blizzard, at other times a gentle white blanketing over a trampled earth. Ka is traveling to the city of Kars to write an article about an epidemic of suicides among young Turkish women. As the force of westernization has entered the predominantly Muslim city, these young women have been \"freed\" to discard their head scarves. Their religious beliefs, however, are such that to bare their heads in public is more than they can bear--they would rather die. While investigating the suicides, Ka meets recently divorced Ipek, and he is instantly enthralled. The ensuing story is as much one of political rebellion as it is love story, complete with executions, betrayals, love found and love lost, and mysteries never quite solved. I've grown up on European literature, with its dense and intricate plotlines, stories with no particular rush to reach conclusion and no linear path in getting there, in contrast to the fast-paced western literature with spare plotlines, quick action, and neatly wrapped-up endings. Of course, there are exceptions, but when I am in the mood to sink deep into a multi-layered tome, I choose non-western literature, and when I want a quick tap-dance of literary skill, I choose American literature. Each has its own pleasures. Snow is no exception. I enjoyed this blizzard, even if at times I lost sight of the path for all the white stuff. Even the love story reminded me of the difference in the expression of love in different cultures, with Ka's falling into something nearing a worshipful obsession, immersing himself whole into the object of his affection--while a westernized love story would be more geared toward seduction and conquest, less about the dance of courtship and romance. There is surrender to the heart with nothing left in reserve in non-western literature that fascinates me. Do or die. Love or leave. For this reason alone, I enjoy reading literature by a variety of international authors; each provides a view into a varied perspective and life sense. In any culture, however, the human heart breaks for the same reasons. We read of Ka's devastation at learning his beloved has betrayed him with another--from this heartbreak is seeded a suspicion of murder (did Ka or didn't he?). The scene of confrontation between Ka and Ipek is perhaps the novel's most moving: hearts are shattered even as they continue to find comfort in each other's arms, a fatal mix of love threaded with hatred, and finally released by the chill of apathy. Pamuk writes of the complexities of love as far more baffling than reason alone might explain, and each time as unique as a snowflake. Snow is not a quick read. Nor is it an easy one. Like Ka's love, it requires immersion and a certain degree of surrender. It is a skilled and often marvelous novel, even if I am not convinced it is worthy of the Nobel. I would say not. Yet it is worth the effort to move through this snowfall, if only for the occasional moment of sheer literary mastery. ...more I have to say, it's been a while since I liked a novel as much as this one and it's been even longer that I've had the chance to lie on a beach and read for a week, so I will say that you may want to take this re view with a grain of sand .

But if what makes a novel a novel is the creation of a world, what makes a novel good is the creation of a tone, a space, a way of seeing the world that reaches outside and it is this quality which I really loved. It's hard to describe, and I think the Russians do it best, Gogol in particular, but Pamuk constantly maintains a funny sadness that is neither light nor depressing. I am sure there is a word for this in some language, but it is complete and it made me forget that I was reading at many points. However, it is also distinct enough that I can see how not everyone would love it. You have to read for the humor, indulge the poetry (this is not a veiled language reference, I mean the actual poetry in the text) and take the characters just seriously enough to care but not to mourn. So maybe, just to indulge my english teacher self once more, what makes a novel great is also this quality--it must be singular enough to be disliked and good enough to love. ...more Say you pay 100 dollars for good seats at a show.

Bad enough you'd die of alcohol poisoning drinking the weakest alcohol if you drank every time you saw the word snow in this book but I am at a part where an extremist takes a gun to a principal and goes on and on about head scarves and how girls wearing headscarves will keep them from being raped or harass. He goes on about how headscarves help a man respect a woman. But you should respect women as people in the first place and NOT rape or harass them whether they're in a bikini or naked or covered from head to toe! Men are not evil rape beasts who have to harass every woman they see unless she covers her hair. UGH! I despise this book! Another thing that sucks about this book is it's a sausage fest. It's like all the interesting stuff about these young girls gets pushed aside and no one cares about them. The rest of the women and girls in this are just props or love interests to obsess over.

His instinct is that this journey will change his life. Once back in Turkey, when he needs a reason to stay on, he tells people he is a journalist doing a story on the \u201cheadscarves suicides.\u201d A number of young women have committed suicide in Kars. Depending on folks\u2019 political perspective, they killed themselves because they were devout Moslems banned from wearing headscarves in public; or because of their dire poverty; or because they were forced by their families to marry old men; or because they faced lives of virtual slavery to abusive men -- bearing children, cooking and scrubbing. A good part of the story centers on the production and delivery of a play about headscarves. They state-sponsored play comes across as reminiscent of the type of thing put on in Mao\u2019s China that everyone had to attend. Kars, where the novel is set, is a real city in the northeast corner of Turkey, near Georgia, and Armenia and not far from the Caucasus Mountains and Russia -- thus the severe winter weather of the title. Its nearness to many borders has also given it a complex ethnic and political history, with Greeks, Georgians, Kurds and Persians in its past and present. Abandoned Russian and Armenian mansions and other buildings figure in the story. One theme is that the city is \u201cdown and out,\u201d destitute really, by-passed by the modern economy. It seems like twenty times the narrator walks the snow-filed streets and tells us he looks in on the teahouses filled with unemployed men smoking themselves to death. During his visit, a week-long snowstorm paralyzes the city. In fact the snow receives so much emphasis that it make it almost what I like to call an environmental novel (like The Shipping News) where the environment is almost a character in the novel. So the narrator is a small-time poet. (Are there any big-time poets left?) He\u2019s hit a dry spell but his muse strikes in Kars and he writes a series of poems, or, we are told, \u201cthey write themselves\u201d through his hands in a trance-like state. But he\u2019s very analytical for a poet \u2013 we\u2019re shown a geometric diagram he creates to show the relationships among his poems. He\u2019s also obsessed with examining his level of happiness, deliberately trying to improve his happiness, and we all know where that leads. There\u2019s a lot of political intrigue. Turkey is struggling to remain a Moslem, yet secular state. There is a lot of police tyranny and censorship. The prisons offer equal opportunity confinement and torture for Kurds, communists, and Islamic fundamentalists. \u201c\u2026three days, that\u2019s all it takes, three days and they\u2019re dead: gone, shot, forgotten.\u201d We are told fairly early in the story that the poet was assassinated after his return to Germany and that any number of groups could have been responsible. The narrator makes a point of telling us about his beliefs in a geometry of opposites. We see this several times: his old flame has a sister; one sister is very modern and one a fundamentalist. We have atheists and religious fanatics. We are told that old Marxists and communists make good religious zealots when they convert. Two fundamentalist religious boys are \u201chalves\u201d of each other and when one is shot by the army, the other feels that part of the murdered youth has been reincarnated in him (the living youth). The poet\u2019s biographer who narrates parts of the story after the poet is assassinated says that at times he feels he is becoming the now-dead poet. One intriguing theme discussed a couple of times; Are strongly-held religious and political beliefs a luxury for the rich? Or are they the only consolation available to the poor? The blurbs are right in telling us this is a very political novel. It\u2019s dense with themes, and overly long (it could be cut by a third) but still a good read. ...more The expatriate poet Ka returns to his native Turkey ostensibly to investigate a growing number of suicides among \"head scarf girls\" for an article in a German newspaper, but actually to reconnect with the beautiful divorcee Ipek whom he knew in college.

There are a few phrases that I believe directly explain both the reasons for this novel's existence and why it is written the way it is: \"A writer is someone who spends years patiently trying to discover the second being inside him, and the world that makes him who he is... ...I write because I am afraid of being forgotten. I write because I like the glory and interest that writing brings. I write to be alone. Perhaps I write because I hope to understand why I am so very, very angry at all of you, so very, very angry at everyone...\" Orhan Pamuk's Snow puts one of his \"second beings\" on display in this novel, the questing, lonely poet Ka, whose story drives the action. But we are not allowed a reliable narrator, in any sense of the word. Ka himself is a wandering man in search of who he is, a man who changes his mind and opinions every moment, who is on a journey of becoming, not being. And more than that, we are getting his thoughts through the filter of the author of the novel, who calls himself, \"Orhan Bey\" a \"friend of Ka's,\" and who is reconstructing this brief period in Ka's life for his novel. As he makes clear to us again and again, he can only guess at certain parts of Ka's experiences- even when we cannot see the author's voice at all, we know that he is creating this supposedly non-fictional man out of his own thoughts, dreams, memories and experiences as much as he is reconstructing events from hard evidence. And so, in a more straightforward, less mystical way, Pamuk continues the exploration into the loss of geniune voice and identity that he captured so well in My Name is Red . But here, he brings it out of a metaphysical, inner world, and out into the every day, mundane open. Although some readers may find this device somewhat ham handed (or downright annoying) and perhaps a breaking of the \"show, don't tell,\" rule, I would argue that Pamuk's device is consistent with his existing body of work and is very effective at conveying the experience he is trying to write about here. Would one prefer to relax into the story? Sure. Is anyone here really allowed to? No. The reader gets the same experience that the characters in the novel do. He depicts his poet Ka on a visit to Kars, a remote, decaying town (that once used to be a great provincial center) far from the cosmopolitan center of Istanbul- a symbol of Turkey's place in a Western/Euro-centric 20th and 21st century. He arrives in this town in the dead of winter, just as a large snowstorm is gathering, a storm that effectively traps him in the city until the roads open days later. This novel is the story of those few days in a community sealed off from the world. The snow means many different things to different people, and we see how that plays out over the course of these days- with results that largely end up more or less disastrous for all sides. Ka himself was purportedly drawn to the city to write an article about the \"suicide girls,\"- a high number of local women and girls who had committed suicide in a very short period of time, a story that had gotten some play in Istanbul and Germany. Though his real motives have more to do with love, nostalgia and the reclaiming of a lost past (again, a pretty direct symbol of Turkey), Ka nonetheless finds himself named the \"poet from the West,\" and runs into the gamit of local opinion on politics and society- die hard Kemalists, ex-communists, socialists, Kurdish nationalists, spiritualists, feminists, Islamic extremists, etc. Orhan Pamuk makes no bones about this being a political novel, and makes sure to show us all the elements that Turkey has to deal with as a state- a state that, mind you, proclaims all of its residents \"Turks\" and does not officially recognize any other identity within its state. He ends up embroiled in the machinations of everyone who fights with or against everything they believe he stands for (ie, the West), and despite all his attempts to escape (he says over and over towards the end of the book that all he wants is to be happy and get out of Kars alive), he cannot escape what is happening to him. As usual, Pamuk deals with the problems of the East/West divide and his poor country that is caught in the middle. He has many characters beg only for some clarification of who they are and what they are- an explanation for why there are so many extremists in the area. At one point a young teenage Islamist says, \"Please God, help me preserve my purity, protect my mind from confusion,\" as a group of political activists of all stripes attempt to come up with some sort of statement to make to \"the West\". (The West may seem a strangely archaic term, out of the Cold War- but this book shows how relevant it still is for many people, long past its use as a military alliance. The countries who were used as proxies in that war haven't forgotten the reasons they were given for those wars happening to them.) He also deals more generally with the problems of being a person who exists \"on the periphery\"- ie, anyone who doesn't live in Europe or North America. He has one person very eloquently express this problem as he says: \"When they write poems or sing songs in the West, they speak for all humanity. They're human beings- but we're just Muslims. When we write something, it's just called ethnic poetry.\" Pamuk has his characters express over and over, in so many different ways, that all they want is to be human beings as well. Some people feel that that is best accomplished by trying to be as much \"like the Europeans\" as possible, some feel that it is best accomplished by being the opposite of everything they believe that is if only to carve out a separate identity that won't be subsumed (or \"be forgotten\", the fear that Pamuk expresses above) into the greater \"Western\" culture, some believe it is found in Islam, the religion that they believe their personhood is reduced to when viewed through outside eyes, etc etc. This is perhaps both the biggest and most painful part of the book. No one is allowed to do or say anything without it being representative of something else, without someone feeling that they are taking sides with them or against them. Everything someone does is \"for Europe\" or \"for Islam\" or \"for the Kurds\". People are told the reasons that they're doing things, or think the reasons that other people think they are doing things, before they examine their own reasons. Case in point in this novel is the women- the \"suicide girls\" and the \"head scarf girls\" and their leader, Kadife, sister of the woman our poet is in love with. Every choice these women make is discussed endlessly- one side decides for them that they did it because they were poor- and everything that comes with it. Another side decides they did it for \"honor\" and religion- whatever the creed they represent tells them that women are supposed to be motivated by, and unsurprisingly, the few women that we see depicted appear to be driven crazy by the experience, whether they buy into what they're being told or not. The one woman who doesn't seem to is Ipek, the woman that Ka is in love with. She is shown as being affected by every day things that we would see characters in a \"Western\" novel being affected by- her failure to have children, her husband's professional failures, her daddy issues, her competition with her sister, the perception that people have of her due to the way that she looks. Ka appears to be drawn to this for a number of reasons, but I think one of them is that he wants to be as outside the present as she seems to be, as detached from the ugly realities that seem to be destroying everyone else. It is a talk heavy book for this reason- everyone seems to believe something fiercely and feels the need to repeat it over and over again, and shout it over whatever other people feel. It's an atmosphere where it is a novelty to ask questions of the other side, and preconceptions are almost always voiced before asking for answers (\"I know as an atheist you must think about suicide all the time, but...\" ... who in the what now?). And I think underneath all this is the recognition that not only do these people not know if they really believe what they profess to, they usually don't know what it means, why they believe it, and you know what at the end of the day: what they believe doesn't really matter anyway. They're not important enough to matter- their identity has been totally devalued. And everyone, but everyone, knows it. It is a slow, meditative book, as you might expect from something called Snow . Expect long digressions into philosophy, spirituality, religion, politics, and long long legacies of inferiority complexes and hatreds (particularly of course, against the perceptions of Europeans and the West)- Pamuk's explanation about why everyone is \"so very very angry at everyone else.\" It has a plot, certainly, and one that can get your heart racing at very specific moments, but it will be followed by long walks in the night grasping at something that, as Pamuk put it in his Nobel Lecture, \"one never quite gets to.\" It is a surreal place, and it is meant to be- a city blanketed in snow far away from the rules of every day life. It can be a black comedy at times, in a very sick way- of course his characters don't even know it. They spend so much time and energy talking about how they don't want to look foolish in the eyes of foreigners, and yet the moments when some of them are the most sure are the ones that get the reader to pity them the most. Not that the book wants that either. He has his characters get a say in what they want said- no one knows what they want to say to the West, but in the end it seems to add up to the fact that they are not figments of our (and by our I mean readers in Westernized countries) imagination that can be categorized into things like poor people to help, depressed people to pity, extremists to fear or really just: Other. At one point the novelist has a conversation with a former teenage Islamist who says: \"But I can tell from your face that you want to tell the people who read your novels how poor we are and how different we are from them. I don't want you to put me in a novel like that.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you don't even know me, that's why! Even if you got to know me and described me as I am, your Western readers would be so caught up in pitying me for being poor that they wouldn't have a chance to see my life. For example, if you said I was writing an Islamist science-fiction novel, they'd just laugh. I don't want to be described as someone people smile at out of pity and compassion.\" Even as Pamuk gives us this slice of life in Turkey that he's deliberately shown us comes so close to reality, he reminds us again that we haven't seen the real thing and perhaps we never can see the \"real thing\" in each other, that our perceptions are doomed to be incomplete and fuzzy, covered in a blanket of snow. I would recommend to anyone reading this that you find a brief summary of Turkish politics before diving in- I don't think in depth knowledge is necessary, but I do think knowing what Kemalists are, what Article 301 did, what the role of the army is, and what happened in the 2002 elections are all essential for fully appreciating what this book is. Of course one can appreciate it solely on its artistic merits, but it is a political novel that is meant to address some gaping wounds in the country, and I think that it should be respected as such, or you'll miss out on a lot. Also, patience. Lots and lots of patience. It will pay off, though. You'll find out why everyone is so very angry in the end, and I believe that you'll find that that knowledge is very much worth the having. ...more Surah Al-Ahzaab, Verse #59 \u2018O Prophet!

Ka, or Kerim Alaku\u015fo\u011flu, a Turkish poet, returns to Kars, an old and small city north-east of Turkey. Kerim, a 42-year-ol Surah Al-Ahzaab, Verse #59 \u2018O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks veils all over their bodies that is most convenient that they should be known and not molested: and Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.\" Ka is travelling by bus: a white scenario outside unfolds: it\u2019s snow, relentlessly falling\u2026and he falls asleep. Ka, or Kerim Alaku\u015fo\u011flu, a Turkish poet, returns to Kars, an old and small city north-east of Turkey. Kerim, a 42-year-old unmarried man, has been for 12 years in Frankfurt, Germany. There, it\u2019s been four years he doesn\u2019t write poems. He took refuge in the library where he can find books enough for \u201ctwenty lifetimes\u201d.He especially likes Turgenev: the Russian writer. He doesn\u2019t bother much learning German: \u201cmy body resisted German language\u201d. But he meets with fellow Turks. Ka has only two fears in his life: fear of not being natural and fear of writing bad poems. He considers himself to be a political exile in Germany; a \u201ccorrect and sad\u201d man like the heroes of Chekhov; someone who likes solitude. Ka was condemned for an article he didn't write. Until the 1970\u2019s, people could write everything in Turkey: nobody went to jail; but, after the military coup, things got different;\u2026 so, he fled to Germany. Meanwhile his mother died, and he had to return to Istanbul. After that, he decides to go to Kars: while traveling by bus to the remote city he lies to someone who inquires him; Ka says he\u2019s going to Kars because he\u2019s a journalist and will report on local elections and the suicide-of-women problem. But he\u2019s going to Kars hoping to find beautiful \u0130pek, and to ask her to marry him. \u0130pek attended college with Kars. But then got married. Ka will stay for three days in Kars where 40 % of the population is Kurdish. While strolling around the city Ka notices cafes are filled with unemployed Kurds. It\u2019s a deserted-looking city; yet full of History: the Russian period (1877-1918)\u2026and the period when some Armenians were rich. You can still contemplate millenarian Armenian churches there. (above, the cathedral where once the \"talented\" Armenian child George Ivanovich Gurdjieff sung) There are billboards in Kars saying: \u201dThe Human Being is a masterpiece of God, suicide is an insult\u201d. They try to halt the suicide rate. In Kars, while talking to the local newspaper editor, Ka sees the snow keeps falling: an incredible amount outside. Purging snow? ...There\u2019s a cry for solitude \u2026everywhere. Why are women committing suicide in Kars? A suicide rate that is four times above world-average. Some say it all started in Batman village (a bastion of the Turkish Hezbollah): women are suicidal too. Explanations include premeditation\u2026.and women being manipulated. In Kars he meets \u0130pek Hanim; she\u2019s been divorced. She\u2019s the daughter of the hotel manager, where Ka is lodged at. They speak about mothers who died;\u2026while they talk at a caf\u00e9 a murder takes place just before them. It\u2019s a religious motivated homicide. One of the murderer\u2019s motives is rooted on the precept/question: should women cover head and face? * \u0130pek\u2019s father (Turgut Bei) is a communist. One of the candidates in the local elections is Muhtar Bei; he wants to re-marry \u0130pek. \u0130pek\u2019s sister is a militant of the Islamic veil. One day Ka talks to Muhtar at the party's office; Muhtar admires the snow show outside. Ka marvels at the grace and tranquilizing force of the snow; its silence gets him closer to God. ... People liked the Refah Party; it was the most voted in 1995; but in 1998 it was dissolved by decree by the generals\u2019 pressure. This is truly a political novel,\u2026and Ka who never got interested in politics,\u2026 (Ka so far buried in silence) is about to be dragged into it. Issues of Ka\u2019s time are Turkish issues today (still): freedom of the press, religion and the rule of Law. --- *13th February 2013,luckily,I guess,I bumped recently into this \"old\" (Wednesday February 16,2000) issue of the Financial Times; an article [Iran's Islamic feminists passionate about equality and the Koran] by Roula Khalaf,reporting on the \"female factor\" in elections in Iran .I quote:\"Fariba Dadayoudi-Mohajer says she prefers not to be called a feminist.Indeed her appearance and desmeanour suggest tradition and conservatism.Covered in a black chador -the all-enveloping robe-she pushes her headscarf closer to her face when a man enters the room.

There is no real character development. The women are beautiful (or fat), and one of the important, but minor, characters has blue eyes. That doesn't count as character development. My biggest objection, however, is content. There was frequent, hate-filled dialogue from political Islam constituting an attack on the West. To be fair, this did not come from the main character. In fact, he was usually the target of this hate speech as representing the atheistic west. I didn't know he was an atheist until told so, long after he realized that snow made him think of God. I found it unbelievable that right out of nowhere would an atheist think of God when he saw snow. This is on Boxall's 1001 Books You Should Read Before You Die. Opinions vary.

I read This is my fourth Pamuk novel and the more of his work i read, the more i want to read his work. The first one i read, i read in college: The White Castle . All i can remember is that i really liked it and it made me want to read Pamuk (i need to re-read it now). Then a few years out of college, i got My Name is Red and tried to read it. This was well before goodreads and i didn't have anyone to save me from frustration, so i stopped reading it thinking i'd take it up later at some point. I read it fairly recently with my Middle East/North Africa group here on goodreads and it turned out to be a tremendously rewarding experience. i shook my finger and scolded my younger self for having given up so easily. Especially because My Name is Red was not the only book casualty from that earlier experience. It made me wary of trying to read Snow , even though i knew it dealt with topics that interest me and in which i'm fairly well-read, not necessarily in the Turkish context, but i should not have been afraid. About a year ago i got The Museum of Innocence from the library. I'll be honest: it was hardbound with a plastic library protective sleeve, it was chunky, it had appealing cover art...i had to have it. I was a little cautious starting it, but it sucked me in. I loved it. Towards the end Pamuk ties the book to Snow and it was like an epiphany for me. I WILL BE SCARED NO MORE. And now i have read it, thanks to the Worlds Lit group moderator putting it on the schedule for the beginning of our exploration of Turkish literature. I still have to get caught up on the discussion in that group. Normally i participate in discussions at the same time i'm reading, but this book unfolds and unfolds and unfolds...i just wanted to experience it for myself without interference from others' reactions. Part of my reason for doing so is not so much a fear of spoilers, but Pamuk is an evocative writer and i wanted to just get lost in the mood he created for me. I think this is one of the things i most like about Pamuk now that i have embraced his work: He has a style. it may not be a unique style, but it is distinct. Yet each book is an individual with its very own atmosphere; you know you are absolutely reading a Pamuk novel but it doesn't feel like any other Pamuk novel (or any other novel for that matter) you have read. I wanted to get lost in that, and i did. I normally get annoyed and frustrated if i don't finish a book quickly enough. i read this for a much longer period than i had intended, but i don't regret it. His writing is somewhat meaty, but not at all difficult to chew if you let yourself just sink your teeth in. About the book itself--there are layers to this story and i'm not sure i have properly absorbed all of them. Also, there were some aspects that were odd to me and i'm still trying to get my finger on those, so i'm going to hold out on commenting on those for now. I still have to join the discussion and also, i think i just might be re-reading this someday. ...more Snow novel pemenang Hadiah Nobel (Kesusasteraan) 2006, Orhan Pamuk, diterjemahkan Maureen Freely, mengangkat kekeliruan manusia untuk mengakui kewujudan Tuhan dan mencari cinta sebenar di tengah-tengah pertembungan antara pemikiran Islam yang radikal dengan kebebasan idea Barat. Berlatarbelakangkan kota kecil di kawasan pergunungan, Kars yang tersisih di timur Anatolia, Turki, novel ini menampilkan Kerim Alakusoglu atau lebih dikenali sebagai Ka, penyair yang menjadi pelarian politik di Jerman se Snow novel pemenang Hadiah Nobel (Kesusasteraan) 2006, Orhan Pamuk, diterjemahkan Maureen Freely, mengangkat kekeliruan manusia untuk mengakui kewujudan Tuhan dan mencari cinta sebenar di tengah-tengah pertembungan antara pemikiran Islam yang radikal dengan kebebasan idea Barat. Berlatarbelakangkan kota kecil di kawasan pergunungan, Kars yang tersisih di timur Anatolia, Turki, novel ini menampilkan Kerim Alakusoglu atau lebih dikenali sebagai Ka, penyair yang menjadi pelarian politik di Jerman selama 12 tahun, kembali ke bumi kelahirannya itu untuk mengutip memori. Dengan alasan membuat laporan untuk akhbar di Istanbul mengenai tragedi bunuh diri di kalangan wanita bertudung yang menjadi wabak tidak terkawal dan pilihan raya tempatan, Ka cuba menyembunyikan hasrat sebenar kepulangannya untuk bertemu kembali dengan bekas rakan sekelasnya, Ipek. Salji tebal yang turun di kawasan pergunungan Kars bukan saja menimbulkan suasana nostalgia dan melankolik pada novel ini, bahkan menjadi sempadan kepada peristiwa penting dalam cerita ini, iaitu rampasan kuasa Kumpulan Teater Sunay Zaim yang mendokong fahaman sekular Atarturk. Ini kerana rampasan kuasa itu berlaku dalam tempoh Kars terputus hubungan daripada dunia luar akibat salji menutup jalan masuk ke kota berkenaan, sekali gus memberi suasana misteri kepada pelbagai isu seperti konflik Islam-sekular, pemakaian tudung, kemiskinan, bunuh diri dan campur tangan tentera. Rampasan kuasa ditandai dengan persembahan teater daripada naskhah klasik, My Fatherland or My Head Scarf, sekali gus menyalakan kekecohan di kalangan pelajar sekolah agama kerana ia memaparkan adegan pelakon wanita yang menanggalkan tudung, lalu membakarnya. Ia disusuli adegan meninggalkan kesan kepada pembaca apabila askar menyerbu ke pentas melepaskan tembakan peluru hidup ke arah penonton yang menyangka ia sebahagian pementasan teater sehingga berlaku pertumpahan darah, diikuti penangkapan beramai-ramai pelajar sekolah agama. Novel ini banyak mempertemukan Ka dengan pelbagai watak dengan ramuan keperibadian tersendiri seperti Blue sebagai pelampau berkarisma; Necip (pelajar yang idealistik dan bercita-cita menjadi penulis fiksyen sains dunia); Kadife (pemimpin wanita bertudung) dan Sunay (penggerak teater yang merampas kuasa). Menariknya novel ini menggunakan dua sudut pandangan, iaitu Ka yang menggerakkan plot utama Snow, manakala perspektif kedua dibayangi pengarang dengan menggunakan watak rakan baik Ka, Orhan yang menceritakan kisah Ka dalam bentuk laporan. Orhan seolah-olah membaca nota catatan Ka sepanjang berada di Kars itu, selain mempunyai misi untuk mendapatkan buku nota hijau yang mengandungi 19 puisi Ka ditulis ketika berada di kota berkenaan, tetapi hilang selepas kematiannya. Karya penerima Hadiah Nobel pada tahun lalu ini bagaikan mengesah kekeliruan yang melingkari dalam kehidupan masyarakat Turki yang merangkumi ketakutan tanpa asas pada Islam, kedegilan memelihara ideologi sekular ala Ataturk dan keghairahan untuk diterima oleh Eropah. ...more 2015 biterken ve 2016'n\u0131n ba\u015flar\u0131nda, \u00fcstelik Kars'a do\u011fru yola \u00e7\u0131kt\u0131\u011f\u0131mda okumaya ba\u015flad\u0131m.

Al di l\u00e0 del legittimo discorso sulla sicurezza pubblica, spuntano come funghi le considerazioni delle donne di turno, interpellate semplicemente in quanto appartenenti al genere femminile (e quindi, capaci di proferir verbo per l'intera categoria, secondo la logica del talk show), sul pericolo che il velo costituisce per la dignit\u00e0 della donna. Segue una sequela di banalit\u00e0 sulla necessit\u00e0 di essere donne, \"essere femmine\" (giuro, l'ho sentito) senza paura del maschio, e tutti quei discorsi che si fingono femministi perch\u00e9 anche il radical chic fa estremamente glamour (e quindi donna). Quello che si perde in questi dibattiti che cercano di approfondire un argomento importante riempiendolo di nulla \u00e8 il senso delle parole, che vengono usate come se avessero un significato univoco, marmoreo, voluto dal divino. Cosa \u00e8 la dignit\u00e0? Perch\u00e9 quella delle donne deve essere diversa da quella dell'uomo? E' cos\u00ec scontato che l'uso del velo ammazzi l'identit\u00e0 della donna? Se \u00e8 vero che in alcuni paesi, come l'Iran, le donne sono obbligate per legge a indossare il velo, \u00e8 anche vero che ovunque si trovano delle islamiche che decidono consapevolmente di usarlo pur senza imposizioni. Agiscono inconsciamente sotto l'influsso della propria cultura (o dell'uomo di casa) o vedono davvero nel velo una fonte di dignit\u00e0? E' difficile dare una risposta univoca, semplicemente perch\u00e9 non c'\u00e8. Che voi siate del partito dell'accavallamento della coscia come strumento di indipendenza femminile o che accettiate di porre un \"ma\" alla fine delle vostre convinzioni, questo libro vi stupir\u00e0. Perch\u00e9 \"Neve\" riesce a far vergognare di s\u00e9 anche l'occidentale pi\u00f9 aperto alle altre culture, quello che osserva ogni fatto straniero attraverso il filtro del relativismo culturale, credendosi imparziale. Pamuk \u00e8 pronto a mandarci in corto circuito, ponendoci davanti agli occhi un caso che gi\u00e0 di per s\u00e9 costituisce un mistero per l'occidentale di oggi: \u00e8 possibile che delle ragazze si uccidano perch\u00e9 viene loro vietato l'uso dello chador? Sembra impossibile, eppure accade questo a Kars, citt\u00e0 di confine tra la Turchia e l'Armenia in cui si svolge la vicenda. Il nostro chaperon personale \u00e8 Ka, poeta turco ed esule politico in Germania, che si reca a Kars per indagare sul caso delle giovani suicide. La Turchia \u00e8 una democrazia, pi\u00f9 o meno di facciata, dagli anni venti e il principio della laicit\u00e0 dello stato ha portato al bando di copricapi e abiti religiosi, anche se quelli femminili fino alla met\u00e0 degli anni ottanta costituivano un'eccezione. Sembra quindi logico, all'europeo e al turco che abbraccia i principi kemalisti (di Kemal Ataturk, padre della democrazia), che questo costituisca un traguardo importante per le donne, libere di mostrare finalmente le proprie forme. Noi, in quanto occidentali, e Ka, in quanto turco borghese cresciuto nell'occidentalissima Istanbul, non possiamo che condividere questo pensiero. Ma queste ragazze sono un macigno che blocca il meccanismo del nostro ragionamento. Per quanto continuiamo a oliare le nostre convinzioni, le suicide rimangono l\u00ec, incastrate tra gli ingranaggi, con la loro morte inspiegabile. L'unica giustificazione possibile \u00e8 l'arretratezza culturale in cui sguazzavano le ragazze, o la pressione della religione sulle loro teste. Perch\u00e9 \u00e8 per noi cos\u00ec difficile concepire un caso simile senza pensare che necessariamente esso dipenda dall'arretratezza culturale del paese in questione? Semplicemente perch\u00e9 Occidente e Oriente sono come due fiere che si guardano in cagnesco da lontano. Si sbirciano con gli occhi talmente socchiusi in una smorfia di disprezzo che nessuna delle due riesce a focalizzare le caratteristiche dell'altra, eccetto una, che passa a connotare l'intero soggetto in maniera assoluta. E cos\u00ec l'Occidente diventa per gli integralisti islamici un luogo in cui tutte le donne vogliono fare le attrici dalle natiche al vento, e l'Oriente islamico un convoglio di barbuti che opprimono le donne senza nemmeno porsi il problema se questo sia giusto. Sono cos\u00ec, \u00e8 la loro cultura. Poco importa che tra un estremo e l'altro ci sia il mondo. Non sono passata dall'uso del velo al rapporto tra Oriente e Occidente per dar aria alla bocca. Pamuk usa la questione del velo come punto di partenza per una corsa a due squadre, Occidentali contro Orientali, che al momento della pistolettata in aria sono divisi in due gruppi ben distinti dal colore della maglia, ma al traguardo la maglia non ce l'hanno pi\u00f9 e molti di loro non se ne accorgono neppure. Non certo perch\u00e9 siano cessate le ostilit\u00e0: al contrario, i partecipanti sono perennemente armati l'uno contro l'altro. Quello che cancella lentamente i confini tra le fazioni \u00e8 la ricerca della felicit\u00e0, motore che spinge tutti i personaggi alla propria condotta. Pamuk \u00e8 molto bravo a far emergere questo aspetto, perch\u00e9 il problema tra orientali e occidentali viene argomentato attraverso le parole dei personaggi, che intrecciano ideali e vita quotidiana, trascinandoci nostro malgrado nella loro esistenza, fatta di crisi spirituali, rimorsi, speranze. La verit\u00e0 non \u00e8 dettata da un autoritario fuoricampo, ma da questo insieme di voci dai timbri variopinti. Vi sorprenderete ad amare alla follia personaggi che per le loro convinzioni sareste forse portati a disprezzare, come il giovane integralista Necip, e ad odiarne altri che rappresentano la vostra stessa cultura. Ma Neve non \u00e8 solo questo. Se Pamuk vi indica l'uomo che c'\u00e8 dietro l'integralista islamico, sia esso uomo o donna, in un secondo momento vi porta a rivolgere contro di voi il vostro stesso indice. L'orientale non \u00e8 solo quello che rifiuta l'identit\u00e0 occidentale per salvaguardare la propria, \u00e8 anche quello che insegue l'Europa come i positivisti inseguivano la scienza. L'Occidente \u00e8 la strada per lo sviluppo, per la felicit\u00e0. Ka \u00e8 un personaggio emblematico da questo punto di vista: esiliato per motivi politici nei quali non crede nemmeno pi\u00f9, ateo per conformismo, si vergogna della miseria del suo popolo e soffoca con paura il suo desiderio di credere in un dio. Pur essendo un turco, va in giro con quel suo cappotto tedesco comprato ai magazzini Kaufhof di Francoforte come se fosse la sua seconda pelle, perch\u00e9 lo protegge \"dalle cattiverie\". La verit\u00e0 \u00e8 che gli d\u00e0 la sensazione di essere parte di un paese che non \u00e8 il suo e che lo rifiuta. Quando vive a Francoforte, Ka vive nella miseria pi\u00f9 profonda e nella solitudine pi\u00f9 nera, perch\u00e9 anche all'estero gli unici che si interessano di un turco sono i suoi connazionali. Pamuk porta in primo piano la tragedia del turco che compie un passo verso l'Europa rinnegando se stesso e trova il vuoto sotto i suoi piedi, ma non sa pi\u00f9 tornare indietro perch\u00e9 teme che significhi rimettersi sulla strada dell'arretratezza. In conclusione, Neve \u00e8 un romanzo che ha molto da dire. Non ha la faccia saccente di chi ti ammonisce per importi la sua verit\u00e0, sembra piuttosto che l'autore stesso abbia voluto recitare un mea culpa con il lettore occidentale, data la sua appartenenza alla classe borghese di Istanbul. Fra queste pagine c'\u00e8 la bellezza delle riflessioni sulla vita, sulla morte, del desiderio di felicit\u00e0 comune a uomini diametralmente opposti per le loro convinzioni, e della continua nevicata che non smette di ricordare agli uomini la loro unicit\u00e0 rispetto a tutti gli altri e la fragilit\u00e0 della loro esistenza. La neve \u00e8 il simbolo della bellezza del creato, della incerta presenza di un dio che ci ignora, della vita che ci lega gli uni agli altri nostro malgrado e ci costringe a rimanere stretti stretti sullo stesso pianeta, come in una piccola citt\u00e0 di confine chiusa in una palla di vetro. Una cosa \u00e8 certa. Alla fine del romanzo, le vostre convinzioni avranno ricevuto una bella limata. - Se mi mette in un romanzo ambientato a Kars, vorrei dire ai lettori di non credere assolutamente a ci\u00f2 che dice di me, di noi. Nessuno pu\u00f2 capirci da lontano. - Tanto nessuno crederebbe a un romanzo del genere. - No, ci crederebbero, - disse di getto. - Per considerare se stessi intelligenti, superiori e umani, vorranno credere che noi siamo ridicoli e simpatici, e che loro ci possono capire cos\u00ec come siamo, arrivando addirittura a provare affetto nei nostri confronti. Ma se mette questa mia frase, nelle loro menti si insinuerebbe un dubbio. ...more To have two abandoned books in one evening is not good. In fact this has never happened to me before.

In my opinion, there were words leaping all over the place without any meaning or substance. I arrived at the end and thought do I need to torment myself? No. So into the \"cloud\" it sailed. I see that Mr Pamuk was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006 and that he's \"one of the freshest, most original voices in contemporary fiction\". Well, we all have reading choice in life and that's my reasoning. ...more It took me almost 2 months to read this book because for many times, reading it is like a chore. However, there are some brilliant parts so I continued reading hoping that there were lots of them especially in the last 50 pages. I was not disappointed. The last parts really made sense and Pamuk made sure that the political message like Turkey is in search of its own identity as a nation is well-entrenched in the mind of his readers.

However, there are some brilliant parts so I continued reading hoping that there were lots of them especially in the last 50 pages. I was not disappointed. The last parts really made sense and Pamuk made sure that the political message like Turkey is in search of its own identity as a nation is well-entrenched in the mind of his readers. But what country is not in search of her identity? Even the Philippines has this dilemma. Or maybe it is just a matter of perspective. The story revolves around Ka the exile poet from Frankfurt who decided to go back to Turkey to investigate the reported suicide of young girls in his hometown, Kars. While there, his past relationship with a childhood sweetheart Ipek is rekindled. The problem is that Ipek has married and is now divorced but in love with another man, the rebel Blue who is also in relationship with Ipek's sister Kadife. This four-sided love story amidst the suicide, the assassinations, the coup by a disgruntled theater troupe. All of these amidst the heavy snow that at the first part is so vividly described that I felt like I am missing a lot by living in a tropical country. Then of course, there is Orhan Pamuk the character in the book that narrates the whole thing and that at some points in the novel is directly taking to his readers by explaining what's happening. He, towards the end, went to the place retracing the life of Ka. I absolutely liked that part as if the Ka's life story is about to begin again with Orhan Pamuk. Or Ka and Orhan Pamuk are one and the same person. Brilliant storytelling technique that I have not seen yet in the 300+ 1001-Books-You-Must-Read-Before-You-Die books that I've read so far. What I thought worked against my really liking about this book is the long and winding repetitive parts about taking the head scarves or not. I know this is a big deal for Muslim people but I just could not relate to that and shame, the problem is mine. I also thought that the theater scene is corny. Had that been turned into a Fall-of-Saigon kind of coup and killing that would have been more enjoyable. Overall, I still like this book. It made me understand Turkey as a country and I am happy to having tried (and finishing) an Orhan Pamuk's work. Maybe this is not his best. I have a friend who is raving about My Name is Red (tbr) so maybe I should read that one later this year. ...more This book is gorgeously written, hypnotic, and probably too long. Snow permeates the book, and Pamuk's descriptions have the effect we get from noticing that it is snowing slightly outside--we get a small, pleasurable jolt of surprise that pulls us away from the action briefly.

Of action there is much. The characters are trapped in the city of Kars, which serves as an effective external mechanism for putting pressure on them to act and interact. The book starts to get really interesting fairly early on, I'm going to say Chapter 5, when we switch from Ka's perspective to a recording of a man who we know prior to reading the chapter has died. We are privy, then, to their final conversation. This chapter is riveting, the dialogue that much starker because we know the end result. The plot thickens at various points in a manner reminiscent of Crime and Punishment , where the same characters keep crossing paths, intentionally or otherwise, and their conversations have the feel of something larger, representations of ideas and movements rather than only individuals' concerns. I have to admit the novel became challenging for me to follow at times, particularly without feeling on a visceral level exactly what was at stake in whether or not a Turkish woman chooses to wear a scarf or not. That is, while I can understand the intellectual debate that Pamuk is staging, it requires a bit of a leap of faith to feel its urgency, unlike Crime and Punishment , where the murder and the ensuing moral debates don't seem to depend on the same degree prior cultural background or knowledge. Or maybe they do, but in that case I have the prior knowledge. This book, while flawed, was nonetheless enjoyable for the bulk of the reading. There is a wonderful, lovely simplicity to the language, as if the very pages themselves are mirrors catching the snowflakes that flutter amidst nearly every scene. ...more This is going to be a rant, even more so because this book is written by Nobel Prize Winner, honored for how he represents Turkey in his books.

Where is the saving grace of this piece of junk trying to pass itself as a novel? Ka , the pompous main character is probably the vilest creation I've come across in a while. That's an achievement, given how much I dislike most protagonists. This idiot is an exile, who comes back to Turkey for his mother's funeral. Once that is done, he reveals his utter selfishness, and decides to travel to Kars. He has noble intentions - to write about some election that no one cares about and to examine the string of suicides among Karsian women. But his all-encompassing in-your-face obsession is Ipek, the beautiful woman who now lives in Kars, is single, and who Ka wants to marry without actually knowing her. Because you know, when your name is Ka, you think, \"I can never fall in love with a woman unless I know nothing about her.\" He then proceeds to do everything in his power to fuck her, oops sorry, to \"make love\" to her, for example, sending her old father off to a potentially dangerous meeting with a known terrorist who he knows is being monitored by the state. But, what can you do, he's in love. And he will be so happy with Ipek, he just knows this! When they do \"make love\", Ipek looks a bit too confident - not fragile enough for our hero - so he hurts her. She, being the idiot masturbation fantasy (for the author as much as the characters, he even admits it in the novel) that she is, enjoys the fuck out of it. From there the plot devolves into utter stupidity, surprising me as to the depths it could sink to, considering how low it was to begin with. It's definitely deeper than the \"true love\" referred to in this book. Pamuk introduces issues very early in the novel - covered girls, poverty, Islamist political movement, the craziness of the state, suicide . But these are just for show, and to build up to the 436 pages (in my edition) of the novel. Every time someone begins to talk about the issues, and gets in about two lines, the author cuts to Ka, who is daydreaming about the many ways he can fuck Ipek instead of following the conversation. If the main character does not think that any of these issues are interesting, why should I, the reader, care? In any case, Pamuk barely scratches the surface of the rich material available to him. For example, twice he paints himself into a corner pertaining to a covered girl's faith, and twice he uses the same out - I am not going to discuss my faith with an atheist! Pamuk cleverly does not write a theist who could drag this explanation out. As for the suicides, that's just a frame. No one bothers with it after Ka does some initial half-hearted investigation, apparently no girl decides to bother with suicide while he's there. Some investigative journalist he would make too - a more incurious literary journalist you'd be hard pressed to find. He just blows with the wind, and stops the would-be interesting plot routinely at least twice in a paragraph for the following reasons in any order: 1. How beautiful Ipek is! How much he loves her! How they'll be happy in Frankfurt! 2. How beautiful the snow is! I can hear the silence of God in it for the first 200 pages of the book! After that I'll conveniently forget that I had any dilemma about God. But, even then, the snow is so fucking beautiful! 3. Hold your military coup for a freaking minute! My brain is like an incontinent bladder and it's leaking a poem! Go boil your heads for ten minutes while I scribble this down! 4. Isn't my poem beautiful? Isn't it really beautiful? I'll put it down on the memory axis of my nice little snowflake, leaning towards the imagination axis. (Authors Note to the Readers: Suckers! Ka lost the poems!!!! I'll waste 300 pages carping about his poems, but I'll refuse to include them in the novel. Nope, not even the one that I say I recovered from a TV program. You can all go fuck yourselves.) 5. Ten minutes after 4, ah! Ipek doesn't love me! My poems don't come anymore! I want to die!! (Readers: Please go find a well, Ka. Ka ignores the readers, and goes back to 1 after spending a couple of lines on LE ISSUES!) To get back to the serious issues, even if Pamuk refuses to, women in this book are portrayed abominably. Also, shall I dare say this? They conform to every stereotype the non-Islamic world has about Islam and women. There are only two main girls in the book that supposedly deals with women: Ipek - the paragon who everyone is in love with, and Kadife - her sister, a covered girl intensely jealous of her sister. They ultimately establish the view that whether covered or bare headed, woman is objectified. What's more, she's ok with being treated the way she is. Everyone seems to fall in love with one woman after the other. Ka is indecisive to the point that several times he wonders if he might make out with Kadife while he's mentally masturbating to the image of Ipek. Ipek seems to have one trait: her beauty. She doesn't have any pride, no matter how horribly Ka treats her (or the terrorist Blue for that matter). Her only moment of decisiveness comes because of a man. There is a lot of lip service paid to the fact that Kadife is very respected because she chose to wear a head scarf, but all this is undone when it is revealed that she did it to get into bed with Blue. Blue is a player - he sleeps with Ipek, and then two-times her with Kadife, then two-times Kadife with a random girl who's supposedly her friend - and all this achieves is that the women share some kind of twisted bond. Even before that, when she supposedly stands in a room filled with men and is able to pronounce something provocative and win the respect of everyone, she can only do so because she's sleeping with Blue. And when Blue storms off in a snit, girl is completely traumatized and regrets everything she's said and is willing to do anything if only Blue would speak to her! Some role models these paragons are. There are so many glib pronouncements in the book that I would be quoting it in entirety if I were to comment on that. All the characters seem to be stuck at a mental age of four. But, I was disappointed even before I could read ten pages of this book with the poor language. I have no idea if it's something specific to Turkish writing or it lost something in the translation. These are some examples of what I'm talking about. Ka and Kadife are strolling around Kars talking about Blue, when Kadife says, \"Everyone's afraid of him. We are too. These are the butcher shops.\" At another point, Ka is absolutely untroubled by the fact that he will fall in love with Ipek. In the next sentence he is filled with dread by the very same thing. If I made a drinking game of any of these words/phrases - \"happy in Frankfurt\", \"Ipek...beautiful\", \"snow/snowflakes\", \"fallen in love with [insert female character of your choice]\", \"had a poem coming on\" - I would have died by alcohol overdose midway through the book. I could expend more vitriol on the book, but I'm tired, and my head hurts, and I hope I never remember this book again. ...more A Turkish poet coming home after his exile in Frankfurt goes to a city named Kars to meet the woman that he loves (or to be exact, he is obsessed with).

While Galip in The Black A Turkish poet coming home after his exile in Frankfurt goes to a city named Kars to meet the woman that he loves (or to be exact, he is obsessed with). If you\u2019re familiar with Macondo in 100 Hundred Years of Solitude , you\u2019ll find the same gloomy and mysterious atmosphere in Kars. Although, Kars is much much colder than Macondo since it\u2019s surrounded by nothing but snow. So, this poet known as Ka decided to visit Kars so that he can meet this beautiful woman called Ipek. While Galip in The Black Book shows his true love by roaming the city of Istanbul to find his lost wife, I found that Ka is a man who thinks nothing but sex. The only thing in his mind is how to make love with Ipek. He even sets up a plan so he can make love with Ipek while her father isn\u2019t home (a barrier for Ipek to have sex with Ka). Ka\u2019s sexual crave is also shown by some paragraphs that mention Ka is attracted to Kadife, Ipek\u2019s sister. Yet Snow isn\u2019t just a love story. It also reveals the systemic oppression to the believers in Turkey. A suicide plague happens in Kars. The interesting thing is that all girls who committed suicide wear head-scarf, a symbol of honour (to the believers) yet also a symbol of repression (to the atheist). If these girls truly believe in God, why did they commit suicide, a great sin according to the religion? This clash between the believers and the atheists (represented by the Republican) finally erupts in Kars. A stage drama turns into a massacre, and wearing head scarf becomes a symbol of rebellion. And this idea is delivered gracefully by Mr. Pamuk. I feel that he writes this down without any intention to take side. He just simply wants to describe what is happening in modern day Turkey, and Kars is the microcosm of the country. Snow is a novel with an idea that is relevant with contemporary problems. However, in my humble opinion, the weakness of this novel lies on Ka, the main character. He\u2019s not a strong and decisive character, but as a weak and dilemmatic character, he\u2019s not convincing either. I understand why the women in the story will fall for Blue (the political Islamist) instead of Ka. While the strength of Snow is on how Mr. Pamuk builds Kars with words. You can feel the atmosphere of loneliness and despair of the city. After reading Snow , maybe snow no longer looks beautiful for us. ...more Se pensate a come si dice neve in arabo, Kar, capire perch\u00e9 Pamuk abbia ambientato questo romanzo a Kars non vi verr\u00e0 affatto difficile.

Se poi a Pamuk quest'assonanza Kar-Kars manco gli era venuta in mente, mi scuso solennemente col premio Nobel, ma prendo comunque le mosse da questa mia idea associativa per spiegarvi cosa sia stataper me questa lettura di esperienza. Ho visto lo chador in molte parti dell'Europa, ho visto il burka sopratutto per le strade dell'Egitto, ma ho visto anche 'su muccaloru' nelle teste delle donne sarde dei paesi dell'interno, ma non solo. Quando si \u00e8 iniziato a parlare di 'chador', di 'velo' nelle scuole, tutti sembravano avere un'opinione, tutti sembravano volerla dire, o meglio urlare, perch\u00e9 il canone di voce obbligatorio delle faziose conversazioni talk-show sembra ormai diventato quello delle urla, eppure nessuno ha chiesto mai alle dirette interessate. Ora, lasciando da parte le donne sarde che a me hanno sempre fatto apparire lo chador un dato abbastanza irrilevante per via dell'abitudine, se prendiamo in considerazione le donne turche che coprono la testa, che coprono i capelli, in particolare le donne turche di Kars che si suicidavano perch\u00e9 da Ataturk veniva il divieto dell'utilizzo del velo nelle scuole e in luogo pubblico, dobbiamo aprire gli occhi ad un dato rilevante: che mai nessuna donna col velo di Kars \u00e8 mai stata interpellata sull'argomento. Ne hanno parlato persino le parlamentari italiane, e con ci\u00f2 ho detto tutto. Ma le donne di Kars non ne hanno parlato, e non perch\u00e9 morte eh, ma perch\u00e9 nemmeno quando erano in vita nessuno mai si \u00e8 preso la briga di interpellarle. Il nostro problema, con nostro intendo 'di noi occidentali' \u00e8 quello di filtrare qualsiasi prospettiva ci venga proposta con il prisma occidentale, che ha dato per scontato la propria superiorit\u00e0 e l'altrui inferiorit\u00e0. Se leggete 'Neve' vi troverete ad essere uno schifo perch\u00e9 purtroppo sarete Ka, volenti o nolenti, sarete il borghese occidentale, anche se nel suo caso esiste l'aggravante della provenienza turca, e valuterete tutto ci\u00f2 che di orientale e islamico accade etichettandolo come 'sbagliato'. E se per una volta ci mettessimo dall'altra parte dello specchio? Non per dare un assenso che non sia nato da vera condivisione di idee, ma semplicemente per dare uno sguardo libero da viste che i millenni hanno fatto per noi e da cui non siamo in grado di disfarci? Io sono contraria al velo che copra integralmente i connotati visuali di una persona per motivi di semplice ordine pubblico, ma perch\u00e9 invece gli orientali non potrebbero essere giustamente contrari alle Veline che vanno in tv a far vedere tette e culi che vengono poi emulate da ragazzine che per soldi si fanno profanare nei giardinetti della scuola cos\u00ec da poter comprare le Hogan, l'i-phone o il BlackBerry? Insomma, sono abbastanza arrabbiata. Non con voi eh, e nemmeno con Pamuk, che scrive da Dio. Sono arrabbiata abbastanza con me stessa per essere sempre stata cos\u00ec occidentale, e cos\u00ec poco intelligente nel valutare situazioni che accadevano sia nella nostra cara Europa sia in quell'Oriente delle Mille e una guerra. Al di l\u00e0 dello stile, della trama, dell'amore, della poesia, dell'intreccio, della sapienza di un autore con i controcoglioni,scusate l'immagine poco pudica, ma era quella pi\u00f9 efficace, il motivo per cui voglio consigliarvi Pamuk \u00e8 il seguente: perch\u00e9 vi insegna a ragionare. Se prima prendevate una mela in mano e iniziavate a mangiare da un lato qualsiasi, dopo Pamuk valutate la mela per capire bene da dove iniziare a mangiare con maggior rendimento del frutto. Va bene la metafora faceva schifo, ma era solo per trasmettervi ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato per me Pamuk. Pamuk per me \u00e8 stato una nuova finestra sull'Oriente, ma anche una finestra sulla necessit\u00e0 che ho di imparare bene e meglio di qualsiasi cosa io voglia parlare, prima di dire baggianate becere, occidentali e superflue. Insomma, dopo la mia recensione dubito che comprerete 'Neve', per fortuna Pamuk ha agenti letterari che lo sanno pubblicizzare meglio di me, di una cosa son sicura, che avete capito che sono arrabbiata, ma magari \u00e8 solo per il ciclo. A presto Orhan, e grazie per gli insegnamenti (e per l'arrabbiatura, che magari \u00e8 solo per il ciclo, bho). ...more \"T\u0101lum\u0101 m\u016bs neviens nesp\u0113j saprast\", tom\u0113r mazmaz\u012bti\u0146u ieskatu turku mentalit\u0101t\u0113 var g\u016bt.
