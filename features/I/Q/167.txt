This is a deeply disturbing book. I\u2019ve a preference for humour as a means of confronting the deeply disturbing. But I can\u2019t bring myself to say anything remotely funny about this book. Klein compares some psychological experiments (torture by any reasonable definition of the word) carried out in the 1950s in Canada (funded by the CIA off US soil so they could plausibly deny they were researching torture) in which patients were blasted back to virtually a blank slate by sensory depravation and electric shock treatment to US foreign policy in countries such as Chile in the 1970s and Iraq today. If you had forgotten just how evil unconstrained capitalism is \u2013 it is time to read this book. If you are concerned that the world seems to believe democracy = free markets \u2013 it is time to read this book. For two decades it has been abundantly clear that the greatest danger facing the world is the ideology that likes to call itself Economic Rationalism but is better described as Radical Free Market Economics . This is the view that any restraint placed on the free operation of the market \u2013 from fixing minimum wages to environmental standards to health and safety controls in the workplace \u2013 are by definition wrong and counterproductive. This view states that governments are,<---M> by definition</---M>, wasteful and unnecessary. This view is an attempt at justifying unmitigated greed as if it was a universal good. It is about destroying all vestiges of democracy (and God knows those vestiges are today meagre indeed) in our society and handing over all power to corporations. If you are not troubled by the shift in power in the world away from governments elected by the people, for the people to corporations created out of greed for greed \u2013 then you really need to turn off American Idol and start looking around yourself. Klein takes a series of increasingly distressing \u2018case studies\u2019 in which ever purer forms of radical free market economics are applied in times of crisis across the world \u2013 invariably with devastatingly negative results, invariably the opposite of what is predicted by the neo-liberals. She points out that without a crisis such as 9/11 or Katrina or the War in Iraq \u2013 such policies would never be allowed to be implemented. But come a crisis people are so shocked by what has just happened to them that they are prepared to forgo their democratic rights so things can be \u2018fixed\u2019. The problem is that these bastards don\u2019t want anything fixed. They want to apply more shocks, because that is the only way they can get rid of democratic structures that stand in the way of them handing over the wealth of our nations to themselves. The Corporate raping of Iraq as depicted in this book is only slightly less shocking than the Corporate raping of New Orleans. Perhaps I found the stuff about New Orleans more shocking because it was Americans doing this sort of thing to their own people. I know, I\u2019m na\u00efve. The descriptions of torture in the book are too much to take. I\u2019ve never been able to distance myself enough from the victims of torture to be objective about it. I believe it is the core of the democratic spirit \u2013 the notion that the sufferers of torture are our brothers and sisters and the perpetrators of torture require justice to be enacted against them \u2013 that immediately has me siding with the tortured. We have a moral responsibility to stop our government from using our tax dollars to torture people. If morality means anything at all \u2013 this is the minimum it can mean. Klein documents that the torture used throughout the world by US client states has a long history going back to experiments done in the 1950s in Canada and have clearly become part of US foreign policy. If we are to be on the side of democracy then we must force our governments to stop using torture against the citizens of other countries. Particularly when these citizens are asking for what should be granted to them immediately \u2013 the right to reclaim the benefit of their own natural resources from foreign owned corporations. There are so many lessons in this book, but the major one is that if people stand up against these greedy lunatics then we can stop them. We can reclaim our dignity and redistribute some of what has plundered from us. The criminal waste of tax dollars by these corporations in both Iraq and New Orleans is almost beyond description. In the book Iraq is at one point referred to as the Free Fraud Zone. The world we live in today is increasingly becoming divided between those who have and are kept secure behind walled suburbs and those who have not and are forced to live without the basic necessities of life. We need to understand that my security is enhanced by making the world safer for you. That life isn\u2019t about who ends up with the most stuff they don\u2019t need or the biggest bank account or the fastest car, but that we are social animals and so what is good for all is also what is good for us. As I said, this is a deeply disturbing book \u2013 but also an incredibly important one. ...more Using shock treatment as a metaphor, Klein analyzes the importance of economic dislocations and disasters to the success of Milton Friedman's free market philosophy. This is an important book, and shows why the apparent stupidities of the Bush administration in Iraq and Katrina are actually deliberate measures designed to daze and demoralize people into accepting a radical free-market agenda. \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649

A hideous, squealing beast of a book that cannot and should not be ignored. Klein has dropped the curtain on an ugly, malevolent Wizard. When these kind of curtains drop, we never like what we see. Like so many of these kinds of leftist exposes on conservatives, the Bush Administration, the neocons and their rabble, this book needn\u2019t have been written. Orwell wrote it already. But better than any other book of its kind, Klein makes it so painfully obvious that these necons who have grabbed control of the reins of this wild mustang of a country and who disdain the government so much have absolutely no business governing. Something is indeed rotten when Destruction and Doom is this profitable. It\u2019s Cowardly, it\u2019s Un-American, it\u2019s Weak, and it is Lazy. If Reading is Sexy, this book is a tour through a decrepit brothel with Klein as your guide to point out the perverse fetishes and hemorrhaging syphilitic tumors rupturing on the sides of our society. Klein\u2019s story is an epic and sprawling Indictment, providing exhaustive analysis and criticism of the disastrous economic policies pursued in Latin America, Poland, China, South Africa, Iraq, New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and in Asia after the tsunami. The Shock Doctrine is the story of Milton Friedman and his \u201cChicago School\u201d of economic policies: Led by the US and its incestuous, inbred offspring (the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO), Friedman touted an economic policy that came to be termed The Washington Consensus. It was resoundingly embraced by neocons under the ideal of spreading \u201cfreedom\u201d to countries at their most dire by installing the triumvirate of Friedmansism: 1) privatization (outsourcing), 2) free trade/deregulation, and 3) a cut in government spending. What Klein does a very good job of illuminating throughout her book is that what these neocons refer to as economic freedom does not equate to nor provide for human rights and civil liberties. Economic freedom (free trade) is not a panacea for the world\u2019s ills. A blind faith in capitalism is not enough. A dictatorship of communism or fascism is revealed to be the same as a dictatorship of Business. As Klein\u2019s gruesome story unfolds across the world, the main tenets of this \u201cshock doctrine\u201d cease to be privatization, deregulation, and pay cuts but instead Exploitation, Opportunism, Manipulation, and Corruption. Such economic polices only survived when democracy was suppressed. As Klein explains,\u201cOnce you accept that profit and greed as practiced on a mass scale create the greatest possible benefits for any society, pretty much any act of personal enrichment can be justified as a contribution to the great creative cauldron of capitalism, generating wealth and spurring economic growth \u2013 even if it\u2019s only for yourself and your colleagues.\u201d No. The Average Joe does not benefit from such disaster capitalism. People like you and I do not get anything out of such tactics, and the citizens of countries where such horrendous laws are put into place certainly do not benefit. No. The benefits go to firms like Halliburton, Bechtel, and Blackwater who swarm around the government salivating for no-bid contracts like junkies pacing the sidewalks outside a methadone clinic. Never have Disparity and Hypocrisy sung so depressing a duet. We have Socialism in America, but not for the poor, that would be Socialism! No, our handouts go to Rich Friends. The poor are getting poorer. The rich are getting richer. Private firms greedily gobble up no-bid government contracts from their fat cat robber baron puppet leader-friends straight out of corporate America now sitting in big chairs in corner offices for the U S of A. The outsourcing and branding that was successful in the private sector was introduced to the public sector. Big Business and Big Government are in a Big Bed fucking to their dirty pig heart\u2019s content. So Iraqi Freedom was really about opening up a new market for private multi-national corporations to reap absurd profits. It is a crude, obnoxious tactic and a new level for war profiteers. And once those tactics had failed in Iraq, they were used in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck. Like the pathetic drunk at the Roulette Wheel, Bush and his cronies are nothing more than stupid kids who don\u2019t learn, foolishly insisting that \u201cthey\u2019re due.\u201dWar profiteers should be treated like the drunk driving, child molesting pervert Losers they are. We all know that the Emperor Has No Clothes. But now, it doesn\u2019t matter. Our Leaders are Blind, Deaf and Dumb anyway. They are dressed, fed, entertained, and put to bed by Outsourced Contractors.\u201cWhen it came time to update the Army Manual on the rules for dealing with contractors, the army contracted out the job to one of its major contractors, MPRI \u2013 it no longer had the know-how in-house.\u201d Most disheartening is that these people seem to have lost their sense of humor. Irony is clearly lost on them. All hope is lost. Send them back to a small liberal arts college and have them suffer through an anthropology major or something. Klein again and again asks the right questions from a different perspective. A good critic, Klein consistently analyzes events and actions to determine the cause for which they are indicative of. Torture? What is that symptomatic of? What is torture serving? That is the ill, what is the disease, the cause, that needs to be cured? Klein\u2019s prose is dense and exacting, exerting the thorough confidence of a straightforward journalist asking the right questions about the right topics from a refreshingly different perspective. Given her subject matter, you actually wish she\u2019d allow herself a little more personal rage, some occasional vitriol and human madness. But no. Klein is a cool character, calmly exposing the atrocities and mistakes of our Modern Era. She even quotes Rilke, Brecht, and the rapper Juvenile. This book belongs on your shelf next to The People\u2019s History of the United States of America, but Klein is hardly the storyteller that Zinn is. But like Zinn\u2019s magnificent and important work, The Shock Doctrine is about the Little Man, the Worker, the Poor, the Forgotten. The Shock Doctrine continues on in that great and noble canon that is for The Rest. Despite such a sprawling, probing work that can at times wander and leap across themes and arguments, Klein can be quite poignant when she drops the complex and well-constructed debate in favor of keen observations. Observing the \u201creconstruction\u201d following the Asian Tsunami disaster, Klein observes, \u201cWhat it looked like was hundreds of thousands of poor, brown-skinned people (the fishing people deemed \u201cunproductive\u201d by the World Bank) being moved against their wishes to make room for ultrarich, mostly light-skinned people (the \u201chigh-yield\u201d tourists). \u201cOne thing was certain, though: if peace was to take root in Sri Lanka, it needed to outweigh the benefits of war including the tangible economic benefits flowing from a war economy, in which the army takes care of the families of its soldiers and the Tamil Tigers look after the families of its fighter and suicide bombers.\u201dWe are fighting the same exact problem in Iraq. That\u2019s the West for you, we figured out a way to get Peace. But it\u2019s War. Cheers! Some day, Historians will find the non-fiction books written about this era and probably mistake them for the plays of some raving-mad lunatic genius, the next Shakespeare. But no, unfortunately our Humiliation and our Embarrassment are Real. Klein is haunting, making you realize that we live in a world where,\u201cSurvival is determined by who can afford to pay for escape.\u201d ...more This is an ambitious book.

Obviously, certain investigative and interpretive biases are required to make this work. Third world nationalism and developmentalism, in general, get off pretty easy in Klein's analysis. As a specialist in Indonesia, I found her portrayal of the Suharto regime as a betrayal of the somehow more viable Sukarno regime a bit evasive (let us not foget that Sukarno was also an ideologue who ran the nation's economy into the ground in the name of fighting neo-colonialism). Making me wonder just how she'd cooked the books in analyzing numerous other countries whose histories I don't know so well. That said, it offers a very provocative perspective tying together some of the most significant events of the past quarter century. The thesis, simply put, is that the economic theory championed by Milton Friedman and his Chicago School, first play-tested in the third world in the 1970s, has increasingly come home to roost in the West and Bush's America. The gist of the theory, according to Klein, is a total rejection of Keynesian economics (i.e. the New Deal approach to combatting recession through government spending). In contrast, the three guiding principles of the Chicago School are: deregulation, privatization and cutbacks. (Sound familiar yet?) Transferriing as much of the public sector as possible to the private sector, eliminating government regulations of business, cutting back on services, protections and other economic benefits to the workforce. The problem, as Friedman and his disciples realized early on, is that voting citizens don't actually want any of this, and will not vote for neoliberal policies through any normal, free democratic process. The solution? Make democracy abnormal. Through shock and awe. Wait for (or instigate) a state of crisis and emergency (i.e. war, natural disaster, mass torture, revolution) and then implement neoliberal policies outside (or, in many cases, in direct contradiction to) democratic will. However, as we have discovered most recently in Iraq, such tactics don't tend to \"settle down\" into widespread prosperity for ordinary people. Rather, neoliberal governments find that if they let democracy operate normally again, they lose power. Which is why the United States ended up supporting so many dictators. In the name of spreading free market democracy. There are some sharp notions in this book. I'm particularly taken with Klein's generalization of \"Red Zone/Green Zone\" to talk about zones of normalcy and nightmare created by neoliberal policies from Iraq to post-tsunami Sri Lanka to New Orleans. She also offers a persuasive refutation of the claim that we (the US) did the Marshall Plan in Europe, but when we tried it in Iraq, Arab Muslims just couldn't handle it. Rather, while the Marshall Plan was rooted in Keynesian economics (we rebuilt Europe's governments and public infrastructure), reconstruction in Iraq has been an \"anti-Marshall plan,\" dismantling the Iraqi state and contracting all its functions to US corporations. The REAL problem of this book is how to present arguments like these to anyone who doesn't already concsider themselves anti-globalization liberals. I think that any intelligent person who has read Thomas Friedman and found his arguments somewhat persuasive, should read this book too, and decide what sounds most persuasive for themselves. Unfortunately, I think most people will look at the jacket cover endorsements from Howard Zinn, Studs Terkel et. al. and make a snap call for the usual ideological reasons. THAT is not good for America. ...more \"Everything under heaven is in utter chaos; the situation is excellent.\" ~ Mao I read it once, and I couldn't believe it.

But it runs in the face of all economics I have been taught and I find myself scorning and muttering 'alarmist' to some of the more provocative paragraphs.

I tried reading it again and I believe it even less. I want to, honestly. And I feel as strongly as the author that The Shock Doctrine is changing the world. But it runs in the face of all economics I have been taught and I find myself scorning and muttering 'alarmist' to some of the more provocative paragraphs. Thesis: The history of the contemporary free market was written in shocks. Some of the most infamous human rights violations of the past thirty\u00ad five years, which have tended to be viewed as sadistic acts carried out by anti-democratic regimes, were in fact either committed with the deliberate intent of terrorizing the public or actively harnessed to prepare the ground for the introduction of radical free-market reforms. \u017di\u017eek 's take: The imposition of a full market economy is thus rendered much easier if the way to it is paved by some kind of trauma (natural, military, economic) which, as it were, forces people into shaking off their \"old habits;' turning them into an ideological tabula rasa, survivors of their own symbolic death, ready to accept the new order now that all obstacles have been swept away. And one can be sure that Klein's shock doctrine holds also for ecological issues: far from endangering capitalism, a widespread envi\u00adronmental catastrophe may well reinvigorate it, opening up new and hitherto unheard-of spaces for capitalist investment. I will now read Seth Godin to recover. ...more I only got about  into this. I don't like the shifty way Klein argues her points. I felt like I was being propagandized rather than educated. Much of her main \u201cshock doctrine\u201d argument seems to be just sort of a tightly-woven set of linguistic parallels that are meant to suggest causation. Something like: Hitler had the autobahn built. The autobahn allowed drivers to finally race where they wanted to go. Hitler crafted what he thought of as the final solution to a race problem.

So you see, highway systems are part and parcel of genocide. You see, electro shock is a mostly-discredited method of treating mental illness that results in profound disorientation and amnesia. Electric shock s are also used to torture people in despotic regimes. People recommending against gradual economic reforms have used the metaphor of \u201c shock treatment\u201d to describe rapid, all-at-once changes. Ergo, these sorts of economists are like torturers trying to mess with our minds. And she uses the term \u201cfree market\u201d \u2014 the b\u00eate noir of her book \u2014 to cover just about any economic circumstance she doesn\u2019t like, whether there\u2019s anything free about it or not. On the one hand, the free market villains swoop in after disasters to inflict their \u201cthree trademark demands \u2014 privatization, government deregulation, and deep cuts in social spending\u201d and on the other hand, this more often than not gets illustrated with examples like the U.S. paying huge sums of money to such corporations as those who provide various contracting services in Iraq. You can call that bad, but don\u2019t call it \u201cprivatization, government deregulation, and deep cuts in social spending.\u201d And certainly don\u2019t call it \u201cfree market\u201d anything. ...more This was a very illuminating work about how chaotic situations are used, and sometimes created, as cover for the imposition of drastic economic and political reorganization in vulnerable economies.

The end product of these actions is a so-called free market model as advocated by the Chicago School of Milton Friedman and his acolytes. Examples used include Chile, China, Argentina, Bolivia, South Africa, Russia, among others. The technique is for western financial powers to swoop in during a time of financial crisis and refuse to lend a struggling nation any money until that nation agrees to a radical reworking of its economy. This reworking is done in a shock, with many changes instituted all at once, with little or no warning. These changes, as they are draconian toward the lower classes, usually need to be accompanied by severe political repression in order to enforce the transition. What we see here is the mechanism of a growing form of corporatist colonialism. Klein parallels her examination of the stresses endured by many national economies with a look at actual, literal, personal shock treatment. In the 1950s a researcher named Ewan Cameron did research on his theory that instead of Freudian therapy a more effective method of treating mental illness was to erase the patient\u2019s personality using electric shocks. Then the blank page would be receptive to reconstruction by the good doctor. The shocks caused amnesia and extreme regression. Cameron devised a new tool, one that applied six shocks at once, and even used a wide range of drugs to disorient and wipe clean as much of the patient\u2019s personality as possible. Once the subject was reduced to a vegetative state, Cameron played them tapes dozens, maybe hundreds of times over. The CIA took note and launched a program of its own. She posits a parallel between treatments that serve to erase personality with the economic and political shocks that struggling nations are forced to endure, shocks that are part and parcel of the move from a developmentalist economy, one that seeks local control and self-sufficiency, to a globalist economy, one in which foreign investment in and ownership of local enterprise is encouraged. While I found that at times Klein extended her discourse beyond the reach of her material, her analysis of the subject matter is compelling, her linkage of different forms of shock (personal, political, economic) illuminating, and the applicability of her work to the current economic disruptions frightening. Despite its subject matter, this a compelling, and relatively fast read. It should be mandatory reading for anyone concerned with politics, economics, world affairs or current events. ============================= EXTRA STUFF August 4, 2011 - the following article has particular relevance not only for the international implementation of TSD, but to its application within the USA.

It came out months ago, and I would\u2019ve read it sooner had it not cost $45 dollars in Canada. Much of the information meticulously detailed in the book was already available in Harper\u2019s Magazine and DemocracyNow!, though never put together so throroughly. She begins her book with a discussion of a canadian woman who endured several years of experimental psychiatric work under the authority of David Cameron, working in a Canadian Hospital under contract with both the American CIA and the Canadian Defense Department to discover the ways in which the human mind breaks down under electro-shock, regression, and general mind-fucking (lightless cells, limited outside contact, meals served at odd times--oatmeal for dinner, soup for breakfast, all announced as appropriate to the time of day to disorient the patient). She checked in for anxiety--discharged with memory loss, incontinence, and regression to a toddler-mind-set. Most of these experiments were part of MKUltra (most well-known for the use of LSD, less well-known as the foundation for all present \"interrogation\" tactics in the War on/of Terror). The tactics show up again in every country where the US has, in some manner, been involved in training police or military people to combat first communism, than leftism (See: Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, Columbia, Mexico). She ties this, both metaphorically and literally, to the Chicago School (the group of economists and theorists, taught by Milton Friedman, who believe in the \"free-market\" as the only scientific/natural system for human trade/relations). Friedman believed that the free-er a market is (no government regulations, no consumer protections, no corporate taxes), the more-free the people in that market will be: Democracy and Self-Rule are synonymous, then, with limitless profit-taking, no minimum wage, no state-services, etc. But there was a problem, one that he himself admitted. Time after time, people kept demanding from their governments, or forming their own, that there be a minimum wage, there be an 8-hour work-day, that water be cheap or free, that electricity and infrastructure be state- or people-run. Democracy kept tending towards \"mixed-economies\" (state or community controlled electricity, oil, water, schools, etc., as well as worker-protections and land re-distribution and more numerous small-businesses, rather than corporate conglomerates). So, then, what to do? Milton found an effective answer: Shock the fuck out of them. Already we knew that pain, applied correctly, will disorient people. Disoriented people don\u2019t fight back, nor can they even quite understand what\u2019s happening around them until they regain their footing. At least 4/5ths of the book are devoted to the history of \"shocking\" local and national movements into disorientation. Some of the shocks were manufactured (violent coups, international currency manipulation), some were hijacked revolutions (South Africa, Russia, Poland), and some were natural disasters (the Tsunami a few years back, New Orleans), but with always the same result: foreign companies buy up everything in sight, plunging already impoverished and disoriented people into further pain and poverty. ? Chile: Salvador Allende, democratically elected to be President of Chile, was assassinated by a US-supported coup by Augusto Pinochet on Sept 11, 1973. Pinochet\u2019s economic advisors were all from the Chicago School, and when he came to power, he began selling off national resources (the mines, the banks, the infrastructure) to foreign companies. To take care of the pesky problem of people fighting back, he (with CIA trained soldiers) arrested and tortured thousands of \"enemies of the state,\" stealing children from prisoners and adopting them out to supporters of the coup. ? Argentina and Uruguay: Similar situation. Some highlights included burning universities (and killing professors), destroying copies of books by Marx and Neruda. Ford Motor Company took out adverts in Argentinian newspapers to support the coup, (\"Ford commits itself to the struggle to bring about the great destiny of the Fatherland.\")--they were quite happy with the end of unions in their factories (many union leaders were actually tortured in the factories themselves). ? Poland: I\u2019m old enough to remember the strikes in Poland by Solidarity (a workers\u2019 union led by Lech Walesa), but it isn\u2019t surprising I didn\u2019t actually know what they stood for. I assumed, just as the media suggested, that all those polish workers were striking for democracy and capitalism. Wrong. Their platform was \"Socialism--yes; Corruptions of Socialism--no\": they wanted worker-control of the state-run factories and businesses, not a free-market economy. But when they won, no government would forgive the former communist state\u2019s debts, and they had no money. Enter Jeffrey Sachs (Bono calls him \"my professor\"), who offered a massive infusion of international cash with a slight catch (a do-or-die proposition, actually): take the money and privatise everything, or don\u2019t take the money and have your new people\u2019s government topple. Lech Walesa took the first (and faced massive revolt from the supporters of Solidarity, losing the next election to a proto-fascist party who promised to kick out Jeffery Sach\u2019s and the IMF/World Bank but instead started expelling immigrants, arresting gays, etc.) ? South Africa: The African National Congress (Mandela, etc.) ended Apartheid with promises to re-distribute land, give ownership of the gold mines and other resources to workers. But just as they were negotiating their relatively bloodless coup, the white south-african government negotiated economic policies with the IMF and World Bank ensuring that such a thing would never happen. When the ANC came to power, they suddenly found that there was no money to even turn on the electricity in the black ghettos, because almost all of their budget had to go towards paying down international loans the white government had taken out (and taken with them) when they lost power. ? Sri Lanka: Images of the tsunami that destroyed thousands of shanties on the beaches led millions of people to give money to the relief effort. But much of that money was channeled into the tourism industry. If you gave money, there\u2019s a damn good possibility you helped re-build a surfer-hotel. Indigenous fishers aren\u2019t allowed on the beaches anymore (\"for safety,\") while hotels got a lot more beachfront to build on (they\u2019re exempt from the 200-meter buffer zone). ? Iraq: Another created shock (it was called Shock and Awe, remember?). Paul Bremer (the viceroy of Iraq\u2019s \"provisional\" government) sold off every Saddam-era industry he could find, barring Iraqis from buying them. The \"de-baathification\" (barring Baath-party members from jobs) didn\u2019t affect many of the high-level party leaders (former generals were appointed to mayorships by Bremer) but did keep thousands of teachers, doctors, professors, and soldiers from working. The opposition to the oil-law is depicted in the media as an ethnic squabble, though every group agrees--they want no foreign companies owning their oil. That, however, is not an option the US will tolerate. Oh, and remember the purple fingers? Iraq had already held elections (spurred on by Bush\u2019s declaration that he was bringing democracy to Iraq). Those elections were annuled (sometimes violently) because the US wanted to pick the candidates. Wonder why there wasn\u2019t sectarian violence until Paul Bremer started passing laws? Look at the laws he passed. ? New Orleans: A natural shock turned into the perfect laboratory for free-market ideals. Schools were privatised, hospitals closed permanently. Neighbourhoods that had already begun rebuilding were bulldozed to make room for private developments. Reconstruction companies (including Bechtel and Halliburton) refused to hire locals, can\u2019t account for most of the money we gave them, and in many cases brought in immigrants from Mexico and didn\u2019t pay them after they did the work. This is all, of course, a very short summary. 466 pages of indictments over one of the most absurd games that has ever been played (and one that we didn\u2019t get dealt any cards for, and we\u2019re not even certain why we\u2019re sitting in the casino)--Capitalism is not a natural system, is not the same thing as Democracy, and doesn\u2019t make everyone\u2019s life better. Why the think-tanks and the Freidmanites, why Jeffery Sachs and Bono and Ayn Rand and all their ilk are given prominate discussion places within newpapers, radio and television without once having to answer for the immense suffering their policies have caused while a bunch of black folk watching their jobs and homes destroyed are just being \"lazy,\" why Morales and Chavez and Correa in South America are all dangerous dictators to be overthrown and the people who vote from them, who know intimately the history of the American Alternative (torture, poverty, drug wars) are dangerously misled----all of this is to keep us complicit in Capitalism\u2019s war against people\u2019s movements everywhere. ...more \"\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0641 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0636\u0649

is evolving in our society. I first heard Klein last week as a guest on Bill Mahr\u2019s Real Time and I was pretty intrigued. I followed that up with watching her TED Talk and a trip to my local library.

Her first book No Logo: Taking Aim at the The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein is the story of where and how capitalism is evolving in our society. I first heard Klein last week as a guest on Bill Mahr\u2019s Real Time and I was pretty intrigued. I followed that up with watching her TED Talk and a trip to my local library. Klein is a writer, journalist, and film maker. She writes a syndicated column for The Nation and The Guardian , and covered the Iraq war for Harper\u2019s . Her first book No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies is on my short list. People often ask me why do I read so much non-fiction when other concentrate their focus on fiction. Sometimes nonfiction can be as terrifying as a Stephen King novel. Sometimes it can be as disturbing as the best dystopian novels. Most of all it is real and is really happening. Klein captures this reality in The Shock Doctrine . Shock therapy was once thought to clear the brain of the learned bad behaviors leaving a fresh slate to work with or a \u201ccure.\u201d Shock therapy was also tested to extract information government agencies wanted. This process has advanced to sensory deprivation followed by very loud noises and bright and flashing lights. The idea is to disorientate and wear down the prisoner. This works. With the idea that shocking a person into submissiveness works, can the same be idea be applied to a nation? Can a nation be shocked into changing ways and can the people be convinced that the new ways are the right ways? The driving force in Shock Doctrine is Milton Friedman and the Chicago School. Fredman is a capitalist in the fullest sense. There should be no government interference in the economy. The economy is self correcting and vibrant when left alone. Keynesian Economics destroys freedom. Friedman was deeply disappointed in Nixon and his handling of the economy and his hands on approach. He later said there is more freedom in a dictatorship that has a hands off policy concerning the economy than a democracy with a hands on approach. With the US unwilling to make the drastic \u201cshock\u201d decisions with the economy his colleagues went to work in Chile trying to fight nationalization of key industries. The election of the socialist Allende and the beginnings of nationalization of copper and ITT. This brought pressure on Nixon and Kissinger to protect business interests. Allende was overthrown by a coup lead by Pinochet. The Chicago Boys (nationals trained by the Chicago School) and the Chicago school set up a drastic plan to \u201ccure\u201d Chile of socialism. The plan was also carried out by juntas in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Drastic privatization and allowing foreign ownership destroyed the economy of these countries. Nationalized industries are loyal to the nation. Private industry is loyal only to profits. Nationalization, although inefficient, creates jobs and markets. Enemies were found in these countries. Chile had its infamous stadium holding centers and missing people. People who would be dragged away in the middle of the night never to be seen again. Some went to camps, some became bodies buried in walls, others were killed, had their stomachs cut open (so they would not float) and dropped into the ocean. The biggest group of people to disappear were workers. Any talk of organized labor was seen as a threat to the economy and dealt with harshly. Public gatherings were banned. In one case school children were arrested when as a group they asked for lower bus fares. Knowing that the governments could not arrest everyone involved in labor groups, but used the people they caught as examples to others. The idea of shock treatment was also applied in Eastern Europe. Countries freed from the USSR looked to the west and the IMF and World Bank for help. The US only offered token aid and demanded that the previous governments debts would still be a valid debt. The IMF and World Bank programs came in with strings attached mostly with complete privatization and foreign ownership. What developed was a type of private colonization of newly freed counties. Klein treats Russia as a separate case from Eastern Europe. A very interest chapter on Thatcher is included. How a failing Prime Minister used a small war to claim victory against foreign enemies and turn her and the nation's interests to defeating domestic enemies -- coal miners union. Shock and Awe was not only the invasion plan for Iraq, but also its economy. Foreign ownership and a \u201cproper\u201d constitution would part of the plan. Klein brings up an interesting point in war and occupation. There were requests for troops to protect the National Library and National Museum. These requests were ignored even though troops were available. In fact, there were cases where troops watched the looting. This was not just the loss of art. It was the loss of every dissertation written in Iraq, ancient texts, and art. In short it was the theft of a nation's history and identity. It was part of the clean slate wanted by the US and international organizations and businesses. The US was not immune from shock. Exactly twenty-seven years after the US sponsored coup in Chile, the US was attacked in what was to be known as the 9/11 attacks. This shock we caused us to accept ideas and laws we would not have otherwise considered. It is frightening to listen to the number of congressmen who did not read the Patriot Act before signing it. Their reasoning was something like \u201cIt was called the Patriot Act. How could I not sign it.\u201d Suddenly people\u2019s patriotism was questioned. \u201cIf you do not support \u201cX\u201d you are unAmerican.\u201d became a rather common refrain. What can be done about war? The military wanted more troops Rumsfeld declined and responded with private security. Conflict was becoming a consumer service; War with a smile. There was at least one example of active duty Marines under the control of private security in combat. Not all shocks are manmade. Klein covers the Tsunami in Sri Lanka, Katrina, and Lebanon\u2019s aid delivery. Not everything is doom and gloom for Klein there is hope. Democracy and people in Latin America and Eastern Europe have stood up and embraced democracy and vote their interests. Shock Doctrine covers forty years of history in great deal. The work is more than adequately documented. Klein presents a clear argument of where shock capitalism came from and how it has expanded. I have pages and pages of notes on this book that I have not included in the review.

The evidence she presents is, at best, circumstantial and correlational, and it attempts to graft a veneer of evil onto the otherwise inflectionless economic policies conceived and implemented by the Chicago School under the formulative tutelage of Milton Friedman and his free market disciples. It's unfortunate, because the case she presents\u2014one drawing evidence from real world implementations across South America, Southeast Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe\u2014is sufficiently strong without such a gimmick, making illuminative associations between the onset of financial crisis within Second or Third World polities and the usage of that crisis, primarily by the IMF and World Bank, the twin arms of the market-imposing Washington Consensus, to apply the shock of harsh economic re-orderings. Such shock tactics run roughshod over democratic principles, ignoring the wishes of the afflicted populace and their elected representatives in order to enforce debt repayment and impose free trade, with a focus upon building an export economy, the doing of which entails the crushing of unions, scaling-back of wages and welfare provisions, privatizing of industry, healthcare, and pensions, and propping up/creating central banks that an ordered honoring of foreign debt might be effected. It allows her a greater leeway with stamping her Shock classification for the various state unraveling and IMF patching together in a manner conducive to transferring wealth to the banks and corporations of the already mighty West at the expense of the well-being, financial prospects, and civil rights of the struggling nations being commanded to so arrange their economic affairs. However, painting Milton Friedman as an evil man is simply pure polemic\u2014and for some of her case studies Klein also fails to make clear to the reader important factors such as the parlous state of affairs prior to the stepping in of moneyed interests; the agendas of incumbent or freshly installed governing parties in the afflicted nations; political, cultural, and/or ethnical strains between the demographic constituencies of that polity, etc. In other words, there were myriad currents at play during several of these crises, and such complicating elements as nuance, subtlety, and interconnectedness can be given short shrift by the author when they do not fit themselves into her more simplified, more black and white determination of causality and purpose. In consulting sources of a differing interpretation than Klein's\u2014and particularly relevant in the South American polities, where the postwar practice of Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) had produced domestic industries rife with inefficiencies, corruption, and foreign debt\u2014it becomes apparent that, in some instances, and in one form or another, things were plenty grim beforehand; and if there was money sufficient for a reasonable system of safety nets, it came via the liberal supply of foreign cash sent in to governments riddled with corruption and economic stagnation. Such is not a sustainable way of life\u2014or, at least, not in the modern globalized evolution of it; and while Klein does point out how, with changes administered through governmental fiat via democratic pressure further down the line, when a measure of stability and economic strength had been maintained, several of the countries put under her microscope managed to achieve a better standard of living, she does not deem to allow that those early systemic shocks, in clearing out much deadwood and forcibly requiring governments and privatized industries to make gains in productivity and competitive prowess and adherence to accountability and the rule of law, were instrumental in setting the stage, however austerely and painfully, for those later ameliorations to be grafted onto a sturdier and more potentially enduring structure. Some of the cases, as I noted. For others, like the Apartheid-turning of South Africa and the liberalization of Russia, Klein's critique is witheringly close to the mark. The fire sale conducted under the auspices of Western governments, with a huge proportion of former state-owned industries being transferred, for absurdly low prices, into the hands of a rapacious private industry, is simply inexcusable. And in the Iraq invasion and Hurricane Katrina, Klein presents a solid argument regarding the manner in which free market enthusiasts used such breakdowns in order to carry out a coup against one country's economy and another city's public services. Klein also raises very relevant questions about the iron-bound requirements placed upon newly liberated countries to make good for the grotesque debts run-up by previous dictators and despots: we are long overdue for a serious reworking of debt-forgiveness in such cases. It's not a simple thing to iron-out, for significant portions of that debt\u2014at some level of the tiered flow\u2014represents the savings of lower- and middle-class families who had no part in either the pre- or post-shock ordering of things\u2014and it is for such reasons that I look forward to eventually tackling books like David Graeber's Debt which confront this problem head-on and with touted creativity. The Shock Doctrine is a valuable contribution to modern political and fiscal discussion\u2014with its encompassing thematic detail, mustering of evidence (however selective in certain cases), and, most enjoyable of all, the author's superb writing. What's more, there are plenty of volumes out there proclaiming the wonders of our recently erected globalized market system; those such as Klein's are a welcome tonic, sobering in their presentation, righteous in their outrage, and compelling in their urge for readers to question exactly how manipulable these recurrent financial crises are, both in the way they are brought-about and settled afterwards. ...more A very disturbing book indeed. I can't decide whether I feel that her paranoia got out of control, or whether it is indeed a fair representation of US foreign policy over the last 30-40 years. A lot of it rings true. Though I hope that the links between torture and economic theory are not as clear as she paints them... that was the part I had the hardest time swallowing. Maybe we will learn more now that the Neo-Cons are going to lose control of the US. ___________________________________ I can't A very disturbing book indeed.

Maybe we will learn more now that the Neo-Cons are going to lose control of the US. ___________________________________ I can't help thinking of The Shock Doctrine when I see the daily headlines here in Britain about the drastic changes our new government intends to make. Klein argues that the standard tactic the right has used is to wait for a crisis of some kind, and then use it as an excuse to rush through policies which they've prepared for this eventuality. In some cases, they engineer the crisis intentionally. Okay... I can see that some of the government's policies can be defended as as a rational response to Britain's enormous debt. And then you have things like reducing the number of MPs from 650 to 600. This is very advantageous to the Conservatives. But the official justification is that it will save \u00a312M. Now, people are often bad at comparing big numbers. We owe something around \u00a3900B, largely as a result of having to bail out the banks during the credit crunch two years ago. Let's divide by ten million and try to relate it to something we can actually understand. So, I'll suppose that my cousin somehow persuaded me to invest in his business venture, which sounded sensible but actually turned out to be a pyramid scheme that collapsed catastrophically. To our horror, this has left us saddled with a personal debt of \u00a390,000, which we're slowly trying to pay off. Not surprisingly, my partner is all over my case, and is taking the opportunity to get her way on a number of issues while she has the moral upper hand. But when she uses this argument to motivate not buying a copy of a Sunday newspaper that I like and she doesn't, and which costs \u00a31.20, I feel she's gone too far. A saving this small makes no real difference. It's just exploiting the situation. Well, as I see it, that's roughly what our government is doing now. ...more As someone who used to consume nonfiction with the voracious appetite of a trucker at an Old Country Buffet, I find it odd and not a little unsettling that, since joining Goodreads, a solid 95% of my reading material has come from the fiction side of the bookstore.

While this has definitely helped fill some dramatic gaps in my knowledge, it was with much relief that I tucked myself into Klein's The Shock Doctrine earlier this week. I'd attempted reading this in the heady afterglow of the election this past November but I was not in the mood to be depressed so soon and replaced it on my shelf. Two months into Obama's presidency, as the economy crumbles into so many pieces which are then greedily consumed by the jackals that make up the banking industry, Klein's definitive history of Friedman economics and their entwined history with brutality, terror and disparity seems especially apt. Granted, Friedman didn't do this all on his own. Rather, as Klein's thesis bears out, this occurs through a system of shocks to the nervous system of the target country, much as electro-convulsive therapy was developed as a means to wipe its subjects mind so that it could be reformatted into a socially acceptable form. The first shock is generally political upheaval- a coup, terror attack, or governmental collapse, though Klein points out that natural disasters such as the 2004 tsunami and Hurricane Katrina work just as well, that so upsets the regular routine of life that citizens are willing to invest extraordinary powers in the government and silence any dissent for the duration of the emergency. Sound familiar? Next comes the economic shock, during which the social safety nets so despised by free-market zealots are taken away and former nationally-owned industries (oil, mineral, postal services, arms contracts, education, healthcare, pretty much everything) are \"privatized,\" or sold at cut-rate prices to foreign investors who, through some never-explained sleight of hand will then lead the country into its bright capitalist utopia. Of course, as profit-driven enterprises are wont to do, this generally leads to corruption at unprecedented levels, currency inflation and record-bursting unemployment levels. \"Relax,\" the economic advisers say (these well-trained theorists from Friedman's Chicago School of Economics), \"these are just the birth pangs of a new economic era. Everything is under control.\" Which is very true. Everything is very much under control . For, as social unrest grows, the next shock is coming. These are the state-sanctioned terror squads that quell social unrest by creating an atmosphere of unwavering brutality and terror. These are the Disappeared leftists of South America, herded into football stadiums and machine-gunned, the distraught funeral gatherings broken up with water cannons and riot police. These are electrodes under the nails, omni-present surveillance, bodies dropped from helicopters into farmer's fields, couples black-bagged during their own wedding ceremony and carted into torture facilities, in front of hundreds of witnesses who are all so very afraid to be next that they refuse to even acknowledge that the event occurred. Klein charts the evolution of the titular Shock Doctrine from it's intellectual beginnings at the University of Chicago in the 1950s in horrified reaction to the New Deal and the Keynesian philosophy that holds that a country's economy should work to best serve the working classes that are it's lifeblood. Milton Friedman, godfather of this Doctrine, develops his economic theory of free-market systems using oh-so-precise calculations (this is the man who cried and recited Donne's \"Ode to a Grecian Urn\" upon seeing a geometric proof) yet lacks a real world opportunity to test them in. Enter Chile in 1974, an alleged 3rd world country who has just elected the radical Salvador Allende who is promising further nationalization of vital industries and expanded benefits to its citizens. Obviously the man is a dangerous Marxist and must be deposed post haste, says the US-based United Fruit Company who has much to lose if these nationalizations occur. No sooner said than done. With the useful assistance of the CIA, the military executes Allende and installs General Pinochet as dictator who, with assistance from his Chicago Boys (worshipers at the fount of Friedman) dismantles the complete economy and disappears hundreds of thousands of upstart leftists. Okay, so that was a bit too bloody for the world's tastes, but you can't argue with the profits. A few people got extremely rich, clearly the market works. Let's try that again, but this time a bit more slyly. So Klein ushers us through nearly every political upheaval of the past 30 years, from the Thatcherite Falklands War to the end of Apartheid in South Africa and communism in both Poland and Russia, illustrating in very explicit detail the cooption of movements in the name of free-markets, the economic blackmail of the IMF's structural adjustment programs, and the destruction of true freedom in order to create free markets. What is shown is not a series of isolated events but the creation of post-nationalist systems in which the state serves as the source of endless wealth for a very few and muscle for the extortion that takes place in the name of freedom. Most effective is how, after hundreds of pages of showing how this program (or pogrom) worked overseas, Klein brings it home to the US and shows how the terror attacks of 2001, the Iraq War, and the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina allowed the Friedmaniacs to enact their policies in the states. Complete lack of oversight, no bid contracts, unregulated markets and massive speculation all ran rampant during the seven years of Bush's reign and Klein does well to show exactly how this system led to the economic armageddon that engulfs us today. It is my only hope that Obama and his advisers have read and believed even one chapter of this book and seen Friedman's system for the massive fuck up that it is and are now looking to pull Keynes from the wilderness and enshrine his values firmly in the passages of law, finicky governors be damned. ...more I would seriously like to see every human on this planet read this book. I can\u2019t think of any other book I would more highly recommend today. The whole text was rich in the exposing of history and deep analysis. I strongly encourage anyone reading it to stick through to the end. The bulk of the book covers quite terrible things in the world, but the last chapter actually made me very hopeful and inspired. Utterly brilliant! (spoilers ahead, but it's not fiction so don't worry about it) Where do I begin? This is a failed Noam Chomsky book. Firstly, Klein is working with a strange definition of capitalism.

This is a failed Noam Chomsky book. Firstly, Klein is working with a strange definition of capitalism. When the free market economists who Klein refers to (like Friedman and Hayek) talk about capitalism they are referring to an economic system free of government intervention. Klein however uses the word capitalist to refer to the current economic model\u2013 one in which governments and corporations work in tandem to exploit the general population. (Edit: I realize that \"capitalism\" has multiple definitions, but the problem is that Klein uses a different definition from the economists she is criticizing, which makes her entire criticism seem like an assault upon a strawman). Klein has essentially built a book around conflating capitalism with corporatism. This is fairly subtle in the first chapter, but reaches a point of real absurdity towards the end of the book. There is a clear distinction between the policies advocated by Hayek/Friedman, and George W. Bush. Klein purposefully obfuscates this. The Shock Docterine starts out criticizing Milton Friedman for his activities in Chile. This is at least understandable because Friedman did in fact visit Chile and advise Pi\u00f1ochet. However, this is more or less where the facts begin and end. She soon moves on to more dubious claims- for instance, blaming Friedman and his acolytes for the Iraq war in particular (a war he expressly opposed) and the military industrial complex in general. It should be obvious to any reader that this sort of alliance between business and government has little to do with free markets, private property rights, or \"capitalism\" as defined by Chicago or Austrian school economists. By the end of the book she really goes bonkers. She details the plight of several Sri Lankan fishing communities. Here is the story as she presents it: A hurricane hits Sri Lanka destroying many coastal settlements. Hotel companies see an opportunity decide to take possession of the coastal property, which has been conveniently cleared of all those pesky villages. The hotel companies move in and take possession of the beaches. When the villagers protest, the government police force defends the newly acquired beaches on behalf of the hotels using violence. The villagers are reduced to living in poverty and squalor because their land was stolen from them by the alliance of hotel companies and government. In summary, The hotel companies used the government to steal the private property of the fishing communities. And this is supposed to be an example of free market practices that Hayek and Friedman would approve of. See the issue I'm having? A modified version of this book would actually make for an apt criticism of corporatism, which is why I was tempted to give this book two stars. However, the problem here is far deeper than a confusion of terms. She actually ascribes neo-Conservative ideas to Libertarian or Classical Liberal thinkers. The Shock Doctrine is essentially the strawman from hell. And for that it earns 1 star. ...more There are many detailed and eloquent reviews of this book already; however, I still feel like I have to write a review about this important book. I've wondered for years why the world is the way it is. Why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Why countries in Latin America and Africa are so poor and undeveloped. \"Geez, South Africa, why can't you just get your s**t together and be like America? In fact, why can't all these countries be like us, what's wrong with them?\" Well, ladies and g There are many detailed and eloquent reviews of this book already; however, I still feel like I have to write a review about this important book. I've wondered for years why the world is the way it is. Why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Why countries in Latin America and Africa are so poor and undeveloped. \"Geez, South Africa, why can't you just get your s**t together and be like America? In fact, why can't all these countries be like us, what's wrong with them?\" Well, ladies and gentlemen, the questions have been finally answered. This book literally turned my world upside down and changed my views on politics and economics. Mind = blown. No kidding. So here is one of the reasons why the world is a messed up place: the shock doctrine, a dangerous ideology that has been implemented by the \"great\" economist Milton Friedman and his misguided acolytes since the 1970's. The plan is to shock people (whether it's through a natural disaster or a man-made one) and disorient them, and then swoop in implementing economic policies that benefit very few, and cripple many. The economic policies are: 1.) deregulation of markets - free trade baby! 2.) privatization of everything - congratulations, your job has been outsourced! 3.) tax cuts and elimination of social services - sorry old and poor people, you are on your own! The most evil thing about this is that while America preaches freedom and democracy, the only way such policies can be implemented is through a repressive, dictatorial government. And if you resist, you'll most likely be shot, or tortured and then shot. Just ask the people in Chile and Argentina. They were the first countries to go through this experiment. While the people of these countries suffered from repression, poverty, torture, and death, the political leaders declared such economic policies as successful. After all, it made them SO MUCH money. This policy has spread to other places: South Africa, Asia, Poland, Russia, etc. It made my blood boil to read about the way the Russian people were duped into such harsh economic policies. People's pensions were taken away, social services cut; all of a sudden millions of people couldn't afford even a loaf of bread. People were CHEATED out of everything they ever believed in. Instead of freedom and democracy, they got starvation, abject poverty, and a huge rise in crime. If you think that this can only happen in other countries, just look at what's happened right here in America the past few years. Read about how much the people of New Orleans were swindled after Hurricane Katrina happened. Look at the state of the economy. Yep, Bush's tax cuts and deregulation of Wall Street really helped us. Ha! I don't want to rant and rave anymore in this review. That is not my wish. I wish instead for everybody to read this book because it will open up your eyes, my friend, it will show you how we all have been lied to and deceived. It is only when we become aware of this problem, that we can work to change it. ...more \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0642\u0631\u0623\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0633\u0623\u0642\u0631\u0624\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u064a!

On the one hand, \" 'Day of Wrath' brings Russians on to the streets against Vladimir Putin \" bears out her thesis of citizen blowback against unrestrained capitalism. So apparently does \" How China's internet generation broke the silence \". That article, however, goes on to note: Many in the west see it as self-evident that an increased flow of information will make officials more accountable and encourage people to challenge them. Yet studies of the internet's impact in China are inconclusive. One found that people with access to unofficial information and the internet actually held a more favourable view of inequalities and the party's justification of them. Another showed that blog posts on subjects such as political reform and freedom of expression were increasingly frequent, even when controlling for the rise in bloggers. And \" Britain leads in war on poverty, according to US academic \" positively contradicts her other thesis that countries like Britain with its more Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism do worse than European socialist counterparts: Britain's story on child poverty is also better than many in Europe. While the UK child poverty rate fell, \"[it:] was rising or constant\" on the continent. \"Denmark, which had the lowest child poverty rate in the group in 1995, at 6%, saw its rate rise to 10% by 2006.\" The trouble is that reality is often far more complicated and nuanced than her rather capacious and sweeping theories acknowledge. In dealing with the Asian financial crisis of 1997, she refers to Malaysia\u2019s refusal to bow down to IMF might and its prompt installation of exchange controls. This is indeed credited for Malaysia's faster recovery and for it being less battered by the crisis than the countries that had accepted IMF\u2019s remedies. So far I agree with her. On the other hand, Malaysia\u2019s Prime Minister, Dr Mahatir, would never have accepted IMF\u2019s conditions of opening up the economy to unfettered foreign investment not because of some altruistic desire to protect socialist policies, but for the reason that he is the architect of the pro-Bumiputra policy which requires that all companies in Malaysia be majority-owned by Malays, the ethnic majority in the country. The policy was intended to transfer wealth from the property-owning Chinese into Malay hands and has ended up benefitting only a small percentage of rich Malay families. Rural poverty remains a problem. This policy of \u201caffirmative action\u201d would evidently have been jeopardised by IMF policies calling for open foreign investment. Thailand, on the other hand, which accepted the IMF loans and which saw its rural poor battered by the results ended up with a beneficiary of the reforms as its Prime Minister. Thaksin Shinawatra came to power in the general election of 2001, and became hugely popular, particularly in the north and north-east of the country, enfranchising the rural poor, and offering them healthcare for about US$0.50 and low-cost loans. He is also the country\u2019s telecommunications mogul who had plans for privatisation of state services. The current protests going on in Bangkok by pro-Thaksin supporters, the Red-shirts, is as much a struggle between the rural poor and the wealthy royalist elites who have largely ignored rural problems and see Thaksin\u2019s popularity with the poor as a threat to their own power. Each of these situations have inconvenient elements that are ignored and glossed over by Ms Klein in her book which presents a straightforward narrative of capitalist oppression under Friedman-omics with its manifesto of using shock and destruction to force down and implement unfettered free market policies. This is something that I find utterly infuriating as it does a disservice to the important reporting that she has to tell us. Her evidence showing that Friedman-ites were perfectly comfortable with using lies and statistical manipulation to bring a country\u2019s economy to its knees was a critical indictment of them. The reporting that she does on Canada and Trinidad is particularly enlightening in this regard. She also reports on the very important process of decentralisation and corporatisation of government functions in America by the neo-cons*, and how that has led to a reduction in standards in important services like infrastructure repair and education. This was something I found particularly frightening since a reduction in government power is not synonymous with greater individual freedom. Power vacuums do not remain unfilled: they are filled by other competing power centres like corporatists who have even less interest in maintaining true liberty. Hopefully, the election of Obama to the Presidency may reverse this trend. Ms Klein also deserves thanks for her expos\u00e9 of the lie that capitalism arises from natural human urges and that once states get out of the way the people will embrace the free market with love and fervour. This is a reductive theology and ignores the fundamental cultural differences between societies, and which underpins capitalist market behaviour. In addition, the swathe of destruction and misery that radical free market economic policies cause is a side of the story not often told while the destruction wrought by a people\u2019s revolution (from the bloody French revolution of 1789 to Stalinist and Maoist purges) is generally well-known and too often harped upon. There is no doubt in my mind that unfettered free markets are a bad idea. The much touted rising tide that raises all boats has turned out to be nothing more than a rising tide of inequality. Nevertheless, a number of wrongs that she parks at the doorstep of the free marketeers are not particularly capitalist or Friedman-ite regardless of how shameful they are: -- The right\u2019s blindness to the wanton destruction and savage repression of their dictators like Pinochet is matched by the left\u2019s blindness to the wanton destruction and savage repression of their dictators like Stalin. -- The opportunistic use of chaos to implement new regimes is no different in kind from calls of bloody revolution. Nor are capitalist-pig-Friedmanites the only ones who have sought to install blank slates in their societies. So, where does that leave me? I\u2019m very glad I read it. I learnt a number of interesting facts that I did not know before. But it infuriates me that she mucks up her very important story with tome-thumping polemics that do nothing to boost her credibility except to preach to the already converted. This is a story that is too important and deserves far better than that. I'm still giving it three stars but it's five stars for the cautionary tales that she has to tell and minus three stars for the way she tells it, and plus one because I can't bring myself to give it only two stars. *I love the irony that \"con\" in French means roughly \"dick-head\". I'm more than happy in that light to refer to Cheney and his ilk as neo-cons. ...more Because I'm about 3 pages away from returning it to the library, I've all but stopped reading this (and a buddy has told me that there are only specific passages that are worth reading, so I'll go find them, instead).

Klien hasn't actually argued anything that has any basis in reality. It's kind of feels like I'm listening to Sean Hannity or Ann Coulter, but instead it's a liberal who hates free markets and Republicans. It's just one liberal talking point after another, sans documenation, lots of anecdotes followed by the summary dismissal of \"all because of Milton Friedman and the Chicago school of economics\" or \"all because of shock free markets.\" But I'm still waiting to hear that she's even talking about the results of free markets. Her entire argument seems to be \"free markets equal evil\" but she neglects any type of logical connection between the two. Example: she jumps all over charter schools, but never really says whats wrong with them or that they aren't working. The only problem she sites is that the school unions are gone and that teachers don't like them. She implies that they are keeping the poor out of schools, but does not say it, because under a voucher system, students are funded to exactly the same level as under a non-charter system; they just get to choose what school they attend. IN otherwords, the public is still paying for a free education, but now students and their parents get to choose what school....but what's wrong with that? She doesn't say. Just says \"it's bad for unions and teachers who worked in public schools before hate it\" (though she doesn't actually site any teachers). Example: she jumps all over Chile because \"Pinochet was there\" but never really makes a connection between Pinochet and the free market, other than to say \"because they both happened at the same time, it must have been the free market that lead to all those people being tortured.\" What she doesn't mention is that Chile is the 8th most free economy in the world today and is ranked 3rd in the Americas (behind Canada and the US) and has experience 5% growth over the years from 2004-2009...but she doesn't ever talk about that or that today, after getting rid of Pinochet, Chile is one of the strongest, free-est, and fastest growing countries in South America, to say nothing of the world. Oh, she also forgets to mention that Pinochet is not in power any more but was ousted a long time ago. Example: she attacks free market implimentation in Iraq, but fails to mention that most countries don't have ANY economy after a war, and that implimentation of an economy in Germany and Japan after WWII and in Korea after the Korea War didn't do too bad for them...in fact, it made them three of the strongest economies in the world. Implimentation of a non-free market economy in the countries of Poland, Romania, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Estonia, and Belarus didn't exactly work out for them...just ask the millions of people who had to live through it, then go ask the millions in West Germany, France, Italy and Japan that did benefit from the free market after WWII (as well as Korea and Singapore) Example: she lays blame for the Asian crisis at the doorstep of the free market, but what she doesn't say is that these countries were already free markets before, and that after they have rebounded faster than those that were affected by the crisis but were not free economies. Example: she attacks the free market for Russia's woes, but the free market was never implemented there. The Kremlin has taken over control of the media and oil companies, as well as several other large conglomerates. A list of the fifty richest people in Russia is also a list of the KGB class of 1999 and the \"friends of Putin.\" Example: Tienanmen Square a precursor to the free market? This is a clear case of the tail wagging the dog. It is widely credited as being the crisis that took down the then current party leadership in favor of leadership willing to open up China to allow more economic freedom, not the other way around, as she proposes (that it was the suppression of all those masses who wanted democracy, not economic freedom, silly...why would they want that?). So, I am eager to know what redemptive qualities are in the book. It reads like liberal drivel that one only believes if it provides supporting evidence for what one already believes.

It is a sickening read. The book describes how Milton Friedman's economic theories work when put into practice by admirers such as the American Republican Party, and the second President George Bush. Friedman's ideas have consistently produced failing States. Iraq is one example the author discusses with plenty of evidence of how it is done: outsource the war to private security firms and the following plan of 'nation building' to corporation employees in place of government employees. Outsourcing promotes the theft of billions of taxpayer money through inflated billings while incompetent contractors look as if they are doing something to fulfill their contracts. Klein also shows how governments, in trying to save themselves from a variety of economic crises, have employed Friedman's horrible policies, imposed on them by various international powers and banks, end up in reality impoverishing their citizens while foreigners and homegrown elites extract most of the wealth created and deposit it to their own personal bank accounts. What the shock doctrine is, it is forcing a country to sell off most of its assets. Rich men take advantage of natural disasters or intentionally created financial crashes which bring a country to its knees. When a country is faced with a sudden disaster where many people are suddenly out of work and governments are stunned by the suffering and fear and destruction, banks and corporations move in and rape the country while promising to fix the problems with cash (borrowed at high interest) while imposing strict limitations on social security, fuel supports or food subsidies to the poor. The banks also force the sale of publicly owned electrical grids and water and sewer plants to private foreign companies and countries, who then fire the local employees and raise the price of the heretofore affordable necessities of daily life. Poverty rates typically jump from perhaps 10% to 30-60%. In other words, a troubled country is forced into deeper, more painful difficulties intentionally in order to force the selling at rock bottom prices of everything of value to business entities which have no interest in helping or saving the country's citizens. While people are shocked and fearful because of disasters, they meekly allow the foreign corporations to 'save' them by stealing their assets and starving them. Friedman also promoted using the most extreme methods on any protestors who dare to fight back at being raped, robbed and starved to deepen the shock and upset, through what used to be called brainwashing methods. In actuality, it means using torture. Friedman thinks these policies will improve the functioning of everything eventually; however, Klein demonstrates in example after real world example (Brazil, Argentina, Iraq, Indonesia, Thailand, and others) how Friedman's theories when put into practice actually destroyed the lives of millions of people and enriched only the top 1%, and as a bonus brought unbearable suffering to the 99%. ...more There is a kind of history that gets overlooked, that doesn't get taught in schools or universities aside from a fourth-year optional course that no one bothers to take. It's a history that is fundamental to understanding our world, both past and present and where the hell we're going. It's a history that touches everyone, regardless of class, gender, race or age, but that slips out the back door before anyone thinks to call it to account, put it on trial and expose its heinous crimes. I'm talki There is a kind of history that gets overlooked, that doesn't get taught in schools or universities aside from a fourth-year optional course that no one bothers to take. It's a history that is fundamental to understanding our world, both past and present and where the hell we're going. It's a history that touches everyone, regardless of class, gender, race or age, but that slips out the back door before anyone thinks to call it to account, put it on trial and expose its heinous crimes. I'm talking about economic history, the history of economics, and the power economics plays in everything that happens in the world. One of my biggest problems with the current trend in economic theory - what is called neo-liberal or neo-conservative economics, Chicago School economics, Reaganonomics, free-trade economics; whatever you want to call it - is that it's missing something pretty damn big: the human element. They talk about this economic theory not only as if it were the only way to do things, or the best way, but as if it is autonomous of people - governments, business people, workers, farmers, the homeless. That because of this absence of a human element, it is Good, and Right, and acts in Our Best Interests. Nothing could be further from the truth. It would be impossible for economics to behave independent of any human interference, or action, governmental or otherwise. Impossible, and undesirable. Those that benefit most are the same old villains: the greedy top 2% of the population, that holds more than 50% of \"global household wealth\". Trickle-down economics is complete bullshit, and always was. What the real result is, though, is an economic theory that is wholly unaccountable for what it reaps. There are many things I love about this book. Klein puts the human element back into Chicago School economics, detailing with exhaustive research the impact of the policies of this economic theory on the many peoples of the world it has been forced onto (forced is the right word; more on that later). Giving the \"ordinary\" people of the world a voice is incredibly important, and is like shining a light on the free market's blood-stained hands. It also exposes the real motivations behind the pretty speeches, the mercenary nature of this kind of economics, and the strings attached to the hands of the men (and few women) manipulating events and making the most money from it. Yes, it always comes down to money, for these people. What a predictable clich\u00e9 they are! But dangerous too. What began as a book on the invasion of Iraq and what Klein at first thought was a recent \"fundamental change in the way the drive to 'liberate' markets was advancing around the world\" (p.10) became, as she dug deeper, something much bigger. She realised that Chicago School economics, and its figurehead Milton Friedman, has been experimenting with many countries over the last three decades, and that the theory is even older. The theory is one of \"radical free-market 'reforms'\", of using natural and man-made crises - shocks - to stun a population into a stupor while a government forces these \"reforms\" onto the country. This is one of the ironies of Chicago School economics, which Klein highlights: Friedman touted it as going hand-in-hand with democracy and freedom, when the exact opposite is true. The kind of economic reforms he advised leaders to put in place were the kind that instantly robbed people of jobs, freedom of speech and movement, even their lives. Their early experiments in South America - Chile, under Pinochet, and also Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Brazil - involved by necessity a dictatorship, or corrupting or manipulating a democratically-elected, often socialist government, and using further \"shocks\" - torture, imprisonment, disappearances etc. - to stop the people from revolting. Meanwhile, big international corporations would sweep in and buy up all the newly privatised industries, then dismantle them, fire everyone, and run off with the profits. Opening up a country for privatisation, in these cases, never benefits the country itself. This seems so glaringly obvious it's amazing that so many dictators and other leaders bought into it. Sometimes they had no choice. Often held to ransom by the IMF and World Bank, or even by \"aid\" money in the aftermath of these crises, these shocks, they bowed down to pressure and did what they were told. The Shock Doctrine traces the path of the use of Shock Therapy from humans to countries and their economies, from Chile to South Africa, from Russia to Sri Lanka, from America to Iraq. The need to create \"clean slates\" on which to build \"model countries\" and \"model economies\" was never more determinedly tried than in Iraq. Klein successfully shows how Washington's drive to wipe the country of its history, to break it down and then slap this new economy onto it, had in turn helped create the violence, the fundamentalism that wasn't there before - or not widely supported by its population. After the invasion, when Saddam was dethroned, the Iraqi people were indeed filled with new hope. They almost immediately began putting together their own local elections, democratically - for the first time in a long time - electing their own representatives. The man in charge of the country at the time, Paul Bremer, who was hurriedly writing new laws to open the country up to private investment from America, quickly put an end to these demonstrations of people's democracy. Hypocrites all. The book does end with some hopeful signs of recovery. South America, a place that has always had a highly politicised population, has come out of its collective shock and is slowly rebuilding, putting their countries back together again, picking up what was so bloodily interrupted all those years ago but this time with shock absorbers in place so that it cannot happen again. I have always highly admired the various people of South America, who - if they had not suffered what they did - would now be one of the most prosperous places in the world. By turning their backs on globalisation and free-market ideology, on disaster capitalism and all the muck that comes with it, they are once again on the path to something quite beautiful: a more ideal third way, a more harmonious structure that is as far from totalitarian communism (think China and the USSR, North Korea and Romania) as it is from disaster capitalism. They are the ones to watch. The Shock Doctine is not an easy book to read - the prose is inherently readable and approachable, but the subject matter is intense, often depressing, incredibly sad and disheartening at times, and fills you with rage. It has answered many of the questions that have puzzled me for so long, that no one else has bothered to properly explain - like why did Israel suddenly attack Lebanon, and why are they being such bastards with the Palestinians? What the hell happened to South Africa when Apartheid was supposed to end? Why is Iraq such a mess? and many more. Because the economic theory \"began\" in America, and was so readily absorbed in that country, a lot of the book focuses on that country and certain people from it - but it is also a victim of its own policies, and I learnt a great deal about the hollow government Bush Jr. and Rumsfeld created, which contracted out (at the cost of billions and billions of taxpayer dollars) so much of its responsibilities that when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, it could do nothing. It had no money, no resources, no manpower, no skills. Tragic. Klein doesn't go into why America, the institution, is so ripe a place for this kind of economic theory, but I believe the book goes well with Ronald Wright's What is America? I would have liked to hear more of what impact other countries, like the UK, had in Iraq, but they got barely a mention. According to the point of the chapter, though, they weren't important. I've seen elements of this economic theory play out in my own home country, without the use of shock treatment: John Howard implemented all sorts of disastrous and unpopular policies, from cutting funding to Austudy (now Youth Allowance), universities and public schools (my old primary school couldn't even afford a librarian and had to lock up its library for most of the week); he privatised Telecom (many Australians bought shares - it's ironic, because before privatisation they already owned it) and put through a new Minimum Wage law for 15 - 18 year olds, so that MacDonalds could fire its adult workers and hire cheap teenagers for the same job; as well as a law that enabled companies to fire employees and rehire them on contracts, meaning they had no job security (no unions either), no benefits or holiday or sick pay, and were essentially paid less. So sometimes it does happen without shock therapy - and Klein points this out too, though the cases are more rare and the policies are tamed down by the people - but Howard also had a dangerous majority and happily labelled anyone who disagreed with him (including the thousands of protesters) as hooligans and \"un-Australian\" - his biggest insult. The Shock Doctrine is important, profound, educational and eye-opening. I would say that you might need to be in the right frame of mind for it - if you whole-heartedly disagree with the importance of government regulations and services, with nationalised education, health care and industry, if you think that free-market economics is inherently \"good\" for the middle class and poor people, that America is doing a \"good\" thing in Iraq, if Friedman is your idol and you have stocks in Halliburton or Lockheed Martin or CH2M Hill, you are not going to like this book. Regardless of where you stand, it is confronting. But if you've ever felt the slightest unease over certain reforms and policies, if the word \"progress\" and \"growth\" don't necessarily equate \"good\" and \"inherently right\" in your gut, and if you care about the people no matter their country or skin colour, who have slipped further and further into poverty - this is the book for you. You might never look at the world the same way again, and that's a good thing. You might never blindly believe what you hear, and that too is a great thing. You might pause a moment to think \"what's really going on here that CNN is smugly glossing over?\" and that is a fantastic thing. ...more \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631

Naomi Klein, I recently finished reading your latest book, The Shock Doctrine. Your detailed account of the connections between neoliberal economic policy and the use of violent repression, the decline of welfare states, and the rise of corporatized war and disaster capitalism is compelling. You thread together the recent histories of military brutality in the Southern Cone of South America, union busting in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s England, and the Tiananmen Square massacre in China. Through th Dear Naomi Klein, I recently finished reading your latest book, The Shock Doctrine. Your detailed account of the connections between neoliberal economic policy and the use of violent repression, the decline of welfare states, and the rise of corporatized war and disaster capitalism is compelling. You thread together the recent histories of military brutality in the Southern Cone of South America, union busting in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s England, and the Tiananmen Square massacre in China. Through these histories you make explicit that acts of violent political repression against leftist organizers were not chance occurrences during periods of economic transition. On the contrary, you show that they were deliberate acts of \u201cshock therapy\u201d used by governments to numb and eliminate those opposed to the implementation of neoliberal policies such as the privatization of public services, the elimination of spending on social programs, and the deregulation of industry wage, safety and environmental standards. You demonstrate the \u201cconstricted freedom\u201d of post cold-war governments in Poland, Russia, and South Africa, who, in spite of initial aspirations to build social democratic welfare states, ended up implementing neoliberal economic reforms with disastrous consequences for the majority of their people. You then bring your analysis of neoliberalism to the United States, describing the rise of the privatized war machine and the parallel emergence of the occupation of Iraq as a profitable market for investments in military technology, homeland security, and the rebuilding of basic infrastructure destroyed by the aforementioned military technology. Finally, you tie it all together by concluding that the neoliberal economic model, in its thirst for new markets, is now preying upon areas struck by natural disasters to accumulate the profits it desires. \u201cDisaster capitalism,\u201d as you aptly name it, was evident in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and in Sri Lanka after the tsunami when large numbers of poor people were prevented from returning to their weather damaged homes in order to create lucrative new investment opportunities on the land they previously inhabited. The most sinister part of neoliberalism\u2019s trajectory, as you note at the end of your book, is that when war and disaster are profitable enterprises, there are increased incentives to start wars and allow natural phenomena to deteriorate into social catastrophes. To begin, I want to say that I learned a lot from reading your book. I was continually impressed by your ability to organize complex historical events into easily understandable patterns. You have clearly demonstrated neoliberalism\u2019s historical dependence on political, economic, and physical \u201cshock.\u201d I am writing you, however, because despite my deep appreciation for the work you have done, I also have a major concern. You do an excellent job of describing many of the problems that come with neoliberalism, but I am afraid your analysis does not give a good account as to why neoliberal ideas are being implemented in the first place. Without a clear understanding of why neoliberalism is the policy of choice for many governments and economists today, you fail to put forward a comprehensive vision for how neoliberalism can be transformed. For these reasons, I am concerned that many people will read your book and become motivated to make change, but will not be equipped with the right tools to do so. I am concerned that without the right tools, these motivated people will continue to focus on pressuring governments and/or economists to make change but will have little success persuading them to do so. I am concerned that these motivated people, after not having much success, will start to believe those who say that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union prove that free market capitalism is the final stop on the train of economic history. Moreover, I am concerned that these motivated people, frustrated by their inability to make change, will reluctantly give into the idea that capitalism (and the neoliberal ideology that now accompanies it) is the only way to organize economies after all. With these concerns in mind, I would like to suggest that you take a look at another book that maps the rise of neoliberalism in the latter half of the twentieth century. The book is The Dilemmas of Social Democracies by two Peace Studies Professors at Earlham College, Howard Richards and Joanna Swanger. Instead of focusing on the violence and repression associated with neoliberal economics, Richards and Swanger focus on rules. They would argue that your book takes a wrong turn on the second to last page of the introduction when you make the claim that there is no reason that market-based economies are incompatible with decent wages, free health care, and quality public education. They would say that there is a very good reason that markets and government led social welfare programs do not mix: the basic cultural rules that shape our current economy do not allow them to. They would explain that until the basic rules of our economy are changed, governments have few options for making economic policies that serve the needs of all of their people...

I felt her analogizes between economic shock therapy and torture practices were quite fitting. I found her chapter on South Africa particularly informative, because it explained how the ANC managed to fail so miserably in the economics arena, which is something I'd always wanted to understand. And I was SO glad that she repeatedly took on Jeffrey Sachs--I'd had some serious doubts about him since reading his End of Poverty , and she filled in many of his omissions and turned many of his assertions upside down. My only minor complaint is that I was surprised she didn't discuss her shock theory in the context of the 1970s oil crisis--as far as global economic crises go, you'd think that one would deserve at least a mention, and I was left wondering why it was left out of her otherwise very thorough analysis. Basically, this book expanded my understanding of both history and the contemporary world, and I think about it every day, especially when I'm reading the news. ...more \u0628\u0633\u0647\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0623\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a \u0642\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u064a\u060c \u0642\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0648\u0647\u0634\u062a\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u062e\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0631\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0641\u0631\u0635\u0629 \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 I'm going to begin this review with the most important part: Read this book.

I knew that Dick Cheney isn't to be trusted as far as a paraplegic could throw him, that Dubya himself is far from being the no-brain borderline illiterate that he liked to play on TV, and is beyond devious. And I may just piss off a lot of people here, but Obama's no better. What happened to withdrawing our troops? What happened to not allowing lobbyists into his administration? What happened to \"greater transparency in Washington\"? I could go on and on... I consider myself to be somewhat informed, but this book made me feel like I was born yesterday. I've lived through many of the conflicts detailed in this book, and while it's true that I was a child for most of them, I've also lived through the last 8 years when I was not a child, and I feel woefully ignorant of the world after having read this book. It was definitely an eye-opener. I've never been much for economics, I grasp the basic concepts (supply and demand, etc), but it was never one of my strong points in school. And in school, mine at least, we were given a basic overview, a test, and a grade, then sent on our way. There was no in depth analysis, no history to examine the different types in a real life scenario, no discussion of how economics can influence policy or politics. So, essentially, we're left completely unprepared for econo-political manipulation. Klein begins the book by talking about Dr. Ewen Cameron, and his techniques in the 50's for trying to create a blank slate of the mind in order to rebuild a new and better personality in place of a \"broken\" one. To such breakages including anxiety or depression or OCD, he would apply massive doses of experimental drugs - LSD, PCP, etc - along with multiple shock therapies at many times the average or recommended limit, as well as isolation, disorientation, and depersonalization techniques. He was determined to \"peel away the onion layers of the mind\" and arrive at a blank slate which he could then rewrite with the desired attributes... \"You are a good wife and mother,\" or \"You are not afraid of public places,\" etc. Many, many people left his \"care\" more damaged and broken than when they came in, which memory loss, muscle damage or bone fractures or broken teeth from the high voltages used on them, to name just a few physical effects, and many of them had these techniques performed on them without their knowledge or consent. Terrifying. This is the good doctor that assisted so willingly in the CIA's research in their mind-control and brainwashing program, MKULTRA. Klein mentions this with good reason, which is that a traumatic event, or a shock, is the best time to shove through massive and sweeping economic policy changes. While the general public is busy trying to put their lives back together, they aren't looking at what is being done behind the curtain, and therefore cannot interfere. The type of changes outlined here are ones that are easily recognizable if you know to look. Klein called it \"Extreme Capitalism\", it's essentially a free market economy in which all goods and services are privatized and unregulated. The stated theory is that with all government \"interference\" (read: regulation) removed, the free market plan will just magically stabilize itself and be a perfect economy. Except, this is patently impossible - even a blind person can see that. Greed prevents it. People who own the industry that's been privatized will want ever more profits, which means higher costs, which leads to inflation, while people who have lost their goverment or union provided jobs to privatized industry have no means to pay for the goods or services, which leads to more and more desperate poor while the rich profit off of their need to eat. Naturally, to prevent revolt and uprisings, harsher and harsher methods are needed to keep the people under control, which is where terror comes in. People are tortured, taken from their homes, kidnapped, imprisoned, and outright murdered to 1) remove the threat from people who stand against the economic misery that they've been subjected to, and 2) serve as a message to anyone else thinking of making a stand. Klein outlines country after country which has given Extreme Capitalism a go, and in every case, it ruins the economy of the country, and the lives of those who live there, while fattening the bank accounts of a select few elite who profit off of the masses. This perfect plan creates outrageous national deficits, unheard of levels of unemployed, and astronomical profits for the companies which have been privatized. I'll never look at my government, or any government, the same way again. Greedy exploitation at any cost. What better than an unwinnable and perpetual war then to continue the exploitation and corruption? Ugh. It's sickening. National identity, heritage and history are destroyed to make way for Wal-marts and McDonalds and 7-11 stores. Iraq's national museum, which housed priceless and irreplaceable artifacts from the beginning of human history, was looted and many artifacts are destroyed or missing, all in an attempt to wipe away the cultural memory so that there will be a clean slate for the new corporate economy and nation. This review sucks. Just read the book. Really. I can't do it justice. It's important, and if you don't feel sick afterward, I might suspect that you're a multi-gajillionaire corporate mogul just stepping off of some newly-impoverished country's back on your way to the next. =\\ 4.22.10/ Edit to add: In honor of Earth Day, I was sent this slide show, and I think it's relevant, so I'm linking to it here. www.Miniature-Earth.com Watch the slide-show.

This book is a good example of that hesitation. I've left this book un-reviewed for almost 4 years now because I have been so moved by the power of Naomi Klein's work. This book changed my already pretty skeptical view of current capitalism to a much more open-eyed horror. Her investigative journalist's eyes are informed by an almost academician's breadth of her subjects. And she's yet to fail me in offering a fresh new perspective to issues with which I was already burdened by outrage-overload. In \"The Shock Doctrine\" she has managed to assemble a comprehensive overview of our frightening heritage as heirs to the legacy of colonialism and capitalism. And she masterfully ties the current state of political insanity with the economic and military exploitation of those of us unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of today's predatory global environmental and financial climate. And \"those of us\" really includes you and me; open your eyes. Naomi Klein's powerful skill is that she is capable of just that--opening our eyes. ...more \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0641\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a
