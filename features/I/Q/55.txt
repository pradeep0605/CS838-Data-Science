And I laughed out loud, crying and giggling for minutes when I first heard of Babbity Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump . My favourite tale is The Fountain of Fair Fortune . It just warms my heart every single time I read it. It's quite the opposite of The Warlock's Hairy Heart , but in a way I still love the utter disgust and shock it produces. Dumbledore's notes are pretty spectacular as well. I love how he shamelessly tells Lucius Malfoy off in his letter about banning a tale from the Hogwarts Library. And by Merlin's Beard is Aberforth so fascinated by goats? It's always going to remain a mystery to me. This is an amazing, original collection of wondrous and beautiful, cruel and magical tales. If someone can create fairytales that feel like they could be in Grimm's collection, then it's definitely J. K. Rowling. I never thought it possible that someone could write a fairytale, that feels as old and magical as the ones I grew up with. But I also never thought that a writer could have such an impact on my life. Find more of my books on Instagram ...more Apparently I'm getting this for Christmas. ROCK ON. ...Having not read this yet, my favorite part was that on the day it showed up on Amazon it immediately placed above Breaking Dawn for most preorders ever received (currently in system, obvy). It was like, okay, everyone who says Smeyer is the new JKR. Smackdown. Finally read, years later: Loved it. I felt very warm and fuzzy reading new JKR. How can I not love an alleged children's writer who mentions murder, mutilation, cannibalism, adultery, and bestiality all within the span of 110 (ultra-short) pages? The stories are on the meh side, but Dumbledore's commentaries showed a smart, literary eye that reminded me briefly of Pale Fire. I'm all, \"Hey, JK, you did your thang.\" Be that as it may, I'm a bit offended by the Dumbledore's anti-anti-Muggle bias.

And I have Muggle heritage myself (but don't tell anyone I said that, EEW EEW EEW!) so you know I can't be magicist. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I think, \"Go back to where you came from, Mudblood!\" So I did -- but the staff at New York Presbyterian wouldn't take me back. ...more I actually started this a few nights ago and would read one story each night but completely forgot to add it to my currently reading shelf!

I can't believe how much effort J.K. Rowling put into every single aspect of her series, just to make it that much more wonderful. I love how she wove magic into five completely different stories of her own making. This takes so much time, effort, and devotion and I will forever be grateful for all the love that she puts into her books. I will continue to reread these lovely tales whenever I need a little magic in my life. Hopefully in the future I will also read these to my children along with the Harry Potter series. Every addition to this amazing series brings me so much joy and I can't say enough good things. I highly recommend giving these a read! You won't be disappointed! She gave it her all and I could never give this less than 5 stars! ...more Reading a Hogwarts' library's book with the fables taken from ancient times in it along with the notes and guidance of Dumbledore himself, is a magical feeling beyond explanation.

With every J.K.Rowling book, before reading it, I instruct my mind that you are holding a brilliant collection in your hand, and so it turns out to be. The five legendary tales in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, took me to the time I used to hear tales from my grandparents when I was a kid and they were with me. Most intriguing part about the stories were that unlike the heroines in the fairy tales, the real world witches had to do their homework in time, so they can acquire the magic, power and mastery they are searching for. It is their hardship and their tenderness that led them to gain what they wished for. The stories are not just stories. If you go by Dumbledore's notes and analysis, they'll relate you to Harry Potter books more and how they were being taught. It was a constant jump from fables to rational thinking that has been described by Dumbledore. A great book to have in a Potterhead's collection, with the stories that every child who wants to perform magic must know. I just want to add this image here though it might seem not related : ...more If you know me, then you may know that I've tried to read fairytales from the Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Anderson, and from the collection of Arabian Nights and have been unable to finish any of them because I honestly didn't like the stories and thought they were overly preachy and odd.

Taped across the front of the small buffet table was a sign that said \"Join us at 12:01 for Tales of Beedle the Bard!\" Needless to say, I squealed aloud with delight, and my best friend blushed with embarrassment at being seen in public with a squealing Harry Potter fan. I could hardly believe that I had forgotten the realease date for the storybook Harry Potter fans everywhere were waiting for! Of course, I searched frantically for my wallet, but it was nowhere to be found, lost in the abyss that is my purse. As I began to walk away with my head hung low, Kristen, the dearest friend I've ever known, then took me by the hand and led me back to the table. She told me that she would buy me the book as an early Christmas present, but I had to promise to love it. And that very night, after I had finished the book, my promise was kept, and I loved it. ...more Clever Rowling... Giving us a small fix of her world, to spread the Harry Potter magic a little bit further (as if it still had further to go). This is really just a book of \"fairy\" tales a la the Magical World. Apparently, if we'd been raised as wizards and witches, we would've heard these tales at our mother's knee. Which, to be honest, is a little scary, in some cases - since at least one is pretty seriously disturbing. Still, when you think about our own fairy tales, they're pretty disturbing Clever Rowling...

Which, to be honest, is a little scary, in some cases - since at least one is pretty seriously disturbing. Still, when you think about our own fairy tales, they're pretty disturbing too. Anyway, this book contains a witch who turns herself into a \"stump\", a crabby son of a wizard with a crazy pot, a journey to a magical fountain as well as the infamous tale of the three brothers. The tales themselves are fine. Witty, in some cases, maybe a bit slow in others. What I found the most entertaining was the \"commentary\" by Albus Dumbledore that follows each story. He puts the tales in \"historical context\" and often references people/circumstances that hardcore Potter fans will relish recognizing. If you loved the Harry Potter series, it's worth reading just to spend a little time with Dumbledore again. Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: To hurt is as human as to breathe. ...more I'm having a hard time deciding which is my favorite tale, but I'd lean towards The Fountain of Fair Fortune, with the The Warlock's Hairy Heart coming in a close second (if only it had been executed a little better!). Keeping in mind that these are wizarding fairy tales, with commentary by Dumbledore and translated by Hermione (oh MAN, wouldn't it be awesome to get into a crazy discussion about Hermione as a biased translator? Dumbledore's comments are obviously 100% biased) - the book is really I'm having a hard time deciding which is my favorite tale, but I'd lean towards The Fountain of Fair Fortune, with the The Warlock's Hairy Heart coming in a close second (if only it had been executed a little better!). Keeping in mind that these are wizarding fairy tales, with commentary by Dumbledore and translated by Hermione (oh MAN, wouldn't it be awesome to get into a crazy discussion about Hermione as a biased translator? Dumbledore's comments are obviously 100% biased) - the book is really quite cute. It shouldn't take you much more than 30 minutes to read it but I was expecting a short read(and honestly, my #1 complaint is the binding -t he book just feels awkward, and I am dreading when the spine is obviously cracked open). Spoilers start here: Tale #1: The Wizard and the Hopping Pot: The most obvious morality tale in the book. A young man inherits his father's cauldron and his father's requests for aid from needy (but humble & worthy!) Muggle neighbors, resists with an attitude, and is taught a lesson in charity. I found Dumbledore's notes more interesting than the tale itself. Tale #2: The Fountain of Fair Fortune: Almost a Wizard of Oz-type story; a Muggle Knight and 3 witches quest for their greatest wish to be granted at the Fountain of Fair Fortune, but end up solving their problems on the journey. I really think JKR could have expanded this out into much more of a short story, although it does make sense in the fable/fairy tale format. Really quite cute, and the \"happiest\" of the bunch. Tale #3: The Wizard's Hairy Heart: Obviously the darkest tale; a man turns to the Dark Arts and cuts himself off from enjoying life by literally taking his beating heart out of his chest so he will never be hurt. Dumbledore's notes sort of point towards the ZOMG TERRIBLE HORCRUX IS TERRIBLE idea, but never outright says, so this Tom Riddle kid TOTALLY ate this one up at the Muggle orphanage--OH WAIT, HE TOTALLY DIDN'T. Tale #4: Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump: A really stupid Muggle king wants to wipe out witches and wizards, gets scammed by a con man, but his dishwasher is a real witch and not only stops the persecution but even gets a gold statue through her own cunning. I think this was my least favorite out of the 5. Tale #5: The Tale of the Three Brothers: We know this one from Deathly Hallows, but 3 brothers run into Death, get the Elder Wand, the resurrection stone thing, and the Invisibility Cloak. Brothers 1 and 2 are totally dumb and die pretty quickly, but Brother 3 knows meeting Death is inevitable, but hides and lives into old age. Again, Dumbledore's notes are very vague, and full of, NOW, THIS WAND/STONE BUSINESS IS TOTALLY FOLKLORE (also, can I just say how much the term Deathstick amuses me to no end??) BUT INVISIBILITY CLOAKS RUUUULE. Overall, it's sort of cool to think how these tales might have played into the upbringing of some of the characters. The Weasley kids probably heard all of these 10 million times. Oh, AND! I forgot, my favorite part is when \"Dumbledore\" goes into as close as he can get into a rant about censorship concerning the content of the tales (the Malfoys across the ages are big into banning books). It's even more funny considering HP's history, and the fact that JKR was nice enough to let Dumbledore give the gentle smackdown. ...more What a great and cute addition to the Harry Potter series! Fairy tales from the wizarding worlds which very much look like our fairy tales, but which are unique as well. I especially loved the tales about the hairy heart and the three brothers, and now I'm quite eager to watch the upcoming movie as well :) If you love fairy tales and if you love Harry Potter, I'm pretty sure you're going to love these tales as well! Finished my first book of 2015 and my first book of the Winter Biannual Bibliothon! This was a really great, short, fun book to start off with. Ach Albus \u2661 Not much to this book.

After each story is a boring (almost arrogant) review by Dumbledore, who tries to convince you how great and meaningful they are. The longest story in the book, about the brothers involved with the Deathly Hallows, is just repeated word for word from the last book in the Harry Potter series. You will glean a few tiny tidbits of information you never knew about some of the unimportant characters from the series (such as Sir Nicholas the Ghost), but otherwise this 'book' will be forgotten. A shame since I loved the main series. ...more \u0644\u0645\u062d\u0628\u064a \u0647\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0628\u0648\u062a\u0631 \u060c \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631 :) For the love of Joanne Rowling For the love of Hogwarts For the love of Potter-heads For the love of memories and for the love of magic..

Perhaps it's because they're actual stories with characters and even moral underpinnings, or perhaps this collection just hit the spot. :) I enjoyed Albus's voice here, but in the end, I think I simply enjoyed the tales for themselves. Little dark fairy tales. :) I have nothing bad to say about little dark fairy tales. :) The most beautiful fun you can have is when you know more about a once loved book that you couldn't departure easily.

...more A very quick and interesting read! I loved how J.K. Rowling connected this little book with the characters of the Harry Potter series. It was almost like reading a real collection of fiction from that Wizarding World. She's really a genius, and I'm glad she wrote this as an addition to the Harry Potter series. I truly need more from her. As some people know, it took me one hell of a long time to become a fan of Harry Potter. But once I did, I was completely sucked into that world. So when The Tales of Beedle the Bard came out, I was such a huge Potterhead that I had no choice but to buy this enormous special edition.

I've included a number of photographs in this review to give you a good impression of just how special this special edition actually is. The actual book has small iron works which make it quite heavy and just add to the overall atmosphere. The tales actually are tales - not encyclopedic information as in the two previous school books. As fans of the series know, the tales (one especially) are quite important in the end. There are five tales in total, as well as Dumbledore's thoughts on all of them, an introduction and a \"personal message\" at the end. All the tales are fantastically magical and quirky but also carry a sense of foreboding and are heavy with meaning. Great writing in all of them, that sucks the reader right back into this fantastic magical world. ...more Juro que este libro se le leer\u00e9 a mis hijos.

People of magical means in the world of Harry Potter, on the other hand, are supposedly familiar with the inherently supernatural stories of fifteenth-century author Beedle the Bard. His stories have long been available in the wizarding world in a single volume titled The Tales of Beedle the Bard , and presumably it's a perennial presence in the Daily Prophet bestsellers list. J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter's billionaire biographer, was gracious enough to release an annotated, albeit abridged, version of the collection for Muggle public consumption in 2008, a year after the publication of the last installment in her series of books about the life and times of Harry Potter. The public edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard authorized by Rowling is notable for having two of the most important figures from the Second Wizarding War (1995-1998) involved in its development. Hermione Granger, a distinguished Muggle-born alumna of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and a confidante of Harry Potter's, translated the tales from their original runes, while Professor Albus Dumbledore, a former Hogwarts headmaster and Harry Potter's eccentric mentor, provided a delightful and insightful commentary on each of the tales included in this slim collection, with clarificatory, intertextual, and metacritical footnotes appended by Rowling. Rowling also supplies her own hand-drawn interior illustrations for the five handpicked tales in the book and, in her usual omniscient and ingratiating authorial tone, a brief introduction to Beedle the Bard (\"We know that he was born in Yorkshire, and the only surviving woodcut shows that he had an exceptionally luxuriant beard.\") and his body of work. In her preamble she points out a significant difference between Perrault and company's tales and those of Beedle the Bard. \"In Muggle fairy tales,\" she writes, \"magic tends to lie at the root of the hero or heroine's troubles--the wicked witch has poisoned the apple, or put the princess into a hundred years' sleep, or turned the prince into a hideous beast. In The Tales of Beedle the Bard , on the other hand, we meet heroes and heroines who can perform magic themselves, and yet find it hard to solve their problems as we do.\" This is because, she concludes, \"magic causes as much trouble as it cures.\" And how! In the opening story, The Wizard and the Hopping Pot , an irritable wizard inherits the cauldron used by his recently deceased father in getting rid of their Muggle neighbors' many troubles, ranging from dermal protuberances to missing mules. But in refusing to follow suit, turning his back on every suffering Muggle asking for his assistance, the wizard soon faces some troubles of his own in the way the earthenware heirloom grows a metallic foot and seems to sprout and spew physical and acoustic annoyances that are reflective of his discouraged neighbors' woes. To reveal the ending here and now is scarcely an act of spoiling: it's a predictably happy one, with the wizard skipping alongside the newly slippered pot upon learning a thing or two about tolerance and equality, lessons that are related to the ones imparted on an arrogant Muggle monarch who wants to monopolize magic in the book's penultimate tale, Babbity Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump . The conclusion of the second tale, The Fountain of Fair Fortune , is happy as well, not dissimilar to Disney's classic fairy tale endings, but it cogently conveys a nice twist to the arduous journey taken by the main characters, three crestfallen princesses and a fallen knight, to reach the legendary fountain with cure-all waters. The twist, revealed quietly in the story's final sentence, speaks of the power of persistence and selfless love, the ultimate panacea and undoubtedly Rowling's favorite subject. But lest one suppose that Beedle the Bard's fantastical yarns invariably end in favor of their characters, the remaining two tales offer less auspicious turns of events and resolutions. One merely needs to conjure a mental picture of the ghastly object in the title of the third tale, The Warlock's Hairy Heart , to get an inkling of how fate strikes a dreadful blow not only upon the title character, who in the beginning of the story is only figuratively heartless but soon becomes literally that after locking up his cardiac organ in a chest, but also upon his unfortunate bride-to-be, whose own heart is coveted by her cold-blooded suitor. And the last parable, The Tale of the Three Brothers , while it does not contain an image as repulsive as a beastly beating heart, homes in on a most serious matter: death. Those who have read the final Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , or seen at least the first part of its film adaptation will recall that The Tale of the Three Brothers plays an integral role in the series' conclusion. It tells of the mysterious deathly hallows themselves and how three brothers of differing ambitions procured them\u2014the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand\u2014from Death after cheating him by way of magic. Before the eventual triumph of Harry Potter over his lifelong adversary, the dark lord Voldemort, it was dismissed within wizarding circles as nothing but a somewhat scary bedtime story. But since the world of Harry Potter is itself a bricolage of myths and legends, it's hardly surprising that in this imagined reality the deathly hallows turn out to be genuine and, in the hands of the self-sacrificing few (e.g. Harry Potter), instrumental in conquering death. The Tale of the Three Brothers is the shortest among the stories in this edition, and probably among all in the Beedle the Bard canon, but in its relative brevity it is more than adequate in making the most lasting remarks on humility, death itself, and human, Muggle or non-Muggle, folly. No wonder it was wise, old Dumbledore's favorite: \"This story made a profound impression on me as a boy. I heard it first from my mother, and it soon became the tale I requested more often than any other at bedtime. This frequently led to arguments with my younger brother, Aberforth, whose favorite story was Grumble the Grubby Goat .\" Should Rowling publish a second public edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard , this unmistakably comical caprine fable would be a very welcome addition. \u2014 Originally published on Fully Booked .Me ...more I will definitely read this book to my children .. they will not know Cinderella or Snow White, they'll know Babbitty Rabbitty, The 3 brothers and other stories from my world*wizarding world* ----- This book contain 5 short stories with Albus's notes on them 1-The Wizard and the Hopping Pot When a father(wizard) who used to heal the muggles dies and leave his work to his son 2-The Fountain of Fair Fortune A fountain that can make whatever you want come true.. but only one can use it! 3-The Warlock's I will definitely read this book to my children .. they will not know Cinderella or Snow White, they'll know Babbitty Rabbitty, The 3 brothers and other stories from my world*wizarding world* ----- This book contain 5 short stories with Albus's notes on them 1-The Wizard and the Hopping Pot When a father(wizard) who used to heal the muggles dies and leave his work to his son 2-The Fountain of Fair Fortune A fountain that can make whatever you want come true.. but only one can use it! 3-The Warlock's Hairy Heart A wizard wanted to silence his heart, never to fall in love using dark arts 4-Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump A king seeking power and magic but also hunting the wizards and witches 5-The Tale of the Three Brothers the most famous brothers in the wizarding world, defeated Death and received gifts from him ...more Spoiler for anyone that hasn't finished the Harry Potter series and plans to ....

The warlock wants to protect his heart from pain, so he locks it away. But, at last, when he feels it is time to use his heart, he finds that years of neglect and denial of warmth and love have shriveled the heart and it will no longer work for him. May we, mere muggles that we are, and as risky as it is, allow our hearts to be touched and warmed every day. ...more If you are looking for more Harry Potter type stories, this is not the place to look.

There are five stories contained in this collection, but perhaps the most important is The Tale of the Three Brothers , which documents the beginning of the Elder wand and the Invisibility cloak and reminds us all that Death, while not something we can escape, is nothing to be feared. ...more<---C>J.K.
