Now see here, I am normally not a grammar stickler, but this lapse in judgment, I think calls for a public flogging of either the author or the editor.<---F> Possibly both</---F>. Have I mentioned before that I really hate writing negative reviews? It is so much easier to rant and rave about how wonderful a book is, than it is to point out all the problems I had with it. Just saying. The original concept of this book was at first compelling and interesting. The idea that love is a disease that has, in the near future, been cured. The fact that love has been classified as \"the most deadly of deadly things\" and that the government is sanctioning and actually requiring all citizens to undergo a lobotomy at the age of 18. After which they will be assigned a mate. The original concept is a bit incredible, but I am actually ok with \u201cincredible\u201d as long as it is portrayed in a believable way. And for the most part, it was. As the book progressed however, I kept finding undeniable parallels to Matched and Uglies . I found Lena, our protagonist and narrator, mostly weak, annoying, and infuriating. For example, there is a point in the book where (view spoiler) [Lena is caught with her love Alex, and consequentially is tied up in her room by her family. She is counting down the hours until her forced \u201cprocedure\u201d and contemplating suicide. (hide spoiler) ] At this point Lena actually compares herself to (paraphrased) \u2019the princesses in the fairytales \u2026 waiting for her prince to rescue her\u2019. Sorry, but, that about induced vomiting. -And I mean that in the best possible way. The narrative voice is flowing, steady, and easy to follow. It was just interesting enough to keep you reading to find out what happens next. Believe it or not I actually really liked the ending. If there is a single redeeming virtue in <+++>Delirium</+++>, this is it. I am not sure if I liked the ending because (view spoiler) [one of the annoying characters was brutally eliminated from the plot in a bloody and melodramatic fashion (I am joking) (hide spoiler) ] or more likely, because it seemed somewhat fitting with the whole Romeo and Juliet theme that the author kept hinting at. It was also marginally unexpected, which is always a good thing. I have put the next book on hold at the library, I am not sure if I will read it or not at this point. I can see how some people would really like this book, but it just wasn\u2019t for me. I couldn\u2019t possibly give it a higher rating than a 3. If you are a fan of sappy teenage romance books you would probably enjoy <+++>Delirium</+++>.

Stories about love tend to go that way sometimes. They wander into the realm of cheese and never return, which I think is a shame, because there is a way to write about romantic love without breaking out the Velveeta. And Lauren Oliver does it. A few reasons why I loved this book: 1. It was well-written. Lauren Oliver strings words together like a poet-- she makes beautiful things surprising, if that makes sense. Sometimes writers fall back on the expected, and it can still be beautiful, but that's not Delirium. Unexpected and stunning-- that's how I would describe the writing. Read this quote: \"Somewhere deeper in the city a motor is running, a distant, earthy growl, like an animal panting. In a few hours the bright blush of morning will push through all that darkness, and shapes will reassert themselves, and people will wake up and yawn and brew coffee and get ready for work, everything the same as usual. Life will go on. Something aches at the very core of me, something ancient and deep and stronger than words: the filament that joins each of us to the root of existence, that ancient thing unfurling and resisting and grappling, desperately for a foothold, a way to stay here, breathe, keep going.\" 2. The world felt real. With some dystopian books, I have trouble believing that the world could actually turn out that way, even given the right set of circumstances. But with Delirium, I got the sense that it took place in an actual neighborhood, one that I could go and see, but with this looming sense of awfulness that is the fact that no one loves each other, no one can love each other. It's just a few notches away from where we are-- add a few dashes of government control and a \"cure\" for love and a few more rules/procedures/rituals and you have the world of Delirium. It does not feel like somewhere else; it feels like here. One thing that helped this were the quotes at the beginning of each chapter, taken from made-up historical/religious/etc. documents related to the \"dystopian concept\". They gave me the sense that this entire movement in history had occurred before the opening of the novel, and that if I kept reading I could connect the dots from where I stand today and where Lena stood in the narrative. 3. It wasn't just a love story. Oliver's focus is not just on how romantic relationships are impacted by the love cure; she also went into the realm of family and friendship, too. About how those relationships break without love, and about how friendships would change without love. What I love about this is the way it's done-- with subtlety, so that you almost don't notice how terrible things are until suddenly, you do, and you ache for what Lena has lost as a result of the world's dissolution. Something I'd like to see more of in YA books is an exploration of many different kinds of relationships, not just romantic ones, so this book did that for me. 4. The ending. I'm not going to tell you what happens. But...AHHHH. ...more It is clear, the new genre of dystopian romance is here to stay.

Ugh! And why did Lauren Oliver decide to dabble in this genre instead of sticking to what she knows best? I am trying to be nice here, but Oliver has no talent for speculative fiction. I worry about this career choice of hers, because as of now she, as an author, is lost to me for at least 3 years. I am not interested in more Delirium books. I love dystopias, I love how authors take current social and political trends and extrapolate them into future showing to us what can happen if these trends persist. The versions of future envisioned by Margaret Atwood built upon consequences of excessive genetic engineering or Paolo Bacigalupi 's - upon global warming and exhaustion of natural resources - are plausible and horrifying. Lauren Oliver 's dystopia is based on a premise that love is considered to be a serious, life-threatening sickness, and thus outlawed. Outlawing love, apparently, solves all world problems. Now, I can buy a world where strong emotions are suppressed (see The Giver ). People in such world would be subdued and docile, and thus lack drive for power and violence. But love? Really? The characters in this book cured of love, still get aggravated, annoyed, worried. They just don't love their spouses and kids. And retain almost all other emotions. And the \"horrible\" consequences such premise brings about - neighborhood patrols, segregated (by sex) schools, arranged marriages, the horror! If, according to the author, this society is so constrictive, why is it so easy for teens to avoid curfews, to have parties with alcohol, to meet up in abandoned houses for some schmexy times, to fake being \"cured\" of love, to breach supposedly guarded borders? What is written to be scary and menacing in the Delirium 's society just isn't. As a dystopia, this novel fails completely. The only aspect of the setting that is interesting is that how author twists Christian mythos to adapt to the love-is-a-dangerous-sickness premise. The focus of the story, and an excuse to write this dystopia, is, of course, a romance. I wish I could say I enjoyed at least this aspect of Delirium , but I didn't really. It is mildly more exciting than the one in Matched , slightly steamier, and at least doesn't have a love triangle (yet). But there is still a self-insert main character (shy, ordinary, plain) and the main male emo squeeze, quoting poetry, who falls for her anyway. I am exhausted by this arrangement. Authors, why don't you write books about something a little more important than a month-old teen romance? Especially if you choose to create a dystopian novel, which, by definition, encompasses the entire world and supposedly endangers and oppresses all humanity. ...more December 2011 review: I adored Delirium when I first read and reviewed it, which was back in February.

I had limited experience with dystopia, only having read Matched , The Hunger Games , and Uglies , but Delirium made it one of favourite genres. I\u2019ve come across many young dystopian novels since then, and having re-read Delirium , I can safely say that it is still one of my favourites and one of the best books I\u2019ve read this year. Although Delirium is a dystopian novel, it is first and foremost a love story; it doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything else. At eighteen years old, citizens of the USA legally must undergo a procedure \u2013 a \u201ccure\u201d \u2013 that will result in the them being unable to love anyone ever again, whether it may be a partner, friend or family. When Alex enters her life, Lena must fight for the right to love whomever she wishes. One of the things that I didn\u2019t mention in my previous review, that really struck me about the novel, is the writing. Lauren Oliver has a talent for using the most beautiful, rich language and imagery to capture a moment perfectly. When I\u2019m reading novels, I try to picture the scenes in my head and sometimes it becomes blurry. I try to focus on it but the author hasn\u2019t provided enough detail for me to do so. Lauren Oliver is the complete opposite. She expertly describes every single scene so that the image in my head comes out crystal clear, from the description of the setting to Lena\u2019s emotions: \u201cThe water is an enormous mirror, tipped with and pink and gold from the sky. In that single, blazing moment as I came around the bend, the sun \u2013 curved over the dip of the horizon like a solid gold archway \u2013 lets out its final winking rays of light, shattering the darkness of the water, turning everything white for a fraction of a second, and then falls away, sinking, dragging the pink and the red and the purple out of the sky with it, all the colour bleeding away instantly and leaving only dark. Alex was right. It was gorgeous \u2013 one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Another thing I did not pay enough attention to before (because I was eagerly rushing trough the story) is the small fragments of society \u2013 the quotation of official documents, rules and regulations, children\u2019s songs, and poetry, which help the reader to mentally construct and imagine the world that Lauren Oliver has created. Even though the story mostly focuses on Lena and Alex\u2019s relationship and the things they discover about each other, we\u2019re constantly aware that they live in a restrictive and severely controlled society. Delirium is a wonderfully emotional, heartbreaking love story set in a dystopian future. It\u2019s both a gritty and mellow experience. If you\u2019ve not yet jumped on to the dystopian bandwagon, I\u2019d suggest that reading Delirium is a very good start indeed. \u201cLove, the deadliest of all deadly things: it kills you both when you have it and when you don\u2019t.\u201d _______________________________________________ Original February 2011 review: This book has 400 pages and I finished in less than 24 hours. That already should tell you how much I loved it. I found Delirium to be a mixture of The Hunger Games and Matched . The premise of Delirium is that this particular dystopian society sees love (or amor deliria nervosa) as a disease that needs to be cured by an operation on the brain. Lena, our protagonist, is nearly 18 years old (the age requirement for having the operation) and is nervous yet excited about her upcoming \u201cprocedure\u201d - until she meets Alex. Delirium is similar to Matched in that citizens do not have a say in who they spend the rest of their life with. The government (\u201cOfficials\u201d in Matched, \u201cRegulators\u201d in Delirium ) choose who a person is \u201cmatched\u201d with and there is no freedom of choice. However, this particular society goes even further and attempts to ensure that a person will never love again. This, according to the Regulators, will make the world a better place: everyone will be happier and safer because love is nothing but destructive. I personally found Delirium to be much more heartbreaking and emotional than Matched and the storyline took a lot less time to develop. The characters' rebellion and resistance to control (as with all dystopian novels!) begins a lot earlier in the novel and this is where the similarities to The Hunger Games begin. This is where we witness the brutality and cruelty of those in charge of these future societies. However, all three novels are fantastic in their own way and Delirium offers yet another unique look at how a dystopian society could be. It made me want to read even more dystopian literature and I did not feel like I was reading recycled material. I definitely recommend this to people who are already fans of young-adult dystopian literature. And if you haven\u2019t read it before? Do it. You\u2019ll become addicted and emotionally involved in this wonderfully exciting but terrifying genre. I cannot wait to read Pandemonium (the second novel in the series/trilogy). I\u2019m just sad that I have to wait until 2012! Thank you Hodder for sending me this book to review! Dystopian or Not Dystopian?

But where the line is drawn is when the world isn\u2019t con\u00adsis\u00adtent and in the con\u00adfines of that world, things don\u2019t make sense. That\u2019s my limit. That\u2019s when I start get\u00adting frus\u00adtrated and annoyed. And it\u2019s not because an author tried some\u00adthing new, okay? Lau\u00adren Oliver is AMAZING. She is a great author who is eru\u00addite and ver\u00adbose and inter\u00adest\u00ading to lis\u00adten to. I\u2019ve seen her speak live and frankly to an audi\u00adence and her abil\u00adity to relate to them and express her\u00adself is fantastic. But this novel still didn\u2019t work for me. Delir\u00adium, unfor\u00adtu\u00adnately, failed for me. Which is sad\u00adden\u00ading, because Lau\u00adren Oliver is a good author and I know, with Delir\u00adium, she was reach\u00ading out and try\u00ading some\u00adthing dif\u00adfer\u00adent. I just wish it had been more successful. Now, here\u2019s where it all bug\u00adgered up: 1. Incon\u00adsis\u00adtent world building. The main pro\u00adtag\u00ado\u00adnist says the word \u201clove\u201d twice. Once in con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtion and the sec\u00adond time men\u00adtally. Love is a con\u00adcept that\u2019s stig\u00adma\u00adtized to such an extreme degree that even the whis\u00adpered word \u201csym\u00adpa\u00adthizer\u201d is ver\u00adboten. Yet the main pro\u00adtag\u00ado\u00adnist SAYS it to her aunt \u2013 that she LOVES chil\u00addren. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. And she\u2019s wan\u00adder\u00ading around with Alex and mak\u00ading out with him in pub\u00adlic like the con\u00adse\u00adquence for that is a slap on the wrist. Look, she lives in a highly auto\u00adcratic world where even a hint of the dis\u00adease will land you in prison \u2013 and she makes out with her boyfriend in the mid\u00addle of pub\u00adlic places. 2. Char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adi\u00adza\u00adtion. I loved the char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adi\u00adza\u00adtion of Lena. I thought it was accu\u00adrate and real\u00adis\u00adtic. It\u2019s the char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adi\u00adza\u00adtion of Alex that left me hol\u00adlow and empty. He felt like a place-holder. Sim\u00adply a text\u00adbook demon\u00adstra\u00adtion of today\u2019s YA expec\u00adta\u00adtions of a love inter\u00adest. Devoted, stalk\u00ader\u00adish, sad back story. Oliver\u2019s love inter\u00adest in Before I Fall was so much more dynamic even though he com\u00adprised a rel\u00ada\u00adtively small part in the story. Alex felt like a def\u00adi\u00adn\u00adi\u00adtion of desir\u00adable love inter\u00adest instead of actu\u00adally being a per\u00adson Lena fell in love with. 3. Writ\u00ading. I never thought I\u2019d say this because, in my mind, Oliver is \u2013 and always will be \u2013 a fan\u00adtas\u00adtic writer. But there were aspects of the writ\u00ading in this book that were obvi\u00adous, cliche and sim\u00adplis\u00adtic. For exam\u00adple, Lena is emo\u00adtion\u00adally stunted but it\u2019s an obvi\u00adous par\u00adal\u00adlel. When\u00adever she feels intense emo\u00adtion she blames it on the air con\u00addi\u00adtion\u00ading or weather etc. She is the result of a child\u00adhood of emo\u00adtional detach\u00adment \u2013 but not really \u2013 and this is where it gets per\u00adsonal for me. Because, if you don\u2019t reli\u00adgiously read my reviews, then you wouldn\u2019t know that my son was almost diag\u00adnosed with Attach\u00adment Dis\u00ador\u00adder. Because when my first son was born, I was one of those weird reli\u00adgious peo\u00adple that ascribed to books like Baby Wise, etc. For the first six months of his life, he barely looked at me in the eye. Attach\u00adment dis\u00ador\u00adder babies are those that, from their infancy, do not expe\u00adri\u00adence con\u00adsis\u00adtent, lov\u00ading care. They are chil\u00addren that learn, early on, that they are not truly loved and this results in a wide swath of behav\u00adioral and emo\u00adtional problems. Lena is the result of a child\u00adhood that had a mother who loves her and responded accord\u00adingly to her needs, but other chil\u00addren in the soci\u00adety didn\u2019t receive this \u2013 some\u00adthing that I felt was a huge cope-out. What about the char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adi\u00adza\u00adtion of a per\u00adson who wasn\u2019t loved? Who was a prod\u00aduct of the sys\u00adtem? I feel like this wasn\u2019t exam\u00adined enough \u2013 wasn\u2019t inspected enough. Like it was han\u00addled by some\u00adone who just assumed that chil\u00addren would still reflect some mod\u00adicum of nor\u00admal\u00adity after being raised in a world where they aren\u2019t being lov\u00adingly raised by peo\u00adple prop\u00aderly attached to them. And the assump\u00adtion that you can have attach\u00adment with\u00adout love \u2013 it\u2019s mind bog\u00adgling because I kind of feel like she was out of her depth on this one. It\u2019s not Oliver\u2019s fault. But what I wanted from this is a deeper under\u00adstand\u00ading of soci\u00adety from the point of view of some\u00adone will\u00ading to delve into a harder, grit\u00adtier, more real\u00adis\u00adtic story. Some\u00adone will\u00ading to ask the tough ques\u00adtions and write the tough char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adi\u00adza\u00adtion. Instead the novel glosses over a lot of those things and thus felt cheap and shallow.

But I was so very, very excited for this that I think I was even more let down by it than Matched, which was also something I was eager for.\u00a0 Before I Fall was fresh and compelling, and I felt like so much of Oliver, so much heart and so much work, went into it.\u00a0 I didn't feel the same about Delirium.\u00a0 I'm not going to accuse Oliver of selling out or hopping on a trend, but I do wonder how much passion was behind this story.\u00a0 It seemed sort of sloppy (and yes, I know, I read an ARC, and that may account for some of it).\u00a0 But there were so many inconsistencies and questions I had that I couldn't ever commit.\u00a0 I could only go along so far until logic would intrude.\u00a0 I would be forced to ask myself things like, If Lena was just bitten (badly) in the leg by a dog, why does Alex kissing her seem to erase not only any pain, but even any mention of the bite, until it's like an afterthought?\u00a0 How does her family not notice that either a) she's wearing pants in the middle of sweltering August, and limping, or b) she's not wearing pants and the scar is showing and she's limping?\u00a0 Because it has to be one of those 2 things.\u00a0 And though the \"cure\" may not make them care for her safety so much, it doesn't take away their suspicious natures.\u00a0 [Also, setting aside the fact that she walked home, how did they just walk home ?\u00a0 Just like that.\u00a0 With raiding parties everywhere, and her bitten terribly, they just strolled on home, illegally, down the street?\u00a0 How do they get away with all the shit they get away with, in this repressive society?\u00a0 Hmm...] Things like this were peppered throughout the story, and they just made it nearly impossible to buy in to what was going on. Smaller things, too, like words and phrases and things we have now that I don't see any use for, or don't believably buy would be in the world Oliver created.\u00a0 And, of course, the much bigger things, like how did all this -- the discovery of the \"deliria\", the cure, the restrictions, the beliefs, all of it -- come to be?\u00a0 I know it may not be what Lauren intended, but with such a seemingly science-influenced dystopia, I need some good scientific reasoning, some \"evidence\" -- real or gov't created -- that backs everything up, some explanation or plausible scenario that lets this total overhaul of human beliefs and passions come to be in a matter of 60 years or so.\u00a0 That's a very, VERY brief period of time for such a huge and total change to take place, so I need reality to intrude a little.\u00a0 I need either some hints of a really big conspiracy, or something so huge and devastating that people as a whole almost go into a state of shock or numbness that allows this to happen.\u00a0 Because, as a general rule, people don't willingly submit to mass lobotomies or the eradication of their feelings for the people they love -- or hate -- without some serious something acting as a catalyst.\u00a0 Petty strife and crimes of passion may make you think of Eternal Sunshining your mind spotless, but in an abstract, angry, wouldn't-it-be-lovely kind of way, and not a bring-on-the-procedure kind of way.\u00a0 Some science, some history, some dogma, some thing beyond the sometimes eerie, sometimes meh snippets of \"texts\" that start every chapter, would have gone a long way toward helping me willingly suspend my disbelief. But even if I could have set the worldbuilding and believability aside -- no easy task in a concept novel like this -- for it to be saved, the characters and plot would have had to really shine. But I felt like everything was a little wooden, a little cardboard, a little less than believable and real.\u00a0 The love interest, Alex, was okay enough, but why should Lena care about him, and why should I?\u00a0 I understand why he cares about Lena, but that's not something we really find out until Lena is already head over heels infected/in love, and I don't understand how she got there.\u00a0 As a reader, in order to take that leap with a character, we need to know why, we need to feel it.\u00a0 All I got was that he was a boy who payed attention to her, he winked, he smiled, he seemed a bit smarmy and she's hooked.\u00a0 Now, yes, I get that's enough for a teenage infatuation, and it may be heightened by the taboo nature of it.\u00a0 I even get that his more easy manner reminded Lena of her mother, who was incurable. But for Lena, who has always been terrified of the deliria, which tore her world apart, and who has always looked forward to her procedure, and been so afraid of stepping out of the box, who is afraid to say, to even hear , the word love -- for her to completely flip and become reckless and passionate and all the other stuff that comes with being the things she's always feared...hmm.\u00a0 The only way this really works for me, the only thing that would make me buy it and appreciate it, was if it took the slant that the deliria was real and she'd become infected.\u00a0 Otherwise, I have no choice but to think this is a cheesy, run of the mill YA romance where one look from a guy makes a girl throw her entire being out the window and become a swooning, fluttery mess with no relation to the person she once was, and who would die for the roguish boy she knows nothing about.\u00a0 Which is, apparently, what every teenage girl is secretly waiting to do. Maybe the deliria is real. Reviewed December 19th, 2010 ...more 2 / 5 Dystopian fiction, particularly the young adult kind, is plummeting downhill at 100 mile-an-hour.

You have been warned. And for anyone who did not read this warning in time, you are more than welcome to join my sleep-deprived sob fest. If only I knew what I was getting myself into when I first picked up the book. For the past sixty-four years, love was considered a disease which impaired reason and posed a threat to society. A cure was established to protect United States citizens from the debilitating effects of the illness. At the age of 18, each person is required to undergo a procedure, permanently curing them from the sickness. The story follows 18-year-old Lena Haloway, who grew up in Portland, Maine with her aunt and uncle. Lena anxiously counts down the days until her procedure, anticipating the moment she can join the other \"cureds\" with excitement. This excitement quickly fades as Lena herself succumbs to the disease, becoming hopelessly entangled in a forbidden romance. I have to admire Oliver for the creative spin she placed on American society when establishing this dystopian world. She managed to create a plausible universe in which love had been almost completely eradicated. I felt a pang of sorrow each time Oliver highlighted the emotionless shell of a community in which parents exhibited no compassion for their children and married couples exchanged no signs of affection for one another. Such examples reveal the underlying theme: a life without love is not worth living. More importantly, Oliver's writing was flawless. She vividly described each scene, allowing readers to visualise each event as it occurred. Through her writing, Oliver also evokes a vast array of emotions from her readers. When Lena is enraged, readers are fuming. When she breaks down, crying hysterically, readers are right there, sobbing along with her. Her feelings of love, betrayal, and loss transcend all boundaries, lodging themselves in the hearts of readers around the world. Lena's characterization, although less than stellar at times, does have its perks. Above all, Lena treasures her family and friends. She is terrified at the thought of losing her best friend, Hana, after her procedure. Lena, like the rest of society, was convinced that love was dangerous and potentially life threatening. After experiencing the effects of the disease firsthand, she comes to the startling realization that love is harmless. Lena was determined to discover the truth, no matter how heartbreaking the truth may be. On the other hand, Lena is not the epitome of perfection - no properly characterized protagonist should be. She struggles to move on from her past, particularly her mother's suicide. Her mother gave up her life for the ones she loved, and Lena is more than willing to do the same. But she continues to visualize her mother leaping from a cliff and slowly falling into the tumultuous waters below (a rather frequently mentioned event throughout the book). Additionally, Lena compares herself to a princess who is waiting for her prince to save her. Yes, she outright states this comparison and is not ashamed to do so. Unfortunately, the concept of a damsel in distress does not appeal to the majority of teens in this day and age, myself included. They would prefer to read about a strong, independent, female protagonist who does not rely on others to come to her rescue. I think we've all outgrown Disney movies at this point. Lastly, there was the slightly overwhelming ending that left me shaking and speechless. My mother was only slightly concerned when she found me sitting on the floor, rocking back and forth and suffering from mild shock. To avoid giving away the ending, let's just say it was ... unexpected. Life changing. Devastating. Shall I continue, or let you form your own opinion? \"Love, the deadliest of all deadly things: It kills you both when you have it and when you don't.\" ...more This has all the elements of being a very exciting story, but sad to say, it isn't.

The storyline isn't bad, but it's far too minutely descriptive and all I can think is, well, this is going to be stretched out to fill three books so, of course, it's overly descriptive. Something has to fill all those pages. Too bad it isn't the story, but street by street bicycling and walking or running. And the sights and smells over and over and over. There are some things that are described in almost the same way several times. This is unneccessary. And while we're on the subject of unneccessary, I know that Lena is five foot, two. I got that the first time I was told and it didn't need repetition. It was not in need of repetition. Or to put it a little differently while still giving you the same information again: it didn't need repeating. This whole story could have been tightened up and more than likely the whole proposed three installments would fit within the pages of one book. I get it, I really do. Why write one book when you can hook readers into three? I mean, it's three sales, three times the money, so kudos to the author on that, but the story really needs to be strong enough to make readers keep coming back for more. And, as usual, it ends on something of a cliff-hanger so, as a reader, I'm left disappointed. However, there are things that I really liked about the story and for which I applaud Lauren Oliver and which make me think she's capable of better than what's here. The chapter headings with quotes from The Book of SHHH , nursery rhymes, playground chants, Comprehensive Compilation of Dangerous Words and Ideas , government pamphlets, schoolbooks and others are simply brilliant and add to the story in subtle ways. Amor Deliria Nervosa sounds like what doctors might call love if they wanted to classify it as a disease. There are lots of little tidbits like this that are clever and creative and make me wish for more from this book. I also really like that she put in that indifference, not hate, is the opposite of love. It's a thoughtful small conversation, but it is also the basis of the story. The government has decided that they prefer the people to be indifferent, uncaring, and I think that actually is rather profound. I did like the characters. I've heard the complaint that Lena has no personality and I think that's true, but she lives in a society that having no personality is considered a good thing. No one is encouraged to be different or have interests or feel passionate about anything so the fact that she's fairly unformed makes sense for the world she lives in. When she finally makes her choices, her life opens up and she finds a strength in herself. The character of Alex is well-drawn and his attraction to her makes sense. I liked them together. One of the problems with the writing of the book is that the first few chapters introduce lots of characters and backstory and it's kind of a lot to slog through. And yet, even with all of that, too much isn't fully explained or developed. How did they come up with the idea that love is a disease? The action really doesn't pick up until the final hundred pages and then there are some surprises, but by that time I was already a bit bored. Additionally, there are some continuity errors. When things like this happen, it stops the story for me. I have to go back and reference the information. In a book that repeats itself as much as this one does, you'd think it would be easy to keep the facts straight. For instance, Lena lives in a two-story house except that at one time she thinks that her aunt and uncle's whole apartment would fit in the living room of a house she's in. Or she's playing in the ocean with Alex and it says how her shoes are filled with water several times, but she had kicked her shoes off when she got to the beach and she grabs them up to put back on when she runs out of the water. That was within a few pages so it should have been easy to keep that straight. The most flagrant one was the time left until Lena's cure which skips all around. When it's down to just seventeen days, her aunt says it's several weeks away. Seventeen days is two and a half weeks, not several. Small things, I know, but it interrupted the flow of a story which was already dragging and not flowing well. I think it would have made for a much more interesting dynamic and Lena's choice would have been more dramatic had her paired boy been someone as good as or close to as good as Alex. Instead we get this short guy who is snotty (literally, he has allergies to everything, so he's full of snot), listless and unattractive to Lena. It would have added some tenson if he had been a possible choice, someone with whom she could at least be content. Not that I'm suggesting a love triangle, not at all, oh no, but I think her pair being someone less repulsive (not that short guys are repulsive, but the mucus factor...) would have made her choice more of a choice instead of making it seem to be the only possible choice. In this world you can be executed for breaking the rules and yet, Lena does so almost every day after she meets Alex. At one point they are walking down the street together on opposite sides of the sidewalk to make it appear they aren't walking together. Um, how big exactly is this sidewalk? If I saw two people walking along side by side, I'd assume they are together, even if they are walking on opposite sides. I had to read this over because I thought it was opposite sides of the street, but nope, sidewalk in broad daylight. This made no sense to me. Last, but not least, the motorcycle. While I do love me some hero riding in on a white horse or, in place of that, a shiny motorcycle, there needs to be at least a bit of dialogue on how this happened. How about, \"Where did you get this?\" shouted over the sound of the engine with, \"Stole it!\" as a reply. At least give me this much or earlier in the book tell me he has a motorcyle. This came out of nowhere, almost a deus ex machina or, in this case, deus ex motorcycle. All in all, not a bad read, not the best. Will I read the next books? *frustrated sigh* Probably. ...more Such a good book. I loved the whole idea of the world even though I found it depressing. It was such a unique concept. There were times when I found myself being annoyed with Lena. I kept thinking to myself \"Lena, shut up.\", but I grew to really like her character towards the end.

Honestly, I hated Lena for most of the book. She's so damn weak and I couldn't help but think that Hana would have been a much better heroine. I still partially feel that way, because Lena's character doesn't really fit in with the whole rebellion scenario, but I guess that's the entire point. I really do hope Lena grows a backbone in Pandemonium though, one on her own, without the help of Alex and Hana. And Alex...I like to think of him as an alternate version of Kent from Before I Fall . I loved the latter so so much, but there wasn't enough of him in BIF, so I liked pretending Alex was actually Kent in spirit. I'm deluded, I know. And like I felt with Lena, I didn't geniunely like Alex. He's great as far as heroes go, but a little too perfect. I would have continued like that for the rest of the series, I believe, had the ending not happened the way it did. But since it did happen that way, it made me view the guy as more than just some tasty fictional candy. I know in my head that (view spoiler) [he can't actually be dead (hide spoiler) ] but my heart still cries over the possibility. Off to read Pandemonium now.

There were two factors, that made me do it, though: I had been very impressed by the author's courageous debut Before I Fall and the emotions reading it exposed me to. And - like almost every YA book lover out here - I am on the lookout for great dystopian fiction. Since I have consumed several representatives of that species which simply weren't worth the time I concluded that one by an author whose earlier work I admired should be a safe choice. Yes, although I did not have fixed expectations concerning the story or the setting, I did have certain anticipations concerning the havoc Ms Oliver would wreak in my mind. After turning a quarter of the pages I am still waiting for my heart to contract, for my mind to reel, for my conscience to have difficulties in taking sides. Instead, I am getting a little bored, since I cannot detect something really new, and the only effort my mind is making (I feel brain-amputated, too, because I cannot love a book I am supposed to love) is to evaluate, whether the teenage heroine Magdalena\u2019s calmness and adaptiveness and believe in the system are realistic or not. (A few weeks ago I watched a documentary about the importance of an infant\u2019s first year for its intellectual and emotional development. Research shows that the exaggerated, fond conversation parents have with their babies \u2013 all that positive grimacing and cooing and constant contact-keeping - is so very crucial. Babies who were cared for by parents suffering severe depressions who kept blank faces and did not interact much with their infants, quickly stopped searching for emotional responses in their parents\u2019 faces and were diagnosed as having notable developmental delays later.) Magdalena is one of the rare kids who was cuddled, comforted and loved in secret by her mom. Therefore, in my opinion, she should have more urges to have emotional outbursts than to painfully follow the rules. But I am not sure. Maybe her story is realistic the way it is depicted. What is is not : Riveting or shocking or frightening like, for instance, the film Equilibrium , which really shows a controlled and altered society, the consequences of the cropped ability to feel. I think even without the visuals Equilibrium as a book would have sent me into a turmoil a hundred times stronger than Delirium. It is also not as well explained, as skillfully multi-layered, and as intricately shown from an inside-angle as The Giver by Lois Lowry, although the latter has a lot less pages to make the situation stomach-wrenchingly uncomfortable and eerie to the reader. And last it is not as exciting as the Uglies Series by Scott Westerfeld, which offers a setting that does not differ so much from \u201eDelirium\u201c: Authorities dealt with the human faults that led to a global catastrophe by turning everybody over 15 into pretty, rather dumb and peaceful people, who mind their jobs, meet their kids now and then and are content with partying and working. Like Lena Tally looks forward to her transformation - in her case from ugly to pretty - , to her move into the pretties\u2019 dormitory ... until her best friend starts to install doubts into her mind. And ... whoosh ... the reader is drawn into a breathless thrill-ride that lasts three volumes and makes countless unexpected turns. I flipped through the remaining three quarters of \u201eDelirium\u201c and \u2013 as well as I can judge by catching a phrase here and there \u2013 the road to the cliffy ending seems to be pretty straight and allows time for picking pretty flowers on the way. So. That was the explanation for my taking the next exit and grabbing the next book on my pile. I think, I\u2019ll go for a historical romance \u2013 highly unusual for me. I advise the still undecided to read either The Giver , the Uglies or both and to watch Equilibrium .

It is chock full of phrases that you want to memorize and save for one of those moments when a loved one is going through a hard time, then lay it on them and take full credit for it. (I'd never do that, but it's tempting!) This storyline was unsettling and tragic, with the aversion to love and the treatment of it as if it's a disease--amor deliria nervosa.I couldn't imagine a life without love, nor would I want to. But reading about it makes for an exhilarating experience. Oliver's creation of this world where the United States will basically lay the smackdown on anyone who is in love. The word \"despair\" is prominent in my mind when thinking about the tone of Delirium. It was very, very sad. It took awhile for Lena to grow on me. I get it, she's just doing what she knows she's supposed to. She's following the rules and staying on the straight and narrow path to the final destination of having that lovin' feeling sucked out of her brain, thanks to The Cure (\"Love Song\" may or may not have played in my head every time I read those words.) I fell in love with her voice once she started to see things for what they really were. And then there's Alex. Oh man. All it took was that ONE WORD (which you'll understand once you read it) and I was hooked. Alex reminded me a lot of Ewan McGregor's character in Moulin Rouge, going on about freedom, beauty, truth, and love in his dreamy fashion. I was in quite a pickle once I met Alex. It was a constant struggle between savoring every single word that Oliver penned and flipping ahead to ANY page where Alex's name was present and devouring the deliciousness. I loved his strength and his outlook, and I loved Alex and Lena together. The dynamic of their relationship made my heart explode. Delirium is an incredible, AMAZING love story. I can't think of a situation where the lovers are MORE star-crossed than this. Dude. They're going to literally remove the ability to love from her BRAIN. See, I'd tell you to prepare yourself for this massive cliffhanger ending, but it's just not possible. This ending ruined me. I felt like sometime gave me a swift punch to the gut when I turned that last page. I think I flipped forward, hoping that past all the blank pages, there'd be some Comic Sans text saying \"JUST KIDDING!\" and then some explanation or some SEMBLANCE of resolution to hold me over until frickin' 2012 when Pandemonium comes out.

Lena Haloway grew up looking forward to the day that she will be cured. She believed that undergoing the procedure would make her happy, and save her from the pain that her mother and her older sister went through when they were infected with the Amor Deliria Nervosa , what we commonly call \u2018love\u2019. But everything changed when a ruckus, involving cows in wigs and dresses, occurred during her evaluation. She lifted her eyes and met his. Nothing was ever the same for Lena ever since. Okay, maybe that was not the best overview of the book, but let me tell you this: Delirium is going to open up the floodgates of your hearts; you won\u2019t be able to stop it. When I started rereading this, I was surprised by the fact that there was so much I have forgotten about its story. It was as if my brain blotted out all the exciting details so I could fully enjoy it again. The truth is I have enjoyed it more this time. The world that Lauren Oliver built was a thought-provoking one. It made me appreciate more what we have now: love. She was able to write down a possible future if people started to be swallowed up by their own fears of pain and instability. It reminded me of something that I\u2019ve read about advertising, that people create product infomercials with the thought of showing people what could dismay them, with an immediate solution attached to it. That\u2019s what I saw with the government and the laws in Delirium. It showed their nation the terrible effects of love and the nightmares that could happen if they ever indulged to it. Their leaders offered false security, trapping them in what I\u2019d like to call a \u201csafe zone\u201d, limiting themselves with promises of order and happiness. I honestly think that this system could happen to us. If people keep feeling disappointed, if others keep making them see themselves as failures, someone might just make this our new reality. My emotions became more intense as I understood more each of the characters and saw how each of them was fighting their own battles. I want to talk about the three that stood out the most for me due to their choices and perspective on the matters they were dealing with. Let me start with Lena. Lena, our protagonist exquisitely changed from who she was at the beginning of the book. Her eyes and her heart opened up to the things she never saw before. She realized all the lies of her world that the government had founded on fear. I love that at first she was very hesitant to believe what the Invalids, resisters, and sympathizers were fighting for. She was very stubborn and would fight for what she knew in herself was right, for the things that the laws have instilled in them. In the end, I found that she became a very strong character, which reminds me that I should add her to my list of female protagonists. She\u2019s become very admirable, willing to brave anything just so she could fight for the freedom and the love that she now has in her. Lena\u2019s family background was something that readers should take note of. It was one of the aspects of the story that gripped my heart the tightest. It was heartbreaking every time she reminisced their memories together when she was younger, most especially those when Rachel, her older sister, was still uncured. There was a huge difference between her life then and the one she had after the tragedy that destroyed her family. \u201dHis hair is a crown of leaves, of thorns, of flames. His eyes are blazing with light, more light than all the lights in every city in the whole world, more light than we could ever invent if we had ten thousand billion years. Alex, Lena\u2019s love interest, though I found his character very flat, he has been Lena\u2019s driving force in her constant development as a person. Because of him and his knowledge of the cure\u2019s corrupt nature, he was able to turn things around, pushing Lena out of her comfort zone. I admire him for being patient with Lena and for being very careful when it comes to their plans for the two of them. Both of their lives could be compromised, but Alex was never afraid as long as he could give Lena the love that he thinks she deserved. For him, it was the only thing that mattered and nothing else. Next, I would like to talk about Hana, Lena\u2019s bestfriend. Hana is Lena\u2019s complete opposite but they were always there for each other. She was adventurous and rebellious, the popular girl who had everything, but still acted like she had nothing to lose. Lena cared so much for her. They were drifting apart at some points of the story, and then turning back to each other after a while. As Hana was coming closer to her deadline, counting down the days until their procedures, Lena was starting to feel boundless. It felt like Hana, who was free at the beginning was slowly walking towards a cage while Lena was on her way out. The ending was very pleasing and there is no better way of executing it. It was action-packed and extremely dangerous. Lena shed her old self and was reborn when she took that slim chance, paying the price for a new and better life. I utterly adore Lauren Oliver\u2019s writing. Her words are easily-flowing like stream or rushing water down the falls. I could decorate my room with the beauty of her words. I could listen to them all day, even if it\u2019s just about describing Alex\u2019s hair. But I noticed in this installment the overuse of the words suck, sucking, sucked, and all the other forms of that word. Yes, I can\u2019t help but notice that she used it to describe a number of things in the book, inserting them in her figures of speech like building blocks to a house. Even though she could have replaced them with other words, I still highly delighted in her work, for she painted the most stunning images in my mind, letting me see them in full color and detail. I\u2019m giving this a 4-star rating instead of a 5 because of only one reason: there were some parts that bored me. But I understand that he pacing felt a bit slow at some point because the story focused more on Lena\u2019s metamorphosis emotionally and the transformation of her beliefs. It was carefully done like she was metal tested through fire and turned to a sharp-edged sword. Overall, I highly recommend this. If you\u2019re looking for a book that would make you think and feel, pick this one up. You won\u2019t regret it. \u201cYou can build walls all the way to the sky and I will find a way to fly above them. You can try to pin me down with a hundred thousand arms, but I will find a way to resist. And there are many of us out there, more than you think. People who refuse to stop believing. People who refuse to come to earth. People who love in a world without walls, people who love into hate, into refusal, against hope, and without fear.\u201d ...more Let\u2019s all gather round and pretend that Lauren Oliver is a surgeon.

They cannot take it\" \"You can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes\" \"Love: It will kill you and save you, both\" \"The most dangerous sicknesses are those that make us believe we are well\" \"It's so strange how life works: You want something and you wait and wait and feel like it's taking forever to come. Then it happens and it's over and all you want to do is curl back up in that moment before things changed.\" ...more Yet another example of why I hate dystopia. Same old, same old.

To be honest, it was difficult to place myself in Lena's world. It just seemed so...far fetched. Maybe it's because every time I think if a dystopian society, I think of Katniss and The Hunger Games. If you are looking for something like The Hunger Games, this is is not it. Delirium focuses more on Lena and Alex's relationship than the actual world. Maybe that's why I felt it hard to believe. I don't know. I feel that the first half of the book was rather bland to me. It didn't really start getting interesting until after the climax. And that is an awful lot of pages to keep me waiting. I really did enjoy the book tho. It was beautifully written, especially the prose in the beginning of each chapter. While I don't think it it is as good as Before I Fall, I will read the sequel because c'mon Lauren Oliver, that ending was just harsh! Lol.

Beautiful, yes, but that does not do it justice. I was mesmerized from the beginning. This book tugged at my heart and left me breathless. The ending left me speechless. I could fill this entire page with quotes from Delirium due to Lauren Oliver\u2019s lovely poetic writing. \u201cLove: a single word, a wispy thing, a word no bigger or longer than an edge. That's what it is: an edge; a razor. It draws up through the center of your life, cutting everything in two. Before and after. The rest of the world falls away on either side.\u201d A dystopian world that believes love, or as it has come to be called \u2018amor deliria nervosa\u2019, is a dangerous deadly disease. There is, however, a cure for the disease. Scientists have found a way to render the part of the brain that makes you feel love inactive. Of course, it also takes away the ability to feel compassion, sympathy, sensitivity, and at times, I felt, humanity. Not only does this affect young people who may have fallen in love, but the way one would feel about a friend, family member\u2026 even your own child. These are disregarded simply as side affects - a much better alternative than falling prey to the disease. When the youth of Portland turn 18, the procedure can be administered. Some embrace it\u2026. Others don\u2019t. What happens if you are one who doesn\u2019t? \"I'd rather die my way than live yours.\" The story follows 17 year old Lena, who lives in fear of the disease and cannot wait to have her procedure administered so that she may be cured. She can feel the disease in her blood, and for her it is unbearable. She is counting down the days until she can be cleansed and free from the worry of ever contracting the deliria. Then she meets Alex. \"As soon as I look up, his eyes click onto my face. The breath whooshes out of my body and everything freezes for a second, as though I am looking at him through my camera lens, zoomed in all the way, the world pausing for that tiny span of time between the opening and closing of the shutter.\" Alex is a beautiful soul with an intriguing and heartbreaking story. Not only is he strong, confident, and brave, but he is gentle and tender. He quotes poetry. Mind you not just any poetry\u2026 Elizabeth Barrett Browning, my personal favorite. While this is a wonderful, tumultuous, and exciting love story, for me this book was about sacrifice - Ultimate sacrifice. Lena\u2019s relationship with her mother and her mother\u2019s story was poignant, at times heart wrenching, and enormously gripping. \"I love you. Remember. They cannot take it\". While I love YA books, especially dystopian futures, some can leave me with a bit of a let down. Sure, there is romance, or more like of a hint of romance, and that leaves me feeling frustrated. Delirium is an exception. This was one of the most romantic YA books I have read to date. \"I hate skin; I hate bones and bodies. I want to curl up inside of him and be carried there forever.\" And the ending? A cliffhanger of epic proportions. It will definitely be a book to treasure and savor for quite some time. Delirium is easily one of my top five favorites. I am more than ready for the next book in this trilogy. \u201cLove. It kills you both when you have it, and when you don\u2019t.\u201d ...more 2.5 stars Lena and Alex, if this is true love you\u2019re selling \u2013 I\u2019m afraid that I am just not buying it.

The issues that prevented me from wholly enjoying Delirium 2.5 stars Lena and Alex, if this is true love you\u2019re selling \u2013 I\u2019m afraid that I am just not buying it.

Our protagonists, an \u201cuncured\u201d and an \u201cinvalid\u201d respectively, create the crux of the story when they commit the unthinkable, and \u201cfall in love\u201d. The issues that prevented me from wholly enjoying Delirium are twofold. First, as mentioned above: the love story. I have some issues with the way love is presented in this book. Of course, this is highly subjective and largely based on my personal thoughts and opinions \u2013 but the portrayal of love in Delirium threw cold water in the face of any potential I had to really dig this book. I found the relationship between Alex and Lena to be much too overwrought and overblown for me to really get behind it. Regardless of the genre I happen to be reading, what draws me to a relationship between characters is generally the thread of truth, or relatability, that runs through it. I like some swoon and sweeping gestures and touching declarations as much as the next person \u2013 but it still needs to feel real to me, born out of some genuine chemistry and depth. I didn\u2019t find this in Delirium. I found the relationship to be fairly one-note and formulaic, relying on all too familiar \u201cteen love\u201d tropes. Did I believe they were infatuated with each other? Absolutely, based on the physical symptoms described at length in the book. In lust? Probably. In love? Not so much. This element of the story, basically the foundation on which the plot stands, felt hollow to me. I felt that I was expected to believe in their love, as if the book were telling me: \u201cThis is story about a world without love. Therefore, you will sympathise with the characters who fall in love. And now here is your obligatory reference to Romeo & Juliet.\" Um, I\u2019m afraid not. I still need a reason to believe in their connection. (view spoiler) [As in, a reason beyond unleashing cattle in a government building and some surreptitious winking. (hide spoiler) ] Secondly: the premise. Honestly, the idea did appeal to me \u2013 it is an intriguing concept after all, creating a world where a whole section of the human spectrum of emotion is removed - but essentially, I felt that this world was built out of balsa wood. It had all the appearance of an interesting and complex system, but it doesn\u2019t bear any substantial weight and turns into a pile of splinters under a little serious contemplation. Further, I simply didn\u2019t feel that the premise was strong enough to carry 400 pages. At times, the story felt elongated beyond what it could realistically bear, filled out with pages of heady, descriptive prose. Which leads to me to what I did like about Delirium, or rather what I thought was the book\u2019s strongest point, which is Oliver\u2019s writing. While I did find sections drawn out, I do think that Oliver wields some considerable skill with her prose. It\u2019s certainly not to all tastes (nothing is, right?), but I\u2019m not averse to her poetic style, and there is a certain languid rhythm to the passages and the flow of words. I feel that there was potential here that largely went untapped. Had the characters been stronger, had their relationship been more developed and nuanced so that I cared about it more, had the setting induced the chilling panopticon-like vibe I was expecting (if this book is going to be labelled as dystopian, which is a subject for another day..) \u2013 I think I would have liked this book so much more. In the end, Delirium felt like a very pretty package, with some interesting ideas on the surface, but I was left feeling disappointed with the contents. ...more While the dystopian YA craze has been heavily promoted and much talked about this year, it has arguably not met the extremely high expectations placed upon it by publishers and readers.

It\u2019s also worth noting that all three books were arguably the most heavily publicised dystopian YAs of the year. \u201cDelirium\u201d also comes with the added bonuses of being a new book from an author with much critical acclaim for her first book, \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d (which I haven\u2019t read) as well as a heavily promoted romantic angle, which has proven popular. For me, a dystopian novel rises and falls on its world building and the atmosphere the society within the novel evokes. I always associate a great dystopia with fear, paranoia, confusion, a constant sense of foreboding. Unfortunately, \u201cDelirium\u201d gave me none of this, but with the basic premise being such a bewildering one, it\u2019s not hard to see why. The front cover of the book asks \u201cWhat if love were a disease?\u201d And immediately, I ask questions. I can understand a dystopian society where emotions have been suppressed and declared dangerous. Lois Lowry executed that premise with particular skill in \u201cThe Giver.\u201d However, the idea that of all the emotions in the world that could be considered the most dangerous to our world, the ones that cause the most damage and war, love is the worst is just confusing to me. What about greed? Anger? Fear? The book does little to expand upon the dangers of love, and the pseudo-science we are given does little to convince. Add to that the sheer number of plot holes and it was difficult to completely immerse oneself in this world. I started asking questions on the 2nd page. Why is the procedure to cure one of the symptoms of love ineffective to the under 18s? Why are uncured boys and girls kept separate but it\u2019s okay for Lena, our incredibly passive and dull heroine, to associate with a cured man? Did nobody stop to think that raising children who are capable of love with parents who are not was a bad idea? If segregating the sexes is supposed to prevent early onset love then what about gay boys and girls? Why is it so easy for uncured citizens to pass themselves off as cured? Surely there would be more rigorous testing or such. These aren\u2019t even all the questions I found myself asking throughout the course of the book. The world itself is also very sloppily built and does not evoke the emotions of fear that Oliver intends it to. For a society that\u2019s supposed to be rigorously guarded and watching its citizens at all times, it\u2019s pathetically easy for characters to go to secret parties, to sneak into the forbidden areas, to let animals into government buildings. While Oliver does use an interesting narrative device in having each chapter start with an excerpt from the fictional literature of the book\u2019s world, they do little to evoke what this society is really like. On top of all this, we\u2019re never given any real history behind the USA\u2019s decision to implement this ban on love. There\u2019s no moment given to us where, for example, a civil war of sorts was declared between love and non love (anyone else hearing songs from \u201cHair\u201d in their head?) to justify this change in power. With \u201c1984\u201d, Big Brother was always watching you. In \u201cDelirium\u201d things are decidedly more meh-ish. The best dystopians, although not all of them, take something from our world and take it to its worst conclusion, a cautionary tale of sorts. I could imagine the USA implementing an authoritarian, anti-woman society like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d. I could imagine a mass government takeover founded in an extremely fringe religious movement. I can\u2019t imagine love being declared a disease. As expected with a book based on the idea of discovering one\u2019s own awareness of love and the emotion itself in action, our heroine Lena has moments of extreme melodrama. While these moments would be understandable had her society and plight been more believable, here I was just left cold. None of the other characters really stood out in any way for me. The love interest Alex was particularly bland, once again another amalgam of every YA romance male love interest I\u2019ve ever read; a bit of a jerk, constantly saving Lena, reciting love poetry, never going beyond surface detail with the romance. For a book that relies so heavily on the idea that true love is something so wonderful that it\u2019s worth risking your life for, I never thought of Lena and Alex\u2019s romance as anything more than teenage necking. Of course, it was also tough for me to sympathise with the pair when they wax lyrical about how romantic and beautiful a love story \u201cRomeo & Juliet\u201d is. Yes, this is another YA novel that completely misreads and oversimplifies the famous play, but it\u2019s made even worse by the evil, love hating society decreeing it to be a cautionary tale, which it is, but of course Lena and Alex know the truth. While I give Oliver credit for not completely following the well worn path of YA romance, for the most part their relationship is everything one would expect from such a book. Oliver\u2019s real strength lies in her prose. It\u2019s well structured and very purposeful. I got the feeling that, had Oliver had a stronger story and characters, this book would have been much more effective. As it is, \u201cDelirium\u201d is a long, confusing and often very dull read. I don\u2019t think the premise is a completely terrible one but it\u2019s one that requires very deep analysis and a meticulously thought out society to build upon it. Strong prose will only go so far when it\u2019s trying to keep sloppy world building, a tough premise and weak characters afloat. In the end, \u201cDelirium\u201d left me with far too many questions and not enough satisfaction. 2/5. ...more Bueno, claramente los di\u00e1logos no son el fuerte de la autora; son pocos aquellos donde logra juntar m\u00e1s de cuatro palabras.

Pardon me while I throw up my hands and despair yet again at why people insist on having main characters whom everyone else considers special and strong, but really isn\u2019t \u2026and not because of humility, but because they really do not display any actions or thoughts that I\u2019d consider indicative of \u201cstrength,\u201d and because they really are, in fact, just plain boring and bland. Lena talks at length about her unusually vibrant mother and how she feels different than everyone else, but little of her actions (or lack thereof) really show me that. None of the other characters in DELIRIUM really felt real to me, either. The romance between Lena and Alex was more about this inexplicable attraction between the two of them than any substantial development of a relationship. In fact, the narration seems to spend more time describing why this character or other should be a certain way instead of just letting the characters be the way they want us to see them as. Does that make sense? As a reader, I value my ability to figure out what the author intends for characters\u2019 personalities instead of them being analyzed to death by the narration. As far as characterization goes, I definitely think that less (analysis) is more (details). But what didn\u2019t work for me right from the start was the premise of DELIRIUM. Don\u2019t get me wrong: if done right, I\u2019m a sucker for the dystopian love-is-bad setup. But DELIRIUM failed to convince me of the world\u2019s\u2014shall we say, \u201cfullness.\u201d Perhaps this is because DELIRIUM arrives in the midst of a slew of other YA dystopian novels in which love is considered dangerous. It\u2019s a hard premise to develop well, let\u2019s just say that upfront! Nevertheless, as the pages passed, I found myself wondering: from what did this start? How does the science behind the cure actually work? Why do they allow those \u201cdangerous\u201d Uncured rebels to live in the wild without striking them down with all of their might? And then\u2014if the society is supposedly so strict, why does Lena so easily escape the notice of all the Regulators on her law-breaking midnight bike ride? And then\u2014how the hell would a group of people be able to have a typical high school beer-n-music barn party in this society? If that didn\u2019t smack you upside the head as a blatant setup for another chance encounter between Lena and Alex, then I don\u2019t know what will. I just\u2026didn\u2019t think the setup behind Lena\u2019s society was thought through well enough to convince me that the characters fully lived in this world. The writing is wonderful, but that will not do it for me if the protagonist, supporting characters, and premise of the book do not feel complete. I\u2019m sure that many readers will be so captivated by the lyricism and philosophical provocation to let my issues with the book hinder them, and rightfully so for the book. Still, though, this is what I thought of it. ...more I had chills--CHILLS--at the end of Lauren Oliver's Delirium. It was like I could hear Muse's \"Uprising\" playing in the background as I read the last passage. I was unbelievably moved by this resistance movement that will fight for the right to love. I had to read the last page out loud to my non-literary husband (something I haven't done since \"Katniss, there is no District 12\") just so that I could share it with someone.

Fans of young adult dystopian fiction, rejoice! A remarkable new series has been added to our genre. I've been reading dystopian fiction way before there ever was The Hunger Games, and I was captivated by Delirium. This novel combines so many classic elements of dystopian literature into a moving, heart-rending tale of the ultimate forbidden love--not only is Lena forbidden to chose whom she will love, but she is forbidden to love PERIOD. I saw echoes of so many favorite dystopian works in Delirium (1984, Anthem, and perhaps the first YA dystopian novel, John Christopher's The White Mountains). I was hooked from the very beginning. I love the premise, and Lauren Oliver really delivered. Although the first quarter of the book drags in places, once Oliver hits her stride, the story grips your heart and emotions and doesn't let go. Oliver takes us on this fascinating journey of self-discovery with Lena, as Lena slowly learns to trust her heart, question the \"truths\" she's always been taught, and ultimately choose for herself. I loved seeing Lena gradually awaken from the slumber this world places on the mind as Alex show her how to think and feel and LOVE for herself. And that ending? I was blown away. Oliver foreshadowed it throughout the book, but I was still floored. There are certain events that I REALLY hope are possible for the next book based on that ending, so I read the last few pages several times to see if there's any hope there, and believe there is. Was that vague enough to keep it spoiler free? Delirium is a thought-provoking tale that had me riveted. It combines some of my favorite elements--forbidden love, dystopian world, resistance movement--into one compelling book that will haunt you well after you've read that stunning last passage. ...more DNF/Shelving this book because I have been told by trustworthy sources this series has probably the worst ending in history. I read the first few chapters and was intrigued but not entirely impressed. But I am NOT reading three books to be disappointed by a crappy ending. NOPE.

Sacrifice. I want to say something about sacrifice, but the word doesn\u2019t come. It was ... wow. I never read a book by Lauren Oliver before. I absolutely had to. First of all, I must say- Lauren Oliver and I have the same mind. Even if the book was boring to death, I guess I was enjoying it because Lauren's characters has the same perspective on the world just like me. So I don't know if I'm biased or not, but I really enjoyed this book. let's talk about the characters. Lena. I read many reviews about this book before I picked it up, and almost in all of them, were written things that are not so pleasant about Lena. So let's say that I started the book, expecting not to like her. and perhaps this is the reason why (or maybe not), but I really loved Lena. She was so... human. so realistic. She was insecure. She believed, like everyone else, to the lies they tell to the people about the \"deliria\". She loved herself, but she hated herself. She didn't always behaved properly. She didn't always managed to keep her mouth shut. She was whiny but brave. She was weak but able to stand on her own. She knew how to love, but she also knew hate. Alex. It may sound superficial to you, but once he said his name was Alex, he almost took a little place in my heart. I didn't like him right away, of course. (I'm not that weird) (Or maybe I am) but I love the name Alex so much, and I enjoyed every time Lena said his name. (I never came across the name Alex in a book at the past, except once, and he was a shitty person.) and besides that? Well, let's say that you would want a boyfriend like Alex. (Anything else I want to say about him will be considered as a spoiler.) I can continue to write about how much this book is amazing and about the genuine idea of it, but in any case I don't have too much time and I really want to move to the second book. (I also decided to read the novellas, so...) Oh, and if you read the book, we can conclude that the end of the book blew your mind, right? ;) ...more I love dystopian fiction, it\u2019s always a neat way to bring greater problems that our society has into greater focus or serve as an in-depth commentary of it.

Despite the fact that we were bogged down with tons of info-dumping in the beginning none of this ever feels concrete as to why the government really felt a need to get rid of love. There are suggestions/answers but it\u2019s not really strong enough to merit such a complete and drastic change. Also, I understand that the idea of having Lena\u2019s mother undergo lobotomy while awake should be a shocking image driven home for the reader but in actuality, the brain has no pain receptors. So therefore Lena\u2019s mother would be none the worst for the wear because she can\u2019t actually feel this happening to her. Overlooked error? Perhaps. Another problem was Lena. She was such a passive, weak character. She really never took any initiative for herself to find ways to beat the rules and regulation set down upon her and everything she does is usually one of reaction rather than pro-action. Also, I found that she was an extremely wish-y wash-y character. She says she\u2019s not going to do one thing but later ends up doing it or vice versa, says she\u2019ll do something but doesn\u2019t come true. I\u2019m sure a lot of people will like the romance because the guy was a nice understanding person but their romance fizzled out for me. It was sudden and without much chemistry. Although, I\u2019m not sure about you but if I was chased and savaged by some giant beasts of a dog, I sure as heck would not be interested in making out in a dirty old barn where it smells like urine and my leg is bleeding its guts out. I\u2019d be all \u201coh shit! Am I gonna get rabies!? Quick, get me the antiseptic!\u201d The ending was super clich\u00e9 and a roll your eyes, \u201coh yeah, I totally did not see that coming. Uh huh.\u201d Not to mention the obvious deus ex machina problem. Where the hell did he get that motorcycle? Wtf? It was obviously done so as to lead this series into a trilogy but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m particularly happy about it. Great idea, just not enough. ...more", "Title": "Delirium"},
