I began <+++>The Maze Runner</+++> excitedly, hoping for an equally enjoyable, dystopian adventure. I didn't find it. The plot was intriguing and kept me reading; in fact, it was probably the only reason why I kept reading. Some writers are able to seamlessly integrate characterization and good writing with a fast-moving plot; James Dashner is not one of them. The pacing is strange, and Dashner's use of cliches became very irritating. The main character, Thomas, was annoying. Rather than allowing his readers to feel what Thomas feels, Dashner chooses to tell . We are told many times how \"frustrated\" and \"confused\" Thomas is, but we can't identify with him. Some of the supporting characters, such as Minho and Newt, could be interesting, but they remain secondary to Thomas. In addition, I was frustrated with the character Teresa. Teresa is the only female main character; instead of making her an intriguing, powerful female, she is christened with flimsy adjectives such as \"very pretty\" and \"smart\", becoming yet another 1-dimensional character. I realize that this is a plot-driven story and not a character-driven one, but I would hope that the characters would at least be appealing to the reader. Criticism aside, I found the book enjoyable, and the plot kept me hooked. I felt that the epilogue was well-written and I might seek out the rest of the series when it is published. Ultimately, it's unfortunate that Dashner's poor writing takes away from a good story line; in the hands of a writing master, I believe that The Maze Runner could have been something extraordinary. 2.5/5 EDIT: More than a year later, I have not procured any other books in the series, nor do I intend to. Personally speaking, this is one series better left alone. ...more This book would have been great IF: 1) the characters had some personality 2) the main character - Thomas - weren't such a Gary Stu and showed some character development and growth instead of conveniently \"remembering\" important information to advance the plot 3) the book weren't filled with atrocious made-up slang - \"shuck-face,\" really, is this supposed to be cool? 4) the villains - Grievers - were actually scary or dangerous 5) the maze had some kind of mystery about it and not limited to moving w This book would have been great IF: 1) the characters had some personality 2) the main character - Thomas - weren't such a Gary Stu and showed some character development and growth instead of conveniently \"remembering\" important information to advance the plot 3) the book weren't filled with atrocious made-up slang - \"shuck-face,\" really, is this supposed to be cool? 4) the villains - Grievers - were actually scary or dangerous 5) the maze had some kind of mystery about it and not limited to moving walls and un-threatening prickly Grievers 6) the plot weren't based on constant withholding of information by everyone and releasing it 200 pages later than it should have been 7) the smartest of the smartest kids actually did something smart and uncovered some mysteries of the maze during the 2 years spent there 8) the death of main characters evoked any feeling in readers 9) the book weren't so slow-moving (<---B>thanks to constant withholding of info</---B>) and BORING! In the present form \"The Maze Runner\" deserves nothing more than an OK rating for moderately interesting premise. The hype and comparisons to \"The Hunger Games\" are unwarranted. ...more You know how sometimes you're running really fast from a horrible creature and, in a moment of panic, you turn around to see how close it is only to run straight into a brick wall? No? I don't know what that's like either. But that inattention to detail would probably totally screw you over because a.) now you're knocked unconscious and b.) the creature is going to devour you. Good job. I guess this is kind of like Lot's wife looking back on Sodom only to be turned into a pillar of salt. And it is You know how sometimes you're running really fast from a horrible creature and, in a moment of panic, you turn around to see how close it is only to run straight into a brick wall? No? I don't know what that's like either. But that inattention to detail would probably totally screw you over because a.) now you're knocked unconscious and b.) the creature is going to devour you. Good job. I guess this is kind of like Lot's wife looking back on Sodom only to be turned into a pillar of salt. And it is also kind of like reading The Maze Runner . Stick with me. The first half of James Dashner's The Maze Runner maintains a superbly frantic pace. Thomas, our empty-shell-of-a-protagonist is thrust, via the Box, into a curious and unfriendly world populated by dozens of teenage boys. He remembers nothing, and the boys are uncooperative, refusing to reveal any details regarding their home, the Glade. The Glade is surrounded by stupendously tall walls, outside of which lays the Maze. During the day, the Maze is (kinda sorta) safe. But at night, the Grievers emerge. These are half slug/half woodshop tools that enjoy slicing and dicing apart anyone unfortunate to encounter them. They can also sting you, which causes much mayhem and requires the administering of Grief Serum, which triggers the Changing. SIDEBAR! What Is It With Authors Of Dystopian Novels Capitalizing Really Important Words? It's Annoying. Find A New Stylistic Approach That I Can Later Become Exasperated With. Anyway, Thomas' situation is bleak, made bleaker when a number of unfortunate coincidences causes him to bear witness to some truly awful acts of violence. Let's just say one untrustworthy soul is unwittingly tossed into the Maze at night and then a girl (not a boy!!!!!!!!) suspiciously arrives the day after Thomas. All of this, despite the Unnecessary Capitalization and the boys using completely pointless terminology like klunk and shuckface , is totally kitty fantastico. The constant psychological mystery keeps nagging doubts at bay and the variety of personalities that populate the Glade is totally believable. They talk like teenagers, they (generally) act like teenagers, and they form cliques and factions the way teenagers would. (From here on I'm covering up \"spoilers\", even though I think they're total nonsense and hilariously awful. And because I advise you not to read this book, you should click them. Just keeping the haters at bay.) Then Thomas (view spoiler) [spends a night in (hide spoiler) ] the Maze. And the book falls apart. For those of you paying attention, here's where the running into a brick wall metaphor arrives full gale. Dashner, whose prose has heretofore been mediocre but serviceable, completely fails his audience. He writes himself into a corner. He knows it, we know it. Thomas, who has always been slightly unlikeable and jerky becomes even more unlikeable and jerky, and the plot holes start opening up like the really bad similes peppered throughout the narrative. How does Dashner patch them up? (view spoiler) [Telepathy! (hide spoiler) ] Seriously. (view spoiler) [Telepathy! (hide spoiler) ] Yup. The girl who mysteriously appeared (view spoiler) [communicates with Thomas with her mind (hide spoiler) ] and tells him (view spoiler) [all sorts of shit that's supposed to clear everything up (hide spoiler) ] . It doesn't. It just creates a frustrating deus ex machina that could have been avoided, but isn't. As Thomas's character stumbles upon more and more unbelievable clues, like (view spoiler) [the moving walls of the maze actually form patterns of letters (that Thomas will eventually and conveniently know what to do with after experiencing the Changing himself), (hide spoiler) ] the book loses its momentum significantly. In fact, despite tearing through the first half of the book, I had to put it down. Afterwards, every time I looked at that stupid green cover, I found myself filled with dread - knowing full well that what remained would irritate me. And it did. Sometimes when the first book of a trilogy ends on a cliffhanger, I feel compelled to continue. I don't care what happens to Thomas and the rest of the characters. Maybe they'll smoke lots of pot, form a commune, and grow daisies. Maybe they'll turn into Grievers. Maybe they'll run into Katniss and Peeta and become BFFs. But I will let you, gentle reader, find that out for yourself. ...more Q: if you could edit this book, what would you take out? A: the words. . . .

Have you ever had a middle-aged man try to describe to you completing the games section of the New York Times? Did those experiences involve multiple conversations like this: \u201cWhat is the maze?\u201d \u201cStop asking so many questions!\u201d I have to say that this book was more boring than having someone tell you in painful detail about winning a video game or finishing a crossword puzzle. It is more boring if only for the constant, \"What are you talking about?\" \"No! I won't tell you!\" This book is astonishingly boring. I know that I am predisposed not to like it because there are no female characters (no, I do not count the leggy, blue-eyed girlfriend as a female character), but, really, I ask you: are there any male characters either? If you say, yes, then I challenge you to prove it. Are Mario and Luigi and Princess Toadstool characters in Mario Kart? What about the ducks in Duck Hunt? Are they characters ? We have to draw the line somewhere. And I submit to you that there are no characters in this book. Or, at least, there are fewer characters in this book than there are in Duck Hunt. Also, a couple of things that bothered me throughout: 1. What famous scientist was Minho named after? Okay, I just googled that and apparently Dashner \u201cpurposely\u201d named a few characters after scientists who will supposedly exist in the future. Like the only Asian kid in the book. Because there are no Asian scientists today that he could name someone after. *facedesk* And like Zart. Zart and the Asian kid were not named after scientists. *double facedesk* 2. Why can\u2019t the grievers climb over the wall? They obviously can climb. But not over the wall? Did I miss this? At first I thought the kids were in some kind of dome, but then it seemed like it was just a really tall wall. . . . That it was impossible to climb? WHYYY????? 3. What purpose does the telepathy serve? None is the answer. It serves no purpose. 4. Why is this book so, so, so long and boring? So, maybe a third of the way through the book, I developed this false hope that this book would be some kind of pretty metaphor for children going through the grieving process and supporting each other in loss. I thought, \u201cOh, grievers! Maybe the challenges of the maze and the bonding of the boys in the glade will have some larger message.\u201d No. This book is not about that. It is about doing the NYT games section and then maybe vague talk of zombies later. Total bullshit. I have to think this book came out while LOST was still on and before its terrible conclusion, which forced millions of Americans to face the fact that when it looks like a story will have no purpose, it probably has no purpose. I have to think Dashner thought he could bank on the millions of us willing to suspend our skepticism and keep watching a show whose writers clearly had no plan. I am hoping that in the wake of that disaster, we will have grown up a little and be less willing to stand for bullshit like this. I googled it, and, yes, I was right. Cashing in on gullible LOST audience. Unacceptable. ...more \u201cYou are the shuckiest shuck faced shuck in the world!\u201d 2 1/2 stars.

It's not terrible . I can still see why someone who is new to YA dystopias might get caught up in the loosely-plotted (read: nothing happens) drama and think that \"shuck\" amounts to a clever invention of a new language. But as I was rereading this before seeing the new movie, I realised just how much it pales in comparison to many others in the genre. The thing about this book is that it is so simplistic and... immature, I guess. I'm not here to simply piss off the book's fans - I enjoyed it too, remember! - and I can still see why it might provide some light entertainment. But... the characters and plot are so underdeveloped. The language seems silly now. The scary Grievers no longer seem scary, but cartoon comical instead. Dashner uses that tiresome old writing technique called \"withholding information\" to propel the non-existent plot along. The whole book is built around a single mystery - that of the maze - and our supposedly intelligent-beyond-belief characters keep the novel going by standing around and scratching their heads. It's so lacking in any depth, layers or complexity. Comparisons to The Hunger Games are frankly quite hilarious when you consider Collins' intricate world, complex characters and clever plot... then consider what Dashner offers up next to it. Not to mention that Thomas is an extremely boring, self-sacrificing MC. In its defense, though, I was still affected by what happens near the end. I would recommend the book - with some hesitation - for younger readers or those who are new to YA dystopian fiction.

I finished it into the late hours of the night and I kept circling in my head what was going to happen next. The point is moot but I am definitely going to read the sequel The Scorch Trials . From the start as the reader we have NO idea what is happening. All Thomas can remember is his name. Not where he came from or any specific details of his life. Neither do any of the other Gladers who he meets in the beginning of the book. The place is filled with boys whose sole purpose is to try to get out of this place by solving the maze. They haven't had any luck in two years, but that may all change with Thomas's arrival. Strange things start to happen, and people are pointing fingers at Thomas. Will he be the one to get them out, or the boy who will bring them down? At first I was having a hard time getting into this book. Nobody wants to answer Thomas's questions, and I got just as frustrated as he did. I actually still don't completely understand why they didn't want to answer all his questions right away. The plot does pick up speed though and you get to meet Newt, <---C>Chuck</---C>, Minho, and Alby (all important characters in their own right). The world building is good because I got the creeps just thinking about the grievers, and I can feel the desperation but at the same time the camaraderie the guys have with each other. There is also a unique language setup that was a tad-bit confusing at first but you pick it up as Thomas does. The ending certainly is gonna give the series a big shakeup. I really want to see what Dashner has up his sleeve this time. I read this because of the good reception it was getting, but also because of a display at Barnes & Nobles. They had all these books that were hugely popular within the young adult realm and I had read all of them except, you guessed it, this one. I couldn't have any of that! Added later: Great news guys, there are making this into a movie! Here is a link to the little info that is out about the movie. Basically nothing but hopefully in the coming months that will change!

Breathe, Inge, breathe. Oh, this is gooooood . The Maze Runner was like a breath of fresh air to me. I needed a nice, clean cut from the typical YA books filled with whiny protagonists, insta-love and love triangles, and I got exactly what I asked for. This book is like a giant puzzle that you solve along with the characters. It is filled with unexpected twists and turns, full of action and I sighed every once in a while because it was so much to take in at once. It started off highly confusing, but soon took a turn for the exciting and left me hanging with so many unanswered questions; after the last page, I was still begging for more. The Maze Runner had me gripping my seat until the very end. A great and very thrilling read. Thomas was a curious, smart and brave protagonist and basically everything the Gladers needed at the time. I didn\u2019t really connect to any of the characters because they were a bit snappy and unpredictable, but I could definitely understand all the reactions and feelings. I felt all the emotions myself. I felt the sorrow, the despair, the excitement, the need for survival, everything. Though the idea of slug-like creatures didn\u2019t really appeal to me at first, I got used to the image of the deadly Grievers after a while. They ended up being quite gross and I started fearing them as well. The arrival of the girl definitely lightened things up, not much, but enough. The deaths were very predictable but they did add to the story. And that ending! Ooooh, that ending killed me! I was so happy when I read the last sentence, and then I read that freaking epilogue . That was heart-wrenching. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a happy ending because it\u2019s a trilogy, but I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. I definitely didn\u2019t expect this. Now I must get my hands on the sequel as soon as possible. Damn you, James Dashner. Like the publisher said, \u201dThanks, James!

Sometimes this strategy backfires and the 'fluffy' book actually tries to break my long-suffering brain cells with its sheer stupidity. It's not even mediocre; mediocrity would be elevating this book to the undeserved heights. It's simply boring, uninspired, ridiculous and poorly executed. ------ Let me sum up the things that I thought were awful, stupid or just plain ridiculous (apparently my febrile brain likes making lists): # The dumbed-down plot full of holes that relies on pointless withholding of any useful information. Seriously. When there is no reason for keeping the characters in the dark, all suspense goes out of the window. There was no reason why nobody could tell Thomas what was going on when he showed up in the Glade or when he saw the Doors or the Maze. While I'm at it, can anyone please explain why the klunky shanking shuckface are the words randomly capitalized? Is the book meant to evoke the thoughts of the German language where the nouns are capitalized? Or was the author too lazy to come up with proper names for places and instead just threw in some capitalization? Foolishness, I say. The frustrating to me approach of never discussing what happened with those who went through the Changing. The lack of curiosity about the only potential exit from the Maze that the boys have found in two (!) years. The pointless doing the same thing over and over again just to come up with the same results, relishing in the special status of the Runners instead of just sitting down to discuss the situation and their findings. # The atrocious unbearable awkward slang. Replacing 'fuck' with 'shuck' and 'shit' with 'klank' for PG purposes does not work when you shove it unto the readers' faces every sentence or so. At least be inventive or make it sound organic, but all that's achieved is sounding like a five-year-old complaining to her Mummy. \"You're the shuckiest shuck-faced shuck there ever was.\" I rest my case in the face of this nonsense. # The silver plate on which everything is handed to the absolutely special protagonist. Because Thomas is so special at fragging everything. He doesn't even need to try. Instead, when we need a proof of his awesomeness, the get the sudden impulses and urges that are never wrong, or if that fails, simply a quasi-recollection that saves the day. Which segues into my next frustration point: # The lack of any character development besides the-author-wants-it-so approach. The author knows what he wants to happen in this book, and he moves the characters along like checkers pieces, just to make plot happen. The characters are just sorta there, are static, and therefore I could never get invested in them enough to care even when some of them died. Especially when the death of at least one of them was pointless. # The pointless villains and scares that should have been comic relief instead . Yes, the Grievers and the strangely non-menacing way they were portrayed. The Maze that is anything but intimidating (that effect is due to the non-spectacular writing, really). The Changing - oh so scary of experience! - that does not really affect Thomas the Special Snowflake, not even a minor inconvenience. # The pointless vilifying of perfectly reasonable characters for the sole purpose of making our special protagonist even more snowflake-ish. It's poor Gally, who's labeled as a \"bully\" before he's had a chance to do anything even remotely bully-ish except for staring at Thomas with dislike. To cement his unlikeability, Gally is described as physically unattractive - because in shallow books like this one if you look like a villain, you must be one. Gally, whose distrust of Thomas is perfectly logical (if any of the characters would take any time to think about it instead of singing accolades to the Special Snowflake). # The too-stupid-to-live characters. Seriously. Every few pages my reaction was - really? You guys haven't tried that ? You haven't thought of this ?? You haven't talked about that? ??? Ugh. # The action scenes that read like a video game narration. This does not work in real life - even the kind of 'real life' that involves a few dozen of teen boys stranded in a few square miles area where they successfully run a farm, a slaughterhouse and an industrial-size kitchen. # The \"big reveal\" that is simply told to us, without anyone really earning it. No, the characters do not work hard just to get the pay-off; they get told all that's happening, like a cheap trick. # The absolute lack of any suspense or motivation to help propel the plot forward. No, everything is simplistic, childish and therefore strangely light and unconcerning. There is no depth, no real substance, and no complexity. It's page-filler, easy to read, easy to forget. 1.5 stars. Yawn. A frustrated yawn, at that. ...more At first I was a bit put out with this book.

Luckily around page 60 or so, Dashner hit his stride and I became enthralled with this story. It\u2019s so difficult to write a review that divulges information about the plot without simultaneously giving the plot away. Dashner mastered the art of dolling out need to know information in spades while maintaining an air of mystery that keeps you immersed in the story, craving for more. The Maze Runner begins with Thomas finding himself memory-less, surrounded by teenage boys of varying ages, in a strange place called the Glade. Thomas immediately begins asking questions, attempting to get his bearings, though answers aren\u2019t forth coming, and the Gladers are none to helpful. Nonetheless, life doesn\u2019t seem too shabby in the Glade. There is a homestead, crops, barns filled with livestock, the sun always shines, and various supplies appear in \u201cthe box\u201d each week upon request. There even appears to be order within the Glade, though it is filled with nothing but testosterone fueled teenage boys. There appears to be only a handful of rules, 1. Never threaten your fellow Gladers, 2. Everyone must pull their weight, 3. No one is allowed in the Maze aside from runners, 4. No one is allowed in the Maze after dark. Though the rules are rather self-explanatory, their necessity becomes all to clear once Thomas is allowed to know what lurks behind the stone walls protecting the Glade. While no one knows how they came to arrive in the Glade, why they were sent, or who sent them, they all strive towards a common goal, solving the Maze and leaving the Glade. But once the first ever girl arrives into the Glade, a trigger is pulled, and the stakes for survival are raised. Despite the fact that I didn\u2019t have an emotional reaction (crying when it was clear that I was meant to), I couldn\u2019t set this book down. I wasn\u2019t scared for any of the characters, my heart didn\u2019t race, but I desperately wanted to solve the freakin mystery. Luckily, there is a conclusion of sorts; however, this is clearly a series as you gain new information that tickles your intrigue before coming to a major halt. Grr.

The plot was fast paced, suspenseful and full of suprises. The twists and turns this book took shocked me unlike any other book I've read. It also has some creative lingo but I found it easy to understand and I actually think it added to this books charm. The ending was amazing but left me with so many questions that I need answers for RIGHT NOW and I really wish October 12th would hurry up so I can read The Scorch Trials. All I have to say is read this book (especially you, Morgan :D). ...more As in Harry Potter Grades system, Exceed Expectations Didn't expect I'd Like it that much.

Ahora que he le\u00eddo el libro puedo decir que estoy fascinada con el mundo que ha creado el autor y que nadie puede morir sin leerlo. Como comentaba, lo m\u00e1s fascinante de la saga es la ambientaci\u00f3n y el mundo que crea el autor. Sin duda la idea del laberinto no es nada original, pero s\u00ed el claro que hay en medio y la trama que se desarrolla en \u00e9l. Adem\u00e1s de los monstruos, laceradores, que crea el autor y con los que juega todo el tiempo. La trama de la novela es muy buena. Es original, tiene giros y un desenlace inesperado y que deja con muchas ganas de m\u00e1s. Me gusta la l\u00ednea argumental que sigue el autor y tambi\u00e9n c\u00f3mo entrelaza a los diferentes personajes con la trama. Me gust\u00f3 mucho la idea general y todo el desarrollo que hay en la novela. Los personajes tambi\u00e9n me encantaron. Todos los personajes masculinos tienen una buena profundidad y los protagonistas son fant\u00e1sticos. Me gusta que cada uno tenga una caracterizaci\u00f3n diferente y que tengan algunos giros inesperados. El \u00fanico personaje que no me ha convencido para nada es Teresa porque es demasiado plano. Parece jugar un papel demasiado importante casi al final y siendo, seg\u00fan la trama, un personaje clave deber\u00eda haber tenido una mayor profundidad y en s\u00ed desarrollo, porque es plan\u00edsimo. El corredor del laberinto es una novela ya muy famosa y de la que queda poco por decir, quien no la conozca es porque vive debajo de una piedra. Ten\u00eda unas alt\u00edsimas expectativas por esto mismo y las ha superado, algo poco habitual. El ritmo es fren\u00e9tico, es una novela adictiva que se bebe r\u00e1pidamente. Tiene una buena densidad que podr\u00eda hacer de esta novela algo pesado y dif\u00edcil de leer, pero sin duda el autor tiene una pluma \u00e1gil y sabe enganchar al lector. En resumen, El corredor del laberinto ha sido una novela que me ha encantado, que me ha dejado con ganas de m\u00e1s y que recomiendo a cualquier tipo de lector porque merece much\u00edsimo la pena. ...more It's 1am, just finished this and it was aMAZEing, see what I did there ;) Review to come!!

A solar flare is a sudden brightening observed over the Sun's surface, which is interpreted as a large energy release of up to 6 \u00d7 1025 joules of energy. G is for Goethe! Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a German writer and politician.

A timeless question! H is for Hybrid! A cross between a giant slug and a killing machine equipped with pincers & needles would be considered a sort of hybrid. Machine-animal hybrids often appear within genres such as science fantasy, steampunk, and the post-apocalyptic young adult adventure novel. I is for IQ! The Intelligence Quotient is a score derived from standardized testing in order to assess intelligence. Some have questioned its use\u2026 J is for Janissary! As children, the Janissaries were taken from their parents to become elite soldiers in the Ottoman Empire. They revolted against their masters during the \u201cAuspicious Incident\u201d of 1826.

A bunch of boys stranded in a dangerous environment! They revert into savages! Murder and Mayhem and Malice, Oh My!

I would say that running around in the same maze for two years is pretty damned tenacious. U is for Unanswered Questions! Some readers felt frustration or anger at the end of The Maze Runner \u2013 too many questions left unanswered, too abrupt of a cliffhanger. I felt quite a bit of frustration as well, but for the opposite reason: I would have appreciated less questions answered, more ambiguity. I wanted less of a plunge into a rather typical post-apocalyptic adventure and more running about in a maze for reasons unknown. Although I did enjoy the actual cliffhanger. V is for Vendetta! The characters in The Maze Runner use the idea of Vendetta to fight back, to inspire themselves, to fling themselves into the unknown. \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d is a graphic novel by Alan Moore. The movie adaptation of that comic contains this quote: \u201cThere are no coincidences, only the illusion of coincidences\u201d \u2026 which of course is an approximation of Albert Einstein\u2019s quote: \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe\u201d \u2026 indeed! But who is this \u201cGod\u201d in Maze Runner's universe?

I trust you can connect the dots here. Y is for Young Adult! I think that many of our classic and modern young adult stories together form the fables of our times. A handful of narratives that are repeated and reshaped, told through hundreds - thousands? - of different books and read by millions of readers. Their prose is usually transparent and their meanings overt. The reader and the protagonist are given clear lessons to learn. But the reader may, in turn, choose to project their own meanings onto these archetypical stories.

The majority of this book is people jealously withholding information that gets revealed a few chapters later, which makes it painfully obvious that all the not-telling going on is just for the sake of dragging things out. The \"puzzle\" of the maze should have been solved in the first week (or at least, parts of it should), the \"monsters\" were so easy to beat that I'm still confused as to why the boys didn't kill them all sooner, and Thomas got way too much praise for merely existing. The rest of the cast had to be dumbed down to some truly paint-eating levels in order to make him look good, but the book went ahead and did that. (At one point, Thomas was actually praised for his \"brilliant\" tactic for getting around the monsters, which consisted of \"fake right, dodge left.\" Toddlers can figure that one out.) And I really have no words for that ending except: no one involved in this project should be allowed anywhere near an environmental debate. Clearly, too many lessons facts about how the planet works need to be re-taught first. To cap off the fail-cake that is this book, we also got the lovely message of \"if anyone disagrees with you and gets angry about it, call them insane.

Now, I didn't hate The Maze Runner by any means. But I didn't love it either. It was . . . likable. Likeable, but not loveable. Perhaps I'm just too jaded to really appreciate YA fiction (though I did love The Amulet of Samarkand . Speaking of which, I really need to reread it and write a review). Maybe I'm getting too old to appreciate YA characters (though I really connected with Ender of Ender's Game ). In any case, I think the real problem is that Dashner got some things backwards. I was frankly put off by the blatant foreshadowing or, more appropriately, \"backshadowing\" that Dashner used like a blunt object to hit readers over the head with information. The (view spoiler) [memory-wipe trick (hide spoiler) ] that provides so much of the impetus for the plot could have been carefully employed to maneuver the reader's thoughts and emotions into place for a brilliant ending. But I felt that Dashner used it as a cheap parlor trick. He also misses the opportunity to really make the reader care deeply about (view spoiler) [Thomas and Teresa's (hide spoiler) ] relationship, not to mention the relationship between Thomas and Chuck, (view spoiler) [whose death did very little to tug at my emotional heartstrings when I wanted to be ripped apart with grief (hide spoiler) ] . Rather than allowing Thomas to love deeply and passionately, which would have endeared readers to him (and others), the (view spoiler) [memory trick (hide spoiler) ] got in the way of us getting to know and love him, flattening him out as a character. The plot itself is strange and intriguing. Because this is the first book in a series, I found the ending unsatisfactory. I sort of want to read the next book, since I'd like to understand some of the mysteries, and I want to give Dashner the chance to redeem himself, but time being what it is, I'm not rushing to the bookstore to add the sequel to my TBR pile. I suspect that if you're willing to go the distance, and if you're not an over-educated snob like me, you might love this book. Again, I'm not in love with it, but I'm in like with it. Maybe, some date in the future, if/when I read the sequels, I might bump the star rating up. But for the meantime, The Maze Runner remains stuck in the maze at 3 stars. ...more The Maze Runner is a masterfully plotted mystery. It's intriguing.

You can't help but like characters that are trapped in an almost literal Hell and somehow make the most of it to the point you secretly wish you were part of it. There's something magical in that. A story can only go so far with characters that don't really have any meaningful connection to the plot or the setting , though. Any of these guys could've been replaced for any other personality with barely any notice. I think James Dashner really squeezed the best possible plot he could out of the characters he created. The real pitfall of The Maze Runner is the writing. As Dashner might write, It's really, really bad . So bad, it leaves you feeling nothing in a lot of scenes you should feel loss or adrenaline or relief or... anything. ...more I enjoyed the Maze Runner, but not as much as I wanted to. It was a great concept, and the story was compelling, the characters and plot twists interesting, and there was no limit to Dashner\u2019s creativity.

Let's discuss. I bought this book over a year ago because of the Dystopia craze.. having read so much dystopia though, I wasn't able to pick it up. It's been a while though, and I picked it up at a time where I was excited for it which turned out for the best. I was first stricken with how fascinating the whole world concept for this books is: it's very reminiscent of The Lord of the Flies in that you have a bunch of kids desperate for life but not knowing what to do. I've always enjoyed reading and thinking about how bodies of people govern themselves, and this made an interesting study. Also, of course!, you have this epic arena: a huge maze infested with giant lizard-robot creatures and no seeming escape, it's great! But here lies my problem with this book: you understand the world within the first few pages, you pretty much understand what's going on. Therefore, I expected \"Okay, I get it! Cool.. what's going to be the plot in this interesting setting?\" .. and you don't find out for 300 pages. SERIOUSLY! Most of this book is the main character, Thomas, asking questions and NEVER getting answers. It was infuriating! I felt all this potential for the story, it honestly has such an exciting prospect, but then you learn nothing further about the world and the plot goes nowhere. A couple of people have told me that this was all necessary information needed for the sequels, and I completely disagree. It's always good to set an over arching idea with details for a series, but that shouldn't take up over 2/3rds of this book! I will not budge on my feelings that this book had a lot of wasted time merely standing around the Glade that should have been cut out to make the story an actual story: I want plot, something to follow! However, and this is where I was so happily surprised, the last hundred or so pages of this book WERE exactly what I wanted (expected). They were completely action packed, very suspenseful, and absolutely thrilling to read. I at first wondered if it would be \"too little, too late\" but my final verdict is no.. it was so very exciting that although it was close to not being good enough, it definitely brought the whole book up for me. The writing in this book was overall enjoyable: one thing I HAVE to praise is the descriptions... they were never too lengthy or distracting and they always left a clear image in my mind. A lot of the time when action scenes are described in books I'm really confused as to who is kicking who/where someone is running/what is attacking them but this writing really nailed good description. However, I do have to point to the lack of suspensefulness: I could feel that the James Dashner wanted things for the first 2/3rds of this book to feel suspenseful, but instead they felt slow, dragged out, and actually kind of annoying. Overall, it was a tough read for most of the way through, but the ending portion really made up for it. I DEFINITELY want to read the next book, The Scorch Trials, and look forward to seeing where this story progresses.. I'm scared that the slow world building won't be eradicated though because we are completely changing arena's, but we will see! I have my fingers crossed! At least I know to push through the slowness because I'll probably have an exciting ending waiting for me! Note on the epilogue: IT WAS PERFECTION. I really appreciate when an author ties of a book well, especially when it's part of a series: I don't want to be left completely hanging having no closure at the end of a book. This book did sum up really well though, it had a conclusion, this chapter ended. The epilogue gave the perfect twist though, absolutely unexpected and brilliant. ...more I don't say this often, but I actually liked the movie waaaay more. The movie & book plots are pretty similar, but I felt like the tense/emotional parts of the story were a lot stronger in the movie. If I hadn't seen the movie, I don't think I would've had a strong sense of the characters or connected to anything very much at all. The premise is interesting, but the movie pulls you in way more.

The writing + plot are kind of simplistic and hinge on withholding all the answers, so perhaps seeing the movie first ruined it for me.

But Thomas keeps getting vague thoughts and memories of people places and things. Not memories per se, more like feelings that he has been there before. I loved so many of these boys and Teresa when she gets there. <--- part of that sentence didn't sound right, but I digress. There seems to be one main jerk of the group and his name is Gally. He tries to cause a lot of trouble for Thomas and he does do something I will never forgive him for in the end. I will cut him down! Anyway, so they have this little farming structure set up. Everyone has jobs like the crop keeper, or the cook, or the butcher, or runner and etc and so on. At one point they bumped Thomas up as a runner because he saved some peeps and stuff. But you know I can tell you that I would be changing my mind after dealing with all of the crazy stuff in the maze. You have to run through and try to find new ways to get out and not get eaten. Here are two examples why I would not want to be a runner. \u2193 But you have to do what you have to do I guess. And then some bad stuff happens and the whole group have to get out. Get out now! Some more good and bad stuff happen and they end up finding the CREATORS, or JERKS in my opinion, and they are taken off to go on another mission of sorts. Either way this book and movie was so amazing.

Thomas, the MC, suddenly shows up in an isolated place/society with no memory of his family or friends. The only thing he can remember is his name. Turns out he's inside a place called the Maze and most its male occupants have been here for two years, trying to find a way out while forging a living for themselves. It's not easy though. The walls of the Maze shift every night and deep within, lurk half-beast, half-machines called Grievers. The only people allowed out of their walled home to solve this Maze are Runners, the elite of the elite, mentally and physically. Guess what Thomas wants to be? Thomas is, arguably, a special snowflake following in the footsteps of Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and Darrow from Red Rising . But whereas Darrow's specialness was thrust in my face with all the delicacy of a wrecking ball, Thomas's was more covert, like Harry and Percy. Neither of them wanted the bouncing ball of destiny and greatness, it just landed in their laps like a hot potato. As Dumbledore would say, \u201cIt is a curious thing, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.\u201d Thomas is the same. Yes, he desires to be a Runner, but when it comes down to the heroic shit like that night in the Maze, he bumbles into it, relying on instinct and more luck than skill. This, to me, cancels out the Chosen One mark. I want to see my characters struggle in life-or-death situations, instead being all calm and collected because they have Spesual, Unparalleled Powers. His personality isn't all sunshine and daisies either. I don't mean in a woe-is-me-I'm-special, whiny, emo way, but more endearing and realistic. He gets confused and frustrated. He lashes out at people and even thinks his only friend is annoying sometimes. Not condescendingly, but like when you have a bad day and your kid is just so freaking annoying! It's human nature. The setting is fantastic. I love Lord of the Flies and the Glade mirrors that perfectly. A bunch of boys marooned in a place and forced to survive in their own. Though they're far more organized and capable, even when THINGS happen later. \"Order,\" Newt continued. \"Order. You say that bloody word over and over in your shuck head. Reason were all sane around here is cause we work out butts off and maintain order.\" The sole thing I didn't enjoy was the romance element. It stank of insta-love because Thomas thinks he knows the girl, Teresa, from somewhere in the depths of his memory, but can't get a grip on it. Sort of like soulmate in a previous life stuff. I understand it's part of the overarching plot and will be explained in later books, but it still got on my nerves even with it having a minimal screentime. If The Maze Runner were in Teresa's POV, I suspect it will be more romance-based because the main connotation with her character is as Thomas's object of affection and mystery. Not that I don't like her (she has her kick-ass moments), but it still doesn't sit well with me. But it's very tiny problem and I really enjoyed The Maze Runner. If you love dystopians with an endearing hero (who will be played by the fantastic Dylan O'Brien in the movie adaption) and a Lord of the Flies twist, give this a try. As for me, I'll be jumping straight to the sequel. Yes. Yes, you are.

The writing was meh, I didn't particularly care about the characters and felt they were a bit dull and not very fleshed out, and the whole \"withholding information\" plot device was just painful. It wasn't mind blowing or anything, but a fun read nonetheless. You know the moment you are reading a book and you are hooked? You NEED to know what is going on....you are desperate. Your heart starts pounding, you can't breathe easily, you are gasping for air, anxiety takes hold of you, and you are on the edge of your seat?

You NEED to know what is going on....you are desperate. Your heart starts pounding, you can't breathe easily, you are gasping for air, anxiety takes hold of you, and you are on the edge of your seat? Please tell me that I am not the only one....although that does sound mildly reminsicent of my asthma attack last year at kickboxing class...but I digress. This crazy edge of my seat, NEED TO KNOW NOW experience was how I felt about this book. I was enthralled. I lost an entire day and night to this incredible book. James Dashner's The Maze Runner was truly addicting and an unforgettable read. Thomas can't remember where he came from, his parents, or his life before the Glade. He finds himself in this bizarre world surrounded by walls and a maze. There are other boys in his situation (think Lord of the Flies) and they have learned to make this place \"home.\" What is even more disturbing is the fact that there are crazy animal-monsters called Grievers that surround the Glade's walls and come out at night with basically one mission: To destroy humans. I'm going to be honest. The Grievers are the stuff of my own personal nightmares. Seriously. I have an irrational fear of needles and I also don't enjoy slugs. at. all. The description of these Grievers included both needles and slugs; needless to say, I vomited in my mouth a little just reading/imagining these volatile creatures. Anyway, Thomas is learning the ropes and becomes friends Chuck and Minho, who both happen to be my favorite characters. Chuck is just simply endearing. Thomas really wants to be a runner and work with Minho, but he isn't sure why he is drawn to the job. There are various jobs and the way the Glade functioned I thought was pretty interesting. These boys even have their own slang/vernacular (klunk-love it!) as well as laws, which keeps the \"order.\" Everything seems hunky dory- or as normal as possible if you live in a maze- until one day this all changes. A girl, the first girl ever, arrives to the Glade delivering an ominous message. Without giving too much away, the tension increases and their world turns upside down, even more than it already is! Simply stated......Thomas must find a way to survive. I can't remember the last time that I questioned a book so much as I did while reading this novel. I had SO many questions that I wanted answered, but brilliantly, Dashner was holding out on me, which only increased my suspense. I'm going to get a little nerdy and teacher-eque, but bear with me. I also loved the fact that this book required me to use many comprehension strategies. I would LOVE to discuss this book with my literacy classes, because it really required me to infer, question, synthesize, predict, etc. It was truly a smart read and a puzzle that I was dying to put together. My poor husband, Mike, had to deal with my one million questions. Mike, surprisingly, read this book before me, which usually never happens. He saw the cover, read the synopsis and was hooked. So, it was pretty cool to be able to discuss and question him as I was reading, because Maze Runner is truly a book to be disected and discussed. This story had me guessing the ENTIRE time, which I think is rare when it comes to young adult novels. Ususally you can figure out the plot at some point, but I was always shocked. Even right up to the end had me guessing. I'm not kidding- even on the last page I was wondering a few things. It was a roller coaster ride that never once let me catch my breath. After my raving review, which I shared with my students, a boy immediately snagged my copy of this book. I think my students will love it! Many people are comparing this book to Hunger Games and yes, both are dystopias, but both are extremely different. For starters, there really isn't a love triangle in Maze Runner and there's a barely there love interest, which I found to be refreshing. I needed a break from the drama-laden love triangles. Just like Hunger Games, this book focuses on survival of the fittest, but the Maze Runner has a whole different premise. I must admit, this book had me questioning way more than Hunger Games did. Don't get me wrong, I still love me some Katniss, but this book definitely gave Hunger Games a run for its money. ...more", "Title": "The Maze Runner"},
