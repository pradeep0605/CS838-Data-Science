I was in a Chapters bookstore in Toronto (that's like Barnes and Noble to the Americans in the crowd) and anyway I was just browsing around, trying to kill time. When suddenly I saw this nice display of red books with an upturned dog on the cover. Attracted as always to bright colours and odd shapes, I picked it up. It's only about 250 pages or so. I read the back cover and was intrigued. I flipped through the pages and noticed that it had over One Million chapters.<---F> I was doubly intrigued</---F>. So I walked over to the far wall of the bookstore to sit and begin to read a few pages. I always do this to ensure that I don't waste what little money I have on a book possessing nothing more than a flashy cover. (I do the same at the cinema - if I don't like the first 20 minutes, I get a refund. Restaurants, too: if I don't like the first ten bites, I walk out on the bill). This is a book written by a Child Developmental Psychologist - I think that's the right term... - anyway, a doctor who works with mentally or physically challenged youngsters. The novel itself is a first person tale written by a high-functioning, mentally challenged boy in England who wakes up one morning to find his neighbor's dog dead on his lawn. The boy's teacher suggests he should write about the incident, which he eagerly sets out to do. So we have his first \"novel\", \"<+++>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</+++>\". He plays Inspector and tries to solve the mystery as Sherlock Holmes would do... Of course,<---M> if he's going to write a book</---M>, that means he can take control. He hates the way other books have chapter numbers that increase sequentially (1,2,3). He prefers prime numbers and will number his chapters in sequential primes - hence, by the end of the book, you're reading chapter 123,314,124 or whatever (I ain't no math guy ;) Now then, he also writes about other things in his life and through his perspective you get some tear-jerking moments of true, unobstructed humanity: the way his parents broke up because of his state, how he has all these dreams about being someone great and going to a top college, even though you know that his situation will never really allow it. Anyway. I read this book cover to cover sitting on the floor of that Chapters bookstore. By the end of it I was absolutely bawling my eyes out. Never cried so much in my life. In fact, as I type this and think back on that story, I'm dripping on my keyboard (and I'm at my office!). However - these are tears of joy. The boy does it. He can do anything. It's the most uplifting book I've ever read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels anything deep down inside. ...more Absolute garbage.

I\u2019d seen this book prominently featured at many shops (mayhap Oprah was currently endorsing it as worthy fare), so when I saw a copy at a resale shop for \u2018fitty\u2019 cents, I figured some poor sucker out there somehow managed to prove they know less about the value of a dollar than I do. This was both slick and sweet, even if the book blew, I could probably unload it on ebay and manage to actually make some money out of the deal. In that circumstance I\u2019d place my first call home in 2008; my folks would be so proud to see my enterprising nature finally surface. I will not be selling this book, as my conscience won\u2019t let me dupe someone quite that badly. I will instead be using it as kindling for the next bonfire I start while camping. This would be fitting, seeing as I read it while camping over Memorial Day weekend, and I would have rightfully disposed of this in the fire at that time, except I wasn\u2019t completely finished suffering through it until the drive home. Also, I had nothing else to read. I can say that this book taught me one thing; I solemnly vow only to bring a book I enjoy while secluded from the outside world from this day forth. This is about the third time I\u2019ve gone camping and brought some utter crap along, only to wish I had anything else, hell, I\u2019d have started reading the damn bible if it meant forsaking \u201cThe Curious Incident..\u201d Much less, during this ill-fated camping trip, the Midwest was being absolutely hammered with inclement weather of all sorts. Tornados were tearing the ass out of Iowa, both Wisconsin and Illinois were flooding to the point that if I actually had been reading the bible I'd have contemplated the construction of an ark, Michigan was being devastated by \u2018ball-lightning\u2019 and thunderstorms a-plenty, and Indiana, well, Indiana sucks no matter what the weather is, even if beset by an event similar to that legendary whack shit in Tunguska it could only serve to make the place slightly more interesting to inhabit. Rather comically, the campground had a good number of \u2018seasonal\u2019 campers (aka total hicks) that were just chilling in their trailers, sporting mullets and getting all stoked to some Kid Rock. While hail pummeled the area, t-storms unleashed an epic deluge, and tornados were spotted touching down and killing people, the hicks took all this in perfect stride. \u201cGit r done! Git on \u2018ere!\u201d they hooted merrily, apparently oblivious to the fact that their lives were potentially in jeopardy. In these conditions not a single one bothered to put on a shirt, seemed completely content to sit on their cooler and polish off their 12-pack of Coors, and didn\u2019t mind their inbred, unkempt kids running around barefoot and sopping wet, certain to die of pneumonia should god decide (for some unfathomable reason) not to reclaim their souls with his twister. The women, predominantly pregnant, were also unfazed, brazenly ignoring the reports of nearby boy scouts getting killed and also gleefully chugging Coors, which I\u2019m sure will only assist in assuring that the next generation of scruffy bastards hailing from Elk\u2019s Ass, Illinois to be just as pitiful as their progenitors. In order to blend in with the natives, I peeled off my top, kicked off my shoes, scratched my nuts generously before picking my nose, and continued drinking, acting as nonchalant as possible in 90 mph winds while getting pulverized with all forms of precipitation. For some reason I was still regarded with suspicion by the locals, and it wasn\u2019t until later that I realized that the clue that tipped them off that I wasn\u2019t one of their ilk was the act of reading. I wonder, when they embrace this uppity act of reading themselves will they begin noticing the surgeon general\u2019s warnings that smoking and guzzling hooch shouldn\u2019t be the norm for the preggers in their clan? That\u2019s not really my problem, but I'll remain slightly concerned as these freaks only live about a hundred miles away. As a bonus for anyone sticking it out this far in eager anticipation of something which might resemble rationale for why \u201cThe Curious Incident\u2026\u201d sucked so bad (in my estimation), I shall now present it. I\u2019d also like to note that the uncomfortable expectation of being leveled by a tornado is about five hundred times more enjoyable than this book. Thus begins the part of the review that I\u2019m assuming will prompt the parents of autistic people worldwide to recommend I go fuck myself, to which I\u2019ll just let them know right now that if I could, I wouldn\u2019t be dicking around on goodreads. If my simple-minded slander is going to bother you, go find something more worthwhile to do. First, by page twenty-five I was just sick of the all the words in bold and all the diagrams and illustrations. Yes, I understand that the story is told from the point of view of an autistic kid, it would be damned hard not to grasp that, but was it really necessary? Is this supposed to be representative of how autistic people think? Who the hell knows, but I personally found it annoying. Secondly, I was also bothered by little <---C>Christopher</---C> rambling on and on about Super Good Days and Black Days and his favorite colors. I didn\u2019t like him rapping about his skills at Minesweeper and \u2018doing maths\u2019 and his proficiency at \u2018groaning\u2019. I will give the author kudos that the story was every bit as demanding as dealing with someone with autism, laying belly-down on the floor like a lowly reptile and groaning after seeing a brown paper bag. \u201cGreat, you don\u2019t like brown since shit happens to be brown-hued, let\u2019s move on...Seriously.....No, seriously. Dude, I\u2019m not kidding anymore, I get it, you\u2019re not telling me anything new here....Ok, last time, bro, you say it one more time I swear I\u2019ll kick you in the eye.\u201d If I can collectively congratulate society on one decision in the past decade, it would have to be their refusal to allow me to teach \u2018special education\u2019. True, I haven\u2019t applied for that unsavory post, but I\u2019m sure anyone could realize that the result would be messier than providing a cage of chimps with ready-made shitballs. Lastly, this autistic kid is walking around with a knife throughout the book and ceaselessly contemplating shanking strangers with it. This (honestly) just absolutely offends me. I\u2019ll make a fair trade; if I can\u2019t drive drunk, autistic people shouldn\u2019t be allowed possession of a knife (or anything more lethal than a wiffle-ball bat). I\u2019m not about to start segregating the results of stupid people liable to make a stupid decision ruining someone else\u2019s livelihood into degrees of malicious intent. Anyway, little Christopher is writing a \u2018mystery\u2019 story at the behest of his teacher, and the recent murder of his neighbor\u2019s dog, Wellington, seems like a good enigma to solve. This whole mystery is solved quickly and rather lamely within the story, which is fittingly moronic considering the whole work. From there, Christopher goes on a quest to find his mother, whom he believed deceased, which is absolute crap. This kid\u2019s presence begins to screw up her life, her new lover\u2019s life, and eventually sprawls out to ruin his father\u2019s life, and yes, my life too. It even managed to ruin my girlfriend\u2019s life, as I took my frustrations out by grudge-fucking her to a Helmet album on the rocky and inundated soil of the campsite. In the end, his parents make the haughty decision to try making this kid\u2019s life fulfilling once again. Christ. A happy ending to this drek was genuinely soul-destroying. I\u2019d have preferred something darker; an historical account of an autistic person prior to the recent mollycoddling. It seems like all I hear about these days are autistic kids, and I wonder why history isn\u2019t choc full of anecdotal tales of their presence, where did they all come from? I can only speculate that prior to 1850, once a child displayed the symptoms of autism they were unceremoniously dragged to the nearest river and drowned, or smothered with hay. A story like that would be solid. Imagine this, caveman Thok is hella hungry, and there\u2019s Oog, banging his head on the wall groaning, per usual. Thok comes home with one-slain-gazelle-a-week for the tribe, and Oog\u2019s only contribution is a lot of noise and gibberish, and an appreciable skill of identifying prime numbers, which haven\u2019t been conceptualized and aren\u2019t worth much of a damn. But, today, Oog still has a hunk of some unlucky critter\u2019s hindquarters left over from their recent feast, just laying there looking to be devoured. Pick your own ending of this tragic tale: A) Thok steals the meat and Oog continues groaning, even louder and more gratingly now that he\u2019s hungry. B) Thok finds the nearest sizable stone and bludgeons Oog to death, resulting in an immediately full belly for the hearty hunter and about 85 edible pounds of meat for future consumption should the herd they are stalking decide to take to the hills. C) Thok befriends Oog, begins teaching him the tribe\u2019s language, and Oog eventually ascends to the position of Grand Pooba of the clan, inventing the wheel, harnessing the power of fire, and pushing the frontiers of rocketry to levels still unachieved through his mathematical genius (usually accompanied by groaning). Anyone reading this should be subjected to someone groaning in close proximity until they stop. Then they can tell me how cool that shit is. ...more The Prime Reasons Why I Enjoyed <---A>Mark Haddon</---A> 's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time : 2.

He loves Sherlock Holmes and is amazingly observant of tiny details, but his lack of insight into other people's emotional lives hampers his investigation. Nevertheless, he has to overcome some of his deepest habits and fears, and he also uncovers some unexpected secrets. It is primarily a YA book, but there is more than enough to it to make it a worthwhile adult read as well. Prime Chapters and Structural Quirks The structure of the book (chapter numbers are all primes; inclusion of maths puzzles and diagrams) and narrative style (attention to detail, excessive logic, avoidance of metaphor) reflect Christopher's mindset and way of viewing life. It is peppered with snippets of maths and explanations of his condition: how it affects him, and what coping strategies he adopts. The effect is plausibly stilted and occasionally breathless, which is reminiscent of people I know who are on the autistic spectrum and tallies with my limited reading about the condition. (Note that neither autism nor Asperger's is mentioned by name in the book, although in my first edition, neurologist Oliver Sacks does mention it in a quote on the front cover.) Honest but Unreliable Narrator? Christopher's condition makes him very literal - something he is aware of. He can analyse a joke, but still not \"get\" it. Truth is paramount, so he hates situations where he can't tell the truth (e.g. for politeness) and indeed the fact that \"everything you tell is a white lie\" because you can never give a fully comprehensive answer to anything. He also hates metaphors (even \"the word metaphor is a metaphor\", meaning \"carrying something from one place to another\"), but he doesn't mind similes because they are not untrue. Christopher's feelings about metaphors are highly pertinent to a very different book, China Mieville's wonderful \"Embassytown\" ( http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... ), which is about how minds shape language and how language shapes minds, and focuses on the relationship between similes, truth and lies. Many novels are about uncovering what is true, but Christopher's quest takes the idea to a deeper level, and even though we know this narrator is almost pathologically truthful, his condition means his observations sometimes miss the real truth of a situation. There is plenty of humour, and it usually arises from Christopher's naive misunderstandings of situations and the conflict between his lack of embarrassment and desire to be unnoticed by unfamiliar people. Logic and Truth Christopher loves maths because it is safe, straightforward and has a definite answer, unlike life. He's also good at explaining some aspects, ending an explanation of calculating primes with \"Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away\". His apparent deviations from logic are justified with ingenious logic. For example, having favourite and hated colours reduces choice and thus stress, counteracting the effect of his inability to filter or prioritise: he notices (and remembers) every detail of everything, and can rewind it at will, whereas other people's brains are filled with imaginary stuff. He is a little like his hero Sherlock Holmes, who is quoted saying \"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance observes\". Similarly, defining a good or bad day on the basis of how many red or yellow cars is no more illogical than an office-bound person's mood being dictated by the weather. All of this means animals are a better bet than humans: \"I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking - it has four moods. Happy, sad, cross and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk\". People are more of a mystery: when having a conversation, people look at him to understand what he's thinking, but Christopher can't do likewise. For him \"it's like being in a room with a one-way mirror in a spy film\". Love is even more unfathomable: \"Loving someone is helping them when they get into trouble, and looking after them, and telling them the truth, and Father [does lots of things for me]... which means that he loves me\". Comparisons I reread this during a rather stressful journey, including the passages when Christopher is making a stressful journey. It helped me empathise with him - to the extent that it exacerbated my own stress! It's worth comparing this with Iris Murdoch's The Word Child ( http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... ), whose main character has tacit Asperger's tendencies, and The Housekeeper and the Professor ( http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... ), which is also about finding number patterns in everyday life, and involves a protagonist whose brain does not work like other people's. ...more The concept is interesting: narrating the novel through the POV of an autistic boy.

I guess my disappointment lies in the fact that not only did my book club tout this as a mystery novel but also many of the literary reviews I read as well. What I was expecting was an exciting roller coaster ride mystery about an autistic boy trying to find the killer of his neighbor's dog and, as he slowly sleuths out the killer, finds himself embroiled in dangerous life threatening situations. Kind of like Tartt's The Little Friend told from an autistic POV. However, The Curious Incident... is not a mystery in any way, shape or form and because of this, the autistic POV begins to wear thin by the second half of the novel remaining sometimes fascinating yet sometimes tedious. Instead, you get a novel that starts off as a promising murder mystery. At the first half of the novel, the mystery is solved. Or rather we're unceremoniously told who is the murderer of the dog. From that point, the second half of the novel hugely focuses on Christopher attempting to travel to London by himself. A difficult task considering Christopher is autistic, hates crowds and can't stand to be touched by people. I won't tell who the murderer is or why Christopher takes off to London, as these are the only two real surprises of the novel. I will say overall this was a huge disappointment to me. I thought I was getting an exciting murder mystery and instead I got a highly readable family melodrama. Perhaps if this was not pushed as a murder mystery I would have enjoyed it much more. An interesting read but I wouldn't recommend it. ...more Am I autistic? Am I Christopher Boone? What is it about my OCD (self-diagnosed, boo yah!) that separates me from this fifteen-year-old kid?

Kapitoil was close, but The Curious Incident paints a more complete picture. The book is from the viewpoint of an teen boy with Asperger's syndrome named Christopher - his mom has recently died and he discovers a dead dog in one of his neighbor\u2019s yards. The short list: he doesn\u2019t read people\u2019s emotions very well (like the android \u201cData\u201d from Star Trek next Generation, if you will), he hates the colors yellow and brown, excels at math, hates to be touched (enter the fist: he breaks out a pretty nasty uppercut when it happens) and often loses his memory when he gets upset. Like many teenage boys, he dreams of long periods of alone time. Since he doesn\u2019t care much about other people\u2019s emotions, he goes around knocking on doors in his neighborhood to ask who killed the dog. So he has your attention right away. He\u2019s a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, who he perceives as the master of objective details that others overlook. Except that no one wants to tell him anything about the dog except the kindly, lonely old Mrs. Alexander, who finally breaks it to the boy that his mom was cheating on his dad. Then a lot more rains down. The dad comes across as calm, especially to a young kid, yet is passive-aggressive person who doesn\u2019t always realize how much clarity his son needs. When he tells Christopher to \u201cdrop all this investigation nonsense\u201d, the son considers what he finds out from Mrs. Alexander as \u201csmall talk\u201d and not what his dad forbade - \u201csnooping around\u201d the neighborhood asking about a dead mutt. In fact, the father\u2019s passive-aggressiveness and the son\u2019s determination and objectivity make for heartbreaking tension. The crux of the story isn\u2019t about the dog, it\u2019s what the dad keeps from Christopher \u201cuntil he gets old enough to understand\u201d. Even though he\u2019s autistic, we find out that Christopher is old enough to know anything - and will go way out of his way to find the truth. This is a book that doesn\u2019t end neatly and nicely because life usually doesn\u2019t turn out that way. It just sort of ends. We learn a lot about autism, it\u2019s very defined characteristics and why it\u2019s so difficult for \u2018normal\u2019 people to be around. There is no one in the story who treats Christopher the way he wants to be treated except a counselor at school. This is a good story in which we learn a lot about this condition. If the story needs to stall because the narrator is stuck on telling all the facts of a particular situation, then that\u2019s what happens. You don\u2019t necessarily comprehend why everything is written the way it\u2019s written, but it somehow all feels important by the end. I raced through everything regardless. And the boy\u2019s objectivity lends a prophetic feel to some of the things he says. He wonders why people think they\u2019re superior to animals, for example. His thinking is that in a couple of centuries the human race might evolve to where the human beings of today end up on display in a zoo. And if we all kill each other through war or wearing out the planet, then insects could end up being the most superior creatures on earth. He has interesting theories on the constellations, the Big Bang theory, major religions, etc. Sure, a general comparison could be made to the movie \u201cRainman\u201d, except that this book gives complete attention to the afflicted character, Christopher. It breaks down one of society\u2019s more recent creations - the mental institution, one of the big barriers between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. You discover there\u2019s a ton of humanity and things to consider and learn from someone you may have previously been too nervous to be around. ...more Ok, I get the concept.

I'm smart, I'm educated. I'm a professional woman who adores literature and loves to read. I bought this book because I was told that it was GREAT by a couple of friends. I'd also read the reviews. I'll give it a shot, ok? Ack. It took me a full month to get through this book. This from someone who can devour a book in twelve hours (including \"masterpieces\" such as Memoirs of a Geisha, Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice....loved them all). I didn't like it. I didn't find it \"lyrical\" I didn't find the writing in ANY way \"superior\" to some of the \"genre\" authors I read (Nora Roberts anyone?). It left me depressed and out of sorts. And a little pissed off. If that's what makes a \"Classic\" these days, please count me out. I'll stick with my \"silly\" genre novels ANY day of the week. ...more You can't please everyone, and I guess books can be a good example of that statement. I know a lot of people who liked this book very much, but on the other hand, I also know a few people who would not hesitate to burn this book. I'm on the positive side. I really enjoyed this short novel. I've said this numerous times in my other reviews that I like character driven novels. This book obviously focused on Christopher's development more than the plot's.

I really enjoyed this short novel. I've said this numerous times in my other reviews that I like character driven novels. This book obviously focused on Christopher's development more than the plot's. The author succeeded, because I've gotten attached to the little kiddo. I have a soft spot for people, more on children, with disabilities. I can't stomach to be annoyed at them because it's not something they can control. While I don't know anyone personally with autism, the author managed to give justice to the sickness. It's not the best book on autism, but it's a short preview of it. I honestly don't like reading huge novels during the school year. I'd rather read those gigantic books during my breaks because I tend to enjoy them better when read at my own pace. Reading is not a task for me, but it's something that I consider to be leisure. Stress from the university is not something I could control, so reading shorter novels help me unwind at times. It's actually my exam week next week but I managed to squeeze this book in my hectic schedule. I didn't feel like rushing because it was so short to begin with. Aside from being short, it was also really entertaining. Like I said, it's not a novel that everyone's going to love, but I'd recommend taking the risk and find out for yourself. Sometimes the opinion of others may seem right, but in the end it's all about what the novel made you feel after reading. You don't have to go with the flow and hate on something you actually like. ...more \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0631\u0642 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0643 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u062a\u0647

My older sister is intellectually disabled, I grew up a science nerd and my daughter is a Sherlock Holmes nut. While I was reading it the central character seemed a strange fusion of the three of us. This book has so many resonances for me that when I get old and dotty I may even think that I wrote it. (if I thought I could get away with it I would start claiming this now...) If you haven't read this book and have been put off because you think it's a children's book or it sounds a bit silly - don't put it off any longer. It is a beautifully written story that is moving without playing any cheap games with you as a reader. Look, it is a delight.

Very moving. I have now read this several times, just read it for my fall YA class. My feeling this time? That almost half of the book is about the London trip when Christopher goes to see his estranged mother, and maybe that's a little too long, it makes the story into a kind of movie thriller of sorts, when the heart of the book is about mysteries, a dog murdered, relationships, love, the grief and despair of dealing with a kid with special needs, that heartbreak, all stuff I have been through. One thing that is different in recent readings is that I have watched and rewatched the BBC Sherlock and the American Elementary and I have this as background for a very Sherlock focused book (it's Christopher's favorite set of stories). I also have been reading Agatha Christie Poirot mysteries, so I have that related background. And, one course I have been teaching focuses on the relationships between psychiatry, the psychic/supernatural, horror/fantasy, spirituality, the literar vs the rational and logical, and some of that figures very much in this book. I had forgotten he talks of faith and ghosts in this book with respect to logic and Reason. This is a very cool (and for me, moving) book for young people and adults that I highly recommend. I admit to tears in several places, earned tears from Haddon. ...more The first 50% percent of this novel was quite compelling, mainly because of the narrator.

It is not mentioned what type of developmental disorder Christopher, our narrator, has but his behavior is indicative of either Autism or Asperger's. Regardless of what he has, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time gives us a first person perspective of the day-to-day life of someone with developmental disorders. However, a book needs more than a unique POV and narrative style to earn more than three stars from this broad. The novelty of a non-emotional narrative quickly faded to reveal a lackluster plot and an anti-climactic ending. ...more This one of the editorial acquisitions I'm most proud of... I've bought rights for this novel while it was still in manuscript, before first publication and much before all the awards it received later... Also, I had the pleasure of meeting Mark Haddon twice... His a great author and very nice person and has good memory :) Unfortunately, he didn't sell well in Serbia... I changed him a publisher but with no better results... Due to bad sales he won't be translated into Serbian, most probably :( A very charming, insightful, engaging book. From the perspective of a 15-year-old boy who has a kind of high-functioning autism (which may not be autism, actually, but Asberger's?). Some mature themes.

From the perspective of a 15-year-old boy who has a kind of high-functioning autism (which may not be autism, actually, but Asberger's?). Some mature themes. Here are some of my favorite quotes: \u201cFor example, this morning for breakfast I had Ready Brek and some hot raspberry milk shake. But if I say that I actually had Shreddies and a mug of tea (footnote: But I wouldn\u2019t have Shreddies and tea because they are both brown.) I start thinking about Coco Pops and lemonade and porridge and Dr Pepper and how I wasn\u2019t eating my breakfast in Egypt and there wasn\u2019t a rhinoceros in the room and Father wasn\u2019t wearing a diving suit and so on and even writing this makes me feel shaky and scared, like I do when I\u2019m standing on the top of a very tall building and there are thousands of houses and cars and people below me and my head is so full of all these things that I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to forget to stand up straight and hang on to the rail and I\u2019m going to fall over and be killed. This is another reason why I don\u2019t like proper novels\u2026\u201d pg. 19 \u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t clever. I was just noticing how things were, and that wasn\u2019t clever. That was just being observant. Being clever was when you looked at how things were and used the evidence to work out something new. Like the universe expanding, or who committed a murder. Or if you see someone\u2019s name and you give each letter a value from 1 to 26 (a = 1, b =2, etc.) and you add the numbers up in your head and you find that it makes a prime number, like Jesus Christ (151), or Scooby-Doo (113), or Sherlock Holmes (163), or Doctor Watson (167). Mr. Jeavons asked me whether this made me feel safe, having things always in a nice order, and I said it did. Then he asked if I didn\u2019t like things changing. And I said I wouldn\u2019t mind things changing if I became an astronaut, for example, which is one of the biggest changes you can imagine, apart from becoming a girl or dying.\u201d pg. 25 \u201cMrs. Alexander didn\u2019t say anything. She walked to the little red box on a pole next to the gate to the park and she put Ivor\u2019s poo into the box, which was a brown thing inside a red thing, which made my head feel funny so I didn\u2019t look. Then she walked back to me.\u201d pg. 57 \u201cOn the fifth day, which was a Sunday, it rained very hard. I like it when it rains hard. It sounds like white noise everywhere, which is like silence but not empty.\u201d pg. 103 \u201cAnd when I am in a new place, because I see everything, it is like when a computer is doing too many things at the same time and the central processor unit is blocked up and there isn\u2019t any space left to think about other things. And when I am in a new place and there are lots of people there it is even harder because people are not like cows and flowers and grass and they can talk to you and do things that you don\u2019t expect, so you have to notice everything that is in the place, and also you have to notice things that might happen as well. And sometimes when I am in a new place and there are lots of people there it is like a computer crashing and I have to close my eyes and put my hands over my years and groan, which is like pressing CTRL + ALT + DEL and shutting down programs and turning the computer off and rebooting so that I can remember what I am doing and where I am meant to be going.\u201d pgs. 143-144 ...more

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is unlike most books that you'll find at your local shop on the subject of autism.

While the concept sounds like a children's mystery I must have been recommended this book annually. Considering the rate at which I devour books, it is a shame that I didn't take those recommendations to heart until recently. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is unlike most books that you'll find at your local shop on the subject of autism. Our story follows the exceptionally unique narrator Christopher Boone as he tries to unravel the mystery of who killed a dog on his street. While the concept sounds like a children's mystery novel, the entire concept is elevated by Christopher's narration which provides a distinctive view into the mind of an individual with autism. The chapters are not presented in sequential numbers, rather they are presented as ascending prime numbers (Christopher quite enjoys math). Occasionally, Christopher's sparse descriptive passages are supplemented by small drawings, graphs and figures. Christopher struggles with the overwhelming societal rules that everyone else seems to be following with ease. Quirks like this appear throughout the book and help establish Christopher as one of the most stylistically impressive narrators in recent memory. Despite Christopher's protestations early in the novel that he is unable to tell a joke, the novel is filled with laughs. Despite the levity of some of the situations in which our hero finds himself, the obsessions and patterns to which Christopher is bound reflect genuine autistic traits. Though Christopher processes emotion differently from most people, the novel is also full of heart and heartbreaking moments. Most of the emotional gravitas is provided by the supporting cast as their personal struggles are brought to the forefront via the narrator's matter-of-fact writing. Indeed, while Christopher's narration provides heartfelt insight into the mind of an autistic teenager, the stories of his parents tell of the difficulties of raising an autistic child. This book also reads like a thriller: it is short, compelling, mysterious, and the pages flew by once I got a hang of the unique style. This novel is highly entertaining, refreshing, profound, and well-researched. Mark Haddon hit a homer with this one, and I wish I had taken all the recommendations earlier.

Combine that with all the hilarious investigations that would occur from someone severely lacking social skills and attempting to run an investigation (which Haddon expertly captures), and it makes for an unforgettably fun adventure. But since Haddon narrates through Christopher's eyes, more often than not the Asperger's is distracting or worse yet annoying and preachy. The frequent digressions make a lot of the story seem like forgettable fluff. But when the narration is just right, it's pretty freaking comical, like Ace Ventura, but way better. ...more This book was not for me. The main character is just not fun to read about in any way.

I was very surprised to read some of the reviews on this site dissing this book, especially the review where someone mentioned it was for \"Literary Snobs.\" I couldn't disagree with that more. I think it's possible that it was recommended to that reviewer by a \"literary snob\" and therefore, she got that impression from that, but I could also be completely wrong. I believe the purpose of this book wasn't even to make a huge literary statement, but to broaden the general public's understanding of what it might be like to have autism. The author worked for many years very closely with individuals with autistim, and he writes the book through the eyes of a 15 year old boy with autism. He describes the world from his vantage point, and uses images to clarify what his thought process is like, which to me give the reader an idea that his line of thinking is much different than the average persons. The story is very simple, but why I think it is written well, is because there always seems to be some level of anticipation as to what is going to happen next. It is at the simplest level a detective story. So, it keeps you wondering why certain things happened to this boy. Like he tells you things, and you yourself think, \"huh, that's kind of odd.\" So, you'll feel a little puzzled at times, but the character keeps investigating and eventually helps himself and the reader understand the whole picture. So anyways, I think it's a great book. My favorite, in fact. ...more Somebody, I can\u2019t recall who, has said that fiction is successful with people in as so far as their ability to show compassion for others \u2013 our very ability to step in to others shoes.

Christopher is rendered too different from us by his circumstances \u2013 the problems he faced are not ones we had to face, and so it must be that difficult for a writer to step into his shoes. C. is a differently-able fifteen ear old boy; who can\u2019t bear crowds or strangers. Also, he can only understand words in their literal sense- so, he has problems with metaphors including expressions like \u2018apple of eye\u2019 or vague xpressions. This sometimes makes him an innocent quibbler \u2013 to fury of his parents. His inability to filter the information his mind is receiving makes him anxious in new places. Also, he has a problem using what is called \u2018Theory of mind\u2019 \u2013 the assumption (which in usual cases is acquired in children by age of three) that other people have a mind of their own; and which also another thing which help enjoy fiction. So, Christopher is not able to enjoy fiction; except for detective novels which he see as puzzles \u2013 and he loves puzzles. These very problems make him excellent with numbers and logic \u2013 far better than most of us; he finds the world of numbers much more secure and likes spending time with them. He likes numerical and visual patterns; and he has a great love for prime numbers because they defy all patterns. He relaxes by solving complex mathematical problems and puzzles. Also, he has an incredible memory. He is a big fan of Sherlock Holmes - who had willingly worked hard to be as logical as Christopher naturally is. The very things that make him different make him more conscious of the way mind work than most people are. All these differences are incapable of beating his courage. He has a goal, that of being an astronaut. We don\u2019t know if he will achieve that goal but he definitely has a genius and a courage that makes so high an aim possible, and a positive attitude that makes him look at problems as puzzles and challenges to be fought. This story is example of the little victories, that he won against his social-anxieties, which can act as stepping stones towards his goal. ...more Final Rating: 3.5 stars Do I have a mild case of Asperger's?

(7) Wanting to be an astronaut as a kid because astronomy and physics made sense . (11) Being such a huge believer in routine and order that if a bottle of water is misplaced on the kitchen counter or the TV stand is slightly awry, I feel disconcerted and uncomfortable until it is put away or straightened. (13) Prime numbers are the coolest. The similarities between Christopher's and my way of thinking makes me wonder if this is really how people with Asperger's think and reason. Did Mark Haddon adopt this familiar thinking pattern to make this book accessible to the readers? Or was it that the author couldn't help but write a novel this way since he doesn't have the syndrome either? I was surprised to read this book from the perspective of a boy with Asperger\u2019s. The little diagrams that Christopher uses to explain the logic games he plays were a refreshing element to the disjointed prose. However, after the initial novelty of the prose waned, I found it harder and harder to finish the book. At first, I found Christopher's lack of empathy interesting, but then I noticed the same pattern emerging again and again: a. Parent says to not doing something. b. Christopher does it anyway. c. Parent gets angry. d. Christopher gets angry. e. Christopher\u2019s anger manifests in black outs. f. A lot of bad feeling results from the Parent. g. Christopher plays with his Swiss knife. It got old pretty quick. A majority of the book focuses on the emotional trauma of the people around him. However, toward the end, when Christopher suffers emotionally from something to the point where it physically affects him, I found myself so numb that I couldn\u2019t properly appreciate with what Christopher is trying to express. Simply, I stopped caring when it mattered . Maybe this emotional state was what Mark Haddon was trying to achieve, but I didn\u2019t feel any particular attachment to the book by the end. Also, I did not like the cursing. I don't mind cursing in general, but so many people yelled and cursed at Christopher that it made me wonder whether Haddon was trying to raise awareness of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome by making people look like jerks. Not cool. Overall, a solid 3.5 stars for the novelty and the entertainment. It was very interesting and very eye opening to go through life from the perspective of a boy with Aspergers.

He loves timetables, dogs, rats, prime numbers and Sherlock Holmes and he hates metaphors (not similes!), noisy places and yellow and brown colors. Through an incident with a dead dog one night, he resolves to turn into a detective to find the cause of the murder and keeps the records of his adventures in a book, \u201cthis book\u201d (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time), which later progresses to a new adventure to find his mom. I haven\u2019t been around autistics and I know very little about the way they look at life. (I\u2019m very interested in paying a short visit to one of these autism clinics in near future.) Through this book I realized that they\u2019re truly amazing! My heart\u2019s for Christopher and all those tens of millions of boys and girls around the globe who can\u2019t connect to our messy wide world but are truly lovable and affectionate. In the following I\u2019ve included some of my favorite lines from the book that might give us a short insight into how these cute special people think and behave: 1. Christopher loves math because it\u2019s predictable, logical and has a definite answer, \"unlike life\" . Of all numbers he loves primes because he thinks \"Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away\". 2. He notices every details, and \"can detach his mind at will\" , whereas \"other people's brains are filled with imaginary stuff\" . He believes that \"the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes\" . He also judges a day to be good or bad by how many red or yellow cars he has seen. 3. He loves animals better that humans: \"I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking - it has four moods. Happy, sad, cross and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk\" . Love has a simple unemotional meaning for him: \"Loving someone is helping them when they get into trouble, and looking after them, and telling them the truth, and Father [does lots of things for me]... which means that he loves me\" . 4. He hates it when he can\u2019t tell the truth, even if it\u2019s only for the sake of politeness. He believes that everything people say is a kind of lie \u2013 a white lie if not the real one. \"A white lie is not a lie at all. It is where you tell the truth but you do not tell all of the truth. This means that everything you say is a white lie\" . ...more", "Title": "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"},
