A cryptic drawing, a treasured notebook, a stolen key, a mechanical man, and a hidden message from Hugo's dead father form Twelve-year-old Hugo, orphan, clock keeper, and thief, has been keeping the clocks running in the walls of a busy Paris train station, where his survival depends on secrets and anonymity. But when his world suddenly interlocks with a mysterious toyseller and his goddaughter, an eccentric, bookish girl, Hugo's undercover life, and his most precious secret, are put in jeopardy. A cryptic drawing, a treasured notebook, a stolen key, a mechanical man, and a hidden message from Hugo's dead father form the backbone of this intricate, tender, and spellbinding mystery. I've been eyeing this book for a few months now, and I was beyond excited to finally have it in my hands because of the gorgeous format it's told through. Here are a few of the many intricate and beautiful illustrations that captured me: \"It's so beautiful,\" said Isabelle. \"It looks like the whole city is made out of stars.\" \"Sometimes I come up here at night, even when I'm not fixing the clocks, just to look at the city. I like to imagine that the world is one big machine. You know, machines never have any extra parts. They have the exact number and type of parts they need. So I figure if the entire world is a big machine, I have to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.\" I also really liked the fact that this book included stills from various films: I know what I'll be watching over the next few days... Lastly, I want to mention that I was really satisfied with that ending because: \u2022 Hugo found his happiness. \u2022 He's among family. \u2022 No unnecessary romance. \u2022 Everyone got their happily ever after (or as close to it as you can get). So I truly cannot wait to pick up more from <---A>Brian Selznick</---A> and see what's next in store. *Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

The book is set in Paris in the 1930s and Hugo is an orphan who only manages to survive each day by clinging to the hope that he will one day fix the automaton his father had been working on... and that it will reveal a hidden message left to him. I had also originally thought that this book was tagged \"historical fiction\" because it happens to be set in the 1930s, but no, there is a real story in here that I found both interesting and educational. Parts of the book managed to achieve that which we all really want from a children's book: magical flair. But other parts fell short of it. I found the ending to be somewhat anticlimatic as well but, on the whole, it was a nice story and I really enjoyed the history lesson behind it. Rounded up to four stars because I'm feeling nice. ...more There is something awesome feeling about getting through 400 pages of a book on an hour lunch break, and still have time to use the bathroom and punch in three minutes early.

So what if the book has lots of illustrations and it's written for children, it's still a real sense of Herculean reading, even if it's not that impressive. I liked this book a lot. I considered giving it five stars. I don't read children or young adult novels so I don't have much to compare it to. The book has much more depth though than This is not a Box , or Don't Give the Cat a Cupcake or even any of the books about that troublesome pigeon who wants to drive the bus and do other things birds aren't supposed to do. This book also is so much better than the first two Harry Potter books, which I have read and didn't care for very much. This book has the a great sense of wonder that adult books like Trip to the Stars has. It also has a feeling of the greatness and mystery of books and stories in general that reading Borges can induce, but this is for kids, which is cool because it's probably good for kids to learn that books are magical and fun at a young age. The pictures that make up about half the book are an interesting device. They do help move parts of the story along, like I think the chase scenes benefit from being done entirely by pictures, reading about a boy running away from someone wouldn't have had the same 'excitement' as in the pictures. I don't know much about kids but I think that the way the book opens with almost fifty pages of pictures gives a great feeling for the book which would be much more difficult to have described for kids in only words. As I said I liked this a lot and the book made me happy that it existed in the world. ...more Words cannot describe how much I loved this book! \u201c<+++>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</+++>\u201d is one of the first chapter books to win a Caldecott Medal and is cleverly written and illustrated by Brian Selznick and it is about how an orphaned boy named Hugo finds out the secrets contained in his most prized possession\u2026a mechanical man from his dead father. \u201c<+++>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</+++>\u201d is clearly one of the most exciting and amazing books ever created for children!

Brian Selznick has created a book that goes beyond what any children\u2019s book has gone before. Brian Selznick has made this story extremely dramatic and exciting at the same time as it details the adventures of an orphaned boy in Paris and how he tries to uncover the mystery of the mechanical man. Brian Selznick makes the characters in this book extremely memorable, especially the main character Hugo Cabret as Hugo is shown as a boy who has a huge ambition and yet he always feels lonely and insecure when he is around other people, since he spent most of his life alone and children will easily sympathize with his situation as any child might feel a bit secluded from other people whenever they lose a loved one. Another memorable character is Isabelle, the toy maker\u2019s daughter who is shown as being a strong heroine and she is always shown yearning for more information about life that she will not let anyone get in her way, including Hugo. Brian Selznick also makes the story extremely creative as the book is set up as two pages are filled with writing while the next few pages are full of illustrations only. Brian Selznick\u2019s illustrations are amazingly beautiful as they are mainly in black and white colors, but the characters look so realistic that they make this book extremely beautiful to look at. The illustrations also help move the story along as there are two pages full of writing while the next four or five pages are full of illustrations that detail what happens in the story and the next few pages are full of writing again while continuing the story. Brian Selznick illustrates the characters\u2019 expressions in such a realistic manner that ranges from shock to happiness that children will easily relate to the characters. \u201cThe Invention of Hugo Cabret\u201d is a truly distinguished children\u2019s book that is ahead of its time and it will always remain to be one of the best books ever created! I would recommend this book to children ages seven and up since the length of this book might bored smaller children.

I put off reading this book for far too long. I've yet to see the movie adaptation but I've had my eye on this book for a while. Finally, I decided to borrow it from my local library and I loved it. Shortly after reading this, I also read Wonderstruck by the same author, which was just as wonderful. It's been a few months since I read both but I can still remember how magical it was and how I fell in love with the story. The book is a chunky one at over 500 pages and it can seem daunting at first but it's actually a very quick read. A wonderful thing about this book is that the story is told through both writing and drawings. The writing style is a simple yet beautiful one, and it's easy to fly through the narrative. The majority of the book consists of illustrations that compliment the narrative beautifully. I love how they focus on particular things, by zooming in with each page, and how they take over from the narrative in various places to illustrate descriptions and events. There's overall a nice tone to the story and the breaks in the text work well. Individually, the book would have been great as a novel or graphic novel but with the two elements combined, it's fantastic. The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a simple yet magical story. There's all kinds of elements to it - it's an adventure/mystery story in a historical setting with a lovely bookish and magical feel to it. It's captivating and easy to read in one sitting. I fell in love with the characters and was enthralled by the story. The Invention of Hugo Cabret was a pleasure to read and I recommend it to everyone. ...more \"The story I am about to share with you takes place in 1931, under the roofs of Paris.

Shortly after the start of the story we learn that twelve-year-old Hugo has recently lost his father to a tragic fire. A horologist working for the city's museum, Hugo's father finds an old automaton in the museum's attic one day. Being a clock maker, his father is innately fasinated by the little man that appears to be able to write out a message if he were only restored to his former glory. Having little time on his hands, Hugo's father decides to leave it be. That is until young Hugo begs his father to fix the machine. But one fateful night when Hugo's father is trapped inside the attic a fire breaks out, thus leading to the death of Hugo's father and much regret on Hugo's part for having been the one to convince his father to fix the automaton in the first place. Determined to continue where his father left off, Hugo begins working on the automaton by night while taking care of the city's clocks by day. But in order to get the pieces he needs to properly restore the automaton, he must steal from the town's toy vendor. This leads to discoveries Hugo never could've imagined, new friendships, and a promising future for our young hero. Although he has previously illustrated other authors' works, The Invention of Hugo Cabret is Brian Selznick's first full children's novel. It contains over 280 drawings, film stills, and what Selznick is best known for, stunning illustrations such as these: Huge reminded me of Harry Potter a bit. Not in the wizardry kind of way, of course, but in the fact that they're both young, they've both lost their parents, and they're both very endearing and seem to call forth the reader's sympathy with great aptitude. They're the kind of boy you'd want to adopt and give a better life to; in other words, my favorite sort of character to read about. Hugo's story is an enchanting journey that will have readers of all ages cheering for its characters and wanting more from Selznick. If you're looking to follow up this book, the movie adaptation, simply titled Hugo , is directed by Martin Scorsese and will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray February 28, 2012. ...more I read the entire book in a few hours this afternoon; despite being about 500 pages it only has about 26,000 words and much of the page space is taken up with interesting formatting as well as sketches that help fill in some scenes of action and emotion to move the plot forward.

At first, I wasn't sure how \"into\" the book I would be; it started a bit slow and gloomy for my taste--yet gradually the mystery pulled me in, little pieces begged to be put together -- like the automaton Hugo means to assemble--I was eager to learn what picture/story Selznick would ultimatley create. I especially appreciated the elements of magic--nothing you'd find in Hogwarts, but rather the magic of the early movies and how they were the stuff that dreams are made on! *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* I skimmed through a copy at a cute, independent bookstore in Napa Valley over the weekend. It's quite the thick and lovely book. Now, a word to the wise--the book has MANY more illustrations than I expected! I was imagining a regular novel, with a sketch or two each chapter. No! Pages and pages of sketches separate chapters--they really DO help tell the story, not just in that they illustrate what is going (like children's picture books) but actually serve to progress the story without using any words... Anyway, it's a very neat idea--I just didn't want anyone to be surprised/disappointed if you were thinking the majority of the book is in traditional novel format. ...more I felt intimidated by the idea of reviewing Hugo Cabret , and wondered if anyone would help me.

However, now that I have said that, the following criticisms that I have for it that have prevented me from giving it 5 stars err on the side of \"overburdening criticism,\" namely that the language was somewhat stilted and the characters weren't particularly well-developed. I also may have a bias because I found Isabelle annoying when she kept insisting that Hugo was a thief and a liar and nagging him to reveal his life story. Related to this is one of the other things that I think would've made this novel better, a more complete, but subtle, address of what I think is an important lesson in the story, that people (Hugo, Isabelle, Papa George, etc.) keep secrets that isolate them from others, that keep themselves from forming deeper personal relationships. Now, after pointing out all these criticisms, let me say that, I loved this book. As it was meant, this book spoke to me through the beautiful pictures. Although I said that the language was stilted, one could argue, is it really a sticking point? If a picture is worth 1,000 words, then Brian Selznick (or, if you've read the novel, Hugo's automaton) has spoken a million words. Although the story was a familiar one insofar as it was reminiscent of a Charles Dickens rags-to-riches story, it explored the rich, largely untapped topic, at least in children's literature, of the beginnings of cinema and the wonder that it inspired. Through his illustrations, especially of the drawings of the labrynthine 1931 Paris train station and ending chase scene (As Hugo states, every movie should end in a good chase scene =), Selznick conveys this wonder, reawakens it, in an audience long accustomed to the magic of movies. Note, I chose to state that Selznick elicits wonder from his audience , not his readers . Initially, I wondered why Selznick didn't use a more standard graphic novel format until I realized, belatedly, that Selznick was using a novel to emulate film to convey the same sense of dreams made real, the feeling that Hugo and his father experienced the first, and every, time that they viewed Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's A Trip to the Moon . Selznick succeeded beautifully; this book is a wondrous one, not only for children, but for adults as well, and also a springboard into the history of the origins of cinema. ...more This massive hardcover might have been worth four stars as a traditional novel, but the whimsical and cinematic illustrations absolutely push this book to a four.

But, well, there wasn\u2019t much of a story and I couldn\u2019t help being a little bit disappointed because I thought I was going to have my socks blown off. However, what story there was was absolutely spectacular. While I was at uni, I studied both English Lit and Film studies, so film will always have a special place in my heart\u2026 especially the earlier ones. Looking at the pictures of the films from the dawn of cinema brought back some really great memories of studying them. It felt like I was back in my university\u2019s library, watching French black and white films on the video players, wearing a pair of rather fetching headphones that took about six minutes to detangle from my hair. Actually, the main reason why I picked this book up at all was because I saw the trailer for the film (directed by Martin Scorsese) and I was completely enchanted. And, if that wasn\u2019t all, I did my dissertation on Scorsese. Coincidence? Probably . I think not. So that was lovely. And so was this book, please don\u2019t get me wrong. I think I had just set my expectations a little too high. The best way I can describe it is a love letter to art, film and magic. I just wish that \u2018story\u2019 had received just a bit more than a ps at the end.

This is the first time I have read it to completion, although last year I read about 70 pages on my first attempt and put it down for a long while and then picked it up again, only to put it down again. I can understand and appreciate why the book won the Caldecott Award, but I do not particularly enjoy the book myself that much, mostly because of the lack of character development and character voice-things the Caldecott Award has nothing to do with. The story is written with such a lack of depth on the part of who the characters are and what their problems really mean to them, that I fail to get involved enough with this book, and it doesn't call to me to pick it up and find out its secrets-all because of character. My complaint with the book has to do with the writing. Its illustrations are glorious to read, fast moving and informative. This book does a great job in fitting the criteria for the award. It is individually distinct in its illustrations and I believe it has conspicuous excellence in many ways, specifically to a child audience. The pictures flow easily from one to the next giving the audience just the right amount of information with which to interpret the significance of each pictoral blip-the zooming in and zooming out of the pictures lends the book a movie quality (which holds interesting significance, as the story pertains to early movies) as does the interesting and original angles from which the \u201cshots\u201d are taken, i.e. through the face of the clock, the penetrating gaze of Hugo creating an interesting parallel with the gaze of the old man and the girl...with special master work painting-like techniques: like the hands of the clock first hinted at in the reflection in Papa Georges' eye. There is even a little dream sequence of pictures in the middle to end of the book which is so movie-like in its quality that you almost feel as if you are having someone else's dream. That is all the work of a masterful illustrator/storyteller. Albeit, one that is not as much a writer/storyteller. Kids of the technology age are so adept at \u201creading\u201d fast-moving visuals from tv, this is like teaching them to read a book (leading them into print literacy) using the skills they have already learned as good tv watchers. A good idea. I love Brian Selznick\u2019s artwork. I particularly enjoy his illustrations in The Doll People series. Probably because I feel that these books were more well-written, I can appreciate the aptness of the illustrations a little more. The pictures and the text are both of the same level of quality. Whereas, in Hugo Cabret, I wanted the writing to be more on par with the quality of the illustrations. Sometimes in the book, I did not feel the \u201cflow\u201d of images as I do in the beginning, when I think it was at its best- with a momentum of storytelling purpose. Although, I still looked forward to them\u2014that is a real draw of this book:looking forward to the illustrations...and it is what also shows me that the writing is just not as skillfully done as the illustrations. I did not want to \u201cread\u201d more words. I wanted to \u201cread\u201d more pictures. I should not belabor the point, but there are many reasons why I put this book down, and still, at this point don\u2019t find myself recommending it to children in the library where I work. First of all being, it is not fun. Yes, the pictures are great and I LOVE the graphic novel format of the book giving the reader a break from all that writing\u2014which for kids can be a real nice thing. Again, I found myself looking ahead to when the next picture sequence would be coming up and telling myself to just make it until the next one. The pictures in this book \u201cread\u201d so much better than the text. They really don't match up in terms of their quality. Tone, yes. Storytelling quality, no. But, to that end\u2014I enjoy recommending The Travels of Thelonious by Schade and the rest of the books in his little trilogy, Faradawn and Simon\u2019s Dream. (I recommend teachers read these\u2014they are so much fun and the kids just eat them up, full of ideas about the future, technology, and taking care of the earth) Selznick's book has all the nice, literary devices of tying up loose ends and giving the readers a piece of the puzzle at a time\u2014but not a whole lot of the feel and taste of what good writing can do to the reader in wanting them to come back to those characters' personalities and internal worlds. That is why I don't come to it as the other librarians do with a big \u201cOh, I know you'll love this!\u201d A main reason I did not enjoy The Invention of Hugo Cabret as much as I felt I should is that the characters just did not engage me. In one way, the pictures led me to this thought as well: the characters of Isabelle and Hugo are drawn so similarly. Their features are almost identical, except for the longer hair and lashes on the girl. I wanted to know them, and the pictures of them did not do a great job in getting me to do that either, to care for them or to be able to distinguish them from anyone else in this world. They are drawn in a kind-of generic fashion. Hugo could have been the boy from Frindle or the boy in Lunch Money just as well. I did not feel even the slightest bit connected to them, and that is partly due to the illustrations. It is too bad. I did not care if Hugo\u2019s hand was broken or if the old man was this famous movie-making pioneer. (By the way, about whom we never knew why his mood and mental state changed so dramatically from before his work was rediscovered to after he was re-recognized). The illustrations could have helped here a little where the writing failed\u2014in getting to know the characters and care about them. Just looking into their well-drawn, similar eyes wasn't enough. The fact remains, I don\u2019t care for Briam Selnick\u2019s writing. It lacks emotional depth and sensitivity. His characters don\u2019t engage me and I feel that they lack depth and show very little development as the book progresses. I find out very little more about Hugo or Isabelle\u2019s real person, at the end as I knew in the beginning. I don\u2019t know their personalities or their way of looking at things. None of the character possess real voice. And I think the book is ultimately lacking in any real voice\u2014there is no tone of the book. It is soundly put together, with all the right pieces in place\u2014it has the neat, cleanly-packaged little surprise ending with the book that we are holding being the work of the automataon that Hugo must have made, that being, the Invention of Hugo Cabret, solving our question from the title. All those perfectly matchy-matchy little pieces fitting so perfectly, like Isabelle having the key for the automaton around her neck, and that Hugo\u2019s father\u2019s favorite movie was George Melie\u2019s mvie and that was who was working in the toy booth. So matchy-matchy. It just doesn\u2019t feel artful to me..it just doesn\u2019t feel. And, I feel badly that it doesn\u2019t and to critique it so harshly in this way. It is not an artful piece of writing to me. It feels nice and neat and contrived and...in this way, it lacks true suspense for me and has no real hold on me. The illustrations cannot save the book as a whole from this fate, and I am beginning to notice that they help keep it there, in fact. The book as a whole just doesn\u2019t really work for me on an abstract-enter-it-into-your-heart-and subconscious level. One of my favorite quotes I read a long time back from someone was about how children's books paint pictures in the soul. I am sure this book may have done this for some people\u2014but, the writing in this book was so lacking of real artful skill, perhaps an abstract and nameless quality, and true voice, and the pictures were well crafted and skillfully sequenced but not expressive just enough so that the book as a whole just did not accomplish this soul-etching for me. It cannot find a nook in my heart like, perhaps, Goodnight Gorilla. The pictures alone can't quite accomplish this for me either. Their sequence is great...but they too often lack voice. The pictures often lack voice. One thing I notice, is the lack of what artist call a contour line or an expressive line. His cross-hatching technique/style is so hazy, that I find myself missing that expressive line that changes in width and darkness as it outlines a shape and lends it, what I would call, voice. I watched a little Brian Selznick video on (I think it was Scholastic) a website, and he told me everything I already thought: his thoughts when it comes to writing are put together in a sort of a dry, premeditated way, incorporating what he learned through his interest in automatons and early film. I wish I could hear him say, \u201cThe characters told me that such and such needed to happen in the story.\u201d or \u201cI felt I got to know Hugo as I was writing this and I wanted to learn more about him myself.\u201d Once again, I just wish he could have had a better hold on me with his writing. But this award is not about that, and so I applaud his work with the illustrations. ...more I'm including this in graphic novels because that is probably the best description for this rather unique book.

It is in many ways a modern fairy tale story and therefore I imagine a great novel for a younger audience. Even reading it now as an eighteen year old; while no longer the little trusting child who loved fairytales I still enjoyed the way Selznick constructed this volume. It was in my eyes a carefully put together piece of art. And even if I found it a little simple for my taste I still award it four stars because I appreciate the beauty of this book and moreover the fact that Selznick is creating artwork that children can enjoy. I know that if I had had this book as a seven year old I would have adored it. On the whole my verdict is that Selznick has created an informative and artistic novel that allows children access to a visually inspiring idea. Perhaps it's not as great a novel for mature adults as other children's/YA's books but it's still a grand book all the same. So I would encourage you to read this while trying to think how you would have enjoyed it as a child and if you have children to read it to them. It's not a long book despite the 500 pages because most of those pages are taken up with large print words or pictures spread across two pages. Afterword - Having just watched the movie I think it's one example where the movie does perfect justice to the book. The book's main strength is the artwork and the film takes that story and makes it a visual artwork Scorsese style! ...more This book is my second book by Selznick and it follows the character of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who is in hiding. Hugo lives at the station and he is in charge of the clocks all over the station. He hides away from everyone as he is basically alone and abandoned and he's doing his drunk uncle's job. Of course, soon Hugo's life of thievery and clockwork is challenged when he is caught thieving. He has quite a few secrets he wants to keep but he soon realises that this is not going to be easy This book is my second book by Selznick and it follows the character of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who is in hiding.

Of course, soon Hugo's life of thievery and clockwork is challenged when he is caught thieving. He has quite a few secrets he wants to keep but he soon realises that this is not going to be easy to do. The story is told half in text and half in images. The images are a stunning pencil style with some truly fantastic cropping and framing making them feel dynamic and essential to the plot. I have to say I love the style. This is my second favourite of the two Selznick books I have so far read, but I know Selznick is fast becoming an auto-buy author for me as his stories and pictures just work so well. I loved the focus of the story and the way it unfolded, just so much adventure and mystery. 4.5*s overall. ...more This odd book is less a novel and more a 500+ page short story, with full page illustrations that make up half the book. These illustrations supposedly tell part of the narrative, but the majority of the information is told in the text, turning what could have been an interesting hybrid of text/illustrated story/graphic novel into a bastard combination that doesn't quite work. The story is quite simple and not very enjoyable.

The story is quite simple and not very enjoyable. Perhaps because I haven't read \"young adult\" books in a long time, perhaps because I was already familiar with automatons and such so there was little new material to get me interested, and what was there was very shallow. Or perhaps because I know a lot about comic books and how \"telling stories by words and pictures\" is supposed to work and can see a lot of flaws. It is a shame, since obviously Brian Selznick put a lot of effort into this book, but it is, to me, a failed experiment. ...more Such a great book!

unable to close it until I'd seen Hugo's story through. Touching story, beautiful illustrations and thoughtful writing. Brilliant book, with probably the most wonderful, true film adaptions I've ever seen. Please experience them both, because you will absolutely not regret a second of your time with either. I\u2019m in love with this book. It is special, very special. Unique. I see that said about so many books, and sometimes the comments are hyperbole and sometimes they are accurate. I\u2019ve truly never seen another book such as this, and I immensely admire it. I am so grateful (yet again) to the Children's Books group as it\u2019s the April selection for the Fiction Book Club there, and so it finally stopped languishing on my to-read shelf and my on-deck shelf and got read. the drawings are truly amazing and p I\u2019m in love with this book. It is special, very special. Unique. I see that said about so many books, and sometimes the comments are hyperbole and sometimes they are accurate. I\u2019ve truly never seen another book such as this, and I immensely admire it. I am so grateful (yet again) to the Children's Books group as it\u2019s the April selection for the Fiction Book Club there, and so it finally stopped languishing on my to-read shelf and my on-deck shelf and got read. the drawings are truly amazing and pleasing to the eye, both as pictures and as a storytelling technique. More than half the book is pictures. Many of the text pages consist of a single paragraph, or two, though there are sometimes a few pages in the row that are full of text. It\u2019s a real page-turner. I didn\u2019t want to put it down for anything. It\u2019s a wonderful book for boys and girls and young adults and adults, ages 6 or 7 and up. It\u2019s a cross between a children\u2019s historical fiction novel and an art exhibition. Any reader who loves movies, art, books, which I do, and magicians and magic, of which I normally have little to no interest, is likely to greatly appreciate this book. The characters are interesting, appealing, and come across very authentically. Overall, it was written well. I did notice one error where the ly was left off a word and I found that disappointing because it otherwise seemed close to flawless. (I\u2019m not the most observant person so there could have been errors I missed.) The only weird thing is even though I got emotionally involved with the characters and the story, given the subject matter of the story and the circumstances of the characters, I\u2019m just a bit surprised I didn\u2019t feel even stronger emotions than I did. But, I loved this book. The story is wonderful; the pictures are amazing. It was a no-brainer for me to give it a full 5 stars, and it very nearly made my favorites shelf, and I might change my mind at some point and add it to that shelf. I\u2019m lending it to a friend (who became very enthusiastic when I told her about it!) rather than returning it immediately to the library. ...more", "Title": "The Invention of Hugo Cabret"},
