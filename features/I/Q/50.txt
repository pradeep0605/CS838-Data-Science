Spreading its bat wings, it measures in at 766 pages (or at least the ARC version does). TWILIGHT this ain\u2019t, and regular vampire fare it isn\u2019t either. It\u2019s a hodgepodge of Bram Stoker, Tom Clancy, Stephen King, and John Steinbeck: one if by vampires, two if by military games, three if by bloodbath, and four if by brotherly melodrama. Overall I liked it. Honest. I don\u2019t read 766 pages during the school year easily. \u201cBig Mo\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cMomentum\u201d to you young folk) carried me through as the Laws of Physics applied. Meaning? Cronin got this off to such a sick start that the action carried me. I couldn\u2019t put it down. The opening plot line was simple: Dr. Strangelove goes to South America to find the cure for death and instead turns it loose. You can always count on your military brass for that sort of screw up, no? You see, they wanted a serum from these batty vampires living deep in the jungles (only why didn\u2019t they migrate and take in... er, over... the world, like they did later in the book?) so they could extract the GOOD part of vampirism (you know, extended life, superhuman strength, and damn near indestructibility) without the bad part (bad skin, bad breath, restricted diet, No Exit signs in the Mortality Room, etc.). The idea was to give the serum to U.S. soldiers and then look out world! That's right, the USA would be able to kick some North Korean slash Al Qaedan slash Taliban butt! You know the drill, though: the best laid plans of bats and uniformed men.... At their underground Telluride, CO, fortress, the Army injects 12 death row inmates and one special little 6-year-old girl (hint: key to the book) and keeps them under lock and key (and 12-foot steel walls and multiple doors and so on) for observation. Only the hanging upside down former prisoners, now \u201cvirals\u201d (that\u2019s the word for them in this tome), are playing with their guards\u2019 minds because they want to come out and play. Can you say \u201ctelepathic disaster\u201d? Uh-huh. All hell breaks loose and the score winds up being Hell 1 and U.S. Army 0. Here\u2019s where the book takes wing. These nasty hobbits come out of nowhere and rip you open like a can of beets. Every couple of dozen victims are just \u201cscratched\u201d on the throat so they can become part of the Viral Army. And soon America as we know it and love it turns into Cormac McCarthy PlayLand. Yep. It\u2019s THE ROAD all over again. Dystopia with teeth. And compelling stuff, too. We go to various outposts where certain humans have figured out certain ways to survive. Lights, chiefly. Because the virals are creatures of the night and don\u2019t like the spotlight. Where the wheels start to wobble is halfway through. Suddenly Cronin plays fast and loose with his own rules. Suddenly a viral attack develops more than two possible results (death and the equivalent of taxes \u2013 being a vampire for life). Suddenly \u201cthe good guys\u201d (i.e. major characters) are given preferential treatment. And he delves more deeply into the social life of our hearty crew of humans, too, including a fraternal rivalry between bros named Theo and Peter. This is the Steinbeck part -- East of Eden, West of Transylvania. Here Cronin gets a little too sentimental for my tastes, too, especially with the single \u201cgood vampire\u201d Amy, who has none of the bad attributes (elongated bicuspids, penchant for Bloody Marys) but all the good ones (extended life, telepathic abilities, the keys to the city and the book, etc.). In the end, the virals become less scary, the bag loses some of its punch, and you're flipping pages just to find out how Cronin ties this mess together. Then, when you get to the promised land, you see that he doesn\u2019t. Then you see on the Internet that this is the just the first of three books. Then you say, \"Oh, no!\" and ask yourself how in hell a book just south of 800 pp. would ever need a sequel when it's too long by far already. Finally, you collect yourself and recall where you are \u2013 the United States of A-Royalties. This, after all, is supposed to be the Summer Blockbuster of 2010! This, after all, is supposed to be money in Cronin's (and Random House's) bank! This is a book already in the cinematic pipelines with Ridley Scott as director. Fasten your seat belts, then. Get home before dark and pay your electric bill, too. This won't be the last you hear of THE PASSAGE. Five stars for the first half, three for the second. I'll rate it down the middle and let you judge this glorious, bloody mess for yourself.

I\u2019m in Wisconsin; she\u2019s in Minneapolis, and I started to make phone calls. The first officer was a huge help. He said he didn\u2019t know what the rules were, but she\u2019d LEFT THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. I said she panicked, she feels terrible, she\u2019s sobbing. He said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether she's crying, laughing, smiling. She LEFT THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. That\u2019s a crime.\u201d My heart was pounding, and I wanted to say, \u201cLook you Neanderthal fuck. She killed a mirror. Could you be human for a moment?\u201d An hour or so later, I finally reached the right people, and the sergeant assured me she was not in trouble, took my name, number and hers, and said she should report it as soon as possible. \u2026Situation handled, I suppose. But I kept thinking of my first thought, and what I almost said, Did anyone see you? Epic fail. I\u2019m drawn to apocalyptic fiction, and one of the reasons why is that characters are often tested, and <+++>The Passage</+++> is no exception. Faced with temptation or in the clutch of terror, characters succeed or fail. While the book has compelling moments, too often Cronin starts to develop a character but never really completes the task. With such a large array of characters, this needs to be done. You want to empathize with the characters, and they need to be distinct enough so that you can keep them all straight. One problem \u2013 and this may sound minor \u2013 but it drove me crazy, was Cronin\u2019s inability to handle dialogue. With the exception of the soldiers, who spoke in an exaggerated military fashion, many of the characters sounded the same. Also, they seemed to have one expletive: flyers, which referred to something horrible in their midst. Accordingly, most of the characters, when excited, would begin a sentence by saying, \u201cFlyers, what will we do?\u201d or \u201cFlyers, did you see anything?\u201d It was absurd. Picture, for example, something horrible in our lives. Sarah Palin, for example, and then picture her being able to survive, as she is, for decades. [image error] Would we all suddenly start using \u201cPalins\u201d as our only expletive, and then placing this word only at the beginning of a sentence? \u201cPalins, hot enough for you?\u201d or \u201cPalins, we should get moving!\u201d No, for starters, though Palin has been on the international scene just shy of two years, we\u2019ve been pretty creative in coming up with variations on her name: ~ Caribou Barbie ~Failin\u2019 Palin ~the Thrilla from Wasilla ~Palin bailin\u2019 ~Bible Spice ~Deranged asshat (\u2026sorry, that\u2019s just me) Imagine the variations we\u2019d conjure up after decades. Just why Cronin thought having most of his characters use this one expletive (flyers) baffled me, but I also started to wince every time someone used it. I wanted to like this book. I\u2019m a sucker for apocalyptic books where science-screws-up-big-time, starting with books as intellectually thoughtful as Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein right down to Richard Preston\u2019s The Hot Zone . And, the book gets off to a good start. The first third of the book is quite good\u2014the plot moves forward, and characters are developed. Then, you reach Part III, which begins with a long military report that sucks out whatever momentum the book had attained. And Cronin does this sort of thing far too often. He\u2019ll get the plot moving and then deaden it by letting a military report or pages and pages of someone\u2019s diary (in italics! I hate fucking italics!) stand in for the plot he should have developed. This is poor writing, poor pacing, and piss-poor editing. For a couple hundred pages, the book crawls. It gets into gear in spurts, which are again deadened with dull reports or italicized diaries. Cronin\u2019s book, which had promise, lacks the rich characterization needed for such a long book, fails to sustain momentum, and has moments \u2013 particularly at the beginning of new sections - of horribly overwritten passages, such as this sentence fairly early in the book, which introduces Chapter Fifteen: \u201dWhen all time ended, and the world had lost its memory, and the man that he was had receded from view like a ship sailing away, rounding the blade of the earth with his old life locked in its hold; when the gyring stars gazed down upon nothing\u2026\u201d This sentence, already painful, continues for another 37 words. Worst book in the world? Not at all. Cronin has talent, which he needs to develop, and\u2014most of all\u2014he needs to learn how to pace a novel, and not cheat by having climactic scenes told in the form of dry reports or diary entries. ...more Oh, <+++>The Passage</+++>.

How could I turn you down? Your promises, though, were only partially fulfilled. While I enjoyed stoning people in the village square with you, your cover was simply too pretty to be true, and your title too vague to really *mean* anything. I still don't know what the passage was, but it was full of vampire-things and massive doses of character backstory that also didn't really *mean* anything... except make you a very, very heavy book. Brick-like, really. I believe next I'll tie a ransom note to you and throw you through a window, just for the giggles. You had such lovely backstory, such vivid characters in your opening quarter, I couldn't put you down. Well, I could, because you are a fatass and my arms grew lethargic and weak after about an hour, but figuratively speaking. I was hooked, and I loved you for it. Vivid characters, shocking scenery, emotion. You had it all, baby. But then things changed. Oh, did they change. You forgot your old ways and introduced me to a whole slew of new characters. Characters that I didn't care about, in a situation that seemed so distant and unreal compared to your sharply defined predecessors that I thought perhaps I was reading a different book. Gone were the late nights of voracious reading. Gone were my massive biceps developed from holding you at a readable height. I slogged through you, sometimes telling friends that you were \"getting better,\" even daring to say \"really good again\" in whispered tones... but you would then disappoint, like a dog who is allergic to grass, and I would yell angrily at perfect strangers that you were a meandering, lame book with stupid characters and unbelievable situations. I finished you, though, because I had devoted a better part of the year reading you, and I had to see it through. Like climbing Everest, I just wanted to *breath* again, but I knew I had to finish you anyway. And see you through I did, to an ending that only set you up for a sequel, likely full of more meaningless backstory and characters painstakingly developed over 100's of pages only to be forgotten or rendered unimportant. I did not spend 3 weeks reading you to get a cliffhanger, damnit. !@#$ you, The Passage. !@#$ you. Goodbye, The Passage. You were a good workout, and my man-arms thank you.

Declare, It, The Terror. and The Passage. in a lot of horror, i'm not exactly eager to slowly lose myself in the world depicted - the experience is often more like a rollercoaster or a fun nightmare. but that last category, those mournful sagas - they are my special favorites. i may not want to live in a novel's world, but if it is a world that is so carefully crafted and then grown, one filled with tragedy and sadness and coming together and coming undone... i find it very easy to get lost in those worlds. it is a great feeling. so on to The Passage. it is an excellent novel, complete with multi-leveled characters, spiritual mysteries, exciting action set pieces, and the trappings of several genres (vampire, post-apocalypse, and in the first third, an on-the-run-from-the-government-style thriller). the writing is solid, well-crafted, and certainly in no rush. particularly outstanding is the depth of characterization present in even minor or elusive characters such as the scientist Lear or the child molestor Grey. the first third of the novel is pretty much perfect, tightly-paced yet generous with motivation and context, and featuring three of the most warmly written and sympathetic characters i've come across in a while: Agent Wolgast & Sister Lacey & Anthony Carter: fallen agent, unearthly nun, misunderstood criminal. the empathy created by the author for these three and the depth of their background stories... i just really was not expecting that and it was wonderful to experience. unlike many other readers, i felt the remaining two-thirds were very strong, moving easily between a wide range of physical and emotional landscapes, from complex world-building to pointed irony to moments of eerie beauty to straight-up horror (particularly in the Haven sequence). although it could be said that characterization was a bit less rich in the last two-thirds, the range of emotions depicted was often on a wider and more dynamic scale - the reader is able to watch characters actually grow and change. i appreciated Cronin's vampires. they certainly run against the current grain! although the threat of their bizarre, bestial presence looms over the entire novel, they remain enjoyably enigmatic and largely in the background. i assume the amount of attention paid to the vampire Babcock and his traumatic past (also very well done) will be paralleled in the sequels by depictions of the remaining vampires. The Passage has been compared to The Stand; personally i think The Passage is superior. my only real issue is the very ending, which could come across as cheaply ironic and unnecessarily brutal if it wasn't clear that this is only book 1 of 3. i assume that this disturbing cliffhanger of an ending will eventually be resolved with the same sensitivity and grace brought to the rest of the novel's various episodic sequences. ...more The hype machine was working.

Jenna Bush is Texas guv (this is a horror story, after all). New Orleans, battered by another monster storm, is now an uninhabitable industrial park. An expedition to a remote corner of South America, sponsored by the US Army, is searching for a promising and dangerous virus. What could possibly go wrong? The Passage is nothing if not very, very derivative. Although there are a few nifty new notions within its 766 pages, (I will not spoil them by telling) there will be little here that is not almost immediately familiar. Government projects gone wrong, post-apocalyptic struggles for survival, battles between good and evil, strong people, weak people, and lots and lots of vampires. That said, I felt that there were almost two complete, independent books within the whole. The first tells of the beginning of the unpleasantness, lasts for 246 pages and is gripping. I hated to put the book down. Even with the been-there-read-that aspect of the book, there was something about the writing of that 246 pages that kept me turning the pages, thirsty for more. As for the remaining 520, not so much. We move forward almost a century and enter the too-familiar landscape of post-apocalyptic survival. Although there were elements here that were interesting, some characters that held promise, I found it a very, very long yawn. I also felt that the author cheated a few times too many in leading us to believe that certain events had taken place when they had not. He even jokes about it in the writing, having one character say out loud what any reader might wonder about how a particular event transpired. If The Passage had kept up the frantic and so-engaging pace of its long opening, it would indeed have been one of THE BOOKS TO READ this summer. Instead of reading The Passage , though, I would look for an alternate route. I gave it two stars instead of one because the beginning was so good. Otherwise, I resented the time it took to read this waaaaaay too long book. ...more This book, by far, was the biggest book I've read to date.

We turn our focus now to growing rumors that the U.S. Army is conducting secret medical experiments on American soil. The bizarre claims seem like something out of a Stephen King novel yet despite repeated denials by the Defense Department the stories continue to grow, and documents posted on WikiLeaks seem to support some of this. Is this just an urban myth gaining popularity thanks to the internet, or is there something to these rumors? Joining me now via satellite from his office is Major John Smith, a spokesman from the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Major, thanks for joining us. Major John Smith: Thanks for having me. Wolf Blitzer: So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of these persistent stories circulating, Major. MJS: *laughs* Yes, they\u2019re keeping my office quite busy. WB: And the Army\u2019s position is that they\u2019re absolutely unfounded? MJS: Of course. Frankly, Wolf, I\u2019m surprised we even have to bother discussing this. It\u2019s obviously the work of internet hoaxsters. WB: But what about the documentation that\u2019s leaked out? MJS: They are clearly forgeries. Have you read this stuff? Secret bases on U.S. soil? Convicted felons recruited and used for guinea pigs for drug trials to extend human life? Vampire-like creatures that have some kind of telepathic connection and cause bad dreams? I think someone just posted an old X-Files script. I find it sad that Americans are wasting time on this nonsense. WB: It does seem outlandish, but let\u2019s talk a few specifics. The documents mention a Project Noah that the USAMRIID is running. And there are line items in the USAMRIID budget for a Project Noah for a significant amount of money. MJS: I can confirm that there is a Project Noah, and while it\u2019s top-secret, I have been authorized to disclose that it involves research into cutting edge medical technologies that could be used to save more lives on the battlefield. That\u2019s all I can say about it. But it\u2019s obvious that these conspiracy theorists just took a real project name and used it for their own purposes. WB: So there never was a research team funded by USAMRIID that was slaughtered in the jungles of Central America while seeking a virus sample that could greatly boost human healing abilities? MJS: Of course not. Unfortunately, we did have a team in that area that was researching a botany project, and they did sustain casualties after accidentally coming across some local drug runners, but that\u2019s all it was. WB: And the USAMRID does not have government agents recruiting death row prisoners to be the subjects of experimental drug trials? MJS: Again, that\u2019s ridiculous. WB: So where have these prisoners gone, Major? MJS: Considering they were death row inmates, I think it\u2019s safe to say they got executed. WB: I assume you\u2019ll also deny the existence of this secret lab, hidden somewhere underground in the Rocky Mountains? MJS: Absolutely. WB: What about reports from Telluride, Colorado, of citizens having the same nightmares and behaving strangely? MJS: Complete nonsense. I\u2019m based in Telluride myself, and I sleep just fine. WB: One last question, Major. A new wave of rumors regarding a small girl in Memphis being abducted by government agents have begun circulating today. Any comment? MJS: The idea that the US Army had anything to do with abducting children is absurd, Wolf. Think about these stories. Does it really seem possible that the U.S. government has a secret base in Colorado where we\u2019re experimenting with a virus on convicts and small children that turns them into some kind of Dracula-type creature with the ability to invade dreams and brainwash people. Seriously, what\u2019s next? I\u2019m sure the people who believe that will tell you that it\u2019s inevitable that some kind of accident will unleash the virus on an unsuspecting public, and that the country will be consumed by a plague of these creatures until civilization is completely destroyed. And then what? Maybe a small handful of survivors will manage to establish a safe zone and a new type of society? Oh, and a couple of generations down the line, like a hundred years from now, a few of these survivors will embark on an odyssey to find the truth in a post-apocalyptic landscape? Does that really seem likely, Wolf? WB: *chuckles* When you put it that way, Major, it does seem pretty far fetched\u2026. (Crashing noises and screams are heard.) WB: Major, what\u2019s happened? Are you alright? MJS: Ugh.. I\u2019m perfectly\u2026Arr\u2026 fine, Wolf. Ow! Just..uh\u2026 just dropped a glass. Arrgh..

A relatively unknown novelists whose previous output consists of just two slim novels - Mary and O'Neil: A Novel in Stories and The Summer Guest - both of which having nothing to do with end of the world, vampires, infections, and an epic on a grand scale. Where did this surprising development came from? I have no idea, but apparently this goose lays eggs of gold. Stephen King sealed the deal, giving the novel a glowing recommendation: \"It has the vividness that only epic works of fantasy and imagination can achieve...read this book and the ordinary world disappears\" (King also blurbed Hannibal as being better than both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs - I can understand much but I genuinely have no idea where he got that idea from). And did you know that the author of this huuuge novel with vampires is a professor of English at Rice Univeristy in Texas? Get it? Rice ? LOL! Although the novel has been compared to The Stand , I see another comparison which would be way more apt; Robert McCammon's Swan Song , another gargantuan post-apocalyptic epic. Unlike The Stand , McCammon's novel has largely failed the test of time. Although one cannot deny the author his efforts and ambition, it remains deeply rooted in the 80's fear of a nuclear war - which is not essentially a bad thing. What is bad is that it's populated by cartoony characters and sugary sentimentality, with little or no ambiguity. Still, there is a certain merit to Swan Song resulting from nostalgia - it's the epitome of the bulky paperback novel which once was what captured our attention and kept us reading late into the night when we were younger and did not mind its flaws, captivated instead by the story which still had time to get old and cliched. Now, the Huge Post-Apocalyptic Epics are a thing of the past - most novels concerned with life after the Big Bad are much slimmer, and adressed to young adults. And here, in 2010, <---A>Justin Cronin</---A> brought it back to life! How could we not get excited? We still remember reading The Stand years ago and hoped for at least a glimpse of that feeling. The trouble is that this is the 21st century - the author would be hard pressed to come up with new ideas instead of relying on all familiar plot devices and developments...and well, he doesn't. The novel opens with a weak first act, consisting mainly of a stereotypical story of a young mother and her troubles; eventually it gets so bad that she has to sell her body, and then she leaves her daughter at a convent. There is also a B-movie like episode of scientists investigating some wild occurences in South America. Then two cops show up on the stage and have to take the girl who was left at the convent and deliver her to the feds - for some unknown reason (probably because she's a messiah character). The author likes backstories - instead of letting these characters act and come to life, he dumps pages after pages of their past on the poor reader's conscience - care damnit! It does not help that all the characters are bland as hell - the child with hidden powers, the good cop/bad cop routine, an innocent prisoner and I swear that there's even a Magical Negro in there and this hasn't been cool since John Coffey. But something finally starts to happen - the promised apocalypse is sloowly starting to boil! Aaaaaaaand that is the moment the novel takes a surprising leap! Around quarter through it the reader is suddenly and unexpectedly catapulted into the future, and introduced to a completely new set of characters who are left in the world AFTER the apocalypse happened. The fireworks went off, and we weren't even there! The post-apocalypic world itself I did not find to be very interesting - anyone even vaguely familiar with the themes the author approaches will find little, if any, surprises in this part of the text. While the first part of the book manages to maintain at least a mild sort of interest in the reader, the rest of the book is meandering and unfocused, never gaining any real momentum. In over a thousand pages periliously little happens, and the narrative feels stretched to the maximum - and to top that any possible violent or sexual content The Passage is consciously toned down by the author, probably to met the PG13 and reach the younger audience. This is reflected in the relative simplicity of the storyline, complete with melodramatic expressions in all the right places (\"Oh, How he loved her\"). And at the end of the novel there's a giant cliffganger, meaning that the whole thing was just a set up for the other two novels - the sequel has just been published. Loose ends will probably be tied in the subsequent installments - but to take a hardly original idea and stretch into a sprawling and overlong novel which barely accomplishes anything on its own makes me not be at all excited about reading them. ...more This book got me to the important realization that zombies are just vampires gone retarded. I haven\u2019t read any of Justin Cronin\u2019s books. I picked this one up solely based on an interview the New York Times did with the author. Of course, the interviewer was asking Cronin if he read Twilight (he hadn\u2019t.) Is Twilight REALLY the be-all, end-all of vampire books? This book runs circles around that teenage sop-fest. A better comparison would be Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula .

Actually, an even better comparison would be to the movie The Village (without the awkward twist) or George Stewart\u2019s Earth Abides . When I first picked up this book, I considered not reading it because it was 766 pages and that seemed way too long. However, I read the first sentence and got sucked in: Before she became the Girl from Nowhere -- the One Who Walked In, the First and Last and Only, who lived a thousand years, she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy. Amy Harper Bellafonte. It took me about a week to get through this book -- I couldn't put it down (except to sleep and work.) Cronin\u2019s writing is exquisite. I felt like I truly knew (and cared about) the characters. I was even sympathetic to the vamps (or virals as they\u2019re called in this book). Let\u2019s face it, his vampires are the creatures in the night you warn your children about, not the ones you want to make out with. I couldn\u2019t get a good sense of what they looked like, but I visualized something that was a little human, a little praying mantis and a little bat. And let me tell you, the thought scared the bejeezus out of me. It was a fascinating read. I love reading these post-apocalyptic books because there\u2019s such a sense of hope. Even when the world is overrun by scary bloodsucking bat-things, pockets of humanity somehow find a way to survive. I need to start stockpiling batteries and canned food! The ending is a little abrupt \u2013 and hopefully what appears to happen doesn\u2019t actually happen. There are two additional books in the series. I think the next one is coming out in two years (ugh). ...more Thank you, GoodReads for this Advance Reader's Edition. So hard to rate. Act I is simply superb - brilliantly written, suspenseful, beautiful, a full 5. Act II is cluttered, (too) many actors moving on and off stage, rarely doing anything of consequence while they are there. Act III is a combination screenplay, set-up for a sequel, exciting in a dystopian, end-of-days sort of way, (with a ray or two of hope). I've had this book and the second of it's series for awhile. They set on my bookshelf and just look pretty. I would have read them one day...and then the third one came up on Netgalley. I have a Netgalley problem and I requested it, thinking that it would push me to read these. Yeah right. Then my buddy Edward Lorn started reading this. He started posting updates.

Because man-kind is sorta stupid. Things NEVER EVER NEVER work out when they start tampering with sciency stuff. This first third of this book was freaking awesome. I loved the whole FBI secret stuff and the lead up. Then the next third of the book happens. I LOATHE how this part of the book worked. Cronin just jarred my little mind into a whole nuther story and I almost threw the book down and did my first dnf of the year. But I'm trying to be good and that Ed Lorn kept posting updates about how it got better and he is a dang old book pusher and I kept reading. DAMN IT! I also did not like another thing about this book. Everyone using \"flyers\" as a cuss word confused the heck out of me. Just cuss or don't. Don't make weird words into them without the reader really understand it...because I thought since the boogers in this book have some super almost flying powers that they were talking about them. Then the last third came in and saved the day. I didn't put the book down once it started. I couldn't, my fingers were glued to it. Now I'm interested enough that I can't wait to read the others. Now for the baddies, these vampirey things don't sparkle. But you don't really hate them. I liked this..something new always gets my interest. Except I totally saw them in my head as this: No question about who I'm spot lighting on this book. Ed's review is here Ed is one of my favorite reviewers. He makes me want to squeeze in books that I never would have picked up otherwise. Plus he cracks me up. ...more A combination of King's The Stand, McCarthy's The Road, and the movie I Am Legend.

Unlike others, I enjoyed the second third the best. I found the society and government established to precariously survive this new and dangerous world was very well constructed, and grew to care about all of these characters. Knowing now that the book is the first in a trilogy, I think Cronin would have been better served ending the first here, with central characters departing on their heroes' journey. The last third just seemed rushed to me. Too many characters resolving too neatly; too many details about the viral plague explained mystically, rather than scientifically. Above all, I found myself very frustrated by the end. I know that some of these answers may be resolved by Book 2, but would love anyone's theory about just this one sentence from page 759: \"Like Peter, what he was. For Amy believed Alicia knew that, too.\" Huh? Was this something I was supposed to understand from all that had come before, or something that has to wait for Book 2? Also, was anyone else bothered by all the typos and misprints in Chapter 19? ...more First things first. I need to mention I won this book in GoodReads Giveaways.

I had trouble suspending my disbelief when I realized the virus already existed in a remote place; it would be more believable if it was artificially created. It kills the lucky majority of infected people; unlucky few who do not die become - for all practical purposes - vampires. They love garlic and do not care much about holy water and crucifixes, but otherwise they behave exactly like their famous great-great-great-grandfather Count Dracula. The humanity is practically wiped out on North American continent; the scattered groups of survivors have no idea what is going on in other places on Earth and some of them are not even aware other such groups exist. One seemingly ordinary day several people in one completely isolated group found what they think a mere glimmer of hope for all survivors. Other circumstances force them to act upon the information they have. Good old-fashion carnage ensures. This part of the book does have a strong Max Max (the original) Vibe. I would like to discuss the book weaknesses first. Once upon a time there lived a German philosopher Immanuel Kant who according to Wikipedia is now considered to be the central figure of the modern philosophy. The first logical question a this point would be, \" What the heck does Kant who lived in eighteenth century have anything to do with the book I am trying to review here?\" With all of his brilliant contributions to philosophy - and I would be the first one to admit they were brilliant - Kant was not exactly get-to-the point kind of guy. In fact some of the passages from his works are outright painful to read. Now fast forward to twenty first century. Justin Cronin wrote this book. I suspect he is a great fan of Kant's style as his pace makes Kant's look like a charging cheetah. Look at the page count of this monster; I am sure one would not be allowed in some weapon-free places while carrying it (the book size makes it qualify as one). What contributes to the size? Author's inability to listen to his editor, first and foremost. You will get to see a background of every single character appearing (the tale is of epic proportions, so there are quite a few of them). The said background is usually presented in flashbacks. The flashbacks themselves often contain other flashbacks, several levels deep. In fact I think Cronin created a brand new type of flashbacks - one ones with changing POVs. The most frustrating part: about half of the characters with flashbacks would be killed two pages after the tale comes back to present day. Why do we need a complete background of this book's equivalent of Redshirts??? Starting all the way from his/her birth. I could not help noticing one huge plot hole. I mean big enough to host a couple of galaxies. The vampires could not be stopped by modern military armed to their teeth. Make no mistakes, modern military has some very neat toys with serious destruction potential at their disposals. Look no further than Russian RPG-29 as an example. This guy can penetrate frontal armor of a modern tank, but vampires could not be killed with it? To add more insult to the injury the dystopian survivors successfully held vampires at bay with just bows and crossbows. Some explanation of the phenomenon would be welcome, but none was given. Now with all my criticism of this book you would think it was bad. Take a look at my rating. This is right, 4 stars. The plot was interesting and intriguing enough when it was not dealing with flashbacks. Exactly the same can be said about some characters. While reading I kept asking myself that one question typical for a really good book, \"What is going to happen next?\" I do not regret reading this one even though the problems with it made for a very frustrating read. In the beginning of my read I though about DNF, but now I am curious enough to give the second installment a chance. ...more Iako sam upoznata s ovom knjigom ve\u0107 dulje vrijeme nisam je planirala \u010ditati sve dok ne domognem svih nastavaka.

I like apocalyptic tales of the end of the world as we know it. I'm interested in the different ways it could come about and how people react when the reality of their situation dawns. I also like the stories that develop from the immediate effects of the bomb or the virus or the collision with another planet that bring current events to an unseemly end. Books such as The Stand and Seveneves cover the initial catastrophe and its immediate aftermath really well, but then they descend in to fantasy and far future science fiction, respectively. This book drops in the same trick as Seveneves in that having engaged your interest in a group of characters and their fates it suddenly abandons them and leaps forward about a hundred years to an imaginary world I found totally unengaging. Moreover, the characters I\u2019d invested so much time and emotion in are, of course, now nowhere to be seen. I know many will disagree with this view, and that's fine with me. I know my limitations. I've never been able to deal with supernatural figures, ghosts, demons or worlds where the science or social rules are far removed from what l\u2019m familiar with. Call it a lack of imagination if you like. My favourite science fiction novel is probably The Road and I think that's because although the events that caused 'the end\u2019 are only referenced briefly and obliquely, the world it leaves behind feels believable. I could relate to it. For all that, I\u2019ll continue to seek out books that deal with this scenario because it\u2019s something that has a huge draw for me.

And if all that isn't enough, \"Passage\" has been hyped to the hyperbolic heavens by just about everyone with a book blog as the summer's big \"It\" blockbuster. Well, wait. Not so fast. The book does get off to a spectacularly great start. But ultimately, it stumbles and staggers under the weight of all the hype and Cronin's inability to sustain the pace and promise of his first 200 brilliant pages. The novel turns on the U.S. Army's botched experiments to breed immortal, indestructible super-soldiers by injecting them with tricked-up serums from a vampiric bat virus discovered deep in the Bolivian jungle, using 12 expendable death-row inmates and an abandoned 9-year-old girl named Amy as the test subjects. Instead, the 12 inmates transmute into vicious, vampirelike creatures who escape and then quickly decimate an entire nation of on-the-run humans with their infectious bites. Before long, just about everyone's dead, infected or controlled telepathically by an exponentially expanding army of vampires, called \"virals\" and \"dracs\" in the book. These aren't your romanticized \"Twilight\"-like vampires, by the way. No, sir. (The message here, I suspect, is that if you're going to play Russian roulette with Bolivian bat serum, don't use convicted murderers in your clinical trials. Just saying.) Although Amy doesn't mutate into a bloodthirsty viral, for reasons we probably won't find out until the second or third book, she can no longer stand sunlight, ages super-slowly, and communicates mostly through paranormal whispers. This is just about where the book fast-forwards nearly a hundred years, to a barricaded outpost in the San Jacinto mountains where a small band of survivors lives under bright night lights powered by dying generators to keep the nocturnal virals away. Most of the colonists have never even seen the night sky or stars. Soon enough, Amy shows up at the colony as the mysterious, ageless girl with viral-like qualities who may hold the genetic key to mankind's survival ---- if her small but brave band of uninfected humans can survive the dangerous journey back to her \"birth\" place in the Army's secret laboratories in a Colorado mountain compound. The first 200 pages of the book are undeniably fantastic, filled with more memorable characters and scenes and tension than most writers wring out in 500 pages. This is seriously good writing ---- the kind of can't-catch-your breath storytelling that propels us forward while demanding that we read every beautiful, perfectly placed word. Then it all starts to crumble, partly because we're introduced to a new cast of characters after the 100-year leap forward who don't carry our interest as much as the ones we've just left behind, and partly because we begin to sense logical lapses in the storytelling. Why, for example, wouldn't the two colonists who discover that the generators are failing convene a big meeting with everyone to brainstorm solutions instead of keeping it to themselves to avoid a panic? (What ---- no one's going to panic when blood-sucking, body-shredding vampires overrun the outpost after the lights go out? Really?) The book has too many ensemble-type characters for readers to become attached to most of them (good thing; lots of them don't last long). And, frankly, they tend to blend together, with indistinguishable personalities and names like Peter and Michael, and are quickly replaced by other generic characters after they're killed or disappear. The bigger problem, though, is that the character we care about most, the ageless girl Amy, communicates only occasionally in frustratingly short, cryptic, paranormal conversations. She's mostly quiet and passive in this first book, when she's even on the page at all. Even the zombielike virals don't leap out of the shadows often enough in a book where they're center stage. It's a curious choice to take the story's two most interesting elements ---- Amy and the virals ---- and banish them to the sidelines for long stretches, or worse, to turn them into one-dimensional, secondary characters.

I guess The Passage is considered to be an epic, because it clocks in at close to 800 pages. But by the time I finished reading, I felt this was an epic fail of massive proportions, and unless another book comes along this year, The Passage will be my most disappointing and worst read book. The hype is not always correct, even when a well-known respected author supports a book in such a way you must have it as soon as you can. The Passage begins in the not so distant future, around the year 2014. The first paragraph is somewhat poetic and confusing, where you have to read it a few times to digest it; much like the majority of this book: \"Before she became the Girl from Nowhere- the One Who Walked In, the first and Last and Only, who lives a thousand years- she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy.\" Amy's mother, Jeanette, gave birth to Amy when she was only nineteen, impregnated by a married traveling salesman. Jeanette ends up becoming a prostitute, and one night her latest John won't take no for an answer, and she kills him. Jeanette has no choice but to give up her six-year-old daughter and leaves Amy at a covenant with only her backpack full of clean clothing and her beloved stuffed Peter Rabbit. The nun who takes in Amy is a young black woman, Sister Lacey, who believes God sent Amy to her for a reason. Lacey has been having disturbing dreams. But this is nothing new since Lacey has been a little girl, she has always known, understood, because THE VOICE speaks to her. Lacey knows Amy will bring forth a new way of life on Earth. How does she know this? Because it's stated without any real reason given. Around the same time Amy is abandoned by her mother and thought of the second coming of who knows what by Sister Lacey, Special Agent Brad Wolgast and his partner have criss-crossed all over the Unites States to pick up a select group of inmates to be experimented on by the government. This has come about because Harvard professor, <---C>Jonas</---C> Lear, has gone into the wilds of the Bolivian jungle along with a group of scientist and grad students on behalf of the USMRIID (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases). Less than a month in, Lear has grave news. Through emails with one of his Harvard associates, he tells about an attack by bloodthirsty bats, causing death and sickness in his group. He and the victims are eventually rescued by the US military. Wolgast figures out pretty quickly why twelve special inmates have been chosen. They are being infected purposely with the bat virus founded by Lear. But when Wolgast's boss orders him to pick up Amy for testing, that is when Wolgast knows something more sinister is at play. For some reason Amy is the key to this all. Again, no reason is given and should only be taken at face value. Wolgast will put his life in danger to save Amy. But by then it's too late. Wolgast and Amy are able to escape, but those twelve inmates have transformed into \"virals\", bloodthirsty, hiding in trees, almost zombie like creatures who crave blood. And from some mind hypnosis and hallucinations through dreams, they can control humans and are able to make their escape out into the world. Wolgast and Amy hide in the mountains. From very limited newspaper reports, he reads about the downfall of civilization and how the virals are infecting and multiplying. Amy has changed. She can no longer stand sunlight and doesn't seem to age, but hasn't crossed over as a viral for some reason. Again, no explanation why. There is one last resort by the US government to stop the viral apocalypse. An atomic bomb is dropped. Ninety-two years after the virals have reeked havoc on the Unites States, (there's no knowledge of how the other European countries have faired because all communication has stopped) the remaining humans, who were mainly children rounded up by the US military, have carved a life out for themselves. These closed off communities in the mid central United States have found a way to carry on. The virals only come out at night and attack, so the humans armed with their bow and arrows, and protective high protective fences, keep these creatures at bay. There is a select colony mentioned in the San Jacinto Mountains near California to show this perfectly. But lately everyone is on edge. Their source of electricity is running out and the virals are evolving. And then a young girl comes out of nowhere who some have dreamt of. She is Amy, the ageless, and the only one who can destroy the virals. The people of the First Colony must travel back to where it all began and bring Amy to the one who calls for her. The first section of The Passage will grab hold and not let up. Cronin sets into motion a tension filled tale that you assume will have you shaking in fear. Unfortunately, due to very long winded paragraphs and so much information being handed out, without any explanation, The Passage is more of a mind numbing vision quest with heavy, almost in your face religious and spiritual mentions. I was so bogged down with so much telling and not enough showing. The majority of the time I was very confused. Cronin doesn't give any plausible reasons, and we are just supposed to take it as fact and move on. Most of the characters appear, where we are privy to their backgrounds, much like a biography, and then they disappear, only to re-appear again and bring nothing more to the story. This happens way too often. I couldn't connect with anyone, not even Amy. I felt very much like an outsider as I read. The virals, that should be scary boogieman type creatures, were glazed over in such a way that when they barely come out from the shadows they are hiding in to cause shock and horror were incredibly tame and dull if anything. The overuse of the two words, \"I am\" became beyond tedious. Talk about a mantra that will give you a headache. Perhaps the title should have been I Am instead of The Passage? Amy can hear the virals' thoughts, as I am John, Dick, Harry\u2026 I am the former Walrus, goo goo ga joob. I wasn't gripped, amazed or enthralled in any way. I felt like I was reading one of those literary journals I used for research back in college. 300 pages could have been eliminated easily to make it a much tighter read. In essence, the idea of a new spin on a vampire apocalypse sounds perfect, but the way Cronin wrote it, he has missed the mark big time. The Passage will no doubt become a best seller and will prove that a very lacking book can become an overnight sensation based on amazing hype, the support of much respected industry types, and an expensive marketing and promotion plan from the publisher. ...more Marie's review 9/11/12 on Amazon is spot on! If you don't count audiobooks, this is one of the the longest books I have ever read. At first I thought that The Fountainhead was longer, but it only seemed that way because Ayn Rand is kind of a terrible writer and there aren't any parts where Dominique Francon is beset upon by a swarm of vampires (unfortunately). Justin Cronin is not a terrible writer, in fact he's most often a very good writer, and this book has lots and lots of scenes with vampires. Lots and lots because it is so very long If you don't count audiobooks, this is one of the the longest books I have ever read. At first I thought that The Fountainhead was longer, but it only seemed that way because Ayn Rand is kind of a terrible writer and there aren't any parts where Dominique Francon is beset upon by a swarm of vampires (unfortunately). Justin Cronin is not a terrible writer, in fact he's most often a very good writer, and this book has lots and lots of scenes with vampires. Lots and lots because it is so very long and it is just the first book in a trilogy , of course, because everything these days is a Series which is why I hardly ever read any YA fiction, because everyone wants to be the next J.K. Rowling. Except Cronin actually wants to be the next, I don't know, Stephen King, if this book is anything to go by. It won't remind you a lot of The Stand just because both are post-apocalyptic thrillers that detail at length the efforts of the last survivors of a worldwide plague on a quest to save humanity, but because both writers prefer a curious blend of horror and soap opera, tense action and slightly clumsy spirituality (aside on the length issue: I confess I haven't actually read The Stand, which is probably just about as long as Book One of The Passage Whatever-ilogy, but I saw the mini-series and have read enough of Wikipedia and The Dark Tower to get the gist). Oh but where I was going with this point was Cronin is a better writer than King, at least when it comes to tension and characters and dialogue and detail, certainly far less exasperatingly crude (Stevie always relishes his sick sense of humor a little too much. If this was a Stephen King book, when the people transformed into vampires, he'd spend a paragraph talking about how their intestines would let loose and splatter the ground with shit, and then someone would make a fart joke). But this book: it is mostly pretty awesome, and it held my interest all the way through. The first section is the most fascinating, a slow burn build to the release of the plague upon humanity, slowly developing characters in a manner reminiscent of linked short stories. Ultimately this level of attention to ultimately disposable characters (spoiler alert: not everyone is going to survive your apocalypse, even when it happens on page 256) is probably unnecessary, but it's so well done you'll just keep reading. The big leap for readers, and for the narrative, takes us 100 years into the future, and suddenly we're into some heavy world building as we examine the last vestiges of society that have managed to endure. Here the book does slow down considerably, lingering for about 200 pages in this last outpost of humanity, and again, it would probably be a little boring if it didn't do such a good job of making most everyone so interesting. Which is a relief, since they could just as easily have been cardboard cutouts in a book more concerned with plot; certainly they're archetypes, but Cronin is more interested in using the apocalypse to explore human nature than to, uh, revel in vampire nature. When the story really kicks in is page 477, which is kind of astounding, and a lot happens in those last 300 pages, enough action that you really appreciate all the character development that came before, because it makes the suspense sequences that much more intense, and you really don't want anyone to die. But some of them will, though nearly not enough, because there are a few too many GOTCHA!s, when you are sure everyone is safe and then someone dies! Oh but wait, they are somehow fine a few pages later. But then someone really does die! So you're kept on your toes but really, you get the sense that no one you really care about is going anywhere, at least until the climax of the next book (i.e. The Dumbledore Gambit). If you've seen a lot of genre movies you'll probably anticipate some of this stuff, though I admit I usually didn't catch on until after the fact, and then I'd just shake my head; yes, he went there, but he managed to fool me into following him, and that takes some skill. I should probably have avoided calling this a vampire book (the book is indifferent, preferring more often: smokes, virals, even dracs, wink wink) because they aren't, and it takes quite a while but when you finally realize what Cronin is doing with his take on the mythos, it opens up a lot of possibilities for the next two books. I'll be reading them. Sigh. ...more I'm not what you'd call an early adapter, or a trend setter, or a tastemaker.

While the rest of the world is in thrall, I cannot summon any interest whatsoever. I'll leave it to you to decide whether this puts me hopelessly out of touch or makes me an exemplar of good taste. Lately, I have been willfully ignoring the Vampire Craze. I've never seen an episode of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer ; I turn off HBO whenever True Blood is on (which is always); and I've never read a word of Nancy Meyer's Twilight series or watched an insant of Robert Pattinson's catatonic style of acting. Frankly, I want nothing to do with Twilight . On the long list of things that don't interest me are (1) vampires, (2) teenagers, and (3) abstinence. Twilight manages to embody all three. (However, I think that Kristen Stewart's casting is dead on; her pale flesh and blank affect are perfect for portraying the undead...oh wait, she's not undead?). However, I do like two things that Justin Cronin's The Passage represents: (1) post-apocalyptic fiction and (2) sprawling, ambitious epics. So I picked it up. (Carefully, lifting with my legs, since it's a big book). Being a shrewed financial calculation on the part of its author, a graduate of the Iowa Writer's Workshop, The Passage is about vampires. On this basis alone, I assume, comes the fact that it was optioned by Ridley Scott before publication. These are not ordinary vampires, though. They do not wear fancy suits with capes; they do not speak in funny accents; and they do not help you learn to count. Instead, they are a hybrid of every zombie movie of the last ten years. These are blood suckers, yes, but they act more like the fast-moving, high-leaping undead of 28 Days Later , the Dawn of the Dead remake, and I Am Legend . The first section of the book (the best section, in fact), around 300 pages in length, tells how these vampires were created. This part of the story takes place in the near future, around 2018, in a believably realized world where much has gone to hell: gas is $13 a gallon; New Orleans is gone, the victim of a Category 5 hurricane; we're in an all-out war with the Middle East (there is an allusion to an Iranian-funded massacre at the Mall of America); and the US is latticed by federal checkpoints (by the end of this book, I sensed that Justin Cronin is on his way to being the next Ayn Rand). The US Army, looking for the next generation of super-soldier, starts concocting a virus to make an immortal soldier who is hard to kill, heals quickly, and can fight forever. The Government decides to test this virus on 12 death row convicts and one little girl named Amy. It's a trial and error process. The 12 convicts are turned into uncontrollable vampires who can jump high, run fast, see in the dark, and gather followers with a quick bite to the neck (they kill 9 out of ten, with the tenth turned into a vampire or, as Cronin calls them, a \"viral\" or a \"smoke\"). They are nearly impossible to kill, unless you get them in the heart; if you do, they will drop faster than one of Ghana's soccer players. Not to give too much away, but these 12 escape and wreak havoc. (After all, this isn't Twilight ). Most of this havoc is wreaked off-page, and you only learn about it in a series of newspaper excerpts that bridge the first and second half of the book. Suddenly, and quite abruptly, we're introduced to a whole new set of characters, and an entirely different world, many years in the future. This new setting is the Colony, a group of survivors living behind high walls and beneath bright lights. Cronin spends a good bit of time detailing their lives: the tenuous connections with the past; the new lexicon; the struggle to find food and to keep the lights on; and the complext interrelationships of a closed, vaguely incestuous society. (Essentially, Cronin describes the Colony as a Socialist hell, which harkens back to my earlier comment regarding Ayn Rand). Eventually, some members of the Colony leave and embark on a journey, or a passage, if you will. I'll leave further plot discoveries to you, the reader. I came into this book half-expecting one thing, and getting something totally different. As I said before, Cronin is an IWW grad, and the writer of a couple of small, literary novels. In terms of scope and subject-matter, The Passage isn't like anything he's done before. Yet I assumed he'd take a Cormac McCarthy-like tact to what is essentially genre material. That is, I thought Cronin would bring a literary pedigree to the end of the world, as McCarthy did in The Road . I was wrong. The biggest surprise in The Passage is how poorly it's written. We can start with the dialogue, embarrasing at its worst and uniformly unbearable throughout. The most profound and effective things the characters say to each other are exclamations: \"Go!\" \"Run!\" \"Watch out!\" Unfortunately, the characters have a lot more on their minds, which they will speak, at length. The most annoying dialogue trait is the use of the exclamatory phrase \"Flyers!\" You see, even though the folks of the Colony are but a generation removed from a pre-vampire United States, and even though they still have the old f-word (and the rest of the English language), they prefer to say things like: \"Flyers, what was that!\" or \"Flyers, that was close!\" It's so stupid I thought I'd wandered into a parody. Really, that's what the post-apocalyptic future-fighters say? \"Flyers?\" It's something that George Jetson would say to Elroy. Another frequently occuring annoyance is Cronin's overuse of the Proper Noun. It starts on the very first page, with the very first sentence, in which Amy, the immortal hero, is referred to as the \"One Who Walked In\" and the \"First and Last and Only\". This trait is even more pronounced once we are introduced to the Colony. They use proper nouns for everything: their buildings (the Sanctuary, the Lighthouse); their jobs (the Watch) and their history (the First Night, the Dark Night, the Night of Blades and Stars). Again, it nears the territory of parody, like something out of Goldman's The Princess Bride (Cliffs of Insanity, anyone?). This proper noun profusion is taken to illogical extremes. For instance, the people of the Colony call their children \"the Littles\". Why don't you just call them children? I mean, you still have the English language. You still have the f-word. Did that one word somehow get lost? Did you lose it in the dark, on the Dark Night? I also despised the nicknames the characters gave each other. Hightop? Circuit? Are you serious? Is this the It Book of summer, or is it a late-80's cartoon about mutant turtles that are also teenagers and ninjas? And don't get me started with the action scenes. Just horrible. At their best, they're unintelligible and confusing, with no temporal or geographical clarity. At their worst, they read like script directions from a Michael Bay film (in one unfortunate scene, a character drives a Hummer alongside a speeding train, and then leaps from said Hummer onto said train). Cronin also has a bad habit of telling you what happened - for instance, that a certain person died - before explaining how that event unfolded. This technique can be effective at times, but it is much over-used here, and tends to sap what little tension has been built. Does this seem nit-picky? Well, I only noticed these things because of the book's biggest, most glaring problem: it's characters. This is where my surprise is greatest. I thought that Cronin, a literary novelist, would bang out some deep, complex people to inhabit the dread land he's imagined. I was wrong. Instead, you get one paper-thin cliche after another. Every person in the book comes from somewhere else, and by somewhere else, I mean other books and movies. They're all derivative and flimsy and predictable. There's Amy, the Mystical Child (there I go, now, with the proper nouns), and Brad, the FBI Agent with a Haunted Past (it involves a dead child, naturally), and Alicia, the tough female fighter who might as well be called Lara Croft, and Auntie, the Mystical Black Woman who speaks in riddles, and Michael, the Computer Geek, and Peter, the Emerging Hero With Daddy Issues. The advantage of a cliche, at least, is that the person is recognizable. Unfortunately, many of the characters are so vague - just a name - that you tend to get them confused. Even near the end of the book I was struggling to remember the difference between Mausami and Sara. I didn't care about a single person in nearly 800 pages. That meant there was absolutely no tension, no stakes, no peril; I read on only out of curiosity to see what happens. The book reaches it's lowest point when characters attempt to express love for each other. In a novel, I can accept a lot of things on faith, but not the notion that cardboard cutouts can fall in love. There were times when none of this mattered. There were times when the story was so propulsive I actually stayed up past my bedtime to read. Hell - I mean, Flyers! - this is an ambitious world, with its own rules, history, and mythology. That's where the three stars comes in. I mean, despite its pedigree, its size, The Passage can be enjoyed as a summer lark. It also adds some interesting twists on the lives and actions of the vampires, and how they might be defeated. Still, even the good things eventually turned bad, as though the novel had been infected with a virus. Take, for instance, the plotting. Cronin may have failed with characters and dialogue, but he outdid himself with the plot. This is a sprawling work, spanning hundreds of years and two different worlds (the pre-vampire and post-vampire United States). Somehow, though, Cronin ties it all together. Chekhov once wrote that \"If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off.\" This dictum is known as Chekhov's gun. Cronin has taken it to heart. There is almost nothing mentioned in this book - an event, a line of dialogue, a character moment - that doesn't somehow payoff down the road. At first, as these loose ends started tying together, I was fairly impressed. Then I realized that things were a little too perfect, a little too seamless. And then, after a person came back from the dead for the fiftieth time, I threw up my hands in disgust. The twists became so predictable that, when they occurred, I laughed aloud. This may be a dangerous world, but as long as you are a main character, things should turn out all right. (In a final, infuriating jab, Cronin uses the last lines of the book to hint at a massacre that, inevitably, will be dealt with in part two of this proposed trilogy. I'm infuriated because I know that this \"massacre\" will not harm any of the main characters, but I will still get the next book to make sure). I really didn't like this book. I'm realizing that now, as I finish this review. I hesitate to drop the ranking any farther, though, because this is a summer read. It's an escape. Right now, there are intractable wars, spewing oil wells, rampant unemployment, a moribund economy, and the ever-present sounds of Ke$ha on the radio. You can open up The Passage and forget those things for awhile, and be immersed in a place that is somehow worse (though blessedly Ke$ha free). I guess that's worth something. ...more Having just re-read The Passage, via audiobook, (in preparation for reading the third book which was released back in May), I am sticking with my original rating and opinion of the story.

Seriously, it feels like I've been listening to this book for months now and I'm just thankful that it's over. That said, I am still looking forward to reading City of Mirrors. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. ...more The Passage is being pushed as THE summer read of this year.

Are readers ok with not having hunky vampires? Will people be willing to read about vampires that aren't dangerous in a bad boy kind of way, but rather in the they are going to rip you into little fucking pieces without giving you a second to even know they are there kind of way? Anyway, the book itself. It's pretty fucking awesome. It's not the greatest piece of literature but the writing is good. Readers of contemporary genre fiction may find the writing to be a little unsettling because it doesn't trip all over itself in clumsiness, but I'm sure you'll get over that small problem. Readers of normal beach/summer/airplane reads that have been published lately may also find the long chapters to be strangely off-putting, but the story is plot driven so the story as opposed to the idiotically short length of chapters will keep one turning pages. My asshole-ish comments aside, this book is really a lot of fun. The obvious comparison is between this and Stephen King's The Stand , but with vampire like creatures and an amped up amount of social commentary on the current state of our country (but this can be easily ignored). The pacing of the book is a little strange, the amount of development in the first couple of hundred pages is really solid, but as the story expands its scope at times parts of the story begins to feel rushed, while other parts seem to be given a bit too much detail for their importance in the story. This book pretty much took over five days of my life, with reading this as my only activity I did outside of work. Wake up, read, goto work, come home read more of it and goto bed, and try to remember to get in a David poem in the middle of all that reading. It isn't perfect, it's for better or worse part of a trilogy(?, I'm assuming Ariel knows what she's talking about), and the book ends with a whole slew of cliff-hangers in Lost fashion. I hate having to be the kind of person who eagerly awaits the next volume of a series to be published, but it looks like I'm going to have to be that type of person if I want have my questions answered..... sigh. ...more Even thought I am not a fan of vampire books in general, I am going to give a strong recommendation to THE PASSAGE by Justin Cronin.

This is Mr. Cronin's first long work of fiction, and I think he has found a home. Two more in this series are promised, and I will be first in line to read them. He has done things with time sequence and characterization which are unexpected and compelling. I don't want to say any more because you won't like it if I give anything away. But there is much to discuss, and I think you will be doing so with others who read the book. Ever wonder what it would be like if the entire world was populated by vampires and only a few Humans remained to stand against them? Neither did I, but I do now. Give this book a read. You won't regret it. ...more OK, long book, long review. That's the deal. If you write a book that is over 750 pages long, then you sure as heck better deliver a whoppingly satisfying ending.

The premise is not unfamiliar: secret military experiment goes awry, super virus spreads everywhere, most people die, the rest have to pick up the pieces. The fun part is that, unlike many stories born of this premise, the dust never settles, so no true rebuilding can begin. The original threat is still very real, even 100 years after the disaster. Society is one that lives in constant fear and vigilance. It's extrememly easy to die. (This is a really nice contrast with Stephen King's The Stand , in which the survivors just power up the electric plant and resume normal lives with blenders and hot showers and walks in the park on summer evenings.) The result is a very nicely thought-out new form of society and government. It is minimalistic, designed to care for only the community's most basic needs: survival, survival, and survival. No relaxing in the park for these folks! Priorities: defense (keep watch, fight off vampire attacks), electricity (keep the lights on to keep the vampires out), health (recover from vampire attacks, cope with the effects of radiation from nukes detonated a century ago), etc. No question, Cronin is a master at creating tension. Unfortunately, he doesn't understand that it's necessary to let the tension ebb and flow in order to avoid giving the reader a stress disorder. With the tension being maintained consistently at such a high level, there were times when I actually begged out loud for the story to let up a bit, because I couldn't take it anymore. The book is broken into several sections, and Cronin actually ended one of them by having a character think \"Something is about to happen.\" That trick for falsely extending tension is amateurish and maddening. My favorite part of the novel was the setting. Cronin paints such a vivid, beautiful portrait of a devastated world. I can not tell you how much I enjoyed the descriptions of century-old malls, libraries, casinos, harbors, homesteads, etc., all suffering the effects of the historic and ongoing catastrophe. I think it was Orson Scott Card who said that in science fiction, you can ask the reader to accept one fantastical element, but not two. Cronin breaks this rule. OK, I can totally accept that the vampire virus imparts certain mental powers, like hive telepathy. What I can not accept is that *before* the virus, the nun had a supernatural psychic ability, and Amy had a weird psychic connection to the animals in the zoo. After 750+ pages, I still do not see the original purpose for giving them these powers *before* the virus. It was either REALLY bad editing, or just stupid on Cronin's part. Either way, it bugged me the whole time. Characterization is not Cronin's strong suit. Everyone in the story is a stock character. Most of them talk exactly the same. They have each been given one or two stock characteristics to identify them. None of them are particularly likeable. I can't remember most of their names without looking them up. They're just not unique. Here are three examples: - Peter: (the main protagonist): \"the conflicted, reluctant hero\" Mr. Joe Average, with \"misses his unappreciated hero daddy\" issues. Also has brother issues, including a formulaic and predictable \"revelation\" about something his mother said to him on her death bed. Stereotypically, he keeps wondering why everyone is looking to him for leadership. Has a shot at a nice girl but doesn't have the cojones because he stupidly thinks he wants a different girl. Punishes himself by adopting a lonely quest to save the world. - Alicia: \"the uber tough girl\" The attractive redhead tomboy who is totally asexual because she is dedicated to being the baddest-ass fighter girl ever. She has no other distinguishing characteristics. - Amy: \"the creepy immortal girl with all the answers\" A continuation of the solidly established literary/film/comic book/video game trope of a cute little girl who is dead or immortal, has the wisdom of years and some superhuman/supernatural abilities, and contains all the answers. She is a perfect carbon copy made from this stock character mold. OK, on to the ending, and all the reasons why it sucked: - Two characters from the pre-apacolypse times are reintroduced, one as a sort of deus ex machina, the other for unnecessary poignancy. Both were thought to have died hundreds of pages earlier, a hundred years ago, in the initial aftermath of the disaster. Both had already played their parts and had their storylines neatly tied up, with no further attention needed. Their re-introduction tells me that either a) Cronin had written himself into a corner and didn't know how to end things, or b) he is not a good enough writer to have woven them throughout the story so that their reintroduction did not seem so unnatural and forced. - The central antagonist (who I actually thought was pretty cool) is dispatched quickly and easily by the aformention deus ex machina character, who had previously had nothing to do with him at all. It was VERY unsatisfying to have the villain defeated by someone other than our intrepid heros, who had struggled against him for so long. It was also very unsatisfying to have him defeated so easily. And annoyingly, the defeat of the antagonist was upstaged by other events happening to our heros at the same moments, so that we didn't even get to focus on it or enjoy it properly. Boooooo. - Our heros had no purpose for this entire novel. They had decided to get a specific person to a specific place, but they had no idea why. So getting there was underwhelming. - Only at the very end of the novel do we learn what the titular \"passage\" is. Clearly, it is exactly what the next two books in the trilogy will be centrally focused on. That makes this entire 2 pound book feel like a prologue, and consequently a big rip-off and waste of my time. Also, to me it was an example of Cronin's weak writing skills, because he basically hid the \"punchline\" from the reader for 750 pages. If he had revealed much earlier what the big passage was and what it meant, then the ending would have had enormous emotional weight, and been extremely satisfying to the audience. This book is more than the sum of its parts. Despite all my criticisms, I'm actually interested in reading the next book when it comes out. The writing has many, many flaws, but the overall story being told is a really good one. So go read this, or listen to the audiobook. It's worth it. ...more In this masterfully written tale, Justin Cronin takes us on a dark and harrowing journey to witness the death of one age and the birth of another.

After a few days of finding myself called back to the book, as if by telepathic inducement, I completed this amazingly satisfying read. The writing itself is clearly five-star work -- like a smooth and tasty liquid made of words. But the one thing keeping me from a five star, overall, is what seems to be a great gap in the story's center. The build-up to the much-talked-about 'Night of Stars and Blades' that never really happened as part of the story -- and is only mentioned in retrospect. But despite this one disappointment, the entire tale is a wonderful and captivating work of imaginative excellence -- one certainly worthy of the adulation and fanfare it has received. I, for one, will be very interested to see Justin's further writing in this series. ...more It had never occurred to her that God would cry, but of course that was wrong.

However, The Passage is so much more than a vampire book. It is a book that focuses more on courage, relationships, heartbreak, survival and hope. It isn't a small book by any means, having approximately 800 pages but it is a book that I enjoyed so much those pages just flew by, leaving me wanting more because Cronin can WRITE. It takes a great author to introduce you to a character who may only be present for a few chapters in the book, but remains with you. We live, we die. Somewhere along the way, if we're lucky, we may find someone to help lighten the load. I don't want to reveal too much about this book as part of what makes this book amazing is the slow unfolding of events. This is my second time reading through, so that should tell you how much I enjoyed it. It is quite an undertaking, but I feel like it is completely worth it.

This line from the Guardian is the essence for my selection of this book to read (that the Kindle e-book was priced at $1.99 for a limited period also helped). So! Sci-fi Vampire Apocalypse! Well, why not? It makes a change from zombies. The Passage has an odd start with the story of a homeless woman leaving her six-year-old daughter at convent with nuns. There is a lot of melodrama concerning the poor woman\u2019s hard life, abusive husband, extreme poverty, prostitution and accidental murder. In a \u201cmainstream\u201d book this would be fine as a form of character study, but in a book about goddam vampires, I feel it could have been condensed because this woman leaves the narrative early in the book, never to return. This initial section of the narrative, about this woman, goes on for 30 pages without a quotation mark to be seen. This was quite alarming for me, I am a fan of quotation marks; none of this arty fartsy dialogue without quotation marks for me. From page 31 onward the narrative style is more conventional with plenty quotation marks to keep me happy. Anyway, the aforementioned woman has a daughter called Amy is abandoned in a convent in the care of some nuns, but soon she is snatched by shady government agents for a genetic experiment which requires a child of her age who is without family ties. Previously the same experiment was performed on twelve men (of low moral fibre), by injecting them with an exotic Bolivian bat-carried virus. The original plan was to develop super immunity to all diseases; unfortunately, it turns the men into vampirish monsters instead (but hey, the immunity thing works gangbusters). These creatures are called \"virals\", and soon the Agency decides to work on weaponizing them instead. A Viral by Du1l As for Amy, her immature immune system reacts better to the virus and she is turned into a non-vampire immortal with some kind of ESP instead. At the end of the \u201cpresent day\u201d section of the book the virals break out and civilization soon falls. The narrative then jumps 92 years to focus on a colony of survivors in California (so bid farewell to the characters you have invested in). The setup of the colony reminds me of the anime Attack on Titan where a colony is walled off from the outside to keep out Mexicans monsters with a military team to protect the citizens. At this point in The Passage the reader is introduced to a number of central characters, some of whom are the book\u2019s new protagonists. Soon Amy joins them and a small band leaves on a quest to find the Army or some way of dealing with the virals on a permanent basis. At almost 900 (paperback) pages long I feel that this novel is overwritten, quite a few superfluous scenes could have been excised and a much tighter 500 pages book would have been awesome. Of course, against that, you have to consider that it is a blockbusting bestseller which is being adapted into a TV series for 20th Century Fox Television . I do, however, admire the author\u2019s thoughtful narrative construction, world building, and plotting. The characterization side of it is not too shabby but none of the characters are particularly memorable except Amy, and only because of her unusual abilities. For some reason the virals are called by various names: the jumps, the smokes, flyers, dracs, and (mainly) virals, the word vampire is only used a few time in the book. This reminds me of the TV series The Walking Dead where the zombies are called various names except zombies. Still, not calling them vampires make them more sci-fi I think. The world building starts in earnest from page 290, only the first third of the book is set in the present day. At the beginning of the post-apocalypse part of the book, I feel Cronin introduces too many new characters and I only got the sense of who they are after a small number of them leave their colony on their quest to save the world. Having said that, the plotline is easy to follow and the book as a whole makes for a rousing adventure. At this point, I am not sure whether I will read the two remaining books of the trilogy, The Twelve and The City of Mirrors ; as of now, I feel it is rather unlikely. In fact, \u201cThe City of Mirrors\u201d sounds more interesting than the \u201cThe Twelve\u201d and I wonder if I can skip the middle one! As for The Passage , it is mostly entertaining, if unnecessarily overlong. If you like your vampires, savage, unsexy, uncute, and unromantic this could do very well*. I did not find any of it scary, though. To answer the Guardian's question at the beginning of this review: No, but it is a good read. Notes: * Better than the Guillermo del Toro\u2019s similarly themed The Strain I think. \u2022 The origin of this book is quite charming. Justine Cronin was running in a park with his 9-year-old daughter and they decided to make up a story together: \u201cOkay, I said, let\u2019s start. What should the book be about? She thought a moment and then declared: \u201cA girl who saves the world.\u201d \u2022 From what I read on Reddit a lot of people enjoyed the \"present day\" first third of the book but gave up after the narrative jumps 92 years. If you like the characters from the early part of the book you will miss them later. So I feel I ought to warn you in advance. Personally, I like it, it is an interesting narrative structure. \u2022 After posting this review I started reading reviews by my GR friends. I was a little surprised to see the Stephen King comparisons. Stylistically I don\u2019t think Cronin writes the same way, his characters are less vivid and King has a better sense of humour. King\u2019s own vampire novel Salem\u2019s Lot is far more engrossing for me. \u2022 I don't know why GR marked this book as \"read 2 times\", the book is OK but once was enough, thank you!
