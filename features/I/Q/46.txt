(view spoiler) [Who hasn't seen this creepy book, lurking proudly in the \"New Releases\" section? It practically SCREAMS Halloween--a nice, delightful scare that makes you lock your doors tighter, leave on the nightlight, and snuggle deeply under your covers. Only...<---F>it doesn't</---F>. Sure, the girl looks REALLY creepy on the cover and many of the back images are enough to give you the eebie jeebies, but NOTHING that remotely scary EVER occurs within these pages. Okay, maybe the very first scene, where Jacob sees the Thing for the first time, can count. But I am not the most stalwart of persons. I turn away at blood and gore in movies, my stomach churns when I read about gobbets of flesh, and I was scared of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow guy until about two years ago. So when I say that I had no troubles reading this at 11:30 at night and then going to sleep peacefully, you know this isn't that scary. And that is only one of the many failures of this potentially awesome book. This book promises to do something rarely seen in fiction: combine pictures with a story. But there it fails yet again. The pictures are awkwardly inserted into the story, usually surrounded by text along the lines of: \"And X showed Y a picture of a girl PICTURE HERE\". Not what I would call the most \"seamless\" of storytelling. And let's talk about characters, or what passes for characters in this book, starting with Jacob. I really need to get this off my back, so please excuse me here: What a selfish, whiny, obnoxious, pretentious, arrogant little @#$%wad! From the first chapter, where he is trying to get his sorry @ss fired, I hated him (oddly enough, in the Prologue, I actually liked him). We have 14 million Americans without jobs--these are men and women with families, who would take ANY job they could get their hands on just to put food on the table--and here this white, upper class, straight male joker misbehaves at work, treating his boss with disrespect, and gets away with it because his uncles own the store. (This doesn't even touch on the millions of non-Americans who are unemployed and destitute, living in squalor, starving, watching their children die, unable to move from their station because brats like Jacob are taking the jobs they could have had.) Other than he doesn't want to be in the \"family business\", why does he act this way? I have no clue. I would think the supposedly \"smart\" Jacob would realize that this behavior isn't the most mature way of handling the situation and would, I dunno, maybe talk with his parents or uncles about the job situation if he didn't like it, but apparently, Jacob is merely smart in the way that most authors make their characters smart, i.e. a sentence saying \"X is smart\". Jacob is hardly relatable; his parents are obscenely wealthy (how convenient), making it easy for Jacob to go to Wales. Jacob is constantly acting like a diva, complaining about all the wealth he has (must be nice), while reveling in what it can get him access to. He drops words like \"Sisyphean\" but never comes across like the type of kid who would do that (such as Anne Shirley). But poor Jacob, he doesn't have any friends! Well, maybe it's because his abrasive, self-righteous, privileged personality chases them away. But poor Jacob, his mommy and daddy don't listen to every word he says and believe him! Well, maybe it's because a traumatic incident happened, and they are dealing with their own grief. Or maybe it's because they are too busy at work, trying to make enough money to send our resident brat to Wales. So what could have been a strong character (like Quentin from John Green's \"Paper Towns\") comes off like a 5 year old who hasn't realized that the world doesn't revolve around him. Other characters are so flat, it's pathetic. The parents are cold and impersonal, all the better for Jacob to \"run away\" to his fantasy friends (which, by the way, I predicted would happen at about the 130 page mark). Every one of the \"peculiar children\" has only one note to play and has no background, nothing to make them remarkable beyond the one ability that Riggs has given them that may or may not have anything to do with the picture (such as the girl with the mouth in the back of her head--what was up with that???). They are introduced sloppily, awkwardly tying into their picture. And thinking about these \"children\": isn't it odd that they look and act like children? Shouldn't we see something more along the lines of Kirsten Dunst's character in the movie, \"Interview with a Vampire\"--an adult stuck in a child's body? In fact, why are these \"children\" able to experience the passage of time at all, but the town around them recreates the same day over and over again? If it was explained in the book, I didn't catch it. About the only one that does stand out is Emma, because she is Designated Love InterestTM. Which is disgusting, as 70 years ago, she was canoodling Jacob's grandfather. God, why does every young adult novel nowadays require a romance? I was really hoping with this book that we wouldn't have a romance, and based on the write-up, I assumed it would avoid this all-too-common YA trope. But no, we have to have a romantic couple in here, because we have to do something to draw in the preteen and teen Twilight crowd. I mean, it's not like there are girls out there who like Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, and stuff for more than just the sexy times. I guess if A) Jacob had been likeable, B) Emma had been likeable and not been his grandfather's age, and C) the romance had been well-done and not rushed I would have liked it, but alas, it was D) none of the above. And what is it with all these guys being attracted to ice cold women pointing knives into their bellies? Do I need to read more Freud or something? So for story... *bursts into gales of laughter* Oh, sorry about that. *wipes tears from eyes* Yeah, story. Well, the beginning was pretty interesting, with Jacob discovering his grandfather's past. But after finding Miss Peregrine's Home, it just disappears into Sexy Times with Teenaged Looking 80-Year Olds until the author realized he could include another plot and extend the book another 100 pages. And then, as if this book didn't p!ss me off enough, the book ends on basically a cliffhanger prepping for a sequel. A SEQUEL! This book didn't deserve a full novel, much less a SEQUEL! And let me get yet another pet peeve out of the way: World War II is the focal point of this book? Really? Jacob is 16; his grandfather was a teenager in WWII? Sure, it's possible, but come on! It's also just as likely that Jacob, 16 in 2011 (assuming that the book is set during that time because there is zero indication otherwise) could have had a grandfather born in the 40's and 50's. I mean, I'm in my 30's and my grandparents were mostly born in the 20's and 30's - one grandfather had to lie about his age to join the Navy and my grandmothers were way too young. But let's ignore this red herring (Thank you, Captain Obvious, for pointing out the math) and get to the real meat: what is our obsession with WWII? If something bad happens, drag in the Nazis? When you need a quick, easy, lazy villain, let's pull up the epitome of evil in the 20th century without a spec of in-depth study or nuance? Nazis don't have to have any character, motivation or background - nope, all Nazis are EVUL EVUL BAD BAD people, so they make PERFECT villains for lazy writers. I dare an author, particularly a young adult author, to make a character a veteran or survivor of a different war - say, Vietnam. Or maybe Bosnia or Iraq. Wait, they don't want to write about the highly controversial Vietnam War? Gulf War? No to Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghan and Iraq too? I wonder why? Oh, yes, because the moment we say that Jacob's grandfather is a survivor of Vietnam, we have to address the fact that America barged in on a war in the name of defeating communism more than helping out the people living there. For any war besides WWII, we have to address the elephant in the room: how there really AREN'T any \"bad guys\" and how *GASP* the US MAY actually look like evil overlords! And we canNOT have any Young Adult book DARE trample on the GREAT US of A!!! I am guessing the ONLY REASON this book is doing well is John Green's bold endorsement on the back: \"A tense, moving, and wondrously strange first novel. The photographs and text work together brilliantly to create an unforgettable story.\" Besides the fact that for the first 50 horrible pages, in which the book tries and fails to be the next John Green novel, this book is about as far from \"tense, moving, and wondrously strange\" as it could get. As for the \"photographs and text work[ing] together\", no way, not at all. The sad thing is, the Prologue was absolutely amazing. It DID have that creepy portent that the cover promised. It DID have an interesting character--the grandfather and Jacob (who hadn't jumped head first off the Likeable Cliff yet). But all that was wasted in what seemed to be a lack of plot, a horrible protagonist (whom I wanted to smack some sense into) and trying too hard to be quirky and funny like a contemporary John Green novel. Very disappointing and not recommended. I will NOT be checking out any sequels in this series. ** Why did I say 60's/70's? Sure, maybe a grandparent born in 1960 could have had a 16 year old grandchild in 2011, but that would mean that the grandparent had a child when he was 18 and his child had the grandchild at 17--not exactly likely in the 70's/90's!! UPDATE: Four years after reading this book and writing this review, I've had way too many comments questioning my character in regards to this stupid book. So instead of answering every comment, I'll be deleting and banning a lot of people. You're welcome. I've spent this section plus many pages of comments on this review explaining the various points of my opinion, so I would recommend reading them before pointing out something I missed. Some people have commented that's way too much time - I also think any time spent watching football (either American or otherwise) is too much, but I certainly don't tell my aunt, a big 49ers fan, that. The world is full of diverse people, with diverse opinions. I have never gone onto a positive review to argue the other person's intelligence or mental capacity in liking this stupid book, and I don't understand why it's OK to argue with my negative opinion, to come onto my review on a book and insult me. This is not two people sharing a different opinion. This is insulting a person over her own opinions she vocalized on a site dedicated to reader reviews. It is bullying, and I don't have to put up with it. A review is my opinion; an opinion can neither be right or wrong. This is my space. I am allowed to say what I want here, as long as it doesn't violate Goodreads code. You have your own space. If you want to talk about how awesome Miss Peregrine is, instead of wasting time here not changing my mind (and in fact causing me to hate this book even more than I used to dislike it), why don't you take to your space and say what you want? And if you are really worried about people reading, why don't you let potential readers look at the evidence of various reviews and choose for themselves? I prefer someone to think critically and decide whether one person's flaws are another person's flaws than to force my opinions on someone.

You might expect Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children to be a mysterious, deranged, quirky, horror-filled tale, but it just isn't. The novel was clearly written around a collection of peculiar and unsettling photos, but the narrative never reaches the level of creepy of the visual materials it relies on. Instead, it is a mediocre at best book that should have had 10-year old as its characters instead of teens. And instead of artsy, angst-filled photographs, it should have had more appropriate pencil illustrations to go with its Monster-is-going-to EAT-you! BOO! plot. You don't believe me it's bad? Try reading the book or, better yet, listen to the audio version of it without the visual aid of the photos. See what you think of the writing then.

The premise: Jacob grew up on his grandfather\u2019s stories about his own childhood during World War II. Supposedly his grandfather escaped the Holocaust by taking refuge on a Welsh island, at an orphanage that catered to children with strange powers. The grandfather even has photos to prove it. As Jacob grows up, he loses faith in his grandfather, and assumes the stories were fantasies, the photos faked. But when a horrible, inexplicable tragedy occurs, Jacob has to reevaluate. Could those stories have been real? Could this island refuge still exist so many years later? And is it possible his grandfather\u2019s paranoia about \u2018monsters\u2019 wasn\u2019t just paranoia? Even without the photos, this would be a gripping story, but the photos add an irresistible element of mystery. The first-person narration is authentic, funny, and poignant.

This story, for me, feels completely disjointed and messy. It is evidently framed around this marvelous collection of creepy, vintage photographs, but the story is not smoothly incorporated. It reads like you can imagine the author viewing each image and trying to find a way to fit it into the plot of the book. Here's a weird image of a girl smoking a pipe and peeling potatoes, how can I make that part of the story? Here's a creepy picture of some twins in clown outfits, how do I add that to the book? And if you're thinking of reading this as a creepy book for Halloween - it is not scary at all . The narrative never delivers an atmosphere deserving of the photography. It's all a bit bland and never becomes anything more than a standard paranormal tale about teens/children with special powers. Additionally, the narrator - Jacob - is simply not a character I like to read about. I hate it when rich, privileged narrators constantly wallow in their own self-pity for no good reason. Here, he says: If I never went home, what exactly would I be missing? I pictured my cold cavernous house, my friendless town full of bad memories, the utterly unremarkable life that had been mapped out for me. What??? He is from a ridiculously wealthy family and has two loving parents and lives in a huge house. He did have a part time job, but he took it for granted and spent his time showing up late and deliberately shelving things wrong because he wanted to be fired. He also did have a best friend, but his friend not surprisingly walked out after this exchange: \u201cWhat are you, my mom?\u201d \u201cDo I look like I blow truckers for food stamps?\u201d I did not like him at all. Some unlikable characters are unlikable in a complex and interesting way, but Jacob is just a spoiled, entitled and selfish brat. Add that to the simplistic, yet messy, storytelling and this book was completely disappointing. I'm also tempted to say it \"reads like a middle grade\" book, but that would be an insult to some of the fantastic middle grade books I've read recently. It just reads like a not very good book.

The main problem with this book is that the entire time I was reading I felt like a high school English teacher grading a student's paper, when in fact I am not a teacher or anyone who majored in English or writing. If I am simply a normal reader thinking this, then who the hell was working as the editor?? Did they not bring up these issues? Clearly the several people the author listed in his acknowledgements couldn't have I can't even. The poor execution of a good idea is just so upsetting to me.

If I am simply a normal reader thinking this, then who the hell was working as the editor?? Did they not bring up these issues? Clearly the several people the author listed in his acknowledgements couldn't have been reading closely enough. The text was just screaming \"amateur writer, please help.\" What surprises me is that the author's background is in film. Being that I myself have a background in film, I can tell you that the one thing that is stressed is making conclusive ideas. Do not bring up something that has no relevance to the rest of the story (because obviously in film, every second is costly, whereas of course in Microsoft Word there is so consequence to typing more characters.) What bothered me most was that the author seemed unaware about how to properly use the gimmick of his entire book: the old photographs, some photoshopped, some vintage original, to illustrate the world. He used several of these pictures simply to use them, and I find out later that they in fact contribute nothing to the story. That's right. There's no reason at all for them to be there. Often it seems the author was thinking \"oh that's a cool picture, let's throw it in,\" when in fact there's no connection that it's in there, besides the narrator finding the picture. Here I'm speaking of the several pictures of Peculiars that we never meet, the clown twins (who we have TWO different photographs of at different times in the book, as if they have significance), the dog headed boy, the girl in the jar, the girl with the reflection....I could go on. Why include these photographs if they are not involved in your story? You may think they look cool, author, but it weakens your story when you make no mention of them in your story after you show their pictures. At least make up some sort of subplot about how they've been disappearing or leaving, as to why you've brought up characters simply for putting in pictures. The author states at the end of the book there are only ten children, so it's not like they're there and just not talking. So if there are only ten children, then the fact that all these pictures in there of much more than ten children makes it confusing and annoying. The lack of cohesion was just destroying my brain. Another thing that weakened the picture gimmick is that the multiple pictures of Emma were clearly different people and it bothered me that the author pretended that wasn't noticeable. The first picture of Emma was more about age 10/11 looking, and the fact that her age, or a description to indicate she's more mature, isn't stated til two chapters after we see that picture completely derailed me and what the mental picture of her was supposed to be. Then the comparison of the picture of potato peeling Emma with the last picture of Emma were not possibly believable as being the same person. I may sound picky, but if your book is centered around this idea, then make your concept strong! Horace as well, the two pictures we have of Horace aren't possibly the same person, and again, an issue with using about a 9 year old kid for his first picture and then a 17 year old boy's picture for the next. Consistency is important, and if he cared I felt he would have dug deeper into finding better photos for his characters instead of just saying \"oh this might work.\" (And I'm not sure which ones were photoshopped and which ones weren't, but the perspective of Victor's bed in the mirror of that one picture is absolutely impossible, and it bothered me to no end looking at it) Aside from the fact that the entire book felt like it was created simply to show some 'cool vintage photos,' I felt that the author didn't have a full grip on his own ideas. He had good ideas, as complicated as they are. Nice settings, I enjoyed some of the scenes, like the glowfish, and Enoch's big moment, but the writing itself was rather weak. The thing that bothered me quite a lot for the first 2/3 of the book is that the reader is too smart for the book. This book is clearly meant for older teens, due to the language I couldn't say it's for anybody younger, and I know older teens are clearly capable of putting together the information presented and figuring out what's going on. However the narrator does not, and the reader ends up waiting several more pages each time for the narrator to figure it out and then state importantly that he's figured out what's going on as if it's a revelation when we've been waiting for the obvious for a while. Luckily though, at the end there were at least some things I did not see coming, which felt a bit better. However writing-wise I also found some general writing 'don'ts' that screamed out at me, like lack of pronoun clarification, use of cliche phrases (\"face the music\"), and using the same phrase over and over in only a few pages time (\"torn to pieces\"). Additionally, the side story about Marcie (the one with the photo of the girl crouching waiting for the school bus) clearly showed me that the author didn't have a good idea of his own concept. I don't want to spoil the basic premise of how the world works, but if you think about it there's no way she could have been that age waiting for a school bus if you applied the rules of the world to her. And lastly, the way the book ended....is there supposed to be a followup book? I didn't believe so, but it's so unfinished I'm not sure. Perhaps he was going for a bit of both, like 'if this book does well I'll write another, but if not it doesn't matter.' I understand the reasoning of why it ended how it does: because of the way things turned out, the narrator is now in charge and has plenty of things to do with his life. But there's no conclusion whatsoever. The questions that such openness leaves hanging in the air just adds to the already mounting stack of issues with weak writing. Overall, the book had some good ideas, and the gimmick with the photos would have been nice, however the ideas aren't fully formed. With lots of editing and reinforcement of concept, this could have been a good book. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the people working with him on this book didn't bring up or didn't force the author to take a longer look at his numerous weak points, we end up with a book that feels flattened by the author's inability to form and communicate ideas effectively. This book is, sadly, a mess. ...more This is just one of those books whose hype I don't really \"get.\" I read this years ago when it was newly released, and was thoroughly unimpressed .

The book focuses too much on its own little meta-ness that it just lost me. I had grown bored by the middle of the book, and the latter was truly a pain to suffer through. I just don't get it.

I loved the world and the vibe though. \u0647\u0644 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0648\u064a\u0643 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629..\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0647\u064a\u0628\u0629..\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0648\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0628\u0636\u061f \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644\u061f\u061f \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0645\u0643\u0644\u0641\u0627 \u0628\u062d\u0642 \u0645\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u0641\u0643\u0631\u060c \u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627\u061f \u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0639\u062c\u0628\u062a\u0643 \u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0636\u0645 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0626\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0631\u0642\u0629..\u0627\u0648 \u0633\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629\u061f \u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627\u060c\u0623\u0646\u0633 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0642..\u0648\u0623\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0633\u0629 \u0628\u064a\u0631\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0621 Read it before Tim Burton Multi-color edition of it..

After watching the movie thoughts: It's Great, not all multi color...on the contrary, The shifting in the atmosphere and colors of the scenes was AMAZING.. exactly just how I imagine it. Have mixed feelings about the ending though. just as the book though it's still very different. If you're into creepy old photos, specially those with children, you know..when Taking pictures was really too expensive to just take a creepy ones.. And If you're into the theme of Schools for Extraordinary talents youth.. Well, so you're Welcome here... Welcome to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children... Oh and I can't wait to see it with Tim Burton amazing vision. But I feel it's too colorful to the tune of the novel -at least when I saw the trailer and the posters. -------------------------------- \u062c\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628 \u0641\u062a\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0633\u0629 \u0639\u0634\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0647, \u064a\u0634\u0647\u062f \u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639 \u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0627\u062f\u062b \u063a\u0627\u0645\u0636 \u064a\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633 \u0648\u0644\u0623\u0646 \u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0631\u0648\u064a \u0644\u062c\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0623\u063a\u0631\u0628 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0637\u0641\u0644\u0627, \u0641\u064a\u062e\u0627\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u064a\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u062e\u0631\u0641\u0627 \u0643\u062c\u062f\u0647...\u0641\u064a\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0646\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0641\u0631 \u0648\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u064a \u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u062c\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627 \u0643\u064a \u064a\u062a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0634 \u0628\u0647 \u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062c\u0631\u062f \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0627 \u0644\u0627\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u064a\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0641 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0647\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0635\u062f\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u062c\u062f\u0647 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0627...\u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0631, \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0628\u0642\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0633\u064a\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0631\u0642 \u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0627\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0627\u062c\u0623\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0633\u062a\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0641\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u062c\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a \u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0628\u062d\u0648\u0632\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0648\u062c\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u062c\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 60 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0627\u0646 \u063a\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a...\u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0645 \u0636\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0628\u0642\u0630\u0627\u0626\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 A sixteen years old Jacob Portman witness the death of his beloved grandfather..which cause for him nightmares, and delusions..

skip rating the last chapters..which I expected to be stronger.. What may make these last ones okay that it's consider a \"new beginning\" to the next novel...which I hope it'd be even stronger. Two points made me appreciate the novel more : First the Cinematic way of the story telling, and the ease of describing the action made it a good fun read....although I'm not big fan of long action describing but it was easy here.. The Second is the AMAZING photos and the overall design of the book - I notice that the Hardcover edition even more better with the character photo table too- it was really elegant and creepy.. I suspect first that the pictures were made for the novel but it gave me the creep when I know that it was real photos.. Great work been done, that why I appreciate the novel more ,and gave it another 0.5 points to Gryffindor to the rating... I didn't like the ending chapters much... it's not huge encourage to try book two...

When you do sense a bit of that, 1- it never lasts too long and 2- it feels so forced that it ends up being dull. I\u2019m sorry to say this, but <---A>Ransom Riggs</---A> should probably work on his skills for terrifying readers, if that\u2019s what he wants to do to us. But I was a happy girl reading this and being completely unaffected by the peculiar children. Sure, they\u2019re sometimes performing gruesome acts, but very rarely. They\u2019re more like superhumans than terrors meant to crawl into your mind and take possession of your thoughts . I actually felt pity for them. They are sentenced by Miss Peregrine to forever relive the same day \u2013 in a loop of time. Their bodies don\u2019t age, even if psychologically they feel older and more mature. They are eighty-year-olds with the body of children. Yet, they listen to their headmistress and don\u2019t dare disrupt that loop of time created to shelter them from the dangerous outside world, during World War II. But then Jacob comes along, from the future, and entices them with the wonders of the 21st Century. But who is this young man who is able to time-travel and whose grandfather died under mysterious circumstances? Jacob claims that there\u2019s nothing peculiar about him, but what if there is? It all probably looks very intriguing and unlike any young adult book you\u2019ve read before. But it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s sluggish, the mystery doesn\u2019t last for long, the romance is cringe-worthy and there is absolutely no defined plot. Jacob goes from a place to the other \u2013 from A to B and B to A \u2013 and it\u2019s very repetitive. I did like the pictures, which are apparently real ones and barely modified. I thought they illustrated the description of the characters well and gave you something to think about. Aside from that, Jacob is a decent protagonist and his narration amusing enough. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s boring per se, but it\u2019s definitely not what I expected from a bestseller with such a curious premise . I will read the sequel, because the ending takes a new turn that surprised me. Underwhelming, but not unreadable.

That's how reading this book felt, only instead of jumping from disjointed person to person, it jumps from disjointed photograph to photograph. Too bad because it started off fantastic. I loved the writing, the humorous way Riggs has with descriptions, and the old-fashion carny photos were a nice touch. I especially loved the analogy of an orphaned Jewish boy hiding, not from Nazis, but from monsters because he was peculiar. Fantastic. But then Jacob set off in search of these peculiar children and the story became weak explanations of these old, neglected photos. I didn't believe them. With the whole backdrop of WWII, I couldn't help but think about all the lost Jewish artifacts gone to people whom they didn't belong to and who didn't deserve them and I couldn't help make correlations. What about the real story behind these photographs? What would these people and their lost relatives think of the way Riggs used snapshots that were never meant to be public? Maybe if Riggs had told a fantastic story I couldn't help but believe and love I wouldn't have thought about the lost real lives associated with the pictures, but as it is, I didn't think his story justified them. Some of my other issues: sometimes Riggs relies too heavily on the photographs and fails to give adequate verbal pictures. Like with Emma, whose photographs, one too old and one too young, don't look anything like each other. There isn't any written description of her other than she was hot, but with one of the photographs in in shadow and the other her head turned (neither of which were \"hot\"), I couldn't visualize her. I also don't think the loop was explained very well. I didn't quite follow how and when the loop restarted each day and what exactly was happening with the fighter jet fireworks night. I wondered for too long whether time inside the loop affected time outside it and I questioned how one was supposed to jump from loop to loop if loops stuck to a 24-hour period. I could have used more explanation about the wights and hollows too. I think I would have liked the story better without the photographs as excuses for it. Riggs has some talent as a writer and I wouldn't be opposed to reading him again, but if he follows this up with a sequel, I probably won't check it out. ...more A peculiar reading indeed!

However, it was kinda bummer that the story lacks of action, until the very final climax, where even there, you are left in a huge cliffhanger, so not having a real closure in the book was disappointing too. I can understand that this is a trilogy, so we won\u2019t have a definitive closure in the first book, BUT , leaving the book in a cliffhanger, always got you unbalanced. Also, as I commented, the book lacks of action, and while you have it at the final climax of the book, it\u2019s what you can tell as something that intense, that you may expected with such \u201cpeculiar\u201d characters, in both sides of good and evil. However, I still am amazed of the level of imagination, developing character totally \u201cpeculiar\u201d breaking the boundaries of logic or common sense, that I enjoy a lot, since your real life is limited by logic and common sense without any remedy, but if you\u2019re reading fantasy, you want to be mindblowed, and certainly you find some character with \u201cpeculiar\u201d features, so wacky, so astonishing that you have to thank the brain of this author to go beyond. Along with breaking that awful reality of our time that with orbital sat\u00e9lites, there isn\u2019t any place in the world unexplored, so finding again \u201cnew places\u201d to explore, it\u2019s such a wonderful treat. And of course\u2026 \u2026you have the photographs! Peculiar, odd, spooky, you never know what you\u2019ll find in the next photo! \u2026what an unchallenging life it would be if we always got things right in the first go. So, while I expected a higher overall reading experience in this first book\u2026 \u2026the series already proved me that it\u2019s indeed \u201cpeculiar\u201d, different than other book series, and yes, I want to continue the journey. So, we\u2019ll see you in the second book in the very near future! P.S. UPDATE (October, 10th, 2016) I already watched the movie adaptation and I liked it a lot. I think the movie has better rhythm and a climax more satisfactory in the sense of action. Also, besides some changes in characters interactions, the movie was designed to work as a stand-alone story, must likely in the chance that it wouldn't be able to adapt the other two books in the series. ...more Every so often a book comes along that is pure magic, and \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" is one such book.

Part fantasy, part adventure, part eccentric photo collection, this is a story that will enthrall and enchant teens and adults. Jacob is the sixteen year old narrator, and he is intelligent, funny, realistic and perceptive. He is very close to his secretive grandfather, who used to tell him fantastic tales of his youth, and the children's home where he grew up. These tales were often accompanied by odd old photographs, and these same photographs are included in the book, creating a rich visual record that transports the reader on a magical journey. Jacob believed in the possibility of a magical life because of his grandfather and the tales he told. But as Jacob grows older, he stops believing in magic as his grandfather begins to age and show signs of senility. After the shocking murder of his grandfather, Jacob's life is turned upside down. He sees something unbelievable, something that lends credence to his grandfather's stories, and his parents and the police question his mental stability. In an attempt to help Jacob reconcile what is real from the fantastic, his father takes him to Cairnholm Island off the coast of Wales. Once on the island, Jacob feels the impact of being in a place seemingly out of time and separate from the world. The island seems to hide secrets of its own, its fog providing a curtain between the present and past. But hoping the reality of his grandfather's childhood will allow Jacob to heal, his father permits Jacob to explore the island and the old Home. But what Jacob finds forces him to believe in the magical and fantastic once again. Soon events take a darker turn, as Jacob learns he is being hunted by evil beings for shocking reasons. As Jacob says in the story, \"Sometimes you just have to go through a door\", and this would make a great theme for the book. Jacob must make frequent leaps of faith in order to decipher his grandfather's cryptic final words. He must find the inner strength to deny the opinions of his parents, the police, and his psychiatrist and follow his heart and his instincts. Taking these chances is like going through a door, never knowing what is on the other side. But every door he goes through brings him closer to his grandfather's secrets, and these secrets come alive (sometimes literally) as Jacob continues his quest. Enthralling, magical, spooky and wonderful, \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" is one of the most original and captivating books I have read in a very long time.

I knew I had to read it some point in time to finally cross it off the list and when I heard about the Ransom's book signing, I knew it was the perfect timing. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children centers on Jacob, a young boy who ever so loved his grandfather, the man who filled his head with endless mysterious yet wondrous and terrible tales of people with amazing power and monsters too. Growing up though, his faith in his grandfather's stories grew into doubt. As an unfortunate tragedy befalls Jacob, he thinks he's lost his mind- his head full of darkness. He thinks the only way to solve his problems would be to go back to where it all started- to where his grandfather started. He finds himself in a bleak island and stumbles into the broken old house where his grandfather used to live, the place that he will find the truth about himself and everything else. From the very start, I was at ease with the way the book was written and was in love with how the author conveyed words. I never knew that such simple sentences could be so haunting and beautiful. The way Jacob's character was portrayed was really good. Even though I usually have a hard time relating to a boy's point of view, I found it easy to relate with Jacob's. I grew to understand his relationship with his grandfather. I grew to understand his curiosity and restlessness, his peculiarity. I even understood his attraction to Emma. Although I enjoyed reading Jacob (I really did, despite the darkness that I feel lurks inside him), my favorite character would be Millard. How awesome is it that he's invisible? And aside that, I found him totally hilarious!! I really did love all the peculiar children. Each were just so unique, not just with their skills but also their persona. Miss Peregrine's is a really amazing book.The setting, the characters, the plot, the photos were weaved together beautifully to create a wonderful, one-of-a-kind story that surely leaves a great impression upon the reader. I wouldn't consider the ending as a cliff-hanger but it was open ended. It does have a sense of moving forward, making you anticipate the next book. ...more WARNING: This review may contain excessive (and possibly incorrect) use of the Welsh language. Diolch.

I don\u2019t mean to belittle Jacob (the MC) or challenge his intelligence, or any other sixteen year old's intelligence for that matter, but I have never met a sixteen year old boy who would use the word \u201ctorpor\u201d in a sentence. Unless of course it was 'Um... what does 'torpor' mean?!' I\u2019m supposed to be educated (pahaha)and there were some moments where I had to balance an Oxford Dictionary on my knee! There were quite big chunks of descriptive paragraphs that, although beautifully written, I found it difficult to believe that Jake would really say things like that. And speaking of outrageous horror that filled my being with cringe\u2026. The love story? WHAT THE HECK. Just no\u2026 but more on this later. Hero. Besides his flowery language and horrifying taste in women, I liked Jacob. He was adventurous (because even though I would\u2019ve thought it was cool, there is no way on earth I would have gone into that house.

It would probably be a 15 if I included the angst I felt every time the love sauntered on the page, but this isn\u2019t about me. This is about Jake and peculiar children who deal with angst in different and better ways than I. There are a lot of sadness and bitter-sweet \u2018what ifs?\u2019 in this book that made my heart hurt, especially concerning Abe, the sweetest grandpa ever. One of the things I loved most was the subtlety of Riggs\u2019 writing\u2026 the true horrors of the book are only alluded to and allowing you to fill in the blanks. There is definitely a melancholic feel to this book and I felt like I was watching an old movie where you know that there isn\u2019t going to be a happy ending. That may sound like a bad thing\u2026.

Now, Miss Peregrine was an interesting old broad (yes, I'm using old timey slang, deal with it). She can turn into a bird and can manipulate time. Also, was I the only one who saw her as Dame Maggie Smith the whole book? All in all, not a great book but not a bad one either. I've heard the second and third ones are better and since I already plunked down the cash for them, I'm going to go ahead and read them. ...more I did a fun thing last week! I was invited to the Tim Burton handprint ceremony in Hollywood and a screening of the MISS PEREGRINE movie. More photos and event recap on the blog. http://www.themidnightgarden.net/2016... Winona Ryder was there, and it was kind of strange to see her again after seeing STRANGER THINGS so recently, heh. I really enjoyed the film, btw! And now I must acquire a copy of the book to read. It was...fine? I liked the inclusion of old, weird photographs throughout the book, especially the way they were placed - you would read an offhand description of something odd, turn the page, and there was the photo showing exactly that. I liked that part, and the photos were always a pleasant surprise, even though I spent way too much time trying to figure out how they had been faked. But there were just too many stumbling blocks for me to really enjoy this book. The biggest and most obvious is It was...fine?

I liked that part, and the photos were always a pleasant surprise, even though I spent way too much time trying to figure out how they had been faked. But there were just too many stumbling blocks for me to really enjoy this book. The biggest and most obvious issue is the whole concept of \"time loops\", which enable the peculiar children of the novel to remain hidden from the larger world. Time travel as a narrative device is extremely tricky to pull off, because of all the potential plot holes that spring up - it's expert-level, black diamond stuff, and Riggs isn't at the level where he can successfully navigate it. And Jacob, our hero, was a problem. He had almost no discernible personality (probably because he's intended to be a stand-in for the reader, so we can project our own personalities onto him) and had wildly inconsistent characterization. It starts out really well, because in the early chapters, we see Jacob dealing with the fact that he witnessed his grandfather's violent death. Riggs shows us how damaging that can be, and doesn't spare us the details of Jacob's PTSD (one detail I especially loved: for a few months, Jacob can only sleep in a pile of blankets in the laundry room, because it's the only room in his house \"with no windows and also a door that locked from the inside\"). I was really excited that Riggs was doing this, because it's very rare for YA supernatural adventure lit like this to acknowledge that, hey, regular exposure to stuff like this is actually really really traumatizing . But then Jacob's anxiety and PTSD just kind of...go away. Throughout the story, we see him in confined spaces, witnessing violence, and encountering the same kind of terrifying situations that sent him into intensive therapy at the beginning of the book, and he just brushes them off like it's no big deal. It was like Riggs started out thinking he was going to realistically depict the traumatic aftermath of violent, scary situations, but then got bored and decided to just ignore all of Jacob's previously-established mental issues. But honestly, the biggest problem I had was this: I wanted to read this same story, but from another character's perspective and written by another author. Okay, so because Jacob is a minor, his father accompanies him to the island and then just hangs around in the background, quietly having a total mental breakdown that Jacob can't be bothered to notice. Because here's what's so interesting to me: while Jacob has mostly positive memories of his grandfather, the dad remembers him as an emotionally distant father who was never around and may have been having an affair. Then Jacob learns that, no, his grandpa was always traveling because he was busy hunting demons. Fine, but imagine this story from the dad's perspective: an adult man, dealing with the death of his father, learns that he had an entire separate life as a hunter of monsters, and the man has to resume the work his father started while also working through their complicated relationship. Forget the precocious Harry Potter-lite teenage hero; I wanted to read an emotionally complex story of a man reconciling his relationship with his complicated father while also learning to hunt demons. Long story short: this is the first book in a trilogy, but I have no interest in continuing the series. ...more I still have mixed feelings about this book and I can't really make my mind up on the rating so I've decided on 3 stars.The book was sort of all over the place and gives a false image.I naively presumed that the novel would be creepy from it's cover and title but it definitely wasn't.Although,the pictures themselves appear creepy and sinister, the story is not.

The plot itself is quite interesting, especially the time loops and wights but other elements fail the novel.The start is by far the most entertaining especially the opening scene with Grandpa Portman which is slightly creepy and reels you in.I also enjoyed the first few chapters where Jacob is trying to find the peculiar children as there's a lingering mystery about what happened to them or where they are. One of the biggest downfalls for this book was the characters.They lacked so much, like complexity and development and as a result I didn't care for any of them.Also,the relationship between Emma and Jacob was disgustingly weird and I hated it so much. (view spoiler) [Emma was an old woman(at least 80) and had previously romanced Jacob's grandfather but that didn't stop either of them from getting together.Also, all of the characters were pretty old but still acted like children?Like I know they were stuck in children's bodies but still, should they not have matured at least to the level of a 20 year old. (hide spoiler) ] I loved the pictures, despite their irrelevance at times and weak links and I mostly enjoyed the story.However, the characters really needed work and I found the end slightly confusing to comprehend what was going on and it dragged on.I hope the next book is better. ...more Mystery begets mystery as the world of Miss Peregrine and her orphanage for peculiar children takes shadowy shape.

Jacob Porter (I leave out his middle name, which you can enjoy discovering on your own) had been enthralled by his grandfather Abe\u2019s magical, if frightening, tales of his past, horrifying monsters in pursuit and a safe haven of a special school in Wales for those fortunate enough to escape. When being the brunt of derision at school was too much, Jacob cast aside his faith in his grandfather\u2019s stories, and assumed the consensus view that Gramps had been speaking metaphorically, about having been chased out of Poland by the Nazis. But when Jacob is a teen, and his grandfather is brutally murdered, he has cause to reconsider. Ransom Riggs - from The Columbus Dispatch There is something both appealing and frightening about old photographs. In our apartment when I was a kid we had a book with photos from the Civil War. The pages were in less than pristine shape, but there were occasional pages that were well preserved, and on which the images were clear. It seemed impossible that people who had lived almost a hundred years before could seem so real, even in black and white, as if they might step out of the pages into our living room. It was similar in seeing photographs of my parents and their seldom, if ever, seen relations. I only knew my parents as middle-aged or elderly. Photos of them as young seemed, somehow, unreal. Nah, they never looked like that . I often wondered who the imposter was in a photo that was supposed to be my father, in full work gear, in front of a locomotive, sans moustache. Was he really my father, and if he was, who was that guy falling asleep in the recliner in the living room? Emma Bloom from The Peculiar Children Wikia The offbeat collection of fascinating photographs included in Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children is one of the things that makes this book stand out. Author Ransom Riggs has a great fondness for old photos. He had originally intended to use them to make a picture book, but was encouraged to expand on what he had and build a novel out of them. He did, amassing quite the collection, trolling estate and yard sales, broadening his scope and finding unexpected notions and plot direction from the new images he found. He particularly enjoyed spotting photos that were odd. One appears to show a girl floating above the ground, another an invisible person in a suit, another still a young man covered in bees. The book contains about fifty of these curious images. They lend a sense of both antiquity and strangeness. Many are downright creepy. And that is a good, sometimes a wonderful thing, particularly when the images relate to the darker elements in the story. Riggs selected a lineup of these oddities and from them constructed a tale, an explanation for what the photos purport to show. The result is magical, a triumph of imagination, and a rip-roaring read. It was just a casual hobby, nothing serious, but I noticed that among the photos I found, the strangest and most intriguing ones were always of children. I began to wonder who some of these strange-looking children had been\u2014what their stories were\u2014but the photos were old and anonymous and there was no way to know. So I thought: If I can\u2019t know their real stories, I\u2019ll make them up\u2026Sometimes I\u2019d find a new photo that just demanded to be included in the story, and I\u2019d find a way to work it in; other times I\u2019d look for a certain type of photo to fit a story idea. When he begins to dig into the meaning behind a somewhat inscrutable letter his grandfather had left him, Jacob begins on the road to discovery. His quest leads him, accompanied by his amateur ornithologist father, to an island off the coast of Wales. I am not giving anything away by letting you know that on this island he finds a very special place and some very unusual people. Miss Peregrine from The Peculiar Children Wikia I had inconsistent reactions to the book. At first I was smitten. What a great idea! How beautifully realized! It offered the same sort of tingle I had when reading the first Harry Potter. Later, I felt that the story-telling relied on too many tropes. Oddities-thrown-together-to-cope-in-a-hostile-world, for example. It is no stretch to see close links to, say, X-men, or The Harry Potter series, or even, in a more adult realm, the sideshow performers of Geek Love . Then Tthere is the portal to another place. Think the wardrobe of Narnia fame or John Carter finding a magical route to Barsoom. Stargates and wormholes are rampant in sci-fi these days, as are parallel dimension tales, ( The Matrix series pops to mind) and there is always the familiar story of one Dorothy Gale to show the way as well. So, a well-worn path. On the other hand, writers use tropes because they serve a story-telling purpose. What matters more is whether they use well the familiar tools at hand. And they are handled pretty well here. Jacob is a sympathetic lead. Peregrine is a familiar person in charge, the type who is courageous and caring, despite presenting what can seem a severe fa\u00e7ade. The crew of peculiars is perfectly fine. And Riggs has come up with a particularly nifty explanation and form for his other world. What Jacob finds Stepping from one world into another, particularly for teens, is usually about leaving the nest and seeing the real world for the first time, whether this is about sexuality, fairness, conflict, truth, or all of the above. Growing up, coming of age is happening. Jacob\u2019s hormones are stretched a bit here, so we can check that box. Also, he gets to see some of the reality of what his life pre-Peregrine featured. What were the adults with whom he has interacted all his life really like when seen through his newly acquired perspective? Can our character grow sufficiently to take on adult responsibilities, make adult decisions? You betcha. In A Conversation with Ransom Riggs , an extra section at the back of my Peregrine volume, Riggs says One of the themes of Miss Peregrine , and I think of any novel that involves the discovery of a secret world, is awakening\u2014the protagonist\u2019s awakening to an awesome and wonderful and, in some ways, terrible reality he scarcely could have imagined before, but that was right under his nose all along. At the end of Miss Peregrine , Jacob writes that his life was never ordinary, but he \u201chad simply failed to notice how extraordinary it was.\u201d Noticing the extraordinariness of the world is one of Emerson\u2019s major themes. Again, from Nature: \u201cIf the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown. Emerson (Ralph Waldo, not Keith) is referenced several times here. In fact Emerson was much more in the book in earlier versions. Riggs says Emerson often speaks of the possibility of fantastic things that exist just out of view, and many of his most famous quotes almost seem to refer directly to the peculiar children. Riggs offers a mystery, and the clues that Jacob and the reader are challenged to interpret in order to figure out what is going on. And there is magic. The powers of the peculiar children are certainly fun, but not spectacular, overall. A bit of fire control, levitation, super strength, invisibility. A few stand out. One boy has a close relationship with the apian world. Another has a gift for animating the inanimate. A girl can make plants grow very, very fast. One girl has an unexpected way of eating. And of course Peregrine has a few nifty tricks up her wing. The underlying conflict, mirroring the war in the world when the school was founded, (WW II) offers some pretty scary baddies, wights and hollowghasts, the origin story of which called to mind for me Tolkien\u2019s Gollum. The ongoing fear, chase, and battle cycle is fun, generating the needed tension and keeping things moving along. Peculiars - from the film I did not like that dad was portrayed as a dimwit. Not that he needed to be heroic, but he seemed far too lacking in strength and perception for my taste. And then there are the changes made for the film. This review was posted before the film was released, so I can refer only to what I have read, and not to what I have actually seen. I reserve the right to modify once I have seen the movie. I am not thrilled that the film conflates two girls into one. I do understand that changes are typically made when translating a book to the cinematic medium. My objection is a small one. And while I expect to quite enjoy the otherworldly looking and compelling Eva Green as Peregrine, I imagined an older bird in the role. Getting the very peculiar Tim Burton as director is an amazing coup. Whatever changes have been made, I expect the film to be enchanting and wonderfully entertaining. The author writes that this book, like the first Harry Potter, is meant to introduce his characters and his world to readers. It is in the second book in the series, Hollow City , that we can expect to enter that world and experience it more fully. I cannot speak to that one, as I have not yet read it. But I very much want to be kept in the loop for how this series unfolds. Peculiar may not have quite the rich dazzle of the Harry Potter books, but that is a pretty high bar by which to measure any YA series. It is enough that the first one had a particularly fun hook, and was a very enjoyable read, with engaging characters, a good bit of action, some mystery, some surprises and a lot of human, and maybe not-so-human connection. I suppose the only thing that would really be peculiar would be if anyone was not interested in checking this out.

This book ended up being WAY different than I expected. I thought it would be kind of creepy or something based on all of the pictures in it, but the story actually reminded me of some chill version of X-men. There isn't a ton of action and the story did drag towards the middle, but I'm holding off most judgement since it's a trilogy. The author definitely set up a creative scenario here! The strongest part of the story was definitely the writing. Jacob might have been a rather dull narrator, but he still had a distinct voice! I liked the first half of the story better since my favorite part was actually the description of Wales. I kind of lost interest in the second half, but am still interested to see how they adapt this to a movie. ...more Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is an entertaining, different and very well-put-together novel and an all-around great introduction to a new author.

It makes me wonder if the author created his story to fit the photos that he and other collectors had found or if he wrote his story and found the right pictures to fit (or some combination of the two.) Either way it made for a fascinating and fast-paced novel that I found extremely difficult to put down and I eagerly await a sequel so that I can further follow the adventures of these \"Peculiar Children.\" In terms of style, the main character and feel of the book were a bit reminiscent of Joe Hill's recent novel Horns and the style of the book did bring to mind Brian Selznick's The Invention of Hugo Cabret. However the book itself is not in any way a copy of these two works or any other. It is a wonderfully unique story and presentation that brings the characters to life in a way that most other novels do not.

The cover features a super creepy old black and white photo of a levitating little girl, the title printed in a lovely font, and doodles which are reminiscent of tombstone art from Victorian era cemeteries. Inside, this book is just as aesthetically pleasing. The inside cover is a brown and beige design which brings to mind gloomy Victorian wall paper, the actual pages are a thick paper and decorated at the bottom with little brown scrolls. And of course there are the pictures. This novel is filled with wonderfully disturbing and bizarre old black and white photos which complement the narrative. These old photos are all taken from private collections and I applaud Ransom Riggs\u2019s ability to construct a story around so many odd images. Where this book failed is that I don\u2019t believe quite as much attention to detail was involved in the actual telling of this tale as was put into the presenting of it. Yes, this book is visually striking. But after a strong beginning, the story falls a little flat. Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children features sixteen year old Jacob Portman, who is just starting to wonder if there is some truth to the crazy stories his grandpa has told him his entire life. Stories of strange birds, monsters and, of course peculiar children living together in an orphanage on a tiny island off the coast of Wales. My discontent for this story stems from the fact that while it appears to be a young adult book, it is written as more of a book for older children. Or maybe it is because I am a girl used to the angst and the drama, and this mystery is also an action story written by a male author. Either way, this book has a lack of character development, insight, and emotions. The peculiar children here are defined by their oddities, rather than their personalities. Jacob spends a considerable amount of time with children who are considerably younger than him (grade school and middle school age) and the interactions aren\u2019t any different than when he is spending time with adults or other teens. A sweaty, hormonal, impatient sixteen year old boy should have a big brother complex, a power complex, or some reaction to spending time with younger kids, but Jacob does not. Jacob himself should be an interesting kid to read about. He is a bit of a loner, doesn\u2019t have any friends and has (predictably) emotionally absent parents. Yet, we don\u2019t see him struggle with his own oddness or social issues. When adversity strikes, Jacob steps up to the plate just like any other heroic YA hero. Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children isn\u2019t a bad story. Not by any means. It\u2019s a decent story in an eye-catching book and features a new paranormal world that will surely fascinate tons of people. However, all of the attention put to the looks, the plot and the action left the characters to suffer. Plus, there is one major issue with the fantasy aspect that was never explained and that itself bothered me more than anything else.

Say you and I are in the loop, we know about it, but no one else does. That means for twenty four hours we can do whatever, say whatever, go wherever we want and when the loop resets the people we have interacted with start over and forget what has happened. My question is this; if children are caught in the loop do they remain children? Do they grow up? The children Jacob meets are in this loop, so either he is interacting with kids who have never grown. Or he is interacting with very elderly people living in the body of children. But we will never know because, as I said, Riggs has chosen to define the children by their peculiarities. They don\u2019t have actual personalities.

I am however eagerly anticipating Ransom Riggs book of found photographs, Talking Pictures ,which will be released next year.

That's the only thing interesting about the book. The photos, which are ham-fistedly crammed into the plot. Not to step on toes, but I get the feeling that Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is written for a very particular audience. Suburban ten-year-old to tween boys with a taste for \"adventure books.\" Not Harry Potter per say (because Miss Peregrine's has more of a male gaze thing going on), but toeing that line. Plus, Jacob is an altogether unsympathetic narrator. He's ungrateful, whiny, and walks around with a sliver spoon up his ass, then complains about it. Right from the get-go, when he was trying to get himself fired from the family business by acting like a jackass to the ordinary employees, I already knew we wouldn't get along. See, this is why I think it would appeal to suburban or middle-class-or-up kids more. Those in the lowest income brackets would sooner punch his teeth out than empathize with his privileged ass. He complains his parents don't care about him, but doesn't make much of an effort to connect with them in the first place. When danger threatens Miss Peregrine's orphanage, he doesn't take in consideration the Bird's pain or that she might have more important things to tend to, and bombards her with questions for his own satisfaction. There's also a reverse Twilight romance going on, which is weird to say the least. (view spoiler) [Jacob, babe, Emma used to date your grandfather.
