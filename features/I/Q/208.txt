Everybody go and give Julianna a cyber hug right now. GO. So today I was standing around in the kitchen in my underwear frosting cupcakes, and as I stared vacantly out of the window over the sink, I wondered, \"What if I looked up and there was a zombie standing out there?\" I frequently wonder this. Call me crazy, but when I finally peel myself away from my manuscript at about 3:30 in the morning and I let the dog out one last time, I bristle and wonder if, when I open the door, I'll hear that tell-tale ominous moan that marks the dawn of the apocalypse. What weapon would I use? A lamp? A chair leg? That piece of wood that the landlord inexplicably left leaning up against the back door before she was fired from caring for our property? The dog? Either I've been watching too much television, or I'm an idiot.<---F> Those are the only two options</---F>. Well, actually, you could always consider that perhaps my imagination is just inflated; that's neither a bad thing nor good. Alright, being incredibly imaginative does have its perks, especially when you're looking into joining the authorship train, but it also lends itself to crazy shit like this. You know, looking under your bed for ghouls before you get into it. Peering behind the curtains to make sure there isn't a demon waiting there only to jump out and lop your head off when you aren't looking. You lop someone's head off, bitch ain't going to be looking at anything. An imagination of the wild variety is the only thing that could have given birth to something as unique, colorful and adventurous as the Legend series. This is, most likely, one of my favorite series ever. It is absolutely fantastic. And <+++>Prodigy</+++> just blew Legend , its predecessor, right out of the water. It is better than Legend . The characters probably aren't the best display of wild imagination; they're bright, great fun to follow and wonderfully rounded but I can't say they're the freshest tilapia on the chopping block. I'd say what really got me about this book and what really sold it to me was the intricacy and pace of the mind-bending plot. It moves at an absolutely breakneck speed, but somehow, probably through the beauty and skill of Marie's writing, it touches you. The dialogue, romance, deaths and action struck a real chord with me and pulled me in from the beginning. I opened this book and I literally could not stop reading until I was finished. I was forced - nay, compelled to keep turning pages and find out where the plot would move next, which was off the chess board, under the table and into the middle of the road where it caused a huge pile-up and several thousand awesome explosions. Reading this book is like being strapped into fucking Oblivion and forced to complete six rounds of it while someone holds a gun to your head and says, \"If you pee your pants, I will shoot you.\" A quick low-down is that <---C>June</---C> and Day, our heroes, head to Las Vegas where they're welcomed into the fold of the Patriots, who are anti-Republic revolutionaries. They begin hatching a plan to assassinate the new Elector, a young hot one who came into power after the old Elector suddenly died. This plan involves June and Day being pushed around like chess pieces, and along the way they discover secrets about the plan, the Republic and themselves that forces them to question everything they believe is true. There's also lots of making out, sploding, fighter jets, soul-destroying death, kicking and punching, sexy military uniforms, adorable children, jewellery, betrayal, selflessness, selfishness, lover's quarreling and a big, fat love square. The love square was fucking awesome. (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [My GOD, I want June to be with Anden in the next book. The whole thing was left hanging at the end, and as much as I love Day, I just...UGH. Anden. I fucking love that guy. He's absolutely gorgeous. However, I do not want Day and Tess to be together. It's just weird. They don't make a good match at all. (hide spoiler) ] But man - the twists in this book left me reeling. At the beginning I was all cocky, thinking I had it all sorted out, but by halfway through I was on the edge of my seat gnawing my fingernails down to the quick, because the plot veered in so many shocking directions that I just didn't know what was going to happen next. And the ending! The ending completely blindsided me. I didn't know what the hell to make of it. It just happened, this huge bombshell, and I was left reeling. How do you deal with that shit? And I can't even spoil it for you all and tell you what happens until January! This sucks! I said before that the plot surpassed the characters, but that's not to say the cast of this story wasn't a shining beacon of gloriousness. As usual to begin with we had a little problem with June and Day sounding the same but after a while they grew into their habits, and I could separate their voices. Once you know the characters well enough to pick up on their subtle mannerisms, it becomes easy to determine who's inner monologue is who's. There are just so many awesome characters in <+++>Prodigy</+++> . Razor was fascinating, and as usual Kaede's spunk had me snorting into my coffee. June and Day are very solid protagonists, each flawed but entirely lovable. They work as a great team, sparring off one another. They're both capable, intelligent, interesting heroes that I found myself really invested in. Their romance is something I'm still on the fence about, but the emotive element is there and it shows. They have chemistry, enough to make me buy their affection, but I can't say I was blown away by the romantic element. Still, the great thing about this series is that the romance is not a central part of the storyline, and if it were omitted, the series would still be as compelling and fun to follow. The secondary characters made the cast for me. I was absolutely heartbroken about Metias, and the truth about his death. (view spoiler) [Oh, hell to the no! As if Metias's death wasn't tragic enough. We're now hit in the face with the revelation that he was actually in love with Thomas, who then went on to kill him because he was ordered to by Commander Jameson. Okay, so part of me wants to believe that he couldn't have done it and he's lying to protect...someone, and because he never really gave a direct...oh, who the fuck am I kidding. Thomas is deplorable. He knew that Metias was in love with him and he killed him anyway. I know he felt that he had no choice but for fuck's sake, Thomas obviously loved Metias back and what he died was unforgivable. What a piece of shit. (hide spoiler) ] It was awful, painful, brutal. And that's the essence of it; this book is written with so much heart and skill that in a few sentences you can become so invested in a character or backstory that it just pulls you in. I had such a strong emotional reaction to Metias. Even dead, he played a huge part in the rest of the book, and I loved that. I loved that the relationship between he and June remained a part of the story and a part of her motivation. Other characters, such as the hilariously wonderful Pascao and sweet little Tess added lovely gold embellishments to what was already a great story. The only character-based gripe I have is that I'm unsure what Commander Jameson's role was in this book. I felt like she needn't have been there - she really added nothing to the conflict. Just a minor nitpicky thing there. The writing was spectacular, the plotline tight and beautifully paced, the characters colorful and brilliantly crafted. The ending broke my heart, but at this point I'm wondering where the series has left to go. Prodigy has an extremely interesting ending, in that it ties up most if not all loose ends. I'm curious to find out what could possibly happen next, so I'm of course going to wait with baited breath for the third installment, and probably enter into some kind of Hunger Games-esque duel in order to acquire an ARC. I cannot wait two years for the next book. I will die. I will actually die. I mean, I just... The ending. THE ENDING. *There's only two days to go and I can't hold on any longer and I have to say it, but if you look at this fucking spoiler tag before you read the book I will hunt you down and make you sorry.* (view spoiler) [OH MY GOD, when Kaede died I cried a river and then some. How is this? How? How is it even...? Why did...? I don't even...? And then Day has a brain tumor and it's inoperable, and despite knowing for absolutely sure that someone will find a way to save him in the last book, because he's Day and he's a special snowflake, I'm still sitting in a corner jittering in terror. How could you do this to me, <---A>Marie Lu</---A>? Did I hurt you in some way? Are you punishing me personally? Fuck this. Fuck that. Fuck everything! Let me go cry again because the agony is like a crocodile chewing on my soul. (hide spoiler) ] Excuse me while I lie in a snotty, sweaty, sobbing heap on the floor, clutching a frosting can full of my feelings. In short: this book is fucking amazing. When it comes out in January, you had all better get in line behind me to buy a hardback copy. Because I'm going to read this shit again. And again.

Here I am yet again eating my words. A year ago, when I read Legend , I complained about the world building. Mind you, I did think it was a fast-paced, exciting read, but it felt incomplete as a dystopian novel because I couldn't fully visualize how the society fit into the world as a whole.

A year ago, when I read Legend , I complained about the world building. Mind you, I did think it was a fast-paced, exciting read, but it felt incomplete as a dystopian novel because I couldn't fully visualize how the society fit into the world as a whole. By the end, I was left with so many questions about how everything functioned. I felt like Marie Lu was purposefully keeping secrets from me just to string me along to book two. Well, I supposed it did work and to my immense delight, it was well worth the wait. And I loved it. Instantly, I noticed a change from Legend to Prodigy. The biggest being the change in my opinion over the two main characters June and Day. Originally, June and I didn't mesh well, but in Prodigy that situation was flipped. It was Day that was the new thorn in my side for the majority of the book. From the beginning, June warns Day of the Patriots and their leader, Razor, but Day, blinded by his hatred of the Republic for destroying his family, fails to heed her warning. A part of this is due to doubt of June's loyalty being placed in his head from other Patriots and his best friend, Tess, who is not ashamed to show her dislike for June. And just when I thought I had it up to *here* with him, he wised up and took action. The \"old\" Day that warmed my heart in Legend was back. June, on the other hand, I liked very much. I thought her character growth was a vast improvement from Legend because she's clearly learned from past actions. In Prodigy, she is more aware of the corruption in the Republic and is therefore able to pinpoint wary situations. Yet, the thing she struggles with the most in this sequel are her feelings for Day and how their relationship could possibly work out given their backgrounds. Can they remain together even with the knowledge that June's actions in Legend resulted in the murdering of his family? Are they simply too different for it to work being from opposite economic classes? And then there's Anden, the new Elector Primo, whose interest in June was shown in Legend and apparently still holding firm. Wouldn't it just be easier to be with someone like him? That's the predicament June finds herself in. And while it may sound rather angsty the way I've described it, I never felt it was overdone to the point of instant \"headdesk-ation.\" Another improvement was the world building. And with that, I'm now wondering if I'm often too hard on first books in dystopians. I'm noticing a trend with world building becoming more pronounced in the second books in series when I usually prefer some sort of set-up to the story. (Perhaps this is just my high-fantasy mind kicking into gear.) But everything came together nicely here. We found out how the country was split into two separate ones. We find out how the outside world views the Republic. We find out what's going on in the Colonies (though, I would have loved to hear more about them). Sure, I would have loved to know a little of this during Legend, but I have to say, I've enjoyed the ride thus far. Finally, there's the ending, which I will warn other readers, does end in a rather disturbing cliffhanger. *sniff* In my Legend review, I complained about the illusion of Day and June's invincibility. N-n-not so in Prodigy. *hiccup* Okay, okay. I admit it. I was a teensy bit emotional. But only for, like, five seconds (plus an hour or two...maybe...).\u00a0And now I'm secretly cursing myself for ever complaining in the first place. Why? WHY?! WHY?! OH, GOD. WHY, DO AUTHORS KEEP DESTROYING MY FEELINGS?!\u00a0First, I was in a bit of shock. Marie Lu wouldn't do that to me. I mean, she had built up the anticipation perfectly throughout the entire novel. I thought ALL THE THINGS were going to be okie-dokie. *We interrupt your regularly scheduled review for a moment of angst* /end *moment of angst* (Er... Sorry, that was weird.) So then when I finished the book and was LEFT ON THE BLOODY CLIFF, I was like, \"Marie... no.... you, evil genius... no...\" So basically, Marie Lu has me hook, line and sinker. I'm completely enthralled in this series and I can't wait to see what happens next. Big thank you to Anna from Literary Exploration for lending me her ARC!

I've been so pleasantly surprised by my long-awaited January sequels, first Through the Ever Night , then Everbound ... and now Prodigy has come in and turned a series I was on the fence about into one where I anxiously obsess over what will happen in the next installment. Marie Lu really focuses on developing her characters here, whilst still exploring the politics of her dystopian society and introducing one really evil twist to this story. The highlight of this book, for me, was Anden. I am delighted with how Lu handled his character and made her story so much more complex than a simple battle of good vs evil. This novel asks the question: who are the good guys? And you keep changing your mind about the answer. The journey we are taken on here is fast-paced, we see Day and June divided over their loyalties to different people as they team up with the Patriots to carry out an assassination plot on the new Elector Primo. The map gets a little bit bigger too and we start to get a clearer picture of what the rest of the world is up to at this point and just how this society was formed. This is information I was longing for in Legend and was disappointed not to get it, but I am just relieved that this is one of those cases where the author actually knows what she's doing. She knows why and how her dystopian society came into being and doesn't throw around empty words like \"rebellion\" and \"war\" hoping that will be enough to satisfy her readers. I was one of the minority that didn't feel much either way for June and Day in Legend , I liked them enough because they didn't annoy me or anything like that but I thought there was a lack of character development. No such problem here. I feel like this second book tests them as people and challenges their ability to trust each other, the battle is a much more psychological one than in the first book and this allows us to see sides of their characters that we didn't know before. And Lu doesn't stop there. There are so many characters in Prodigy that become more important, more developed. Tess begins to doubt Day's loyalty, Kaede is hilarious and I love her spirit and Anden is just brilliant. And the ending. Oh my god, THE ENDING . I just can't, no, no, no... you can't just do something like that!!! Part of me loves that Marie Lu went there and part of me is freaking out.

But he is in every way just adorable and huggable. Especially in \"the ring\" scene. That was something cutest i have ever read. And we get to find out something interesting about him: he has inferiority complex and he has Stockholm syndrome . Now, let me explain. Inferiority complex comes from his thinking that June is from high class and that he is practically no one, has nothing, he thinks he is not worthy of her and it just f*cks him up more. Scene 01: After he tells June that he loves her, and she answers nothing. \u201cI suddenly feel so stupid for telling her that I love her, as if I\u2019d be able to make her love me in return like some common girl from the streets. She didn\u2019t say it back, anyway. Why do I even care? It shouldn\u2019t hurt this much. Should it? Don\u2019t I have more important stuff to worry about?\" # facepalm Scene 02: Conversation between Tess and Day: \u201c\"What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d At my silence, she puts her hand on my arm. \u201cWell, do you love her?\u201d she says more quietly. \u201cDoes she love you?\u201d Love her? I\u2019d told her so in that Vegas bathroom, and I\u2019d meant it. But she didn\u2019t say it back, yeah? Maybe she never felt the same way\u2014maybe I\u2019m just deluding myself. \u201cI don\u2019t know, okay?\u201d I reply. My words sound angrier than I actually am.\" #extreme head desk No need for more right? And then we have his Stockholm syndrome conversation with Tess, i will leave the quote say the rest: \u201c\u201cDay,\u201d she begins again, \u201chave you ever wondered why you like June so much? I mean\u2014well\u2014given how you were arrested and all\u2014\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She takes a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of this thing somewhere before, on the JumboTrons or something, where they were talking about prisoners from the Colonies. About how kidnapping victims fall for their captors.\u201d I frown. The Tess I know is fading away into a cloud of suspicion and dark thoughts. \u201cYou think I like June because she arrested me? You really think I\u2019m that twisted in the head?\u201d \u201cDay?\u201d Tess says carefully. \u201cJune turned you in.\u201d I throw down Tess\u2019s hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d Tess shakes her head mournfully, her eyes glossy with unshed tears. \u201cShe killed (view spoiler) [ your mother (hide spoiler) ] , Day.\u201d I take a step back from Tess. I feel like I\u2019ve been slapped in the face. \u201c She didn\u2019t do it,\u201d I say. \u201cShe may as well have,\u201d Tess whispers. I can feel my defenses rising up again, closing me off. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that she also helped me escape. She saved me. Look, are you\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve saved you dozens of times. But if I turned you in, and your family died for it, would you forgive me?\u201d I swallow. \u201cTess, I\u2019d forgive you for just about anything.\u201d \u201cEven if I was responsible for (view spoiler) [ your mom\u2019s (hide spoiler) ] death? No, I don\u2019t think you would.\u201d She fixes her eyes on mine. Her voice carries a hint of harshness now, armored with an edge of steel. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. You treat June differently.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about you.\u201d\" And i never saw it that way either. But yeah, June did capture him, and because of her he did suffer. A lot. So i feel pleased that the author actually thought about it. And now, i feel quite anxious to read the third book, because that cliffhanger kicked my ass. I mean, i hope Marie Lu won't do it. Except being through a lot, and finally gets 5 minutes of happiness, she drops hell on him again ??? Dear Miss Marie Lu , i like you, but you are quite sadist. Bigger than i am, that's for sure. June : I don't know how i feel about her. I wanted to throw my mobile phone out of the window because of her, and then again i was still interested in reading her POVs. She hasn't changed at all and still says anything that first comes to mind without actually thinking about consequences. She repeatedly hurt Day that way, and psychological wounds hurt more than physical ones. But, i like the way she thinks: Day pulls me close enough for our noses to touch. \u201cI love you.\u201d My heart flips in excitement at the desire in his voice\u2014but at the same time, the technical part of my brain instantly flares up. Highly improbable, it scoffs. A month ago, he didn\u2019t even know I existed. So I blurt out, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d Day furrows his eyebrows, as if I\u2019d hurt him. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he says against my lips. I\u2019m helpless against the ache in his voice. But still. They\u2019re just the words of a boy in the heat of the moment. I try to force myself to say the same back to him, but the words freeze on my tongue. How can he be so sure of this? I certainly don\u2019t understand all these strange new feelings inside me\u2014am I here because I love him, or because I owe him?\" And i agree with her. How can he say that he loves her only a month after, and how can he say that when she did all of the stuff to him? So i understand why she refused to answer, but still i hate it because as a reader, you know that what Day feels is real . Tess : A childhood friend of Day, the person who grew up with Day on streets, and a person who has grown up in so little time. I liked her always, and many times she was just right. She offered advices, but she lost herself in anger, and made some situations even worse. Other characters : I can't say lot about Anden, but i guess actions speak more than the words. I still hate Commander Jameson, because of everything she did to Day, and i hate Thomas with passion. Especially after finding out what he meant to Metias. We even learn more about Metias, and i just wanted to weep at the injustice of his life and death.

If I just walked by you on some street one sunny morning and thought you were cute, stopped, shook your hand, and said, \"Hi, I'm Daniel.\u201d *** \u201cLove is illogical, love had consequences--I did this to myself, and I should be able to take it.\u201d *** \u201cI make sure to keep a good distance between us, just in case she decides to get happy with a knife or something.\u201d *** Well enough,\u201d I reply. \u201cRemember, you\u2019re drunk. And happy. You\u2019re supposed to be lusting over your escort. Try smiling a little more.\u201d Day plasters a giant artificial smile on his face. As charming as ever. \u201cAw, come on, sweetheart. I thought I was doing a pretty good job. I got my arm around the prettiest escort on this block\u2014how could I not be lusting over you? Don\u2019t I look like I\u2019m lusting? This is me, lusting.\u201d His lashes flutter at me. He looks so ridiculous that I can\u2019t help laughing. Another passerby glances at me. \u201c Much better. *** Paper clip ring scene: \u201cSorry it\u2019s kind of stupid- looking,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cWish I could make something nicer for you.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d I interrupt, trying to fix what I just said. \u201cI really like it.\u201d I run my fingers over the tiny ring, keeping my eyes fixed on it so I don\u2019t have to meet Day\u2019s eyes. Does he assume that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough? Say something, June. Anything. My details come bubbling up. \u201cUnplated galvanized steel wiring. This is good material, you know. Sturdier than the alloy ones, still bendy, and won\u2019t rust. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d I stop when I see Day\u2019s withering stare. \u201cI like it,\u201d I repeat. Idiotic reply, June. Why don\u2019t you punch him in the face while you\u2019re at it. I turn even more flustered when I remember that I have actually pistolwhipped him in the face before.

And after reading Legend, I was glad I didn't have to wait to read the rest of the trilogy. I did wait even though I owned the books, but I think we all have been in that situation where you want to finish a series but another series or standalone book calls your name. And now, here I am a little upset with Prodigy because nothing happened in the beginning, a little in the middle, and everything just broke my heart in the end. I love Marie Lu. I love how she changes her characters and either makes them weak and stubborn to strong, powerful and dark. Or just adds small and enough changes to the other characters because a lot isn't really needed. That's what happened in Prodigy. Few people ever kill for the right reasons. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM LEGEND. Prodigy starts off where Legend left off. June and Day have escaped Los Angeles and are headed to Las Vegas. After escaping, they both know they are the most wanted criminal and traitor of the Republic, so they pretty much know they have to escape somewhere else and not let any of the other soldiers track them down. As Day and June are headed for Las Vegas, they know their only chance of escaping for good and not being tracked down is to join The Patriots, another group that is well known for their \"criminals.\" Even with Day having a broken leg and June not being able to completely let go of the republic that knew her as a prodigy and one of the best soldiers, she can't completely let go of the place she so-called home at times. But a lot of things have happened once they arrive. The Elector dies, and it's up to his son, Anden, to take control and manage a way for the people to love him and be like his father. Or not be like his father. The reason for the joining of The Patriots, Day and June are sure they are the only ones that can help Day save his brother, Eden. And now that they are given orders that were unexpected and not being sure how to complete them, one including killing the new Elector Primo, Day and June must work together with each other and trust The Patriots and see where this all leads to. Maybe there will be vengeance? Maybe people will listen to their innocence? Maybe there will be war and chaos? Love is illogical, love had consequences\u2014I did this to myself, and I should be able to take it. June really is the same June in Legend. She hasn't changed much, and that was something I really liked. She didn't betray anyone, or lie to anyone, and didn't go back to the Republic and either turn herself in or anyone else in. She was loyal to The Patriots just like she was loyal to the Republic and was the same June that still seeks vengeance for her brother and risks her life for the boy that she loves but can't express her feelings. She was still a kickass heroine but was still the same one that cares about the people she loves. She focuses on her missions and sets her mind where it should be. Day hasn't changed either. His leg is broken but after being fixed, he goes off running and is still the same amazing runner Razor heard about him (Razor is the leader from The Patriots.) His relationship with June grows in some scenes but fades in others and it gets complicated, but Day knows he loves the strange girl he met, only ending up betraying him but helping him at the end. He knows he loves her, but he also knows it's a long step to make to tell her he loves her, and he knows there is too much going on between them. Even with that, he agrees to help The Patriots if they help him back and as he and June help each other out, they're able to speak their voices for the people and Day is able to see his little brother Eden again, just what he was hoping. As for the other characters, Tess was a complete bitch and I hated her for changing so damn much. She was so jealous of Day and June's relationship and would try to give him reminders that \"she\" is the reason for his mother's death and brother, John. That he is the reason he got beaten up and suffered in the Republic. That she is still loyal to the murderers of his family and would be able to break his heart any moment. Funny, because (view spoiler) [he ended up breaking her heart instead so I just wanted to see Tess and punch her because there June was, trying to fix her relationship and telling Day it could work out, when Day decided to walk out of her when he gave her his last kiss and said goodbye. Who's the heartbreak now, Tess? (hide spoiler) ] Tess was also ignorant of June's decisions and how much she actually did, when Tess was really nothing and did nothing. I just hated her so much and I was glad she wasn't part of their journey but would always there for Day when he was hurt. Sure he had someone, but if it was someone else like Kaede or Razor himself would be better. Tess would just argue with him and tell him their relationship wouldn't work and that why is it that he fell in love with her in a couple of months and thanks her for saving him, when Tess would help him multiple times and that they've known each other for so long. Okay I got it. I understood they're basically childhood friends and trust each other completely, but even with that, it wasn't really necessary for Tess to get so jealous because Day decided to choose Tess. The saving was completely different. Day was about to get killed, and Tess didn't do anything compared to saving him when he was about to be executed. Her saving were completely different. If I knew or remembered them I would say, but I don't so I can't. Also, it's funny because June saved Tess when Tess was about to \"fight\" Kaede. In Legend , Tess accidentally ended up in a brawl of fighters and when Kaede was about to put it up, June took her spot and decided to fight for her. Damn. Not even with a save from getting a face broken is she thankful. Pathetic. Kaede was cool and a little show off just because she's been with The Patriots for so long and knows a lot more. Her arm is still broken from the time June broke it so that made me happy. Is that bad? Hey she thought she was all tough and shit but she was really nothing compared to June. She's strong, and was always the one going on the trips with Day and showing him \"how it's done.\" They had some funny moments and I was glad there was no love triangle between them, unlike Day, June and Tess. Well, it was Tess's fault. Razor is known as the leader of The Patriots. He was also part of the Republic, but that was just for additional information and giving it to The Patriots. He wasn't loyal to the Republic, but acted like one. He was the one who set up the plans and told June and Day what they had to do. Other than that, there wasn't much to it. He knew was he was doing since he probably the oldest and always knew how to solve a situation. Anden is actually the one who changed. He's nothing like his father and maybe never was, just seemed like it. He was caring and kind to June and I know there are some that ship him with June and want them together, and I admit, I woudn't care. After that ending and seeing Day didn't try much, it wouldn't bother me. But, I don't think it will really happen. He was expected as an arrogant boy ruler but instead, he really wanted to help his people and wanted everyone to rise with him. There was no faith in him and it left me a little upset, but I was glad Day was there to speak his voice and let everyone hear them talk about the truth about this young, boy ruler. Thomas is still an asshole and I hate him. I'm just waiting for something to happen to him in Champion that involves either being killed by June or Day themselves, becoming poor and homeless, or just being executed by someone. I just want him to die and to not continue through the whole novel of Champion. He's still a lying ass and I hate him for everything he has done. He thinks he's cool and shit when he's jus a piece of shit and a weak ass. He can't do anything and I hate him for stealing Ollie from Mettias and June. He used him to track her down and I hate him for it but I was glad he didn't do anything. If he hurt him a slight bit, I would've cried and this would've lost a star just for that. I'm just hoping something bad happens to him. The writing is similar to Legend, June's perspective is black font and Day's is the color of the book, so blue. It was confusing at first and I'm not the biggest fan of colored font, but I was able to keep up and keep the pages turning without repeating line over line because of how confusing the color was at first. Marie didn't add a lot of changes and I was glad, but I was expecting a lot more action and fighting scenes. I was glad she worked on the romance and relationship between Day and June. Like others, the bathroom scene was probably my favorite. The ending was really sad and broke me because I really don't know what I'm expecting in Champion now and see where this all goes. I know romance isn't the main focus of the book, but I actually hope it all works out and I hope they get to be together again and actually work it all out. Like I said, I was expecting more fighting scenes and only got a few. Unlike Legend, everything sped up and got really good towards the middle, around page 250. I was upset because there was no focus other than romance, plans, and communications. Hopefully there's a lot more in Champion and hopefully everything I expect will be there. What I really expect is for Thomas to fight someone. I just want his ass kicked, it's all I'm hoping to see. Everything I am familiar with is gone. I'm really looking forward to Champion but I don't have high expectations. I had a lot for Prodigy, and only a few were met. The only reason I was really looking forward for this was because I saw the book trailer and I literally fell in love. It's so simple and short but it was enough to grab my attention. Hopefully Champion is better and there are most sci-fi elements.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more 3.5 stars - BR with Lian.

Every part of your life is determined by your economic standing; free social service is nonexistent. Freedom based on income. My point: Prodigy was an interesting read for me because it depicts the US falling into ruin, then splitting into two halves, each spiraling down to become one of the options above. The Republic = Option One The Colonies = Option Two There's some food for thought. Perhaps Marie Lu shares my views on the fall of the US. I didn't mention this in my review of Legend because the dystopian world of the series wasn't explained and expanded until Book 2. The worldbuilding I missed in the first book was delivered in Prodigy, which was a relief. I couldn't give Prodigy a full five stars because of LOVE TRIANGLES. UGH. Not one but TWO new love triangles are established in this book and it pisses me off. Not because it was unrealistic; people fall in love in inconvenient ways all the time so that was definitely believable. What I can't stand is when authors turn perfectly kind and lovable people into complete dicks for the sake of resolving a love triangle conflict. Ever read the Shatter Me series? Think about Adam's transformation and you'll know what I mean. So Tess, a lovely girl with great prospects and an admirable PLATONIC relationship with Day, all of a sudden falls for him and turns into a raging asshat. This is not okay! Slow-building character development/deterioration: that's reasonable. Total 180s out of nowhere: NOPE. Stop that shit. Aside from that... Though the plot was a bit slow, the unveiling of the Republic's inner workings and the glimpse at the Colonies made up for it. I enjoyed Prodigy nearly as much, if not just as much, as Legend. ...more Check out my blog for more book reviews and related stuff: Rimsha @Ramblings of a Bookworm so excited !!!

I easily found my way back into this story even after so long; a feat in of itself considering my lack of memory (it's scary how much I forget by the time a sequel releases). Prodigy lives up to its predecessor, maybe even surpassing it with the incredible progress in the world development--which was something I was a tad disappointed by in Legend. We finally discover the reason for the current state of this world; we get to understand a lot more of what it now comprises of, both tangibly and politically. In consequence, the plot itself is a little slower paced than Legend, however I doubt this will lead to many complaints seeing as how much more we learn about the complexities of their affairs. I remember thinking, while reading Legend, that this series was a perfect example of dual POV done right. I still agree with this fact; Day and June are two very different characters, reflected both by their voices and personalities. Switching from one character to the next is painless and never disorienting, nor did I ever lose track of which POV I was currently reading (many dual POVs tend to blend into one another). In this sequel, we observe a lot of character growth in which both Day and June are fighting against deeply rooted indoctrinated beliefs, not knowing who they should trust in this messed up world anymore. This inner turmoil is shown throughout the book, making it it's easy to see and sympathize with their personal struggles. Day and June being separated for a large part of book means there is not a great deal of romance, though in my opinion this was greatly needed for them to be free to find themselves; to figure out where they belong in this broken system. Assassination and conspiracy rule the plot of this sequel. Despite my mention that it's not especially fast paced, there is plenty of commotion that advances the story. Besides character and world building, the plot takes on intriguing twists and turns, some predictable, but others that took me completely by surprise. Seeing more of the world means we finally visit the Colonies that we're all dying to see. It's only a glimpse, however. Just enough to make us crave for more, yearning to see every inch of this mysterious and talked up place. At least I'm sure we'll get to see more of it in the third book, so it wasn't too big a disappointment. A sequel worthy of its name, Prodigy not only continues the story of our beloved Day an June, it strengthens and molds it, proving itself to be an essential part of this series. -- An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.

Unfortunately, it might be one of the most disappointing reads of the year as well, for the following reasons: 1. The beginning bored me to death. The recap was lacking and I felt lost reading the story for a very long time. Also, the first half was unbearably slow. I kept skimming through large chunks of the narration in hopes that the pace would eventually pick up but it took over 50% for the action to really get going. 2.

I kept skimming through large chunks of the narration in hopes that the pace would eventually pick up but it took over 50% for the action to really get going. 2. The dialogue felt unnaturally stiff and the lack of communication between June and Day made me inwardly cringe more times than I can count. Their understanding does get better towards the end, but they had way too many awkward moments during the book for me to devotedly cheer them on. With these two, I'm just not sure if they're better off with or without each other. 3. Day's POV did not feel realistic at all. Truthfully, I haven't read that many young adults with male POVs, but his doesn't sound at like a teenage boy's, even one that's been through as much as he has. He was overly dramatic at times and drastically moody at others. 4. I never thought I'd say this about a Legend novel, but there's more angst in this book than action . And more surprising still, it's Day who was the angsty one. June had her moments too, but they were greatly outnumbered by Day's melodrama. 5. The love square is the most disappointing and irritating part of the book. I was so happy that Legend didn't have one that this almost feels like a betrayal. I'd become deeply invested in Day and June and their romance by the end of Legend , and now I'll be surprised if we can get a half-way decent sequel to Prodigy . I admit that Anden was unexpectedly likable, but the love square is still terrible. That said, I predicted June would come to like Anden (view spoiler) [and give up on the assassination plot (hide spoiler) ] , but there were definitely a lot of unpredictable plot twists in here as well . Not as many as in Legend , but good enough that I didn't go through with the 1-star rating I was initially leaning towards. The ending was certainly shocking and perhaps even heartbreaking for some, but not for me. If I'd actually cared for the characters, I would've felt a lot more anxious and a lot less detached about everything. Sadly, I was just about ready for the book to be over at that point. Am I interested in finding out how this latest crisis resolves itself? Absolutely. Will I be anticipating the sequel half as eagerly as I anticipated Prodigy ? Not even close. It was interesting while it lasted, but overall, a very disappointing sequel . Too much teenage angst and not enough action , which was pretty much the one thing that made Legend stand out amongst all the other formulaic YAs released last year. *Buddy read with Jenny.

The first book was good- cute, nothing amazingly spectacular but enough to make me really take an interest in the characters. This book took the feels to a new level, at least for me. June and Day are on the run, trying to survive and have hopes of finding the patriots and bartering with them to save Eden. Though the story starts off right where it ends in book one, the plot changes drastically with lots of nice little twists and turns. I was on my toes throughout the entire book. This was such an easy read- easy for me to fly through it. Even now, after reading it a second time- I was still racing through yet trying to savor every precious moment June and Day have together. Trust me, though they admit to feelings in the first book- they are far from ever being together. There's none of the 'oh look the main characters are together so its no longer interesting.' Don't be fooled. Your heart will suffer. Day is nothing short of a perfect and precious human being. He's bound at heart by so many factors- guilt over his family, Tess, and this strange connection with June. I love being in his perspective- seeing how he sees the world. Idk.. I just have such a connection to his character. I still love June and yes, even Anden and Tess. But really, Day just steals the show. Not sorry. The world grows a bit in this book but isn't anything super detailed- but I'm kinda glad it isn't overly developed. It is described simply enough that it makes sense and not lacking- but the focus really is meant to be on the characters . Don't expect to be wow'ed by the dystopia factors. **Okay, I've said this once before, but Marie Lu definitely listed these characters as too young. Just make them older in your head... seriously.

I think they are cheap devices in literature and yes that's coming from someone who coined the term \"Dream Travel.\" It's just dream travel is real and what happens in dreams isn't and so it feels like they don't really move the plot along. They just dump info. And one final nitpick, at one point Day is put under for surgery. In most cases people cannot have dreams when they are under anesthesia. That one is a small one, but I had to note it. The second book is really great! Gripping and fun. The ending to me was a little wrong. I get why it happened that way. And yes, I immediately went out and got third book, but it was definitely a crafty device for ending the book. Honestly, I'm torn on what I want to happen to the characters. Very good book, which delivers a lot of exhilarating emotions. Oh and one final note, bathroom scene. Nice one! :) ...more Stayed up late in the night to finish this one.

Love you guys. PROPER REVIEW -maybe. I have to admit, the first one hundred or so pages were slightly disappointing. A little boring, as many others said, but not only: here, the realtionship between June and Day (I was typing Jay and Dune and I am likely to do this mistake again; I apologise in advance) is, to say the least, irritatingly awkward. They seem a bit, just a bit, silly. And then Day came out with that \"I love you\" and I thought we had lost Marie Lu. In my entire life, I have never been so happy to be wrong. I have loved very few fictional couples with the same intensity with which I loved June and Day in this book. What won over my heart was the complete, unbreakable devotion they harbor one for the other, a devotion that it even more valuable because of the very short period of time they've known each other. It is a thoughtless, selfless, groundless faith, and all these 'less' are its strongest 'more' . It is this inconsideration that makes them more willing to risk everything, more brave in the face of all the adversities, more determinate to fight for what they believe in and for the ones they love. The bottom line is, not only is Marie Lu able to bring me to like and truly understand a love triangle (see The Rose Society ), but she's also able to bring me to like and understand a glaring example of insta-love . So these are the options: 1. this woman has superpowers or 2. this woman has superpowers. Am I right or am I right? Also, June's relationship with Metias. We saw him for barely twenty pages in book one and then only through June's memories, but it's as if he is an outright character, surely more vivid than many other whimps that fill ya literature and dare to call themselves alive. And the way June figured out what was going on thank to her dream of him? Wonderfu and moving. one of my favourite moments. Being clear that what I adore of Marie Lu's storytelling is the way she shapes her characters, it won't take you aback to hear I didn't even mind the insufferable Tess. She really behaved like a ninny, childish brat here, but she had all the reasons to do so. She's only, what, thirteen? I am actually surprised she didn't freak out before. And again, I am kind of on her side; Day's blind loyalty toward June couldn't not seem born of a mindless and fleeting puppy love to her. And yes, of course it was horrible of her to turn her back on him like she did, but it was coherent with the development of her character, so I am fine with it. Anden. I am so glad he (view spoiler) [is not the same old ambitious young leader, possibly the son of the former/actual leader, who seems good but at last inevitably turns out to be the bad guy -any resemblance to The Darkest Minds is purely coincidental. (hide spoiler) ] This suffices for me to love him. Going back to the flaws of the first part of the book, another fact I can't help but mention is the fact that way too many things reminded me of The Hunger Games. Really, way too many. The thing of the streak of red hair, for instance, appears a bit inane to me. It sounds like a mention to The Hunger Games (the pin, the braid) rather than a truly original element or something Marie Lu put in the story for some specific intent. Or Day's reputation: it's an impression that stuck to me since book one, but I feel like some more focus on his wrongdoings, crimes or whatever was needed in order to make him a believable inspiration for such a large crowd. I don't know, maybe it's just me. And, last but not least, the ending. I refuse to talk about it. I think I have some ideas about where the story is going with that: (view spoiler) [when the doctor says the tumor (is that it? whatever) is situated near the hippocampus, what do you want me to think? (hide spoiler) ] . I really hope I am wrong though. It would be too painful. Oh, wait. Marie Lu is so sadistic it's scary. Which means that there is no way for me to avoid that.

Also, June was given the task to assassinate the new Elector of the Republic. And Day reunited with his childhood friend, Tess\u2026 And then moaned about his life. Good times. -June was a decent enough heroine. At times her voice came across as cold and distant. I would have liked a little more emotion from her narration. All she seemed to care about was Day, and it was just pathetic. She really needed other things to feel passionate about. On the plus side, I liked how capable, clever and skilled she was. -Day was awful. He was so self pitying and righteous. Ugh, and that huge chip on his shoulder was off putting. It was annoying how he acted like June looked down at people when it was actually him that was stuck up and judgmental. He kept judging everyone who had money and who lived in comfort \u2014 his bitterness and resentment was annoying to read about. -Also, I was irritated with Day's blind support for the colonies. It was ridiculous \u2014 how did he know they weren't as bad as the Republic? What facts did he know about them? Why didn't he research them? Oh and how was it that Day was made out to be such a player at age 15?! I just can't accept a 15 year old as a player. -Day and Tess. Ugh, why couldn't they have just stayed friends? Why did they have to have romantic feelings for each other? They worked much better as pseudo brother and sister. It was bizarre that Day seemed to care more for Tess than June, even though he was meant to be in love with June. It ended up looking like Day was just in lust/obsessed with June rather than in love with her, and I don't think that was how the June/Day romance was meant to be perceived. -The romance was just a mess\u2026 Day claimed to love June yet he wanted and worried about Tess more. Surely, the girl he loved would matter more than a good friend, regardless of how long he'd known each girl?? -I was pissed that Day said that he would save Tess instead of June if he had to choose between them. So yea, he'd let the girl he's supposedly in love with die so he could save his friend. Really? How can he be in love with June when he would rather save another girl over her? Was that meant to be romantic? Even though he'd known Tess for years and June for a few months, it was still idiotic because he was supposed to be in love with June not Tess. -It also irritated me that Day was number one for June, whilst June was at the bottom of the list for Day. Day even admitted to himself that he hated June because she ruined his friendship with Tess. WTF?! June loves Day wholly\u2026 yet Day hates June because she got between him and his other love interest?! WTF?! Ugh. -It's obvious June will be Day's HEA - and I'd prefer it if he didn't want June dead more than his other love interest, it just makes the HEA unrealistic. I'd rather June ended up with someone else. Day doesn't love her as much as he claims. Actually, I'm not sure he loves her at all. -Day being told at the end that he was dying. Really? WTF?! What was the point of that? It's obvious he's going to survive. Why write such a cheap cliffhanger?! -I liked Tess in the first book but in this one she was pathetic. She kept throwing herself at Day when he was clearly infatuated with June. I knew Tess was going to turn into the jealous, bitter love interest that was bitchy to the heroine. I would have liked the author to take Tess's character down a more original route, and had her caring for Day as a brother or a friend. Apparently, all secondary female character have to be petty jealous cows. -Did June have one female person in her life that she cared about? No. It was all about Metias and Day. Ugh. Overall, I wasn't impressed. I liked Legend but this was such a disappointment - Day became insufferable, the plot was dull and the romance was horrible. Hopefully, the next book will be better. ...more This is even better then the first book!

But, in general, it just the same old song about two super young MCs rebelling against their government and beating in every game those who older, wiser and have more experience in this life, which doesn't feel real even in fiction. I feel nothing about the story, characters, events, deaths and so on. Really... I don't even know what exactly makes me reading the series further. Everything what is happening here is kinda far-fetching and seems unrealistic. The only part that is quite good is action. Marie Lu has a way with all these running, flying, jumping, shooting around and stuff. It's all kinda fantastic and has nothing with real life, but entertaining all the same. But when it comes to romance... you have a lot of seeming and true love-triangles, a lot of passion, adult passion, between 15-year-old kids. Does someone expect me to believe that June is so sexy and smart and... or Day is the hottest Republic Rebel? Why don't they act according to their age? And why don't they stop making out while the world is falling apart all around them? In this installment we would get closer to late President's son Anden. He's 20, guys, that makes him my favorite hero just by default. Day and June would join the Patriots, would know more of Colonies and about themselves. We'll meet Kaede, Tess and Thomas again, a bunch of new people and even more people. We'll try too kill new ruler of the country and then we'll know something shocking. To be honest, I wasn't shocked. In the middle of this book I wished it and in the end I got it. This is an old series, I mean, it was written at those times when dystopia was one of the most popular genres and when authors loved to make their books as much dramatic as possible. So hello DRRRAMA, I was waiting for you, you are welcome! If not too be harsh... June is ok, I guess, I like her character and her chapters were more entertaining to read about than Day's. Also she seems more believable, all her skills were cultivating by professionals, while Day is kinda self-trained person. June smarter and isn't fast to judge. And she has a chance to end up with Anden. So I'll finish this series just to be sure that it would happen or to be angry with another final. In general... maybe I'm late to the party and a few years ago I could love Lu's books way more, but right now they feel like a teen-ish fan-fiction, that's it.

I loved all the characters and my feelings for Thomas have definitely changed. There has definitely been character development. June sacrificed so much for the people she cares about. She was able to make the right choices and able to risk her life so many times for a better future. Day. Oh Day. Its wonderful how he started to trust June and open up so much for her. I fell for these characters so hard. In this book I was definitely able to connect with them. Also, I was starting to really dislike Tess. She was starting to become so petty. I felt like her only purpose was to create more drama and stress out Day. The female characters were so kickass. I loved how the females were so strong and great at kicking butts. Kaede is my son. I also loved to learn about the world Marie Lu created. We finally got information about how the Colonies and Republic were formed. It was nice to know about this dystopian world's background and it was frustrating in the first book not to know about the history. The bathroom scene was probably my favorite. ;) I really enjoyed this book and absolutely hated the cliffhanger. Definitely looking forward to Champion ! ...more W O W THE FEELS THO.

Not to mention some sweet moments that might melt you LOVED IT! What an AMAZING story! \u201cHe is beauty, inside and out. He is the silver lining in a world of darkness.

Not to mention some sweet moments that might melt you like ice-cream on a sunny day. Take care of your heart when you\u2019ll read this book, as it is heartbreaking and extremely exciting! THE WORLD In Legend we didn\u2019t get much information about what was really happening in the Republic and we definitely didn\u2019t get any information at all about what was happening outside this tiny, broken country. Well, we get our answers in Prodigy \u2013 even some than we didn\u2019t ask for. We get an insight into the past of the Republic, we find some informations about the Patriots, about what happened to the world as we know it.. I have a feeling that we might find in the next book some informations about Antarctica or China, or whatever country has better technology than the Republic and the Colonies \u2013 as we will need so much some advanced technologies to save us from a major heartbreak. JUNE I wasn\u2019t her big fan in the first book because it seemed to me that she had it all way too easy. It\u2019s true, she kind of lost everything, but she had this vibe (\u201coh, poor rich girl\u201d) that made not relate with her the way I wanted. Still, as I said before, what I liked about her was the consistency of her actions. You can see it in this book as well, she doesn\u2019t simply change her mind, she has doubts and she needs proofs before believing in something. She might agree with you, with doing something that you ask, but if she doesn\u2019t believe in it, if there is any chance that you might be wrong she will do whatever is needed to be done to make things right. June might be one of the best female characters I came across: she is strong, she is a great fighter, she is smart, she has principles and she stays true to herself. Having to fight against the Republic, against everything she was born to believe in doesn\u2019t make her weak. No, she sharpens her instincts, she fight to find hidden layers that might lead her to the truth underneath all those lies, those plots, those monstrosities happening in the Republic. DAY Sometimes I wonder how did he became so famous. He is supposed to be our new Robin Hood but all he does is run. I mean it literally. He is not much into fighting (but he has June to teach him), he doesn\u2019t know much about politics, he definitely can\u2019t read people and he trusts the wrong ones, his pain makes him weak, his loss vibrates through every cell in his body. I still feel deeply sorry for him because, no matter how much he loves June, the death of his family is eating him from the inside out. These things are not meant to make us dislike him. He is not perfect, he has tons of flaws, but they also make him tridimensional. He is not a doll, he has feelings, he is strong but he has weaknesses, he is fast but we are still able to catch up with him, to love him. All his life he tried to fight for other people, to help the poor, to save the innocent, but now he is the one in need to be helped, saved. He is tired and all he wants is to find his brother and forget about this war bigger than him. He dreams about a safe place to live with June, Eden and Tess \u2013 the most important people in his life, the ones he would give his life for. SIDE CHARACTERS We are at war and people come and go. We meet them, we start caring about them and then they are gone. Some die, some get lost, some you just wish they would die already. We find more about some of them (Thomas, Kaede, even Metias) and we would love to know less about others *caugh* Tess *cough* Some are meant to help us, some are not to be trusted and some will break our heart even though they make a short appearance. Anyways, the focus remains on our couple and the others are there only to make us see the whole picture \u2013 with the good and the bad. CONCLUSION If you loved Legend you will definitely love this one too. If you didn\u2019t love Legend you might actually love this one. If you are not into dystopia I am not sure if you\u2019ll love this one, but you might check it out just in case. As for me, I loved-loved-loved it!

I feel that this review should be divided in two parts. I won\u2019t lie, the first half of the book was boring for me. The story didn\u2019t catch me as well as the characters. To be honest, I didn\u2019t hate it, but it left me indifferent. But I have to say that Day is the only character that I loved from the very beginning to the end. I didn\u2019t even appreciate June in the first part of the book, not because I didn\u2019t like her behavior or something else, but because she left me indifferent. SOOOOO\u2026 This book. I feel that this review should be divided in two parts. I won\u2019t lie, the first half of the book was boring for me. The story didn\u2019t catch me as well as the characters.

For the second part of the book\u2026 it\u2019s another story. I really enjoyed it. And that ending\u2026 OH GOD! CAN\u2019T BELIEVE IT! I DON\u2019T ACCEPT IT! I WILL NEVER ACCEPT IT! The story started to take my attention and I started as well to empathize with June because I could see her change between the first book and this. I really loved the road that her relationship with Day took. And it was nice to see the development of the world, too. In general, I can say that I don\u2019t completely love the writing style but, of course, I like it. The thing I don\u2019t understand is why Marie wanted (if that\u2019s what she was trying to do) to put a triangle (or two?) in the book. I don\u2019t think it was necessary and it felt very rush. Except for Day and June (and maybe Anden), the other characters were pretty empty. Another post should be made for Eden which was spectacular in those few pages he had XD So, I can\u2019t say that I hated this book or loved this book. I liked it and, because of THAT ENDING, I\u2019m very curious to know what will happen in Champion. ...more So what if it took me 11 days to finish Prodigy ? At least I'm finally willing to look at any book again. I call that progress on a small scale, haha. I know that many people felt like Prodigy was a step-up over the first installment in the trilogy, and I can say that it did have quite a few areas of improvement over Legend when it came to showing more world detail. There was a great amount of time spent on bringing the bigger picture into focus, and it probably satisfied many of those who felt as So what if it took me 11 days to finish Prodigy ?

There was a great amount of time spent on bringing the bigger picture into focus, and it probably satisfied many of those who felt as if Legend was skimping out on the details of what made this government and world tick. It's probably strange that I was left feeling nostalgic for the simplicity of Legend . The relationship drama and all of the Tess nonsense didn't sit well with me. There's still something about reading these characters which feels like I'm watching kids play dress-up in their parents' clothing. Maybe that's the point the author is trying to make. But I'm still perplexed over the contradiction of these characters being completely innocent over affairs of the heart, yet they're still able to thwart the enemies in their paths and help the colonies work toward overthrowing the powers that be. It's all so ass-backwards to my mind. I can't say Legend started the trend of teenage boys who have lost their hormonal drive in favor of helping the greater good, but it's kind of weeeeiiirrddd. I'm not talking about the need for heavy romance (many don't care to see it in sci-fi). I just know that teen boys are well...teen boys. And that teens in general are never going to fully arrive at an evolutionary stage where they're so focused on fixing the world that they don't have normal um...drives? We're seeing teenagers tackle adult problems, but stepping backwards emotionally into early teen relationship mindsets. Are they kids or are they adults? I'm sure that some people would argue that this question is part of the outcome of kids being thrown into an adult world, but I'm not buying the way it's being spun. While Day has managed to hold on to some of his charm, June has become flat and emotionally unappealing to me. I'd almost liken it to being robotic. But...but... The last section of this book...it really pulled at my emotions. I thought it was a good call on Ms. Lu's part to do what she did on the June/Day front. This move had me rooting nervously for the characters all over again, the way that I did in book 1. Here's hoping that the finale will bring me back to what I liked about Legend . ...more Mo\u017eda sam subjektivna, ali Uzdanica mi je jo\u0161 bolja od Legende, bio je ovo pravi pravcati emotivni rolerkoster. Jako sam zavolela i Dana i D\u017eun. Nadam se samo da \u0107e tre\u0107i deo opravdati moja o\u010dekivanja, jer ovaj serijal po meni ima sve \u0161to jedan YA serijal treba da ima, atmosferu, dopadljive likove za koje mo\u017eemo da navijamo, uzbu\u0111enje i akciju i sasvim lepo dr\u017ei pa\u017enju. Jedva \u010dekam da se dokopam \u0160ampiona :) Ocena:4.5/5", "Title": "Prodigy"},
