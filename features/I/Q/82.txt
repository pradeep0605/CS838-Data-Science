He's such a pretty, shiny angel. *sigh* As I was saying... This book is amazing ly unnecessary . I'm sorry, Fangirls. Please don't eat me. Here is a general rundown. No specific twists are revealed just vaguely referenced, so possible spoilers: (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [ Part One Ch 1-2: Simon talks to people. Jace and Clary talk to each other and kiss. Ch 3-5: Simon talks to new guy. Jace and Clary talk to each other. Ch 6-8: Clary talks to people. Simon and Jace talk about Clary. Ch 9: Jace, Clary and Simon ALL make out...oops, I mean, Jace and Clary make out. Simon bites , ummmm, talks to girls and has relationship issues. Part Two Ch 10-11: New guy is revealed. Dun, dun, dun. Blah, blah. An attack!! Wonder woman saves the day. (Wow, something actually happened.... for two seconds) Vampire chat. Ch 12-13: People talk about the Vampire chat. Jace and Clary do stuff. Ch 14-15: Jace has issues. Chatty, chatty, chatty. Ch 16-17: Jace goes emo. Weird stuff is revealed. Ch 18-19: Clary believes in Jace. Things happen. Ch 20: Chatting again. Lovey dovey stuff. But wait - someone is alive! (Luke Skywalker scream - everyone join in with their best squeaky voice) NOOOOOOOOOOO! (hide spoiler) ] I have NEVER given out a one star rating before. NEVER! So trust me, I don't take this lightly at all and I don't enjoy being negative. Making light of a bad situation is just something I try to do. However, I don't like disliking things and I never try to be flat out hateful about anything . To love everything would be great, but that's just not realistic. Don't just write me off as a hater and leave it at that. I actually really liked the original series. Let me explain - While knowing nothing of Clare's plagiarism or the controversy surrounding the books, the need for something similar to Buffy overwhelmed me, leading to the discovery of the urban fantasy genre. My first experience with this genre was The Mortal Instruments which had just released the third book. Out of pure desperation, the fact that it was a derivative was not even almost a deterrent. Clare told a fast-paced and action filled YA suspense, which was exactly what I needed at the time. The first three Mortal Instruments had this addictive quality that made you need to read more, which led me to read this one. So while I still hold true to my original feelings of the first books and have a sick yet fond place in my heart for them, I truly feel that this particular series should have ended where City of Glass left us . It saddens me to think that I may have contributed to the mass production of unnecessary sequels. Or to Clare's dragon horde of GOLD. Oh well, she's rolling in it, already . What exactly she deserves to be rolling in... I'll leave up to interpretation. (view spoiler) [This is a joke. No speculation is actually necessary. She's rolling in money . Okay? Are you happy?! You better be. (hide spoiler) ] Regardless of how much she has made, it is respectable for anyone to make bookoos of cash doing what they love. As long as they aren't hurting or taking advantage of anyone, there's no problem with it. Although, sometimes large companies can take advantage of small time authors or even gullible readers, so it's a good thing that I got this from my library and didn't pay any of my own money (however, my library surely made a contribution). It's too bad lesser-known books and their authors don't get the opportunities and the recognition that some of these more mainstream novels do. But that isn't how the industry works right now. Hype sells. Controversy sells. Fellow girl-power groupies: don't kill me. I liked Jace in the original books. But I soon realized how destructive this small adoration can become. Now, Fangirl mobbing is truly my greatest fear. So I don't want to piss anyone off, but Jace is prick. A hot one, yes, and I readily admit to secret desires of being pursued by a \"bad boy\". But seriously? Calm yourselves. He's fictional. By the way that girls talk about him, you would think that his saliva is made of awesomesauce. Or that his face is made of The Ark of the Covenant. Don't look directly at him! Your skin might melt off. I wanted to like this and wanted my Jace crush to transfer over to this book. I swear I did. And maybe I was prepared to not like it because of a few certain friend reviews *cough* JillianHellionMajaVinaya *cough* But I tried. Really. Enjoying this just wasn't in my power. Objectivity is something we should all strive for with every read. Even after hearing bad things about a specific book, one can still have an open mind. When reviewing, we aren't trying to prove anyone right or wrong, we are just giving our own impressions about the book. Sometimes when an avid reader reads a mega-hyped book such as this, we can take on a similar persona to that of Bill and Ted. They are all about the excellent adventure . First and foremost with YA fantasy - we, mostly, want to be entertained. All the better if we learn something or absorb a good message while doing it, but the entertainment part is essential. Why I didn't like this book Not funny . At the time, I thought there was quite a bit of good humor in the originals. This one: nada. Or maybe I've just outgrown it. The corners of my mouth never even lifted. In fact, a scowl probably made an appearance or two....or twenty.\u00a0This book is to \"funny\" what vampires are to \"real\". (Hint: They aren't) Not entertaining . Every few pages I felt the need to go for a spin in my car with my head hanging out the window just to stay awake.\u00a0The suspense, the tension, the action - everything I liked about the originals was gone . I'd say this book is about 1% action, 99% chatting. I may have entertained myself about this book, but this book did NOT entertain me. Not for one second. Not new . This was a rehash of every conversation Jace and Clary and Simon had in the first books that took up an ENTIRE book. Clary, I love you but I can't because I think I'm evil. Jace, you're so emo. Simon, you're my best friend. This is a repeat. A rerun. And not even a funny rerun. It's like that sucky episode of Friends with <---C>Alec</---C> Baldwin in it that no one cares to remember. Not inspiring .\u00a0Unlike most of my favorite books, there wasn't anything to take away from this book. If we are not going to be entertained then shouldn't we at least learn something or feel like we derived some deeper meaning from the book? Both Ender's Game and The Hunger Games had serious messages about war. The Giver teaches us that human emotion is essential to our lives. What did City of Fallen Angels teach us? SERIOUS SPOILER AHEAD. DONT CLICK UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW. (view spoiler) [That it is okay to be a prick because you've been possessed by a demon? (hide spoiler) ] Maybe there was some deeper message and I just didn't see it because I was so bored. If so, I apologize for my oversight. Let's end on a high note, shall we? So I'll leave you with this: Even if I don't particularly like a book, I can usually find something good about having spent my time on it. This one was much more difficult to find that \"good part\", but I still managed to. So despite not laughing once as a result of a joke in the book, I found myself, alone, laughing hysterically in my room about how horribly pointless this book was or about random crap that I find funny, usually involving Jace and Clary. Somehow, I managed to amuse myself. Seriously. Dumb stuff dances through my head like a frisky stallion does through a meadow full of unicorns. I wonder if Jace is part unicorn, because unicorns are made of awesomesauce and rainbows..... I bet Jace is made of rainbows. Or at least, Clary seems to think so - Just wait until she figures out that he has NO pots of gold. And before I go find something awesome to read, I have something to ask you: Question: Quick! Both Jace and Clary are drowning. You can only save one. What should you do? Answer: (view spoiler) [LET THEM BOTH DROWN AND READ A DIFFERENT BOOK!!

I liked The Mortal Instruments. Yes, it was cheesy, it was derivative, and it was an embarrassment to good literature everywhere, but it gave me a couple of afternoons\u2019 worth of guilty pleasure, and I was satisfied. I enjoyed the fast-paced action and the triumph of true love, and I was happy to leave Jace and Clary to enjoy the fruits of their labour in happily-ever-after land. But then. As human society evolves, so do its methods of torture Let me start off this review with a small confession. I liked The Mortal Instruments. Yes, it was cheesy, it was derivative, and it was an embarrassment to good literature everywhere, but it gave me a couple of afternoons\u2019 worth of guilty pleasure, and I was satisfied. I enjoyed the fast-paced action and the triumph of true love, and I was happy to leave Jace and Clary to enjoy the fruits of their labour in happily-ever-after land. But then. Mammon beckoned, and Cassandra Clare fell into the trap. Not content with the adulation of her millions of teenyboppers and wannabe-teenyboppers (like me!) she decided to flog a dead horse. In addition to her derivation-of-a-derivative series (The Infernal Devices), she decided to revive Jace and Clary from their life of teenage bliss and torture them \u2014 and her readers \u2014 all over again. Unfortunately, she forgot some key elements in her rush to milk the cash cow. Elements that most readers tend to look for in their books. Minor things like plot, characterization and heart . Let me be honest here: CoFA is the worst excuse for a novel I have ever read. It is a waste of time, money and paper. Even as I turned each page, I could hear the groan of a million trees that gave up their lives to fulfill one person\u2019s fathomless desire for fame and money. Cassandra Clare says that she often gets asked where she derives the \u201cinspiration\u201d for her books. Thus far, she has kept that answer a closely guarded secret, but the truth WILL out, ladies and gentlemen! So here, without further ado, is the inspiration for The Mortal Instruments! The writing in this book is like the dry rattle of a dying man\u2019s throat. The slow crawl towards a climax is like watching the continental drift. The endless descriptions of what every person is wearing is like being forced to trawl through a random stranger\u2019s vacation photos. The unbelievable level of teenage angst in this book is like the \u2018Dear Diary\u2019 scrawls of a twelve year old. The ridiculousness of calling this a \u2018novel\u2019 and selling it for $11 is like... like... sorry, I can\u2019t think of anything \u2014 obviously I don\u2019t have Clare\u2019s talent for overblown similes! So, let\u2019s see what the \u2018plot\u2019 in this book is about... Okay, Simon\u2019s a vampire, but he\u2019s still trying to pretend to be a normal boy. He\u2019s turned into a playa, and is juggling two hot women at the same time. Then he gets accosted by a really old vampire who wants him to help her take over the Manhattan clan. But that\u2019s not important, because we never come back to that story. Moving on, Clary and Jace are supposed to be training, but mostly they\u2019re making out. One such session gets interrupted by Isabelle who tells them that a dead Shadowhunter has been found somewhere in the city. But let\u2019s not worry about that either, it\u2019s not very important. What\u2019s more important is that Jace is having some really disturbing nightmares in which he ends up hurting/killing Clary. So he decides that he\u2019ll talk to his mom about it. His mom suggests therapy, and Jace finds a therapist, who advises him to talk to Clary about his disturbed emotional state. Clary, having been told the whole story, begins to suspect that Jace may not be mentally disturbed at all, but the victim of a demonic attack. She takes him to the Silent Brothers who work their silent mojo, and together, Jace and Clary investigate the dead Shadowhunters, find the culprit, vanquish him/her and save the Shadowhunters. ......................... .......................................................... ....Oh wait. *embarrassed silence* Umm, actually, that\u2019s not how it goes. What actually happens is that Jace, because of this nightmare, decides that he will distance himself from Clary, whinge about their relationship endlessly, run away every time he so much as spots her in the distance, and mope miserably. But don\u2019t worry! He\u2019s not really breaking-up with her or anything! He\u2019s just nobly making her miserable and refusing to tell her why he\u2019s avoiding her. But every once in a while, his hormones emotions get the better of him, and he just tosses her up against an alley wall and plays out some abstinence porn. In the meantime, Simon the playa gets kicked out of his home and works some mind mojo on his mother to make her forget that she has discovered his secret life as a vampire. He feels miserable and guilty about this, but again, not to worry, it\u2019s only for about two pages. After that, he just walks around town being targeted by sweatsuit-ed assassins and checking out the long, thick eyelashes of the guy who comes to audition for his band, and feeding Jace tomato soup and mangoes and watching him sleep. Awww. Then there are random snippets about dead babies and more dead Shadowhunters and the faerie Queen psyching out Clary about how she might lose Jace and some moving, heart-rending conversations about Shadowhunter weddings, and more assassins in sweatsuits. But what about the super cool, super adorable Magnus, you ask? Take heart, dear reader, Magnus and Alec DO reappear about three-quarters into the book. When they promptly get into a fight about Magnus\u2019s long and colourful lovelife. Alec throws a jealous fit, gets sullen and asks random embarrassing questions that no-one wants to know the answer to, least of all me. Then more unnecessary things happen, culminating in a made-for-TV moment where Alec decides to pause in his attempts to save his sister, brother and fellow Shadowhunters to quiz Magnus\u2019s ex-girlfriend about Magnus\u2019s lovelife. I kid you not. In the meantime, those long-forgotten plots about dead Shadowhunters, dead babies, assassins in grey sweats merge with a last-minute, hastily-scrambled-together plot about a Greater demon and a villain who\u2019s back from the dead. .... oh, am I spoiling this for you? Anyway, this entire too-boring-for-words mess ends in a cliffhanger that is GUARANTEED to send you running for the nearest gun store. In my case, I handed my Glock 30 to my best friend and told her to shoot all ten rounds into my brain if I even thought about reading the next book. Amen. ...more I ahh, think that I....I don\u2019t know.... I literally just finished this book and I\u2019m at a loss of words to describe it. Was it brilliant? Yes! Was it fantastic? Yes! Was it worth the wait? Yes, yes, yes....lord yes! I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for this book an entire lifetime. Yes, that may seem weird, but that\u2019s how I feel. There have been waits for books that I thought would kill me-Richelle Mead's Last Sacrifice being a big one- but none like this. I was happy and satisfied when City of Glass I ahh, think that I....I don\u2019t know.... I literally just finished this book and I\u2019m at a loss of words to describe it. Was it brilliant? Yes! Was it fantastic? Yes! Was it worth the wait? Yes, yes, yes....lord yes! I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for this book an entire lifetime. Yes, that may seem weird, but that\u2019s how I feel. There have been waits for books that I thought would kill me-Richelle Mead's Last Sacrifice being a big one- but none like this. I was happy and satisfied when City of Glass ended, but learning that Clare decided to write more books was just the icing on the cake. It\u2019s been a while between books, but this was more or less everything I expected and more! It was different and yet completely the same. There\u2019s no way to pretend that the characters haven\u2019t changed--that they\u2019re not different and that everything that went into the storyline and plot of the first 3 books hasn\u2019t changed. That chapter of the series is over and a new dawn has emerged (yes, cheesy, I know, but sue me). The characters were still the amazing, incredible people that stole my heart throughout the first 3 books and being with them again was a lot like coming home from a long trip. I must say---I thought Jordan was an awesome inclusion! I always thought Maia\u2019s ex was a real jerk, but he\u2019s nothing like I thought or expected and I love that. I will admit that I did miss seeing more of Clary and Jace. They\u2019re still my fave everything of this series, fave characters, fave couple, but I still loved the book regardless. It was so strange getting such an in-depth look into Simon and following him the most. Obviously the books have always changed POV\u2019s, jumping back and forth, but it\u2019s always been fixed mostly on Clary, whereas this time it was more Simon than anything else. And yet... I didn\u2019t have a problem with that. I love Simon--always have--and even though I never wanted him to be the one Clary ended up with, I still wanted the best for him. He\u2019s still the same great Simon he\u2019s always been, but he\u2019s slightly different too. I think he\u2019s got a long way to go and there\u2019s a lot of growth that I think will happen to him. I can\u2019t wait to see though... It\u2019s odd, when the last book ended, if anyone had asked me, I\u2019d have been one of the few people who actually said they wanted Maia to be with Simon, but after this book it\u2019s plain to see that Izzy is the one that for him! Perhaps I\u2019m late to the party, but it always seemed to me that she was a bit much for him and (even though I love her, heart and soul) I didn\u2019t believe she was right for him. I honestly thought that Maia and he would have made a better couple, but after this book I\u2019ll never think that way again. Perhaps it was Jordan coming into the storyline and seeing how he and Maia were/are, but I finally looked and realised that Simon and Isabelle really have something. There\u2019s so much more to Izzy than we\u2019ve seen and I think that Simon may actually break through her defences and worm his way into her heart if she lets him! Oh, and it goes without saying that I want Maia and Jordan back together too. Hello? Weren\u2019t they just perfect together? The issues they have and Maia wanting to rip him to shreds aside. I was sad to see so many issues for Clary and Jace in this book, but I can\u2019t say I was surprised either. I knew Cassandra Clare wouldn\u2019t just let them be. It seems like they\u2019ve been through so much, but of course it\u2019s not the end for them, no sir-ee. There are more problems facing them and new struggles, but I don\u2019t doubt for a second that they can get through it.....somehow. That\u2019s not to say that I didn\u2019t love every single moment they were together, because I did. I absolutely did! The moments between Clary and Jace were electric. Every time they\u2019re together, every kiss, every time they touch, things just sizzle. I\u2019ve loved a lot of book couples over time, but none compared to them. They\u2019re like no other. You can\u2019t deny that they\u2019re made for one another, you can\u2019t miss the chemistry they have. It\u2019s truly impossible not to see and feel. They just go together so well, they both make each other better. Jace makes Clary stronger, and she\u2019s his whole world. She means he world to him and it makes me giggly inside (Yeah, yeah, yeah....I went there =D) This book was perfectly paced and the ending was a heart-stopping roller coaster ride. So much happened and I was on the edge of my seat, wanting to see how Simon, Jace and Clary would get out of things. I couldn\u2019t believe that Lilith was trying to bring Sebastian back. There\u2019s no one who deserves to stay dead more than him...well, perhaps expect Valentine. The ending of this book was jaw dropping. I. Could. Not. Believe. It! Still can\u2019t, if I\u2019m honest here. I cannot believe that Sebastian is alive again and what he\u2019s done to Jace. It\u2019s shocking, it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s heart-breaking, it\u2019s everything I didn\u2019t want, but at the same time I CANNOT wait to see what\u2019s going to happen next. The next book is going to be a showstopper--I can so tell\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to see what happens now. Can Clary and everyone else manage to free Jace from Sebastian? Can they defeat Sebastian? Just what does this mean now? God! I NEEEEEED the next book, like stat! Seriously, this series is just brilliant and I can\u2019t wait for the next instalment! Bring on the awesome! ...more I realized something, while being completely immersed in this sequel: I\u2019ve been a bad bad reader, in the past, toward this series. Not only because I\u2019ve postponed reading this book (in my defence, I really had to finish Clockwork Angel first so I can actually know who \u2018Camille\u2019 is) but also for another reason entirely. I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t care enough about the characters before, Alec & Magnus excluded. I didn\u2019t even try to. I mean, I liked them enough but\u2026 Alec & Magnus were the ones I realized something, while being completely immersed in this sequel: I\u2019ve been a bad bad reader, in the past, toward this series. Not only because I\u2019ve postponed reading this book (in my defence, I really had to finish Clockwork Angel first so I can actually know who \u2018Camille\u2019 is) but also for another reason entirely. I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t care enough about the characters before, Alec & Magnus excluded. I didn\u2019t even try to. I mean, I liked them enough but\u2026 Alec & Magnus were the ones I kept focusing on, in every single chapter and, when they weren\u2019t around, I was still thinking about them and processing and replaying in my mind what I\u2019ve just learned regarding them. Or felt. Craving for the next scene I\u2019ll see the lovely couple in was never something new to me. And that\u2019s, I think, not right. Being my favorite series ever , I should have paid more attention to the other characters too. Because they\u2019re great! This is the only The Mortal Instruments book in which I didn\u2019t miss doing that and discovered some new qualities and endearing information on the characters I\u2019ve known of before such as Simon (especially him), Jace and Isabelle. Clary is the heroine, so there barely is any \u2013 if none at all \u2013 secret she\u2019s keeping that we don\u2019t know about, but I did feel closer to her in this one too. That was my dirty little secret , heh. Oh well, I guess I\u2019ll have to re-read book 1, 2 & 3 for a third time. C\u2019est dommage. *wink* *wink* This book was actually fun, strangely. It felt more like an \u2018in between\u2019 written story than a sequel itself. It\u2019s like the author wanted to take some time off the actual immense and complex plot and focus really on the relationship between the characters. For instance, Clary & Jace, Simon & Maia & Isabelle (you go, man!), Jocelyn & Luke, Alec & Magnus, etc. And I loved this book for it. Of course, there was some actual action and mystery too, but I do admit it being slower than the two previous ones. However, it being different didn\u2019t make it disappointing at all. This book, like I mentioned, helped me connect with the cast more and I\u2019m grateful for it, since I will probably love the next two books *to the moon and back* because of it and not just *really really* love them. I don\u2019t think I ever realized how sweet and funny Simon actually is. Sarcastic, quite in fact, but a good kind of sarcastic. And Jace\u2026he appeared vulnerable in this. It was pleasant to see for once how much he loves Clary and being given proof for it. Or perhaps it is that this made me believe in their relationship even more. And Clary, well, as always, she can be na\u00efve and give her trust too quickly. But all that made a great melange and brought a nice atmosphere. Magnus is so cute. Awe moment : He touched her cheek. It was colder than the floor had been. \u2018\u2018You could give me the past,\u2019\u2019 he said a little sadly. \u2018\u2018But Alec is my future.\u2019\u2019 Woah, Magnus Bane can be romantic. Too bad Alec didn't hear...or did he? *grins* A must read! I have seen many being disappointed by this sequel but, still, don\u2019t hesitate if you\u2019re a fan of the series!

I've spent the morning wondering that exact same thing. So far I've come up with a handful of explanations, none of which are backed with much reason. ***SECRET SHAME ALERT!!!*** What can I say? I'm that person. You know, that pathetic moron who spends way too much time and energy believing in other people, even the ones who've done nothing but let me down in the past. In my defense I love seeing people live up to their potential. Yes, I actually believe Cassandra Clare has potential. (Now over half my friends and followers have lost all respect for me.) Or at least I did feel that way until I picked up this book. Now I don't know exactly how I feel about her. Before anyone unfriends me, please lemme 'splain. There are brief moments, between all the stolen storylines, ill-conceived plotting, melodrama and so-forth, in which I'm able to see that Cassandra Clare does have something unique and interesting to bring to the table. Even a few moments of--dare I say--complete brilliance that, had Ms Clare expanded on, could have gone somewhere great. Unfortunately I don't think Ms Clare knows that about herself so she spends most of her time lifting ideas from other people's work, pasting it together and trying to pass it off as her own. Either that or she really wishes she was Joss Whedon. And really, who could blame her? I wanna be Joss Whedon too--that way I could know all the ins and outs of the Firefly universe, but I digress. She failed at channeling Joss Whedon's brilliance though it is evident that she tried. Long story short: this book was like a slap in the face given to me by none other then a very smug Cassandra Clare. Serves me right for being dumb enough to believe in her, amirite? In-depth review to come. --- Initial reaction to the new cover to this book: Can I just say how irritated I am that Clary and Jace are pretty much front and center in this book? Clary is even on the freaking cover. I thought this story was going to focus on Simon, so what's with the return of The Jace & Clary Quasi-Incest Show? I just don't care about them anymore and I desperately wish they'd just go away. Forever. I know I'm going to read this only to wish I hadn't. Why? Because I can't stay away from these stupid books. Kill me. -- ...more Okay, let me level with you. Just to put this review into perspective, I'd like to make it common knowledge that I gave all three of the books in the Mortal Instruments five feckin' stars. I loved them. I was not blind to their flaws, and they are not literary masterpieces, but they were far too much fun for me to care about what was wrong with them. For the first time in so long I was able to just sit back and not cringe or roll my eyes or make any backhanded comments about the pathetic charact Okay, let me level with you. Just to put this review into perspective, I'd like to make it common knowledge that I gave all three of the books in the Mortal Instruments five feckin' stars. I loved them.

For the first time in so long I was able to just sit back and not cringe or roll my eyes or make any backhanded comments about the pathetic characters. I took to the Shadowhunters, dug the storyline, and zipped through all of the books within two weeks with a grin on my face the entire time. So what on earth happened here? I was absolutely pumped when I found out that the awesome City Of Glass was not the end of the series. PUMPED. I waited, with baited breath, to rush out to Coles and get my newest fix, partly because I needed me some more Jace and partly because I needed me some more sexy fun time with Magnus and Alec. Oh, boy, was I wrong about that! The writing didn't disappoint me that much, but I'm not going to spend much time debating the ins and outs of Cassie's prose. If you want to what my opinion is on the way she writes go check out my review of City of Bones . Let's backtrack here. Things in this world today that irritate me: a) Lite-brites b) Misogynists c) Mini Pop Kids d) Scabs on my ears e) Fall Out Boy scaring us with a huge unnecessary hiatus See that? See those normal, annoying things that I am perfectly entitled to be annoyed about? Now, the reason why I state these things is to convince you that I am not an angry, pissy person with unreasonable standards, and to firmly convey the fact that since I am not an angry, pissy person with unreasonable standards, this is in no way a bitchy, over-the-top hissy fit. Though it may look and sound exactly like a bitchy, over-the-top hissy fit in every single conceivable way, I can assure you, this is not a bitchy, over-the-top hissy fit . rant/ What the fucking fuck happened here? What the actual HELL is this book's deal? What is wrong with Cassie? Did she begin daytime drinking? Jace has become an aggressively boring Cullen knock-off with some kind of lame-ass inferiority complex that actually dares manifest itself in the form of \"don't come near me, I'm dangerous\". Like, are you shitting me with this? You're actually going to get up on a soapbox and admit to the world that you've stopped trying, Cassie? It's like she's not even ashamed of the fact that this series has devolved from a solid fantasy quest to a huge screaming shitstorm of teenage feelings and internet in-jokes that were barely funny on Windows '98 and are cracked with the same enthusiasm as a dead cat has toward the concrete floor it rots on. Like you actually expect me to sit here and enjoy reading about Jace's sad yet rippling muscles and Clary's sad red hair and all their sad, sad love that belongs in the YA bargain bin along with Luce/Daniel, Nora/Patch, Beth/Xavier and the rest of the motley cheesemance crew. Just don't even provoke me. Don't approach me and start a conversation about this appalling excuse for a power couple. I'll just start swearing offensively. And where the fuck were Alec and Magnus? They didn't make an appearance until chapter fucking twelve, and the cardboard cut-outs that waded through the nothingness that is this book's plot were shadows of the characters I fell in love with in previous installments. What happened to Alec? He's a prick! What happened to Magnus? He's a bore! What happened to this pairing? They're dull as shit! What the hell makes Clare think that anybody would want to read about two people revolving blankly around each other and recycling the same conversation over and over and over again and eventually coming to no conclusion but \"we'll cross that bridge when we come to it\". How is that even anything? How does that make any sense at all? How does it make any sense to keep Magnus and Alec absent until chapter twelve even though they're two of the most popular characters in the whole series? They rake in fans like nobody's business and I actually recall talking to one of my friends about this series and us both agreeing that the only reason we were even pursuing it further than COG was the promise of Magnus and Alec's relationship, which has stopped being touching and heartfelt and started being weird and mildly creepy since Alec started behaving like a kid and Magnus an old fart. I don't get it! I don't! Then we have the plot which is like the Overture on the Sound Of Music DVD. Nobody gives a shit about it, it may as well not be there, and honestly the best thing to do is to just fast-forward through it. What even happens? Everyone stands around talking, Clare describes everyone's clothing, and then there are demon babies and Lilith and that's when I stop giving a tiny rat's ass about my loyalty to this series because when you break the Rule of Abeko, you break my interest in defending your shit. So basically, the plot was balls. The whole thing was balls. It was like a big glass of distilled water. It looks like nothing and tastes like nothing and it's so utterly devoid of substance that it may as well not exist at all. How glad am I to see Sebastian back? No, not very. Okay, I'll go with it because I guess it sort of passes as a new story arc, but by the way this thing ended I'm expecting some shitty inner monologue where Jace whines about not being able to control himself and what did I say about Mormon vampires? Don't get me started on the whole Simon/Maia/Isabelle thing. The less said about that the better. I'm just so done with all of these simpering caricatured characters. There is absolutely no substance left to them. They're like those wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men posted in front of car dealerships - they're really tall and loud and there are a lot of colours to look at but when you really think about it, they're really fucking pointless and they don't look jazzy or cool, they just look really stupid, standing in the same spot and thrashing their limbs like dying bumblebees. Make it stop! I'm literally gasping for breath right now. Thank all the gods of this ugly earth that I can shut the back cover of this book and never ever open it again on pain of death. /rant Bonus Time!

I liked it, but it wasn't as great as the earlier books, in my opinion. It was lukewarm for me, at best.

I liked it, but it wasn't as great as the earlier books, in my opinion. It was lukewarm for me, at best. While the third book seemed to leave off on a promising note, this book quickly rained on my parade. Just when I thought that they were making progress in their war against \"evil\", everything goes and gets messed up again. The guys, in particular, were grating on my nerves. Simon is a huge focus in this book. He spends most of his time trying to juggle his relationships with Maia and Isabelle. He feels kind of guilty for two-timing both of the girls, who also happen to be friends...but not guilty enough to choose or to stop. This time around, the girls aren't the only ones that want to get their hands on Simon. His special \"day walker\" blood has made him a hot commodity. Some want to protect him, while others would like to use or kill him. Several new characters were introduced that kept things interesting. Like Simon, Jace spends a lot of time screwing up his personal life in this book. His behavior is all over the place. He spends a great deal of time distancing himself from Clary, nearly ruining their relationship. Again, the guys were driving me bonkers! They were really messing up my mojo. In the end, some big events transpired and more secrets came to light. This may not have been a total win for me, but I can appreciate that this book has paved the way for future events in the series. I am still enjoying the series as a whole and I can't wait to see where it is heading. I'm on to the fifth book now. ...more Wow, there's four days of my life spent reading this book that I'll never get back. And it normally doesn't take me that long, but I had to self motivate myself with promises of chocolate (\"If you just read one more page...\"), just to get through it. I usually don't give too many books only 1 star. In fact there is only one book I can think of that angered me this much and that was The Vampire Diaries: The Return. I only got 50 pages deep into it before I flung it across the room. So I am very pr Wow, there's four days of my life spent reading this book that I'll never get back.

There is NO reason this book should have a higher rating than Mockingjay, a few Harry Potter books, and The Pride and the Predjudice. NO REASON. After all of that, I have one question for Cassandra Clare: Was this some sort of sick April fool's joke? Why was this even published? Now before the fangirls come out to defend their master , let me explain. I actually liked the original 3 books. I wouldn't say I loved them or call them literary masterpieces, but I *did* find them entertaining. City of Endless Angst City of Fallen Angels picks up 2 months after City of Glass left off. One would think the conflict between Jace and Clary was over, but no. CC has the nerve to regress her characters. And there lies my biggest problem with the book: WHERE WAS THE PLOT? While everyone was busy fawning over each other, Shadowhunters are being murdered! But, alas, no one gives a shit. How would I describe our characters in CoFA, you ask? Well a picture is worth a thousand words: Draco Jace: Bordered between and Wangsty teen and a cocky prick And yes kids, he actually says he is better than everyone. Clary: \"He loves me. He loves me not.\" Simon: I really liked him in the orignial trilogy. I found him funny. Sadly, he was boring. He wandered around this book with not a clue what was going on. Alec and Magnus: *sigh* They didn't even show up until half the book was over. And when they did all they did is bitch about Magnus' past sex life. Yes, more and more angst. The gang is supposed to be investigating the murders of the shadowhunters, but there isn't much investigating going on. Instead, they are too busy ignoring each other, going to Simon's band gigs, and ripping each other's clothes off in an alley. Speaking of Simon, he is apparently dating Isabelle and Maia at the same time. Yet, he doesn't know how it happened. Ya, Simon, we already established that you are confused. What's driving Jace and Clary apart? Well, Jace starts having these nightmares where just as he and Clary are ripping away their clothes, he kills her. He decides to ignore her, so as not to hurt her. Why Clare, why? Why did you have to play the \"I love you, can't you see it's killing me?!\" card? Stephenie Meyer already cashed in on that lotto ticket amoungst other recent, pathetic YA novels. To top it off, we have evil minions in gray track suits and sneakers and a badass villain killed in the most shitty ending I have ever read. And that cliffhanger! Not everyone who dies has to come back to life, Clare. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Valentine makes an appearance in the next two books. Clare is also very inconsistent with her storyline. When Kyle is first introduced to us he has black hair. However, two pages later he has brown hair. Jace doesn't believe in God, yet has the most angel blood in him that anyone else. The *Pepsi* sign is blue and red, not Coca Cola. Jace doesn't understand any of the pop culture references Simon quotes, but Jace spews Shakespeare lines off like its second nature. Seriously, why didn't the editors catch this? Does my review seem like it's all over the place? Well, good cause that's exactly how this book was. ALL.OVER.THE.DAMN.PLACE. A few days ago Clare posted a FAQ about the book and ending. She is basically validating why she, Almighty Author, is a genius and you, lowly reader, are an idiot. You can read it here if you haven't already. http://cassandraclare.livejournal.com... And you know what I have to say to her little condescending FAQ? Cassandra Clare, I'm calling you out on the bull shit. It's time to stop riding J.K. Rowling's cash cow. Get off, the ride is over!

The fact that Clare continued the story is not my problem; it is the manner in which the plotline has been executed (which to reiterate lacks the element of surprise) that disappoints me. \u201cCity of Glass\u201d ended definitively - bad, bad Valentine is dead, the seeds of harmony have been sewn between Nephilim and Downworlders, and Jace and Clary get their mushy, predictable happily ever after. It seems as though with this newest installation, Clare asked herself, \u201cHow can I possibly continue this?\u201d and unfashionably, she dug up open ended dramatic quotes, such as \u201cto love is to destroy\u201d, and used them in order to create tension. Instead of putting faith in the audience\u2019s imagination to keep her story alive, our beloved author took the task into her own hands and ironically, destroyed all that she forged with love. Clary and Jace start to have relationship problems. Magnus and Alec start to have relationship problems. Simon is dating two girls simultaneously, one of which would realistically have never given him the time of day, because his latest vampirism is apparently a way for Isabelle to see the goodness of his heart and appreciate him beyond his looks (not that those enhanced cheekbones aren\u2019t delicious). Oh, and I almost forgot, Sebastian Verlac/Jonathan Morgernstern isn\u2019t quite dead! I feel almost insulted; Cassandra Clare is treating us, the audience, as though we are infantile, or to borrow her words, as the \u201cmundanes\u201d that her characters so obviously despise. Instead of providing us with a decent, realistic plotline, Clare\u2019s chosen to do nothing other than sever all that she previously created with her words. I will admit, if you\u2019re looking for a quick fix, \u201cCity of Fallen Angels\u201d is quite an easy and enjoyable read. The fact that this installation is Simon-centric was a pleasant attempted insight into the undead life - a brilliant contradiction - of the otherwise nerdy, annoying tagalong who unfortunately happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Jordan Kyle, despite the ridiculous name, was an interesting addition considering the tumultuous past with Maia (if you can get past the tortured internals soap opera). And don't you dare forget this season\u2019s Big Bad, Lilith - yes, it's that demon bitch in yet another fantasy! Besides the astounding fact that Clare is too lazy to create her own villain and has decided to steal from God, she didn't even let this melodramatic page-turner develop on her own! Why must Clare handfeed me all the information? Alec and Isabelle spitting out past lectures on Greater Demons seemed to be a cheap attempt at unravelling whatever mystery that Lilith was. She ran away from Adam and God said \u201cThou shalt be barren forever, infidel!\u201d? That\u2019s a wonderful backdrop there, Ms. Clare, but could you be any more subtle? Having one of your characters race through the history as though it were ordering lunch is not in the least bit believable. I want you to show me, not hold my hand and tell me what I need to cram before the big exam. All I ever see nowadays is young adult novels being dominated by devastatingly beautiful characters. It would be unfair for me to blame only Clare for this trend, but she never needed to follow it. The fact that Clare seems to think her fan base will stay tethered to her through the creation of beautiful superhumans makes me question her writing skills - does she not have the ability to keep her audience enthralled with unattractive characters? Actually, let\u2019s take a step back: why are only the superhumans beautiful? Simon as a human - a nuisance, and nothing much to look at. Simon as a vampire - handsome and having trouble juggling the ladies. Clary as a mundane - androgynous body shape; no breasts, no hips. Clary as a Shadowhunter - one up the bra size! Look at those hips form! Apparently, not only is New York full of gorgeous creatures, but not one of them is human. Way to be realistic, huh? In the end, however, what bothers me the most is how desperate Clare is to save her characters falling from grace. Simon, in spite of toying with two potential girlfriends simultaneously, is forgiven by each! And that wretched Mark of Cain? Yes, the sevenfold vengeance is all very lovely, but what about the other part of the curse - \u201cthou shalt wander the earth a fugitive\u201d? If Simon is cursed to be a wanderer until the end of eternity, then how was Isabelle rushing to his aid? Why is Jace choosing to go to Simon, why is Clary still his best friend, and why is Kyle his protector? How could they possibly choose him if there is a powerful, binding curse that is constantly working to separate Simon from his loved ones? We know that the curse works because assassins impressively crumble to salt at Simon\u2019s feet, so why on earth are we ignoring the second-half, the depressing part of the curse? I\u2019m torn between branding it an obvious plot-hole, or just Ms. Clare\u2019s overwhelming desire not to let one of her beloved characters exist alone. In my eyes, this undermines Clare\u2019s integrity as a writer - if she cannot commit to the maxim she has presented for Simon, then how much can we truly trust her storytelling skill? The first three books, riddled as they were with bona-fide plot holes and histrionic dialogue, were to a degree more fathomable. Clare created a definitive story arc I could readily engage with. While \u201cCity of Fallen Angels\u201d didn\u2019t make me contemplate skewering my eyeballs or washing my brain with bleach, it is not one I will return to in the near future. Instead of keeping me on my toes, Clare cheaply proffered a broken story arc for a few more minutes in the spotlight, and ultimately destroyed her credibility as a writer who values constancy. You can keep a story going on forever, but sometimes, you just aren\u2019t meant to. ...more 3 Everybody hurts Stars Spoilers This one wasn't as good for me as the others.

A thousand times more interesting than Clary and Jace combined. Plus, whenever Jace came around in Simon's POV, I actually liked Jace again. Sulking Jace dampens the fun. A witty, cocky, jackass Jace brings smiles. Especially bickering and bonding with Simon. The plot was expected. The direction wasn't shocking nor was it lame. Just predictable.

The manuscript must have been at least five times worse if it hadn't seen an editor yet. What was this agent smoking? Because whatever it is, can I have some? It might relieve some of my stress.

Cassandra Clare, it is time to be honest. You are not an author. You are not a writer. You are a spewer. You don't care enough about your writing or readers to carefully piece together a plot or think over whether or not you actually need another 5 sequels. You are in this for the money, and the money only. Can you at least put a disclaimer on the book, so nobody else has to waste their time and money?

The only thing I decided to continue this series because I want to get more of Jace and Alec and Magnus, that's all. \u201cStill I pictured having you for fifty, sixty more years. I thought I might be ready then to let you go. But it's you, and I realize now that I won't be anymore ready to lose you then than I am right now. Which is not at all.\u201d ...more I watched Cassie Clare read this to some kids in France on youtube, the parts she read werent even connected to the plot, it was just about 2 pages worth of rising action, and i already have it marked down onnmy calander.

When i found out she was writing another book?forget about it. Im getting that book the day it comes out wether i have a ride or not. i will walk there. i love how Ms. Clare writes with a rhythem that makes everything flow and work, all of her charactors have different personalities. I like that she has Magnus Bane, the warlock,as a smart and powerful guy thats hilariuos in personality and Issabelle, the girly model who fights like Superwoman or something. and Clary the small fragile girl that has more power than you would think. Her main charactor Clary never got on my nerves like some charactors and it never got confusing. City of Bones, Ash, and Glass had so many twists and turnes that I'm wondering what other twists will Ms. Clare come up with next? I cant wait to find out. I also like that she doesnt discriminate when it comes to gay people. Alec and Magnus love each other for personality and not looks or blood. Alec doesnt mind that Magnus is a downworlder. just like Clery still loved Jace when she thought he was her brother. I cannot wait for Ms. Clare's next book City of Fallen Angels. ...more For those who haven't read it: The \u201calleyway kiss\u201d from Jace\u2019s perspective.

Shock at first, blanching into pain. He has hurt her before. Never because he wanted to, though he has lashed out in his own blindness\u2014like the time she walked in on him kissing Aline and he said every awful thing he could think of, as if the words themselves might have the power to make her disappear, to send her back where she was safe. He has always cared more about her safety than anything else. If he didn\u2019t, none of this would be happening. Jace wonders if she can see the terror in his eyes, the shards of all those dozens of dreams in which he stabbed her or choked her or drowned her and looked down at his hands afterward, wet with her blood. She backs up a step. There is something in her face, but it isn\u2019t fear. It\u2019s infinitely worse. She turns, almost tripping in her haste to get away, and rushes out of the club. For a moment he stands and looks after her. This is exactly what he wanted, a part of his mind screams at him. To drive her away. To keep her safe, away from him. But the rest of his mind is watching the door slam behind her and seeing the final ruin of all his dreams. It was one thing to push it to this point. It is another to let go forever. Because he knows Clary, and if she goes now, she will not ever come back. Come back. Somehow he is outside the club. The rain is pelting down like gunfire. He sees everything in a single sweep, the way he always has, the way he was trained to do. The white van at the curb, the slant of the street as it curves back toward Greenpoint, the dark opening of an alley behind the bar, and Clary at the corner, about to cross the street and walk out of his life forever. She yanks her arm out of his when he reaches for her, but when he puts his hand against her back, she lets him guide her into the alley. His hand slides across her back to her arm as she whirls to face him\u2014and he can see everything around them again: the wet brick wall behind them, the barred windows, the discarded musical equipment soaking in puddles of rainwater. And Clary is lifting her face, small and pale; her mascara runs in glittery streaks beneath her eyes. Her hair looks dark, pasted to her head. She feels both fragile and dangerous in his grasp, a glass explosive. She jerks her arm away from his. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning to apologize, don\u2019t bother. I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d He tries to protest, to tell her he only wanted to help Simon, but she is shaking her head, her words like stinging missiles. \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t tell me? Couldn\u2019t text me a single line letting me know where you were? Oh, wait. You couldn\u2019t, because you still have my goddamned phone. Give it to me.\u201d He reaches to hand the phone back to her, but he is barely aware of his movements. He wants to say, No, no, no, I couldn\u2019t tell you. I can\u2019t tell you. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m afraid of hurting you even though I don\u2019t want to. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m afraid of becoming my father. Your faith in me is the best thing in my life and I can\u2019t bear to destroy it. Instead, he blurts out other words. \u201cForgive me-\u201c He face goes white, her lipstick starkly bright against her skin. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you think I\u2019m supposed to forgive you for. Not loving me anymore?\u201d She moves away from him and blindly stumbles, and he can\u2019t stop himself: he reaches for her. She is delicate and shivering in his arms and they are both soaking wet and he can\u2019t stop. Her mouth is part open, and he brings his own lips down against hers, tasting lipstick and sweet ginger and Clary. I love you. He can\u2019t say it, so he tries to tell her with the pressure of his lips and his body and his hands. I love you, I love you. His hands are around her her waist, lifting her, and he had forgotten: she isn\u2019t fragile; she is strong. He fingers are digging into his shoulders, her mouth fierce against his, and his heart is pounding like it\u2019s trying to get free of his body as he sets her down on a broken speaker. Stop, his mind is telling him. Stop, stop, stop. He forces his hands away from her and places them on the wall, on either side of her head. Only that brings his body closer to hers, and that is a mistake. He can see the pulse slamming in her throat; her lipstick is gone now, and he can\u2019t look away from the carnation-pink of her mouth, flushed from kissing, as she breaths, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you talk to me? Why can\u2019t you look at me?\u201d His heart is pounding as if it wants to leave his body and take up independent residence somewhere else. \u201cBecause I love you.\u201d It is the truth, and an inadequate truth at that, but he feels it punch through him with the force of a lie. Her face softens, her eyes widening. Her hands are against him, small and delicate and careful, and he leans into her, breathing the scent of her under the smell of rainwater. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he hears himself say. \u201cI\u2019m sick of trying to pretend I can live without you. Don\u2019t you understand that? Can\u2019t you see it\u2019s killing me?\u201d He is drowning, and its too late. He reaches for her like and addict reaching hopelessly for the drug he has sworn not to touch again, having decided it is better to burn up in one final blaze than live forever without it. And the gray world blazes up around him with color as they come together, bodies slamming hard against the wall behind them. The water soaking her dress has made it as slick under his fingers as motor oil. He catches and pulls at her, desire reshaping their bodies with every touch. Her breathing is ragged in his ears, her eyelids half-closed and fluttering. He is touching her skin everywhere he can: her throat; the back of her neck; her collarbones, hard under is fingertips; her arms, smooth and slippery. Her hands are on him, too, no shyer than his own, and every touch seems to burn away the rain and the cold. She is gripping his shoulders when she raises her legs and wraps them around his waist, and he makes a noise he didn\u2019t even know he could make. It is too late to go back now. His hands clench involuntarily, and he feels the fabric of her tights rop under his fingers, and he is touching her bare skin. And their kisses taste like rain. And if he wasn\u2019t falling before, he is falling now. He thinks of the Fall, of angels tumbling forever in fire, and of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun. He had thought of the agony of the Fall, the terror of it, but never that it might be joyful. Lucifer had not wanted to fall, but neither had he wanted to serve. As Jace gathers Clary close against him, closer than he ever thought they could be, he wonders if it is only in the act of falling that one can be truly free. ...more I remember watching a scene in a sitcom where two people were talking about a soap opera they enjoyed.

The guy admitted he was behind on it because he'd stopped watching it a few years before. The woman replied, \"That's okay. You stopped around [insert whatever event]? Well, it's later that same day and... blah-blah.\" Soap operas do this really weird thing where time seems to stagnate and a lot of events happen in a small window. Actors and actresses may change out, but they'll still ride the same very prolonged story arch into the ground. I immediately felt that way when I picked up City of Fallen Angels. The original trilogy takes place during a few weeks of one summer. The problem with doing this is it makes Clary and Jace's relationship drive me utterly insane. (Alright, maybe it did that in other ways, but this my friends is the icing on the seven layer cake.) They've known each other a few weeks -- thought they were siblings for a significant portion of that time, but their romance is supposed to be epic, see-into-your-soul, and not at all just about lust... which you can maybe buy if not for the fact that they've spent a couple of weeks together. Unrealistic portrayals of romantic love are nothing new to the YA fantasy genre, but the timeline here is exceptionally bad. The story was originally supposed to be Simon's story with the rest of the cast taking a more backseat role. I was surprised to switch to Clary's POV in the first few chapters but not really shocked. Clare has a big problem with POV. She switches it on a whim and in the middle of scenes. You are constantly privy to thoughts and ideas you really should have been allowed to come to on your own through subtext. The story is primarily told through Simon and Clary's POVs, but that doesn't stop scenes from Isabelle's POV (something that came out of no where in my opinion) and, of course, the boy wonder Jace's POV. Sometimes a scene is from one character's POV when it would be so, so much more interesting to get it from someone else's. When you really want to know what Jace is feeling you get Clary's POV and observations on why he is the way he is instead of just direct insight. To me, it came across as a bit of a hot mess. I don't particularly enjoy first person books, but I really hate all this over the shoulder jumping. Clare has no idea how to transition or keep focus. It felt lazy and cheap. For example: tossing us into Alec's raging jealousy for a few pages. We didn't benefit from it at all; the story didn't benefit from it at all. It wasn't necessary, we got that he was jealous in other scenes and it added nothing to the story except pages... Which is something City of Fallen Angels is light on -- pages. It's probably the slimmest book in the series? I expected a brick. I thought if she had more story to tell we were going to get walloped with it. The thin book and the severe plot holes made me feel like this book was a money making gimmick more than anything else. A lot of reviewers I respect have called the first three books out for some lazy writing or sloppy fantasy building. I only wish they could read this book. It never once felt like there was actually more story to tell. Maybe it took a fourth book for me to appreciate that City of Glass ended the right way. It felt a lot more solid than the new plots thrown at us... and I could say I felt they were thrown in there literally. The new plots were not woven into the old, just dropped down like a brick house. There's some stuff going on with Simon and the vampires, but it's pretty paltry. Simon's plots contribute to Clary and Jace's plot, not vice verse, which to me is an important distinction. His story wasn't exactly stronger, but it was more interesting. I wanted to know more about what happened with his acclimation to being a vampire a hell of a lot more than I wanted to hear Clary and Jace lament over and over again about how unworthy they were of one another. I wanted to slap the two of them with a copy of Romeo and Juliet and tell them to try the cold embrace of death so they could always, always be together. Given the time frame and the sibling factor, Clary and Jace barely got to be together before the BIG PLOT in this book tears them apart all over again. We get to see very little of them actually being together. It really is mostly wangsting about how Clary's mother thinks Jace is Valentine revisited and how Jace half agrees with her. Jocelyn is my next point. She's all DPS (Disappearing Parent Syndrome) in the original trilogy. She's out of her coma now and around to let Clary know she Disapproves of her romantic relations... Um. God. It so reminded me of Linger's follow up to Shiver where Grace's absentee parents pay attention long enough to hate on Sam. Jocelyn disapproves of Jace because he was raised by Valentine... Yeah, well Clary is Valentine's biological child, Jocelyn. If crazy is hereditary I'd be more worried about my own little red haired super villain before poking at other people's kids. Jace was only half raised by Valentine. Half his life was with the Lightwoods and he almost exclusively thought he was a Wayland! On top of that he is ACTUALLY a Herondale. (And, yes, I hate myself for knowing all of these names so perfectly.) Valentine had some influence, but seriously, it felt like a really obscure thing to be worried about. If we have to worry about Jace's childhood and development be more concerned that every adult in his life has been untrustworthy to one degree or another. I'll read the next book for three reasons: 1. I don't want these books to have exclusive 5 star ratings they don't deserve. 2. I have thus far resisted the urge to ever rate a book I haven't read. 3. I want to see if a 'plot' actually develops. I preordered this book with Red Glove and I've got to say of the two Holly Black's series has been the better experience for me. I plan on rereading and reviewing it next because I kind of tore through it in a fit of joy... what?

My main problem with it was, this was originally going to be a trilogy. And although a lot was left open-ended at the end of the third book, it still felt like a happy ending. The main villain was dead (and the other villain was probably dead), most of the romantic issues were solved, yada yada. And they all lived happily ever after, right? \u2026 Well, apparently not. You know what this reminds me of? \"Into the Woods\" (the musical). I don't mean plot-wise. Just the fact that it's like, \"So they all lived happily ever after!\" And then you come back after intermission, and you find out that in the second half of the story, everyone gets stomped on by a giant. There are no giants in Mortal Instruments, but there are creepy-as-hell demons that want to kill everybody\u2013\u2013so that's just as bad. I didn't have a problem with most of the added-on conflict. I mean, there were a lot of issues from the third book that had yet to be solved. Like, how would Simon adjust to life as a vampire? How would he deal with the whole Maia/Isabelle issue? What happened to Sebastian/Jonathan's body? Yada yada. I'm glad that Cassandra Clare addressed these issues and expanded on some things. I like that Maia and her backstory were developed a lot more in this book. And I liked Isabelle a lot more in this book, too. I also liked that Cassandra Clare brought the whole Clockwork Angel story into it a bit more. Then ... Jace and Clary. Ohhh mannn. Well, all right, I've always disliked Clary. She's pretty stupid and obnoxious. I have been a die-hard Jace fan from the start ... but as much as I love him, I have to say he was being TOTALLY ANNOYING. It was frustrating enough to watch their relationship go on and off for three books, so then it was all the more satisfying to see them get together in the end. And while they were still acting like sane people for the first fifty pages or so, it was like, \"Awwww, they're such a cute couple!\" But just like that, Jace goes back to being his old, \"STAY AWAY FROM ME! I'M EEEEEVIL!\" self. Even though he knows he's not a demon and all. \"But Valentine still raised me so like maybe his evil-ness rubbed off on me or something!\" And \u2026\u00a0well \u2026 if I were having recurring dreams about stabbing my girlfriend, I guess I'd be pretty upset, too. (view spoiler) [Also, he's sort of possessed by a demon and stuff ... (hide spoiler) ] But that doesn't mean he has to be such an asshole! Like, \"I CAN'T BE WITH YOU. I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT YOU.\" Gosh. Really? And then \u2026\u00a0THE ENDING OH GOD THE ENDING. I literally threw the book across the room, I was so angry. (view spoiler) [I hate cliffhangers with a fiery passion. Why do I torture myself by reading so many series? Whyyy? Clary, you dummyhead, don't leave people alone when they've been possessed by demons! And Jace, you dummyhead, don't go raising evil people from the dead\u2013\u2013being possessed is no excuse!!! But, okay. It was pretty obvious that Sebastian would come back. If someone's body goes missing in a book, you KNOW they're going to become a problem later on. So I had a feeling things were going to end this way. Just not quite this badly. Like, if one of them dies they both die? AAAHHHHH! Actually, that's really awesome. How will Cassandra Clare work her way out of this one? Guess we'll have to wait and see ... (hide spoiler) ] BUT, I still loved it, as frustrating as it was. I'm in love with the plot and characters. These books are exciting and twisted and hilarious. They're just \u2026\u00a0great. Although, I'm looking forward to Clockwork Prince slightly more than I'm looking forward to City of Lost Souls. :) ...more After reading The Infernal Devices, I didn't think the last half of The Mortal Instruments would live up to the expectations that the prequels set, and this book proved me right.

Relationship drama between Ma After reading The Infernal Devices, I didn't think the last half of The Mortal Instruments would live up to the expectations that the prequels set, and this book proved me right. At least just in this case. City of Fallen Angels is by far my least favorite book in this series. This book was just filled with stupid relationship drama. Relationship drama between no other than Clary and Jace. No surprise there! Relationship drama between Simon, Isabelle, and Maia. Relationship drama between Maia and Kyle. Relationship drama between Magnus and Alec. It seemed like Cassandra Clare stirred up all this drama with literally ALL the couples in the beginning of the book only to bring them all back together again by the end of City of Fallen Angels. Clary and Jace have literally been dying over the fact that they weren't able to be together because of that \"thing\", but now that situation got cleared up in City of Glass, they're free to finally be together and make up for lost time. But of course, that doesn't happen and more drama comes up between them that creates all this unnecessary angst in the relationship that can simply be solved with straightforward, basic communication. But nope. Apparently communication has become such a hazard. So instead, they make out and verge on having sex in almost every scene instead of actually working out their problems. I had to skip all their scenes because 99% of the time they were making out and groping each other. I can't wait to see what new relationship problems they have next in City of Lost Souls. YAY. -____- On top of that, Clary is still a BRAT. Jace is back to being his depressed, self-loathing self again. Alec was acting like a whiny, jealous boyfriend. Simon even managed to irk me in this book. The plot twists weren't even plot twists considering how I called them from the beginning. This book was just a disaster for me. Period. 80% of this book consisted of everybody and their relationship problems and the other 20% is actual plot progression. To be honest, this series should've just been done after City of Glass. I feel like this book, or maybe even just the last half of this series in general, was just really unnecessary. The whole \"mortal instruments\" concept in which this whole series was named after, already seemed to reach its conclusion by the end of the third installment. But I'm just going to continue one with the last two books just to finally say I completed The Mortal Instruments, and to catch up on all of Cassandra Clare's Shadowhunter books in time for Lady Midnight. ...more ' \"And then there was you.

You came into my life and suddenly I had one truth to hold on to - that I loved you, and you loved me.\" Mortal Instruments: City of Fallen Angels is the fourth instalment in the franchise, written by Cassandra Clare, and follows City of Glass after the conclusive events. Ms Clare uses the repeated romance elements, dragged out plot and struggled to pick the perfect villain for the next three books. The Shadowhunters face new challenges, enemies and a completely different world from what they new. City of Glass finished the story off perfectly, so what the last three books truly necessarily? The Mortal Instruments books follow the adventures of Clary a teenaged girl from New York who discovers that a supernatural world exists and she is a part of it. Along the way it is revealed that her mother is a shadowhunter, her to-be step-father a werewolf and her best friend Simon gets turned into a vampire. Clary met Jace and fell instantly in love with him, only he turned out to be her long-lost brother \u2013 and then he wasn\u2019t \u2013 so their romance continues. It\u2019s safe to say there has been no shortage of excitement or drama in the series so far.\u00a0This book is obviously an attempt to revive a series that has already been concluded and resolved in order for the author and the publisher to make a predictable buck from Cassandra Claire's fans. I just wish the novel hadn't made that fact so obvious. Simon receives an offer from a vampire named Camille Belcourt who claims to have been usurped by Raphael Santiago. She says that if Simon joins her side as the Daylighter, then he will finally earn his place in the vampire society. After his meeting, he returns home worried about what his mother would think as she has been suspicious since he went to Idris in City of Glass and did not return for a few days. Although Magnus Bane erased memories of his absence, she was still subconsciously suspicious about his whereabouts. As Simon tries to adjust to life as a vampire, he is attacked a couple of times and each time the Mark of Cain curse works and the attackers are killed or flee in terror. Anyone who tries to attack him quickly meets with a biblical \"sevenfold\" death. After coming home after such an attack, his mother confronts him about the blood she has found hidden in his closet and he is forced to tell her what he has become. She believes that he is no longer her son and begins to pray. Desperate, he tells her that its a bad dream and she, surprisingly, believes him, with the help of his persuasion powers as a vampire. Knowing that he can't go back to his mother's house, he moves in with his band's new member, Jordan Kyle. When Jace comes to Simon's apartment, he meets Kyle, and realizes that Kyle is, in fact, a werewolf. Meanwhile, Jace has been having dreams in which he murders Clary by stabbing her or choking her which has led to stress between the two of them, leading Jace to avoid her. This of course, leads Clary to worry what is going on between them. Clary and her mother also discover that someone is trying to make more children like Jonathan, which again Jocelyn has trouble coming to terms with. At one of Simon's band's \"concerts\", Simon runs off stage ill from lack of blood consumption. Maureen, a fourteen-year-old and the band's only fan, follows Simon and asks for his picture. Halfway through taking it, Simon bites her and drinks her blood, and is thankfully interrupted by Kyle. At the concert, after the incident with Maureen, Simon is confronted by Maia and Isabelle. They are furious at him, as he never told either of them that he was dating both of them. Halfway through the argument, Kyle shows up. Before he can say anything, Maia recognizes him. It turns out that Jordan Kyle is actually Maia's ex-boyfriend who had turned her into a werewolf. She attacks him, only to be stopped by Simon and Isabelle. The day after that, they receive a message saying someone was holding Simon's girlfriend hostage and he should go save her. Calling up Clary, Isabelle, and Maia, Simon determines it's a joke, only to find that it was actually Maureen, who would always claim to be Simon's girlfriend at concerts, and had been kidnapped and killed when Simon did not show up to save her. Clary then goes to the Church of Talto only to find herself fighting a Hydra demon and was later helped out by Isabelle. Jace and Clary have an intimate moment in one of the spare rooms in the Institute. On, the point of taking the step in their relationship, Jace injures Clary with a knife. Disturbed by his recent nightmares, Jace breaks down and admits that he's been having nightmares and that was the reason why he was avoiding Clary. Clary then offers to take him to the Silent City to get help from the Silent Brothers. There, the Silent Brothers say that the nightmares Jace is having is due to his vulnerability to demonic influence, which occurred after Jace was resurrected by the Angel Raziel after Valentine had stabbed him. All Shadowhunters are subject to a ritual to protect them as infants. As Jace died, it was like he had been reborn without the protection. The Brothers want to perform the ritual again to give him the protection performed. Clary wants to stay with Jace, but the Silent Brothers say that she will be a distraction. Jace tells Clary that he will get better for her and Clary promises to see him very soon. Clary and Jace say their goodbyes and Clary leaves for the night. In his cell, Jace has a dream that he is back in Idris while realizing it's still a dream. Max appears to him and persuades him that the dreams are telling him that he is actually hurting Clary and his father (Stephen Herondale) is worried about him. He cuts his arms after Max convinces him that he will destroy the rotten part. With his blood, Max, who is actually the demon Lilith, draws a rune on his chest which allows him to be under Lilith's influence. Jocelyn and Luke, now engaged, attend an engagement party organized by Luke's werewolf pack, in which Simon disappears. Clary also disappears after being kidnapped by Jace to which no one else knows about yet. He has lied to Clary about leaving the Silent Brothers early. Jace tells Clary about a rune that binds them to one another forever. Clary accepts and hands him her stele. He begins to draws a rune, but Clary finds out too late that this is not the rune he told her about as she begins to lose consciousness with Jace catching her and carrying her away. Simon is led away from the party by Maureen, now a vampire, and is taken to Lilith, who has been alive since the beginning of time. She turned up at one of Simon's band's concerts and introduced herself as a prompter called Satrina. She explains that she needs him to resurrect Sebastian from the dead. When he tells her that he cannot bring the dead back to life, she tells him that he had had that power ever since he became a Daylighter. In order to persuade him to resurrect Sebastian, she possesses Jace and orders him to kidnap Clary. Jace brings Clary to Lilith and she orders him to kill her if Simon does not resurrect Sebastian. Simon reluctantly bites him and drains some of his blood; being poisoned in the process due to Sebastian's demon blood. Isabelle, Alec, Maia, and Jordan follow Simon using a business card they found in his wallet. When they get to the building, they check every floor until they find him. However, instead of finding Simon, they find the place that Lilith used as her nursery, with all the children dead. Everyone of them had clawed hands and black eyes, like that one Clary and her mom saw at the hospital. The babies were the outcome of Lilith trying to make half-demon children like Sebastian. While going through the room, Isabelle notices someone in the corner and attacks that person, and it turns out to be a mother of one of the babies who then explains to them what happened. Meanwhile, Clary tricks Jace by saying she does not wish to watch and he embraces her. She then grabs Jace's knife and cuts the rune that Lilith is using to possess him on his chest, causing Jace to be freed from Lilith's control. Jace tells Clary to run away, and believes that she did, but then Lilith reveals that Clary stayed and starts torturing her with a whip. Jace is upset and tells Lilith that he'll do what she wants if she lets Clary go, but Lilith wants and intends to torture Clary to madness. The third time that she goes to hit Clary, Simon kills Lilith by throwing himself between Lilith and Clary (The Mark of Cain). The Clave appears at the scene, and Isabelle tells them the story of what happened downstairs, while Jace is waiting for them upstairs. Jace and Clary share an intimate moment up on the roof. Jace is ashamed of his actions despite literally having no control over himself. Clary tells him that she loves him no matter what happens and the two share a kiss. She then goes down to the lobby to meet her mother, Luke, Simon, Maia, Alec, Magnus, and Isabelle, promising to come back in five minutes. It concludes with Jace's rune healing, hearing Sebastian's voice in his head, and with Sebastian/Jonathan now in control of Jace, Jace is forced to finish the awakening ritual on Sebastian, who is now wholly and fully alive. City of Fallen Angels was a mixture of disappoint and unnecessary, but proved its point, with certain elements of the plot. Personally, the ending for City of Glass was perfect; Valentine was defeated, Clary was with Jace, Alec was with Magnus, and they were looking at the firework. But no, it had to continue with a new villain and a new story. This new story includes new obstacles, trouble in paradise and recycled plots. As much as I tried to enjoy it, the existence of this book stopped me. Of course, there were particular parts of book that I enjoyed, but ultimately, I have a love and hate relationship with this book. While reading it, my attention was never lost and it was interesting. The beginning with Simon and Isabelle had me hooked, and as the book moved forward, most characters were happy\u2026 but then some shit went down and it\u2019s time to write two more books after this one. Simon\u2019s plot plays a much more significant role than Clary\u2019s, and there\u2019s a reason so; it kept the book going. The mystery consisted of finding out who was the person attempting to murder Simon, which included Jace and a werewolf, Kyle Jordan. His interactions with the vampires was short but hilarious as Simon\u2019s humor and wittiness never disappeared. His plot of the book had my attention, and I was looking forward to reading more about it. Additionally, I loved the moments with his mother, who didn\u2019t accept him. The Shadowhunter world has made it seem as if all parents will accept their children turning into a \u2018mythical\u2019 creature, but this mother didn\u2019t, which was a great twist to the story. Simon\u2019s develops a friendship with Jace, which readers have anticipated for since the first book. I enjoyed their banter, and the completely normal grocery shopping scene. Jordan\u2019s part was also great, as he story was revealed and the reason for why he helped Simon. It was revealed he was Maia\u2019s ex-boyfriend, the one who turned her. The Shadowhunter, the vampire and the werewolf makes a great, hilarious trio and bought laughs into the book. However, Simon had no drive, and no real goals except for his constant whining about being a vampire. I was even more annoyed with him because of his continual immoral and irresponsible behavior in this book. He kept causing himself trouble by being inconsiderate and stupid. I also thought that he could have been used more as some sort of fighting character. He's practically invincible, and yet he never really fights in the book. He stands there while others try to hurt him and fail, but saves Clary at the end of the day. \"What's this?\" \"That's a mango.\" Simon stared at Jace. Sometimes it really is like Shadowhunters were from an alien planet. \"I don't think I've seen one of those that wasn't already cut up,\" Jace mused. \"I like mangoes.\" Simon grabbed the mango and tossed it into the cart. \"Great. What else do you like?\" Jace pondered for a moment. \"Tomato soup,\" he said finally. \"Tomato soup? You want tomato soup and a mango for dinner?\" Jace shrugged. \"I don't really care about food.\" However, as this book focused on two plots, Clary\u2019s and Simon\u2019s, it also felt dragged out and too long. The romance between Clary and Jace was a desperate attempt to add love, heartbreak and fighting. Since the first book, I have never sensed the strong connection between them. As the storyline evolved, I still haven\u2019t found it. There is always drama between them; a week before, everything is going great, they are happy, then Jace decides to be a bitch and Clary does the same. I don\u2019t get the fighting. He was possessed, but he was avoiding her for most of the book, and then he would kiss her. She admitted she missed him, but pushed him away. It\u2019s fucking confusing and annoying. 60% of them involved Clary whining about him not returning his calls and Jace repeatedly trying to convince her that he loves her, but can't be near her. Why can't this couple be left alone? I assumed at the end of the last book that they'd uncover some dark secret of their past, why Clary was the 'wrong person' to fall in love with. \"You don't get to decide,\" she said, \"where I go, or when.\" \"I know.\" His voice was ragged. \"I've always known that about you. I don't know why I had to fall in love with someone who's more stubborn than I am.\" Simon\u2019s romance with Isabelle was terrible. To me, it seemed Ms Clare continuously tried to make sure each character had a love interest; Jace with Clary, Alec with Magnus, Simon with Isabelle, Jocelyn with Luke, Maia to Kyle. Then, she would write irritating drama, which would consist of fighting, heartbreak, jealousy and emotional scenes. It was too much, and this included Simon and Isabelle. She didn\u2019t call them exclusive and admitted she was allowed to date other men, but when she found out about Simon and Maia, she gives him constant shit about it. All the romance, excluding Alec and Magnus, is the shittiest part of the book. I keep cringing, rolling my eyes and eventually, I develop a headache from the continuous fighting. \"And I would do it again. I love you, Jace Wayland-Herondale-Lightwood-whatever you want to call yourself. I don't care. I love you and I will always love you, and pretending it could be any other ways is just a waste of time.\" A never-ending cycle, which kept repeating itself. I don't mind if love is frustrating, but this was irritating to no end. The plot, however, did move forward, and thankfully, it wasn't neglected. I admire Simon's friendship with Clary, as it's highlighted throughout all of the books. Most young adult books neglect friendship once the protagonist falls in love, so it's great to see the focus and many scenes between them. I love their friendship, their support for each other and I'm thankful for that he is not a love interest anymore. Introducing Simon as a love interest, to create a love triangle, was terrible idea. Fortunately, it was forgotten after the second book and they have moved forward. Since the second book, I have strongly dislike Jace. He is not the bad boy that I would fall in love with at some point. He keeps getting worse, trying to act selfish and covers up his disgusting actions/behavior with the excuse of love. He uses Simon so he can sleep in the apartment, but continues to treat him like shit. But Jace had his moments. Readers love Jace because of his rude sarcastic exterior hiding a decent, angst filled, brooding guy. But at the end of City of Glass, he got his happy ending, and therefore had no more reason to be angst filled or guilty. Claire quickly tries to remedy this by attempting to bring back Jace's self-loathing and perception of unworthiness, but it feels forced and poorly motivated. It's not until late in the book that Jace's reasons for being filled with guilt and shame seem reasonable, but by then I was too annoyed by his earlier ridiculous guilt to feel better about it. I have praised Ms Clare\u2019s writing in my previous review, but its gotten boring, the same metaphors and expressions recycled. It kills the excitement and the action sequences, and is overall, extremely dull. During the point of views changes, it doesn\u2019t bring anything new or unique to the perspective of the narration, but uses the same old boring storytelling method. There was humor, but it was too much. Every conversation had to have a snarky remark, sarcastic comment or funny joke. Jace is known to the funny, sarcastic character, but even without him, there always had to be humor, and it was too much. City of Fallen Angels tried to be funny, and yes, it had its occasional moment, but the overuse of banter, puns, sarcasm and humor killed my laughter while reading it. \"You're just worried they'll hire a male instructor and he'll be hotter than you.\" Jace's eyebrows went up. \"Hotter than me?\" \"It could happen,\" Clary said, \"You know, theoretically.\" \"Theoretically the planet could suddenly crack in half, leaving me on one side and you on the other, forever and tragically parted, but I'm not worried about that either. Some things,\" Jace said, with his customary crooked smile, \"are just too unlikely to dwell upon.\" Many elements in the book were picked up and dropped quite suddenly. Things like Jocelyn and Luke's wedding, (did they even get to it, in the book? It's not clear) were brought up when Cassandra Clare needed to fill in empty space. The Seelie Queen's appearance was confusing and just didn't fit with the rest of the book. There are some clear cliffhangers that will be resolved in the next book I assume, but all they did here was slow down the plot. The last 100 pages, which was the confrontation with Lilith, was boring and action-packed. It was easily predictable, that Simon was eventually going to give up and that Jace would fight. Furthermore, it was obvious Sebastian was going to get resurrected, as he his role was to serve as the villain the next two books. The cliffhanger didn\u2019t make it any more exciting, but left me disappointed. The end of the book was the best part in my opinion. The action was decent, and the resolution well set up. But overall I was disappointed by City of Fallen Angels. I had to force myself to finish this book, as it was set up nicely, but the last 100 pages and ending was terrible, obviously leading to the next book. The romance ruined the book, as it was continuous cycle of fighting, unhappiness, heartbreak and passion. The villain was recycled in a desperate attempt to continue the story, that has unfortunately, already lost its plot, excitement and adventure. It was supposed to be a trilogy, which would have worked better for it, as City of Glass finished perfectly. City of Fallen Angels didn\u2019t bring anything new to the franchise but a poor continuation. \"So what was that all about?\" \"I think,\" Jace said, \"that she asked if she could touch my mango.\" \"She said that?\" Jace shrugged. \"Yeah, then she gave me her number.\" ...more Did Cassandra Clare mix up manuscripts and put the wrong characters in this book? I know it's far-fetched, but I'm trying to understand how else a bunch of funny, intriguing characters could turn into such whiny bores. Jace is brooding and unfunny, Clary is pissy and unfunny, Simon is depressed and unfunny, Isabelle is....just sort of there (oh, and unfunny), Alec is...wait, Alec isn't there for most of it. But when he is, he's immature and unfunny. Even Magnus is unfunny. Magnus! Let's try and Did Cassandra Clare mix up manuscripts and put the wrong characters in this book? I know it's far-fetched, but I'm trying to understand how else a bunch of funny, intriguing characters could turn into such whiny bores.

But when he is, he's immature and unfunny. Even Magnus is unfunny. Magnus! Let's try and tie this installment to the previous three. At the end of City of Glass we were treated to a rare bit of carefree camaraderie as everyone basked in the relaxation and jubilant relief that can only accompany thwarting the master plans of some psycho with delusions of apocalyptic grandeur. Clary and Jace learned they weren't brother and sister, so they could be together, Simon was a vampire and finally attracting some chicks, Magnus and Alec were getting closer and snugglier, blah, blah, blah, everyone was happy and satiated. It was almost post-coital in its relaxation and happy happy warm fuzzy glowiness. Sure there was that ominous bit from the faery queen, but who takes that bitch seriously, anyway? Given that ending, I had expected to skip into City of Fallen Angels relatively smoothly, with everyone joking around and being friends and loving not being dead and all. What I got instead was page after page of Simon...emoting. Oh, and carrying on two relationships at once. So unlike Simon it kinda made me mad. When we're finally taken to see Clary and Jace, their relationship has not progressed at all, but has, in fact, regressed . \" How is this possible?\" I asked myself, wondering if perhaps there were big chunks of story I was missing somewhere. I began questioning my own reading comprehension, thinking perhaps all those steamy scenes from previous books, the longing, the yearning, the nearly-having-sex Clary and Jace of the past was all in my imagination. Had I dreamed it all? *Sigh* It was not a good sign of things to come. But I love the Mortal Instruments series and I forged ahead, thinking perhaps things would get better. SURPRISE! They didn't. The story is limp. Dead fish limp. Erectile dysfunction limp. Jace flits about like a clinically depressed muppet while Clary simpers and cries her way through the book without ever once growing a spine and demanding to know what the fuck is going on. Simon is wandering around waxing poetic about the horrors of being a vampire who can walk around during the day, and about the horrible imposition of having not one, but two girlfriends. Really? Isabelle is present. Yes, that's it. She's there, she offers information, she gets mad at Simon. Isabelle in a nutshell. Alec and Magnus are off on vacation together and don't show up until later on in the book. Not like that mattered because as soon as they showed up, I was wishing they'd just remained MIA. Alec spends his scenes sulking over Magnus' romantic past up until the end where he's either fighting baddies or stupidly freeing them. Magnus...I can't even talk about it. What she did with the old Magnus I may never know. This should be considered a crime against humanity. I absolutely cannot stand it when characters in a book refuse to communicate with one another because I can tell it's a very lazy trick by the author to drag the story out. If you don't have enough material to write a full book, don't write one . Don't sit here shoving smoke up my ass and trying to sell me on this \"Well, they're not speaking because they're ashamed and hurting\" psychobabble we both know is complete and total horse shit. They're not talking about anything with anyone else because if they did , everything would get figured out and the book would be over in 50 pages instead of a few hundred. The characters in this book spent more time avoiding each other than they did doing anything else, and I was overcome with the desire to watch them all die slow, painful deaths. Here's how it went: Mope, mope, mope, whine, whine, whine, moody, moody....BAD GUYS! Fight scenes, cliffhanger, the end. The bad guys were lame so the fight scenes were lame, and the cliffhanger was infuriating. Sebastian? Really, Ms. Clare? Again? These were not the characters I've grown to love. This is not the writing that made me fall for the MI series. This is Cassandra Clare at what I truly hope is her worst. ...more I was a little apprehensive going into this book because I'd heard some people saying it was their least favorite in the series, but I ended up really enjoying it!

The reason? Well, evil is ultimately defeated, the Shadowhunters are happy, the Downworlders are happy, Clary and Jace are happy, so why bring ghosts from the past back to life? The book starts with the events immediately after the Mortal War. Clary is training hard to become a better Shadowhunter, while happily dating Jace; Simon is trying to hide from his family the fact that he is a vampire, while still leading a seemingly normal life, since he can still walk under sunlight. The Lightwoods are still grieving for Max, but other than that, everyone is perfectly fine and things are running smoothly. As I said: a normal as-happy-as-possible ending after three books. But then Clare decides that she wants to get more money out of her story, so Shadowhunters start being attacked out of the blue and Jace starts avoiding Clary (Twilight feelings, maybe?). Jace starts having nightmares and weird behavior, so people have not only to try to find out who is attacking and murdering shadow hunters, but also try to help him with his drama. And so 2/3 of the book runs through. More than three hundred pages of completely unnecessary drama until Clare gets as bored as the readers and decides to throw everybody into a building where they fight for Jace's life (which was being controlled by evil forces). As a result, we end up with an old friend coming back to life and another unnecessary book to read. ...more Pre-reading: I swear I don't know why. It's like it's calling me.

Inspired by Madeline's Abridged Shakespeare reviews. --------------------- Okay, you know what? That was not the end. There's one last thing I have to say before I let you leave. I now believe that Cassandra Clare is, in reality, only writing these books to deliver a message to us. A secret message. A message so secret it's hidden in these shitty books. I have not deciphered the code yet, but I'm guessing it has something to do with the terrible writing. Maybe if you take the first letter of every sentence that makes you want to puke, you'll have by the end of the series the exact locations of the Holy Grail. Uhu. That's what I'm telling myself to convince me that I have to finish this trainwreck of a series. Yeah.

City of Fallen Angels is full of pleasant and shocking twists and turns with some of my beloved characters, and with other previously mentioned TMI series characters. Cassie has a talent for making me invest so much of myself emotional with her characters. One moment I'm sighing over a scene between Jace and Clary or Magnus and Alec and the next I'm either fuming over something a character did or on the verge of tears at one of her gut wrenching scenes, and then laughing out loud at the next scene from Jace or Simon's snarky lines. What I love about Cassie's writing is she isn't afraid to make her characters suffer and in the process she leaves me feeling emotional vulnerable as I feel a connection to her characters. I've not read a series that has a such a large cast of characters were each one adds something unique to the story and each one is a character I've come to enjoy and care about, well for the most part as there's a few I'd like to go all shadowhunter on. Like the other books in the TMI series, City of Fallen Angels picks up not long after City of Glass ends. Cassie is able to refresh our memories of what happened at the end of City of Glass in a manner that doesn't feel like it's a huge summary of what happened, but just enough to see through the eyes of Jace, Clary and Simon how they were effected and why they're feeling the way they are. I loved that the story has a lot of Simon's point of view. Simon to me is a character who's grown a lot since the start of the series. Some of my favorite scenes of his are the fabulous snarky lines he and Jace say to one another. I really can't get enough of her characters and her stories. She adds just the right amount of romance (oh yes there's a few sizzling scenes with Jace and Clary), action, anguish, settle humor, character growth and plot twists that keep me completely engaged with her book, but at the same time leaving me wanting so much more at the end. Cassie blurs the lines of paranormal and reality perfectly. Her words come alive and make me feel like I'm here, apart of her world. Cassie is a phenomenal writer and is someone who makes me think as she takes me along for an enjoyable ride and always leaves me wanting more.... one more kiss between Jace and Clary, one more page of her story, one more scene so the book doesn't have to end. City of Fallen Angels is a fabulous edition to the TMI series. It's an exciting, enticing read that will suck you right back into her dark, twisted, dangerous shadowhunter world. City of Fallen Angels is definitely the darkest of the series so far, and now I am anxiously waiting to find out what happens next in COLS. That ending.... UGH! It's brilliant. I definitely recommend picking up this book today! It's a must have to for all TMI fans. ...more 4 STARS! \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 This isn't really a review because honestly, I'm barely coherent at this point.

One thing I will give Clare credit for is in CoB and it's two sequels, she could pace. (Even if there were moments of \"Wait a tick, how could Clary throw a knife with accuracy if she was a human like a week ago?\") Now, since most people have talked about the logic and character problems inherent in CoFA, I'll talk about pacing. For those unfamiliar with the concept, these graphs can help illustrate what pacing is. First off, there's the concept of peaks and valleys. A peak is a beat of action, while a valley is time where characters process said beat of action. Good pacing is a series of steadily rising peaks and valleys until you reach the climax, and then a falling action and resolution. A satisfying story has enough beats of action to keep the story going, along with enough beats of \"rest time\" for the reader to properly process the action. All of this is basic playwriting 101, but I find it applies to fiction as well. Now, unfortunately some people can forget the concept of peaks and valleys, and then you have two types that can split off from the peak/valley ideal. One is a story where it's almost all peaks and no valleys, and gives you no time to process the action or really connect to the characters, (since I find I connect most to the characters during quieter moments.) These stories can still be entertaining, but generally are as about as memorable as a Michael Bay movie. The other downside is one where it's all valleys and no peaks. This doesn't mean there has to be car chases and such, but Things Need To Happen in order to push the story along, like finding out your idiot sister just ran off with Mr. Wickham or something. But if you have people standing around talking with nothing happening, it's going to come off as pretty boring. If you have too much action or not enough action, you would have a graph that looks like this: Unfortunately for Ms. Clare, CoFA falls decidedly into the latter category. The majority of this book is people standing around and talking. And what's worse, it's people standing around and talking about their love lives. Now, I guess that's entertaining if that's what you're expecting. However, based on the three previous books I expected, I don't know, something to happen maybe? For me, the majority of the book went: Talk talk talk ANGST talk talk Dudes in Sweatsuits (wait what?) Talk ANGST ANGST talk HEY LOOK CLIMAX oh wait I'm over now. Which is a problem. I could overlook some of the more glaring issues in Ms. Clare's writing with a ripping good tale where Stuff Happens and Action Takes Place, but with most action being talking, it was not a good read for me. Especially the extended scenes of Jace/Clary woe. There's nothing worse for me to read than breaking up a couple for nothing more than the sake of extending the plot. It's why I stopped watching a few television shows once my favorite couple FINALLY got together (Hi Gossip Girl!), because I knew the show would find new and more annoying ways to keep them apart to keep the plot going. I don't mind breaking up a couple or keeping a couple apart if it makes sense to the larger plot, but when a plot seems made up entirely for the sake of breaking up said couple, I don't like that. It seems lazy to me. CoFA is like that in one giant book, with many excuses for all the power couples to fight with each other, and talk about fighting with each other, and angsting about each other, and so on. By the time Lilith showed up I'd pretty much checked out. Had there been more action to break up all the angsting, I might have kept up with it and been more forgiving. But since pretty much what this book did was bore me, I'm afraid I'm going to have to give it a single star and check out of the rest of the series. ...more COFAteasers (provided by Cassandra Clare here ) These are the teasers that I have Twittered so far starting January of this year.

This is the LAST TEASER. Jace and Clary, midbook. The alley and the music all fell away, and there was nothing but her COFAteasers (provided by Cassandra Clare here ) These are the teasers that I have Twittered so far starting January of this year.

And you can even find wallpapers of the teasers here. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ December Teaser: December teaser for City of Fallen Angels. This is the LAST TEASER. Jace and Clary, midbook. The alley and the music all fell away, and there was nothing but her and the rain and Jace, his hands on her. . . He made a noise of surprise, low in his throat, and dug his fingers into the thin fabric of her tights. Not unexpectedly, they ripped, and his wet fingers were suddenly on the bare skin of her legs. Not to be outdone, Clary slid her hands under the hem of his soaked shirt, and let her fingers explore what was underneath: the tight, hot skin over his ribs, the ridges of his abdomen, the scars on his back. This was uncharted territory for her, but it seemed to be driving him crazy: he was moaning softly against her mouth, kissing her harder and harder, as if it would never be enough, not quite enough \u2014 Does it end there? Well, the scene doesn\u2019t but the teaser does. That\u2019s why they call \u2018em teasers. Have a happy holidays! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ November Teaser(s): Teaser 1) The Queen\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cYou told me that you did not wish to make a compact with me, for there was nothing I could give you. You said there was nothing in the world you wanted. When you imagine your life without him, do you still feel the same?\u201d *Why are you doing this to me?* Clary wanted to scream, but she said nothing, for the Faerie Queen glanced past her, and smiled, saying: \u201cWipe your tears, for he returns. It will do you no good for him to see you cry.\u201d Teaser 2) \u201cThat wasn\u2019t fair,\u201d Simon said. \u201cMaybe,\u201d said Isabelle. \u201cBut I watch my brothers give their hearts away and I think, Don\u2019t you know? Hearts are breakable. And I think even when you heal, you\u2019re never what you were before.\u201d ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Halloween Special: Clockwork Prince teaser: From mid-book: Will looked at Jem. His eyes were bluer than blue, his cheeks flushed. He said, \u201cThen you have wasted your time.\u201d Jem stared back at him. \u201cGod damn you,\u201d he said, and hit Will across the face, sending him spinning. He didn\u2019t lose his footing, but fetched up against the side of the carriage, his hand to his cheek. His mouth was bleeding. He looked at Jem with total astonishment. \u201cGet him into the carriage,\u201d Jem said to Tessa, and turned and went back through the red door \u2014 to pay for whatever Will had taken, Tessa thought. Will was still staring after him. \u201cJames?\u201d he said. *** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ October: 2010: Alec/Magnus with a mini-teaser about Clary/Jace. 1) \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d Alec, his head bent, was playing with an abandoned plastic fork. Though his eyes were defiantly cast down, their pale blue color was visible even through his lowered eyelids, which were pale and fine as parchment. Magnus had always found humans more beautiful than any other creatures alive on the earth, and had often wondered why. Only a few years before dissolution, Camille had said. But it was mortality that made them what they were: the flame that blazed brighter for its flickering. He wondered if the Angel had ever considered making his human servants, the Nephilim, immortal. But no, for all their strength, they fell as humans had always fallen in battle through all the ages of the world. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that look again,\u201d Alec said peevishly, glancing up through his lashes. \u201cLike you\u2019re staring at something I can\u2019t see. Are you thinking about Camille?\u201d \u201cNot really,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cHow much of the conversation I had with her did you overhear?\u201d \u201cMost of it.\u201d Alec prodded the tablecloth with his fork. \u201cI was listening at the door. Enough.\u201d \u201cNot at all enough, I think.\u201d Magnus glared at the fork and it skidded out of Alec\u2019s grasp and across the table toward him. He slammed his hand down on top of it and said, \u201cStop fidgeting. What was it I said to Camille that bothered you so much?\u201d Alec raised his blue eyes. \u201cWho\u2019s Will?\u201d 2) Jace caught her hand in his. \u201cJust say it again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you,\u201d Clary said. \u201cNo matter what happens, what I do?\u201d *** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ September 2010 \u201cYou think you\u2019re a vampire,\u201d Simon\u2019s mother said, numbly. \u201cYou think you drink blood.\u201d \u201cI do drink blood,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI drink animal blood.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re a vegetarian.\u201d His mother looked to be on the verge of tears. \u201cI was. I\u2019m not now. I can\u2019t be. Blood is what I live on.\u201d Simon\u2019s throat felt tight. \u201cI\u2019ve never hurt anyone. I\u2019d never drink someone\u2019s blood. I\u2019m still the same person. I\u2019m still me.\u201d His mother seemed to be fighting for control. \u201cYour new friends \u2014 are they vampires, too?\u201d Simon thought of Isabelle, Maia, Jace. He couldn\u2019t explain Shadowhunters and werewolves, too. It was too much. \u201cNo. But \u2014 they know I am one.\u201d \u201cDid \u2014 did they give you drugs? Make you take something? Something that would make you hallucinate?\u201d \u201cNo. Mom, this is real.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou think it\u2019s real. Oh, God. Simon. I\u2019m so sorry. I should have noticed. We\u2019ll get you help. We\u2019ll find someone. A doctor. Whatever it costs \u2014\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t go to a doctor.\u201d \u201cYes, you can. You need to be somewhere. A hospital, maybe \u2014\u201d He held out his wrist to her. \u201cFeel my pulse,\u201d he said. She looked at him, bewildered. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cMy pulse,\u201d he said. \u201cTake it. If I have one, okay. I\u2019ll go to the hospital with you. If not, you have to believe me.\u201d She wiped the tears from her eyes and slowly reached to take his wrist. 2) [This teaser will make sense mainly to those who have read Clockwork Angel.] \u201cCamille,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d She smiled. Her skin looked whiter than he recalled, and dark spidery veins were beginning to show beneath its surface. Her hair was still the color of spun silver and her eyes were still green as a cat\u2019s. She was still beautiful. Looking at her, he was in London again. He saw the gaslight and smelled the smoke and dirt and horses, the metallic tang of fog, the flowers in Kew Gardens. He saw a boy with black hair and blue eyes like Alec\u2019s, heard violin music like the sound of silver water. He saw a girl with long brown hair and a serious face. In a world where everything went away from him eventually, she was one of the few remaining constants. And then there was Camille. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Magnus,\u201d she said. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ August 2010 Jocelyn\u2019s green eyes softened. \u201cI did notice Jace wasn\u2019t here, Clary. I just didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d want to talk about it.\u201d \u201cI mean,\u201d Clary went on doggedly, \u201cdo you think there\u2019s something Jace could do to *make* you like him?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Jocelyn said. \u201cHe could make you happy.\u201d She touched Clary\u2019s face lightly, and Clary clenched her hand, feeling the bell press into her skin. \u201cHe does make me happy,\u201d Clary said. \u201cBut he can\u2019t control everything in the world, Mom. Other things happen \u2014 \u201c she fumbled for words; how could she explain that it wasn\u2019t Jace making her unhappy, but what was happening to him, without revealing what that was? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ July 2010 Clary made a surprised noise, but didn\u2019t protest, even when Jace lifted her up and carried her over to the bed. They sprawled onto it together, crushing some of the letters, Jace knocking the box itself aside to make room for them. His heart was hammering against the inside of his ribs. They had never been in bed together like this before, not really \u2014 there had been that night in her room in Idris, but they had barely touched. Jocelyn was careful never to let either of them spend the night where the other one lived. She didn\u2019t care much for him, Jace suspected, and he could hardly blame her. He doubted her would have liked himself much, in her position. \u201cI love you,\u201d Clary whispered. She had his shirt off, and her fingertips were tracing the scars on his back, and the star-shaped scar on his shoulder than was the twin of her own, a relic of the angel whose blood they both shared. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to lose you.\u201d He slid his hand down her cheek, to her throat, to the top button of her blouse. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ June 2010 \u201cThere is something you have not told us, Clarissa Morgenstern,\u201d said the Silent Brother. \u201cA secret you both have been keeping.\u201d Clary tensed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The mark of death is on this boy.\u201d \u201cDeath?\u201d said Jace. His voice was modulated, careful, not afraid. \u201cDo you mean I\u2019m going to die?\u201d We mean that you *were* dead. And yet you live. The balance of life and death is a delicate one, young Shadowhunters. You have upset it.\u201d ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ May 2010 \u201cBut I thought that you were still in love with Clary,\u201d Isabelle said. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ April 2010 \u201cHow many other people?\u201d Alec asked. \u201cRoughly.\u201d Magnus shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t count and it doesn\u2019t matter. The only thing that matters is how I feel about you.\u201d \u201cMore than two hundred?\u201d Magnus looked blank. \u201cThree hundred?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re just having this conversation now,\u201d Magnus said, to no one in particular. \u201cWhy so many?\u201d Alec\u2019s blue eyes were very bright in the dimness. It was hard to tell if he was angry \u2014 he didn\u2019t sound angry, just very intense, but Alec was a shut-down person and perhaps this was as angry as he ever got. \u201cDo you get bored with people fast?\u201d \u201cI live forever,\u201d Magnus said quietly. \u201cBut not everyone does.\u201d ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ March 2010 Magnus still had his head in his hand.\u201di just don\u2019t see,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy the past has to matter.\u201d ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ February 2010 \u201c\u2018That\u2019s not the point, Simon.\u2019 Maia had moved closer to Isabelle and the two of them faced him down together, an immovable wall of female rage.\u201d ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ January 2010 \u201cHe is bound to you,\u201d said the Queen. \u201cBut does he love you?\u201d ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ...more", "Title": "City of Fallen Angels"},
