Leaving aside the cliched plot and all the other things that people have pointed out, I have something of a taste for children's and young adult fantasy stories. I'm a total geek for Harry Potter, and quite enjoyed Fablehaven, Tithe, and Wicked Lovely, amongst others. The thing is there are some children's books which, while written young, can appeal to an older audience, and there are others which are written in such a way as to make the cross-over nigh impossible. This was on of the latter... Leaving aside the cliched plot and all the other things that people have pointed out, there were two things which annoyed me the most about the book and both of which have to do with tone. For one, I felt that the author was writing in the way that some adults speak to younger children - not as young people, but as idiots. I felt it was written more for 6 year old than a 9-12 year old - and can only wonder if I would've been offended while reading this at 12 since the tone, to me, felt so patronizing. The other annoying thing was the way that the \"<+++>Magyk</+++>al\" words were capitalized and bolded. It's another one of those things that makes me feel like the author thinks children are idiots - let's make sure they don't miss this special , important words! Look at this word over here! Don't miss it now, boys and girls! That's right! It's a <+++>Magyk</+++> word! (spoken in the tones of nauseatingly bad children's theater everywhere... ) It would be an exquisite torture finishing this series. Luckily for me, I'm not nearly that masochistic... ...more This was pretty good. A nice, quick, easy read that kept me entertained. I especially enjoyed the whimsical tone throughout. I would have liked to see a bit more emotional depth and moral ambiguity from the characters though. This book doesn't really \"go there.\" Also a tad long for middle grade. Still, a good read, especially for kids, I'm sure. Long, entertaining, with some humorous lines, and nice chapter illustrations. (British version.) More Harry Potter similarities. I didn\u2019t mind the postscript with what happened to the minor characters. And the prose was certainly better than Paolini\u2019s first book (I somehow can\u2019t force myself to read the second one), and the plot was a lot fresher, too. But there were some negatives as well: too many characters, without a focal character!

And you\u2019re in the head of way too many adult characters, not to mention the guard bugs (which admittedly were funny, but I don\u2019t think I really needed their thought processes in such detail). Another problem was that new characters showed up in every chapter, resulting in more distractions from forming a bond with the main character (whoever that was supposed to be). ...more REVIEW: MAGYK by <---A>Angie Sage</---A> I have just read and enjoyed \u2018Magyk\u2019 by Angie Sage.

Comparisons are unavoidable, and reading this story in the shadow of Rowling's legacy makes it difficult to properly evaluate the characters and plot without drawing mental links between Boggart and Hagrid, DomDaniel and Voldemort, that leave an adult reader feeling dissatisfied with the world of Magyk.

Comparisons are unavoidable, and reading this story in the shadow of Rowling's legacy makes it difficult to properly evaluate the characters and plot without drawing mental links between Boggart and Hagrid, DomDaniel and Voldemort, that leave an adult reader feeling dissatisfied with the world of Magyk. It is, however, important to keep in mind that this IS a different book, with different strengths and weaknesses. It is written for a younger audience than HP: many scary parts are played down or narrated from the perspective of an historic event. There's less suspense and many breaks for play and mundane activities that slow the forward momentum enough to let small children relax after a scary chase or a bad turn of events. There are many nods to classic children's fiction, including things that made me groan in pain, such as the Heaps' address at \"There and Back Again Row\" (Grrraauugggghhh! Tolkien is rolling in his grave). If you like Edith Nesbit or Enid Blyton you'll see a lot of their influence. The first 150 pages were not to my taste. I struggled through them, but found the last half of the book picked up and caught my interest. Sage's strength lies in her love of boating and wet places. Once the focus of the story moves away from the castle and into the marshes, the author relaxes into her own world of old British coastal ways that don't feature strongly in Rowling's franchise - the salty ways of sailors and bogs, mists and mud, bad cooking and swamp creatures. Several technical aspects of the book annoyed me no end. I found the use of a special, bolded font for all Magykal words to be deeply irritating. I did not enjoy the mish-mash of different verb tenses, narrative voices and points of view, particularly the heavy use of flashbacks. I must also complain about the many, many convenient interventions by previously unknown devices that saved the day for our young adventurers. Deus ex Machina is everywhere. Being attacked by a scary wizard in a deadly boat? Not to worry, here's a secret boat you never knew you had! Being hunted by a man who is going to set you on fire? Not to worry, just use the magic anti-death charm someone gave you last week! If Horace had been the editor on hand for the first read-through of this script, it would still be languishing on the bottom of the slush pile. To conclude, this book is a fun read... for little kids. It is NOT one of the hot new Young Adult crossovers that get printed with a second, Adult version of the cover. As a thirty-something, I can say that while I could enjoy reading this story aloud to an 8- to 10-year-old, it was too young for me to enjoy on my own. ...more www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com I read this book many, many moons ago!

They take a precarious trip to their Aunt Zelda in the swamps. It's such a fun book with all of the little magical things like the Shield Bugs, they are so cool and I want a group of them of my own! My favorite was Jenna's pet rock that she named Petroc Trelawney! I want one, actually I have some rocks around here I intend to paint different colors with little faces. I doubt they will come to life it I pet them though :( I love their Boggart friend too. There are just so many things to like about this book. They have to face a bunch of junk trying to keep away from the bad guys that just want to get Jenna back. They find out some things they never knew. They learn spells and mostly have a good time.

It took me a few more chapters than I would have liked to \"get into\" the story and the characters, but after a while I found that I did feel invested. I liked the distinct personalities of the characters, and how consistent they seemed to be. It also took a while to understand the magical world.

Two parts to this: one, being the good vs. evil statuses and people, how things came about, and what it all meant. I still feel there is more to it all though, and perhaps these areas will be explored in the later books. Enough came across, however, for the story to unfold as it should have. The second part is how magic works in Septimus Heap's world. I think I got a pretty good understanding by the middle of the book though, so again, it didn't bother me too much. (I still can't decide if the bolding of every magical word was cool or annoying). All in all I thought the book was written pretty well, and the plot flow was good. It's told from multiple perspectives, which makes for a bit jumpy read sometimes, but pretty much the transitions are smooth. The ending was satisfying, and good. Though a few things were left unresolved, I'm assuming it's for the following books. Hopefully. There were some things that very young children, or very sensitive children, might be upset about (mainly relating to cute woodland creatures who... we're not entirely sure what their fates end up being). But overall it's a very \"G\" read (or maybe PG). There is one part at the end that's pretty unsettling, but the fact it's rectified makes it less so. A few character traits were somewhat irksome, but again, I'm hoping that the author delves into these in the next books (this book did a good job, so I'm trusting that the author will continue in a similar fashion). Some things were predictable, but others surprising. And at the end of the book is an interesting collection of \"whatever happened to\" certain characters, \"instructions\" for various charms, etc. I'd recommend this book to fans of other \"young adult\" fantasy, and while I'm not as in love with the book as certain others in this genre, I did find it a very fun read! ...more Amazingly good written.

This is what I called overly-creative dumb ass. And using bold in some words (e.g Magyk word) totally treat the reader like a total retard. I totally don't get the point! It's totally pissing me off for the fact that this book get so much praise. Enough said. Magyk - book one of the Septimus Heap series by Angie Sage - conjured up a certain expectation in my mind before I started reading it: that of a young wizard in a medieval setting who has to fight against some other evil wizard. That's about as much as the blurb on my edition gives away.

That's about as much as the blurb on my edition gives away. So, I'm guessing new readers could be very surprised to find out that baby Septimus Heap 'dies' in the first few pages, and is instantly replaced by an orphaned baby girl that the patriarch of the Heap family, Silas, found laid out in the snow. In the castle town that the Heap family call home, the Queen has been assassinated, and her newborn daughter has gone missing, leaving a vacuum of power in the castle. This is quickly filled by the Supreme Custodian, who rules in a rather more draconian fashion. Knowing that the princess may still be alive, he sends out regular squads to find her, and only just gets lucky when it turns out that ten year old Jenna Heap is really the missing princess. Fleeing the town late at night with the ExtraOrdinary wizard Marcia and narrowly escaping a hunter, the Heap family (plus one child soldier) go their separate ways to avoid danger. And from then on, this book is a whole load of fun. From a crazy aunt who keeps a cat-turned-duck and is friends with a swamp-dwelling Boggart, to a specialised network of messenger rats, to a dragon boat, and cases of mistaken identity mixed with missing princesses and seventh sons of seventh sons, this book was sheer joy to read. Incredibly imaginative and enjoyable, in fact. So why has it been demoted down one star? Unfortunately, there are parts where the plot becomes kind of static, focusing only on developments with the kids at the house in the marsh. I didn't know anything about what DomDaniel was plotting, Stanley's ordeal in prison, the Supreme Custodian's role in ruling the Castle and its town, Sarah and the other boys running through the forest, and what about that poor woman whose pub was burned down by the Hunter and his gang? Some things are explained in the story, yes, and amusingly enough there's a section at the back of the novel that covers the unseen events of all the aforementioned characters (and some other background characters, like the baby-snatching midwife who's responsible for the mix-up with Septimus), but I would have been much happier if this information had been weaved into the general narrative rather than a tacked-on addendum. 4/5. ...more \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0645\u0642\u0628\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u0639\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0644\u0641\u0629 \u0641\u0649 \u0641\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0644 :- \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u062a\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0635\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u0649 270 \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0629 :- \u0641\u0647\u0649 \u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u062a\u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u062f \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0623\u062f\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0646\u064a\u0646 17 \u0648 19 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0628\u0623\u062f\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0634\u0626\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0648\u064a\u0646 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0641\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0628\u0648\u062a\u0631 Reviewed by Me for TeensReadToo.com If you've been looking for a series that combines the magic of Harry Potter with the imaginative characters of Artemis Fowl, then Septimus Heap and his first book, MAGYK, is definitely the story for you.

A quick, delightful read that can stand on its own, MAGYK is, without a doubt, an intriguing page-turner. Septimus Heap, the seventh son of a seventh son, died shortly after birth. Born to a family of Wizards, there's no telling what he might have become, as his lineage as a seventh son would have made him unbelievably magical. But on that winter night when Septimus died, his father, Silas, found another newborn child in the forest. They named her Jenna, and she grew up thinking that she was the daughter of Silas and Sarah Heap, and the sister of six older brothers--Simon, Sam, Edd, Erik, Nicko, and Jo-Jo. Early on, though, Sarah had her own ideas of who Jenna really was, especially when she heard the news that the Queen had been murdered. Jenna Heap was, undoubtedly, the Princess. Over the next ten years, darkness came to the Castle and the Ramblings, where the Heaps lived. With no Queen, evil came in the form of the Supreme Custodian, who along with his cohorts banned magic and ended the happiness the Queen's people had once known. As the Heap family attempt to ride out this time of darkness, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, learns of the plot to kill the Princess, which will allow evil to truly take over the Palace. It seems that the only thing keeping DomDaniel, the Dark Wizard, from returning to the Castle is the presence of the Princess, and he plans to remedy that. What follows is the flight of Jenna, Nicko, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, and a Young Army recruit known only as Boy 412 to the Marram Marshes, where Aunt Zelda Heap, a White Witch, will be able to keep them from harm. As events unfold and DomDaniel does everything within his power to track down the girl standing between him and a ruling darkness, the Heap family will have to do everything within their means to stop him--and at the same time stay alive. MAGYK is a delightful, entertaining story filled with action-adventure and fantasy. With a very large cast of characters who are as diverse as they come, this is one story not to be missed. If you like Harry Potter, you will definitely enjoy Septimus Heap. Filled with twists and turns, this is a story you'll stay up reading long into the night. And although at times predictable, you'll quickly be drawn into the life and times of the Heap family and their magical world. ...more I picked up this books mainly on the aesthetic value the cover had.

Not even a quarter a way into the book and you'll have already found out who Septimus is (suprise, suprise.) Third, is that the authors writing isn't captivating at all. No where in the book have I felt the need to go on reading. The only reason I continued until the end was because I don't like the idea of leaving a book unfinished (except for Twilight because that book was too horrible to continue.) Fourth, I hate the creatures Sage created/portrayed. This is pretty much personal preference. I hate rats, seals, and bugs. Just so happens, this book contains all three. I absolutely hate how the Boggart was described. But then, that's probably only because I had something to compare her description with (The Last Apprentice's boggarts are my favorite.) Fifth, the story itself is kind of... meh. It wasn't worth reading 500+ pages for. If you want to get into some serious reading with captivating characters, impressive story line, magical (not magykal )creatures, and grand adventures... this is definitely not the book for you. But if you're looking for a time waster while you're waiting for your next appointment, I guess this book will do the trick. I wouldn't consider myself a fast reader, I pretty much read on a normal speed. This book though, took me much much longer to finish than usual.(3 weeks) I kept putting it off.

While I wouldn\u2019t jump to read every book in the series in I have been trying to drag myself through this book for the past few days and, if nothing changes, plan to give up within the next 25 pages.

While I wouldn\u2019t jump to read every book in the series in its correct order, I\u2019d definitely recommend them to parents or pick one up off the shelf for a short, sweet read. Though the writing is a little clich\u00e9d at times, and the plot is simple, I can chalk it up to being a kids\u2019 book, enjoy it for what it is, and move on. Not so with this one. One thing that bugged me right off the bat was that this book was compared to Harry Potter. I hate that. I always have, and I always will. HP holds a very, very special place in my heart, but I always try to judge books on their own merit, rather than comparing them to others (unless the similarities are really blinding). Comparing this series to HP does it no favors whatsoever. I realize this is the publishing company\u2019s fault and nothing to do with the book or the author herself. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019. Stop it. Next on the docket: the \u2018Magyeicale\u2019 words being bolded. At first I thought this was because I had an online version from the library, so I was willing to let it go, but no more. I\u2019m fairly sure kids would recognize that the spell/act/concept is magical without the misspelling and formatting; they are children, not mentally deficient lemmings. These irritations, however, pale in comparison to Sage\u2019s writing itself, which really does seem to be aimed at a target audience of mentally deficient lemmings. What. The. Fudge. Example: Roughly a page in, we are told how Silas Heap finds a baby in the snow, smuggles her in through the city gates, and is accosted by the new Grand High Poobah, who warns him to raise the child as his own. He does so. Roughly 20 pages later, GHP sweeps back into Silas\u2019 life to take the baby back. Silas, apparently in the strong hope that GHP has magyeicalley forgotten that she gave him the baby, in essence says, \u201cWhat the fudge, woman? This black-haired, violet-eyed child is the very fruit of my and my wife\u2019s blond, green-eyed loins. She is the bosom sister of my six blond, green-eyed male children. You cannot tear them asunder!\u201d To which GHP replies, \u201cRemember that time when you found a baby in the snow, smuggled her in through the city gates, and saw me, and I warned you to raise her as your own?\u201d \u201dOh yeah! Was really hoping you wouldn\u2019t remember, tbh.\u201d By this point, even the lemmings might scoff. I? I will read 25 more pages because I love books and want to grant each one of them equal opportunity to win my heart. (Even the insufferably stupid ones.) ...more 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this, it was such a fun read. classic example of choosing a book based on its prominent display location. I saw it was a series, sounded interesting, so I got it. While only begun, it is a fun read so far. and now, the verdict is, in the words of Simpson's everywhere: Meh. mildly entertaining, annoying bold, italic , misspelled wordes . The story is ok, but nothing gripping. I actually left it for weeks with only a few pages at the end. While it wasn't a \"bad\" book, per se, it isn't one I can recommend at all. Overall, this book was a little disappointing. It was simply alright. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't that into it either. I was certainly right when I said this would be a light read. It was VERY light. The book just seemed a little undeveloped. It was like it COULD have been great, but it just wasn't. It had the potential, but it was just undeveloped and thin. Maybe it's because this book is clearly for a younger audience, maybe I'm reading this way too late, maybe I would've really liked it if I Overall, this book was a little disappointing.

Maybe it's because this book is clearly for a younger audience, maybe I'm reading this way too late, maybe I would've really liked it if I had've read it when I was younger, but oh well too late now. Besides I have read some books quite recently that have been for younger audiences, and they were better and a lot more engaging than this. I'm not saying this book was terrible, the story was quite good, however the world just seemed very undeveloped and it just felt 'meh' reading it the whole time. Pretty much all of the characters had like no depth. The only characters I found mildly interesting were Boy 412, the Apprentice and Simon towards the end. Even the villain DomDaniel (what kind of name is that?!) was crappy. There wasn't much to the plot and admittedly a fair bit of the story was just cliche. And seriously mostly takes place in like, one place, it was just slightly boring. Magyk had its interesting and unique little parts, and the ending was good I will say that (even though it was incredibly predictable) but overall it just alright. It seemed like the whole time the book was trying so hard, but it just wasn't engaging me. A shame too this series looked pretty cool. The heap of capitalised words annoyed me, seriously words like Caused, Removed, there were so many on EVERY page. It just got annoying. Again maybe I would have liked it better if I had read it when I was younger, but oh well. This book didn't impress. I'm glad I didn't pay for it at least. SPOILERS As I said before, pretty much all the characters were just bland and had no depth. I honestly didn't care for the majority of them. Jenna was alright, but she was just shallow, it just felt there was nothing to her besides her being the lost Princess or Queenling or whatever. I just didn't connect with her. I wanted to like Silas but he turned out to just be boring. Marcia was alright but she was a little annoying sometimes and at times I didn't like her, again she just had no depth. Nicko was alright but again no depth whatsoever. All these characters just felt so undeveloped. Honestly they were just there. Boy 412 was the only character who was good and actually had some depth, but that's probably only because he ends up being the main character of the entire series anyway. DomDaniel was an extremely lame villain, he was not threatening at all and seriously he did pretty much nothing. All the bad guys were stupid in fact, I hate when characters that are supposed to be evil just end up being completely unthreatening and stupid idiots, it's unrealistic and makes for a less enjoyable story. Everyone loves cool and awesome villains who are actually challenging. The Apprentice was an alright character, he's one I wanted to know more about. And Simon seemed like a deeper character, he turned a lot more interesting towards the end. Aunt Zelda, it felt like she was just there because she needed to be. The characters were just boring. Characters mean a lot to me in books, and they just need a lot more development then that. Yet again, maybe it's just because this book is for a younger audience - maybe younger than I thought - but still, I think it could have been better. By the way, Boy 412 being Septimus Heap. Wow such a surprise... (Sarcasm) That was SOOO predictable. If you're trying to make it a surprise at least make it a little less obvious, like not making the Apprentice so poor at magyk or making it so obvious that Boy 412 had awesome magical talent. Seriously I guessed it like a quarter of the way through the book. The story was just cliche. And seriously, the main character of a book should be introduced properly for the majority of the story, this just felt weird to be honest. It feels like the whole book is just setup, and then the actual story begins at the end when you find out who Septimus is. It's weird. Magyk ends really abruptly too. It's like; well what happens? Do they go back? What happens to Jenna does she become the princess or what? I also want to know what happened to DomDaniel's Apprentice. Apparently Aunt Zelda brought him back to life but what happened afterward? Seriously the only interesting characters were Boy 412, or Septimus, the Apprentice (who you find out to be Merrin at the end) and Simon, the oldest Heap son. In fact Simon seems much deeper, he gets very interesting towards the end. In that prologue of the second book, that was real interesting. Seriously the peek you got at the next book was more interesting than most of this book. It looks like Simon is gonna turn evil, I kind of want to see what happens there. Spoilers end. Anyway this book wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. It was just undeveloped and wasn't engaging enough. There wasn't much to the plot, it was uneventful and simple, the characters were mostly boring and had no depth, and the setting just felt undeveloped. And there were a few silly thing in my opinion like Messenger Rats that could speak and all this stuff about ghosts (cough Harry Potter thoughts). The writing style was also fairly plain, I get that this book is for a younger audience, but I've read many books for younger audiences that have been a lot better. Seriously the little peek you got at the next book - the prologue and chapter 1 - was more interesting than most of this book. I definitely won't be continuing this series I think, but I kinda want to pick up book 2 just to see what happens there after that prologue especially. Or I might just look it up. Either way it's a shame, this series looked pretty cool, but this book kinda disappointed. I didn't love it. Magyk gets a 6/10. It wasn't terrible, it was alright. The book just didn't feel developed enough, and I guess I shouldn't be reading something written for such a young audience. Even so the story was just mediocre, in my opinion the plot was too uneventful. Even though I might have a peek at the second book, I definitely won't be continuing this series.

The most interesting thing for me was that this book is very much like a prequel book that the author doesn\u2019t think about until after they\u2019ve written the rest of the series but it was in fact the first book in the series. And Septimus Heap who I suspect will be the main charac This book was an interesting and unexpected read, I picked it up yesterday in Waterstones and started it in the car on the way home but then found myself unable to put it down and finished reading it in less than 24 hours. The most interesting thing for me was that this book is very much like a prequel book that the author doesn\u2019t think about until after they\u2019ve written the rest of the series but it was in fact the first book in the series. And Septimus Heap who I suspect will be the main character in the rest of the series isn\u2019t actually known until the very last chapter. In this book there is no main character as such since it is a book with alternating POV\u2019s but a family and group of friends who all contribute to being both main and secondary characters. So with this in mind the most noteworthy characters to me are (and there are a few); Jenna, Nicko, Boy 412, Marcia, Silas, Sarah and Zelda. Jenna is the child adopted by the Heap family at the start of the book after Silas finds her in the snow and learns of the death of his son; Jenna is raised as one of the family and only learns her true identity later on in the book. Nicko is one of the sons in the family and forgive me for not knowing the order but there are 6 of them; he is adventurous and brazen running head first into battles he cannot possibly know the scope of. Boy 412 is a character adopted by the main group and who doesn\u2019t really fully join them until later on in the book; after being raised in the \u2018child army\u2019 he only identifies by his rank and number and doesn\u2019t talk other than to say this. Marci is the \u2018Extra-ordinary\u2019 witch of the group; after finishing her training she achieved this rank and tries to hold it over everyone\u2019s head thinking it makes her better than the others. Silas is the father, an ordinary wizard who dropped out of training after the birth of his sons in order to help his wife care for them. Sarah is the mother; she tries to help her children and their father in this book but ultimately struggles as they continually get away from her. The storyline is original and gripping with very likeable characters and a building sense of danger that will most probably be explored in the rest of the series. The pacing was great leading the reader on a gripping adventure all the way through and still holding back a surprise until the very last minute. 5 stars a great will and this will be a series I will continue with through to the end. ...more Magyk wasn't BAD, necessarily, it just really pales in comparison to so many other fantasy stories I've read. My main problem with it was the complete lack of a central main character. The series title, Septimus Heap, is supposed to be that main character. However, he doesn't, technically, show up until really late in the book. Before that we jump between SO many different characters: Jenna, Silas, Marcia, Nicko, bad guys, good guys, and even boggarts, mice and a wolf. I mean those animal na Magyk wasn't BAD, necessarily, it just really pales in comparison to so many other fantasy stories I've read.

However, he doesn't, technically, show up until really late in the book. Before that we jump between SO many different characters: Jenna, Silas, Marcia, Nicko, bad guys, good guys, and even boggarts, mice and a wolf. I mean those animal narrations are pretty funny, but it felt really unnecessary to me. And not having a central character to direct it all, it just felt way to jumbled. Add the fact that you meet a new character almost every chapter, introducing new viewpoints, personalities and opinions; I just starting not caring. I was never confused, persay, it IS a kid's book. It just felt like the author knew about her serious problem (aka lack of a hero), so she tried to throw in all these \"crazy\" characters to make up for it. Story wise, it's just mediocre. Something about a seventh son of a seventh son born to take down the evil DomDaniel. It's not groundbreaking, we've all seen this before. That would have been fine, if I would have cared for the characters. And previously mentioned character problems really prevented that from happening Reading on my nook, I was confused when I would happen across a word like, \"Flyte\" and it would be capitalized. I then found out in the actual book, those words are also bolded to show emphasis on Magykal spells and whatnot. The capitalization annoyed me, I couldn't even imagine the bolding. It's exactly the same problem I had with Chuck Palahniuk's Tell All. I don't need you to point out something obvious to me, I'm not an idiot. And I don't even see how it helps kids, yeah you can put spells in bold and make them jump out at the reader, but what's the point? If you're reading the book you already know what the spells are, there's no need for it. I guess it just comes down to feeling like I was talked down to at times, and I don't enjoy that at all. In the end, a cliched plot, kiddie characters, and a hilariously obvious twist all mean one thing: my Magykal *gag* journey ends here. ...more I finished reading this a long time ago but I kept forgetting to write the review, even though I'm 2/3 of the way through the second book already, so I apologize for not having many details in this review. But this jist of it is that this book was just fantastic. It started off a little bit slow and I was a bit concerned, it was a little bit confusing to understand why I was hearing a story about a family and a little girl when the book title seemed to be about a kid named Septimus Heap, but it I finished reading this a long time ago but I kept forgetting to write the review, even though I'm 2/3 of the way through the second book already, so I apologize for not having many details in this review. But this jist of it is that this book was just fantastic. It started off a little bit slow and I was a bit concerned, it was a little bit confusing to understand why I was hearing a story about a family and a little girl when the book title seemed to be about a kid named Septimus Heap, but it soon picked up and became lots of fun, charming, funny, sweet, and just all-around well-done. The author is so witty, I found myself laughing out loud so many times as I was listening to this book. Of course it helped that the narrator, Allan Corduner, was one of the best I've ever heard. He made each character unique and I loved his voice from the very first word of the book. He added so much to the story and I'm so disappointed that he only read this one, not using him for the rest of the books is a real loss. He's as good as Jim Dale or any of the other great narrators, it's such a shame. Anyway, back to the book, the author wrote such charming characters and so many witty and funny little lines, she just kept hitting it out of the park over and over again. It was just right , the way I hope a book will be but most aren't quite there. Of course, I have to add my usual disclaimer that I don't know if I would love it quite as much if I'd read it in print as I did with this fantastic narrator, but this one I think I would have. I really think the charm of the characters, the sweetness of the story, the adventure and and humor would translate no matter what. And considering how much several of my friends like the book too, I think I'm safe in recommending it, although you do have to keep in mind that it is intended for a middle school audience. ...more", "Title": "Magyk"},
