This was my reality: I believed with all my being that the things depicted above were real, and were just over the event horizon.

Is it any wonder that fiction \u2013 alternate realities, fantasy, and mental escape \u2013 helped me make that decision, helped me move on, and helped deprogram my cult-think? One fiction supplanted the other, only this time I already knew I was working with stories. Some of this fiction I had read many times, not understanding why the stories resonated so strongly within me, just knowing that I was compelled to return to those worlds, over and over. Others were stories I read during the time surrounding my breakaway, and shortly thereafter.* <+++>American Gods</+++> made me observe and think differently. It gave me a new context for the mythologies I had accepted for most of my life. It was bigger than the story of Shadow, or the girl Sam, or Czernabog. For me, it was about how we allow our Old Gods to define our present worldview, and how we allow our New Gods to steal our awareness. Our mythologies set the boundaries of our culture, and paradoxically, as our culture changes, our gods sacrifice their immortality. \"Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you--even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers, and triumphs over all opposition.\" The part of the story that affected me the most profoundly was the story of Hinzelmann and Lakeside. The mixing of good and evil, the blurring of lines, townspeople looking the other way \u2013 to such a degree that it never occurs to them to see what is happening right under their noses.<---F> Dead men's bones</---F>. Deaths of legends. It affected me to my core. During the time I was reading <+++>American Gods</+++> , it was this which rocked me \u2013 I was doing the same thing \u2013 choosing and keeping and killing my own Gods, my own mythologies. It was tremendously painful, made a little easier by having the opportunity to process it within the bounds of somebody else's story. *The rest of the list: Dune Chapterhouse Dune Fahrenheit 451 Animal Farm 1984 Sandman Crisis of Conscience Under the Banner of Heaven Seductive Poison ...more Anybody who tells you that the book is about old and new gods, or about a man named Shadow, or about coin tricks, or about having one's head smashed in for losing a game of checkers, is selling you a line, because those are just details, not the story itself.

The first 50ish pages were about the extent of where the book was interesting to me. Shadow meets Wednesday, and then the story turns into a bunch of mini stories and flashbacks, and I didn't enjoy most of them. Some were okay, but the majority just felt like annoying disruptions, and I felt myself thinking this is yet another longer book that could benefit from losing about 100 or so pages from the dragging middle. Shadow is paid by Wednesday to be an errand boy while he travels America trying to rally his troops in preparation for a war between The old Gods, and the new Gods (media and money) I guess it's my own fault. I couldn't really bring myself to care about this war between the new and old Gods, because the Gods of Media and Money? Not my Gods...

Of course that's not the books fault, but I was just expecting to like this book much more than I did. I never felt engaged while reading this book, and that's the reason I couldn't rate this above three stars. I could appreciate the great writing and originality, however, so I couldn't give it below three stars. Three stars it is folks, but as most of you know this book is loved by (almost) all, so of course I encourage everyone who is interested in this book already to read it, and form your own opinions.

I read the following section of the book nodding to myself, thinking, \"Yup, that's exactly what it's like.\" Then I had another thought: \"I bet this comes from that really bad cold snap we had here in Wisconsin about six years ago.\" It was pretty cool for me, being able to guess where a this piece of this book got its start.... For those of you who haven't read it: here's the excerpt. The main character, Shadow, has just come to a small Wisconsin town, and he decides to walk into town to buy some warmer clothes and groceries. * * * The cold snap had come, that was for sure. It could not be much above zero, and it would not be a pleasant walk, but he was certain he could make it into town without too much trouble. What did Hinzelmann say last night\u2014a ten-minute walk? And Shadow was a big man. He would walk briskly and keep himself warm. He set off south, heading for the bridge. Soon he began to cough, a dry, thin cough, as the bitterly cold air touched his lungs. Soon his ears and face and lips hurt, and then his feet hurt. He thrust his ungloved hands deep into his coat pockets, clenched his fingers together trying to find some warmth. [...] Step after step after step. He glanced back. The apartment building was not as far away as he had expected. This walk, he decided, was a mistake. But he was already three or four minutes from the apartment, and the bridge over the lake was in sight. It made as much sense to press on as to go home (and then what? Call a taxi on the dead phone? Wait for spring? He had no food in the apartment, he reminded himself). He kept walking, revising his estimates of the temperature downward as he walked. Minus ten? Minus twenty? Minus forty, maybe, that strange point on the thermometer when Celsius and Fahrenheit say the same thing. Probably not that cold. But then there was wind chill, and the wind was now hard and steady and continuous, blowing over the lake, coming down from the Arctic across Canada. Ten more minutes of walking, he guessed, and the bridge seemed to be no nearer. He was too cold to shiver. His eyes hurt. This was not simply cold: this was science fiction. This was a story set on the dark side of Mercury, back when they thought Mercury had a dark side. This was somewhere out on rocky Pluto, where the sun is just another star, shining only a little more brightly in the darkness. This, thought Shadow, is just a hair away from the places where air comes in buckets and pours just like beer. The occasional cars that roared past him seemed unreal: spaceships, little freeze-dried packages of metal and glass, inhabited by people dressed more warmly than he was. An old song his mother had loved, \u201cWalking in a Winter Wonderland,\u201d began to run through his head, and he hummed it through closed lips, kept pace to it as he walked. He had lost all sensation in his feet. He looked down at his black leather shoes, at the thin cotton socks, and began, seriously, to worry about frostbite. This was beyond a joke. This had moved beyond foolishness, slipped over the line into genuine twenty-four-karat Jesus-Christ-I-screwed-up-big-time territory. His clothes might as well have been netting or lace: the wind blew through him, froze his bones and the marrow in his bones, froze the lashes of his eyes, froze the warm place under his balls, which were retreating into his pelvic cavity. Keep walking, he told himself. Keep walking. I can stop and drink a pail of air when I get home.... * * * And that, my friends, is one of the many reasons I love Neil Gaiman.... ...more \"Read Gaiman!\" they say. \"I can't believe you've never read Gaiman!

Bye Gaiman! Let me quote: \"American Gods is Neil Gaiman's best and most ambitious novel yet, a scary, strange, and hallucinogenic road-trip story wrapped around a deep examination of the American spirit.\" I agree with everything but the beginning and the end. It certainly was scary, strange and hallucinogenic. None of it in a good way. I like nothing about this book. Not liking it isn't very difficult, because I have honestly no idea what was going on. Not that I didn't get the actual story, it wasn't that hard, since Mr. Gaiman sure isn't the most demanding writer (that isn't meant as a criticism, it can be a good thing). But why the things that were going on, were going on, completely eluded me. And while I kept on reading and wondering, 'huh? why? What now?', in the end, it all came up to \"Why should I care?\" This isn't my kind of book, mainly due to the subject and the characters. That's why I don't think anything Gaiman wrote would be my kind of book. It certainly isn't a book, or an author, you HAVE to read. I guess this, like that strange car race video game and Star Trek, will be parts of popular culture that will have to live without me. ...more I find myself shocked at the awards this book has won and the praise heaped upon it.

But Gods help me, the more I read, the more I hated American Gods . First off, while the premise sounds inter I find myself shocked at the awards this book has won and the praise heaped upon it. How on Gods\u2019 Earth could a book about Gods walking on the Earth among mortals be so pedestrian? Somehow Gaiman managed to turn a potentially cool premise into something boring. For those who love this book\u2014and I know it is many\u2014please forgive the sarcasm to follow as I blaspheme against the beloved Gaiman. But Gods help me, the more I read, the more I hated American Gods . First off, while the premise sounds interesting the more I thought about it, the less I liked it. The basic idea: the more worshippers a God has, the more powerful they are. The plot: there is a building power struggle between the old Gods (Norse, Native American, pagan, etc.) and the new Gods (Technology, Television, Money, etc.). Okay, I\u2019ve heard the ratio-of-worshippers-to-power idea before so that\u2019s not so original. But it\u2019s not a deal breaker. It has potential. Here\u2019s the unique twist in American Gods that caused my political antenna to start twitching\u2014every God (like say Odin) has an \u201cavatar\u201d of him or herself in each country. Or is it each continent? Gaiman\u2019s not quite clear about that. Would there be an Odin in Belgium and Luxembourg? Or does all of Europe get one Odin who is different from the American Odin? I find it politically disagreeable to suggest that every country (or even continent) has different God-avatars. To make this the premise turns intangible political entities (nations) into strictly bordered spiritual containers. It\u2019s parochial thinking. I disagree with this premise radically because I reject that people of a given \u201cnation\u201d are somehow bonded spiritually. Countries are artificial. Like Afghanistan. Like how we stole the native people\u2019s land to form America. I ascribe to the perspective that while people should always be fighting for political freedom and better political systems locally and nationally, we are truly citizens of the world together. The premise of American Gods manages to privilege the people in one country as somehow being united in their spiritual energy, feeding the Gods only within that country. As a metaphor (Gaiman repeatedly feels the need to state that this premise is a metaphor) it fails. There should be no metaphorical boundary between my spirit and my sister\u2019s and brother\u2019s spirits in Nicaragua, even if we have different local needs. Further, I could go on about how old Gods (religious deities) are in cahoots with modern Gods like wealth and technology. Just look at the fact that all the evangelists support the party of the 1%. Political oversensitivity on my part aside, the rant continues. The main character, Shadow, was about the dullest hero I\u2019ve ever read. For Gods\u2019 sake how many times do other characters have to refer to how \u201cbig\u201d he is? Is he a big man? He sure is big. Wow, you\u2019re big. Apparently he\u2019s big. Is he big? Oh boy is he a big man. Yep, he\u2019s big. He was big and boring and one-dimensional. So pure of heart that it grated on me. I found the majority of his dialogue to be trite and conventional. He struck me throughout as a pawn of the author (and yes he was a pawn of the Gods, too) more than a real being. His words were missing that spark of believability to bring the character to life. I didn\u2019t even believe his repeated sleight-of-hand behavior. It felt like a character trait on a chart that Gaiman could pull out every couple of chapters. And when it came to the other God characters? I just wasn\u2019t feelin\u2019 it. They seemed phony as all get-out. I did not find his representation of them credible. I think my reaction to their characterizations were primarily due to a reaction to mediocre dialogue. The dialogue wasn\u2019t awful, but I found it to be consistently off\u2014slightly awkward, slightly unnatural, subtly stilted. Most of the story was told in very close third person from Shadow\u2019s point-of-view. But every once in a while, Gaiman would throw in a chapter from another character\u2019s point-of-view. These chapters read in some ways like short stories inserted into the novel to expurgate some backstory, elucidate the God/worshipper premise in more detail, or delve into a side character. I find such techniques utterly amateurish. One or two \u201cinterludes\u201d in a book might be acceptable but to have an entire story driving in a close third person POV and then jump into another character because you can\u2019t \u201cexplain something\u201d from the primary POV is cheap. It\u2019s an easy out. I react badly when authors feel the need to \u201cexplain things\u201d to begin with. And to interrupt the flow of the structure you\u2019ve created to do so pisses me off. It made me feel as though Gaiman were talking down to me as the reader, like I was a little kid who didn\u2019t get it. Or like his storytelling just wasn\u2019t good enough to tell the story without jumping out of it to explain it. Understanding should come organically. Or else the POV jumping should happen more frequently, such as, every chapter. It\u2019s all about rhythm of storytelling. Swathes of American Gods were just plain boring. About 2/3 of the way through I started skipping whole paragraphs, then pages to get to plot events. All the stuff between the plot events was trying my patience. Shadow spends a great deal of time stuck in a small town in northern Wisconsin, meeting all these good-hearted locals and exploring bits of small-town life. I felt like I was stuck in a small town in northern Wisconsin during the winter the whole time. I\u2019m like\u2014this is not freaking Housekeeping and Gaiman sure ain\u2019t Marilynne Robinson. He does not have the writing chops to pull off an intimate look at real small-town life. Modest spoiler: (view spoiler) [The entire chapter where the old Gods meet the new Gods in truce made no logical sense. Even if the place they met was neutral due to its magical qualities, the new Gods simply had to track the trucks when the old Gods drove off and bomb the hell out of them. It was just this weird excuse to have some conversations between the old and new, between Shadow and the new Gods. And to get that body back. Contrived.

Shadow finds out that his father set up the war all for his own gain. So he goes in front of all the Gods \u2026 what is he going to say? How is he going to stop this horrendous war from occurring? What could he possibly say?!?! Well, he proceeds to explain to them that his father set up the war all for his own gain. Wow. I can\u2019t believe he pulled that off. Except by just explaining it. Which he did. Great. Thrilling. (hide spoiler) ] By the end, I was ready to shoot American Gods but I had to wade through an epilogue and a postscript. It was like a pimple on top of a wart. But I guess I\u2019m not surprised that he wanted to tie up loose ends after the climax because he couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it during the story itself. Bah. I viscerally disliked this book. I think it\u2019s because as a whole it felt emotionally manipulative. Such a charge could have been avoided with living, breathing characters. But despite the transparent planning and plotting, none of it rang true. Even Fantasy characters need to feel real. These didn\u2019t. ...more In this unique love letter to the United States, Gaiman manages to celebrate its underground spiritual traditions, glory in the magnificence of its landmarks, landscapes, and bizarre tourist traps, and--most important--both mourn and venerate its pagan (often immigrant) gods in decline, battered and diminished though they may be by the shallowness and speed of a technological world.

Therefore, upon learning that I had the opportunity to read Neil Gaiman\u2019s preferred and expanded version of AG containing an additional 12000 words, my reaction is what you might expect. I exploded into tears of ecstasy, lost my bowels and wept uncontrollably for well over an hour. This made for a particularly awkward moment at the book store but at least I was prepared\u2026 Later, when I was calmed down, cleaned up and baby powdered, I sat down and tore through this over the weekend. Since this is the 10th anniversary edition of this modern fantasy classic, I am going to assume that a fair number of you reading this are at least familiar with the story. However, I will still avoid major spoilers in this review, except for disclosing (1) the identity of Wednesday and (2) the basic plot. Both of these things are revealed pretty early in the book so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m story flashing any of you with this information. I just think it is difficult to explain the novel without these two nuggets of bookformation. Therefore, for those of you that don\u2019t want any spoilers, you may want to look away now\u2026 \u2026.for everyone else, let\u2019s talk AMERICAN GODS\u2026.and English gods\u2026and Irish gods\u2026and Norse/Scandinavian gods\u2026German and Russian gods\u2026and Egyptian gods\u2026and Greek gods (plus those \u201cFUCKING Albanian\u201d gods)\u2026and Indian, Hindu and Japanese gods\u2026and Hungarian gods\u2026and Babylonian and Persian gods\u2026and Native American gods\u2026and Voodoo gods\u2026and African gods\u2026.and even \u201cforgotten\u201d gods...plus all manner of dwarf, sprite, imp, giant, kobold, vampire, mythological beast, djinn, witch\u2026and one very large and mysterious SHADOW !! Just listing the countries represented in this book makes me smile and break out in goose zits. THE TALE OF AMERICAN GODS So our guide throughout the story is Shadow. Shadow\u2019s a big, soft spoken, even tempered bad-ass, ex-con whose life is shattered by the tragic death of his wife in a car accident (there is more to it than that, but, you know, spoilers and such). While reeling from the aftermath of his loss, Shadow is approached by smooth-talking and mysterious grifter named Mr. Wednesday. [HERE COMES MINOR SPOILER #1] . Turns out, Wednesday is actually a manifestation of Odin, ruler of the Norse Gods, and king of all things Asgardian. Why you ask is the \u201cAllFather,\u201d the god of war, wisdom, poetry and magic scraping his way through life as an aging con man? Ah\u2026.that brings us to the heart and soul of the story. You see gods are sustained and kept strong, according to the novel, by people\u2019s worship and their belief in them. Thus, when the ancient Norsemen came to America, they brought belief in their gods with them. When they made sacrifices to Odin, Thor and the rest of the Norse gods, it made them strong and powerful. Conversely, as the people forgot about the gods and stopped telling their tales and making offerings to them, their power waned, until now at the beginning of the 21st century in America, Odin\u2019s godly \u201cvigor\u201d is all but lost. Meanwhile, the \u201cgods\u201d of the 21st century have grown strong and powerful. These new gods of Media, Technology, Internet, Electricity, Highways, Drugs, etc. are young, brash and dripping with vitality due to the worship and adoration they receive from you and me. Now, these godly young turkers and looking to destroy Odin and his ilk forever and claim supremacy over all of godness. A war is coming\u2026sweet!!! Realizing the powerful of the 21st century gods, Odin is on recruiting mission to gather up the old gods and get them to sack up in order to avoid being slaughtered at the hands of the upstarts. He hires Shadow to be a glorified errand boy at $500 bucks a week and to accompany him as he travels America (and places in between) trying to rally his gang of gods to fight in the coming battle. From a broad brush perspective, that is really the frame for this novel. However, as with all great art, the beauty of this story is in the details, the aspects, the shadings, the nuances. Odin\u2019s mission acts as a terrific catalyst for Gaiman to explore the history of America, his great love of mythology and the enormous power of belief. \u2018This is the only country in the world,\u2019 said Wednesday, into the stillness, \u2018that worries about what it is\u2026.The rest of them know what they are. No one ever needs to go searching for the heart of Norway. Or looks for the soul of Mozambique. They know what they are.\u2019 As with many of my favorite books, this is a \u201cjourney\u201d story and not a \u201cdestination\u201d story. Thus, if you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t like tangents, flashbacks, veer offs or segues in your plot and are constantly hoping to straight line towards the conclusion, than this book might frustrate you enough to cause hives. This is a beautiful, elegant, but long and meandering journey through the heart and soul of America full of rich and detailed landscapes, historical flashbacks, memorable characters and mythological anecdotes. Now, despite the novel taking its sweet, leisurely time sauntering towards the end, when it finally gets there, it is arguably my favorite 100 pages of any book EVER. In fact, the climax is so amazingly good that is it likely to cause one\u2026so be prepared Of course, I am talking about the final dust up between the old and the new. This segment is filled with more gods and legendary creatures than I have ever seen assembled in one story (if you are a South Park fan, think Imagination Land and you will have an idea of the kind a concentrated star power I mean). There's never been a true war that wasn't fought between two sets of people who were certain they were in the right. The really dangerous people believe they are doing whatever they are doing solely and only because it is without question the right thing to do. And that is what makes them dangerous. ADDITIONS TO THE PREFERRED TEXT For those of you that have read the original and are wondering whether this expanded edition is worth your time, I say yes\u2026with a caveat. I don\u2019t see a need to go rush out and read this if you have just finished the original version of American Gods. The story is basically the same and the added text is not so extensive that they change the essence of the novel. However, it you are thinking of a re-read or have never read the story before, I would certainly recommend this edition as I think it provides some additional insight and clarifications that are interesting and worthwhile. Plus, this expanded version also includes a very neat \u201capocryphal\u201d segment in the afterward showing Shadow meeting up with Jesus that I thought was interesting. Overall, I love this book. I have now read it three times (something I do not generally do with books) and I am fairly certain that a fourth time is in my future. If you love mythology, it is hard for me to imagine you not loving this book. One thing I would recommend is that you have handy either your own mythology guide or else a link to this website that lists all of the gods appearing in the novel. http://frowl.org/gods/gods.html#odin I think it enhances the experience of the story significantly being able to match up the people encountered in the book with their mythological persona. 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! P.S. BONUE QUOTE I couldn\u2019t find a way to work this in above, but it is one of my favorite quotes from the book, so I wanted to share it: God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of the players, to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won\u2019t tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time. ...more Do you ever read a book and become completely lost in the words and, ultimately, wonder what is actually happening? Well, I do. So, I go back and read the bits I may not have picked up or accidently skimmed over. This allows me to actually understand the book. I tried doing that with this, and I quickly realised that I still had no idea what was going on. The plot of this felt completely random, drawn out to the point of ridiculousness and the events, themselves, felt incoherent.

So, I go back and read the bits I may not have picked up or accidently skimmed over. This allows me to actually understand the book. I tried doing that with this, and I quickly realised that I still had no idea what was going on. The plot of this felt completely random, drawn out to the point of ridiculousness and the events, themselves, felt incoherent. I have no idea why most of the events actually happened in here, and at this point, I can honestly say that just I don\u2019t care anymore. Did I miss something? The book begins with the protagonist, Shadow, finishing his prison sentence. On the day of release his wife is killed in a car accident. What initially appears as mere bad fortune slowly evolves into what can only be considered as something much odder. His wife\u2019s ghost visits him, and assists him in the random events he then encounters. I say random because that\u2019s exactly what this book is. The events that occurred had no discernible point. I kept expecting to see some reasoning behind it all, but just couldn\u2019t. Perhaps I missed something. But the plot of this felt barely connected. There was an overall lack of cohesion and plot driver. I had very little reason to read this, and as I got further and further into it, I had even less. The book seemed to be going in a weird direction of its own that felt completely ungraspable. I just don\u2019t understand the point of most of it; the characters all felt like they belonged in a psyche ward. I understand the overall meaning of the book, but the way in which the author presented it was awful. The actual events and scenes that took place were bizarre to the point of them having no purpose. For me, this book needed much more than just an overall juxtaposition of god types; it needed to be enjoyable on the surface level as well; it needed a proper plot. This book almost killed me If a book bores me this much, and confuses me this much, when reading, the overall message of the book cannot save it in my estimation. The reading process was dull and plain arduous, I wanted to cry at points because it was that bad. Indeed, I had to force myself to complete reading this incredibly packed out, and rambling piece of randomness. If someone asked me to give a concise summary of the book, and tell them what happened, I\u2019d be unable to complete the task. Perhaps it\u2019s just me, but this book is so strange. I have nothing positive to say about it, in any respect, and absolutely hated reading it. I just can\u2019t appreciate what Gainman was trying to achieve because he did it such a roundabout way. I simply detest this book. It was an absolute trudge to finish it. This just seemed far too long. The message that the author was trying to capture could have been done in half the word count. Perhaps, it doesn\u2019t help that my copy was the original version, which means its twelve thousand words longer than the normal one. For me, this meant that there were entire chapters that were completely pointless. Nothing happened in them, and nothing was achieved through them. At points, this novel felt like a connected series of events that could barely be considered a plot. It will, indeed, be many months before I pick up another book by this author, maybe even years, maybe not ever again. I\u2019ll never forgive the author for this tripe.

What is going on here, what are they trying to prove?? I really don't understand it. I mean you'd never get \"British Beauty\", \"French Psycho\", would you? That just seems completely laughable. Anyway, I really didn't get this book. It made no sense to me at all. I mean it's a fun conceit, that gods are living among men in modern day America, desperate to regain the faith they once commanded, but I just felt like it wasn't thought through properly. It presents itself as being predicated on the idea that \u2018America is a bad land for gods\u2019 \u2013 this is something that characters keep saying to one another, moodily, that America is a really bad land for gods \u2013 and this is apparently why all the gods are now living hand-to-mouth existences as drifters or menial labourers. Only \u2013 huh? Are we talking about the same America here? The one where 51 percent of the population think that humans were created by a divine being, and a further 40 percent think they were created by evolution which was set in motion by a divine being (leaving, as Tim Minchin said, a very small percentage of Americans who are right)? Is that the America that is supposed to be a bad land for gods? Do me a favour, it must be one of the most religious countries in the western world. I've driven through my share of rural Tennessee, where much of American Gods takes place, and one of the most striking things about these communities is the fact that there seems to be one church for every six or seven houses. God is invoked on the currency, on the news, by the head of state, and in schoolrooms every morning by little kids. This is what is so frustrating about the book, because it seems like a brilliant chance to examine religion in the US in a cool and interesting way \u2013 but it doesn't. It either doesn't dare or it doesn't bother. I mean \u2013 if you're going to run with this idea that gods are walking around, with the more powerful deities being those who have the most believers, then where the fuck is Yahweh? I'm supposed to believe that Anubis is twatting around driving a hearse in fucking Cairo, IL. \u2013 despite the fact that no one in the history of America has ever worshipped Anubis \u2013 and yet Jesus doesn't make a single appearance? Somehow it's OK to play around with foreign gods that seem quaint or folkloric, but monotheism's off the table. It just didn't make any sense to me.\u00b9 Instead, what we have to propel the narrative along is just a kind of comic-book war that we're supposed to care about. So although there were quite a few scenes that had me flipping the pages with engagement, there was always this nagging feeling that none of it really meant anything and that I didn't really care very much what happened to anyone. It doesn't help that the protagonist (with the dreadful name of \u2018<---C>Shadow Moon</---C>\u2019) is, for a central character, annoyingly passive and lacking in personality (although the goddesses he encounters still have a remarkable habit of wanting to have sex with him). As for the writing style, well, it's fine, but it has absolutely no flair. There's quite an interesting bit in the Acknowledgements where Gaiman thanks many of his beta-readers and editors for spotting \u2018stray and unintentional anglicisms\u2019, presumably so he could remove them; this I think is something that contributes to the featureless blandness of his style. I'm not saying he is unentitled to this voice or anything like that \u2013 his wife is American, he lives in America, this is totally an authentic voice for him. It's just not one that has any character. It works in a kind of tab-A-into-slot-B way. This is certainly not a bad book and it's quite readable \u2013 I think I'm just disappointed because I had unfairly high hopes, and I liked the concept, and I have a lot of friends who really enjoyed it. For me it was just a bit baffling and cartoony. In the same way that His Dark Materials is like a children's story for grown-ups, American Gods felt like an adult story for children. This is my third Neil Gaiman book (after Sandman and Smoke and Mirrors ) and they have all been underwhelming; I think I'll just leave him alone now, since I'm sure they deserve higher ratings than I'm prepared to give them, but that's what you get when I try and squeeze in a review at 01:23 am in a foreign city when I still have another two hours' work to do before I can go to bed. \u00b9This \"Tenth Anniversary Edition\" includes in its appendices a brief section in which Jesus does, in fact make a brief appearance. This was cut from the original published version, and you can see why; it is very short and it raises more questions than it answers. The problem is, these are the questions the book should have been about. ...more American Gods by Neil Gaiman, by the author\u2019s own description, is a work that has inspired strong emotions and little in between \u2013 readers have either liked it a lot, or loathed it entirely.

And I\u2019m not talking about myths, but rather, as he puts it, the myths we have lived with, tangled into the skein of our culture and even formed ourselves. Like many great works, and I do count this work among that group, the story works on multiple levels. It is on its surface a fantasy, rich in detail and fun to read, but also on the level of metaphor with complicated ideas and symbols thrown in, a novel that leaves the reader satisfied but still with a lot to consider once the book is put down. And like almost all great works, putting the book down is not an easy thing, and difficult to admit that the story is over. ...more a protagonist, Shadow. calm, collected, quiet, passive, cagey, a tough guy and a sensitive guy. his life has been about reacting and not impacting. he moves through his story as if through a dream; tragedies and betrayals and mysteries and confidence games, the beginnings and endings of hope and love and life - all viewed as if through water, as if these terrible wonders were happening to someone else. he could be nothing more than a pawn in life - let alone a pawn of the gods - but yet his pass a protagonist, Shadow. calm, collected, quiet, passive, cagey, a tough guy and a sensitive guy. his life has been about reacting and not impacting. he moves through his story as if through a dream; tragedies and betrayals and mysteries and confidence games, the beginnings and endings of hope and love and life - all viewed as if through water, as if these terrible wonders were happening to someone else. he could be nothing more than a pawn in life - let alone a pawn of the gods - but yet his passivity is combined with an inner strength, a gentle kindness, an innate decency. his decency is more than a trait - it defines him. and when he does decide to act, his actions become another one of this novel's terrible wonders. he is complex and completely appealing. one of my my favorite heroes in modern fiction. a wife, Laura. dead before the novel begins. a living ghost, a revenant; aided by a magical coin. a sad and appalling and dreamlike journey. a terrific payoff. a Road Trip, full of kitchen-sink reality, full of terrible wonder. an old guard, the Old Gods.

Technology, the Media, the Vehicle, the Men in Black. it's easy to put them all automatically in a nice little box labeled The Villains. but that's too simple; too instantly gratifying. the novel's portrait of these potentially repellent figures is one painted in broad strokes, lacking subtlety - but it is also a fair one... they sound and act like villains, and yet they are not. how can they be? we worship them on a daily basis. they are only evil if we consider our modern age an evil one. a creepy subsidiary villain: a Kobold. he lives in a portrait of classic americana that miraculously manages to be free of condescension. a Confidence Game, long-game style, played by two gods, with our hero as their catspaw. cleverly done by the gods. beautifully overturned by our hero. brilliantly pulled off by the author. an author, Neil Gaiman. i'll admit that i have well-stocked reserves of love for the man, ready and willing to be accessed. his Sandman series is my favorite comic book, full of crazy imagination and complex mysteries and creepy villains and complicated heroes and terrible, wonderful journeys. so i was prepared to love this book as i love its author, to draw upon that deep well of affection. there were connecting factors that helped to ease my transition from dealing with my old god of awesome comics to this new literary god of popular fantasy fiction; namely his interest in unearthing and revitalizing the world's myths and legends - an ongoing Gaiman leitmotif. i was less prepared to discover that Gaiman is an actual writer! his prose is fluid, nuanced, supple, at ease with both constant ambiguity and you-are-there, detailed realism. both grounded and hallucinatory. the narrative is anchored by everyday reality as well as a strange lack of affect - a blankness of tone that is a good fit for a phantasmagorical road trip. and then it is capable of sudden, surreal flights of visionary madness, a grey-toned package that becomes a conjurer's box of magic. and then that tricksy legerdemain can just as quickly transform back into a soulful and emotionally honest portrait of one man's journey through various adventures, through his own life, to the end of it and back again. who could ask for more? ...more This book (in a very round about way) taught me what good literature is.

Now, I was surprised to hear this because Neil Gaiman is usually a nonstop sex and violence party of disaffected goth teenager fantasy. Furthermore, I didn't really believe in good literature. I had had so much obvious bull-plop literary analysis crammed down my throat in high school (A high school teacher once said to our class \"In the Great Gatsby, green means go, FOR SEX!\") I'm a logical type of dude, and such literary analysis seemed like wildly speculative and unfounded pondering. So I asked my mom, what makes good literature and she said two things make good literature: (1) Language must be used in an artistic way. (2) There must be serious themes or metaphors in the work. And this, for the first time ever, made literature make sense to me. By this metric, American Gods is good literature. This book is very well written. The language is complex but it flows well and reads easily. The description is deep and enveloping, but does not make the reading labored. This book is about how the old gods, brought to America in the myth and beliefs of immigrants for thousands of years, are alive on the fringes of our society. Our culture has no time for them, and they wither and grow old in the lack of worship. These gods, such as Anansi, Easter, and The Queen of Sheba, can practice magic; but they are relegated to the position of grifters, criminals, con men, and prostitutes. Meanwhile, the new gods, gods of technology, internet, wall street, and media are becoming strong and want to kill off the old gods. This book is the story of their war. Of course, the book is rife with themes and metaphors about religion and America in general. And everyone has a take on what it all means. You can read many people here on Good Reads' take on it. You can read mine below, I don't want to affect your opinion about the book if you don't want me to. I read this book because my mom recommended it, because I like Neil Gaiman, and because I wanted to see what it was all about. WARNING THEMATIC DISCOVERY SPOILER (could ruin the fun, as unwrapping the metaphor of this book is as fun if not more so than discovering the plot.) I think that this book is about the cultural shift in America that has been occurring over the last quarter century. The specific cultural shift of which I speak is the shift to a country wide homogeneous culture. Mom and Pop stores have been giving way to Walmart. Local restaurants give way to McDonald's, Subway, Olive Garden, or the Cheese Cake Factory. Local television stations are no longer watched in favor of Digital Cable or Satellite Television. Local Radio stations are bought up by clear channel and local or idiosyncratic programming is scrubbed in favor of nation wide play lists. Ethnic or local cultures are assimilated into the new American culture. The old gods are metaphors of the ethnic immigrant and local cultures in America. The stories about how each god came to America are not about the gods themselves, they are about the immigrants who believe in them, and how they came to the new world. The new gods represent the culturally homogenizing forces in America. They are the internet, the media, credit, and technology. Repeatedly Gaiman refers to \"the battle for the soul of America\" between the new and old gods. This battle represents the assimilation of the American people into the new homogeneous culture and how this causes us to for go our ethnic backgrounds. ...more A man was swallowed by a woman's vagina - so my mom wrote me a note and now I don't have to review this book anymore. DNF 26% I tried, okay? I genuinely want to like Neil Gaiman. I want to fall in love with his stories, and be enchanted, and all things wonderful. But this book is not going to do that for me.

I wanted god-like powers so I'd have the power to read through and like American Gods, but alas, I am only human and cannot smite Neil Gaiman for my disappointment. I have to hand it to Neil Gaiman for coming up with this fantastic concept, a Battle Royale between the old and the new gods. What's not to like? Plenty as it turns out. I know I am not alone in my disappointment with American Gods.I buddy read this with my friends Vane and Evelyn (who hasn't finished yet), but Vane and I have pretty much similar gripes. On the bigger scale though, we're probably the odd ducks as this is such a popular and critically acclaimed novel. One of the biggest issues I have with American Gods is its main protagonist, Shadow . He's a lug with a penchant for coin tricks and is dull. I'm not sure if he's really meant to be that way to contrast with the bigger-than-life deities or he's just an underdeveloped character, either way it worked against the narrative of the story. The old deities were just a little better written than Shadow, while the new gods were laughably undeveloped. I didn't care for any of them at all. Early on in the book the end-goal is discussed at some length, so I was filled with anticipation as to whom will join their fight, but that anticipation withered as the story dragged on to anywhere but the fight. I had to read 10% each day as per our buddy read contract (emoji filled gchat really, but who cares), but most days I was just like At around 80%, I was all It's a shame really as the plot was really good, but the execution was just TOO tedious. I'm sure the word weird has been thrown a lot when talking about American Gods. Oh, it is plenty weird, but the world itself is not weird as much as muddled and poorly incorporated. I guess when gods walk among men, everything else is fair game, it doesn't matter if mortals can grasp it or not. It certainly takes Deus Ex Machina to a different level. This is my first Gaiman and I'm not impressed yet.Normally, I'm a fan of the weird, the strange and fantastical, this is not one of those times. ...more I did like this, I liked this very much.

There is a Gary Larson cartoon stacked full of all of the gods that no one believes in anymore \u2013 I can barely remember it \u2013 some sort of retirement home for forgotten gods. If you took that cartoon, stirred in some Tom Waits, added a dash or two of Joseph Campbell, sprinkled a handful of jet black humour, creamed in a murder mystery and plopped a few cubes of Houdini\u2019s more impressive escape acts you might have some idea what this book is like. More than once I laughed with pure delight, though more often I just smiled at how nicely this was written and how well the story was handled. Okay, it nearly got away from him towards the end and there was probably just a bit too much talking to camera at one point which is always the least impressive way to explain a major plotting point \u2013 even after all this had been handled so much competently (ie trusting the reader more) earlier in the book \u2013 I still loved this book. The idea of the Gods being virtually unemployed and eking out a living on road kill or through prostitution was very amusing. Some of the asides were as interesting as the story itself. Who would have thought that Genies would be such queer things? I\u2019m not really one to read fantasy novels, but this one was quite something. Clever, fast paced and with themes of life, death, love, revenge, obligation, gratitude, desire, loss and the right time for things to happen \u2013 how could I not like this book?

I realize that my feelings on Gaiman and his books are contrary to popular opinion, but they are just not my cup of tea. They are slow. They seem intentionally odd and artsy. By the end, I just don't care anymore. I think trying 3 of his books shows I have given him a good chance, but now it may be time to part ways. American Gods has its interesting storylines (that is why I have rounded up to 3 stars) but overall, I didn't see the point. I expected some really interesting stuff to happen between all the Gods and mortals, but instead I got sometimes boring, sometimes unintelligible speeches, or really odd occurrences that come out of nowhere and make no sense. In general, I am not really sure why any of it happened other than Gaiman spewed forth some really weird stream of consciousness (This was the same way I felt about The Ocean at the End of the Lane ). So - if you love Gaiman, keep on reading! But, don't fault me for not caring for is style after several tries, it is just how I feel and I don't think it is going to get any better. ...more This is my Book Of the Month- October 2016, with GR group- The Reading For Pleasure Book Club, Category:Fiction Group Read.

I did not know what to expect going into this book and was happy with the overall concept of this story. This is all about Old Gods and the New, Dead rising from the grave, lots of confusing dreams, a road journey, mystery, war and last but not the least CON jobs! OLD GODS: \"They brought me, and Loki and Thor, Anansi and the Lion-God, Leprechauns and Kobolds and Banshees, Kubera and Frau Holle and Ashtaroth, and they brought you.\" The story fluctuates from present to different times in past where we come across the beliefs of people in olden days for a deity and what is the current condition of the said deity in America. This was really interesting to read as I came across a lot of Old Gods and folklore related to them that I wasn't aware of. NEW GODS: \"There are new gods growing in America, clinging growing knots of belief: gods of credit card and freeway, of Internet and telephone, of radio and hospital and television, gods of plastic and of beeper and of neon.\" And then there is an ongoing War between the Old Gods and the New. This felt more like watching an old movie with gang war involved and I think the author did a really smart job here. \"Yes, it's still God's Own Country,\" said the announcer, a news reporter pronouncing the final tag line. \"The only question is, which gods?\" Then there are the dreams which are damn confusing but an integral part of the story! \" 'I feel', Shadow told her, 'like I'm in a world with its own sense of logic. Its own rules. Like when you're in a dream, and you know there are rules you mustn't break'. \" The book has a surreal and eerie feel to it. The plot is really good but I had a few problems. Firstly, it took time for me to get used to the author's writing style. Even after I got into the rhythm of reading it, there were parts involving multiple people conversation which confused me and I had to go back and read it again to understand who said what! I don't mind a big book but the moment I start feeling the story is long is not a good sign and that's what happened while reading this. The story feels too long and I just wanted it to end even though what was happening was intriguing. Also, the main protagonist- Shadow was emotionless.

I think the reason for this extreme reaction is the way he writes his stories. It can be called fantasy, but actually it's closer to myth with its rambling style and narrative inconsistencies. \"American Gods\" is the tale of Shadow and his part in the struggle between the traditional Gods from all over the world who have immigrated to the New World, and the Gods of America (those of media, celebrity, technology, and drugs). These Gods exist because people believe in them: and the new ones are engaged in an epic battle with the old ones for the mastery of the American mind. The tale is very broad in its sweep and contains many subplots and side alleys, typical of any old-world mythical saga.

Half-crazy gods, zombie ex wife, tarnished-but-decent hero, missing kids, and unlikely friendships. However, it's also got everything I usually despise in a book. Trippy/hallucinogenic dream sequences, random quotes from other pieces of literature, plodding storyline, and no action. But Neil Gaiman just oozes so much talent that somehow I still liked it. Which is saying a lot, because I'm normally a real asshole when I feel like a book needed to be chopped down by about 400 pages. Although, unless someone can tell me that Anansi Boys is an Awesome-Not-To-Be-Missed-Roller-Coaster-Thrill-A-Minute-Ride, I'm gonna have to say no to that one. ...more \u201cEvery hour wounds.

It's hard to cover a book effectively that dares to be so creative in its scope, because I know I won't cover everything. Hell, I know I didn't even get everything. It probably reveals more of itself with each reread. Essentially a play on people's beliefs and how the strength in that can shape people, cultures and eventually societies. People sometimes let go of old gods and beliefs, either by not believing anymore and paying little attention, or else forgetting them completely. The other half just adopts new ones and recycles them out quickly and irreverently as new technologies merge. American Gods shows those that originally existed, to become strengthened by the people who worship them, and the new ones who were completely birthed because people wanted/needed them at the time. The book is that but oh-so-much more too. See, already I'm rambling in this review... It follows Shadow as a main character, a man freshly out of prison and a new widow. He runs into another man who clearly holds supernatural prowess but much mystery - should Shadow trust and follow Mr Wednesday so freely? As a man with little to lose and very little to gain, Shadow falls into a seemingly benign job that comes to have world-wide potential. Shadow makes a worthy main character to follow - he thinks for himself but he follows a little blindly, realizing that he doesn't have to get everything before he commits to each. Wednesday is epic and holds surprises, a favorite of mine. There are plenty of characters - supernaturally touched or not - and all are them are well created and useful in the story. Laura surprised me by being one of the best side characters. Gaiman's writing style is smooth going and an easy addiction. His words flow into each well and he dishes out dialogue that's easy to hang on to. To say he's creative with his story structure and surprises is a little bit of an understatement. I had pre-guessed some of the revelations, but never all of them. I get the bulk of the story, but there are small tendrils that confuse me. Such as this (only read if you've read the book) (view spoiler) [Obviously for the ritual to take place, he would have had to known it would be done since it needed to be done by someone (spear in side). I have to say I don't get why he told him not to mess with him earlier because he didn't want him to ever be a martyr, when he really wanted him to become one - I'm assuming he was telling Mr. Town something, knowing he would do the opposite, like reverse psychology. It's a little confusing. (hide spoiler) ] The book gets brownie points for this alone - \u201cWhat I say is, a town isn\u2019t a town without a bookstore. It may call itself a town, but unless it\u2019s got a bookstore, it knows it\u2019s not foolin\u2019 a soul.\u201d Overall it's an epic novel that should be experienced. I'm ignorant on mythology so some of this was over my head, but it was still creatively constructed, beautifully written, and rewarded my interest with fascinating twists. This my second book of Gaimans. I really need to check out his Sandman series next. ...more I enjoyed American Gods, a huge sprawling endeavor of a book. The concept of \"old versus modern\" gods is an intriguing one, and I can always get involved in themes of belief, stories and myth. It didn't always work, however, and while I liked it, I'd hesitate to say \"I really liked it.\" Transitions can be rough, and it's not always clear where a particular chunk of narrative is heading.

I feel like part of it is that we have indeed lost the old gods, and many people need a little background on Gaiman's creatures in order to appreciate the tale he's telling. Often it's well done, but at times it interrupts the flow of the narrative. I often enjoy Gaiman's imagery, although occasionally it's self indulgent, seemingly for the sake of being shocking, like the woman that swallows a man through her vagina during sex, and a dead person vomiting maggots. A few loose ends don't particularly seem pertinent, (view spoiler) [ such as the leprechaun that gives Shadow a gold piece, which Shadow then is moved to throw it into Laura's grave. I'm not sure of the point of that subplot either--the power of belief? (hide spoiler) ] I'm never particularly moved by Gaiman's use of language, but he has a deft hand at characterization. Characters and ideas are clearly his strengths. I loved some of the old gods, and thought Mr. Nancy and the Chicago family particularly well done. The new gods were less well done, though the concept is a fascinating one. Most of the time is spent on the internet/tech and media gods, and they are done well enough to be immediately annoying. However, the pantheon gets a little fuzzy at this point, particularly in Gaiman's decision to largely leave out \"modern\" organized religion--as Anubis and Bast and such were worshipped by Egyptians, it seems fair to acknowledge Jesus as more than a hitchhiker in Afganistan. I wonder if he avoided it for complexity? Controversy? The voice and tone is narrator is emotionally removed from the story, but I felt it suited the tone and scope of the novel well. I liked Shadow and felt he was a very believable character for a while. Emphasizing his numbness and distance helped explained how he could be so blase about the return of his dead wife and Mr. Wednesday's abilities. It's interesting that after his initial questioning and challenging of Mr. Wednesday and the leprechaun, he accepts the rest of the magic at face value. I have mixed feelings about the ending. (view spoiler) [ I'm a little disappointed that Shadow chose to \"rest,\" and wonder if it's inconsistent, as all along he's been Wednesday's man, paid to work and protect him. And the fact that the plot of the novel is a double con--well, I too feel more than a little betrayed. It seemed weak that both old and new gods took Shadow's announcement and popped back to reality, ready to abandon the fight then and there. Certainly their animosity had to be based on something, and removal of primary motivation doesn't remove built up antagonism.

In the meantime, I put my head down, looked at the final goal and read Gaiman in between. On a dreary Monday, I took a break. The university was lousy with students all making up for lost time, cramming, pushing deadlines and making for long queues that stood between myself and food. I found some sustenance, a table under a gum tree, and sat. 'Mind if I join you?' There was a smile with frizzy hair. A middle-aged woman was waiting for my response. 'Sure,' I replied, happy to share. I had a book; it wouldn't be awkward. We sat for a while. She was enjoying her food. I was enjoying my food and book. 'He is a fantastic storyteller isn't he?' she gestured towards my book. 'Mmm,' I confirmed with a mouth full. 'How are you enjoying it this time around?' 'Well, it's been over ten years. I read it when it first came out. I was a different person back then.' 'I know.' 'I remember the gist of the story, but the details are like new.' 'Back then you weren't a worshipper. But now you are. You're one of my flock; you revere my words and my values,'she said in a small voice. 'You know me well now. You are training to be one of my priests. You're going out into the world soon to spread my word. Evolutionary biology, global warming, Mohorovicic discontinuity. 'Does the book differ now that you are part of a flock?' she asked with a cheeky smile. 'A good story is a good story, no matter what belief the reader holds. Whether they worship old gods or new gods like you.' 'A new god?!' she gasped in mock horror. 'I'll have you know that I was there long before Odin, long before the bull-headed man. I was there when the chimp-human common ancestor picked up a rock and hit it on his enemies head!' 'Well, you don't show it.' She brushed off my compliment with a sweep of her hand. 'I hope you're beginning to understand the power of a good story coupled with a good storyteller. Both may have some faults, but together they have made the world what it is. The story may be how the world was made, or how you managed to make fire. Both are just as important. Neil knows that.' I nodded in agreement, turning the book over in my hands. 'But he isn't one of yours is he?' 'Neil has been touched by a lot of us, myself included.' She wiped her mouth with a paper napkin. 'Well, finish the book off and get back to your assignments. I've invested a lot in you. Don't let me down.' I smiled as she stood. 'I won't.' ...more I understand why American Gods is a crossover classic for fantasy and fiction lovers: there are multiple layers to unravel, threads to pull, ideas to chew on, oddities to marvel at.

But this read for me was one where some of the parts are better than the sum of the parts, and while I intellectually liked the top macro layer (old gods versus new gods, how we as humans define ourselves and our reality and what takes us away from that realization and awareness) and I enjoyed some of the micro layers (a lot of the little anecdotes in between the narrative chapters were intriguing and charming and fresh), the main story for me lacked action, urgency, and emotional depth. It's a solid 3 star rating from me: I liked it and am happy to have finally read a Neil Gaiman book, but it was somewhat underwhelming and less cohesive than I might have liked. I preferred many of the side stories and ancillary characters to the focal points of the main narrative, whose personalities ranged from benignly boring (Shadow) to irritatingly enigmatic (Mr. Wednesday). Perhaps, even if I like my protagonists in shades of gray as well as black and white, I prefer great writing, interesting ideas AND action, and here though the ideas came fast and furious, not enough of them coalesced into real action and plot development for my taste. It's a book that's hard to pin down: road trip, heroic epic, little short stories, a general philosophizing about the merits and demerits about the myth of America and the American way. Its meandering nature means that one can easily get lost in the bombardment of content, which can be quite fun, but some of these brief trips into other tales were more tantalizing than the main yarn. It's not uninteresting, but I was occasionally wearied by yet another motel scene, yet another bizarre interaction with a New God, yet another person remarking on Shadow's size. And though the storytelling and structure didn't hint at a climactic conclusion, the way the plot unfolded and hinted at a war between the gods, I did expect a greater, larger showdown in the book's final act, and was mildly let down by what and how it came to pass. But there's also so much I did enjoy: Mr. Ibis and Jacquel's funeral parlor and the weighing of souls, the tale of Agasu and Wututu, Mr. Nancy, the tale of Essie Tregowan, the town of Lakeside and its unspoken deal with \"the devil\" to ensure peace and prosperity. And there are great ideas I was intellectually thrilled by, like: Fiction allows us to slide into these other heads, these other places, and look out through other eyes. And then in the tale we stop before we die, or we die vicariously and unharmed, and in the world beyond the tale we turn the page or close the book, and we resume our lives. A life, which is, like any other, unlike any other. and \"This is the only country in the world,\" said Wednesday, into the stillness, \"that worries about what it is.\" \"What?\" \"The rest of them know what they are. No one ever needs to go searching for the heart of Norway. Or looks for the soul of Mozambique. They know what they are.\" and People believe, thought Shadow. It's what people do. They believe. And then they will not take responsibility for their beliefs; they conjure things, and do not trust the conjurations. People populate the darkness; with ghosts, with gods, with electrons, with tales. People imagine, and people believe: and it is that belief, that rock-solid belief, that makes things happen. Overall, this is a fascinatingly constructed group of tales and has a wealth of ideas and anecdotes that made for a solid reading experience. But the main plot and characters were not quite as strong to sustain my engaged interest throughout, and I ultimately admired more than enjoyed this. experience. I am happy to have read this, but I would not throw over my old gods of beloved literary fantasy novels to worship at the altar of American Gods , though I can believe in its charms and powers for other readers. ...more An incredible adventure!

As the people assimilated their beliefs often weakened too affecting their old gods. But change has come. Major change in the form of new beliefs, new gods, large and small, which threaten the old gods existence. And Neil Gaiman has brought us into the center of the fray, old vs new. In what will be the first of many dream-like experiences, Shadow, central to the story and to my enjoyment, experiences the following: Shadow was in a dark place, and the thing staring at him wore a buffalo's head, rank and furry with huge wet eyes. Its body was a man's body, oiled and slick. \"Changes are coming,\" said the buffalo without moving his lips. \"There are certain decisions that will have to be made.\" Firelight flickered from wet cave walls. \"Where am I?\" Shadow asked. \"In the earth and under the earth,\" said the buffalo man. \"You are where the forgotten wait.\" His eyes were liquid black marbles, and his voice was a rumble from beneath the world. He smelled like wet cow. \"Believe,\" said the rumbling voice. \"If you are to survive, you must believe.\" \"Believe what?\" asked Shadow. \"What should I believe?\" He stared at Shadow, the buffalo man, and he drew himself up huge, and his eyes filled with fire. He opened his spit-flecked buffalo mouth and it was red inside with the flames that burned inside him, under the earth. \"Everything,\" roared the buffalo man. (loc 450) The writing is so wonderful...Gaiman so obviously loves his task. Here Shadow is learning more about the world of the gods. the voice spoke once more, as if it were addressing a class, saying, \"These are the gods who have passed out of memory. Even their names are lost. The people who worshiped them are as forgotten as their gods. Their totems are long since broken and cast down. Their last priests died without passing on their secrets. \"Gods die. And when they truly die they are unmourned and unremembered. Ideas are more difficult to kill than people, but they can be killed, in the end.\" (loc 1176) Then there are short sentences that stopped me: \"Chicago happened slowly like a migraine.\" (1417) And the essence of it: \"When the people came to America they brought us with them. They brought me and Loki and Thor, Anansi and the Lion-God, Leprechauns and Cluracans and Banshees, Kubera and Frau Holle and Ashtaroth, and they brought you. We rode here in their minds, and we took root. We traveled with the settlers to the new lands across the ocean. \"The land is vast. Soon enough, our people abandoned us, remembered us only as creatures of the old land, as things that had not come with them to the new. Our true believers passed on, or stopped believing, and we were left, lost and scared and dispossessed, to get by on what little smidgens of worship or belief we could find... (loc 2489) There is so much here for an interested reader, much more than I can possibly tell. If you have an interest in myths, fables, old religions and new story telling, this book may well be for you. I know it is not for everyone but those who love it, do love it. It did win me from a position of like to admire to love by the end. Thank you Mr Gaiman. ...more", "Title": "American Gods"},
