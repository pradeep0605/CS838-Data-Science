I'm going to work my way through some of the popular New Adult books and see if I can weed out the crap and hopefully find some surprising gems. Here's hoping! Just a quick warning: this book has a fair bit of sex in it and so I will be talking about sex in this review. Maybe don't read this if sex talk makes you clutch your crucifix in horror or, you know, combust. I've been reading quite a few indie novels lately; some were good and some not so good . But I've remained safe from anything outrageously bad until now. <+++>The Edge of Never</+++> is one of those books which has a crazily high average rating, it is a \"New York Times, USA Today, and Wallstreet Journal bestselling blockbuster\" and it managed to offend me at least once in every single chapter. I found it to be a mere step away from Beautiful Disaster in the misogyny department and what it lacked in that area was made up for in the extremely bad writing. Honestly, it was so bad it was kind of hilarious. I finally feel that I have read enough to safely make the claim that this \"new adult\" genre thing we've got going on now basically, well, sucks. It seems to be a combination of all the annoying, cliche elements of the young adult genre and a bunch of sex scenes and/or coarse language. In terms of the writing, this book is pretty awful. The author seems to favour certain words for a short period of time to the extent that they appear in every other sentence and then switch to a new favourite and the pattern repeats. Some writers have that annoying habit of telling rather than showing but Redmerski does something that I found much worse - she shows, then tells. She uses body language to express certain emotions but insults the reader's intelligence by adding the tells afterwards. I opened the book again just now to find an example and came across one on the second page; this is by no means the worst but hopefully it will help express what I mean: \"Cam,\" she says, cocking her head to one side to appear thoughtful. But there's no need for me to get nitpicky about language. This book provides much more glaring problems. Like the fact that every girl/young woman in this book is called a slut except the protagonist. If you wanted to play a drinking game with this book, you would only need the word \"slut\" to get completely trashed. \"Slut\" is even used twice in chapter one. In fact, I wish I'd counted how many chapters didn't use the word slut; I can certainly guarantee it would be fewer than how many did. Camryn (MC) talks about her ex as \"the jerk who cheated on me with some red-haired slut\" and her best friend (lol jk) is constantly called \"slutty\" and is only there so Camryn can compare the two of them. Natalie is promiscuous where Camryn is a good girl, Natalie wears revealing clothing where Camryn likes her pastel cardigans, Natalie thinks about sex where Camryn muses about life, the universe and everything. And what a lot of it comes down to: I hated Camryn.<---F> Absolutely hated her</---F>. I put this quote in my status update but here it is again so we can all marvel at the stupidity: Instead of sitting around dreaming up new sex positions, as Natalie often does about Damon, I dream about things that really matter. What the air in other countries feels like on my skin, how the ocean smells, why the sound of rain makes me gasp. When I read that, I did some weird combination of eye-rolling, cackling laughter and general despairing that so many people are happy to buy into Camryn's philosophical bullshit. Camryn, you're not deep, you're a fucking moron. A misogynistic, holier-than-thou moron. And then, of course, we have the real reason this book is a bestseller. Andrew. I get it, actually, I really do. He's gorgeous, he's sexy, he likes to talk all naughty, he loves to go down on you and doesn't ask for anything in return, in fact, his mission in life is nothing more or less than to make you come. I know why you ladies all love this and at least he's not Travis screw-loose Maddox. But he comes with his own set of problems too and, even if he didn't, he still wouldn't be anywhere near hot enough to make up for the rest of this mess. One thing that I suppose comes down to my personal taste in guys and how they speak to me is lines like this: \"if you were to let me fuck you, you would have to let me own you.\" I mean, is this hot to you? For me, it's somewhere halfway between gross and hilarious. But each to their own, I guess. To be honest, a lot of the sex scenes that I assume are supposed to be knicker-twistingly hot just made me laugh. Camryn faces deep moral struggles with the P-word, which she later hilariously overcomes (view spoiler) [\"lick my pussy, Andrew; goddammit, lick my fucking pussy!\" (hide spoiler) ] This is apparently a word that she associates with porn stars, something which leads into an interesting conversation where women are split into two groups - the slutty kind that are only good enough to give a guy head, and the unslutty kind that are worth more. Here's the quote: \"Well, when... Dominique Starla,\" he picks the name from the air, \"does it, it's just to some random guy lookin' to get off behind a keyboard.\" His green eyes fall on me. \"that guy's not dreaming about anything with her except her face in his lap.\" Then he looks back at the road. \"But when someone... I dunno... like a sweet, sexy, completely un-slutty girl does it, the guy is thinking about a lot more than her face in his lap.\" Ugh. No more words on that. I just... can't. I think I've had enough of talking about this book. But one more thing I will say is that part of the reason I kept reading was because so many reviews promised a big heart-breaking twist towards the end. Well, maybe I've been watching Sherlock too much, but I saw it coming a mile off. Just sayin'.

What an unexpected journey and an amazing read!! After receiving about a million messages telling me that that I absolutely HAD to read this next, I started reading it late last night and ended up staying up reading ALL night and finishing it around 5am! Kept me totally riveted! This book is a beautiful story about friendship and love, of living in the moment, living life to the fullest, being true to yourself and not being afraid to reach for your dreams. \u201cWhat compels any of us to do the things we do when deep down a part of us just wants to break free from it all?\u201d Cam is tired of the monotony of her life. She wants more but just isn\u2019t sure exactly what is missing and is open to possibilities. When her old life falls apart, she decides to get a change of pace and hops on a Greyhound bus with nothing but essential necessities ready to see where life will take her. This is where she meets Andrew. He\u2019s so similar to her and yet so completely different. Intriguing. And they decide to join up and go on a road trip together. But he\u2019s got a secret and as they bond over the course of their journey, and fall in love, it has the potential to either tear them apart or cement them together. \u201cI think when you fall in love, like true love, its love for life. All the rest is just experiences and delusions.\u201d I know a some people have said that the beginning of this book was a little slow, and I\u2019ll admit that it wasn\u2019t a fast-paced thrill ride or anything, but personally, I really liked that part. Maybe it was because I knew something \u2018exciting\u2019 was coming, but I liked how the story took its time to familiarize you with the characters. It was a quiet build up and honestly, I enjoyed its pacing. The book wrapped me up in Cam\u2019s adventure. I found her journey liberating even just as a reader. And when Andrew came onto the scene, I fell in love. Guys, he has a crooked smile, dimples, tattoos and is pretty badass in a fight. Oh, and he calls her \u2018babe\u2019. Be still my heart!! <3 I enjoyed watching Cam and Andrew slowly building their friendship, establishing trust, getting comfortable with each other and bonding despite being complete strangers. \u201cThe heart always wins out over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets in the way.\u201d The book is told in alternate POVs but it starts out primarily from Cam\u2019s POV. And it isn\u2019t until 16% that we get Andrew\u2019s. I really liked this because by that time, I felt very connected to Cam and was totally ready to get in Andrew\u2019s head. And as the book went on, the POVs got progressively more entwined and the switch happened progressively more frequently mirroring their growing bond. I was originally planning on only reading half of it last night and saving the rest for the morning, but when I got to the 49% mark, HOLY HELL!!!!! The book just took this AMAZING turn. I mean, I was enjoying it before but then it was just WOW WOW WOWWWW!!! It didn\u2019t matter that it was 2:30AM, suddenly I was WIDE awake and RIVETED to the page!! The questions came flooding in. I started forming dozens of theories. I needed to know more. To get answers. To figure Andrew out! \u201cI don\u2019t know how I got myself into this, but I do know that as much as my conscience is ripping into my fucking ears, telling me to leave her alone, I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to. We\u2019ve already gone too far.\u201d ~Andrew I was squirming, fanning myself, blushing, flipping pages like crazy!! There was this intensity to them. It was quiet at first but it just didn\u2019t stop building. It was like this perfect puzzle with a key piece missing. Something just wasn\u2019t quite right but you didn\u2019t know quite what it was. And the confession scene just phenomenally written. I was right there in the moment with them. Totally wrapped up in their story. I did have my suspicions about the big secret but when everything finally clued in for me at 90%, my heart. just. DROPPED. By 92%, all my suspicions had all been confirmed and I was FREAKING out! The ending was just amazing, incredible, perfect. WOW. Totally beautiful! I don\u2019t want to give it away, but just take heart, there IS an epilogue! \u201c\u2026dwelling and planning is bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cYou dwell on the past, you can\u2019t move forward. Spend too much time planning for the future and you just push yourself backwards, or you say stagnant in the same place all your life.\u201d His eyes lock on mine. \u201cLive in the moment.\u201d This book really drives home the message of how important it is to live in the moment, to follow your heart and not waste a precious second of your life. \u201cI wanted to say thank you.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u2026 \u201d\u2026 for making me feel alive.\u201d\u2026 \u201cWell, everybody needs help feeling alive again every once in a while.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she says seriously\u2026 \u201cI didn\u2019t say again , Andrew; for making me feel alive for the first time.\u201d And can I just say that I absolutely LOVE the \u201cNew Adult\u201d genre. It truly rides the line between a bit of the YA emotional \u2018feelings\u2019 and just enough Adult heat to keep things spicy. I totally loved this and would highly recommend adding it to your TBRs!

Poignant...BEAUTIFUL. This is a story of friendship... This is a story of LOVE... This is a story of serendipity... and a story of moving on, letting go, and living life...Living life in the NOW . This is the story of Camryn and Andrew [image error] \u201cHave you ever wondered what it would be like to backpack across the world?\u201d \u201cJust you and a backpack with a few necessities. No bills. No getting up at the same time every morning to go to a job you hate. Just you and the world out ahead of you. You never know what the next day is going to bring, who you\u2019ll meet, what you\u2019ll have for lunch or where you might sleep.\u201d Camryn , once the outgoing girl that she was, has become an uptight girl because of her parents' divorce, her older brother, Cole, going to jail, and the death of her boyfriend. She doesn't feel free. After an unexpected incident that happened when she and her best friend Nat went clubbing, she decided to leave North Carolina and go on to God-knows-where. Enter Andrew Parrish , gorgeous green-eyed hottie who she meets at the bus, and carries the same emotional baggage as Cam's. From then on, a friendship (or more?) has developed, they have been inseparable on embarking the journey of life...and LOVE. What I love about this book is that the characters are likeable. They have been fighting their own demons but I admire how strong and laid back Andrew is. I've been reading so many books with asshole heroes and I'm so glad that Andrew isn't one of them. He's F-U-N, outgoing, a gentleman, sweet and all! It's safe to say he's PERFECT. He made Camryn open up and relax and just enjoy life. He lets her do things she hasn't done before. He makes her feel alive. This book also has alternating POVs but I love Andrew's POV better. Also, I think the author is a FANGIRL, which explains all the celebrity references: i.e. Damon is far from looking like white trash\u2014he could be Alex Pettyfer\u2019s younger brother. \"...the guy looked like the lovechild of\u2026Adam Levine and\u2026, she twirls her fingers around above her head to let another famous example materialize on her tongue...Jensen Ackles...\" \"I don\u2019t listen to Justin Bieber or that crazy meat-wearin\u2019 bitch...\" \"She and I went to school with Shay Mitchell and Hayden Panettiere, Megan Fox was prom queen, Chris Hemsworth was prom king.\" \"And then there was Natalie\u2019s worst enemy, a cheerleader who tried to steal Damon away from her in tenth grade; Natalie said she was the slutty version of Nina Dobrev...\" Hihi. LOVE these lines. Anyway, I don't think I can continue writing this without giving away too much so, I'll leave you with scenes to look out for: *Cam and Andrew's first meeting *Andrew to the rescue *Their witty banters and crazy convos. My fave --> (view spoiler) [ We head over to the medicines and there\u2019s a middle-aged couple standing in front of the cough syrup, reading the labels. Andrew says casually, without lowering his voice, \u201cBabe, did you find that yeast infection stuff?\u201d My eyes spring open and I freeze in front of the Tylenol. He removes a small box of Advil from the shelf. The couple pretends not to have heard what he said, but I know they heard him. \u201cI mean are you even sure that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the itch?\u201d he goes on and I\u2019m literally melting from the heat in my face. The couple does glance over this time, covertly. Andrew is grinning his ass off at me from the side, pretending to be reading labels. I want to smack him, but instead, I play him at his own game. \u201cYeah, baby I found it,\u201d I say as casually as he had. \u201cWhat about you? Did you see if they have extra-small sized condoms?\u201d (hide spoiler) ] * CAMRYN'S ADMISSION/CONFESSION * THE LETTER!!! AND THE EPIC ENDING. I have a lot of fave lines, but I'll leave you with this one from Andrew: \"Just that dwelling and planning is bullshit,\" he says. \"You dwell on the past, you can\u2019t move forward. Spend too much time planning for the future and you just push yourself backwards, or you stay stagnant in the same place all your life.\" His eyes lock on mine. \u201cLive in the moment,\u201d he says as if making a serious point, \u201cwhere everything is just right, take your time and limit your bad memories and you\u2019ll get wherever it is you\u2019re going a lot faster and with less bumps in the road along the way.\" Some of you might ask, \"Does this book have HEA?\" Tell you what, GO READ IT AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELVES . I promise you, it's worth it ;) Overall, this book made me laugh, CRY (ugly crying), and fall in love. This is the type of book that will leave a mark to your heart.

And look at that cover! Damn gorgeous! Eeeep! Best. Fucking. Book. Ever.! ~Full review to come~ Okay, before I get into this review because I am still a bit mind and emotional fucked right now, I have to say....when I first saw the blurb and the cover for this book, I knew...I KNEW I would love this book. The cover spoke to me and I was instantly drawn to want to read this book. I thought it wasn't coming out til next year but oh my fucking god, when I found out it was out, I was ALL OVER this baby...like a baby on it's mommy's nipple. I was like \"GIVE ME THIS NOW!\" So I bought it, of course I was finishing another book at the time so that I could give this book ALL of my attention. When my gals recommend a book and hound and hound and hound and demand and demand some more (hint hint Sylvia) I KNOW it's a must-read book! The cover, being such a cover whore that I am I was instantly in love with this book. I mean, look at it. Gorgeous...beautiful...PERFECT. Then to add the blurb...oh yes, gimme gimme gimme gimme! Put a perfect cover with a perfect blurb together and what do you get? A FUCKING MASTERPIECE. Yep, that's what I got. I was never disappointed. OH. MY. GOD. Okay, okay I know, I am babbling too much...like a psycho and y'all are thinking \"shut the fuck up and get on with the review dumbass\" and so I will before my resolve slips and I break down and fall apart all over again. So we have <---C>Camryn Bennett</---C>(I wonder if she's related to Josh Bennett?? haha), a 20 year old who is fed up with her monotonous regular going-nowhere life where she works at a department store. Her boyfriend Ian died from a tragice car accident while they were in high school, her parents divorced, her brother Cole went to prison for killing a man during a drunk accident, and her best friend since second grade accuses her of being a lying bitch(in which I wanted to slap across the face...hard). So basically her life is shit. She decides it's time to quit living for everyone else...and start living for herself. And so she does. She sets out to leave North Carolina on a road trip to Idaho(because they are known for their potatoes, which was freakin hilarious how that happened and now when I buy Idaho potatoes, I'll forever think of Cam). When she gets on a bus and starts her new found self-discovery...everything changes. Andrew Parrish is 25 and on a road trip from Texas to see his dying father in Wyoming. He is reluctant to go because he knows that saying goodbye would make this real and it hurts him in the worst way. So, reluctantly he heads out on a bus to face reality...and pain. Little do they know, Camryn and Andrew meet on the same bus...for the same reasons-not sure what they want from life but knowing they want something more than what they're getting now. And so their journey together begins when they meet on the infamous bus and the infamous road trip to Never.... \"Finally, an under-populated bus I might actually get some deep sleep on. It's all I really want to do. The longer I stay awake, the more I think about all of the things I don't want to think about. I don't know what I'm doing, or where I'm going, but I do know that I want to do whatever it is and get there soon. I doze off after staring out the window next to me for an hour. Muffled headphone music blaring right behind me wakes me up sometime after dark. At first, I just sit here, hoping maybe he'll notice the top of my now fully awake head bobbing over the seat and decide to turn the music down. But he doesn't. I lean up, reaching back to rub a crooked muscle in my neck from sleeping on my arm and then I turn around to look at him. Is he asleep? How can anyone actually sleep with music blasting in their ears like that? The bus is pitch dark except for a couple of dim lights shining down onto books and magazines from above the passenger's seats and the little green and blue lights at the front of the bus in the driver's dashboard. The guy sitting behind me is covered by darkness but I can see one side of his face lit up by the moonlight. I contemplate it for a second and then push myself up with my knees on the seat and I lean over the back of it, reaching out and tapping him on the leg. He doesn't move. I tap him harder. He stirs and slowly opens his eyes, looking at me with my stomach hanging over the top of the seat. He reaches up and pulls the earbuds from his ears, letting the music funnel from the tiny speakers. \"Mind turning it down a little?\" \"You could hear that?\" he says. I raise a brow and say, \"Uhhh, yeah, it's pretty loud.\" He shrugs and thumbs the MP3 player for the volume button and the music fades. \"Thanks.\" I say and slide back down in my seat. Okay, that was long and for some reason I was compelled to type all of that. But that was Cam and Andrew's first encounter. And I think it was absolutely amazing and meaningful. Haha, yeah I'm nuts. But seriously this book had me up and down and on turns after turns and more turns with them that I was not sure where up or down was anymore. I was not sure where I was anymore. I absolutely LOVED EVERY MINUTE of this fabulous joyride. I for one love roadtrips. This book made me want to get in my car, drive to a bus station and ride until I was beyond lost. I can't describe my feelings for this book. I just, I am so lost right now. This book made me FEEL every emotion-good or bad that the characters felt and then some. Right now, I am bawling again, just thinking about this experience I shared with my friends. I loved it. Camryn. She was fantastic. The kind of girl that everyone would want to be friends with. She's smart, witty, funny, sarcastic(which probably goes with witty), sweet, caring and just plain amazing. I loved her character-especially when she starts to come into her own and become herself around Andrew. I love her sassy side and the side that she initally shows us eventhough she is trusting, she puts up a barrier-to protect herself, which I can completely understand her reasoning. Then once she realizes Andrew's intentions, she puts them down and lets him in. I loved her romantic side too. Once she feels comfortable, she really laid it on thick....my God, she shocked me but in the best way. I was happy to share this journey with her. She's very likeable and relatable. Ahhhhh, she's just.....amazing! Andrew. Oh my sweet sweet sexy Andrew Parrish. I can't even think of the right words to describe him. He is just the most amazing guy I've ever gotten to know. He reminds me of my Joshy Bennett and that's why I've taken to him so fast and hard. Seriously, his sweet and caring side was truly incredible. I loved his fierce protectiveness of Cam. Though some may refer to it as a crazy jealous side, but I see why-and once the readers read into it more, the more they'll understand as well. There is NOTHING and I mean NOTHING.....I didn't like about him. He's so irresistable from the start-from his sarcastic dirty mouth(which I happen to love by the way) to his sweet soulful understanding side. I loved every minute I spent with him and like Cam, it was hard NOT to fall head over heels in love with this boy. He rocked my world....in EVERY way, and yes....the naughty way too. I loved how we got both POV's. Honestly, we NEEDED both pov's to relate better to both characters. Jessica did a remarkable job of developing the story from the beginning to the very last page. I noticed alot of people felt the story was dragging in the beginning. I didn't feel that way one bit. I loved every second of every page of every minute I spent with these two. I love road trips so I never got bored...but always wondering where their next stop would be or where they were headed next. Once they got off the bus and both went on the road trip to Never-together by car, I was so giddy with excitement. I felt like I was in the back seat and experiencing this whole trip with them. It was AMAZING! Just to get on the open road and go....who the fuck does that? Boy this book sure made me want to do it now. Damn, why didn't I think of that when I had the chance? LOL The relationship. First, I was glad it wasn't insta-love...or at least in the sense of \"Oh you're hot, I love you let's get married and have babies and run away together\". It was never like that. I felt this friendship turned romance really developed slowly and just right. I was glad Cam had kept her wall up for awhile....long enough to make us squirm and say \"Okay, now let's move on, we know you love each other-QUIT STALLING....YOU'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH\" because at least it wasn't a quick one two three thing. It would have lost the appeal then and wouldn't have been as exciting or intense. As it was, I started to get frustrated with both of them for ignoring their attraction. But once things started to take a turn....OH MY GOD. I was so excited and giddy and squealing like a teenager. Perfect. \"OK, defenses are back up. Bring it on. I snarl over at him, crossing my arms. \"First off, I don't listen to Justin Beiber. And second, Gaga isn't so bad. Playing the shock-value card a little too long, I admit but I like some of her stuff.\" \"That's shit music and you know it.\" he replies and shakes his head.\" \"Classic rock is where it's at,\" he says matter-of-factly and then gazes out ahead. \"Zeppelin, the Stones, Journey, Foreigner.\" He lets his head fall to the side to look over at me again. \"Any of that ringing any bells?\" Ahhhhh, a man after my own heart. He likes the shit I love. Yes, Journey, Foreigner and the Stones...some of my faves. I'm an 80's music freak! I love you Andrew. \"What's your name?\" he asks, setting his drink on the grass. I wonder if I should give him my real name. \"Cam.\" I say, settling on the short version. \"Short for what?\" I didn't expect that. I hesitate, my eyes trailing, \"Camryn.\" I admit. I figure with all the lies I'm going to have to keep track of, I might as well be truthful about my first name at least. It's one less-significant piece of information I don't have to remember to keep under wraps. \"I'm Andrew. Andrew Parrish.\" \"So how old are you?\" \"Twenty-five,\" he says. \"What about you?\" \"Twenty.\" \"Well, it's good to meet you twenty-year-old Cam short for Camryn heading to Idaho to see her sister who just had a baby.\" Sigh. I love you Andrew, God damn he is perfect. And he's from TEXAS....which is where I live. Ahhhh, I want to go stalk him. Wait, what? He's not real? HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT. *hands cover mouth in bafflement* Andrew moments: \"She wasn't shy to tell me to turn my music down, with a snippy-ass attitude at that. She got pissed when i accused her of havinf Beiber Fever (it pisses me off that I even know what the fuck that means-I blame that on society) and I get the feeling that she would have no problem kicking me in the nuts if I touched her in an inappropriate way. Not that I would. Hell no. But it's good to know that she's the type. Hell yeah, I like this girl.\" \"If you were going to let me fuck you, you would have to let me own you.\" \"A woman who knows what she wants sexually and isn't afraid to express it is so fucking hot, Camryn-Tell. Me. What. You. Want. Or, I won't give it to you.\" OH. DEAR GOD. *fans self* \"I absolutely fucking melt when she looks up at me like that. How would I ever say no to her? Whether is was about sleeping next to a pile of cow shit or under a bridge overpass next to a homeless drunk-I would sleep anywhere with her.\" \"I kissed you because I wanted to,\" I say. \"I want to do everything with you, Camryn. Trust me! In just a few days I've managed more positions with you than there are in the Kama Sutra. I've wanted to-.\" I notice I'm white-knuckling the steering wheel.\" \"Don't lie to me, baby, did you get hurt anywhere? I swear to fucking God if you did I'm going after them.\" \"Just pretend you're my girlfriend, at least that way no one will fuck with you, or they're less likely to try, anyway.\" Okay, I could go on and on. And more likely the best quotes from Andrew are toward the end but I my nook is dying and going through it right now is not a good idea I should have highlighted them. Moral of this review is.....READ THIS BOOK. Seriously. It will make you laugh, cry, swoon, gasp, FEEL and most of all.....LOVE. This is one story that will stay with me forever-and beyond. I love Cam and Andrew and never will forget their beautiful magical story for as long as I live. The end. Oh my God, the ending will have you hyperventilating and grabbing your stomach from the painful bomb that drops from under you. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE ARE YOU TO STOP READING......KEEEP READING. I PROMISE IT WILL BE WORTH THE PAIN AND DEVASTATION AND ANGER AND ANGUISH. Please.....PLEASE KEEP READING UNTIL THE LAST PAGE. There aren't enough stars in this world to give this book....I would give it infinite and beyond amount of stars. BRILLIANT. FABULOUS. PERFECT. UNFORGETTABLE. MUST-READ!

The kind of book that brings out emotions in me that I love to and need to feel. I'm an angsty book fiend. I get complete joy out of reading books that move my heart and soul. It ROCKED MY WORLD!!!! Honestly this is one of the best books I've read this year...hands down!!!! It started out slow but ended with a HUGE, MASSIVE bang! Every freaking second was electrifying. If I had to sum this book up I think it would be THIS [image error] Life is so short! Live it, love it and enjoy it. You never know when it's going to be your last and tomorrow is not guaranteed. We're not always in control of our circumstances but we have some control over our destinies. We have the power to live a full life no matter how long or short that life happens to be. Cameryn is unhappy with her life. She's had nothing but one bad thing after another come at her. Her boyfriend and love of her life died in a car wreck, she has a brother that\u2019s in prison for a drunk driving accident that killed a person. Her mother and father have gotten a divorce and she has had a massive argument with her best-friend. She\u2019s depressed and needs to get away; to escape her problems and her life. Depression is pain in it's purest form and I would do anything to be able to feel an emotion again. Any emotion at all. Pain hurts, but pain so powerful that you can't feel anything anymore, that's when you start to feel like you're going crazy.\" ~~ Cameryn She hops on a Greyhound bus that\u2019s headed to Idaho. It\u2019s a spur of the moment decision. Andrew is boarding that same bus but is headed to see his father in Wyoming who is dying of a brain tumor. After noticing a weird pervy old guy on the bus checking Cameryn out Andrew feels his protective instinct take over and starts to watch out for her. That leads to some small talk between the two of them and they slowly build a budding friendship. They\u2019re both on separate journeys but their road trips land up merging together and the story that follows is absolutely beautiful. \"I was taking the long road and Camryn was taking the road to nowhere and it just so happens that they led to the same place.\" ~~ Andrew Cameryn and Andrew are incredible together. Its so cliche to say but they really do complete each other. I loved the dynamics between the two of them. Andrew pushes Cameryn to be fearless and to own her sexuality and thoughts. He encourages her to be herself. To never deny how she feels. He helps her work through the things that are troubling her at home. They fall in love magically. It\u2019s romantic and sweet. They\u2019re fun together and I love the way they look at life and embrace it. They\u2019re both like two puzzle pieces that fit perfectly. \"For the first time in my life, I've felt whole, alive, free. You were the missing piece of my soul, the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins.\" ~~ Andrew There is so much more to this story that I just can't go into with out giving it away. I hate spoiler reviews. I think you need to experiences this book with no expectations. It's remarkable how gratifying it is to read. \"THE HEART ALWAYS WINS out over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets it's way. The mind may be what's best, but I don't give a shit what my mind is telling me anymore. Right now, I just want to live in the moment.\" ~~ Andrew The end of the book...WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE!!!! It was..... WOW WOW WOW WOW Prepare to cry, bawl, and sob. Not just little sniffles here and there, I\u2019m talking about full blown body rocking sobbing. The kind of sobbing that leaves you feeling brain dead when you\u2019re done. This book was emotionally one of the most intense books I have read. You fall so in love with the characters that you feel it all, EVERY.LAST.EMOTION!! I can\u2019t say it enough. I loved this. I loved, loved, loved, loved, loved this. This book was incredible. Please read it. Give it a try. I know there are a lot of books out there but I can tell you that I think this book is a soul satisfying book. It will leave you feeling incredible :) This is a picture of Andrew and Cameryn that Drita Kinic found. I thought it was perfect.

Then we have the hero: Andrew whatshisface If you were to let me fuck you, you would have to let me own you. \"And you loved her?\" Camryn looks over at me, letting her head fall to the side. I keep looking at the stars. \"Yeah, I loved her, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\" I\u2019m wondering why she wants to know this; most girls I know snap into that jealousy-fueled mood-swing stuff that makes me want to cover my nuts when it comes to talking about exes. \"Two years,\" I answer. \"The break-up was mutual; we started checking out other people and I guess realized we didn\u2019t love each other as much as we thought we did.\" \"Or, you just fell out of love.\" \"No, we were never in love to begin with.\" Were you or were you not in love with her?? GOD!!!!!!!! The writing! Please, someone get this author a thesaurus! \"Oh, come on!\" she urges, practically begging. Then an aggravated line deepens around her snarling nose and she thrusts my hand into hers and pulls me towards her. \"Stop being a baby! If anybody knocks you over, I\u2019ll personally kick their ass, alright?\" Damon is grinning at me from the side. \"Fine!\" I say and head out with them, Natalie practically pulling my fingers out of the sockets. He practically died when I said that I\u2019d listen to Pink over The Rolling Stones, any day. I mean, I literally think I wounded him. He put his big hand over his heart and threw back his head in devastation and everything. It was very dramatic. And funny. I tried not to laugh, but it was hard not to when his hardened, over exaggerated face was practically smiling, too. This book was ridiculously boring!

Why did you like about The Edge of Never? Just as one student begins to answer, everyone else jumps in and begins to exclaim their feelings of enthusiasm over the book. For those of you who haven't read Edge of Never , let me think about what I could say to help you decide whether or not you want to read this book. There were : Girl smirks. A long road trip, both on a bus and in a car. Incessant gesturing. Some awkward sentence structures. Dual PoV's which are often hard to distinguish as individual. A respectable slow-build relationship which switches into unexpectedly hot territory without warning. A genuinely moving look at personal loss and the comfort that people can find in one another. Some downright sexy and eye-raising cunninninnninningulus (FFS, I can't spell that word, but I did laugh at Urban Dictionary's definition). An ending which did make me sniffle a little. I didn't hate this book like I thought I might. Honestly. I did not love it, but I liked it okay. This might not be the first time where I've mentioned that a story has split personalities, but this might be the most accurate description for The Edge of Never . The first half is a slow build. Did this slow build serve a purpose? I will hesitantly say yes. Most relationships aren't as believable if you don't give characters time to bond. Unfortunately, bonding while discussing today's pop vs. yesterday's classic rock isn't really a big grabber, story-wise. I also hated the pre-bus part of the story. The friend was an idiot who only served as a vehicle to get Camryn the heck outta dodge. I think the friend story line is going to turn some people off from continuing on with the book, and they might end up missing out on something that they would enjoy because of it. The second half is one part WOO HOO SEXY TIME, one part HOLY CRAP, THAT CAN'T BE GOOD, one part HERE'S WHERE WE COMPROMISE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO, and one part HERE COMES THE ANXIETY. I admit to being a little confused over the entire \"own me, I like it rough\" conversations. I'm all for people admitting their desires and fetishes, but there was no real completion to this angle. We saw genuine desperation that bordered on obsession (which didn't bother me for once because I felt the pain and desire in what was implied), but other than talking about \"needing to be owned,\" we never saw this couple explore that part of their inner workings to the degree which I was expecting after the conversation came up. I went from thinking that this book would be a \"sweet\" romance to thinking that it was getting downright kinky after a scene which came out of NOWHERE. By the time we got to the end of the book, I was half-hoping that Cam and Andrew were going to break out into hardcore BDSM territory. Okay, so it wasn't actually going to go there, but what was UP with some of those teasing conversations? This book had a better second half. If you struggled like me with the first half, I'd say to keep going, because we get to something eventually. The ending could have gone either way and I would have been fine, but given Cam's earlier experiences, the ending that was chosen seemed fitting. I thought the (view spoiler) [baby thing (hide spoiler) ] was not needed though. That tipped the scales over into \"too much\" territory. Love Story - Okay Construction/Timeline of Events - Very Poor Emotional Pull - Great Likability of Main Characters - Okay Steam - Very Good (on the explicit end for NA) Cheese Factor - Average to Poor (some phrasing made me cringe) Clinginess - High (tread carefully if you aren't a fan, but I felt it fine/appropriate for this particular story) Fans of emotional love stories will want to add Edge of Never to their list. If you can handle a slow-starting book, the end will reward you with a fine payout.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more 5+ Unforgettable stars!

Original Review (with some added images) 5 epic stars!!! I do believe that this book is tied with TSOT for my favorite book I've read this year... I loved it that much ! The heart always wins over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on it's own always gets its way. Rarely can a book make me grin like an idiot, swoon, laugh my ass off and go from sobbing to tears of joy in a matter of pages. This book was a beautiful and emotional journey. Not just for Cam and Andrew, but for the reader as well. I am pretty sure any review I write will not give this book justice (You just have to read it for your self!) But I'll try. There was no logic or any sense of purpose except that I knew I had to so something other than what I was doing, or I might not make it through this. Camryn had a lot going on in her life. Her high school boyfriend was killed in a car accident two years ago and she has never truly moved on. Since then, her parents have divorced, her brother had been sent to prison, and she just got in a huge fight with her best friend Natalie. She has to get away. Go anywhere except where she is. She goes to the counter of the bus station with just her minimal belongings and the clerk is eating a potato... which makes her decide to go to Idaho. The bus makes many stops along the way, one just happens to be Kansas where Andrew Parrish boards her bus. Its a blatant fact: Andrew Parrish and I were meant to meet on that bus in Kansas. Coincidence is just a safe conformist for fate. Andrew Parrish has a father who is dying of cancer in Wyoming. He also has a lot going on in his life. When he first sees Cam he feels something for her instantly. She notices his piercing green eyes and sexy tattoo's (love the story of his tattoo on his ribs) and they develop a friendship. Once in Wyoming, it\u2019s time to part ways. But they don't. Andrew is very protective of Cam and after an incident in the bus stop they decide to travel together to wherever they feel like going in his dad's chevelle. They end up in New Orleans and stay for a while, then eventually to Texas. Some of my favorite scenes/quotes: \"TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL! Be honest with me, with yourself!\" \"I want you dammit! The thought of you leaving and never seeing you again tears-me-up-inside! I can't fucking breathe without you!\" \"SAY IT! JUST SAY IT!\" \"I want you to own me. I belong to you Andrew Parrish. I want you to own me\" And some funny ones... There were too many of these to list! So basically you won't be asking me to suck your dick for five hundred dollars or anything like that?\" And in the pharmacy at a local Walmart... \"Babe, did you find that yeast infection stuff? I mean are you even sure thats whats causing the itch?\" \"Yeah baby I found it. What about you? Did you see if they have any extra small sized condoms?\" Camryn and Andrew's story is unforgettable! There wasn't anything about this book I didn't love. Camryn was super likable and Andrew was fantastic. You really pulled for them and on top of the drama and laughter there were a few pretty hot scenes. The last 10% or so was really intense. Not gonna lie- It had me ugly crying... in the break room at work, yeah. Andrew's letter... be prepared to sob (view spoiler) [ One more thing: don't feel bad for not telling me that you loved me. You didn't need to say it. I knew all along that you did. (hide spoiler) ] A truly beautiful story about living every moment in your life to the fullest and finding the person you are meant to be with! I know I will have to read this book again!

About halfway through (48% to be exact), the book jumped up and yelled, \"Here I am!\", doing such a 180 that it made my head spin! Did he really say...did he just...did she..what...huh...what the hell?! Am I reading the same book? This is where I started to feel like a thirteen year old girl in sex ed who can't bring herself to say the word S-E-X. I giggled, I blushed, I slapped my hand over my mouth so hard I got whip-lash! What they did! What they said ! This is when my highlighter came out and I started typing like a maniac! Everything from this point on shocked the hell out of me. It was the shock factor that finally won me over. It came out of nowhere in every sense of the word. I spent the whole second half waiting for the bottom to drop out. I finished the last page not being able to think about anything, but Andrew and Camryn. I tried to watch TV...Andrew and Camryn. I tried to read another book...Andrew and Camryn. I finally had to go to sleep thinking about nothing, but Andrew and Camryn. This book baffled me. I absolutely did not like the first half, but somehow, someway I was infected and the story completely got under my skin; taking on a new direction that shocked me into submission. The beginning...the end. They were two halves of a completely different coin. I definitely feel like I had to pay a price to get to the end. However, at the end of the day...I'd pay that price again.

Not sure what to do with her life, she decides to run away from home and to breek free from the everyday life she's leading.. \"So often I sit around and think about life and wonder about every possible aspect of it. I wonder what the hell I'm doing here. Yesterday I thought about why I felt the need to get up at exactly the same time as the day before. Why? What compels any of us to do the things we do when deep down a part of us just wants to break free from it all?\" So Camryn decides to take a bus to anywhere, just to get away from it all. And on that bus is where she meets Andrew Parrish. A tall guy with stylish, short brown hair, green eyes, TATTOOS and most importantly an incredible sense of humor (his inner monologues really made me laugh-out-loud sometimes!) Oh and he also plays the guitar! (What's not to like, right?). Together they decide to take a journey on the road to nowhere. But really, what they do, is take a journey on the road to everywhere... Along that journey they teach eachother about life, love, friendship and about so much more. \"I was taking the long road and Camryn was taking the road to nowhere and it just so happens that they led to the same place.\" While reading this book I laughed, I cried and I sighed over how wonderful a guy Andrew really is. I went through all the emotions Camryn and Andrew went through and I enjoyed every second of it. It was a remarkable journey, one that I would advice anyone to go through. So to everyone who hasn't read it yet, I would say: TAKE A SEAT, BUCKLE UP AND JOIN CAMRYN AND ANDREW ON THEIR JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE !!! (and grab a box of tissues while you're ahead because you're going to need them...) What this book thaught me is to not dwell on the past and to live life to the fullest because you never know what the next day might bring. \"Dwelling and planning is bullshit. You dwell on the past, you can't move forward. Spend too much time planning for the future and you just push yourself backwards, or you stay stagnant in the same place all your life. Live in the moment where everything is just right, take your time and limit the bad memories and you'll get wherever it is you're going a lot faster and with less bumps in the road along the way.\" I definitely loved reading this book and I hope everyone else enjoys it as well!!! Some more pictures that remind me of Camryn and Andrew and their amazing journey: Camryn and Andrew Andrew His guitar Their love Favorite quotes: \"The heart always wins out over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets its way.\" \"If you were to let me fuck you, you would have to let me own you.\" \"A woman who knows what she wants sexually, and isn't afraid to express it is so fucking hot, Camryn- Tell. Me. What. You. Want. Or, I won't give it to you.\" \"Just because one person's problem is less traumatic than another's doesn't mean they're required to hurt less.\" \"Two people unable to cry finally cry together and if the world ended today, we would be fulfilled.\" 5 BRILLIANT STARS!!!! ...more Spoiler Free Review -A MUST READ 5 BIG BOLD SHINING STARS!!!

I\u2019ve known you for a short time, but I feel like I\u2019ve known you forever.\" ~Andrew Some books rise above others. PERIOD. They take you on intense heartfelt journey's that will stick with you for forever. This book accomplished that and then some. The Edge of Never will cause readers to look at their lives knowing that all things are possible. And that you should never conform to the standards set by people/the world. Life is more than your customary daily routine. You just need to step outside of the box. Break your regular rituals and do something different. Live in the moment! 'This is your life.' ~Inner monologue of Camryn When 20yr old Camryn Bennet feels her life is becoming a repeat of the same old things everyday of the week. She makes a spontaneous decision by packing a bag, buying a bus ticket and allowing her gut intuition to choose her destination. Following pure instinct to control her destiny she crosses the path of Andrew Parrish. Andrew shares a similar outlook on life as Camryn. They become friends; both internally fighting the feelings they develop for one another. But we all know in the end...the heart wants...what the heart wants. 'THE HEART ALWAYS WINS out over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets its way. The mind may be what\u2019s best, but I don\u2019t give a shit what my mind is telling me anymore. Right now, I just want to live in the moment.' ~Inner monologue of Andrew Their friendship soon becomes a passionate love affair. Andrew teaches Cam to live in the moment, say what's on her mind, to let down her guard and to try new exciting things. And she does. And in doing so she finds the love of her life. Andrew. Problem is he has a secret. Thoughts The book definitely has a slow build and at one point I remember thinking \"okay, where is this story going?\" All of those doubts I had suddenly took a back seat when the story shot off like a rocket. It left me sobbing hysterically at 3am. I don't want to say more... In fear of giving to much away. So I'll say I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! READ IT! Fave lines said and unsaid 'Never thought I\u2019d intentionally sleep on a bathroom floor next to a toilet while sober, but I meant it when I said I would sleep anywhere with her.' ~Inner monologue of Andrew 'I could die in this bed with him right now, wrapped in his arms and I would never know that I had died.' ~Cam \u201cIf you were to let me fuck you, you would have to let me own you.\u201d ~Andrew \u201cI belong to you, Andrew Parrish\u2026 I want you to own me\u2026.\u201d ~Cam My Ratings Characters- Lovable and Witty Writing Style- Excellent, very Solid, sometimes Intense Storyline/Plot- Highly Emotional, Honest and Thought provoking Steam Factor- High/Very Steamy Overall- I LOVED IT! IT'S A MUST READ!!!! Now go forth and read. Then come tell us about it on Goodreads! ...more For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve felt whole, alive, free.

(though I wouldn't mind taking her place, no problem....keep that in mind, Andrew <3) So, meet Camryn , a girl who \"used to be fun and outgoing and used to run naked into a freezing lake every winter\" , who has suffered the kind of tragedies in her short life that most of us probably don't go through in our entire lives. Depressed, numb, and fed up with the monotonous rut of life, she feels compelled by an urge to just pack her bags and take off to anywhere as long as it's away from the life she's living.......... THE DAY WHEN EVERYTHING changed. And this is their love story. This is the story of their journey into the wild, free LIFE ! The story of discovery of life in the 'NOW' ! \"Dwelling and planning is bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cYou dwell on the past, you can\u2019t move forward.

Any theories of your own, people? :) There were hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments like: -- (view spoiler) [ We head over to the medicines and there\u2019s a middle-aged couple standing in front of the cough syrup, reading the labels. Andrew says casually, without lowering his voice, \u201cBabe, did you find that yeast infection stuff?\u201d My eyes spring open and I freeze in front of the Tylenol. He removes a small box of Advil from the shelf.

I want to smack him, but instead, I play him at his own game. \u201cYeah, baby I found it,\u201d I say as casually as he had. \u201cWhat about you?

They get schooled by each other and LIFE. Two people unable to cry finally cry together and if the world ended today, we would be fulfilled. Letting go has never been so beautiful before....Tissues anyone? Together they learn the beauty of the rain..... And the magic of lying under the stars....... Together they learn to sing along in this journey called LIFE..... It was the kind of Love that keeps you going no matter what kind of war is raging around you..... It had beautiful moments. It had funny moments. It had painful moments. It had moments where I could deeply identify with the beliefs presented. It had crazy moments. And in the end it was ALL WORTH IT!! \u201cHave you ever wondered what it would be like to backpack across the world? Just you and a backpack with a few necessities. No bills. No getting up at the same time every morning to go to a job you hate. Just you and the world out ahead of you.

Anyone care to join me? :D ) As Hunter S. Thompson rightly said: The Edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. So, read the book to know the edge of love, the edge of pain, the edge of life and the edge of never....... In the end...... \u201cI don\u2019t think you ever really fall out of love with someone. I think when you fall in love, like true love, it\u2019s love for life. All the rest is just experience and delusions.\u201d Diving off the edge of never....into forever....together.....

The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets its way.\" I love this quote from the Edge of Never because it's SO true! The Edge of Never turned out to be every bit as good as I hoped it would be. I'm still trying to process all my thoughts and feelings about this book but one thing's for sure, I've NEVER enjoyed getting to know two characters more than I did Andrew and Camryn. They owned me from the first page to the last. They're beautifully flawed, real, and immensely lovable. The author captured their essence brilliantly. I did have a few problems with the story though. Not only did the pacing drag a bit here and there, but I felt somewhat manipulated by the book's climax. That said, I've NEVER enjoy the journey of two characters more. The ending was perfect and just what I needed; and though I finished this book feeling exhausted, I also felt elated. I definitely enjoyed this read. November 29th edit: Over the past few days I have revisited some of my favorite passages in this book. I really do love so much about this story that even with those reservations I discussed in my review, I own this book at least another half star. ...more I always thought depression was so overrated, the way people toss the word around (a lot like the L-word that I will never say to a guy again for as long as I live). I never like to see someone hurting, but I admit whenever I heard someone play the depression card, I'd roll my eyes and go about my business. Little did I know that depression is a serious disease. Sometimes you read a book that is so bad, it actually becomes entertaining. After a pretty awful day, I decided to read The Edge of Nev I always thought depression was so overrated, the way people toss the word around (a lot like the L-word that I will never say to a guy again for as long as I live). I never like to see someone hurting, but I admit whenever I heard someone play the depression card, I'd roll my eyes and go about my business. Little did I know that depression is a serious disease. Sometimes you read a book that is so bad, it actually becomes entertaining. After a pretty awful day, I decided to read The Edge of Never thanks to all the god awful reviews. Needless to say, the only reason I got this book is because it was free. Thank you, shop that was closing down and was giving copies away. Camryn is a fucking idiot. There's no nicer way to say it. She thinks every girl who isn't her is a slut, every man who she doesn't fancy is a rapist and believed depression was something people made up for attention. By page five, I'd rolled my eyes hard enough to irritate a nerve, thanks to little gems like this: Instead of sitting around dreaming up new sex positions, as Natalie often does about Damon, her boyfriend of five years, I dream about things that really matter. What the air in other countries feels like on my skin, how the ocean smells, why the sound of rain makes me gasp. 'You're so deep, Camryn' Damon always says. I must be pretty deep, too. I wonder about things like why dogs smell like dogs and if they smell different in other countries. When Camryn's best friend's boyfriend, Damon, forces himself upon her, and when Camryn does the right thing and tells Natalie, her best friend, she is accused of being a \"lying bitch\" and told never to contact her again... So she decides to do the most mature thing ever and run away, destination unknown, on a bus without telling anyone. Because, apparently, running away from problems that aren't so problematic if she actually talked to people is the answer to everything. The Edge of Never is a good example of interesting plot but executed awfully with terrible characters and terrible writing. He looks gently offended I'm quietly stunned He points gently He is softly amused My mouth parted with an offended spat of air We both laugh gently My face sours delicately It's very much like the author just randomly picked out words from a hat, jumbled them together, and hoped they made sense. Well, they don't. Stop it. Not only is the writing pretty bad, but the love interest? He's the creepiest fuck I've ever had the displeasure to read about. The kind of guy who has been talking to Camryn all of FIVE MINUTES, and thinks she is his \"property\" and \"territory\". I resist the urge to watch her, noticing how soft and innocent she looks, which makes me that much more primal, more protective. The pervert seems to have stopped watching her when he saw us sitting together inside the last terminal. In the eyes of men, he probably sees her as my territory now, my property. The kind of guy who thinks this is hot: \"If you were to let me fuck you, you would have to let me own you.\" The kind of guy who takes stalking to whole new level : \"When you were in the bathroom the next morning and I gave you two minutes to get ready...\" \"Yeah, I remember. What did you do?\" He smiles nervously. \"I sort of took a picture of your driver's license with my phone.\"[...]\"I just wanted to make sure I knew how to find you again,\" he confesses. And of course, instead of running for the hills, Camryn thinks that is the SWEETEST, MOST ADORABLE THING EVAAAA!1!!!!1!ONE! Camryn is the sort of cute you want to high five in the face with a shovel. Andrew is the sort of hot you want to roast on a BBQ, not sleep with. Speaking of sex, the scenes were incredibly cringey and awful. \"Lick my pussy! Goddamnit, Andrew, lick my fucking pussy!\" And, of course, there is a TERRIBLE tragedy, because it wouldn't be cheap, \"heartbreaking\" New Adult without a tragedy, amirite? I mean, what happened to HEAs? And OF COURSE the TERRIBLE TRAGEDY is easily resolved in like two pages and everything is fine and dandy, which really begs the question: what was the point in including it in the first place? It was really sickening, actually, how Andrew didn't tell Camryn he had a tumour and might die. That was the most selfish thing I've ever heard. She only found out when he had a goddamn seizure. What the fuck? That's romantic, not telling someone you're dying, that you have cancer? Well done on being a Class A Dickwad, Andrew. Really.

To say I was disappointed wold be an understatement. Typically I try to write spoiler free reviews, but I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to do that with this one, so consider this your warning! (view spoiler) [ First of all, let me start with what I did like. I liked the characters that Redmerski has created here. Both Cam and Andrew were wonderfully written and I really didn't have any issues at all with them on a character level. I actually sort of liked Cam's strength and Andrew's sweetness. And I really liked them together. Unfortunately that might be where it ends for me. I get that this book is about strength and loss and how we move on with our lives and become who we were meant to be, but I don't know what about this just rubbed me the wrong way. Cam decides to up and leave her hometown for Idaho (because she sees someone eating a potato). So she boards a bus hoping to find herself. She's lost her boyfriend in a car accident, her parents divorced, her next boyfriend cheated on her, and then her best friends boyfriend hits on her and her BFF doesn't believe her and basically tells her to f*#k off. What had me puzzled from the get go, was the weird 'the worst is going to happen' attitude the characters seemed to have. While at a club with her friend, Cam has a few drinks and goes to talk with a guy she met and her immediate reaction was OMG what if he rapes me. Then, her BFF's boyfriend comes to her psuedo rescue (that she didn't need) and beats the crap out of the guy telling her he could have raped her.... then proceeds to attack her while telling her he has been in love with her for years. O_o has she been so unobservant ... has he hid it that well? ANYWAY.... This all culminates in Cam's fleeing by bus. She meets the one and only Andrew Parrish on his way to visit his dying father in a hospital in Wyoming They slowly bond over the trip and eventually are set to part ways, but this happens right around the time she loses her confidence in being able to do this on her own. And low and behold some scumbag comes and tries to attack her... but our swarthy hero Andrew happens to save the day. From there she spills about the fact that she wasn't visiting Idaho for the reason she said and so begins than epic roadtrip of sorts. They fight their attraction for each other, Cam, because she isn't sure what she wants and Andrew... well, we don't really know his hangups yet. He refuses to spill. ok... so at some point Cam, who is 20, divulges that she is sexually submissive...and Andrew... well, of course he's sexually dominant. I don't even know why that is in this story to be honest. I get exploring sexuality and trying to find who you are, but that just seemed to be thrown in there as a plot point that made no sense what-so-ever to me. Also, Andrew seems to have some rage and anger management issues. She, Cam, seems to find this sexy and this also confused me. All of this isn't what really bugged me... what did it, was the fact that over what I think was like 3-4 weeks of this road trip, Redmerski finally divulges Andrew Parrish's big secret. And it's that he has what he thinks is a terminal brain tumor. Please tell me how it's possible that he had absolutely no symptoms of this tumor that he's known about for 8 months over the last few weeks and then suddenly he's dying... I'm not buying it and I couldn't seem to get past all the predictable plot devices used in this story to truly just enjoy it. (hide spoiler) ] Even what was supposed to be a heart wrenching end, was unfortunately, predictable to me, and really just reiterated that there really wasn't anything that stood out in this story for me. I'm struggling to understand if it's just me in regards to this book, because I see all the raving reviews, but I don't know if it's because people just really love Andrew and that makes everything that bugged me about the plot and such okay or what... but to be honest, that wasn't enough for me. Andrew is absolutely sweet and swoony and really helps Cam find herself along the way, but I couldn't overlook all the other things in this story that were predictable and really bothered me to give this a higher rating. If you're looking for a coming of age story and don't mind a somewhat predictable plot with a big bow at the end ... this might be for you.

Here are some quotes that made me want to chuck my Kindle against the next-best wall: '\u2026 and then Christian Deering, my Ian rebound guy, and the jerk who cheated on me with some red-haired slut.' Of course the girl he cheated on you with has to be a slut. What else? 'She [a receptionist at a motel] pulls it [Andrew\u2019s credit card] from between his fingers and all the while watches every little move his hand makes until it falls away from her eyes down behind the counter. Slut.' Well. So it is completely okay that you are eyeing Andrew like a piece of meat all the time but as soon as another girl does it she is automatically a slut? Nice. \"'Have you ever had a one night-stand?' [\u2026] 'Well, I was just wondering\u2026because I've never done something like that.' 'Why not?' he says so casually. [\u2026] 'Well, it's kind of slutty, I guess.' [\u2026] 'If a girl did that a-lot,' he draws out that word with a squeamish smile, 'then it would be slutty, sure. Once or twice, [\u2026] there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.'\" Hach. How I love this. As long as you have one or two one-night stands, that's okay. But hey, three times, and you're on your way to slutty-town. Newsflash: If a girl is comfortable with having one-night stands and exploring her sexuality, she is completely fine to do whatever she wants to do. It\u2019s nobody's business. Oh, and let me guess: You probably don't feel like the same applies to guys, huh? \"'No, I would never think you were a slut unless you went around screwing a bunch of guys, for which I then would be in jail because I would have to beat the fuck out of all of them [\u2026].'\" Yes! Violence!! And again talk about what makes girls sluts. (You might have noticed it is a recurring theme.) And that ending? I call cop-out! Also: *gag*.

She is tired of trying to live up to everybody else\u2019s expectations and just decides to pack up her stuff and take a bus to somewhere, anywhere. Andrew\u2019s dad is busy dying and he needs to go visit him. He wants time to clear his head so he ends up on the same bus as Cam. \u201cI was taking the long road and Camryn was taking the road to nowhere and it just so happens that they led to the same place\u201d This isn't one of those love stories where the guy and girl are in each other\u2019s arm in the first chapter. In fact the first half of the book is quite slow. Cam & Andrew meet on the bus, but are both quite guarded. They both promised themselves that they won\u2019t fall in love. After chatting on the bus together, Cam starts trusting Andrew. He saves her from a near incident and she agrees that it is safer to travel with him than on the bus, and so the road trip continues in his car. [image error] \u201cIt\u2019s a blatant fact: Andrew Parrish and I were meant to meet on that bus in Kansas. Coincidence is just a safe conformist for fate.\u201d Andrew forces Camryn to live a little and gets her to try new stuff, talk about her past, wishes for the future and sexual desires. They share these experiences together and Camryn feels alive, really alive, for the first time in her life - they sleep under the stars, perform together in a bar, lie in the rain ... [image error] She even gets enough courage to ask Andrew about a one night stand, but he refuses\u2026 \u201cI say that I\u2019m not into you like that, Camryn, because\u2026 because you\u2019re not the girl I could only sleep with once.\u201d \u201cIf you were to let me f*ck you, you would have to let me own you.\u201d [image error] Slowly, they start falling for each other, but they are both still trying to fight it for their own reasons. \u201cHow can two people who are undeniable more than just attracted to one another not give in?\u201d When an event that takes place that affects Andrew deeply, he evaluates the relationship between them and forces Camryn to do the same: \u201cBe honest with me. Be honest with yourself !\u201d His hands wave outward toward me in gesture. \u201cCAMR-\u201d \u201cI want you, goddammit!\u201d I scream at him. \u201cThe thought of you leaving and never seeing you again tears-me-up-inside !\u201d My throat burns like fire. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking breathe without you!\u201d \u201cSAY IT! Son-of-a- bitch ,\u201d he says, exasperated, \u201cjust say it!\u201d \u201cI want you to own me!\u201d I can hardly stand on my own anymore. Sobs rock my entire body. My eyes sting and my heart hurts like it never has before.\u201d Camryn has revealed everything to Andrew.. her past and her true feelings for him, but it appears like the honestly is not mutual. She gets the feeling that Andrew is keeping something from her. What will happen when she finds out what it is? Will she be there for him? Will they overcome it together? The end is extremely emotional \u2026 I cried like I have NEVER cried for a book before in my entire life. There were sad tears and happy tears. The letter just pushed me over the edge.. I was crying so loud my husband came to check up on me. I\u2019m not going to give the ending away, but this book is totally worth it. Don\u2019t be afraid of the tears \u2013 I can guarantee you, that you will love this book as much as I have. It\u2019s impossible not to! Fav Quote : \u201cI think when you fall in love, like true love, its love for life. All the rest is just experience and delusions.\u201d Soundtrack: [image error] Bad Company \u2013 Feel like Makin\u2019 Love : Andrew listens to it on the bus Bad Company \u2013 Ready for Love : Camryn names the song after Andrew asks her what Bad Company songs she knows and she doesn\u2019t want to say Feel like Makin\u2019 Love \u2026 his reply: \u201c Are you?\u201d :) Rolling Stones \u2013 Laugh, I Nearly Died : The song that Andrew plays in the bar and the first time that Cam hears him sing Kansas \u2013 Carry on Wayward Son : plays on the radio and Camryn correctly (mostly) guesses the name of the song and impresses the socks of Andrew Kansas - Dust in the Wind : they discuss this one in the car as the perfect piece of music for death. He asks her to sing it and she refuses.

Andrew what can I say about him???I absolutely fell in love with Andrew. Even during the first half of the book his POVs were like a breath of fresh air. I was thanking Andrew for the words that start to come out of his mouth!!!And the things he did with that mouth... *sigh* Andrew truly was just a beautiful character.I loved everything he did for Camryn, everything he was for Camryn.I love the people these two characters became when they were together.

Both wrung out by tragedy, both impending and past, they wake up one day and just know that they have to get on a bus to travel. It\u2019s a fatalistic decision that brings them together almost as if it was meant to be as they are both lost in their own lives and misery and they form a blossoming friendship on the bus while they are both trying to escape the events that have mired their lives. The two of them are lost and drifting and they develop a growing connection with one another that neither of them will name nor even admit to themselves, all the time not confronting their issues. It\u2019s at once sweet and sad at the same time as it is sardonic and funny. It\u2019s a surprisingly grown-up romance based, at least for the first half of the novel, on the deliberate repression of sexual attraction and gratification that enables it to exude an emotional intensity so often missing in these types of novel. Real life constantly intrudes on their trip with texts and phone calls from their families and friends and despite all this and their own discernible loneliness, the pair forge a mutual dependence during their roadtrip and reignite feelings they had both long attempted to bury. This is a meaningful and moving romance told with unhurried restraint \u2013 there\u2019s a pleasing shapelessness to it which allows the story to drift and meander slowly, to give time to the slow development of the romance. Their relationship has a tenderness and authenticity to it as it moves on influenced more by what is left unsaid rather than what is actually said. Their understanding, of course, becomes infused by sexual tension and their attachment is sharp and potent and they both try to resist it for the longest time. Both have reasons not to enter into a relationship with the other but everything in their hearts and desires tell them to. When they finally do, their passion burns white hot and their feelings for one another intensify but there is still one further secret to be revealed and, I confess, I cried like a baby. The whole novel is a bittersweet reference to the transience of life and, by the end; I just wanted to hold on to everything and everyone that is precious to me. So, this is a stunning journey of two lost and lonely souls finding each other like Eurydice and Orpheus \u2013 soul mates. It\u2019s a slow, emotional story that allows the central relationship to build believably before the climactic conclusion 4 stars New Adult contemporary romance For more reviews, please visit Sinfully Sexy Book Reviews ...more 5 LOVE STORY STARS...Clearing A Spot on my Favorite's Shelf! \"I was taking the long road and Camryn was taking the road to nowhere and it just so happens that they led to the same place.\" I fell in love with a love story!

He is one hell of a sexy beast who does what he wants and says what he wants. He makes me want to talk dirty endlessly and not feel one bit of shame for it....RAWR RAWR RAWR. Before I continue on with my rant I would love to thank J.A. Redmerski for the opportunity to read this amazing book. I was so delighted and elated when she asked me if I wanted an ARC ecopy of The Edge of Never and I could never decline any book she offers me. I love her style of writing and how raw and honest it is without feeling bashful or timid. She really doesn't hold back at all and I love that. She is refreshing and so humbled, it's really hard to not love her and her books. She is just one of us readers who loves a sexy bad boy, a strong female character and an amazing storyline. Thank you so much and I can't wait to read more of what you have to offer. Okay, so back to the review. The Edge of Never is a simple story about a girl named Camryn Bennett who is in search of something more. Her life, up until now, has been plauged with so much heartache and misery, she feels a need to escape, almost to the point like if she doesn't flee she will drown and suffocate in her own misery. I loved Camryn and her will to just drop everything and leave, just pack a few things in a bag and buy a bus ticket to Idaho because it is home to the spud. Something was calling her to do it and if she didn't she was going to bury herself in the hole that she had surprisingly found herself digging for the last two years. Who could blame her though of everything that had happened up until then, but at least she recognised the sign to just get up a leave. And that's what she did. She found herself sitting on a bus and headed to Idaho. Behind her sat another wounded soul, set out to Wyoming to say goodbye to his dying father. I give you Andrew Parrish...oh my Lord. This guy is everything a girl could ever dream of (and ladies, we have had those dreams). He has tattooes, smoking green eyes, a fit body you will envision yourself wanting to be hovering over you, a dirty mouth *ahem* that can sing also and play the guitar, and a freaking sexy car that will rival Dean Winchesters...RAWR RAWR RAWR. He is your typical alpaha male that will pummel anyone for you, sweet talk his way out of anything but will hold your head over the toilet while you throw your guts out and lie down on the dirty toilet floor with you because you can't move...I'm crying just thinking about him and he literally is one hell of a man that will make you weak at the knees and have you crying out his name from pure pleasure. Oh how I fell in love with Andrew Parrish...le sigh!! It is inevitable that these two hit it off. Their flirtatious banter is remarkable and their underlying attraction to one another is palpable. My heart was flattering and I was literally squirming in my seat and blushing so hard. I was often left breathless and waiting in anticipation everytime they got so close to one another and then one of them would pull back. They both had their own issues going on and you are literally dying inside for them. I was completely frustrated and totally captivated with Cam and Andrew's story. This is a love story like no other and I have to say that going on this road trip with them was the best ride of my life. I really cannot say how much I love them so much and they are my new favourite couple. I loved how they flew by the seat of the pants and went into everything head on and totally fearless, except when it came down to revealing a little bit of their soul to one another. But, just when you think that everything is peachy and going beautifully...then BAM!! I was shocked and couldn't help but cry my heart out. Like Cam, I suspecting that Andrew was hiding something but I never thought in a million years it would be that and my heart was breaking and I just wanted to throw myself down the hole that Cam had been digging for herself before the road trip. OMG Jess, you really know how to scare the living shite out of someone and then you go ahead a make me cry some more...but in the happiest sense *doing a happy dance and gyrating* hehe! I'm telling you all that this book will literally blow your socks off and it is a must read. You will fall in love and invest your soul into Cam and Andrew and their amazing story. You will laugh, you will cry, you will pant and blush and be left needing a damn cold shower that's for sure, and you will be holding your heart in your hand and waiting in breathless anticipation. The Edge of Never is just one of those reads that you wish will go on forever and are sad to know that it's a standalone, which you will revisit time and time again. I love this book and I know you all will too...I know now why J.A. Redmerski has labelled this her baby, cause I sure as hell know she has left her soul hidden within the pages of this beautiful love story. ...more I'm changing my rating from a 5 star to 2. This was my first ever NA read when I was still too young to understand why slut-shamming is wrong, but I remember the emotions! This book makes you feel that's why I still can't rate it lower, but I know that h would piss me off now. I tried to re-read and couldn't. 5 OH, ANDREW!!! Stars I ALWAYS TRUST MY DAUGHTER!

My 31 year old daughter turns me on to the most fascinating NA books, and this one is no exception. Never asking what the book is about, trusting she knows what I enjoy, I went in blind. Within the first few pages, I knew she was right ...... I was going to love it! I know I am really late to the party reading this one, as it has been out for a number of years. But, it is one I will never forget! What begins as a friendship between two 'lost souls' who meet on a bus while traveling the countryside in search of answers, turns into the most compelling and engaging read. I reveled in the journey they were on and simply loved the dialogue between the two as they get to know one another. I love a sweet and sexy romance! Ms. Redmerski blew me away with her writing skills and style, and dual POV's are always right up my alley. Camryn Bennett, twenty years old, is a dispirited soul, still trying to figure out who she is without Ian, the love of her life, who died way too young in a car accident. The cheating rebound guy, her brother in prison, and her parent's divorce just adds fuel to the already depressing fire. She is in limbo land and not in a happy place. To top it all off, she and her best OTT friend, Natalie, have a huge fight involving a boyfriend, and she refuses to see or talk to Camryn. Disillusioned, disappointed and determined to take control of her life and the need to feel alive again, Camryn buys a bus ticket and starts traveling across the country with no real destination in mind. She just knows she has to get away for awhile. Along the way, an incredibly attractive male boards the bus and sits directly behind her. He annoys the hell out of Camryn, but eventually he wears her down, and they become \"traveling friends.\" His name is Andrew, he is twenty-five and is headed to Wyoming to say goodbye to his dying father. He is also trying to figure out the ways and whys of life. Andrew ...... wow ...... how to describe Andrew? Adorably funny, matter of fact and honest to a fault (well mostly, except for one big secret). Sexy would be a total understatement, and he is beautiful, inside and out, with a killer smile and gorgeous green eyes. He is also a bit of a mystery, which just adds more dimension to the storyline. Simply put, Andrew is unforgettable! And because Andrew is absolutely irresistible, fun times are ahead once Camryn finally gives up the fight to keep him at arms length!

If you want to read this book without having it spoilt for you, this is not the review you should be reading. Just wanted to point that out. Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you about The Edge of Never The Survival Skills You Didn't Know You Were Missing that will turn you into a Special Snowflake like our main character, Cam. Survival Skill #1: Slut-Shame-Yo-Self-Through-Life. Look, everyone else is a slut but you. That's just how life is if you want to be a special snowflake. If every other girl is open about their sexuality, they're a slut. If they are dressing too revealing, they're a slut. If they are 40 and just looking at the guy-who-isn't-even-your-boyfriend-but-who-you're-kind-of-attracted-to, they're so a slut. If they have sex too often, they're a slut. But you? Of course you're not a slut. You can dress as revealing as you want to and you're not a slut, you can be open about your sexuality and you're not a slut. You can have sex and you're not a slut because you obviously have not-slutty sex! You can do all the things you want to do and you are\u2014have you guessed it yet?\u2014not a slut! Because you're a special snowflake. Isn't that just awesome!? Survival Skill #2: You are the one to decide what really matters. If you want to be a special snowflake, you must know that everything that matters to you is the only thing that matters . Do you get that? Forget about everyone else's problems, your problems are the ones that matter the most. Of course you must pretend to know that there are other problems, way worse than yours, out there but just when you know that someone is listening to you talking about your much more awful problems. Just never forget that the only thing that matters is stuff like finding out why the sound of rain makes you gasp. Things like that are very important, so don't forget about it. People in third world countries living in poverty and dying because of it? Well, just pretend you know about it but obviously, your problems are way worse than that. Also, finding out why exactly the sound of rain makes you gasp is of utmost importance anyway. Even if you never find out because you're a fucking liar who doesn't even gasp when you hear the sound of rain. :-) Survival Skill #3: Depression is overrated but you are really depressed and not just \"playing the depression card\". Look, since you have the world's biggest problems, you are depressed. That's pretty obvious, so I hope you already know that. Otherwise you don't even have to try to become a Special Snowflake. Anyway, you know that you are depressed and depression to you, Special Snowflake, means: sadness, sadness, sadness. (Princess Special Snowflake's words.) You pretend to feel bad for other people, you pretend that you never liked seeing other people hurting but when you just hear someone \"play the depression card\", you roll your eyes and go about your business. (Princess Special Snowflake's words, who is our main character in The Survival Skills You Didn't Know You Were Missing , which is really obvious. Duh. ) OK? Don't forget that. No one knows what it's like to be depressed but you. Depression means not feeling any emotion at all and, if you want to be a Princess Special Snowflake, you aren't able to cry because you're depressed. That's just what depression does to people, kill all their tear ducts. Survival Skill #4: You want to be pitied but don't know how to achieve that. You have the world's biggest problems and you know it but you also want everyone else to know it and pity you. Of course, if you want that to happen, you have to use the pretend-strategy as much as possible. Play your problems cool, like you don't want to talk about them because if you do, you're a whiner and people like that suck. If a person then asks you often enough about your problems, you give in and tell them but pretend to know exactly that your problems are nothing compared to other people's problems (you don't really think that, though, alright?). You now have reached your goal: people feel bad for you, pity you and think you're such a strong person for just being able to still breathe and keep yourself alive. Good work, Special Snowflakes-To-Be! Survival Skill #5: You made love with your first boyfriend and nothing will ever compare to it. As you all know, no one ever has sex. Oh wait, sorry, let me correct that. The Special Snowflakes never have sex. So you better get used to calling it making love , you with me so far? Anyway, you know your first time making love will never compare to any other experience in your life. But only until you meet the tame version of Christian Grey (we will get to him later), which proceeds to change your whole life. Survival Skill #6: The One . A lesson in love, Special Snowflakes-To-Be. You will meet the one in a bus, going to nowhere exactly. It will be a bus seat. You will have a hard time finding the one bus seat at first because you know, it's the one and it must be perfect. But when you find it, you will be one happy Special Snowflake, I tell you. So then this guy gets on the bus and you must worry instantly if he will find the one as well. If he sits behind you on the one for him, you are relieved and can take a nap now. Survival Skill #7: Everyone loves you. This one's easy. You're one hot blonde white girl. If you're not blonde or white, forget about becoming a Special Snowflake. (Wait, that means that I, Rose, can't become a Special Snowflake either. Sob. Do you hear the tears dropping from my face, and does it make you gasp? OK, that was too much.) You are not a slut but sexy and that's what counts and makes everyone love you. The guy at the bar will start flirting with you, your best friend's boyfriend of five years will punch bar guy's face because that's the intro to him telling you that he had feelings for you, like, since forever and he then will start trying to kiss you without you wanting it, then comes the weird dude in the bus who keeps looking at you and you don't know about but Andrew does. And that brings me to the next Survival Skill: Andrew. The hero of the story. Survival Skill #8: Y'all need an Andrew aka tame Christian Grey. This is where your Special Snowflake life starts to get interesting. This is where your life as Special Snowflake begins . Because this dude is who makes you a Special Snowflake because, well, obviously you won't be Daddy's Girl anymore after meeting him, but you'll be\u2014can you guess it?\u2014Andrew's girl. And that's one of the things that will make you a Special Snowflake in the first place. He is the stranger you meet in the bus and you don't trust him immediately but he wins your trust after a day or so, when he lets you meet his dying father. Girls, don't believe your parents when they tell you not to trust a stranger, there are exception like this one. So if you meet a boy on a bus and he lets you meet his dying dad in the hospital, of course you trust him to not be a \"bad stranger\". Oh, and also, he saves you from being raped from the weird bus dude who kept staring at you, which proves it even more that he's trustworthy. (Of course it wasn't necessary to tell you about the weird bus dude who kept staring at you.) Anyway, you meet him, and your life starts to get interesting. Survival Skill #9: How to live your life like Fifty Shades of Grey is your Bible but you ain't slutty because of living like that. Your Andrew changes your life. He makes you want to have sex with him in ways that you think are slutty but you ain't slutty and he tells you so, so calm down, it's all fine. You'll be giving him a blowjob while he's driving (but in a not-slutty way), you'll be having some tame S&M shit happening in the bedroom motel rooms you spend pretty much most of your road trip in. (Oh, sorry, forgot to mention that, of course you'll stop using the bus for the road trip to nowhere but will trust Andrew when he makes this plan that you go on a road trip with him. Just you, him and his car. Of course, how stupid of me to forget something so important.) Anyway, this will change your life (especially because he has erections that can cut diamonds\u2014his words) and impact your future forever, Special Snowflake. Your Andrew will love you like no one else, especially because a person who truly loves you will punch every guy in the face who just looks at you and well, isn't Your Andrew. Now onto the most important Survival Skills. Survival Skill #10: Sex Ed with Cam. Girls, what do you have to use if you don't really plan on getting preggers? A .) Condoms B .) Birth control pills C .) Other protection (vaginal rings, injections etc.) D .) Some of the things mentioned combined (like condom + birth control pills) E .) Nothing If you choose E .), Princess Special Snowflake is proud that you know how not to get preggers if you don't want to (and also know how to have safe sex!) Which brings me to... Survival Skill #11: You are preggers with the child of the luuuurve of your life! Congrats! You are now a Special Snowflake. ************************************************** On a little more serious note : If you can't tell if I'm serious or not with this (which is OK), I'm here to tell you that I'm not. I didn't like this book. At all. It was quite insulting (especially if you're a victim of sexual assault and/or are struggling with depression, are open with your sexuality etc.) and I hated every minute of it. While I get that you don't have to agree with characters/think their actions are right to like a book, I'm putting all the joking and fun aside and really do hope that no one who read this book (and liked it) approves of any of the messages it is sending out. ************************************************** Can't get enough of The Survival Skills You Didn't Know You Were Missing ? 1.

If we get past the terrible first person present tense writing, the book is still a boring, amateurish effort. Let's start at the very beginning. After I encountered this quote near the start of this book, I knew it would be a tough read for me. Instead of sitting around dreaming up new sex positions, as Natalie often does about Damon, I dream about things that really matter. What the air in other countries feels like on my skin, how the ocean smells, why the sound of rain makes me gasp. Oh shut your face you self-rightous, arrogant ninny. \"Why the sound of rain makes me gasp\"??? WTF! You must be fun to hang out with in a storm. \"Gasp, gasp, gasp\"... And I'll have you know, plenty of my most important thoughts involve new sexual positions. Far more important than what the air feels like in Germany or Chile. (I'll give you a hint... it feels like AIR). Okay, I'm taking a breather. I had a ranty little moment there. On top of a main character that bothered the ever-living crap out of me, I decided to continue on the hopes that this book became great. It didn't. The first 1/2 was impossibly dull. I actually yawned while reading it. And the writing... just super repetitive, simple, anti-engaging stuff. However, as I read on, I kind of found myself being drawn into the story a bit. I started to enjoy myself a fraction and I caught glimpses of what all the hype was about. Then the ending. Melodrama, melodrama, melodrama with a big helping of emotional manipulation. Sigh. So I didn't HATE, hate this one. But I certainly didn't love it. It came nowhere near to living up to the hype. **Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review** **Find this review and others like it at myfictionnook.com** ...more 4 ROADTRIP STARS! \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u201cJust remember to always be yourself and don\u2019t be afraid to speak your mind or to dream out loud.\" I always get a little nervous picking up a book which has been highly rated because I'm a little afraid that I might not enjoy it as much as majority did or the fact that I go in with some high expectations.

Well safe to say, I really enjoyed this read with the whole roadtrip idea, coupled up with a 'strangers to friends to lovers' premise and was close to being a winner for me. Sadly, there was something that I simply couldn't overlook which caused me to deck out 1 star overall :( ******** The Edge of Never is the story of 21-year old Camryn Bennett , whose life seems rather messed up after a string of events starting from the death of her boyfriend to her family problems and the final straw being a huge fight with her best friend, Natalie. Tired of it all, Camryn decided to buy a one-way bus ticket to anywhere as long as she gets to escape the current life she leads. In a fateful encounter on the bus, she meets 25-year old, Andrew Parrish who is planning to visit his dying father in Wyoming. What started out a strangers on a bus turned out to be something more for both of them as they embark on a journey of self-discovery in a roadtrip adventure after a twist of event. ******** The idea of a roadtrip in a book definitely excites me & I can certainly say that I had a really good time reading all the tiny details of each place they visited & the crazy things Cam and Andrew did throughout their trip! I know the pace of the book came off a little slow in the first half and nothing much wow-ed me but I still enjoyed it for the most part. I liked seeing how their friendship slowly evolved and surprisingly, it didn't bother me that it was a slow buildup romance. Usually I take that as a good sign in a book because it doesn't make me want to skip the filler details. \u201cLive in the moment, where everything is just right, take your time and limit your bad memories and you'll get wherever it is you're going a lot faster and with less bumps in the way.\u201d Loved both MCs and I was really happy when we get glimpses of Andrew's POV aside from them being mostly from Camyrn. I felt that it definitely allowed me to connect and relate to their actions , so there was no unnecessary need to feel of frustrated from my end. What Cam and Andrew shared had brought on some beautiful moments and it really gives you something to think about living life in the moment. \u2665\u2665 \u201cThe heart always wins out over the mind, The heart, although reckless and suicidal and masochist all on its own, always gets it way. The mind may be what's best, but I don't give a shit what my mind is telling me anymore. Right now, I want to live in the moment.\u201d And now I reach the dreadful part of my review that explains why I had to deck out 1 star from my rating. I'll put it in a spoiler tag in case anyone hasn't read the book: (view spoiler) [I was really enjoying the read up to the 90% mark until the author suddenly dropped the bomb twist of Andrew having a brain tumor. Just a disclamer: I'm not going to say I'm an expert in this illness but having witness my dad being diagnosed with brain tumor 2 years ago, I can sorta relate to this; so bear with me here. It really didn't bode well with me that the author would downplay the seriousness of a brain tumor event. It is almost impossible that a person suffering from a brain tumor would have the capability to function as well as Andrew did throughout the entire roadtrip, especially if its at a critical stage (I'm assuming the case here since in the book, Asher told Cam that \"the chances of survival were small\"). The brain is literally one of the most vital functioning organ in the human body which has the power to control our emotions/senses/motor actions and a tumor that serious wouldn't have gone unnoticed in his behaviour to outside people. Also it's true that seizures come alongside with the presence of a brain tumor which our neurologist then advised that it would be very unsafe for my dad to drive (other than the fact that the brain tumor made him lose focus easily). And the very fact that Andrew has been driving the entire time (and for long periods of time!) in this book pretty much means that he has been risking both his life and Camryn on the road. Uh so yeah, not sure how I feel about that after the bomb was dropped =\\ The point is: Probably I would have appreciated it better if the author did some research before using brain tumor or any other illness for that matter. To drop a twist like that at 90% of the book killed the entire reading experience for me a little as it didn't made sense to me for what I've just read in the earlier 90% of the book :( I'm sorry but to me, this was something I simply couldn't overlook. (hide spoiler) ] However, I would really like to emphasize that the above point is a matter of a personal opinion and probably had I not know better, I believed I would have loved this read as much as everyone else :) ******** Overall I still enjoyed and loved the read for the most part; it made me smiled, laughed and got me a little teary-eyed as I read Andrew's letter to Camryn. \u201cI think that if past lives are real then we have been lovers in every single one of them. I've known you for a short time, but I feel like I've known you forever.\u201d The ending may have been a little rushed for me, but probably this was done to allow Book 2 to play out more. Well not sure if I'll be reading Book 2 as I glanced through multiple mixed reviews and some DNFs for it. This may be the case of a book better off being a standalone but I can't really judge for sure ;) [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more", "Title": "The Edge of Never"},
