I'm sure it says more about them - poor, unenlightened souls - than it does about me; for some reason, in particular, very few people understand what a wonderful punctuation mark the semi-colon is, and that it can, and very often should, be used to replace the period. Though there is also, of course, much to recommend the humble comma: the average sentence (not that I wish to imply that a sentence should content itself with merely being average) could be much improved by the addition of one or two, possibly more, of these handy little beasts. No, I simply can't understand it; I suppose that a careful reading of Eats, Shoots and Leaves could, if I really tried, help me make my sentences a little longer, and assist me in festooning them with additional, glorious, punctuation.

When I meet a pretty young thing that I might want to break bread with on occasion, I'm filled with anxiety over that first email: will she write in complete sentences with capital letters and periods and paragraphs, or will I be left reading a ton of LOLs and dashes and ellipses? The bad email is going to seriously hamper this relationship. It's with that kind of word nerd superiority complex that I went into Lynne Truss' short book on punctuation. I'm not a stickler, mind, but I do know when things aren't written properly and there are certain crimes against grammar that I just can't abide. Even though I'm sometimes a lazy writer here, I know the problems. I've been known to throw an extra comma where it doesn't belong, and when I'm furiously typing, the \"there\", \"their\" and \"they're\" usage can get hairy. In the last week alone, I've edited recent posts over and over again -- correcting tense and errant apostrophes. Eats, Shoots & Leaves has only succeeded in ramping up my snobbery and intensity. I politely chided a friend in the comments of a post because she had made a grammar error and she didn't even catch it. That riled me up even more. It's driving me crazy that some old entries in here imported funny and now there are question marks masquerading as apostrophes and single quotes (not to mention the number of dead links, but that's more web nerd than parts of speech geekery isn't it?). Even now, I'm obsessing over whether I'm using punctuation correctly in this piece. I've got two hyphens impersonating a dash and I've got colons and semi-colons up there that I'm pretty sure I'm using the right way but can anyone ever be completely sure? Sigh. But, yes, I'm a snob. My blogroll is filled with bloggers who are actually writers or aspire to be. If you're going to use words, I want you to have a way with them. I love that most of you understand the importance of setting off proper titles of books and films (whether it be in quotes, italics, or the web person's favorite: the bold) and that you probably are wondering whether or not the period or question mark goes inside or outside the direct quote marks. Ms. Truss makes me feel a little stuffy about caring about such things but there is definitely a comfort in knowing I'm not alone. I appreciated most the history of punctuation she peppered throughout the book along with her very dry British humor and the delight with which she plays with her own writing, saving the colon and semi-colon until she is actually talking about them; keeping the hyphen and dash under-wraps and then exploding with them at the perfect time. If you're a word nerd, you must read Eats, Shoots & Leaves. ...more This is a delightful screed on the demise of punctuation in contemporary expression. Truss bemoans the loss of knowledge or of interest in proper use of language. Truss is a Brit and the usages have not been modified for the American edition of the book. A must and an enjoyable read for anyone who cares about our language, for any reader. In addition to gripes about the slovenly way that we write, Truss offers some history on punctuation.

I could probably write a book of equal length (a fluffy and yet tedious 204 pages) going into what a disorganized mess this book is, but I'll spare you. Instead, here are three reasons why you should save yourself the criminal $17.50 this book costs. First, Truss comes across as such a pretentious, self-important jerk that it makes the reading often unbearable. Take this little nugget from page 104: \"To this day I am ashamed of what I did [her response to a pen-pal, both in eighth grade:] to Kerry-Anne (who unsurprisingly never wrote back). I replied to her childish letter on grown-up deckled green paper with a fountain pen. Whether I actually donned a velvet smoking jacket for the occasion I can't remember, but I know I deliberately dropped the word \"desultory\", and I think I may have used some French. Pretentious? Well, to adapt Gustave Flaubert's famous identification with Emma Bovary, \" Adrian Mole, age de treize ans et trois quarts... c'est moi .\" I don't speak French, and she leaves this line, pretentiously, untranslated, so I'll have to give her the benefit of the doubt. However, she does not seemed to have learned much from this unrepentantly asshole experience (note: she goes on to use poor Kerry-Anne four more times for her examples) because she spends the entire book essentially trying to tell the world what to do. You might wonder to what end. High standards? A love of literature? No, just her own need to sound sophisticated and manage other people's business. She attempts to gloss this over with an ill-fated attempt at humor, which I'll address next. Second, she is just not funny. I generally love British humor and I'm familiar with a fair amount of British comedy movies, shows, and writing. I think she must have produced the least funny attempt at humor in British publication in the last 100 years. Her jokes are based on a shared sentiment of self importance, not joy of the language. Furthermore, she tries to come across as appealing to everyone and treating her targets with cautious respect, but she ends up just taking cheap shots at greengrocers, teenagers, and the illiterate (fear of losing language to the barbarians). That's the sickening part. Couple that with her tedious recurrent references to her being single at at age 48 (at time of press), her lack of stereotypical teenage fun (\"when other girls of my age were attending the Isle of Wight Festival and having abortions, I bought a copy of Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage \"), and her repeat references to the same stale jokes (Sir Roger Casement \"hanged on a comma\") and you get a long, tiring read. Her style is an attempt at tongue in cheek, but she really just can't pull it off. Finally, the book does not even achieve what it aims to. That's impressive for a book pumped ten times the size of its meaningful contents. Truss's real issue seems to be dissatisfaction with lowered standards by the public. She lumps improper punctuation in with poor grammar and phonetic spelling, and in the process she looses sight of her original aim. Poor writing, she assumes, is due to primarily to ignorance; she deplores shorthand writing for text messages, but fails to consider the utility in that context (she doesn't criticize court stenographers using official shorthand). Furthermore, she seems to interpret lax writing as a sign of social, and perhaps moral, decay rather than personal standards for what matters. These days everyone accepts, at least I believe, that the internet is filled with lazy, disorganized writing. I hold most all my own writing to high standards, including this book review, because it matters to me. I don't think it makes much sense or does much good to blow off steam about the masses' lazy writing on the internet. There's no clear thesis and no clear argument. That's the death call for expository writing and defeats the entire purpose of writing the book. The book fails as an educational tool and cannot be redeemed on its humor or otherwise. I've always had high standards with writing (grammar, punctuation, spelling, style), but having high standards is different from being anal. Truss would have benefited from revisiting The Elements of Style (to which she pays a passing nod at the end) and thoroughly edited her book on everything besides the punctuation, especially the organization. Clarity, flow, and interest would go a long way. ...more This is how I know I'm a real English teacher - I have a shelf dedicated to books just about English. The history of English, the uses and misuses of English, and even the history of the alphabet we use. This is something I never expected to have in my personal library, that's for sure. But that's all to be expected; I'm an English teacher, and people like me are supposed to read books like this. It's professional development, or something.

The history of English, the uses and misuses of English, and even the history of the alphabet we use. This is something I never expected to have in my personal library, that's for sure. But that's all to be expected; I'm an English teacher, and people like me are supposed to read books like this. It's professional development, or something. The weird thing about this book, a book dedicated to punctuation, of all things, is that it was popular with people who weren't English teachers. Everyone was shocked by how well it sold, the author included. A book written as kind of a primal stickler scream somehow struck a chord with the general reading population. Perhaps there is some hope for our species after all.... The reason it sold well, of course, is that it's well-written and entertaining to read. Far too many books about language are written by dusty intellectual Linguists who exude smugness with their impenetrable jargon and are completely inaccessible to the general public. I have those books on my shelves as well, and nothing this side of a double shot of NyQuil is as good at getting me off into slumberland. Ms. Truss, however, writes like one of us. She's an ordinary person who loves her language and who just snaps every time she sees a sign like, \"Apple's - $1\". I share her pain. The book is a well-mixed combination of history, usage and style. The tiny marks that make the written English word behave the way it does have come to us along a remarkable number of paths. In the last millennium or so, marks have been added, changed and removed over time as necessity dictated. One of her fears (and the impetus to write this book) is that we may be changing English to a new form that requires less of that rigid, form-fixing punctuation. Or people just haven't bothered to learn. As she notes throughout the book, punctuation is one of those things that few people ever really get to learn. Our English teachers give it a once-over in elementary school, and then we never get a review of it, so we spend most of our lives just throwing around commas and apostrophes and hoping we get it right. More often than not, we don't. And we're afraid to ask anyone, lest we look like ignorant yobs. But to master punctuation means more than just being a pedant and a nerd. Heavens, no. Mastering punctuation means controlling your language, which is controlling your thoughts. The vast difference between a sentence like, \"The convict said the judge is mad\" and \"The convict, said the judge, is mad\" should be enough by itself to illustrate how important proper punctuation is. In a language like English, so dependent on rhythm, timing and stress, punctuation is the substitute for our voice. It tells us when to speed up and slow down, which points need to be stressed and given special attention, and which points (like this one) can be safely disregarded, if one so chooses. It would be very easy for Ms. Truss' obvious frustration with the misuse of punctuation to overwhelm her and poison the book. Admittedly, she does at one point put together a kit for those who would be punctuation guerrillas and risk prison to set the world straight, but by and large she stops short at advocating actual lawlessness. Ms. Truss understands that punctuation abuse isn't something that people do intentionally - it's largely a matter of ignorance, and she wants to help. What's more, she's funny. For example: In the family of punctuation, where the full stop is daddy and the comma is mummy, and the semicolon quietly practises the piano with crossed hands, the exclamation mark is the big attention-deficit brother who gets over-excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly. Every section in the book has sharp and clever humor, a description of something as simple as a comma made in such a way that you find yourself laughing out loud on the train. So, if you've always wanted to know about how to use a semicolon, or you're not sure if your commas are in the right place, or if you've ever driven someone to madness by dropping an apostrophe into a possessive \"its\" - and you know who you are - then this book is the one you need. Enjoy. ...more Delightful book. Have enlisted for the corps.

I have the same feeling about \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s\u201d. I vividly recall learning English grammar at school. It was exceedingly painful at the time, because the teacher was rather boring and this carried over to the class. Yawning was very common then too. I remember how correct usage of the apostrophe was always rammed down our throats. Now, with the internet, correct punctuation appears to be taking a back seat. From the first page this was indeed a thought-provoking book. I loved the author\u2019s punchy style but I was intrigued first of all to find out from where the title originated. A reference to this was made earlier on in the book: \u201cTrue, one occasionally hears a marvellous punctuation-fan joke about a panda who [my addition - shouldn\u2019t this be \u2018which\u2019 because a panda is not a family pet?] \u2018eats, shoots and leaves\u2019\u2026.\u201d So on checking the acknowledgements I see that Nigel Hall was responsible for this. After a certain amount of research, I assume this is the joke? It\u2019s rather good anyway. \u201cA panda walks into a restaurant, sits down and orders a sandwich. After he finishes eating the sandwich, the panda pulls out a gun and shoots the waiter, and then stands up to go. \u201cHey!\u201d shouts the manager. \u201cWhere are you going? You just shot my waiter and you didn't pay for your sandwich!\u201d The panda yells back at the manager, \u201cHey man, I am a PANDA! Look it up!\u201d The manager opens his dictionary and sees the following definition for panda: \u201cA tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterised by distinct black and white colouring. Eats shoots and leaves.\u201d Ms Truss starts with the unfortunate apostrophe. She just sees glaring errors everywhere: on buses, billboards, in newspapers, public institutions like the British Library, you name it, there are errors everywhere. As an example, a headline in the paper states: \u201cDead sons photos may be released\u201d. How many sons are there one wonders? When Ms Truss was on Radio 4 making a series of programmes about punctuation, she met John Richards from the Apostrophe Protection Society. Imagine that. The apostrophe has become alive and finally reached \u201canimal\u201d status. The author questions: \u201cWhy did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing? Could I start one? Where do you get balaclavas?\u201d It continues in this style, attacking all those who misuse commas, full stops (period US), semi-colons, etc. It's all an outrage to her and she throws in wonderful anecdotes to illustrate her point of view. Under commas, I especially liked the Oxford comma. A typical example was \u201cThe flag is red, white, and blue.\u201d The comma after white; in Britain, we normally leave it out but there are those who prefer to leave it in. I suppose this is somewhat pedantic? Or, A woman, without her man, is nothing. A woman: without her, man is nothing. It\u2019s remarkable really how the comma can actually change the sense of a sentence so dramatically. I confess that I\u2019ve never really thought of that before. When we arrive at the semicolon, there\u2019s a very good example with George Bernard Shaw. I agree with Ms Truss, we would obviously look on his use of this punctuation as sheer insanity but he\u2019s dealing with T.E. Lawrence, who he refers to as \u201cLuruns\u201d (sounds like a place to me as we have \u201cLaruns\u201d not too far away from where I live in France). Mr Shaw believes that Lawrence is a liar: \u201cYou will see [writes Shaw] that your colons before buts and the like are contra-indicated in my scheme, and leave you without anything in reserve for the dramatic occasions mentioned above. You practically do not use semicolons at all. This is a symptom of mental defectiveness, probably induced in camp life.\u201d Ms. Truss laments on the arrival of the e-mail and the vocabulary that has come into being because of that. She blames the internet for all the books on line and wonders if the book will still be around in twenty years. She also makes references to the printed word: \u201c\u2026The book remains static and fixed \u2026 Holding the book, we are aware of posterity and continuity. Knowing that the printed word is always edited, typeset and proofread before it reaches us; we appreciate its literary authority. Having paid money for it (often), we have a sense of investment and a pride of ownership, not to mention a feel of general virtue.\u201d Certain sections of the book just show a comma on the line. I rather liked that too; a fleuron of sorts? It\u2019s probably best to pretend that it\u2019s a variation of a flower or leaf. I really could go on about this book but suffice it to say, I just thoroughly enjoyed Eats, Shoots and Leaves. It stands up for punctuation and correct punctuation at that. It\u2019s all part of our heritage and must not get lost in time. It\u2019s also very amusing. All said and done, I recommend this book to everyone, regardless of their age. I'll no doubt go back to it from time to time just to re-enjoy it. ...more I really don't see what all the fuss was about this book--the author didn't seem particularly knowledgeable, and her \"zero-tolerance\" approach seems to do more to promote intolerance than to promote clarity. In particular, her distaste for \"emoticons\" seems entirely inconsistent with her fascination with the origins of punctuation--it's as if she thinks of punctuation as a dead thing that _used to be_ alive, but now she doesn't want anyone to disturb the corpse. I confess: I frequently find myself self-conscious about my use of punctuation. A few years back, I even bought a copy of Strunk and White\u2019s The Elements of Style, but have yet to read more than a chapter or two at a time before discovering something else to do, even if it\u2019s bathing the dog.

Ugh, and see: I'm an ellipses junkie! It's unacceptable, since I am not a famous author who can break the rules with impunity. However, many of the rules of good punctuation use are common sense (at least I think so) and so I think I edge into the stickler zone. It bothers me when grammar and punctuation are mangled, but especially when it's mangled by someone being paid to get it right. Although, even more frustrating is when people defend the mangled \"writing\" as though it doesn't matter at all. Because it does matter. IT DOES. There was some really interesting info in here, and I especially liked the historical info regarding invention and usage of punctuation over time. Good stuff. But otherwise, it was kind of like preaching to the choir. I already appreciate and like punctuation - so really what I got out of this was a history lesson and a future warning that if we continue on our txtbsd way, that our punctuation may go the way of the Dodo bird. Which would be sad... but maybe that day will wait until I either go blind or die. *Fingers crossed!* ...more This book is a witty rant about the use and misuse of punctuation.

We, the readers, of course know how to use apostrophes correctly, and that writing littered with exclamation marks infers a feeble mind. We know subconsciously, even if not via overt rules, how to use hyphens. We pat pat pat ourselves on the back with being so in accord with this funny woman and her nit-picking usage of grammar. Ahhhh, except this is the nub of the thing. Lynne Truss in this book deals only with punctuation - that thin layer of tasty icing on top of the vast, dense, impenetrable cake that is grammar. Reading Eats Shoots & Leaves does not maketh a grammarian of us, but merely a punctuator. Something that most kids do with reasonable efficiency by about the age of 11. Maybe I am being a bit harsh. Ms Truss mentions several famous authors who have tussled with nuances of punctuation, often with ferocity, and there is a bibliography at the end which is over four pages long. Still I can\u2019t help thinking this is the easy-peasy edge of grammar, and really, she is giving us a very cushy ride. Reservations aside, this is an enjoyable book. Ms Truss writes in an endearingly chatty style, and she\u2019s a very amusing woman. I also learnt a thing or two. For me, best of all, was an introduction to the Oxford comma. This is when you are allowed to put a comma before an \u2018and\u2019 when making a list in a sentence. Thus\u2026.\u201cThe fruit salad, of oranges, apples, guavas and tenderly-ripened bananas\u201d is replaced by \u201cThe fruit salad, of oranges, apples, guavas, and tenderly-ripened bananas\u201d. Oh hooray, hooray! I always wanted to insert that last comma, but thought it was forbidden. Other people will undoubtedly find their own unexpected freedoms. For all her huffiness, Ms Truss is a surprisingly generous mentor. All in all this book is a good fun read. The average rating on GR - a nice plump 3.83, from 50,719 people - says it all. -------------------------------------------------------- Note: And for those of us who flail around in the gooey morass of more difficult areas of grammar, help is at hand via this wonderful Goodreads group.

She indicates such use shows poor word usage to convey meaning; therefore, needing to supplement with an emoticon.) Uh-oh. ;-) Each chapter opens with a brief history, current practice in both American and British cultures and some include debates from various groups on correctness. All have humor and examples of right and wrong usage. I have to share this letter. It is on pages 9 & 10 and is the same letter, but the punctuation is placed differently; thus, altering the meaning--drastically. Check it out: Letter #1 \"Dear Jack, I want a man who knows what love is all about. You are generous, kind, thoughtful. People who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me for other men. I yearn for you. I have no feelings whatsoever when we're apart. I can be forever happy - will you let me be yours?

It went something like (and I am the worst person at re-telling jokes, I always forget bits. Usually the punchline): What does an Aussie bloke have in common with a wombat? They both eat, shoots and leaves. Except that's not quite it cause the grammar is off. Never let me tell a joke, I'll always ruin it. Anyway, to the book.

Hilarious, absolutely hilarious. And, as a bit of a \"stickler\" myself, very welcome too. Eats, Shoots & Leaves covers the apostrophe, the comma, the semicolon and colon, the hyphen, dash and bracket, and even the question and exclamation marks. If you have always struggled, or sometimes doubt, how to use any of these, this is definitely the book for you. If, like me, you read it and get awfully chuffed with yourself for using them (almost always) correctly, you'll still want to keep this little gem around, either for back-up in those arguments with other sticklers (or punctuation-impaired people), or for a laugh. It's an easy-going, ironic book, full of tongues-in-cheeks and witticisms and puns - intelligent puns. One of the things I love about this book is how Truss captures the punctuations marks' true characters. Giving marks personalities is a great joy to me - the only reason I used to fly through the times table every morning in primary school was because all the numbers had personalities and characters, and when they times'd by each other it was like a dramatic scene in a play; that was how I remembered it all. I can't say I do the same with punctuation, but I totally agree with Truss' personifications. For example: Now, there are no laws against imprisoning apostrophes and making them look daft. Cruelty to punctuation is quite unlegislated: you can get away with pulling the legs off semicolons; shrivelling question marks on the garden path under a pwerful magnifying glass; you name it. ... the tractable apostrophe has always done its proper jobs in our language with enthusiasm and elegance, but it has never been taken seriously enough; its talent for adaptability has been cruelly taken for granted; and now, in an age of supreme graphic frivolity, we pay the price. [p.36:] And: ... if you feel you are safe paddling in these sparklingly clear shallows of comma usage, think again. See that comma-shaped shark fin ominously slicing through the waves in this direction? Hear that staccato cello? Well, start waving and yelling, because it is the so-called Oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) and it is a lot more dangerous than its exclusive, ivory-tower moniker might suggest. [p.84:] Also: There are times ... when the semicolon ... performs the duties of a kind of Special Policeman in the event of comma fights. ... One minute the semicolon is gracefully joining sentences together in a flattering manner ... and the next it is calling a bunch of brawling commas to attention. [p.125:] I love it! It also does wonders for understanding how to use the fiddly little things, if you've ever had trouble - and let's face it, who doesn't? And while Truss' tone may often be light and playful (even a little frivolous), this book is hip-deep in interesting historical background, usages and common mistakes, and entertaining examples of real-life punctuation boo-boos that, if you care at all, will actually make you tense up in indignation. She also has a friendly dig at Australians and our tendency to turn statements into questions, which the British fans of Neighbours have picked up, much to her chagrin: Increasingly people are (ignorantly) adding question marks to sentences containing indirect questions, which is a bit depressing, but the reason is not hard to find: blame the famous upward inflection caught by all teenage viewers of Neighbours in the past twenty years. Previously, people said \"you know?\" and \"know what I'm saying?\" at the end of every sentence. Now they don't bother with the words and just use the question marks, to save time. Everything ends up becoming a question? I'm talking about statements? It's getting quite annoying? But at least it keeps the question mark alive so it can't be all bad? [p.141-2:] I laughed and laughed. I did feel a bit ashamed when Truss disparagingly brings emoticons into the discussion - I have used a couple of smileys and the like on occassion. But it's not easy getting tone across in written words - or, rather, it kinda is (isn't that what writers accomplish all the time?), but in emails etc. it's more personal, and you can't read body language or facial expressions, and these people you are chatting away to are so often strangers, that it is so easy to be misconstrued, misunderstood, and a whole lot of other \"mis-es\". Another thing I appreciated was that, this book having been written by a Brit, it hasn't been Americanised. That would be a completely different book. But Truss does make distinctions between American and British usages which are very helpful, and interesting too. This book reads a bit like an essay, the kind famous writers write so that we'll all be awed by the intellectual genius behind their Great Works - except Eats, Shoots & Leaves is not at all pretentious; on the contrary, Truss confesses several times that she herself has doubts, and still learns that what she thought was wrong is actually \"correct\" (such as it is). What I mean, is that this is not some dry reference book - and the panda joke on the back cover prepares you for that. Even so, this is perfect reference material for students, teachers, copy-editors, journalists, proof-readers (please!), sticklers and, well, anybody. I learnt a lot from it but had fun learning, which should actually help me remember it all. And I just can't believe I never noticed that the movie Two Weeks Notice doesn't have an apostrophe (which I very nearly typed in myself just now), or that Who Framed Roger Rabbit doesn't have a question mark. I think my brain put them in for me, which is why I'm very surprised to find these punctuation marks are missing. Recommended for everyone, even people who are bored shitless by anything to do with writing. ...more According to Lynne Truss, I'm a \"stickler\". I've been known to spend a good hour or more obsessing over the placement of a comma, a semi-colon, a hyphen, a dash. Are my brackets formed correctly?

I've been told off by my (dyslexic -I really can be an awful person) partner for rearranging his commas when in fact all he wanted to know dammit is if necessary was spelt right (something I'm admittedly rather less certain about than the placement of those poor little punctuation marks). I won't even start on the state of the average Facebook post or blog comment. Besides, Lynne Truss covers it all so well in this book. I no longer feel alone. But seriously now, the poor apostrophe is being so mistreated - can this book be made essential reading in schools? It's fun, easy to read, explains clearly and humourously, and would make far superior reading to most dull textbooks. People might actually start punctuating their ( not \"they're\") sentences in ways that don't make us punctuation sticklers want to weep. I am also very, very aware of the potentially contentious Oxford comma in the previous paragraph - not to mention petrified that in all my above ranting I've left a mark out of place and will rightly be in a great deal of trouble for it later. ...more This is a first book in a while I read in russian.

You may notice that maybe it's not the best idea to read a book about english grammar in russian language. But worry not, I had a really good translation that was created with the help of many educated british ladies and gentlemen; moreover the original quotes were saved in translation and I had a bonus in a form of two phrases instead of one. This book is not a grammar book but an entertaining nonfiction about the most funny misuse of punctuation. As you can see from the title, the original meaning was that panda eats shoots and leaves, but someone misplaced one comma, and the result is drastically changed. We have in russian similar phrase and even a wonderful cartoon \"In the country of unlearned lessons\" about it. There's a difference between russian punctuation and english punctuation, and sometimes when I write my reviews, I find it rather hard to determine whether this comma is ok to use in english as I use it in russian. Well, this book definitely helped me to distinguish some of these rules. It is - to some extent - a depository of different references to world-known classics and how they used punctuation to create their masterpieces. It was, at least, educational information and, at most, spiced with funny examples. But in many ways this book is for huge fans of punctuation. There were times I couldn't really understand the author and her obsessive love with punctuation, and considering the punctuation mark in the wrong place almost an unforgivable crime. Sometimes it was annoying to read all the author's hysterics about misuse of it. Maybe I am wrong and don't get it, but in this case I can freely admit: I don't get all this obsession. But I definitely agree with Lynne Truss in one thing for sure: punctuation, in the first place, must bring the correct meaning to words, and underline emotions and the mood author wants to show to his readers. ...more When was the last time you read a book where you could literally say, \"This book has changed my life.\" Eat, Shoots and Leaves by Lynn Truss is one such book.

I had always assumed an apostrophe was there. Then I started listening to The Plain White T's, a band whose name makes no sense with an apostrophe, and I knew things were getting serious. Nonetheless I will admit that it was a challenge reading the chapters about the apostrophe and the comma (although I have learned a few knew tricks for commas). Then I came to a chapter entitled \"Airs and Graces.\" From there onward, the book was a revelation. I learned my punctuation from my mom and copious reading. I still have a hard time explaining dependent clauses and why it is appropriate to use \"well\" instead of \"good\" even though I can tell when a sentence is complete/written correctly if I can read it. I am sharing this background so that when I say Truss explains all of the punctuation rules presented in her book you will know I mean really clear. Truss has illustrated that there is a time and place for the dash and double-dash in all good literature. She has also shown that, to avoid over-using the dash, a colon can easily replace a dash in certain situations. I never knew that! What's nice about Eats, Shoots and Leaves is that it's not a dry read. Yes, Truss is talking about punctuation. Yes, she is deadly serious about it. But she maintains a sense of humor throughout: including witty examples and poking fun at punctuation (and punctuation sticklers) as much as she explains it. In addition, Truss includes abundant historical information about the punctuation marks she discusses ranging from the first names for parentheses to the first appearance of an apostrophe in printed documents. I would recommend this book highly to anyone with an interest in writing. Even if you know the basics, Truss has a few tricks up her sleeve that are sure to give your writing a little extra flair. ...more I don't think I \"favourite\" many non-fiction books but this book was just brilliant!

It really put things back into proportion for me. \u201cHaving grown up as readers of the printed word (and possibly even scribblers in margins), we may take for granted the processes involved in the traditional activity of reading \u2013 so let us remind ourselves. The printed word is presented to us in a linear way, with syntax supreme in conveying the sense of the words in their order. We read privately, mentally listening to the writer\u2019s voice and translating the writer\u2019s thoughts. The book remains static and fixed; the reader journeys through it. Picking up the book in the first place entails an active pursuit of understanding. Holding the book, we are aware of posterity and continuity. Knowing that the printed word is always edited, typeset and proof-read before it reaches us, we appreciate its literary authority. Having paid money for it (often), we have a sense of investment and pride of ownership, not to mention a feeling of general virtue. All these conditions for reading are overturned by the new technologies. Information is presented to us in a non-linear way, through an exponential series of lateral associations. The internet is a public \u201cspace\u201d which you visit, and even inhabit; its product is inherently impersonal and disembodied. Scrolling documents is the opposite of reading: your eyes remain static, while the material flows past. Despite all the opportunities to \u201cinteract\u201d, we read material from the internet (or CD-roms, or whatever) entirely passively because all the interesting associative thinking has already been done on our behalf. Electronic media are intrinsically ephemeral, are open to perpetual revision, and work quite strenuously against any sort of historical perception. The opposite of edited, the material on the internet is unmediated, except by the technology itself. And having no price, it has questionable value. Finally, you can\u2019t write comments in the margin of your screen to be discovered by another reader fifty years down the line.\u201d First off, my \u201cinner stickler\u201d would like to point out that it should be \u201cCD-ROM\u201d, as it\u2019s actually an acronym for \u201ccompact disc- read only memory\u201d. \u201cInternet\u201d should be capitalized, even though common usage has recently dictated otherwise. Second, didn\u2019t she just write an entire book about how editing itself is a crapshoot and you can\u2019t really put your faith in it too much? We\u2019ve all seen typographical errors in books; even Truss mentions them somewhere around the beginning of the book. However, I think her thesis is sound. We are seeing a general decay, not only in the quality of the language, but in the quality of the minds which experience and produce it. The Internet has many useful research outlets, but for the most part, it goes one step further in making media something which affects us, and not something which we effect. Odd, considering that the entire concept of self-publication should do just the opposite. I wrote a good rant about this once, but I think it\u2019s been lost to the selfsame Internet by which it was inspired. ...more This book was a big deal a while ago, and I was like, \"I am not reading a guide to punctuation written by a Brit.\" Because punctuation works differently over there.

Truss consistently confuses education for intelligence, all but saying the people who get this stuff wrong are stupid, and her tone is so patronizing and self-satisfied it makes me wonder who she thinks her audience is. Did she write this book to commiserate with other grammar snobs about how disgusting the uneducated are? Or did she think she was going to reach the people who genuinely wanted to learn about grammar, teaching them the error of their ways through her superior attitude and half-smothered laughter? Unlikely. So we're back to the idea that she just wants to laugh at them from the safety of a like-minded mob. And then, as if her abhorrent attitude weren't enough, in pursuit of her agenda of shaming everyone who has ever misused an apostrophe, one of her real-world examples includes the n-word, which is completely unacceptable. But apparently in Truss's world, hate speech is funny as long as it has an unnecessary apostrophe in it. Now, I like grammar. I intentionally took three classes on the subject. I wince whenever someone gets the wrong \"your\" somewhere. But I also know that grammar is something that has to be taught and has nothing to do with inherent intelligence\u2014the differences between British and American grammar proves that easily enough. If grammar were an innate quality humans have, it would all be the same. But it's not! It's flexible. And situational. And cultural. And she allows for none of that nuance here.

However I still aim to work on getting all the kinks out so that any 'mistakes' are simply induced from my unique way of phrasing, well, phrases. I wish others around me took the same care because I constantly see mistaken uses of homophones and contractions such as there's theirs; there and they're; and its and it's. In fact I tend on the whole to often humorously correct such misspellings and incorrect uses of language procedures. For instance earlier I commented on how I hate how fair evaders always avoid carnivals and good looking people. And that is why I enjoyed this book.
