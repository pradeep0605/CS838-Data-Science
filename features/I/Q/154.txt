I love Harry Potter and I confess to only adding this book after I found out she was the author. 2) I did not go into this with the intention to compare it to Harry Potter. I did not expect magic or wizards and I fully anticipated this being very different to the HP books. 3) I have read and enjoyed many mystery/crime novels in the past. My favourites being by Tana French and Gillian Flynn . So, there was no reason why I couldn't have enjoyed this book simply because it wasn't magical Potterland. But I didn't and, after putting a lot of thought into this, I think I finally understand why. Here's the sad truth: I can't stand Rowling's writing when she writes for adults. I actually find it painful to read. Let's be clear from the beginning, I started and never finished The Casual Vacancy because the opening didn't grab me and there was something about it - something which I couldn't put my finger on - that made it an effort to get through. A certain style to the writing which didn't agree with me. I thought perhaps it was a one-off because I'd read all her other works and never had a problem with her writing style. That's why I jumped at the chance to try another adult book by Rowling and sort out what was evidently a bout of silliness on my part. What this book did give me was an answer to why neither of Rowling's adult books worked for me. Rowling writes in an unusual manner. It's not unique to her work for adults,<---M> Harry Potter has it too</---M>, but the effect had on both is very different. Rowling's style of writing, including the dialogue between characters, is formal to the point of being old-fashioned. Part of me wants to compare it to Austen but I'm cautious of doing so because of the amount of people (usually including myself) who might read that as a compliment. Rowling's formal style doesn't work, for me, when using it in an adult mystery and pairing it with profanity and grisly murders. It feels out of place and weighs down each page with tedious descriptions that use too many awkward similes, metaphors and adjectives. \"...face the colour of corned beef...\" \"...the snow fell with soft fingertip plunks...\" \"...long-snouted cameras...\" Her descriptions all felt a bit off to me. And I particularly didn't like the unsophisticated use of big words. It's like when inexperienced indie authors go crazy with thesaurus.com, using clunky words like \"exacerbated\" and \"exorbitant\" in casual sentences that don't benefit from it. The characters in this book never check the time or look at their watches, they \"consult\" their watches. Think I'm being picky? Try reading whole pages where every sentence replaces the obvious words with complex ones and see how far you get without your brain starting to scream. And it felt like every single noun had at least one adjective before it. Not only that, but Rowling repeats similar adjectives when referring to the objects again. In one sentence, we are told she climbed the \"steel stairs\" and in the next she's continuing up the \"metal stairs\". WHY???? And also WHYYYYYY??? Another example of Rowling's old-fashioned style is her frequent use of expressions like \"oh my!\" and \"goodness!\", expressions I'm sure some of you will recognise from Harry Potter characters. What is this? It's like Mary Poppins or Little Women or, I don't know, Little House on the Prairie. And maybe it works fine in all of those, same as it works fine in Harry Potter, but none of those also had a side-helping of profanity and very adult themes. They do all, however, share the formal language style. And while I think people were silly to say things about The Casual Vacancy like \"ohmigod this had, like, noooooo magic and even fewer dark lords\" when Rowling clearly said it was an adult mystery book and I wanted to say to those silly people: I still think it's entirely relevant to compare the two when looking at Rowling's writing style and the reason why sometimes it works and sometimes it really doesn't. The formal tone with simplistic language - like in Harry Potter - is okay, but dense descriptions and over-complicated sentences made it hard work and tedious in this book. It's like a very formal letter with the occasional random swear word thrown in. And it doesn't work. Not for me, anyway. The style simply doesn't fit the content; there's swearing and murders and people rescuing others by grabbing their breasts... I'm not even going to talk about the story beyond saying I found it a standard mystery that could have been good if I'd not had these other reasons for not liking it. The killer is not hard to guess for anyone familiar with crime mysteries but that isn't usually what I care about most in crime mysteries anyway. Plus, in this case, I'm just too blinded by my dislike for the writing. *sigh* I think it's fair to say that I'm finally done trying to enjoy Rowling's adult books. P.S. Yes, I did get a little overexcited when I googled Mary Poppins gifs. Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr ...more Dull & tedious. I was frustrated with the style of writing.

Throughout the book Strike has long conversations with many different characters. It felt like a courtroom, asking witnesses 30 or more questions one right after the other. Many of these were discussions about what \u201cmight have happened. For example \u201cI don\u2019t think he would have done it because he was...\u201d \u201cIt could have been this. But assume it\u2019s not, then what about that?\u201d \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t it have been a letter to...\u201d All these conversations are people \u201ctelling\u201d about the past with their own subjective assumptions, conclusions, and some lies. I\u2019d prefer Strike actively doing things to discover clues and some interesting, unexpected, or scary action. Even Robin, my favorite character, she went to Oxford to investigate something. We should have watched her and seen her interacting with people. Instead Robin \u201ctells\u201d what she learned to Strike afterwards. Like in the first paragraph, she is answering a bunch of questions about her past activity. The author used the word \u201chad\u201d a lot - more \u201ctelling\u201d not showing. NO CLUES TO THE READER UNTIL THE TELL-ALL AT THE END: There are no clues until the last fourth of the book. Then there are a few clues but they don\u2019t mean anything to the reader. For example one character said he noticed drops of water on the floor. I had no idea what that meant until Strike does his \u201ctell all\u201d at the end where he explains the long complicated story of what happened, who lied and why, what caused the water drops, etc. I prefer mysteries where the reader learns some clues along the way that mean something. ROBIN IS THE BEST PART: The best part was the beginning. I really enjoyed the character Robin, Strike\u2019s temporary assistant. She shows up on her first day just before a new client arrives. She asks Strike if he and the client would like coffee or tea. Strike says yes without thinking. There is no coffee or tea, but she brings it, and Strike has no idea where she got it. A few times he calls her Sandra without thinking. That relationship was fun. Robin has great initiative and ideas. And she does some neat things. But she is only a small part of the story. ENDING NOT CLEAR TO ME: I didn\u2019t understand \u201cwhy\u201d John hired Strike. This was answered, but the answer didn\u2019t feel right. SWEARING LANGUAGE: Strike has a long conversation with Evan who used the f-word every other sentence. I was tired of hearing it. It was a long conversation. Other characters used the f-word less frequently which didn\u2019t bother me as much. NARRATOR: The narrator Robert Glenister was good. But I grew tired of the British accent he used for many characters. \u201cLook what I got\u201d sounds like \u201cLoo wha I goh.\u201d He was probably being accurate, but it was not easy listening for long periods of time.

Firstly, there is the main character, Cormoran Strike - a wounded war veteran, with a troubled past, damaged love life and financial woes, which see him sleeping in his office when we first meet him. Strike has left the army, which provided him with the structure and home life his mother never could, and set up as a Private Detective. The only problem is, a lack of paying clients. He then receives a new temporary secretary, Robin Ellacott, with her slightly stuffy fiance and her secret desire to be a detective. Both Strike and Robin, are fully fleshed out characters that we care about deeply by the end of the book. The crime Strike is asked to investigate involves a famous supermodel, who falls (or is pushed) from her balcony on a snowy, London night. Lula Landry is the adopted daughter of a wealthy family and her adopted brother is insistent that she had no suicidal feelings when he met up with her that day. As Strike sets out to investigate, we are introduced to a cast of identifiable characters - the effeminate dress designer, drug taking Paparazzi avoiding boyfriend, disgrunted 'wannabee' film star chauffeur, elderly, dying mother, disapproving family members, etc. Although the plot is really quite a simple one, it works very well. The author has created a totally realistic scenario, with London almost becoming an extra character as Strike walks the streets and a satisfactory plot with a good cast of suspects. I would say that Cormoran Strike is the best new addition to the P I genre that I have read for a long time. He certainly deserves a series and I hope to see him appear in many more books. There were tantalising glimpses of his past which need much further exploration and perhaps the author can be kinder to him in the next book and, at least, get him a proper place to sleep. I feel he will serve the author well and deserves a little looking after! If you enjoy really intelligent, well written crime novels (P D James, etc) then this will be a book you will love. Great start to what will, hopefully, become a long running series. * Have just found out this was written by J K Rowling. I am glad I didn't know that when I read it and I hope it doesn't put her off continuing the series, now she has been 'outed' as the author. It is a good read on its own merits. ...more \u201cHe had never been able to understand the assumption of intimacy fans felt with those they had never met.\u201d I'll venture a guess that J.K.Rowling is not a stranger to this feeling.

And yet yours truly is selfishly celebrating the infamous leak of the unknown mystery writer's true identity since otherwise I would have been quite unlikely to pick up this tome given the ever-growing size of my precariously balanced to-read pile that is beginning to dangerously resemble the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Lula Landry, a supermodel, falls to her death from her balcony; the police called it a suicide, her brother feels it was foul play and hires Cormoran Strike, a bear-like ex-soldier, to investigate. Propelled by his desperate need for money and aided by his lovely idealistic temporary secretary Robin Ellacott, Strike plunges into the shallow world of celebrity culture and London's rich and wannabe-rich, slowly unraveling the threads of the mystery of Landry's fall. <+++>The Cuckoo's Calling</+++> is an unusual mystery novel by today's industry standards. It's lacking high stakes or important villains or breakneck-fast pace or shocking twists that seem to have become almost a requirement of the genre. Its language is slow, a bit formal and occasionally reminding me of the early years of the past century rather than modern times. It's a slowly developing story, quiet and observant, focused not on the plot but on the wide tapestry of characters, spending time with them through conversations and somewhat old-fashioned 'detecting' in a way that to a certain point reminded me of the works of the Queen of the genre, Miss Agatha Christie. But only to a point, as it's missing the annoying know-it-all smug detective and instead has a gruff but very human quite flawed war veteran tuned PI Cormoran Strike: \u201cOther people his age had houses and washing machines, cars and television sets, furniture and gardens and mountain bikes and lawnmowers: he had four boxes of crap, and a set of matchless memories.\u201d I can barely express the enjoyment I experienced from the interactions of Strike with the wide cast of potential suspects and witnesses, most of them belonging to the world of British rich and famous; his ability to zero in on different aspects of their personalities, to study their very essence, to get them to slowly reveal their real frequently shallowly unattractive selves - so often ugly and petty - that satisfyingly replace any number of car chases or gunfights or mad dizzying dashes from place to place to place that I came to expect from the genre. \u201cHow could the death of someone you had never met affect you so?\u201d But what I really appreciated in this slowly developing character-centered even-keeled narrative was the ever-increasing spotlight on Lula Landry - a young woman whose death started it all, who ends up being more than just a springboard for the story but its heart, its centerpiece as we get to glimpse more of her through Strike's eyes, as we see her morph from just a pretty face into a full fleshed presence behind the story. \u201cHe had hoped to spot the flickering shadow of a murderer as he turned the file's pages, but instead it was the ghost of Lula herself who emerged, gazing up at him, as victims of violent crimes sometimes did, through the detritus of their interrupted lives.\u201d Lula may initially appear to have little substance to her, to be little but a blank slate on which gossip-hungry public is eager to project their desires and hopes and even spite. But as the novel progresses, we see the glimpses of her personality and the uglier sides of the world of fame she inhabits - the world of flashing camera lights blinding your each step and every word you say having potential to end up in a yellow press column. Rowling's disdain of such flipside of fame is palpable indeed. \u201cHow easy it was to capitalize on a person\u2019s own bent for self-destruction; how simple to nudge them into non-being, then to stand back and shrug and agree that it had been the inevitable result of a chaotic, catastrophic life.\u201d I quite enjoyed this book. I liked the smart mystery, the unexpected light humor, the apt descriptions (even if at times they would get a tad too wordy), the stinging satire, and, of course, the frequent grave seriousness when Rowling turns her eye to the 'real world' problems. \u201cThe country was lumbering towards election day. Strike turned in early on Sunday and watched the day's gaffes, counterclaims and promises being tabulated on his portable TV. There was an air of joylessness in every news report he watched. The national debt was so huge that it was diffcult to comprehend. Cuts were coming, whoever won; deep, painful cuts; and sometimes, with their weasel words, the party leaders reminded Strike of the surgeons who had told him cautiously that he might experience a degree of discomfort; they who would never personally feel the pain that was about to be inflicted.\u201d I'll easily recommend this book for anyone who'd like a few enjoyable afternoons with a brainy delicious story. 4 stars and an excited anticipation for more offerings from Rowling, Galbraith or whatever name she chooses to use for her future writing endeavours. ---------------------------- My old pre-review (the one responsible for the discussion in the comments) is below in a spoiler tag: (view spoiler) [Here's what's puzzling me: If you are Joanne Rowling and have traveled the path from rags to riches, and have created such a strong brand name at this point thanks to your amazing imagination, why in the world would you want to hide behind a pseudonym? You have earned the recognition your name brings! I wonder if that's the result of a backlash The Casual Vacancy received from Harry Potter fans for not being, well, like 'Harry Potter'? But in this case, wouldn't writing *more* books unlike Potter under your own name eventually lead to people associating you with literature that is not about young wizards?

So, af A first-time author who goes by the unassuming name of Robert Galbraith comes out with a mystery novel called The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling . The book receives favourable reviews and is wholeheartedly accepted by the fraction of the populace that reads it. And then ( and this I borrow from reliable old Wikipedia ), the Sunday Times scratches it\u2019s stubbly chin and wonders how a first-time author with a background in the army and the civilian security industry, could write such an assured debut novel. So, after much sleuthing and an inquisitive: followed by a generous bit of loose lips launching the Queen Ship, it was revealed that Robert Galbraith was in fact J.K.Rowling . I could almost imagine Tom Riddle\u2019s wand swishing blood-red, curlicue letters in the air: * Robert Galbraith is J.K.Rowling * * J.K.Rowling is Robert Galbraith * Ofcourse, all hell promptly broke loose after that. (I am also pretty sure that Madame Rowling went Loki-at- Comic-Con in the privacy of her tastefully done up living room) For me, laying my hands on the book ( courtesy, the best Hufflepuff in the magical and muggle world, Mith ) was nothing short of the Almighty smiling benevolently down at me with a new commandment : Thou shalt read the new Rowling tablet. Forsaking all others, thou shalt not stir till thou has reached ye last page. Thou shalt be rewarded for thy loyalty And believe me, it was a wholly rewarding experience. ---------------------------- SYNOPSIS : Super-Model Lula Landry has plunged to her death from her posh Mayfair balcony. While the media has pegged it down as a suicide by a troubled star, her half-brother is convinced that she has been killed. And so, he hires Cormoran Strike , a down-on-his-luck detective to investigate the case. As Strike, aided by his new (albeit temporary) secretary, Robin ; gathers clues, gets sidetracked and traverses the length and breadth of London to unravel the truth\u2026he faces his own demons and realizes that things can get really ugly, really fast. ---------------------------- REVIEW : The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling is a delightfully straightforward murder mystery. And at it\u2019s helm is the equally delightful Cormoran Strike . Cormoran is not your conventionally good-looking, lit-cheroot-hanging-seductively-from-his-lower lip, lady-slaying Private Eye. He is a massive, rugby-player sized man, not-so-easy-on-the-eye and burdened with a prosthetic leg ( Mad-Eye Moody lives? ), a vindictive ex, a grimy family background and dire finances. But, hell\u2019s bells, he is plain out adorable. His innate decency, his blustering efforts to not sully the sexual waters with his attractive new secretary, his attention to detail and his flashes of vulnerability make him a well-rounded main lead. He is not a fabulously perfect hero and so I have the biggest crush on him. And therefore, if the book translates into a movie ( please, please, please ), I would fervently hope that Nathan Fillion would fill Cormoron\u2019s shoes. I mean yes, Fillion is a dreamboat, but he has the whole clumsy-yet-suave air down to a tee and we have already seen how perfectly adequate he looks, cast as a film noir detective in CASTLE\u2019s The Blue Butterfly. I mean, look at him: Coming to Cormoran\u2019s new secretary, Robin \u2026she is an absolute star. Robin is freshly engaged to a very proper young man and is gooey-eyed enough to settle for a two point five existence. But she craves excitement. Not the sordid excitement of a secret fling but the childish glee of solving a mysterious mystery. And she\u2019s the perfect foil to Cormoron\u2019s elegant hippo act. Infact, with her strawberry blonde hair and her transparent need to \"Run with the Doctor Detective\", she reminded me of Amy Pond: Will love transpire between Robin and Cormoran? If it does, I, for one, will be knitting booties for their bonnie babies. The Supporting cast of characters is rich and varied. I loved each one of them. From the coke-snorting Tansy to the meticulous security man to the slightly unhinged half-brother to the wolf-masking wearing boyfriend (and prime suspect) to the ego-boosting Ciara Porter to the larger than life rapper to the maliciously camp designer; I loved all their character profiles. Everyone had a solid role to play and everyone was infinitely readable. Minion kisses for all: For all the Britophiles out there, this is a treat. Modern day London effectively wears the garb of a smoky 1940s lamplit whodunnit. You are utterly charmed and steadily soak in the atmosphere like a comforting soak in a hot tub. As for the pace of the plot, it is slow and steady. There are no cliff hangers ( the staple of mystery novels ) at the end of each chapter. There are no high-octane moments. There are no unexpected plot twists. And yet, you carry on. Your interest never wanes. The story builds up steadily, from a strong skeleton to a steady fleshing out of detail coupled with a handful of sinews worked in with precision and finally, the end result is a fully functioning thriller. The story is no great shakes. If you have been a mystery enthusiast, you will figure out the baddie pretty soon. But the joy of reading a good crime novel is to rub your hands in glee as you poke your head over the long-suffering detective\u2019s shoulder and go, in your head, \u201cOoh, ohh\u2026I KNEW IT!\u201d Rowling\u2019s writing is flawless, witty and generously peppered with some choice abuses. Ron Weasley would approve. Her skill is strong as ever and shorn of any pretensions. Her observations on human fallacies are uncomfortably accurate. She holds, what could be a rambling storyline together, purely on the strength of her intuitive grasp on her characters' emotions. At the end of the day, she justifies her right to the Writing Throne. I come away, utterly and completely enchanted. ---------------------------- ...more Meet Cormoran Strike..on BBC Tom Burke, he's hot but I'll miss picturing him as Huge Jackman :) His first 'Mystery' which haunt me from the early beginning, even the epigraph.

Why were you born when the snow was falling? You should have come to the cuckoo\u2019s calling, It starts When snow was falling..and a 'Cuckoo' fell... A famous model star fall off the balcony to her tragic death..the paparazzi gather around her body just as they did when she was alive.. Her neighbor assert that she heard her arguing and shouting with a man \"The Killer\" right before seeing her fall. The police declare that's a lie, the DNA proves there was no stranger there..All the evidences and investigation declare she was alone. The result is what the police saw was clear from the beginning..Suicide. 'Celebrities always go cuckoo..depression would drive them for that' Some say. 'She was exciting about her new big contract and upcoming trip..she was far from suicide act' Others say. You'll find thorough the investigations and evidences that no trace of a killer in the scene.. so ... it's Suicide Case Closed. And then our Story begins 3 Months later Robin ,A beautiful blonde young lady living her Best Romantic days after getting engaged to her boyfriend ,Went to work as a Temp secretary for some office, she \"surprised\" to find out the business of the office is her long lost childish ambition of work.. It was an office of A.. Private Detective.. Cormoran Strike ,An ex-Military, Private detective Living his Worst days of his life, just separated from his fiance, His office just got one client..with all his debts; He just stuck with a new temp secretary he can't even afford paying her for her only week...unless he saved by a wealthy client.. John Bristow ,An unexpected new \"wealthy\" client to Strike's office, as a favor for old friendship between Strike and the latter's brother .. He came for the detective to dig up a very famous case that he didn't agree with its results...A case of his dead -adopted- sister...A Famous Model... Lula Landry Yes.. Lula Landry \"Cuckoo\" is the famous Model we've witnessed her tragic death at the first scene... Why were you born when the snow was falling? You should have come to the cuckoo\u2019s calling, Or when grapes are green in the cluster, Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster For their far off flying From summer dying. Why did you die when the lambs were cropping? You should have died at the apples\u2019 dropping, When the grasshopper comes to trouble, And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble, And all winds go sighing For sweet things dying. As I've said, the story will haunt you from the very early beginning, its first scene..even from this 19th Century Poem. Although I've never been into poems & poetry, But this haunting one -may be cause I've heard it also on youtube- makes me really into the mode of \"<+++>The Cuckoo's Calling</+++>\". Also I have to say that Rowling has a great epigraphs choices, like in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" with 2 epigraphs that fit with the final story of Harry\" Also It haunt me for a 'D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu' for an accident that happened 12 years ago almost like the beginning of this novel,also in London.. A death of A Sweetheart,A Cinderella of Egyptian Cinema...that her case's investigations was almost identical to the case of Cuckoo..from the first scene.. I love also the glimpse for famous tragic death of celebrity which \"pushed\" by paparazzi or even cases closed \"wrongly\" as suicide. There's also that great tribute for the soldiers who are trying to readjust with civilian life after leaving the military one for a reason or another. Some may say it's a bit slow in the first half, but I really respect, even adore that detailed characters and events..it makes me get to know more about Strike and the lovely Robin as I'm with them in the Private Detective office.. and their cool 'professional' relation. I've actually got into the case of Lula, investigated with Strike the evidences and tried to interview everyone who was near from Lula the day of her death..And I've even got a GREAT experience decipher the \"Body Language\" while investigating some characters. And by the half of the novel -As I've written most of this review, right now- I've really wondered ; Is it really a suicide..or a Murder? ************************ The Setting ; London ***************** I used to say in Dan Brown's Novels reviews That it's better to use Illustrated edition or keep searching in Google Image search for the places he describe brilliantly in his novels. The same is here.. J.K. Rowling talent in creating a beautifully Magical world in Harry Potter, or realistic fictional Pagford in The Casual Vacancy proved to be still great in describing the magic of real places as London. You'll really love to see the statue of Eros; Piccadilly Circus while Robin starts a new step in her romantic life.. You'll walk up and down Denmark Street and 12 Bar Caf\u00e9 with its Music Instruments and where The Detective office Locates. You'll be in real famous Pubs and Bars in London with its Victorian faces. And these pubs' windows view of the 1920s building decorated with statues by Jacob Epstein And on the top of all , The elegant Victorian houses at the most wealthy neighborhood and streets like Bellamy Road and Mayfair. The bottom line is ,you're invited to a lovely journey into the heart of London at the moment you start the novel. ************************ The Characters ************ One more time, like all her work, The author writes the characters -even the secondary ones- in very detailed way, you discover more about them and their past by each new chapter, which really makes you as if you actually Living with them..and in this case,you're trying to solve a hidden mystery in a case with the Detective... **** Cormoran Strike **** Make a lot of thinking who would play him, -specially it wasn't clear his age at till book two- Alan Rickman is too old, may be Robert Downey Jr. but he's not English -although it didn't stop him being Holmes - and finally Hugh Jackman :)who I stuck with, some suggested Hagrid \"without the costumes of course\" Ex-Military still love discipline of the military life; Can't live with it anymore though ..and not because of his injury. Private Detective with big debts...just a client or two in the best days..and not even investigate the crazy death threatens he got regularly. Adore his ex-fiancee Charlotte..but can't live with her lies.. Illegitimate son for a famous star..Hates it'd be his \"fame\". A very complicated character that you'll love to know him better page after page.. Wanting to know more about him and may you'd end up like me ..Waiting more books for him. **** Robin Ellacott **** A New Hermione-type. Super smart,clever, got the spirit of initiative. And this time,Super beautiful. As if Jo this time assert that women are smart even those super pretty ones. I love how she got a childish dream of her being a Detective herself. and I got so attached with her complicated \"romance and nonsense free\" relation with Strike and I was praying she'd stay till the end and to see her again in the next books of the series. **** Lula Landry \"Cuckoo\" **** Emma Stone was the first face come in mind when I saw the US edition's cover,I know that at the novel she doesn't look like her at all \u201cWith all the gallons of newsprint and hours of televised talk that have been poured forth on the subject of Lula Landry\u2019s death, rarely has the question been asked: why do we care? Why Do We Care? Well, you'll know page by page. You'll get into the real Lula or \"Cuckoo\" as she and her best pals calls her, by the testimony of her brother,the news and articles written about her that you know from Robin's internet search ,and the tales and testimonies of those who were near her, one by one by how close to her they were as the story goes. But you'll get better look into her by reading with Strike her personal emails ,clear look as if you looking into her soul,or ghost. I promise that,before the half of the novel as in my case, you'll really love to know more about that lovely ,complicated character of Lula...And you'll really Care..and wonder. How Did Lula Landry really Die? *********************** The Propaganda ************* Fame sometimes is a double-edged sword.. The Casual Vacancy 's 500+ was rated 'one star' in few hours after its release JUST because it's not Harry-ish ; or some didn't like Harry Potter or Rowling herself. I guess that's why the decision of publishing under Pseudonym..And honestly,as the writer, I wished it'd last longer \"Even I may never hear about it unless it get good publicity or hit the news of up-coming movie based on it, And I'm sure I'll still LOVE it even if I didn't know it's Rowling's. And if you saw the Goodreads main page of the book at 14th.July 2013 you'll find all of the reviews very positive and even 4.1+ rating and it didn't start getting a '1 Star' but after the announcement of the real author. Anyway I'm sure Rowling get GREAT researching Robert-Galbraith bio. as seen on \"About the Author\" in the 1st Printing of the book -which get sold out after few minutes of the announcement and auctioned with hundredth of dollars and I was lucky to get one of these 1st prints for this small captions about the author that wasn't at any other later printings. ROBERT GALBRAITH spent several years with the Royal Military Police before being attached to the SIB (Special Investigative Branch), the plainclothes branch of the RMP. He left the military in 2003 and has been working since then in the civilian security industry. The idea for Cormoran Strike grew directly out of his own experiences and those of his military friends who returned to the civilian world. \u201cRobert Galbraith\u201d is a pseudonym. You'd feel Robert's really like Strike himself.. It's clearly that J.K. Rowling did a lot of research about the Ex-Militarily officers and their lives. You'll touch that at many points in the novel. *********************** Finally ******* Haunting Case..Check Catching introduction for the main characters .. Check Smart Investigations .. Check Real Exercise on reading the Body Language .. Check Marvelous setting ,very realistic; still magical.. Check I fall in love with the mystery of this novel, the characters and every thing , I've read it slowly to keep it in my hand for as long as I can. \"took me 4 weeks reading almost as the same duration of the plot\" And I'd really recommend it strongly to any crime thriller readers.. I love this praise The Cuckoo's Calling reminds me why I fell in love with crime fiction in the first place (Val McDermid) But in my case ..The Cuckoo's Calling is why I \"newly\" fell in love with crime fiction. I loved investigatings and the detective work,with all the observation and reading the body language. I loved the characters ,Robin is wonderful ,Lula even we don't have any \"live\" scene for her even no flashbacks but I truly attached to her case ,Liked her so much,she became a name for me and also.. Cormoran Strike Became a Name.

No more wait day after day for the plot of her new book, the cover, release dates etc.. No more \"negative\" reviews just for her name only after just hours of the release of the books As what happened with The Casual Vacancy That was what made me really Super HAPPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY \"And of course you know how anyone would react when He's 30 I've Ordered it at the same day from Amazon And Truly can't wait THANK YOU Queen Jo.,Queen of wizard and witches, Queen of Magic Mohammed Arabey 14th July 2013 ...more SOLID. It was a bit too long for my taste (I feel like it could have had a little less dialogue and such), but I really liked the characters! Strike and Robin all day. I like detective novels and I am a fan of J.K. Rowling, so when I found out that this \"Robert Galbraith\" was a pseudonym of Rowling, I thought that it was the perfect combination of elements that I have to read the book as soon as possible. I have to admit that in good amount of the book I wasn't enjoying it so much. I was feeling it too slow, and nothing exciting was happening, since Cormoran Strike, the detective, wasn't doing much just asking questions to each witness and the events was gettin I like detective novels and I am a fan of J.K. Rowling, so when I found out that this \"Robert Galbraith\" was a pseudonym of Rowling, I thought that it was the perfect combination of elements that I have to read the book as soon as possible. I have to admit that in good amount of the book I wasn't enjoying it so much. I was feeling it too slow, and nothing exciting was happening, since Cormoran Strike, the detective, wasn't doing much just asking questions to each witness and the events was getting over and over, it was tedious. My anchor to keep reading it was Robin, the secretary of Strike, since she is a wonderful character that gives a way positive and radiant atmosphere to the book when she is in the scene. I think that besides that she is smart, proactive and good hearted, also she gets excited about being in the world of private detectives and that exciment was contagious with me. There are some detective teams that the lead character is so great that sometimes the \"sidekick\" doesn't get the proper credit, but here I have to tell you that Robin is as important to the effectiveness of the novel as Cormoran, the lead character. If you took her out of the formula, the magic (pun intended) would dissapear. Okay, as I was saying, the book was slow and there were too much details about the private life of Cormoran (I mean, why do I want to read about his nephew's birthday party or all the times that he goes to get a shower in the university campus?! Geez!) I want to read about the case and I really think that the book could have less length but I guess that when it's an author with the reputation of Rowling, they can't let to print a good book with a 300+ pages, no, it has to be 400+ or nothing. I wouldn't be surprised if the second book will get 500+ pages. But I really do hope that it would be with less pages. So, the book was slow, real slow, tedious interviews, but right when I was like 20% of finishing the book, bam! the tempo changed and all the pieces of the puzzle were starting to get into place, you get a good speed of narrative and then you see Cormoran Strike as an awesome detective worthy to be side-by-side with Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade. Also, I like that the character is smoking cigarrettes. I am not pro or against smoking, I just think that it's silly that nowadays almost all authors are like too much afraid of using characters with the habit of smoke like if that would alienate the readers. I am not here to discuss about medicine and health, I just say that a private detective looks cool smoking. So, if you decide to read this book, please finish it , don't leave it in the middle of the reading because you're getting bored, I can guarantee you that the smashing ending with be worthy of keeping with the book until the great end. Bravo Rowling, you did it again! ;) If there is a second book in this series, I'll be there to read it too. Update: (June-24-2014) Indeed there are now a second novel and I am man of my word ;) I am reading the second book now! ...more Did J.K Rowling out herself that she was the author of this book using a pen name or did someone else do it? I'm pretty sure she would have told the world if she WANTED people to know she wrote this, obviously she wanted the old feeling of people not knowing who the author is and now I feel bad for her. I'll read this eventually but I'm not shitting my undies looking for a copy. UPDATE: yup, she didn't want her secret out yet: \"I had hoped to keep this secret a little longer,\" JKR said, \"because be Did J.K Rowling out herself that she was the author of this book using a pen name or did someone else do it?

It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name.\" ANOTHER UPDATE: Goodreads you should have left J.K. Rowling's pen name author page alone, it's not that damn necessary to make sure everyone knows she wrote this. Everyone will find out eventually. Now you've added her name as a co-author to the book as well. I don't think it's right to have the real author's name on a pen name book page, they even did it with Stephen King's pen name page as well. ...more I'm a bit puzzled by the rave reviews. It's okay, but a fairly run-of-the-mill detective story. A private eye with a silly name solves a murder mystery, and there is a long exposition at the end of the how and why. The characters are quite well drawn, and the writing is competent, but I wouldn't seek out any further books with the same star. I didn't know, when I reviewed this, that it was written by J K Rowling! But it doesn't change my view. Check out Scott Reads It! for reviews, giveaways, & more! When it was revealed that J.K.

Rowling had written a novel under the pseudonym, Robert Galbraith; I knew I had to read it. Rowling filled my childhood with magic, intrigue, and beauty with her Harry Potter series so I was eager to read her sophomore adult novel. It angers me how Rowling was betrayed by a friend who had revealed that she was the genius behind The Cuckoo's Calling. Every cloud does have it's silver lining and now, millions of people will be introduced to a clever mystery noir. Another silver lining is that Rowling will be donating her royalties from The Cuckoo's Calling to charity for the next 3 years. I'm still angered how someone could have betrayed Rowling in such a cruel manner. The Cuckoo's Calling is a much stronger novel than The Casual Vacancy and will definitely appeal to a wider audience than her adult debut. The Cuckoo's Calling is filled with all of Rowling's signature wit and charm that readers love. It's extremely evident from the writing style that Rowling still has the ability to create a tour de force, a novel that will definitely be looked on fondly 50 years in the future. This novel is a triumphant return for the Queen of Literature and it proves that J.K's domain and prowess doesn't just extend to children's literature. This is an impressive piece of literature that is filled with immense intrigue and mystery. Albeit the beginning does have it's faults and is a tad slow-paced, this novel was extremely riveting. From start to finish, The Cuckoo's Calling does have it's share of dull moments, but they are overshadowed by the brilliance of Cormoran Strike. This is the mystery novel that I've been waiting for! This novel has all of the star qualities of Stieg Larsson's novel and BBC's Sherlock. Cormoran actually really reminded me of Dr. Watson from BBC's Sherlock (Martin Freeman). Maybe it's because of their military past or that they both are a bit troubled? I really liked Cormoran, but I thought that he should confront his girlfriend and move on. I wasn't a huge fan of Robin, Cormoran's secretary because I never learned too much about her. I really didn't like how Robin put up with her boyfriend, Matthew (I think) who kept on bossing her around and Robin didn't really act like anything was wrong with that. The whole plotline with Robin was extremely predictable right from when she was interested and was too simplistic. The mystery in The Cuckoo's Calling is well-throughout with just enough intrigue to keep me peeled to the page. I actually had no idea who the killer was throughout the novel; I had my incorrect suspicions though. I really liked how Rowling explored the world of the media and celebrities in such an unique and unusual way. You never really see celebrities as actual people in novels, they are usually portrayed as these untouchable gods that ordinary people have to gloat over. The fact that Rowling to decide to add a layer of vulnerability to Landry, added an interesting touch to this book. The Cuckoo's Calling is a novel worthy of immense praise. I'll admit that the only reason I read this book was because it was written by Rowling. I'm definitely eagerly awaiting the next installment in the Comoran Strike series and I can't wait to see what antics Strike and Robin get into next. Color me surprised, but I really enjoyed The Cuckoo's Calling! ...more 16 Jul' 2013 Full confession: Pfft yeah, I totally did grab this after I heard it was written by JK Rowling ?

So, prigs to the left, please. *** Why did you die when the lambs were cropping? You should have died at the apple's dropping, when the grasshopper comes to trouble, and the wheat-fields are sodden stubble, And all the winds go sighing, for sweet things dying. -Christina G. Rossetti, \"A Dirge\" I knew Rowling was writing a crime novel for adults, which is why I was a little more than baffled when I picked up The Casual Vacancy and found it far from the murder-mystery I had been anticipating. This -- The Cuckoo's Calling -- is that murder-mystery I have long been salivating over. And the long wait definitely paid off; I was not disappointed. It starts on a grim, curious note. A young celebrity has died, plummeting to her untimely doom. And as Rowling does best, a note of glorified tension permeated this opening, drawing us from the very first turn of the page, into Lula Landry's tragic fate. What follows is the investigation into her death, formally written off as mental-health-induced suicide, by the most unlikely of all heroes: Cormoran Strike and his assistant, Robin. If you imagine a dashing, more contemporary version of Sherlock Holmes -- perhaps one Benedict Cumberbatch in all his dreamy-eyed glory -- you better put your panties back on because Strike is no poster-boy: Her accidental assailant was massive; his height, his general hairiness, coupled with a gently expanding belly, suggested a grizzly bear. But no less do we come to admire this former military man. He is quick, he is astute, and he is very much human. Like always, the best part of Rowling 's work is her ability to craft such life-like characters , whose problems and thoughts echo only too real, that no matter how bizarre or spectacular the events, we never for a second lose our immersion in the authenticity of her world. The amount of care put into every description really does show in her prose. The small, contextual humour she manages to sneak into the narrative makes it feel as if we were sharing a secret. This novel managed to be stimulating, engaging, and touching at the same time. As leisurely as the plot unfolds, never did I lose interest in Strike's investigation. My favourite fact being that there actually was an investigation! (cue the gasps) We are taken along for the ride; no clues or tidbits are left out from us readers, bereaving us from the chance of making our own accusations. No, we are kept invested in the outcome of Strike's investigation as if we were part of it ourselves. My suspicions shifted from one character to another, never making The Cuckoo's Calling a predictable nor boring read. Strike and Robin's relationship -- initially tip-toeing on propriety -- admittedly worried me at first. This is where you know you've read one too many Young-Adult or self-proclaimed \"Adult\" novels, and actually expect Rowling to do the unforgivable and use the opportunity to build up romantic tension and, God forbid, the dreaded Love Triangle. But this is Rowling we are talking about, and she steered way clear off that iceberg. Our two protagonists' chemistry remained friendly, albeit a little professional, before turning into the warm relationship a tutor might have with his apprentice. Of course if future books take this into another direction, we will see how I take it. In the meantime, I am keeping my fingers crossed. It is dynamics such as these -- between characters, within characters -- that makes The Cuckoo's Calling such a multi-faceted and descriptive novel. We see characters through many others' eyes, and yet we are left to make our own judgements, never having our thoughts made up for us like so many writers attempt to do. The peak of the novel, although not exactly a new or never-before-seen turn of events, still came out as a surprise for me. The small details collided into a seamless blanket that covered everything nice and smoothly. I was very satisfied with the ending; no questions left unanswered, no forced bit of cliffhanger to goad us into buying the next book ... So yes, I jumped on this bandwagon. And I do not regret it one bit. *** > My review of The Silkworm > My review of Career of Evil > You can also find more reviews at my blog ...more nah it was a good detective,action pact book,,,just a little slow to get going but ended good to move on to the next series ..can't wait to see what happen in book#2 For me 5 stars, I stumbled on this by accident and glad I did..

The story follows Cormoran Strike, a private investigator and ex military man who has been left with a severe injury as a reminder and has to cope mentally and physically with his injury. John Bristow approaches him with a case linked to fame and tragedy as John requires Cormoran to investigate his sister, Lula Landry's apparent suicide. The famous supermodel allegedly jumped off her balcony but John believes it was murder. The opening had me immediately hooked but this went downhill quickly with lack of action and tension. About a hundred pages could have been cut from this book as nothing of real significance happened and the story was long winded at times. The actual case wasn't very intriguing and I never felt a threat of danger or tension. At times, I found myself immensely bored and I just wanted to put down the novel. However, I definitely did enjoy the characters specifically Cormoran, Robin and Guy Som\u00e9's small appearance. Cormoran is a complex, engrossing character who made a great protagonist and Robin, his temporary secretary was a fantastic addition as she is wonderfully curious, assertive and clever. Guy Som\u00e9 is full of hilarious lines and his scene is without a doubt one of the best bits in the book and the funniest. Towards the end, the novel became exciting and thrilling as the story finally began to unfold and things began to link together. The ending is nicely done with a slightly shocking twist but the way the clues weave in together with the solved mystery is brilliantly done. J.K Rowling displayed versatility in writing different genres but to be honest, I think this book was mediocre and I'm not bothered about reading the next book unless I can find it cheap. ...more Two words for this: simply stunning.

The writing is delicious and extremely descriptive and I literally couldn't put the book down until I had finished it, it was only my sleep deprived eyes that made me put it down each night! I think we have a new PI on the block now, so everyone had better watch out as he is good, very very good. Robin is his very very likeable and extremely efficient secretary and I love her commitment to Cormoran and his failing investigative business. I do have one complaint about this book and that is that it had to end.

Think Rockford Files, Simon and Simon, Nancy Drew, Angel (without the vampires). I\u2019ve read where some people figured it out and knew who the killer was and to them I say BRAVO\u2026cuz I failed completely. Yes, all the clues were there and I should have been able to put it all together but I looked left when I totally should have looked right and so I was surprised. But I totally like it when I\u2019m fooled. Strike is a likeable enough fellow. He is a bit down on his luck both professionally and personally but that is not going to stop him from trying to get something done. I was rooting for Strike he is pretty likable as a down-and-out-just-trying-to-pick-up-the-pieces-character. \u201cOther people his age had houses and washing machines, cars and television sets, furniture and gardens and mountain bikes and lawnmowers: he had four boxes of crap, and a set of matchless memories.\u201d He has a very easy repore with people and a way of getting them to talk, controlling the situation without seeming like he is controlling the situation and he was a bit of a romantic in some ways even if his own romance was completely in the toilet. Robin his new temporary secretary has always dreamed of a job like this, even if her new employer doesn\u2019t seem excited to have her there. But she is going to make the most of this experience while she is looking for a permanent position. This was a very good start to a working relationship and hmmm\u2026. could it go in the direction of a romantic entanglement eventually . Well Robin does have a fianc\u00e9 now but things can change. Can\u2019t they? I definitely see a budding relationship of some sort there, whether it turns into a strong friendship later or more I\u2019ll be fine either way. But I think that dress will cause some problems...tehee Overall it was a decent mystery and I enjoyed the interviews with the various characters. There is quite a bit about Strike, his past, his current stalker and I liked diving into all of that. It made him feel far more real to me. I will definitely be continuing on with this pseudonym of J.K Rowling. I\u2019m adding this just because it was my favorite conversation of the book and I do love drunken declarations.

I am eager to see this novel grow as a series and have confidence it will do so. It seems fitting that just as a favored literary mystery writer, Kate Atkinson, moves into fantasy, this favored fantasy writer makes an excursion toward literary mystery. I don\u2019t hold that much stock in the appellation of \u201cliterary\u201d, as purveyors of best-selling pot-boilers of one age can ascend toward \u201cliterature\u201d status in another (e.g. Chandler). Regardless, it is fortunate that the things that matter most to me, these authors\u2019 strengths in story-telling and character development, carry through on the transition in genre they both make. The story involves a young London private detective, Cormoran Strike, working a case of a model\u2019s death by fall from a third-story balcony. The case is brought to him by a lawyer who is this Lula\u2019s adoptive brother. The police judge the death of the celebrity a suicide due to her troubled background as a half-black child abandoned by her mother and a chaotic life with the wild crowd of the rich and famous. They discount the statement of a producer\u2019s wife on the first floor, who heard an argument with a man preceding the plunge, as the fancy residence was too solidly built for such sound to carry. With the help of his brilliant new secretary from a temp agency, Robin, Strike delves for clues in the life of Lula\u2019s wealthy adoptive family and that of her friends and lover in the fashion and entertainment world. We are treated to a tour of the club scene, the fashion business, and the movie crowd, all with journalists and paparazzi buzzing around. At the other side of things, the drug culture of her boyfriend and the homeless world of a special friend of Lula\u2019s from rehab. A bit too many threads for me to keep a hungry mind focused on the mystery, especially when the diversions and red herrings span a few hundred pages. Agatha Christie could juggle a dozen clues, threads, and characters within a couple of hundred pages. The lingering with so many slices of life here would be fine the author intends a sociological analysis of a broad scope of contemporary London culture. I ended up only feeling slightly guilty over my welcoming reaction to a second body in the story. Ultimately, a clever ending left me zinging and nicely points the way for some follow-up tales with the duo. Like Atkinson\u2019s Jackson Brodie, Galbraith\u2019s Cormoran Strike is ex-military and has somewhat the heart of a Boy Scout. Though rarely called upon for dangerous protective or defensive action, we can take a bit of comfort in knowing that capacity is there when needed (if they don't stupidly walk into a crisis without remembering their weapons). Unlike most of the bruised souls solving crimes in popular fiction, both are emotionally healthy and not too bitter over losses and bad cards dealt them in the past. They are refreshingly free of addictions or do not wallow in cynicism. Tough but tender has been done before, but I\u2019ll take it gladly for a hero. I was a bit wary at Galbraith giving Strike such a sentiment-stirring vulnerability as a prosthetic leg, the result of his tour in Afghanistan. Sort of like humbling our potential superman with Kryptonite. Maybe there is some homage here to comics. Robin is just so good-hearted. Then again, she goes well beyond Lois Lane in providing timely and effective help with his case. And there is some grit to his life, as his break-up with his girlfriend leaves him living in his office and short on the rent. The larger satisfaction for me with the book lies not with solving the case, but in the understated, underground romance between Strike and his Girl Friday. As fair warning, I was sappy enough to be bowled over by the romance in King\u2019s \u201c11/23/63.\u201d The writing is usually appropriately invisible. Sometimes it shines. Like when the Strike is reading the people he interviews for the investigation. Here his perceptions of a pair of socialite sisters are written in a way that aids the reader\u2019s visualization and convey tinges of his male working-class consciousness: They were both as pristine and polished as life-size dolls recently removed from their cellophane boxes; rich-girl thin, almost hipless in their tight jeans, with tanned faces that had a waxy sheen especially noticeable on their foreheads, their long, gleaming dark manes with center partings, spirit-level exactitude. Her eyes were fractionally too close together, and the Botox and fillers could not smooth away the petulance in her expression. But doesn\u2019t this come close to calling attention to the fine writing, disrupting your immersion in the scene? I don\u2019t think so in this case. But check out the following example of Strike\u2019s perception of a fashion designer friend of Lula\u2019s: His face contrasted strangely with his taut, lean body, for it abounded in exaggerated curves: the eyes exophthalmic so they appeared fishlike, looking out of the sides of his head. The cheeks were round, shining apples and full-lipped mouth was a wide oval; his small head was almost perfectly spherical. Some looked as though he had been carved out of soft ebony by a master hand that had grown bored with its own expertise, and started to veer towards the grotesque. To me this feels like jarring and awkward overwriting. All in all such bits didn\u2019t disrupt my pleasure much. I just leave some room for improvement in rating stars on the next one. ...more This was FANTASTICALLY well written. But I mean, no surprise there seeing as it was written by the queen.

After initial speculations of murder, the police rule the death as a suicide. But Lula\u2019s brother, John Bristow refuses to accept that his sister, despite all the reports in the media and evidence shown by the police, could commit suicide. He hires a private detective Cormoran Strike, an ex-military man, to investigate the death of his sister. Sounds nothing extraordinary, right? Yeah, but that is where the brilliance of JK Rowling comes in. She takes a story that\u2019s been told so many times and makes it enthralling. The wit and mysterious tone that was so evident in Harry Potter series is back in this book. While reading this book I was reminded of Agatha Christie mysteries. \u2018The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling\u2019 has the same tone and feel to it. Cormoran Strike, despite being burly and bear like, reminded me a lot of Hercule Poirot. Like Poirot, Strike too relies mostly on his \u2018little grey cells\u2019 and uses methodical investigative skills. Despite his appearance and background Strike oozes a certain vulnerability that I found endearing. His pairing up with Robin (yes, I was reminded of Batman and Robin too), a secretary sent to him by a temp agency, feels like a match made in heaven. Both Strike and Robin are well fleshed out characters. The novel isn\u2019t fast paced or action packed. But the mystery, Strike\u2019s adventures and JK Rowling\u2019s writing are intriguing enough to keep the reader interested. As always JK Rowling\u2019s prose is beautiful and enchanting. Take this paragraph for instance \u2013 \u201cIt was strange, but nevertheless true, that the countless photographs of her otherworldly beauty had made it harder rather than easier for Strike to believe that Landry had ever really existed . . . Now, however, out of these dry black marks on paper, out of erratically spelled messages littered with in-jokes and nicknames, the wraith of the dead girl rose before him in the dark office. Her emails gave him what the multitude of photographs had not: a realization in the gut, rather the brain, that a real, living, laughing and crying human being had been smashed to death on that snowy London street.\u201d The only quandary I have with the novel is its predictability. The ending dint quite surprise me. But all in all \u2018The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling\u2019 is a really good mystery novel and worth a read. PS- It doesn\u2019t surprise me that JK Rowling decided to write a mystery novel. Firstly I remember an interview of hers where she expressed an interest in writing a murder mystery (that is the reason why I thought \u2018The Casual Vacancy\u2019 was a mystery novel). And secondly mystery was an underlying genre in Harry Potter series. Severus Snape\u2019s story arc is one of the best mysteries I have ever read. ...more Into every crime fiction reader's life something like THE CUCKOO'S CALLING should sneak.

But you know it when it is happening. A feeling that this is exactly the sort of book that you've been looking for. It's the sort of book that makes you start to resent the need for sleep, and not regret ignored chores for one second. Part of what makes this such a fantastic book is the characters. The central private detective Cormoran Strike comes from the school of lone wolves, but very current day. He's an injured war veteran, a recently ex-fianc\u00e9, struggling businessman, living in his office after what seems like the final split from his volatile ex. His temporary help in the office, Robin, is surprisingly normal, a country girl come to the city, she's efficient, a self-starter who enjoys the difference of working for a PI. So much so, that she doesn't seem all that keen to take on a more stable, full time job even though her buttoned down boyfriend thinks she should. There's a lot more background to both of them, but it's woven into the story of an investigation triggered when a brother comes to Strike for help after the fall off a balcony of a troubled, very famous model is called a suicide. Which leads to the other part that makes THE CUCKOO'S CALLING such a fantastic book. It's a terrific plot. Twisty, unexpected, littered with possibilities and alternatives, it's such an intriguing case. There's such a contrast between the lives of the rich and famous, and those less materially fortunate who look into their lives. There's the contrast between famous for not a lot, and injured and maimed for an awful lot. There's also great humanity and touching complications in the relationship between Strike and Robin, Robin and her boyfriend, Strike and just about everybody he comes across. It's also a plot that leads to a conclusion that, I didn't see coming, but when it arrived, made complete sense. There's really only one problem with books as good as THE CUCKOO'S CALLING.

Before you continue reading, I\u2019ll point out that this is a MYSTERY. If you don\u2019t like the genre, you will probably not like it even if you are a great fan of Harry Potter. As the description points out, this is a mystery in the classic vein so there are no serial killers. Most of the book is about Strike reconstructing events, interviewing witnesses and dealing with the fallout of his failed relationship and his new life. The book is not boring by any means but it won\u2019t appeal to people who don\u2019t like the genre or are offended by cursing \u2013 this is an adult book with tons of f-bombs. The plot is intricate and very well developed but the characters are by far the stronger part of the story. I found Strike in particular very appealing, hairy belly and all. :) He\u2019s big, hairy and sort of ugly (one of his charming childhood nicknames was \u201cpube head.\u201d) However, he\u2019s extremely smart, savvy, very honest and not afraid to get rough if needed. As he starts investigating, he uncovers the life of a mixed-race, bipolar girl who found stardom and couldn\u2019t fully trust anybody. Instead of sadness, her death had a sense of inevitability as if her life couldn\u2019t have ended any other way but in tragedy. The secondary characters are as strong as Cormoran: the very efficient Robin, Lula Landry and the entourage of people who loved her but nevertheless used her for their own means. I was particularly impressed by two important characters that barely say a word in the book: Charlotte and Deeby Macc. Their presence in the book is so tangible but all we know is what other people think of them. We learn about Charlotte through Strike\u2019s dissection of their relationship and discover Deeby by the lyrics of his songs and the adoration of his fans. I was left very curious as to both characters and wanted to know whether those impressions were real. I had the pleasure to listen to the audiobook narrated by Robert Glenister. The audiobook was simply fabulous, with Mr. Glenister doing a tremendous job with all those regional British accents. Not being a native English speaker, I usually have problems with those (sometimes I have to turn on the captions when I watch Masterpiece Mystery) but I understood every word, even the slang. I was captivated by his voice and depth of feeling from the moment Mr. Glenister recites the poem at the beginning. He truly does a masterful job with the narration. Although it\u2019s not clear whether this will be a series, the end of this book felt like a beginning. The way things ended up with Robin and Charlotte seemed to say \u2018to be continued.\u2019 But mostly because of the last line of the book, a phrase from a poem that floated out of Strike\u2019s subconscious: \"I am become a name.\" Audiobook narrated by Robert Glenister.

This book was Great!!! I love all the characters and the general pace of the book. Cormoran Strike has most certainly become one of my fave Private Detective. It was really refreshing to see that his character was one that was beautifully flawed. I really get tired of writers having all there protagonist as dazzingly handsome prince charming that are misunderstood.

It had exactly every single problem I was worried it would have. Plus, in my opinion, a weak conclusion to the mystery.

Robert Galbraith certainly has chops in the mystery writing universe, even if his first effort falls a bit short. The stuttering formality turned me off from the beginning, and carried through all the way to the end, even if the stick might have been removed from the buttocks for brief periods of time, the majority of which revolved around enthusiastic sidekick Robin. Formal dialogue splattered with dashes filled the pages, and an overemphasis with the ellipsis further helped separate me from the tale, and was closely followed by characters who liked to overstate and expound upon points a little too forcefully, pounding the corpse repeatedly after the last breath had already expired from the body. Other than Robin, formal, stilted characters seemed to plaster the pages, many of whom felt dry cleaned, instead of going through the normal rinse cycle. The plot plodded along at a slow, steady pace, and proved slow to develop despite the dashing dead body early on. The ending of THE CUCKOO\u2019S CALLING would have been aided by the liberal use of the delete key, and like the rest of the tale, was a bit long on atmosphere and extraneous information. While the premise proved strong and inviting, the story didn\u2019t quite live up to its enticing origins. On a related note, it\u2019s probably good my NetGalley request wasn\u2019t approved for this novel, even though I could have blown the whistle on her pseudonym a full two months before the official slip. Mulholland Books is probably patting itself on the back, as they dodged that bullet and my less than favorable review, even if it was only a temporary respite.

I enjoyed it, but I certainly was no fangirl. This is for the best, because I am judging this book on its own merit. The characters are amazing. Of course the reader ends up loving the protagonists: Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott, but Rowling's talent also shines through strongly in all her supporting and side characters. She did an amazing job at crafting living, breathing characters that leapt off of the page. I could easily visualize all these people. Strike is such a mensch - I love reading about good men, strong men, men I want to snuggle with. :) Strike was very attractive to me - although I WAS disappointed in him when he chose to make a poor sexual decision near the end of the novel. 6'3\", chubby, a bit grumpy, damn good at his job, with past military experience, smart, funny - wow. Knock me over with a feather. What a hottie. :) I also loved the way he tackled the case - he was very thorough and hardworking. He reminded me a bit of another P.I. I adore - Robert B. Parker's Spenser. Robin Ellacott - I liked this character too, although she is engaged to a jackass. I never understand why sane, well-adjusted women in novels end up dating/engaged to/married to jerks. I just don't get it. Matthew is one of those guys that is jealous of her boss. You know, what people nowadays describe as \"alpha,\" this attitude of \"no other man gets to talk with you/see you/be in the same room with you but me\" which is often (in romance novels) portrayed as strong and \"alpha\" but in reality is weak-ass. Being so insecure in your worth as a man and so insecure in the love of your woman that you feel threatened by any other male who gets near her is weak as hell. For some reason Robin puts up with this crap, along with comments about how \"childlike and na\u00efve\" she is and Matthew feeling like he has a right to tell her what jobs she can and can't have. What a jerk. Okay. Bad taste in males aside, Robin is innovative, clever, shows initiative, and has a secret inner yearning to be a P.I. She is a perfect match for Cormoran - who gives her the praise that she is sorely lacking from her fianc\u00e9. And it's not like Cormoran Strike is praising her because he wants to get into her panties, he really genuinely thinks she's amazing. Contrast that with what she has to put up with at home and I cannot understand why she doesn't leave that jackass. Not 'leave him to have a relationship with Cormoran' - just leave him period. The mystery is excellent, it slowly comes together and it is fun to piece it together alongside Strike. I felt like it really worked and was very clever. This book is 455 pages and I didn't feel like any of it was superfluous. It was well-crafted, and didn't go down the paths I expected it to go, especially with confrontations. Oftentimes I thought two people were going to hash it out, and the book would take a different turn - it was exciting and kept me guessing. The writing is wonderful, Rowling has a great way with words. I loved the descriptions, the vocabulary, people's little quirks, - all of it. Very well-written. Rowling also does a good job of tackling race, racism, and the benefits and drawbacks of being biracial - three things that I was surprised she decided to take head-on, but she ended up pulling it off admirably. Another thing I want to note is that while she gives Cormoran a disability, but a disability that he can 'pass' with. That is to say, no one ever HAS to know he has a prosthetic leg unless he WANTS them to know. This allows Rowling to have a disabled character but also allows her to not really have to deal with characters reacting to his disability. A cop-out? I don't know, you decide. I thought it was fine, but other people might have a different take on it. Overall this was a very vibrant and satisfying mystery, full of colorful characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it and definitely plan to read SILKWORM soon. P.S. I did not choose to read this because Rowling wrote it - it had been on my to-read list before she was revealed. If anything, finding out it was Rowling made me a bit hesitant to pick this up. P.P.S. I could NOT get used to characters in the book referring to the paparazzi as \"paps.\" Every single time I read the word \"paps\" I thought about Pap smears. So that was not exactly what I wanted and initially left me very confused. I don't know if this is a British thing, or what? ??? ...more", "Title": "The Cuckoo's Calling"},
