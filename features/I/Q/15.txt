HOW, I ask you, can he come up with a plot this crazily insane (in an awesome way), yet end the book with the WORST CLIFFHANGER IN ALL OF LITERARY HISTORY? Okay, maybe that's a bit of a stretch. I'd say the worst/best cliffy in maybe the last century. Yeah, that's it. But anyway. AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I SWEAR TO GODS, PERCY, YOU HAD BETTER GET YOUR MEMORY AND GET YOUR SORRY HIDE BACK TO NEW YORK OR I WILL FIND A WAY TO GET INSIDE THE BOOK AND KILL YOU . Also, I just had a terrible, horrible, ugly, bad, horrendous, repulsive, monstrous idea. So, at the end of the book, when Jason remembers all that stuff about the Roman camp, he remembers the names of all his friends. Then he remembers this girl and gets kind of uncomfortable because he can't remember what his \"relationship\" was with her- meaning, they definitely liked each other but now he can't remember her, and now he likes Piper (which I find adorable, by the way), so if he goes back, there's going to be some serious girl drama. But actually, the drama isn't my point. My point is- Jason forgot everything, including who his friends were and who he had a crush on (whether it be unrequited or tiny)... and if Percy's hanging at that Roman camp in the Neptune cabin, there's a 99.9999999% chance that he's just like Jason and can't remember anything about CHB or anything else, either (since Annabeth is always right, and all). So does that mean... he likes... SOMEONE ELSE? *throws tantrum* LKJEFKJWE JKERGA ERJGPOAREJ OAREKJG AWOERJ AEOROJG AOER GAOERJOJSHRG ERGKAREKJL That is all.

She is very speshul because 1) her eyes change color (cliche? What? NO!) and 2) she has the VERY RARE gift of charmspeak. 2. And then there was Jason, Piper's love interest. Which they were very, very subtle about. I never saw a connection between them. It seemed like she thought that she should be attracted to him, so she was. 3. Leo. It's too bad, I kind of liked him. But then he got the VERY RARE gift of creating fire from nothing and I laughed. Also, I quickly got sick of the simple writing style. Point of view changes definitely didn't add to the story AT ALL. The quality of writing has plummeted, maybe because Riordan is just plain better at writing in first person. The part at the end where Jason (view spoiler) [doesn't die even though ANYONE ELSE would, because he's SPESHUL (hide spoiler) ] was incredibly frustrating. ...I'm done. ...more Well, I finished re-reading all the Percy Jackson & the Olympians books, so now I'm attempting to re-read all the Heroes of Olympus books as well\u2013\u2013mostly because I wanted to refresh my memory before The Blood of Olympus comes out. After that, no more Percy Jackson ... *sobs* So yeah, I've now finished re-reading this one\u2013\u2013which was a good idea, because as I read it I realized I'd forgotten like 99% of what happened in it.

I also think I liked it a lot better reading it the second time, probably because I'm more familiar with the characters now. The first time I read it, I think I was a little distracted being like, \"but WHERE'S PERCY JACKSON.\" Reading it again and knowing there was no Percy in it, I think I was a bit more invested in the characters. I still am not a huge fan of Jason or Piper, but LEOOOOO. GAHHH. I love Leo so much. (Apparently the first time I read this book I really liked Piper ... ? But I don't know, the second time around I didn't like her much ... Huh.) Well anyway, I'll write a new/longer review at some point. Old/crappy review under the spoiler. (view spoiler) [ Old review (11/13/10): I will come up with an epic review for this soon. But now I need to do the homework I neglected while I was reading it \u2026\u00a0teehee!!! - I find it amusing that this is my 2nd most popular review ... and that I haven't even reviewed it yet. (Oops, I read it almost half a year ago, so I should probably get on that. *headsmack*) ... *AN ETERNITY LATER* ... Well, I was sad that I had nothing to review, but then I remembered that I never reviewed this and had been meaning to do so for ages. I should be reading the 7th Harry Potter book so I can review that\u2013\u2013but, I don't feel like reading right now. And I might as well get this dang thing over with. Gosh darn it. Okay, so, here's the deal. I read this book in November. It's June now. It's been seven months since I read this, so I don't really remember it in detail. Hence, this review will probably totally suck because I am having trouble recalling all the things that happened in this book. I'm sure I took a lot of mental notes, and I bet I was planning some big, epic review ... and then I just didn't want to write it because it was going to be long and time-consuming to write, and yada yada. So, here we are. Yet, oddly enough, of all my reviews this is the one with the second-most amount of votes. Which is rather sad since I sometimes spend like 3 hours writing a review for something and then it gets no votes. *Sobs* All right, all right. Enough of my pity party. So. Rick Riordan. RICK RIORDAN. I love him. And I hate him. He is so wonderful, but so evil. I find this to be true of most of my favorite authors. Anyway, Mr. Riordan has a lot of skill. He creatively ties mythology into reality, and his characters are developed well. His writing isn't the best thing ever, but at least it's funny. I love love loved the Percy Jackson books. It's one of my very favorite series. And I enjoyed the first Kane Chronicles book as well although not as much as Percy Jackson. Aaaand same goes for <+++>The Lost Hero</+++>. I loved it, but not as much as the series from which it originated. I thought it was a \"better\" book, but ... I don't know. I guess I have more of a sentimental attachment to Percy Jackson, since I was part of the whole hype from when I was 12 until I was 16 when the last book came out. So, it's a little hard to let go of that attachment and be like, \"I MISS PERCY!\" But, oh well. So yeah, this book. I guess I'm a little late writing this review, as I've already implied. I don't know if I should really bother going into detail. Well ... I liked that Annabeth was in it. That made me happy. But I MISS PERCY, DANG IT. AND HE WASN'T IN IT AT ALL. IT MADE ME ANGRY. But the other characters were pretty cool. I loved Leo and Piper. They both had cool backstories and were very likable. Jason on the other hand, I didn't like very much. He was just kinda ... ehhh. The whole memory-loss thing made him a bit hard to relate to, because without it he didn't really have a backstory and therefore didn't seem like much of a developed character. He was just being kickass all the time and being like, \"I don't know why I'm so kickass ... I just am! YEAH!\" Well, I hope he'll be a tad more developed in the other books. Aaand the plot, the plot was cool. There were scary monsters and gods and stuff. Hooray for mythology! I liked how in this one, Rick Riordan addressed Roman mythology and how it relates to Greek mythology\u2013\u2013and how there's the Roman camp as well as the Greek one. And then there was the ending. The horrible ending. (view spoiler) [Percy Jackson lost his memory? WONDERFUL. JUST WONDERFUL. Five books for nothing. And herein lies the really annoying problem. Because, you know, you read this and you're like, \"Jason and Piper should be a couple!\" And then you realize that Jason had some other girlfriend at the Roman camp. And then if you think of Percy ... who has Annabeth. Except now he is at the Roman camp, and has forgotten everything as well. And might have met someone else. So, Jason's ex-girlfriend is basically the Annabeth in this situation. MAN, THIS SUCKS. GAHHH. *BASHES HEAD THROUGH A WINDOW* (hide spoiler) ] So anyway, it was good. Definitely has potential to be as kickass as Percy Jackson, but we will have to wait and see about that.

Rick's the man, and he quickly put my mind at ease once I got this book in my hands. I can't believe how much I've missed this world. I loved this book! I don't care that I'm a 34 year old mom of two. I adore this whole series so much! Rick is like, the male JKR, he has the most amazing imagination and it's penned in such a solid pace. It's completely captivating that I just wanted to savor every single word of this 500+ book and before I knew it, I was already done and craving more. There are so many colorful new characters, creatures and monsters to enjoy. Reading this feels like my own little history lesson in mythology. I loved there back stories, there unique talents, there choice of weapons and the magic of it all. We even get to see some of our favorite familiar hero's, but sadly, some aren't here in this book, but hoping Rick will include them in the next. I don't want to give anything away. A lot of great and fun stuff happen in this book. It's more gripping, a little more intense but still the fun and fantastic escape that I've come to rely on, still lives in these pages. Remarkable-Remarkable stuff! <+++>The Lost Hero</+++> is an incredible start to a brand new adventure! Highly entertaining! Highly recommended! For all ages! Read this, it's made of pure awesomesauce! ...more I'll be honest, I liked this Roman series less than the Greek one for a number of reasons. One was their camp wasn't nearly as interesting as Camp Half-Blood. Another was that there was more of an emphasis on pairing up characters and I'm just not a fan of romance. I think another was knowing that I wouldn't get to see the rest of the stories on the big screen since Chris Columbus ruined what would have been a successful film franchise.

However, I finished that series because I wanted to read this one, which I hear is better. And it so is. I really enjoyed the three main characters. I felt that in this book, I could actually relate to them and understand their backstories, whereas I felt no real connection to Percy. Leo reminded me so much of Kenji that I was in love, and Piper is so fleshed-out already and even though we know little about Jason, his honest and refreshing personality made him so, so likeable. I love the mythology in these series; it's just unmatched by anything else out there. Every time the Gods are shown in these books it makes me feel like a puny mortal, and I love how real they seem even though they are so abstract and literally a myth. There were several times in this book wherein a bit of Riordan's typical corny writing comes to play, something I would rather do without but am able to tolerate because there's a lot less of it in this book than there was in the previous series. I listened to the audiobook for this, but I think for the rest i'll be reading it physically since they're so fast and there are so many different characters, it might behoove me. But I can't wait to continue on! ...more I thought the Percy Jackson series was fun, but I like this one a lot more!

Will be reading the rest of this series without a doubt, looking forward to seeing Percy make a return!! ...more THE ENDING. OMFG. Tears literally came to my eyes when I finished this book. I just loved it so much I wanted to cry. Riordan dives right into the story. There were a lot of questions of who everyone's parents were so Piper's godly parent surprised me but it I thought it was pretty cool. Jason's turned out to be what I expected but with a spin. And Leo's was pretty predictable but there is something very unique about him.... Riordan perfectly meshes Greek and Roman mythology. It's ingenious the way he does it.

He uses some of the places he labeled as dangerous in Percy Jackson and the Olympians and twisted them to fit this story line, which was spectacular. And some of the events that took place in the first series make a little more sense once you read The Lost Hero. The characters are wonderful! Throughout the whole book, you're asking questions beyond where's Percy. Riordan gives you just enough answers to appease you but then (a lot of the time) you have more questions you want answered after the new revelations. He perfectly balances the giving and withholding of information. The Heroes of Olympus is definitely, with out a shadow of doubt, going to be better than Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The Lost Hero showed great promise for the sequel, Son of Neptune. The writing is in third person but it has an air of the first person writing you get in the first series. It has three different POVs and each chapter about the targeted character is personalized specifically well. I just love everything about this book. ...more All of my friends seem to have read this series,and I want to start it so much,but I haven't read the Persy Jackson series yet.Can this series be read before Persy Jackson,or is this a prequel or a sequel.And if you have read this,any feedback ?

Yes, even 400-something pages of Greek mythology take that long. And the first thing which I should mention is that this book, and some others which have come before it and all those which will follow, have nothing going for them except for plot. Absolutely nothing. (Well, unless you count occasional hilarious one-liners on the side. I guess I should.) Of course, we can't discuss this book without discussing the original Percy Jackson and the Olympians. What made Percy Jackson such a success? He was new . Some people call him the Harry Potter of the new age, but he was much more interesting than that; a smart-aleck, good-hearted 12-year old who sets out on the ultimate road trip to save the world from a god-scale war. The reader befriends the stumbling hero from page two. We want things to turn out alright for our demon-slaying protagonist, but, peeking from behind our fingers, we also really don't want them to, because the result will be much funnier. The most important thing about Percy was that he evolved over the course of his series. That was probably greatest asset Riordan could have granted to Percy: change. It takes Percy half the first book to even admit to himself that gods are toying around with mortals/demigods; he doesn't fall into the role of leadership until book three, or perhaps book four. But here, in The Lost Hero , our new heroes simply are . Jason is the new Percy, and he fails miserably at the job. Piper, although deeper than the Mary-Suestic (is there a male counterpart to that term?) Jason, will never be as likeable as Annabeth, and Piper's relationship with her father will never reach the depth or strength of the Percy-Sally relationship. The only interesting character of the trio proves to be Leo, who is haunted, a little insecure, and on occasion jealous. But ever since The Last Olympian itself, all of Riordan's books have lacked something. What is it? Soul? There's little life in the writing style of the The Lost Hero . Gone are the mirthful chapter titles of the Olympian series (e.g. \"I Accidentally Vaporize my Pre-Algebra Teacher\"), and the sassy first-person tone of voice which worked so well in Percy's case will never again be. The third-person narration in this book distances us from the characters. There\u2019s little to no illustrative description. The focus is instead of bland action and scenes which we have already encountered countless times. Needless to say, all of this becomes a little tiring. Riordan is trying to write a different series about different heroes in a different voice, but he has retained the writing style of the previous books, something which should not have happened. But hey, all in all, there\u2019s some fun to it. Although redundant, The Lost Hero avoids being boring. Sure, the plot structure is terrible (Evil powers are rising! Go on a quest! Leo, save the day! Piper, save the day! Jason, save the day! Boss battle, everyone \u2013 with the aid of a dues-ex-machina, of course, the fourth in a row!), but I was loathe to the put the book down, and that must say something. There was a great deal of focus on who finds what other character attractive, which irked me (someone tell me, where did this trend start?), and I was really surprised that the characters are initially are older than the targeted reading age group, since authors generally want to have as much connection with the reader as possible. I know that Riordan wanted to pick up where the Olympians left off, but maybe our new heroes could\u2019ve hung around Nico, or something. The best aspect of the book, I think, is the whole dual idea of Greek and Roman camps, which means that this series will have just as much character-character conflict as character-bad guy conflict, if not more. The part which will doubtlessly hold readers on tenterhooks is the news of what has happened to Percy. Although this plot thread was not entirely unprecedented (Riordan has become about as suave as Suzanne Collins in his plot twists), I have to admit I was a little heartbroken, and now I nervously await the next installment. Speaking of that\u2026 I am clearly very curious about the next book in the series. It will be titled The Son of Neptune , and, if I\u2019m not mistaken, there will be a great deal of focus on a greatly beloved character. But I am afraid that Percy will not be Percy. What is he now? Seventeen? He\u2019ll never again be the slightly na\u00efve but courageous middle-schooler who chose to journey to the Underworld, granted, but I wish that Riordan could bridge that gap and take us to the old world of Percy Jackson once again. ...more Last weekend I drew a 12yr old girl named Ashley(I'm a caricature/portrait artist, for those who don't know).

Now its not with rage so I assume they like the sketch. Then I realize it was because I was having an in-depth conversation with their 12yr old about a book written for 12yr olds(ish). That got me thinking, maybe I should limit my YA books. After all I'm serious adult with a serious job of making fun of peoples faces, maybe all my book choices should be serious as well. .....Nah..... They just entertain me, like The Last Hero did. This book is a continuation of the Percy Jackson books, which is a story about demi gods. Kids that are half human and half god (think Greek gods) and the quests they must go on. On these quests they run into all sorts of mythological creatures, like Medusa, cyclopes, satyrs and the like. It's all a great big ball of fun, and I know more about Greek mythology then I thought I ever would. I enjoyed The Last Hero, who cares if only tons of 12yr olds agree. ...more LOVED this book!

Perhaps Riordan had some sort of \"writer's-high\" when he was writing the Olympians, but it was a surprise to see this level of quality. I had expected Riordan to really blow us away again.........either I'm hypercritical, or Riordan really has lost it. There may be spoilers\u2026if there are, well, consider your reading this as a game of review roulette. I must point out that Riordan's writing and language have also taken the slide down the hill. I noticed he started to use (pardon my bluntness) \"bigger\" words that I reckon few sixth-graders, his audience, would be comfortable with. Trust me, I've read enough books to realize that when an author starts going all sixteen-letters on you, it's an attempt to balance the lower quality of story with a thin veil of unecessarily ornate language. Another thing; characters. The characters did not seem very well created at all. Maybe they get better, but I couldn't imagine a kid fighting off storm spirits like a pro. (He can't remember who he is, I got that far. Is he a great hero? he couldn't remember anyway, so his fighting skills would have left him.) And also, and this is the kicker really, all his characters were like a bad second-grade play (that's saying something). You know what I mean, the, 'I can see the kid's legs sticking out of the horse but I'll pretend clap anyway'. They were just pawns, they're motives always seemed to coincide where Riordan wanted the plot to go. There was no real decisions by them, you could just about see where they were going to go. And now for the groaning. A museum? Seriously? A museum where a demigod realizs that something is amiss........where have we heard that before? Could it have been....in the first book? The beginning of The Lightning Thief? No, Riordan is too good a writer to have used the same opening, is he? Unfortunately, the answer is no. It appears as if he may have lost it. And before die-hard fans plague me with hate-mail, let me say this, I have not finished the entire book yet. Perhaps amidst the pages of print he recaptures his former glory. I'll have to find out. More when I stop procrastinating and read the book already. UPDATE At long last, I'm done with the book. And, now, you ask, did I repent and and learn to love Riordan again? The answer, is a no. This is the first book in a while that I have been emarrassed to be caught reading. Why does everything sound so much like the first ones? Come on man! They're exactly the same. This could be just me, but I felt a strong loyalty to the original characters, our heroes we knew. Now this, this, Jason-boy, this upstart comes out of nowhere and is suddenly the greatest person who ever lived. I hate him. And Okay. I'll buy the fact that Jason's memory was washed and he doesnt freak out and go insane. I'll even buy the fact that he is born with instinctive judo skills (?). But where the heck did this Roman camp come from? Never mentioned before. 'Oh its because the gods kept it a secret'. Wow. That seemes like an awfully convenient excuse to write a new series... It's like writing a whole historical fiction novel about Germany's struggle to get an air force together, and then throwing in, \"Sure is lucky we trained all those fighting flying unicorns, eh Friedrich?\" Now for characters, I'll avoid Jason, because everybody already knows my feelings on him. This is a good time to get up, use the bathroom, and grab some popcorn. Get ready for the rant. Piper then. She was okay for the most part, but in my opinion, her entire point of being alive is to be Jason's girlfriend. Seriously, just, get a life. He is not the answer to life the universe and everything (not 42 is he?). Think, why did everybody like Annabeth, even though she pretty much had the same feelings? First off, she wasn't totally obsessed. She didn't really talk about it at all, just subtle hints here and there. There was no guessing. We all knew what Jason thought of Piper, and vice versa. What sort of a love plot is that? Leo was excessive. Riordan took his role as comic-relief a little to far. How many teens would stare down the eyes of death and crack a joke? Not realistic enough. Other than that, he pretty much is a blah character. The way I see it, riordan put him in there for two reasons: comic relief, and because every book has to have two guys and a girl. I did NOT like how it was told by three people. It's not my taste, and ruins the tension for me. See, this is another reason why Piper's hopeful relationship was so open- she gets her own viewpoint in the story. Where's the fun in that? For me, the plot was constructed, and then the characters thrown in like squarepegs and round holes. I know I know, plot comes first, but here the plot was driving the characters. Riordan might as well have written this: Character A looked at the burning bridge. \"Where did that asteroid come from?\" Character C: \"This must be a sign we should cross somewhere else.\" \"But then we'll take an extended detour witch will invariably lead us into the lairof some monster,\" said Character B. \"Well at least we'll find out something from one of our pasts while dangling over boiling water. That should advance the plot.\" I suggest you read this book in a sleeping bag. When you're finished, it'll keep you from kicking all your friends who said it was amazing, or kicking yourself for wasting seventeen dollars on the hard-cover. All in all, a DO NOT READ if you liked the Percy Jackson series, or like good books, or frankly, books in general. Of course, if youve never read the first series, you might hate it slightly less than myself. ...more (4.5 stars) People where not joking when they said it was even better than the Percy Jackson books! Cannot wait to get book 2! Possibly more like a 3.5 because it was great to be back in the world in general, but I'm not sold on all of the new characters yet. It was so much fun to see some old faces though!

Let's do this.\u201d Wow, i have to say, this series seemed addicting right from the start. As soon as i heard about this spin off series, i had to read it. But first, i had to finish the last two books of Percy Jackson . They did not disappoint. And this one didn't disappoint it as well. I actually love it more than i love PJ books. This story/characters and everything else are more... serious, i think? And thats what i loved about it. Of course, i missed Percy and all the other characters from the previous books, but it wasn't really a problem. The writing style changed , its not first person view, it's in third person view. Also, this books follows three POVs - Leo,Jason & Piper. Somehow this style made me love the book even more, because its the writing style i love the most. It's not neccessary to read PJ books if you wanna read these. But i suggest you do it. The characters from PJ books still appear, and there are many stories which have been told in those books. Stories you may not really understand unless you have read them. This series combines Roman and Greek mythology this time, and it was fantastic. ____________________________________________ STORY : ____________________________________________ If you read PJ before, you should remember the prophecy that was spoken at the end of the fifth book. This prophecy is the plot of this series. \u201cSeven half-bloods shall answer the call. To storm or fire, the world must fall. An oath to keep with a final breath, And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.\u201d Once upon a time, the gods made children with mortals. Those children had abilities of their mothers and fathers and were called demigods. In the last century or so, Zeus forbid the main trio of gods (Zeus,Hades and Poseidon) to have any children - because they are powerful and can be lethal and dangerous foes. But, there were some exceptions and now, there are some demigods who were overlooked. The demigods who survived until their 16th have to go to Camp Half-Blood for safety - because monsters and various creatures are out there and they don't like children of gods. Percy Jackson followed story of Poseidon's son - Percy, and Annabeth, daughter of Athena and so on... New foes are rising - the world still isn't safe. Worst of all, heroes of camp half blood are in a panic because their leader, Percy Jackson, went missing. And the appearance of the 3 teenagers, Piper,Leo and Jason makes it even more confusing for them. ____________________________________________ CHARACTERS : ____________________________________________ \u2666 Jason speaks Latin, calls the gods in the Roman names and doesn't remember a thing. He doesn't remember how he got on a bus. He doesn't remember who he is or where he came from. Piper is his so-called girlfriend, and Leo is his \"best friend\". \u2666 Piper Piper has to choose between things she would never sacrifice, but choosing the wrong side may ruin her life. And the lives of those who are dear to her. \u2666 Leo is a type who never fit in anywhere - he cracks up jokes, is sarcastic, and he has a habit of running away. All of that to escape the painful history he had, and to hide the pain he still feels. Characters from Camp Half-Blood still appear, like Annabeth, Clarisse and some others, but i was sad because there was no Nico, or Percy in this book. But they will appear in the next one so i am already hyped for more. Anyway, Leo is so far my favorite character, and my heart broke because of what he had been through. His life is shattered and forces of evil are trying to break him. If they break him, they win. Jason was okayish, as was Piper, but so far, Leo won me over. \u201cPiper gripped his hand and followed him, \u201cIf I fall, you\u2019re catching me.\u201d \u201cUh, sure.\u201d Jason hoped he wasn\u2019t blushing. Leo stepped out next. \u201cYou\u2019re catching me, too, Superman. But I ain\u2019t holding your hand.\u201d *** \u201cLeo choked. \"Your mom is a rainbow goddess?\" \"Got a problem with that?\" Butch said. \"No, no,\" Leo said. \"Rainbows, very macho.\" \"Butch is our best equestrian,\" Annabeth said. \"He gets along great with the pegasi.\" \"Rainbows, ponies,\" Leo muttered. \"I'm gonna toss you off this chariot,\" Butch warned.\u201d ____________________________________________ OVERALL : ____________________________________________ I freaking love this book. That's all i can say. I believe PJ fans will love it too, but even those who have never read PJ before. Riordan's style of writing and his storytelling is just addicting. And i loved everything about it. That is all.

The three friends embark on a quest to rescue a captured Hera and fulfill a new prophecy. My enjoyment of the Lost Hero was hindered by the fact that I disliked Jason, the leader of the gang. His only skills are essentially the ones he was born with, his powers as a son of Zeus. Besides that, he basically just swings his sword around a bunch and makes people jealous of him. I had no admiration for him as a leader; he didn't earn that position through his actions, but through his birthright. I also wasn't a huge fan of the Piper/Jason pairing. It diminished Piper's importance in the story. Piper could have been so strong and awesome, with her intelligence and charmspeak, but she just spent most of the book fawning over Jason. That pricked my feminist side a little. My favorite, no question, is Leo. He is the unsung hero of the series so far. He's smart, charming, funny, incredibly handy, and emotionally strong in spite of all the hurt he's suffered in the past. It annoyed me whenever Leo envied Jason - Leo is so much better! Not that it's a contest, anyway. I'm reading the whole series this month! Should be fun. I've heard Percy shows up again in the next one. ...more Book Review (down there somewhere) ***Thoughts Before Reading*** Just bought it today!

Actually I'm gonna buy the Hunger Games paperback instead since I want my own copy of it but unfortunately it was out of stock and this one caught my eye. __________________ ***Book Review*** ***Introduction*** First off let me start by saying that reading the dedication part of this book made me almost cried again. I've already written the Riordan/Haley story in my review of The Lightning Thief but in case you've never heard of it I tell the story once more.(If you know it already you can skimmed through) So Rick Riordan is a Greek mythology teacher in middle school and he used to tell Greek bedtime stories to his son Haley and eventually he ran out of myths so he think of creating a new story for Haley. So here is the part that struck me Haley was diagnosed to have ADHD and dyslexia and that's the reason why Percy Jackson is created as a demigod with ADHD and dyslexia. I have to admit that when I've first heard about the story I cried because I think that what Riordan did for Haley was really sweet and it shows that he really loves Haley no matter what. As a nursing student I know that sometimes parents with ADHD/dyslexic kids view the condition as a bad thing and most often the not feel depressed about it and blame themselves for their child's condition. That's why Family counseling was also important with managing ADHD. And what Rick Riordan did is very inspirational especially to those kids and parents who have conditions like ADHD and dyslexia. That's why knowing that Percy Jackson Series became a bestseller is a really good thing for me. So I just like to say Mr. Riordan kudos to you in your future works and I'll always be a fan of yours. --Okay intro over, Book Review Time!-- For Those who haven't read the book yet... What's To Expect In This Book: 1. It's Percy Jacksonish, meaning if you like Percy Jackson you'll like this one too. 2. New Characters: Jason(a kid who just have an amnesia), Piper (a kid who has the power of persuasion, she thought that she was Jason's girlfriend, he's dad was kidnapped) and Leo (he's talent is making tools, armors etc.) 3. Different Character Perspectives: Jason, Piper and Leo (Note: Having this one have pros and cons.) Pros: You'll get to know the character better (character creation more effective this time) Cons: This will slows the plot, the exposition alone will eat up half of the book, the quest will start halfway of the book) 3. Humor- Every page never fails to crack me up. 4. Adventure- (New Quest, New Prophecy, New Mythologies, emphasis on Roman Mythologies now) 5. Romance- Still Rick Riordan Style (Subtle and Cute) 6. Element of Surprise- Some of the things like the claiming of who their God moms or dads surprised me. 7. The surprise at the end pawned! Can't wait for the next one! 8. A glossary of the gods at the end of the book (love it!>.<) My Spoilery Review For those who have already read it. ***Just scroll down*** Myspace Funny Picture Comments Myspace Funny Picture Comments & Graphics Myspace Funny Picture Comments & Graphics Graphics for Funny Picture Comments OH MY GODS! or should I say HOLY HEPHAESTUS! I was really excited with this new camp of other Roman demigods and WTH Percy Jackson and Jason switch places!!! I swear I need the next book right now. Rick Riordan how can you do this to me!!! I'm hyperventilating right now lol Yeah and I really love the characters, they're like so cool and cute and funny. Leo was the joker of the group and I really really love him. I wish that in the next one he can have a girlfriend or whatever. And it's so cute that he had a crush on Thalia. Poor thing Thalia was already hunter of Artemis meaning no boys for her. I love Piper too at the start I felt like annoyed by her because she reminds me of Angel from The Angel Experiment since they have the same power and she also reminds me of Tally from Uglies (the betrayer and double agent thingy). When she was claimed as Aphrodite's daughter I was like WTH is Rick Riordan's thinking O.o??? It's just from the previous books Aphrodite was projected as superficial and stupid but however I was wrong. Piper is one of the strongest female heroines you'll meet and I love her. She's beautiful but she's also strong, loyal and smart she actually reminds me of Hermione from Harry Potter Series. And I love what she said to Drew at the end that, \"don't even look at Jason Grace. He may not know it yet, but he's mine. If you even try to make a move, I will load you into a catapult and shoot you across Long Island Sound.\" And I was like You Go Bitch Girl!!! Love, love that scene. And Jason OMG can I say he reminds me of Percy Jackson well he's really cute and strong too. I really like the way that he's amnesiac and all and he was confused about Piper and all that. I really love that he can fly well he kind of remind me of Ueki from Law of Ueki. I love the scene wherein he catches Piper while she's falling that was really sweet.*swoons* Wow. I felt like I have so many things to say, shout, yell whatever. Gosh it's making me crazy!!!

I LIKE. I had a rocky start to Riordan's first Percy Jackson series. I mean it was cute and quirky buuuuut...it lacked the punch. The Lost Hero had the PUNCH. The plot was way more complex and I loved being in 3 character's heads instead of just one. And the 3rd person? LOVED IT. I'm being converted into a Riordan fangirl. #notevensad So we have 3 POVs: Jason, Piper, and Leo. I was wary that it'd be another Annabeth/Percy/Grover trio BUT NOPE. Their personalities were completely different. THIS? I LIKE. I had a rocky start to Riordan's first Percy Jackson series. I mean it was cute and quirky buuuuut...it lacked the punch.

I'm being converted into a Riordan fangirl. #notevensad So we have 3 POVs: Jason, Piper, and Leo. I was wary that it'd be another Annabeth/Percy/Grover trio BUT NOPE. Their personalities were completely different. It kills me to pick a favourite, but I really really like this trio. I mean, I love Annabeth and Percy, but there was so much mystery surrounding these three. So much backstory. I just kept gobbling pages wanting answers. (Note: I did not get all the answers because IT'S A DANG SERIES. GAH. Give me Son of Neptune ASAP.) + JASON: Got to admit, he's my least favourite. He's the typical \"mysterious hero\" material, like a cliche with fabulous looks, tattoos and amnesia. Where is Jason from? Who is he? Why does he randomly speak Latin? SOMEONE ANSWER ME. But he felt...flat? He's the kind of kid that does no wrong in attempt to do all right. The leader. The worthy one. The true hero. Blah blah, etc. BO-RING. + PIPER: I loved her! She's not as feisty and bitter as Annabeth. She's got a real soft side, she's a bit of a kleptomaniac, and she's got an interesting sub-plot going on. SHe's also 1/2 Cherokee, which is nice and refreshing to have diversity! YAY. + LEO: Easily my most FAVOURITE CHARACTER EVER. He's funny! He has firey hands. He's a whiz at making things and is usually covered in grease. I think he's Hispanic? (Idek, don't expect me to pay attention to details. Omg, I relate to demi-gods so much it's a little scary.) But he's so fuuuuuny. He's the side-kick, the comic relief, and everyone totally takes him for granted. I love you, Leo. You are easily the best character in the book. The plot followed the typical Send-Kids-On-Potentially-Lethal-Quest format that all Riordan's books have. I mean, technically this is the sixth book of his I've read with this layout. IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW, EH? But nope. Not complaining, though, since these one had more plot twists and interesting prophecies and intriguing characters and gnarly action scenes. The quest was tougher. LOVE IT. Although, I do have to admit.... The book is way too freaking long. It's like nearly 600-pages. WHY?! There were so many little detours that just grew a bit wearying. Go to A which'll send you to B and bypass C to spend two chapters in D. I get it: that's the layout of the plot. But there was so. much. TOO MUCH. But the imagination?!! It's incredible! And the detail! I'm not a Greek myth buff, but I lovelovelove how so many of the mythology is used and how it's twisted into modernness. OMG AND THE CHARACTERS! The supporting cast is just amazing . And even if we just meet some wacko god for a second, they're so vivid and interesting and...insane. I'm in awe of Riordan's imagination, seriously. There are a few returning characters from the first series! Won't deny it: I screeched when I recognised people! Thalia plays a bigger part, and Annabeth has a lot of book time. Percy is missing. Grover wasn't mentioned. Clarisse got a quick mention at the end. I basically enjoyed it a lot and LOVED the cliffhanger. I need The Son of Neptune ASAP, is all I can say after that delicious last sentence. I enjoyed the more meatiness of this plot and the maturity of the characters. I adored laughing my head off at the perfect quips. I'm easily sold to loving these new characters, but, ya know, if Jason gets more interesting that would be epic. \u201cWhat about a compromise? I\u2019ll kill them first, and if it turns out they were friendly, I\u2019ll apologize.\u201d Cute, smart, and violent. Jason wished he remembered having her as a girlfriend. \u201cIf possible, try to avoid pushing each other over the edge, as that would cause me extra paperwork.\u201d ...more Before I get into the review I just want to say something about what happened to me when I was reading this book. You can skip this little story time if you want. The other day I was sitting in class and was reading The Lost Hero and my friend (we're not close at all) behind me saw me reading it. She told me she really liked the series so we talked about it. Then she started going into to detail.

I quickly st Before I get into the review I just want to say something about what happened to me when I was reading this book. You can skip this little story time if you want. The other day I was sitting in class and was reading The Lost Hero and my friend (we're not close at all) behind me saw me reading it. She told me she really liked the series so we talked about it. Then she started going into to detail. She said \u201coh I can\u2019t believe what happens in the third book\u201d and was about to spoil me. I quickly stopped her and told her not to spoil me because I\u2019m only up to the first book and she said okay. The two seconds later (I\u2019m not even kidding) she goes so you know when blah blah happens and spoils me. I was so confused because I was still on the first book so I told that I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about and that I\u2019m not up to that. She then told me that it was in the first book so then I was like I am not lying when I say this but she did again like three times and spoiled me a lot. I was getting so mad. She could not get the message and DIDN\u2019T STOP! On the inside, I was like She ruined so many things for me and she even tried to do it again with a different series but I turned around and ignored her. Actual Review I really liked this book and I think that this series will be much better than Percy Jackson and the Olympians . This book was full of action and I putting it down was really hard. I loved everything about this series and it was so good!! I was never bored because something was always happening. This book is spectacular and I can\u2019t wait to read The Son of Neptune . I just want to devour the rest of the series and I am so glad that I don\u2019t have to wait and can read the book very soon. This series is based after Percy Jackson and the Olympians and follows the story of new characters; Jason, Leo and Piper who discover they are demigods and go to Camp Half-Blood. They go on the quest and the book follows their adventure. (Sorry this is a terrible description but I am awful at describing books). We meet new characters and reunite with old ones. I know this series is a middle-grade series but it doesn\u2019t really matter at all and I think all ages can enjoy this book. The book follows the perspective of all three characters which is something that is really great about this book. It allows the reader to really explore the different personalities of the characters and gives different perspectives on the situations. Sometimes reading books with multiple POVs it not that great but with this book it was a benefit. Although this was a great book I feel it was just too similar to the Percy Jackson series. It the same sort of idea and that kind of bothered me because I wanted something more original and different. Although it was similar I feel like this was a much better version of the series and it was much funnier too. It had to more twists which really kept me engrossed. I really miss Percy. (view spoiler) [ I could really feel the effect of his absence since he was not only mine but probably one of everyone\u2019s favourite characters. Although, I did really like the mystery surrounding his disappearance. I was spoiled and already knew about the second camp so I kind of had a feeling that was where he was so it wasn\u2019t as big of a surprise which really bothered me. (hide spoiler) ] My favourite character would have to be Leo with Jason closely following after. Leo was so funny and I just loved him so much. He really lightened the mood and he made everything so much better. Without him, the series wouldn\u2019t have been as good. Here are some of the funny things he\u2019s said: It'll be dangerous,\" Nyssa warned him. \"Hardship, monsters, terrible suffering. Possibly none of you will come back alive.\" \"Oh.\" Suddenly Leo didn't look so excited. Then he remembered everyone was watching. \"I mean... Oh, cool! Suffering? I love suffering! Let's do this.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re catching me, too, Superman. But I ain\u2019t holding your hand.\u201d \"I try very hard to be annoying,\" Leo said. \"Don't insult my ability to annoy. OMG OMG OMG OMG I was just searching up quotes and then I accidently saw a spoiler in the search bar. IT WAS A REALLY BIG SPOILER!!! I really hope it was a lie because I have had enough spoilers about this series. I also really liked Coach Hedge as he also added humour to the book when he said stuff like this \u201cWhat about a compromise? I\u2019ll kill them first, and if it turns out they were friendly, I\u2019ll apologize.\u201d Overall, this is a great book and I think everyone of all ages should read this book. It really lifts up your mood. Everything about it is amazing and most of the characters are really likeable.

I should probably clarify I've never done drugs, but you know what people say (besides \"they're bad\"): They're addictive, and if you stop using them all of a sudden, symptoms of abstinence are going to present themselves. That is what happened to me. I read the Percy Jackson books in no time, and then when I spent 2 and a half days without reading anything related, one of the biggest book hangovers in my life started. But gratefully, I discovered this series and I didn These books are like drugs. I should probably clarify I've never done drugs, but you know what people say (besides \"they're bad\"): They're addictive, and if you stop using them all of a sudden, symptoms of abstinence are going to present themselves. That is what happened to me. I read the Percy Jackson books in no time, and then when I spent 2 and a half days without reading anything related, one of the biggest book hangovers in my life started. But gratefully, I discovered this series and I didn't wait more to start it. Maybe I flew through this book because it's set in PJ's world and we get to meet old characters, or maybe because I already understood the world, so I didn't need to process new information besides the twists of the plot. Well... I take that back. There was indeed new information, because now Riordan mixed Greek and Roman mythology. Anyway, this book starts three months after The Last Olympian ended. Now instead of the trio we got to know in the PJ series we have Jason, Piper and Leo. They're not a copy of the previous trio, if that's what you were thinking - each of those characters are different and have their own charms. As you may be guessing, they're demigods. Leo is a son of Hephaestus, Piper a daughter of Aphrodite, and Jason... doesn't remember a thing about his life. Turns out they need to save the world of a new apocalypse, one that's even worse that the one the war in book 5 of PJ could have caused. To add more trouble to that, no one has seen Percy for three days. What does this apocalypse have to do with Jason's amnesia and Percy's disappearance? Could it be the next Great Prophecy started? How are they going to deal with it this time? The plot has the same old and formulaic structure all the books in the PJ series has, but it was much more mature. There are less Deus Ex Machinas, and the characters don't get into so many traps. Oh, speaking about the characters... Should I mention the fact that they're so diverse? Piper's a part Native American, Leo is Latino (hell yeah, and he was awesome), there are Asians as well as Americans, etc, etc, and I liked... most of them. Out of the new trio, my favourite is definitely <---C>Leo Valdez</---C>. He's a badass, whose mother was a mechanical engineer, so he knows a little about machines, and he's funny as hell. Sometimes his jokes were lame and immature, but I loved his backstory and everything that went through his mind. I cannot say the same for the rest of the team. Piper's way too perfect. She's oh so pretty, and everyone's telling her so every page. By the end of the series, probably all the men and maybe most of the women will have a crush on her. Seriously. No one is so perfect - not even a child of Aphrodite. And Jason... I didn't like the guy a lot. His amnesia and all the mystery around him, while intriguing, was also annoying, especially more because when he woke up after he lost his memories, he was holding hands with Piper, so all the time he kept saying \"I wish I remembered having a girlfriend like this girl. She's so beautiful and intellingent. I'd be so lucky.\" It was annoying after a while. And should I mention what romance there was in this book was just as... not annoying, but awkward ? No, no, it's not angsty, and neither does it take the central stage, however... it felt a little forced, you know? I mean, I understand why Piper would have a crush on Jason, but Jason on Piper? That's just instalove (although some may call it Aphrodite's influence). Why else would he think about kissing the girl every time he looked at her? They didn't know each other. But it wasn't annoying, thank God. What annoyed me a lot was Drew and her hatred towards Piper because 1) she's pretty, and 2) because she has Jason's attention, and Drew wants Jason all for herself because he's oh so handsome. Look, I know girl hate because of something so stupid exists in real life, but I hate when it appears in books as if it weren't a bad thing. What's worse is that Piper herself indulges and starts competing with Drew for Jason: \"In case you think I\u2019m not a true daughter of Aphrodite,\u201d Piper said, \u201cdon\u2019t even look at Jason Grace. He may not know it yet, but he\u2019s mine . If you even try to make a move, I wil load you into a catapult and shoot you across Long Island Sound\" I was like wtf?!? Isn't this supposed to be a book for children? What are you teaching them?! Another thing that annoyed me was the immaturity of some characters. I know , children's book. It's supposed to be funny for them, but not for me. I can barely tolerate 17-year-olds acting like children, but adults it's way worse. I'm talking about Coach Hedge, by the way. I didn't like how he acted - like he was an idiot and kept making stupid jokes in life-or-death moments. Please, control your immaturity, leave jokes for other moments and stop acting like a 10-year-old. Hell, not even my 10yo brother would act like that in a threatening situation! But still the book was very entertaining. It had a horrible cliffhanger (thank the gods all the books are already published) and now I just need to know more. Off to devour book 2! ___________________ Pre-review: I did not just read a 500+ pages book in less than 12 hours. This did not happen. Your mind is tricking you. Jk. This thing was so damn addictive! And that finale... I NEED TO KEEP ON READING. Rick Riordan, what have you done to me?!?! RTC... In the meanwhile, I'll try not to start book 2, because if I do, I'm dead. I won't stop and I'll never write this review. Let's hope I can contain myself for once in my life. ...more I enjoyed this more than the last few Percy Jackson books! I found it really refreshing to have new characters in this world, while still having a few familiar faces around too. I liked the blending of the Greek and Roman mythologies. Really, it's about the characters. Rick and his (still) cheater narration make me care about them. So I will be continuing this series. Has anybody thought of the fact that Percy has an empathy link with Grover? So Grover could, in theory, contact Percy when the latter's still an amnesiac. I wonder if Riordan's thought of this... * Note : If you want the actual review, go down . But if you are willing to read through my rambling critique of the preview chapters, by all means, go ahead.

In this context it refers to the narration a book has - first-person, second-person (very rare and hard to do), and third-person; there might be some others, but they don't come into play here. POV is also a very annoying aspect of a particularly hard essay called a DBQ, but I won't get into that. * So, this here is the review for the preview chapters. It says it's a spoiler; it's not. (view spoiler) [Before anything else, I'll say this: DO NOT, and I mean do not , read these two chapters before the whole book comes out. You will a. be tortured with questions and b. find the book not so interesting overall. Trust me - I've been cursed with this, but you don't have to be! That said, After previewing the first two chapters, I can definitely say this: A. YESSSS! B. NOOOO! C. WHAAAT??? D. REALLY? Let me explain: A. This book isn't set far after The Last Olympian , and we have three new, awesome characters and a good plot. And a kick-a** satyr! All Grover did was bleat, run and throw tin cans. B. First off, we have the same setup as the last series: three people (main character {un-popular guy}, best friend 1 {smart-a** girl}, best friend 2 {goofy sidekick guy}), who (and I'm guessing here) have to go retrieve something/someone, while learning who they exactly are along the way. Second, although I really do adore Riordan and his marvelous stories, they really are for younger kids, especially this series. The Percy Jackson books were written fine, and I haven't read the Kane Chronicles yet, but don't compare him or his writing to that of, say, J.K. Rowling , who is (personally) the best writer ever. Someone I know compared Riordan's books to the Twilight series, but I'll say that his books are better than Stephenie Meyer 's simply because the plot is better (I mean, mythology of any kind over vampire/werewolf love stories any day). Thirdly, the first mention of a grey-eyed blonde I saw I cheered - here comes Annabeth! But she was really out of character, stomping around and nasty tempered like a four-year-old who's just lost their favorite toy (and I would know). And of course, all the mysterious phrases she and the other guy (maybe a son of Iris, but the name Butch? Really?) made everything even more frustrating, even though all old fans understood them. The point was that the new characters didn't, and Annabeth was acting like a baby. Really, Riordan? C. By giving up these two chapters, Riordan may have tried to get more people hooked onto this new series, and he's probably succeeded, but it's also spoiled everything for me. It's also made the whole world, life, the universe and everything infinitesimally more confusing. Also, Riordan didn\u2019t do the best job with the fight scene - I mean, I've been to the Grand Canyon, and I don't get falling into the Canyon and still living, even if it's a demigod doing it. I can get falling from the St. Louis Arch. I dig a fight scene in the Air and Space Museum. But being tossed from the Grand Canyon? Please, no. D. Must everything come back to Percy? I mean, I like him, he's my favorite character in the series, but if everything comes back to Percy then that means Riordan has more character development for him, and I think a whole book series was enough to explore him. And I know the story won't be all about him, but he's a driving factor, instead of a cool, older-than-the-main-characters adviser (sort of like Luke was in the first P.J. book, but this time no double-crossing traitorous activities, please), and I think that as much as we all love Percy, we honestly don't want him influencing things in this series. True, that'll probably be his role later on in sequels, and this is probably the best way for Riordan to introduce old characters to new books, and...shoot, I'm starting to contradict myself. I'll stop before this review exceeds the length of the preview chapters. But of course, I\u2019m being too harsh. Riordan\u2019s style of writing is always enjoyable, and this is very good introduction-to-YA book for the younger middle school kids. Indeed, I started reading P.J. when I was in seventh grade, even before I discovered Harry Potter. In short, the chapters are okay, the book\u2019ll grow on me and anybody else stupid enough to read the sample chapters then stew over them for a while, and anybody who\u2019ll discover the series later on will be lucky. I still gave it a four, because I still love it, despite everything else.

(hide spoiler) ] * Hi. That (\u2191) was my rambling after I read the first two chapters, but not before I finished the book. Now, I am more informed. Comments on the book: A. I like the characters, I really do. Why? Well, I'll get to POV later, but anyway, I like how we get major character development for more than one character. I'm not saying that the PJ series didn't cultivate other characters besides Percy, but...we really get to see the sidekick and the girl and how their personalities effect others, and how their characters themselves change. Each person has to discover something about themselves, about other people. I'm not saying that the PJ series needed that; the opposite, actually, because having a one-person centered story for an introductory series (like, Sabriel {follows one person} vs. Lirael and Abhorsen {which follow, oh, four or five people, including a cat}) is easier on readers, easier for the author in a way, and smoothly introduces a world, story and all the strings attached to it. So, anyway, love the three-person character development. B. POV. As I've said above, I like the POV. Riordan made a really good choice in his POV; look above for my ramblings about why, but...just having Jason's POV would not be good, because, hello, Jason's lost his memory, and even though it's interesting, Riordan would be forced to harp on that fact so many times that you'd be cursing Hera for taking Jason's memory away in the first place. Whew. Anyway, yeah. POV is good. C. Oh, I dunno. How about plot? So, the plot and all adventures thereof. In all of Riordan's books (well, at least the Greek mythological ones), you find the Greek myths. The gods, the Heroes (Theseus makes a minor appearance, and Hercules is referred to multiple times), and all those other interesting things (Monsters - the Sphinx, Medusa, Procrustes...; places - the Lotus-blossom island {rechristened the Lotus casino by Riordan}, the Underworld, the Styx and Lethes rivers) that make these book truly amazing. And Riordan fuses these aspects perfectly with modern life (The Yellow Triangle being the Sea of Monsters, for example)! I have no idea how he does it so well, but it's why these books are so popular, and rightly so. Wait. This isn't the plot. So, rename this \"Kcatty's love of Greek mythology\", or something like that, and let's leave it at that. D. Now we have the plot. In the PJ series, this was the basic plot: There's this prophecy out there, of which Percy is the one it prophesizes (although sometimes he isn't, and in the end he is and isn't at the same time). Never mind the fact that he has no idea what it dictates will happen to him. In this series (let's call it the HOO series), we have a new prophecy and new characters, but some old ones too. But there's one important aspect to this series that was left out of the PJ series, and understandably so: the demigods that we know of are offspring of the Greek gods, but there's a whole other camp with the Roman gods (not different entities, just different personalities of the Greek gods - that's why Thalia and Jason are siblings, even though technically their fathers are different personalities). And guess what - the two camps hate each other. But the gods have amnesia-ted the leader of the (well, I'm calling them the Romans)(aka, Jason Grace), and done the same to the leader of the Greeks (ahem, Perseus Jackson). Then they transported the two to their respective other camps (Percy to the Romans, Jason to the Greeks), because of this prophecy. This is one thing I'm not liking about this series - more character development for Percy. As I've said above, I think six books, with 1st-person POV and devoted solely to the kid himself, would be enough. But, no! Percy has to lose his memory and have to have his character redefined all over again. Grr! But hopefully Riordan uses some technicality so that Percy doesn't completely go amnesiatic, and can hold on to his senses. (ahem, I'd look at the top of this review for a possible loophole) But otherwise, the book has good plot (and more subplots too - go read J.K. Rowling 's books and you'll see why they're so important to a book). The motivations and personalities of each character is realistic, capturing and important to the reader. It's a really good book. This is a 4. It's not a 5 because almost nothing in by book gets a 5. [Comment 12/09/2011: Except for SoN. SoN ROCKS.] ...more", "Title": "The Lost Hero"},
