And the premise, that characters can exist in the \"real world\" outside of books, or that real people can enter the world inside a book, is endlessly appealing. However, my local library is on the verge of opening a new wing with my overdue book fines on this, because I keep hanging onto it in the hope that eventually I will be able to finish reading it. I think it's just not going to happen. First of all, there is something very stilted and anachronistic in the writing, and I can't tell whether that's just <---A>Cornelia Funke</---A>, or a result of the translation work. Also, the book is simply too long. It takes 150 pages for anything to begin to happen,<---M> and that's much too long</---M>, even for an adult book.<---F> I blame J</---F>.K. Rowling for this kind of bloating. Finally, I'm extremely annoyed by people, whether real or fictional, who pat themselves on the back for loving books. People have loved books for as long as there have been books, and even before books, people loved storytelling and drama. You're not a special kind of intellect for loving books and wordplay. The people in <+++>Inkheart</+++> are paraded before us as people with an extra special super duper love of books that is so powerful that they can cause the boundary between books and reality to melt. But just carrying around favorite books in a little trunk and bragging you've loved books since you were a baby and could read before you could talk and so forth isn't particularly magical or distinctive or worthy of praise, and I got tired pretty quickly of <---C>Meggie</---C> and her father and aunt and their extreme reverence for books. Capping it off is Funke's annoying habit of using an epigram from other (<---B>mostly fantasy</---B>) books for each chapter. If she found those inspiring, fine, stick them on your bulletin board while writing. But they were yet more reason to jump out of the story, rather than having it propel along. ...more Oy... I really wanted to like this book. I had such high hopes for it. It was one of those books that whenever my students saw me reading it they said, \"Oh, I really liked that book! It was so good.\" So, I thought it would be great. It just wasn't. The story was nice. In short (very short): Meggie's father repairs books. Her mother disappeared nine years ago. After a mysterious visitor shows up at their house, Meggie finds out that her father has a secret. He can read characters out of books. Ni Oy... I really wanted to like this book.

It just wasn't. The story was nice. In short (very short): Meggie's father repairs books. Her mother disappeared nine years ago. After a mysterious visitor shows up at their house, Meggie finds out that her father has a secret. He can read characters out of books. Nine years ago he was reading aloud and read a terrible villian out of the book and simultaneously read Meggie's mother into the book. The rest of the story is Meggie and her father trying to defeat the villian and maybe get her mother back. Overall... it was a great idea for a book, it just wasn't particularly well excecuted. I can't exactly place my finger on what I didn't like, but it just didn't sit well with me. I think it was the lack of character development. I didn't feel like I really knew the characters. I also felt like I couldnt' quite picture what was happening. I wanted more description-strange for such a long novel. And overall, it was just too long. I felt like it really dragged. I wanted it to move more quickly and have a bit more action. Great premise, but I'm not super excited to read the next one. ...more This book is everything I ever wanted.

Not like me at all. I liked the storyline. I love the fact that it is a book about books, and that is what initially made me want to read it. I read the blurb on the book and it sounded like a really fun read. I was wrong. The book was VERY long-winded.

The best part of the book is the last few chapters, by which point I didn't care - I just wanted the book to end so I could move onto something more enjoyable. I've given it 2 stars because the story is interesting, I just think that it could have been condensed into less pages. Either that or the writing could have had more cliffhangers - therefore making it more unputdownable. Maybe if I could read German, the original book may be more enticing. It's always possible with translations that the book doesn't end up coming across as the author intended it to. I guess I'll never know. I have no desire whatsoever to read the other books. I think this generally works on its own as a standalone novel, but the thought of reading another 500 pages doesn't fill me with joy. ...more What a great story! This is quite the page-turner!

The story is told from multiple viewpoints, which adds another interesting dimension to the story and plot. The book doesn\u2019t contain many light-hearted chapters (as you would find in Harry Potter or Narnia) but the wonderful lead characters are such good people that the book is far from dark. The whole idea of the story is beautiful and intriguing! And the quotes that begin each chapter are perfectly chosen. I kept wondering if there were areas that Funke could have taken out to make the book shorter \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t really find anything that wouldn\u2019t mar the story in some way, and I was grateful there were as many pages to read as there were! A wonderful read and an interesting story that I think has become a new favorite! *** I've read through chapter 16 now, and things have begun to be explained. The book is so very dear, and so very addicting! I now am not at all concerned with finishing it by the movie's release date!:D *** I plan to begin this book today. I've got so many others that I'm in the midst of reading right now, but the fact that I want to finish this before the movie comes out (eek!) I'd best hurry up and start it!! *** Oh dear!! I'd totally blanked and forgotten that this was being made into a movie!! I saw in the paper today that it's being released in mid-March. While this is wonderful, it means that I'd better hurry up and read it!!! ...more The best fantasy novel, I'ver read. I was too much curious while reading that. I just loved it. The way writer moves the story. Specially,3 ratings for character making. Thanks Cornelia Funke. 1. Don't watch the movie. Please, don't watch it, the movie is nothing compared with the books! 2. This series is a must-read for all book-lovers, if you ask me... A father who can awake characters from books just by reading and a daughter with equal abilities. A series about books and reading. A series that offeres exciting adventures, lots of reading, love and friendship, danger, amazing characters and sympathetic villians... What more does a true book-lover need?! Right...Nothing!

This is one of the best series ever. Read it. And if you already did then re-read it once again! :) ...more Enjoyed it well enough. Interesting concept. Good execution. Struck me as a little grim for YA though. By which I mean it's not something I'd read to my boy. (He's fiveish.) I might consider something like this for him when he hits 10 or so. Okay, I'm at hundred pages, and I'm like: someone just kill that loser Capricorn, and then FedEx the rest of the gang home! PLEASE! I'll pay Preferred! It goes like this: go here, go there, go back here, go back there, return to here, and so on... Also, this story was kind of scary, which doesn't rate high in my book (pun intended). The idea was excellent, but poorly executed. Attention: I read this book as a library book and I only just realised that the book I have is only part 1! So this review is going to be of the first half of \"Inkheart\". This was a truly magical story that I know I would've absolutely adored as a child.

I loved this story; especially the first 150 pages where the characters and setting are introduced. That being said, it did take me some effort to get through the last part (of this first part) of the book. As I said, I think I would've loved this book as a child, but reading it now as an adult made me a bit bored at this big escape that the characters are going on. I think I would've been perfectly happy if Meggie and her father Mo could've just stayed at home with their books and each other, because while the beginning of the big adventure was interesting, it did drag on for a bit too long in my opinion. Knowing that the second part of this book will probably just pick up from where part one ended, I'm not sure I'm going to pick it up anytime soon. Now, I know what the story and the characters are like, and I don't feel an urgent need to read the rest of it. BUT I still think that this is a magical story that will take you on quite a fictional adventure, and I'm happy that I got to know Meggie and Mo and their love for books. ...more A wonderful, imaginative story.

Into the deepest regions of their souls we may spy, see all their fears, all their love and all their dreams.\" ...more This is certainly for children and children who like fantasies and adventures and books and who are patient enough to read so many pages that sometimes you'd think you're just going in circles. The story is interesting enough to make me finish the first book but not enough to make me read its sequels. A book about books... what more did I need?

Mo, Meggie's father, can make books come to life, but at the price of something from our world.

Mo, Meggie's father, can make books come to life, but at the price of something from our world. Many years ago, he read the book Inkheart , and characters came to life - Capricorn, the evil villain, his henchmen - including Basta - his mother, and Dustfinger, the strange \"fire-eater.\" The price was Meggie's mother, Teresa. Capricorn is just as ruthless as in the book; Meggie, Mo, aunt Elinor, and a few others must stop Capricorn from unleashing a deadly \"friend...\" \"If you take a book with you on a journey,\" Mo had said ... \"an odd thing happens: the book begins collecting your memories ... you have only to open that book to be back where you first read it ... yes, books are like flypaper. Memories cling better to the printed page than anything else.\" \u2022 The characters are fantastic. They're bookworms, brave, strong, and realistic; relating to them is simple. Romance takes a back seat; it is hinted that Fared and Meggie like each other (Farid at least), but nothing really happens. Which was a nice change. Fear was also a huge part in the book, but everyone faced it bravely and I was most impressed. Fear is not red. Fear is as pale as a dead man's face. \u2022 The writing was extraordinary. All the quotes I have in this review were written down on a piece of paper, to take note and remember, as they were true, honest, and beautiful. Cornelia wrote many pieces about books, and as a bookworm I was delighted. \"You're the one who says books have to heavy because the whole world's inside them.\" \u2022 To conclude, any bookworm will love this book. Fast-paced, many twists & turns, brilliant writing, awesome character, incredible setting and plot... just go read it. Here it was again, the unlucky thing, in its brightly coloured paper jacket. What colour was the binding under it? Raising the dust-jacket with her finger, Meggie saw the dark red cloth, as red as the flames surrounding the ink-black heart. Everything that had happened had begun between the pages of this book, and only the words of its author could save them now. ...more \u0394\u03b9\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd

After I read it, I thought back and couldn't even remember the storyline - it was too jumpy and mumbled. Not a good work of fiction. Inkheart is the best young adult targeted fantasy novel that I have read since the Harry Potter series. Cornelia Funke has crafted a wonderful, if a bit dark, storyline filled with colorful and memorable characters, both hero and villain. I liked the blend of modern day with fantasy in this story and having the magical element of being able to read characters out of their individual stories was brilliant.

Cornelia Funke has crafted a wonderful, if a bit dark, storyline filled with colorful and memorable characters, both hero and villain. I liked the blend of modern day with fantasy in this story and having the magical element of being able to read characters out of their individual stories was brilliant. The storyline itself moves along nicely as Meggie and her father, Mo, go on an adventure both to escape danger and hopefully to find Meggie's mother, who was read into Inkheart mistakenly by Mo in the same instant that he, also accidentally, brought forth some very evil villains. The story itself is very compelling, but what really makes this book are the wonderful and interesting characters that are sprinkled throughout the novel. From the heroes: Meggie and Mo, Dustfinger and great-aunt Elinor, to the evil Capricorn and his henchman, the knife-wielding Bast, along with many, many more, I found the characters to leap off of the page (just not actually into my living room!) Overall, a magical adventure and wonderful addition to the young adult fantasy genre that I would recommend to young and old alike. There are a few fairly scary moments, so I would be a bit cautious with children under 10, but use your own judgement. ...more Ah, what a great ending to a lovely book.

The plot sounded so good, and it seemed perfect anyone who loves to read and who loves books themselves. A book restorer who can pull characters from the pages by reading aloud? I thought it was a sure thing. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed. I've liked Cornelia Funke's books in the past, particularly The Thief Lord , but as I read Inkheart , I noticed over and over again how hollow the story felt, and how much opportunity the author had to make a really amazing book with her great beginning idea. The characters had no depth (despite their emotional reactions to books), and seemed to all be cliches: there's a crazy book-loving aunt, mafiosi, dumb henchmen, etc. I never really bought the sadness and despair that the characters felt from being ripped from their homes within the book, something that Funke really could have developed. Likewise, I never bought that the three book-lovers truly loved books. They didn't reference very many, and even seemed to convey an arrogance about their love of books that I found off-putting. The author also chose to head each chapter with a quote from a book that supposedly prefaced what was to come, but I found her selections poor, and most of the quotes (59 chapters, after all) came from only a handful of books. It felt like, similar to her characters, she only has read a few books. However, maybe I felt this way because the books that the heroine, Meggie, loves are all books I kind of really dislike. Speaking of Meggie, what about her was I supposed to like? She came off as very bratty and negative instead of brave and precocious, which I'm sure the author meant to portray. The mastermind of evil, Capricorn, only wanted to live in a dilapidated Italian village and hoard treasure read out of books while bullying the neighboring towns into silence about his existence. Why exactly was he so scary? What was his evil evil goal? Did he even use the gold to get stuff? Also, it didn't feel like the ability to read things out was consistent. At first, characters can read objects and people out of the book, but they have their own will and don't follow what happened to them within the book. However, the climax involves reading a monster from the book, and then directing its actions with the story written about it. Did I miss something? Was I just skimming at that point? This isn't how the earlier characters operated. And perhaps most disappointing is that nothing really happened with the plot. We find out early on what Mo (a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE choice to name the hero) is hiding from Meggie (the ability to read things out of books), they meet up with Capricorn quickly, they run away, they are recaptured, they plan their escape, the big climax fizzles out. Yet there are 500+ pages to fill. This book made me appreciate Harry Potter a billion times more (and I'm pretty apathetic about HP) because of the level of detail and side story that Rowling is able to incorporate. I believe strongly that good books should feel organic, like they came into being without the aid of a writer. This is a rather large theme within the book, and it was funny to me that Inkheart seemed to be the opposite of it. ...more 4.5 stars Very well written and worth reading! I just loved this book.

Mortimer is a book binder and has passed on his great love of books to his daughter Meggie but he has never read out loud to her. When a stranger appears at their home, Meggie's world becomes upside down. She soon learns about her mothers vanishing disappearance, and the mysterious book called Inkheart, that her father tries to hide at the book filled home of her Aunt Elinor's. She then learns why her Dad has never read aloud to her, because of his secret dangerous gift. Mo possesses a extraordinary magical power. Suddenly the two are plunged into the kind of adventure that Meggie has encountered only in fiction books. They need to find a way to save them selves before it ruins their lives forever. The author does a great job in the characterization of the characters. I finished this book last night and I can still visualize the characters in my head. This book is a trilogy and I can't wait to read the second book as a buddy read with a friend. ...more Tintenherz=Inkheart (Inkworld, #1), Cornelia Funke \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0642\u0644\u0628 \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u06cc -

E, alla fine, ho ceduto e devo ammettere che \u00e8 stata una delle scelte pi\u00f9 ben fatte in vita mia. Mi affido alla mia amata recensione per lista, perch\u00e9 le cose da dire sono talmente tante che ho paura di scordarmene qualcuna in un lungo discorso Mi ricordo ancora di cosa mi ha portato a leggere questo libro: due mie amiche di universit\u00e0 me l'hanno consigliato fino allo sfinimento sapendo che avevo visto solo il film. \"Merita tantissimo\", mi dicevano. \"DEVI LEGGERLO!\", mi ripetevano costantemente. E, alla fine, ho ceduto e devo ammettere che \u00e8 stata una delle scelte pi\u00f9 ben fatte in vita mia. Mi affido alla mia amata recensione per lista, perch\u00e9 le cose da dire sono talmente tante che ho paura di scordarmene qualcuna in un lungo discorso senza interruzioni: - Lo stile di scrittura \u00e8 favoloso. Altamente descrittivo, ricco e, in poche parole, fantastico. Cornelia Funke costruisce un intero mondo come se non facesse nemmeno un briciolo di fatica, come se l'avesse visitato per davvero in un sogno e poi avesse deciso di scriverci una storia su. E' uno stile di scrittura che affascina, che mi ha fatto ritornare bambina e che mi ha emozionato molto. L'unica pecca e pregio (per quanto strano possa sembrare questo doppio giudizio) \u00e8 che \u00e8 molto lento; Da una parte \u00e8 una pecca, perch\u00e9 sembra quasi che il libro non finisca mai, ma dall'altra invece \u00e8 un enorme pregio perch\u00e9 quando si tratta di Cornelia Funke io non sono mai pronta ad abbandonare il suo mondo, i suoi personaggi e le sue storie quindi \u00e8 un aspetto che apprezzo comunque tantissimo. - I personaggi sono tra i migliori di cui io abbia mai letto. Sono quel tipo di persone che vorrei incontrare nella vita di tutti i giorni (ad eccezione degli antagonisti, ovviamente) e con cui passerei delle ore a parlare, parlare e parlare. Mi rivedo molto, in particolare, in Mo e Meggie, i quali hanno una grandissima passione per i libri e per la lettura. -- Il mio preferito, per\u00f2, resta Dita di Polvere. La Funke, creando Dita di Polvere, ha creato un vero e proprio capolavoro. Non esiste un personaggio meglio caratterizzato di lui: \u00e8 affascinante, impavido, sconsiderato, scaltro, esilarante e porta con s\u00e8 quel pizzico di magia che lo rende ancora pi\u00f9 interessante ed eclettico. - Con le sue descrizioni la Funke apre una finestra sul mondo che sta creando e mi sembrava quasi di essere fagocitata dalle pagine e di assistere alla storia in prima linea. Con le sue parole l'autrice mi ha fatto sentire il sole sulla pelle, la ghiaia dura sotto i piedi nudi, il calore del fuoco sulle dita di Dita di Polvere e la magia che, come un mantello, copre interamente la storia. Questo \u00e8 un libro che si legge con tutti e cinque i sensi all'erta, un libro che ti coinvolge mentalmente, fisicamente ed emozionalmente. - La trama \u00e8 originalissima e non esiste nient'altro del genere al mondo. In questo libro non ho trovato quei clich\u00e9 che si ripetono costantemente in ormai quasi tutti i romanzi che leggo. Ogni cosa era per me una sorpresa e i colpi di scena non sono mai mancati! - Ho adorato l'importanza che viene data ad ogni singolo personaggio, come se ognuno di loro avesse uno scopo all'interno della storia. Nessuno \u00e8 stato trascurato e ognuno ha avuto il suo spazio nel corso del libro, com'\u00e8 giusto che sia. - Mi \u00e8 piaciuto moltissimo il rapporto tra Mo e Meggie, padre e figlia, e dalle parole della Funke traspariva proprio l'amore e il bene che provano l'uno per l'altra. -- Ho apprezzato molto anche il rapporto di amicizia che si va ad instaurare con gli altri personaggi e la naturalezza con cui si trovano ad affrontare insieme, con immenso coraggio, delle situazioni che li mettono in pericolo di morte. - L'azione non \u00e8 mai mancata e l'autrice \u00e8 riuscita a coinvolgermi perfettamente nel romanzo, tanto che mi sono ritrovata a provare quello che provavano i nostri personaggi. Mi \u00e8 quasi sembrato, inoltre, di essere parte della storia io stessa. Insomma, come avrete potuto capire, ho adorato questo libro in maniera spropositata. E' uno dei libri che preferisco al mondo e lo porter\u00f2 sempre nel cuore.

[...] Dar exist\u0103 un personaj care le \u201edomin\u0103\u201d pe toate, un personaj de care m-am \u00eendr\u0103gostit (da, da, \u00eemi e ru\u015fine, etc.), \u00een ciuda numeroaselor sale defecte (poate ele sunt r\u0103spunz\u0103toare pentru acest crush nea\u015fteptat?). El este Deget-de-praf. Dac\u0103 Mo, poreclit Limb\u0103-vrajit\u0103, poate controla \u015fi manipula cuvintele, Deget-de-praf este \u00eemp\u0103ratul focului \u015fi st\u0103p\u00e2nul fl\u0103c\u0103rilor. C\u00e2nd el chema v\u0103p\u0103ile, c\u00e2nd le oferea contur \u015fi putere, m\u0103 trezeam cu nasul lipit de pagini, de parc\u0103 a\u015fa a\u015f fi avut o \u015fans\u0103 s\u0103 m\u0103 strecor \u00een povestea lui, s\u0103 \u00eel z\u0103resc, vr\u0103jit\u0103, cum devine una cu focul, spre deliciul \u015fi spaima celor care au avut norocul de a-l privi. Din p\u0103cate, nu po\u0163i s\u0103 ai \u00eencredere \u00een el. Este un la\u015f (\u201ecalitate\u201d pe care nu o ascunde), un mincinos \u015fi un uneltitor, dar \u015fi un personaj trist \u015fi r\u0103t\u0103cit, care \u015fi-a pierdut familia \u015fi c\u0103minul, fiind \u201er\u0103pit\u201d de c\u0103tre glasul lui Mo din povestea sa, cartea \u00een jurul c\u0103reia se \u00eenv\u00e2rte ac\u021biunea trilogiei: Inim\u0103 de cerneal\u0103. \u201eAprinse apoi o a doua f\u0103clie \u015fi-\u015fi plimb\u0103 flac\u0103ra pe bra\u0163ele goale. Ar\u0103ta fericit ca un copil care se joac\u0103 cu juc\u0103ria lui preferat\u0103. Focul \u00eei lingea pielea ca ceva viu, ca o fiin\u0163\u0103 \u0219erpuitor-arz\u0103toare cu care se \u00eemprietenise, care \u00eel dezmierda \u015fi dansa pentru el \u015fi alunga noaptea. Azv\u00e2rli \u00een v\u0103zduh f\u0103clia, acolo unde tocmai str\u0103lucise incandescent mingea de foc, o prinse din nou, aprinse altele, jongla cu trei, cu patru, cu cinci f\u0103clii. Focul lor se \u00eenv\u00e2rtejea \u00een jurul lui, dansa cu ele f\u0103r\u0103 s\u0103-l mu\u015fte. Deget-de-praf, \u00cembl\u00e2nzitorul-de-fl\u0103c\u0103ri, Scuip\u0103torul-de-sc\u00e2ntei, Prietenul focului.\u201d ...more I really liked the concept of this book. How many times have I dreamed of being a wizard at hogwarts, or dancing at a ball with Mr. Darcy, or dare I say it, being a Cullen? (just kidding). I did think the writing was a little dis-jointed at times, but maybe that comes from the translation. I also thought that she was extrememly long-winded. So much of the book seemed rather irrelevant to me. It could have been half the length and been just as good. I also thought some of her characters reactions I really liked the concept of this book.

So much of the book seemed rather irrelevant to me. It could have been half the length and been just as good. I also thought some of her characters reactions to things were a little unbelievable. Like when Basta finds Pippo and is hauling him around and holding knives to his throat and all the little kid does is cry. Let's talk about tramautic events, and then you hear nothing more about it. It just seemed to me that sometimes she wanted her characters to seem real, with families and loved ones, and then other times they became strictly fictional, reacting to situations like no normal person would react, or like she just forgot about them and wanted to move on with the story. I also though Meggie seemed at lot older than 12. She's definatly more mature than most 12-year-olds I know. One last note, I thought it funny that she kept saying throughout the whole book how people who read books never think about the authors, or if they do they figure all authors are old and dead. All in all, a good book. I could definatly relate to their love of books, and when I get older and my kids are gone, I would love to live in a house just like Elinor's, stacked from top to bottom with more books than I could read in a lifetime. I did however think that their reverance for all books was a bit extreme, because what good is a book if you're not going to read it, but just lock it in a glass case. I never really understood the desire to be a \"book collector.\" I'd like to have tons and tons of books, but I don't really mind what condition their in, as long as I can read them :) I also enjoyed how she put qoutes from other books at the beginning of each of the chapters. Gave me a lot more books to look up and read. ...more Hoo boy did I love this novel. Firstly, it's a book about books and the people who love them. You really can't go wrong starting from there. For a young adult novel, it has several interesting quirks. Maybe it's because I'm used to reading about American and British heroes and heroines in my YA novels, and this book is translated from the German, but it was a nice change to have a different setting ... from what I could tell, this book takes place mostly in Italy. And it avoids many of the conven Hoo boy did I love this novel. Firstly, it's a book about books and the people who love them. You really can't go wrong starting from there.

And it avoids many of the conventions of most YA novels (young person is an orphan or has at least one dead parent, any living parent has no idea what's going on with young person, and certainly that parent has no concept of whatever magical things are occurring). Although Meggie, the 12-year-old protagonist, lives with her father, and her mother is \"gone,\" her father is a huge part of the story. He's not a vague presence who has to be gotten around ... he's integral to the plot. Without giving anything away, Mo, the father, is the reason the whole story happens. And this book is SCARY. The bad guys are really bad. There are guns and knives involved, and people die. I was tense most of the time I was reading, and sometimes reluctant to keep reading ... it took me an entire week to finish, which is a LONG time for me. I don't know that kids younger than their mid-teens should be reading this book. If you're looking for a change from the Harry Potter mold, this is the book for you. I'm looking forward to the second installment ... Inkspell. ...more Excellent book (haven't seen the movie). A youth book, I looked forward to getting the sequels and grabbed them as soon as they were available. Dropping back to add this. I'm surprised how different tastes can be. I really liked this book (and its sequels)and was very surprised to see the negative reviews. I didn't find the book ever dragged and while I did find the characters annoying at times, it was within the context of the story and not as \"annoyingly written characters\".

For a youth book I'd be very careful as some of the \"villains\" here are genuinely frightening and could be a bit much for younger children, but were my children still young I'd read these to them. I developed a love for books early on and this book plays to that...I mentioned elsewhere that I loved Lilith by George MacDonald, I believe that it was the library scene in that book that first sold me or drew me into that book. This is a book full of book lovers for book lovers. Most any reader knows that a book can be a door to another world, here Funke took the idea and \"built on it\" with a certain amount of...literalness. Recommended. ...more 3 stelle e mezzo Avevo aspettative altissime per questo libro, tutti lo acclamano, tutti lo amano, tutti lo portano nel cuore.

Beh\u2026 ecco che mi tocca, di nuovo, il ruolo di pecora nera che va controcorrente! Anche se non mi \u00e8 affatto dispiaciuto, tutto sommato. Questo libro \u00e8 molto bello. L\u2019idea di un libro in un libro \u00e8 geniale! \u00c8 un racconto pieno di magia e avventura, un racconto che ogni ragazzino che si approccia alla lettura e al Fantasy dovrebbe leggere. Ammetto che la Funke ha tratteggiato i suoi personaggi alla perfezione, ho adorato Mo e l\u2019acida Elinor e ovviamente ho fatto il tifo, fino alla fine, per Dita di Polvere. Il fatto di avere in un libro del genere un personaggio che oscilla sempre tra azioni giuste e azioni sbagliate, in un mix di rimpianto, rabbia, senso di colpa e affetto, ha dato l\u2019impronta giusta alla storia! Per contro, non ho apprezzato fino alla fine Maggie, che oscilla sempre tra capricci di bambina (qual \u00e8) e un coraggio da leone, Capricorno mi \u00e8 sembrato una barzelletta messa l\u00ec, tanto per avere il cattivone di turno, infatti, durante la lettura risaltano di pi\u00f9 i suoi scagnozzi che Capricorno stesso e, sinceramente, anche Farid mi \u00e8 risultato alquanto sciapo (ma molto probabilmente, adesso, \u00e8 il mio lato pignolo a parlare). Quindi, tutto sommato, la storia, tra alti e bassi, non \u00e8 male. Secondo me il grandissimo difetto di questo libro \u00e8 la narrazione, il modo di scrivere dell\u2019autrice, che \u00e8 molto descrittivo (ma questo per me non \u00e8 affatto un difetto, anzi!), risulta per\u00f2 troppo lento. Lento, lento, lentissimo! Tanto che ho dovuto fare diverse piccole pause prima di rimettermi a leggere, cosa che nel momento dedicato alla lettura io non faccio mai! A pagina 100 ancora la situazione non si era evoluta minimamente, i personaggi stavano l\u00ec tutti quasi immobili, mentre i capitoli scorrevano. Poi finalmente qualcosa cambia,la storia ingrana, ma la lentezza, e quindi, la pesantezza, \u00e8 rimasta fino alla fine. Leggere questo libro, almeno per me, \u00e8 stata un\u2019opera di concentrazione assurda! Mi stancavo con una facilit\u00e0 infinita. Pur amando molto le descrizioni e uno stile narrativo corposo, mi sono resa conto che questo libro avrebbe reso di pi\u00f9, se i capitoli fossero stati resi pi\u00f9 leggeri! Insomma sono arrivata alla fine solo perch\u00e9 non ho l\u2019et\u00e0 di Maggie da un bel po\u2019. Fossi stata una 12enne, ma anche una 14enne, conoscendomi avrei mollato il libro al 3\u00b0capitolo! (Si, quando ero pi\u00f9 giovane e spensierata non mi facevo problemi a mollare una lettura su due piedi, confesso\u2026) In tutta sincerit\u00e0, non so se continuer\u00f2 la serie. ...more I can't say that I've ever read a book like this one before, and the idea of a power that allows people to bring fictional characters to life is something that I think most authors wish they possessed. I really liked this book, at first I wasn't expecting much from it but it turned out to be phenomenal.", "Title": "Inkheart"},
