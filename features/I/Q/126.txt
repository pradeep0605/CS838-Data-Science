Friends of mine, you know I adore you, so please don't take offense at this review. If you enjoyed this book then I\u2019m really glad you did. It makes me happy when people enjoy literature. So you probably shouldn't read this review if you love this book. It's nice to know that even though Cassandra Clare's Draco Trilogy ended years ago, I can pick up ANY SINGLE ONE of her books that she has published and see not only Draco\u2019s character, but all my old friends from the Harry Potter Fanon Universe with different names and physical descriptions but otherwise pretty much intact. Because seven really long books just wasn\u2019t enough for them apparently. It's nice to know that the snappy little one-liners and cheap hijinks are being recycled because they worked so well the first AND second time she used them. I don't think I've made it any great secret that I despise the writings of Cassandra Clare - so let me get the, few, good points out of the way so I can go back to imagining a world where authors like this are forcibly chained to their desks and made to read their own stories over and over again until they\u2019re sorry. -She stopped using so many damn similes. I no longer feel like gouging out my own eyes every single time she tries to describe something. -There is no creepy incest in this book so my husband was spared walking in on me trying to choke the life out of a paperback novel.<---F> And\u2026 that about it</---F>. I mean, let\u2019s face it, if the only good things I can say about this book are that she\u2019s made slight improvements so that I no longer feel the urge to commit seppuku by diving head first into a meat grinder, then it\u2019s not high praise. So what was wrong with this novel? Well, other than the fact that the characters were almost CARBON COPIES of ones that I\u2019d read in City of Bones, Draco Dormiens, Draco Sinister and Draco Veritas, there was just so much to hate. The character building that they actually DO have only exists because she did the work years ago (<---B>on top of another author's pre-existing characters</---B>) \u2013 otherwise they\u2019d be little more animated than the clockwork automatons that appear in this story. Don\u2019t get me started on how she wiki\u2019d \u201cVictorian Society\u201d, copy and pasted the information into word and then randomly injected it into the story via the characters parroting the cans and can\u2019ts of the time period. Not even going there. It\u2019ll take too long to complain about that. How about her inability to write a storyline that is in anyway surprising? Reading one of her novels is like watching a dumbed down version of Scooby Doo. I actually liked Scooby Doo (before Scrappy-Doo came along. Whoever made that character needed to be shot, hung, kheelhauled and quartered \u2013 the whole works) but you know how they\u2019d go somewhere and they\u2019d be like, \u201cHey guys, I think something\u2019s going to happen! Hey, look gang, a perfectly inconspicuous diving mask\u2026 I WONDER IF THIS COULD BE A CLUE *WINK**WINK**NUDGE**NUDGE* FOR ALL THE FIVE YEAR OLD KIDS PLAYING AT HOME!\u201d In <+++>Clockwork Angel</+++>, Clare practically flags you down, makes you come look VERY hard at her clue that is painted bright, bright red and poorly hidden behind her back while she insists that it\u2019s not actually there and giggles every time she tries to make you not look at her ENORMOUS FLIPPIN' CLUE. She insists on this behaviour until finally you pat her on the head, tell her that she ALMOST managed to colour inside all the lines. The whole concept of this book wasn\u2019t original! It was her looking at the Internet culture going, \u201cHuh\u2026 so people are really getting into steampunk, eh? Hmmmm\u2026 how can I cash in on this with as little effort on my behalf as possible?\u201d She is recycling characters that she built on from the Harry Potter universe years ago. She's recycling storylines, conversations, personalities, plot-points, ideas and concepts from all around her and she recycles her own stuff (what little there is of it) just as frequently. When she was accused of plagiarism for lifting entire paragraphs of text from other authors without referencing it, she made a comment that it didn't really matter because - hey, isn't fanfiction just pastiche anyway? Well, fine. It was just fanfiction, who really cares? But I'd think after all these years she would have moved on past her pastiche style of writing to something that she could actually claim as her own. But you know what? She can't. I feel no guilt in saying that she doesn\u2019t deserve to be published or to be earning the money that she is. I will proudly complain about her books until she actually starts to care about the fudge that she\u2019s packing. ...more THIS WAS SO GREAT. I'm so glad that I finally picked it up! I'm going to be doing video review/discussion for this so be on the look out for that soon on youtube.com/jessethereader :) When people ask me ''Who is your favorite author?'' I never know exactly what answer to offer. I very much enjoy reading L.J. Smith \u2019s books. But C.S. Pacat is my favorite M/M author! And let\u2019s not forget how amazing J.K. Rowling \u2019s Harry Potter series is. Oh, and have you heard of Kiera Cass ? She wrote such a swoon-worthy love story! And Eliza Crewe , Leigh Bardugo , Laini Taylor and Marissa Meyer are all new favorite authors of mine. Nonsense. No need to be torned ever again. Cassandra Clare ...is, When people ask me ''Who is your favorite author?'' I never know exactly what answer to offer. I very much enjoy reading L.J. Smith \u2019s books. But C.S.

And Eliza Crewe , Leigh Bardugo , Laini Taylor and Marissa Meyer are all new favorite authors of mine. Nonsense. No need to be torned ever again. Cassandra Clare ...is, to me, an incredible and worth knowing author. She seems to be possessing such an overflowing with imagination and ideas and originality mind. And she simply knows how to create endearing and filled with chemistry relationships, romantic or not. Plus, you know how sometimes you read scenes in a book and you feel like they aren\u2019t clear or so poorly contextualized that the author\u2019s words are sadly hard to follow? Well that never happens with this author. And, hell! she switched from urban fantasy to historical fiction + fantasy + steampunk with perfection! It's crazy, so to speak, how interesting I find her characters to read about. They\u2019re not just fantastically created and developped beings. They\u2019re always more than that and, often, they will reach out to the deepest parts inside you...and make you realize some things you never have before and open your eyes on others. I don\u2019t know how she does it. What I do know though is that she has a great talent and that is something I very strongly believe and will not let someone convince me on thinking otherwhise. It's how it should always go, anyway. You appreciate, admire, love or even crave something? Don't let anyone destroy that feeling. Because it is true and powerful. I fervently and judiciously thought about it and...I did not quite prefer this impressive series to The Mortal Instruments one. You see, I simply think that they\u2019re both very different stories. This one, for instance, contains a variety of new original characters and elements that we do not see featured in the other series\u2026and that\u2019s great. I mean, I LOVED this book. But, I still am deeply smitten with Alec & Magnus as a couple and this beautiful couple in question is (unfortunately yet understandably) not present in <+++>Clockwork Angel</+++> . Magnus Bane is in fact my all-time favorite book character (which one is yours?) Certainly, this book gave me some background story on him and made me learn new things about his character, but he still is more present in The Mortal Instruments nonetheless which is something that I cannot forget. ( Very awe moment from this book : Remember when Magnus says ''Black hair and blue eyes are my favorite combination.'' That...drives you right to Alec Lightwood. It earnestly made me sigh with love and contentment.) Oh Jem, Jem, Jem...isn't he a lovely, swoon-worthy character? All beautiful art works were taken here . ...more ____________________________________________ \u201cOne must always be careful of books,\" said Tessa, \"and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us.\u201d ____________________________________________ \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u26065 FULLY STARS!\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!

While I liked Mortal Instruments, I wasn't as rabid a fan as I know many people are, so I read Clockwork Angel out of curiosity more than anything else...and I'm so glad I did! This book is spectacular, with everything I'd wanted in the TMI series and more. The magic and mysteries are compelling and Victorian London is a fantastic backdrop to this steampunk tale about a girl who discovers she has incredible powers...and an incredible past. Tessa is a vibrant, fascinating heroine and all the secondary characters, including Will and Jem and Charlotte, are engaging and sympathetic. I thought this book was much more mature than the TMI series, so I'm very much looking forward to reading the next two Infernal Devices installments. I *loved* the clockwork army and the clever way Tessa learns to use her powers to overcome her enemies. Jem is really great, but I LOVE Will. I have theories about his deep, dark secret...and I think he's being cruel to Tessa for a very good reason.

I hat This book got 1.5 stars from me simply because I was also reading Tiger's Quest by Colleen Houck, and comparing with Tiger's Quest, Clockwork Angel looks like it deserves 1.5 stars... In order to save you some precious time, I will tell you my honest reaction to Clockwork Angel right here, right now: Thank you, Shou . Also, when I first opened the book, I was faced by this description as well: Magic is dangerous-but love is more dangerous still. *sighs* What kind of soap-operatic shit is that!? I hate this line instantly. I don't think Clockwork Angel is the most horrible book which I have ever read--it isn't, the action scenes and part of the plots are enjoyable to an extent. But oh boy, Clare's writing and her characters annoy me, the book as a whole annoys the freaking hell out of me, here're the reasons: (1) The recycling of characters: The main characters in The Infernal Devices series are the photocopy versions of the main characters in The Mortal Instruments series, plain and simple. \u00a0Tessa is Clary, Will is Jace, Jem is Simon and Jessamine is a bitchier version of Isabelle. Only that in TID series those recycled characters got different colors of eyes and hair, they were dressed in 19th century British outfits and they were living in a supposed Victorian era. First we got the main girl, who is called <---C>Theresa Gray</---C>--- Theresa Gray --- Clarissa Fray ---Do you see the similarity here? Why can't Ms. Clare come up with some other slightly more original names for her 'heroines'? Tessa's similarity with Clary doesn't just end here. Clary was looking for \u00a0her mother, who was kidnapped by the villain, and Clary soon realized her mother had hidden a secret from her. On the other hand, Tessa was also looking for her brother in London, said brother was also kidnapped by the villain, later Tessa also found out her brother had hidden a secret from her. Not only this, Tessa's attitude is just as annoying as Clary's. Clary's bitchy remark about how \"fat, ugly people don't get to become vampires because ugly people probably don't want to live long\" bugs the hell out of me when I read City of Bones. In Clockwork Angel, I found Tessa making a very similar remark on Brother Enoch's strange, frightening appearance: \"It hardly seems worth living a long time if you're going to look like that .\" Wow, Tessa was badmouthing Brother Enoch behind his back when Brother Enoch was trying to save Tessa's own brother Nate's life. How ungrateful. Of course Tessa thought if you weren't beautiful, then living a long life, devoting yourself to gain knowledge and help people still don't worth it. The most important thing for her is to be beautiful, I got the message perfectly! Simply put, not only Tessa is an recycled version of Clary, she is also as judgmental, ungrateful and rude as Clary is. AND THAT'S OUR MAIN CHARACTER. And of course, the same like Clary, Tessa had to possess a special ability which no one else but her can wield. One big fat sign for Mary Sue, right? Then we meet William Herondale, who's supposed to be a great warrior but who's also extremely handsome, cocky and filled with smartass remarks up his sleeves, who is rude to everyone else for no good reason. He's a copy of Jace Lightwood/Wayland/Herondale/Morgenstern/whatever. That's it. The gentle, 'good boy' Jem is Simon in disguise, Jem is being designed to be the weaker part of the love triangle, I like him just as I like Simon, but I have nothing more to say about him. As to the beautiful girl Jessamine, she's a slightly more interesting, but 100% more bitchy version of Isabelle Lightwood. I will get back to her later. (2) Troubling behaviors/attitude from main characters: When we first meet Will and Jem, they were both tracing a demon. Then they found out a young girl was slayed by the demon, but they hardly gave any reaction to her death. Isn't it just bad for Ms. Clare to spend more time to describe what Will and Jem look like, what clothes they wore then she spends time on describing how her two male leads reacted to the death of this innocent girl? And I had talked about Tessa's bitchy attitude toward bad looking/strange looking people before. I also noticed that whenever Tessa met someone, the first and foremost thing she would notice about them is their appearance and she always judged them on how they looked. Here's one of the most outrageous example: Tessa was trapped in the den of the evil doers(Dark Sisters), and a stranger had just broken into her prison cell. AND ALL SHE HAD NOTICED IS THAT THE STRANGER HAS \"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FACE SHE HAD EVER SEEN, EVEN THE LINE OF HIS THROAT IS PERFECT\" !??? WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER!? Also, \u00a0Tessa was secretly jealous of the pretty women/girls (e.g. Jessamine, Lady Belcourt, etc), and looks down at ugly, strange looking people. That kind of attitude is just hateful. Jem had once commented that he thought Tessa was pretty, but I don't think there's enough amount of prettiness, which would be enough to cover up Tessa's mean-spirited, judgmental, ugly little heart. There's also one things about Clare's supposedly Victorian characters that bugs me a lot. It's that for the life in me, I can't believe the ladies and gentlemen in the high society would be talking so rudely and directly to one another. I mean, even the rudest characters in Jane Austen's novels wouldn't talk in the same way like Clare's characters. Remember Jessamine? I had said that she is a bitch, she's unbelievably rude to everyone when we first meet her, especially to Tessa and Henry. But oh god, shouldn't a lady be taught not to directly make rude remarks? And why would no one ever called her out for being unladylike? Guess what's the worst part? The worst part is that when Jessamine was openly insulting a guest (Tessa), NO ONE--not Will, not Charlotte, not Henry, even bothered to stop her. Where's these people manner !? Oh, now I can see that all these Shadowhunters are a bunch of wimps, they can't even stop a rude girl from insulting their own guest, and we're supposed to believe they are the fierce protectors who stood between humans and demons? The same with Jessamine, whenever Will was saying rude things---even to a point he directly told Charlotte her husband was a useless piece of trash, still Charlotte, who was the head of the Institute, did nothing to shut him up. CAN THIS BE SERIOUS!? (3) Failed attempt at making the characters strong, brave and likable After reading 5 Mortal Instruments books and Clockwork Angel, I began to realize Ms. Clare seems to be unable to write likable characters (with the rare exclusions of Simon, Jem, Magnus and maybe Alec). When she tries to write brave, strong girls but they always turn out rude, judging, self-righteous and unlikable. When she tries to write complicated male leads with a haunting past, she only manages to make them into cocky, rude dickheads. Just like with Clary, Ms. Clare tried to paint Tessa as the tough girl, here's one of her attempts: Tessa shouted. \"I won't let you give me to the Magister! I'd rather die!\" Well, then what about your brother Nate? Remember that supposedly the Dark Sisters still have him, Tessa? That \"I'd rather die\" part, makes me almost want to laugh. Hadn't the Dark Sisters made it quite clear that the Magister wants to use Tessa instead of killing her?\" Not only this, after Tessa was taken under the Shadowhunters' wings, she began to doubt their motivation for helping her. I fully understand Tessa would be suspicious of the Shadowhunters' intention. After all the girl had just been kidnapped. But it bothers the hell out of me when Tessa never bothered to say one single, simple \"Thank you\" to those who had saved her. Is saying \"Thank you\" so difficult?\" Then Tessa complained in her mind how she hated having to be grateful when Charlotte borrowed her a dress to wear. That little bitch! You know what, it isn't like Charlotte was obliged to be nice to her at the first place! And then Tessa and Will went undercover and sneaked into a vampire party, but when the two of them were surrounded by a roomful a vampires, Tessa just had to lose all control and screamed her head off when she first caught sight of her brother Nate being held captive by the vampires. I, for the life in me, can't think of any worst action to draw attention and endanger Tessa herself, Will and even Nate. Can she possibly do any worse to draw attention upon herself and Will by screaming and being impulsive and ACTING LIKE A FIVE YEARS OLD KID IN GENERAL!? Will on the other hand, is as horrible a person as Tessa. The more I read the book the more I realize they deserve each other. For example, when Will discovered Tessa was in Jem's room at night, he came up with the following remark: \"Do you normally turn up in gentlemen's bedrooms in the middle of the night? If I'd known that, I would have campaigned harder to make sure Charlotte let you stay.\" (p.108) Screw you! Will, you asshole! I understand it isn't proper for Tessa to show up in Jem's room in the middle of the night, but what're you hinting at with your damn remark? Are you hinting that Tessa is a whore or she's a loosed woman!? Not only this, in the middle of the story, Will thought about Thomas, the servant boy who once was his best friend BEFORE JEM CAME ALONG AND WILL TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THOMAS! Will totally forgot about the servant boy who was once his friend right after he found a new friend. He was still in good term with Thomas only because the latter happened to have the big enough heart to forgive him. Don't tell me Will isn't a horrible person. Just don't. (4) Failure in research: Since Clare had decided that her character Jem as a half British, half Chinese who had spent his childhood in Shanghai, there're a few reference on Chinese culture. And I, just happen to be a Chinese; which means I found Clare's twisting the little details of Chinese myth around a little bit difficult for me to stomach. First, when Tessa first encountered Jem, he told her that Westerners like her and Will would be referred to as 'Yang quizi' in Chinese, which meant 'Foreign Devils'. Oh yes, Westerners were, and sometime still are, being referred to as 'ghosts' in Chinese because in Chinese myth, only dead people/ghosts have pale white skin and yellow/red hair! It's ghost, not Devil! There's hardly any concept of Devil in Chinese traditional culture! GET YOUR CHINESE WORDS AND THE TRANSLATION STRAIGHT WHEN YOU WRITE THEM! And the reference of 'Westerners=ghosts' fact is not some rarely known, difficult to access information, it's quite widely known that Westerners were/are being referred to as 'ghosts' by the Chinese. There're even a few English novels mentioning this fact, I recall one is called \"White Ghost Girls\" ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76... ), the ghost girls in here mean young, underage Western girls. Then the next thing I know, Jem revealed that that his parents were murdered by a demon called Yanluo. OMG!!!! Yanluo is the name of the king of underworld in Chinese myth, not a freaking demon! There're many demons, ghosts and fox spirits etc in the Chinese myth, but King Yanluo isn't a freaking demon, he's an underworld deity, you hear me!? (5.)The annoying love triangle Don't even get me started with the love triangle! I know that it's a LAW for YA girls to have feelings for the total jerks instead of the good boys who at least can have a normal conversation with her without insulting her in every way possible! (6.) The ending The ending of Clockwork Angel, what a mess! People have been swearing up and down that the ending part of Clockwork Angel is where things finally getting good. But all I can see is the Shadowhunters falling into the bad guy's trap foolishly and conveniently so Will can rush in for the rescue at the last minute. What a poorly designed plot twist! Everyone: Will, Jem, Charlotte, Henry, all of these supposedly seasoned Shadowhunters, turned out to be complete FOOLS, who are ill informed, who can also be easily tricked and manipulated. \u00a0It looks like Clare had dumb-ed them all down in order to create tension and threat. My goodness, these people are supposed to be warriors who protect humans from the evil demon race, but judging from the way how those Shadowhunters ran business, I wouldn't even trust them to guide me to cross the freaking street! The ending...to be frank is almost a photocopy of City of Bones. People are arguing whether Ms. Clare is able to write something original for her series instead of copying her old creation. And my answer to this question is: No, she can't. *major plot spoiler warning* (view spoiler) [ First, is there anyone really feeling surprised that Nate turned out to be a traitor? Secondly, is anyone out there really feeling surprised that de Quincey isn't the Magister? Also, I would have respected Tessa more if she really carried out her plan to sacrifice herself so she wouldn't be used by the Magister! But no, Tessa tricked her way out instead of carrying out her plan for real , and I can't believe for a second the Magister would be fooled by her stunt! I don't believe it the same like I can't believe that You-Know-Who wouldn't personally check Harry Potter is dead for real with his own eyes and hands! As to the Magister himself, he is so underwhelming as the arch villain. Plus, why it's never explained that what kind of importance did Tessa's clockwork angel hold? (hide spoiler) ] *end of plot spoiler* At the end Will became even more obnoxious than Jace to a point that I was furious when I read what he had said at the end to insult Tessa. For crying out loud, Jace never suggested Clary to become his whore. Goodness, having a painful past isn't an excuse to treat everyone like crap! Look at Jem, the boy had been tortured and forced to witness the horrible death of his own parents, but unlike Will, \u00a0Jem was still able to choose to be a decent human being instead of what he had experienced! Now, I want to make two prediction before I read the sequels: *plot spoiler warning* (a) I dare say Will was cursed that if he cared for/loved someone else, then his loved ones would be put in harms way ever since he was a kid. I'm confident that my guessing wouldn't miss the mark by far. And Clare had wanted this to be the explanation of why Will was treating everyone like crap. (b) I dare say the Magister's great evil plan is to have Tessa Changing into Queen Victoria or a member of the Royal Family so he could take over British, it's just pretty obvious. *end of plot spoiler* The Final Words: If you can tolerate annoying, sometime hateful characters, people acting like fools for most of the time and poorly delivered plot twists and 'surprises', then you might go ahead and read this book.

The characters were one hundred times more better than that of The Mortal Instruments! Everybody was so much more likable and mature. I really thought for a second that Tessa Gray was older than sixteen years old because she carried herself more maturely than Clary. I always thought Clary was selfish and bratty, but Tessa is the complete opposite. And Will. Oh my William Herondale. I thought Jace was swoonworthy. PLEASE. Jace doesn't even come close to how Will swiftly steals the heart of all the ladies! And maybe even a few boys. (; He's that damaged bad boy Shadowhunter that we just can't stay away from. Sorry Jem, but I think I'm 100 PERCENT TEAM WESSA! <3 I never knew there would be a love triangle in this book. So if you're like me, I'm extremely wary of love triangles. I DESPISE love triangles. It's old and overdone. And my couple never ends up together that's why I get all salty and bitter over them. :'( But I honestly didn't mind the love triangle between Tessa, Will, and Jem. I don't want to start assuming, but I think it's pretty evident who she'll end up with in the end. But whoever she ends up choosing, I won't complain about at all. Both guys are just so lovable in their own way. <3 I absolutely fell in love with Clockwork Angel and I do believe that it's even better than The Mortal Instruments so far (I just finished City of Glass). Cassandra Clare's writing has improved immensely since City of Bones! And thank goodness, Cassandra decided to cut down the length of the chapters because I can never find a good place to stop while in the middle of one since some of her chapters can even go up to 50-70 pages or something that feels like it. xD I can't wait to devour and binge read The Infernal Devices because Cassandra Clare got me completely hooked! I'm looking forward to seeing how these events will ripple and affect the events that occur in The Mortal Instruments. ...more To be honest, I\u2019m not quite sure how to rate this book. It wasn\u2019t all bad, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was good either. It was rather boring at times and the story dragged heavily, especially in the middle and towards the end. None of the characters has become particularly dear to me. I didn\u2019t buy the love story. However, I think I would have liked it much better if I hadn\u2019t read the Mortal Instruments series before. But the books are so similar (which was to be expected, I know, as they are set in th To be honest, I\u2019m not quite sure how to rate this book.

None of the characters has become particularly dear to me. I didn\u2019t buy the love story. However, I think I would have liked it much better if I hadn\u2019t read the Mortal Instruments series before. But the books are so similar (which was to be expected, I know, as they are set in the same world) that I couldn\u2019t help compare them to each other, and Clockwork Angel pales in comparison. The character constellation is almost the same: We have the girl who has never heard of the Shadow World before, but plays a bigger role in it than she believes. We have the boy with the dark past who refuses to let anyone come close to him. We have his best friend, seemingly the only one he cares about, who hides a secret of his own. We have the slightly bitchy girl who acts like she doesn\u2019t care about anything at all but who can fight extremely well if she has to. But Tessa doesn\u2019t have Clary\u2019s wit and strength, and her obsession with what is proper and right might be realistic for the girl of the 19th century, but it annoyed me a lot. Will doesn\u2019t hold Jace\u2019s attraction, and whereas his lines sometimes caused me to smile a little, they never made me laugh out loud. Jem is nice, but almost too nice sometimes. It seems like besides his mysterious disease, he doesn\u2019t have any faults. Still, he is my favourite character of those four. Jessamine has it in her, but I didn\u2019t particularly like her and she didn\u2019t show any signs of love for her fellow Shadowhunters as Isabelle did despite her attitude. The love story revolving around Tessa and Will didn\u2019t really capture me. Will might be snarky and mysterious, but he can also be very mean without a real reason. I\u2019m sure the motives behind his attitude are going to be revealed in future books, though. All in all, I didn\u2019t find him particularly appealing. The plot itself is fortunately different from the Mortal instruments series, but rather slow at times. Despite the 400 something pages this book has, not much happens. And what does happen is also somehow boring because, if possible, Tessa is mostly kept out of the fighting scenes or doesn't participate much in them. Deaths occur, but I didn\u2019t really feel shocked or sad about them. All things considered, the only people I really liked were a) Jem, b) Magnus Bane, who is from the TMI series and unfortunately only made a very short appearance and c) the cat (I know that is not a person, but I\u2019m a huge cat fan) they found towards the end and decided to keep. I didn\u2019t really have that high expectations for this book, but was a little disappointed nevertheless. I wish Cassandra Clare would have had the guts to write something completely new instead of hanging onto the success of her first three books. In the end, the only thing this book did for me was make me look forward to meeting the characters from TMI again, and I really hope that wasn\u2019t the author\u2019s intention. 2 stars after all, because I can\u2019t really say I liked it and struggled quite a bit to finish it. Not sure yet if I will be curious enough to read the sequel, but probably not. ...more Oh you guessed it I read this to up my book count!

This just made me more excited for Clockwork Prince to come out. Goodness I am not patient these days! Merged review: Seriously blown away doesn't even cover it. I have to admit I had my doubts and reservations about how this book was going to turn out. We have the ever present love triangle, a girl that doesn't know her powers, and some other similar plot lines. I was thinking \"Oh no not a rehash of The Mortal Instruments!\" My worries were stupid really. I should have trusted Clare's remarkable way of telling a story. To be sure I won't make the same mistake twice and never doubt again. Tessa is an American girl coming from New York to London in search of her brother. Things apparently go wrong from the onset. Her brother, Nathaniel, isn't there and she is taken by the Dark sisters. She learns fairly quickly that there is a whole new world she didn't know about. Where terms like Downworlders, Nephilim and Shadowhunters are commonly used. Her path will cross with that of the Shadowhunters and with them she will figure what happened to her brother, but like always there is something lurking behind the scenes. Something that will change the foundation of both the mundane and magical world. When I first read the City of Bones I had thought the author could have set this in the past, and wondered why she didn't try that. Obviously she was just holding out on us! The cast of characters like always are utterly compelling and you get attached to them almost right away. I want to refrain from making too many comparisons with this series to TMI, but I'd like to point out that I admired Tessa more readily than Clary. They both are strong female characters but I just clicked with Tessa better. The action certainly did not disappoint, and is one of the reasons why I just can't get enough of these books. I'm so ready for more guts to spill. There is of course the question of love interests: the unpredictable Will and the caring Jem. Both equally gripping characters and at the moment I'm just Team Tessa cause I want things to work out well for her. The wait will be most agonizing for Clockwork Prince . Actually the word agonizing doesn't quite show the gravity how much I want to read the next book right now. ...more What a load of bloody melodrama. This book ought to be sung in operatic fashion by a cast of three in a slightly seedy theatre in Brooklyn. It's the sort of book that's dreadfully self-important but really, when you think about it, nothing happens: a few people appear, some technology gets destroyed, two things kiss and stuff, and between all that is a metric ton of filler. Listen, I'm not going to lie and say I didn't kind of enjoy it. This was my third attempt at reading this, and I guess thir What a load of bloody melodrama.

It's the sort of book that's dreadfully self-important but really, when you think about it, nothing happens: a few people appear, some technology gets destroyed, two things kiss and stuff, and between all that is a metric ton of filler. Listen, I'm not going to lie and say I didn't kind of enjoy it. This was my third attempt at reading this, and I guess third time's a charm. I got through it in two and a half days, and two of those days were spent mostly at work and doing other things. It's not something you need to funnel a lot of time into and it's not something that requires a great deal of thought. All of the deep talk about humanity and love and family and quoting from books I never intend to read is just a smokescreen to disguise that this book is thin, its characters are thin, its mythology is particularly thin, and even some obvious fanservice in the form of Magnus Bane couldn't spice it up. It's not a bad book; it's not a good book, either. The problem with Cassandra Clare is that she creates great side characters and shite main characters. Tessa and Will are straight-up shite. They're bad people and absolutely tone deaf to what's going on around them, even when it's endangering the lives of the people they \"care about\". Those air quotes are for real. Neither of them are particularly interested anything other than each other's smell. They're like dogs at the park; the leaves and the trees and the brisk wind is cool and everything but when there's another dog in a ten-foot radius, oh-ho. Forget comfortable lead walking. Actually, just say goodbye to that dog. Nothing else matters. I love Jem, but that's the problem, isn't it? He's a side character and yet he's so much more more worthy of being a protagonist than Tessa. I want to follow Jem. I want to know Jem. But instead we're trailing along on Tessa's skirts, watching her waffle from room to room of this unnecessarily massive Institute, ruin plans, beg for Will's attention, and generally oscillate around the library while everyone else does the work. I don't expect Tessa to be Xena, because she's not been trained in combat, but if she isn't trained, don't take her on a mission into a vampire nest. Jesus Christ, how have these Shadowhunters survived so long if they're so dense? There's something almost creepy about this fad of asshole love interests; I know it started long ago, with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, experiencing a Renaissance with Bedward, and soaring to unprecedented heights in anything written by Cassandra Clare. I mean it - anything. There's probably an asshole love interest on her shopping list. There's probably one written into the alphabet magnets on her fridge. Will is a nasty piece of shit, and he's rewarded for that by having so many people around him who love him. Someone like Will, who victim-blames, who taunts women, who throws Tessa's confidence and her affection back in her face, doesn't deserve to be surrounded by people who are constantly forgiving him. I know Clare well enough to be certain that there's some sort of \"I push people away to protect them\" backstory buried under all of this, but that's not enough. Will is simply a nasty bastard with a piss-poor attitude. I think my biggest problem with this book is that it's just sort of limp. The setting felt sort of half-hearted, a kind of par-boiled vision of stereotyped London. At one point Jem says to Tessa, \"You're thinking, If they call this damp nastiness summer, what must winter be like? You'd be surprised. Winter's actually much the same.\" I live on the east coast of Scotland. This summer I got sunburnt three times and lay out in a tank top in the park, sunbathing with the dogs. I am much farther north than London, which is in the south of England, and experiences a warm temperate summer and mild springs and autumns. The rainiest months in the UK are the winter months, and April and July. Every few years the dryness in southern England causes a hosepipe ban. So fine, set your book outside of America. That's cool. I'm sick of books about New York. But for god's sake, ask. Read a few blogs. Ask the people who live there what's it's like. \"It rains in Britain\". Yeah, it rains in the desert too. Your setting is a sad shoehorn for mean boys and bland girls. This whole Shadowhunter thread just rubs me up the wrong way. I don't like Shadowhunter culture, politics, or mythology. I don't like the way the Shadowhunters mock the Silent Brothers, who are also Shadowhunters but apparently undeserving of respect because they're ugly; I don't like the way the Shadowhunters profess to protect humans but treat them like animals and slap them with a label as demeaning as \"mundanes\"; I don't like the way they use Downworlders, but how this is excused by the narrative, which tells us that the relationship is edgy between the Clave and Downworlders, but it's fine because the Shadowhunters only hunt the Downworlders whom the narrative dubs \"evil\" and stroke the ego of those it proclaims \"good\". No grey area there, then! As long as we only kill the \"bad guys\" and have sex with the \"good guys\" (in secret), then it's not about power and control and it's not a privileged few creating a dichotomy out of those they deem less worthy than them. Right? RIGHT? I'm assuming that this is to swiftly avoid the Shadowhunters being labelled problematic, but it's not the way they use Downworlders that makes them so fucked up. It's the small things, like Jessamine being demonized for not wanting to hunt monsters, the othering of the Silent Brothers, the amount of money that is poured into maintaining the absolutely massive Institutes that house about five Shadowhunters each. The Shadowhunters wonder why demons and warlocks and vampires hate them, and maybe it's not because they hunt them, but because they're so corrupt. Even things we're supposed to think of as charitable, like Sophie and Thomas and Agatha being employed at the Institute, is fucked up. The Shadowhunters employing those people is as good as signing their death warrants. How can they possibly justify swanning around and calling humans \"mundanes\", then inviting them into their home to work for them, then leaving them to die in the name of an exclusive creed that they're not allowed membership of. How dare the Shadowhunters drag human Sophie, Agatha and Thomas into their war? And of course, after the clockwork (fucking steampunk. Ugh) creatures attack the Institute, all of our precious Shadowhunters are alive without a scratch, and only the humans who they looked down upon died. The Shadowhunters have no connection to the outside world - they exist inside a glass case of superiority, supposedly protecting humans that they attack with slurs and have no interactions with. Even in the Mortal Instruments, it was said that Jace, Alec and Isabelle had only met a handful of people their own age, and they never ever mixed with humans. What sort of protectors are they, if the thing they're protecting is looked at with such disgust? Why are the Shadowhunters even doing this job? For their own satisfaction? It's got nothing to do with protecting the world. It's about bloodlust, because they don't care a whit about the everyday \"mundane\" on the street, unless it's to laugh about their deaths or have sex with them. God, fuck the Shadowhunters. What dicks. ...more I now understand the Will Herondale hype. Cassie Clare. We meet again.

I apparently have gained a following because of these reviews , and they have convinced me to use my analytical powers on The Infernal Devices series. You could say I'm easily swayed because I lack dignity. But this is really just too much fun. It's so much fun, I need to be stroking a cat. First, the usual disclaimer. This review contains spoilers, griping, whining, over thinking, and general ranting. Trolls need not apply. Let's get started. Ladies and gents. Gather 'round. I'm about to tear into Cassandra Clare's 19th century version of The Mortal Instruments . I present to you: The Mary Sue, Tessa Gray! (Rhymes with Clary Fray.) Tessa is a magical orphan girl from across the sea. She can shape shift you see, which isn't really a stretch for a character with almost no personality. Sure, Tessa is a really watered down version of Clary. She's just self-absorbed and judgmental enough to allow me to draw the comparison, but otherwise I could insert just about anyone in her position. She doesn't think she's pretty. Check. She likes books. Check. All the boys fall in wuve with her. Check. She's supposed to be smart, but really isn't. Check. How hard was it for Clare to round out this girl. I mean, it's only the fourth book she's written . Tessa couldn't be a Georgia peach who's family lost everything during the Civil War when she was just a babe? She couldn't be a textiles factory worker who used to prop her book up on the loom while she worked? (This was actually pretty common at the time.) She couldn't be the daughter of an insightful inventor who used to dream of flying? Come on! If you're going for Steampunk, Clare, go for it! Tessa should have been a goggle clad shape shifting, grease monkey. Her and Henry could have gotten their nerd on. But no. Her writer lacks the creativity to make anything remotely cool and fun. Speaking of shape shifting. Tessa's special shape shifting ability allows her to change into anyone she wants as long as she has an object they owned. She gains their memories and thoughts, and if they died, she sees how and feels it. If the person is a Down-worlder, she gains their abilities and attributes. At one point, she turns into Camille - a vampire - at one point, and her heart stops beating. Sounds pretty cool and useful, right? Well, here is the thing with Clare's books if you aren't already familiar. If it makes sense, she doesn't use it. Nope. To easy and not romantic enough. Tessa's ability would be really useful in combat, but instead it's a deus ex machina . Clare only has Tessa use her shape shifting to move the story forward. The rest of the time it sits on the side. Oh, now the fun part. Do you remember the whole Boadicea thing? How Tessa thought she couldn't be a fighter because she was a woman, but she could fight back because it's in her heart? I know, right! I'm laughing to keep from crying. Will tells Tessa there was this badass warrior chick who gave the Romans hell named Boadicea. (Usually spelled Boudica. I know about her because I saw a documentary on her. She was badass. And so were her daughters.) So, Tessa tries to emulate Boadicea by \"killing\" herself so the baddie can't have her. She fakes it using her shape shifting because apparently, when someone dies nice and bloody, she gets covered in it. Whatever. There was lots of blood, but the bad guy didn't check for a wound. The baddie invents robots and he falls for a trick from a girl who was stupid enough to scream in a room full of vampires. Yes, this girl, who trusted her philandering older brother. Oy vey. Next up, William \"the Scoundrel\" Herondale! Will, as everyone calls him, is really just Jackass Jace with the dial cranked to 11. He's the kind of guy who will be dead in a ditch at 19. You know, reckless, rude, and utterly inappropriate. It's supposed to be the Victorian era, and he's making open sexual advances toward Tessa. These are the kind of advances that even a modern woman would have kneed him in the balls over. He doesn't wear a hat or waistcoat or cravat, so he's basically running around half naked. He treats everyone like crap. Do I really need to go on? Oh, and all the fan girls get hot and horny over him. He's an insensitive, self centered asshole and girls think that's hot. Let me guess, that means he's damaged and only needs love to make him a better person. If that wasn't one of the most popular myths these books portray. Feh. He needs thumped, plain and simple. I can't believe Tessa is even thinking about hooking up with the guy. Now for James/Jian/Jem Carstairs. This half-Chinese sweetie is just a gentleman. I'm seriously shocked that Clare can even write a character like him. He's so nice. He even saves a cat. Literally. When Tessa is feeling down, he just talks to her. He's the kind of boy you bring home to your mom. And then there's the venom addiction. Yeah, Clare totally ruined Jem. She couldn't have him be some nice kid. It's like that Simon/Vampire thing all over again. In a nutshell, Jem was tortured by a demon and his parents were forced to watch. By the time he was saved, his body was addicted to the venom. If they try to wean him off it, the withdrawal is bad enough to kill him. So he has to continue to take it or he dies. Flip side, the stuff is killing him. It also keeps his hair and eyes silver. Even then, he's still a way better person than Will. Hands down. There isn't even a contest. But there is something that Clare uses Jem for that I don't like; to make excuses for Will. Jem is Will's battle buddy. They're buds and watch each other's back. Jem tries to explain Will's appalling behavior to Tessa, saying that there is more to him than she thinks. The problem with this is that it ends up being hot air to make Will look deeper than he is. When Will enters a scene, all this \"oh, but he's damaged\" talk flies out the window on a fart. Jem was tortured and he's dying, and he's an absolute doll. Will has no excuses. Now it's time for the parasol twirlin' Jassamine Lovelace. She's the biggest waste of a strong female character. She had the potential to go from opinionated Lady full of spunk, to Tessa's awesome-sauce gal pal. But that isn't how Clare works. Once she thought that Jess would turn out to be \"better\" than Tessa, she turned her into someone so selfish she would leave a comrade behind. I was shocked because it didn't fit with the characterization that Clare had set up for her. There's this dollhouse scene where Jess shows Tessa her dollhouse replica of the house she grew up in. She even had dolls of her mother, father, little brother, and her. She tells Tessa that her house burned down with them in it, and it's the only thing left of them and her old life. She tells Tessa that sometimes she imagines that they wake up, go about their day, and then go to bed all safe. Nothing bad ever happens to them. No Shadow-hunter business and no fire. They're perfectly normal. I imagined this very sad teenage girl running her fingers over everything in that house as she tried to explain why she didn't want to be a Shadow-hunter. Why she didn't want a life of fear that you or the ones you love won't come back. Why she didn't want to deal with death and blood. But here is why I hate Clare's writing. She turned Jessamine into such a bitch that her desire to be married and a mother without being a \"warrior\" is unacceptable in her world. I mean, Jess is part angel. Why should she want anything else? Why would she want to be mundane ? They're worse than Down-worlders. Clare writes her Nephilim like they're perfect, but I can't blame Jess for wanting out. It would be a horrible life to live. There's more characters: Charlotte, who is 23 and not a very good leader; Henry, who can't get any of his inventions to work right; Sophie, the poor maid who can't catch a break; Agatha, the cook; Thomas, Will's cast-aside childhood pal; but they aren't really worth speaking about. And the villain, I'll get to him when I get into world-building. Which I'm starting, now. There is nothing like trying to make sense of Cassandra Clare's world. There are so many gaping holes, that I've mostly given up. Mostly. First, I'm going to start with the gun thing. Yes. Shadow-hunters don't use guns because supposedly the runes they tried to scratch into the weapon and bullets keeps it from firing, and no one knows why. I would believe it if she wasn't the queen of convenient. From what I know, not all the weapons are inscribed with runes. I mean, she'll describe the curve of Will's neck, but not every weapon. We know some of them are made of electrum. Why not electrum bullets? Now, I'd understand if they didn't like using them because guns are loud and they would be afraid to hit an innocent bystander. When they strive for secrecy, there's no glamour in the world that would cover up an accidental bullet wound to the head. But wouldn't they want to keep a couple around. Maybe a Colt Peacemaker and a lever action Springfield. I mean, those would come in pretty handy when they bad guy is a mundane . And he's packing his own heat. Oh, and what about the automatons? Those wanna-be Steampunk cyborgs. I would have at least tried a shotgun loaded with a slug on one. From some of the appendages those things were given, why would anyone want to get close? But Clare has to have all her Shadow-hunters carry weapons on the archaic side of the scale. And she doesn't even describe them right. She says Will has straps crossing his chest. That is called a bandolier. Clare will describe the parts of a dress (and not even accurately), but she doesn't get into the finer points of melee weapons even though all her characters are warriors. Look at Jem's cane-sword-thing. She describes it like a blade shoots out of the end, but cane swords were really popular in the 19th century, so that seems more likely. He could use the cane part to block and then attack with the blade. Damn it. I started thinking with logic again. Give me a moment. Then there is her version of Victorian London. First, let's start with the fact that the fog was so thick and toxic that you could chew it and it killed hundreds. New York was no picnic at at time, but Tessa probably would have choked on it. Clare describes it like it's some coal dust and mist. Second, the characters act like it's the 21st century and not the 19th. They were way too informal and ran around without hats all the time. In fact, most of what Clare puts about \"her\" London is like she was writing a book report. It doesn't flow well at all. She lacks in the social politics of the time. Tessa is American in 19th century Britain, and a Down-worlder no less. She would constantly be regarded as a sub-human by British Shadow-hunters. They acknowledge she's a Down-worlder, but not the fact that she's a barbaric American. And I'm not even going to get started on Will kissing Tessa and implying that she should give him her virtue because she probably can't have kids since she's a warlock. (I mean, seriously. How do girls think that's hot?) Then there's Clare's writing. It never fails in giving me entertainment. She's laid off the similes a bit, but not enough to matter. There are still zingers, but this time I wrote down all the ones I cared to involving glass. Yes, glass. I swear she has a fetish for it. \"... eyes like glass.\" (p.37) \"... a noise like cracking glass.\" (p. 39) \"... a gaze as sharp as glass.\" (p. 72) \"... like snow sticking to a dark glass pane of a window.\" (p. 172) \"... as if through a pane of glass.\" (p. 212) \"... it sounded like shattering glass.\" (p. 248) \"Will's eyes were slivers of blue glass.\" (p. 304) \"... like thin stems of glass against her skin.\" (p. 359) Remember, those are the ones I wrote down. There are a lot more. Clare's similes really are the one of the true weaknesses in her writing. Even when she uses a strong active verb, she tacks on a simile at the end like no one will understand what she's talking about. But that's when she uses a strong active verb that she hasn't abused. Everything still \"gleams, \"glints,\" \"glimmers,\" \"shines,\" and \"shimmers\" when it isn't \"blue,\" \"silver,\" \"white,\" \"black,\" \"pale,\" \"icy,\" or \"gold.\" All these weaknesses are apparent in Clare's obsession with appearance. In scenes where emotional description should take precedence, Tessa physically looks at people instead of trying to understand the conversation on an emotional level. Take these lines from when she's talking with Jem on Blackfriar Bridge: \"Tessa let herself stare at him, marveling a little at his strange beauty in the moonlight. He was all silver and ashes, not like Will's strong colors of blue and black and gold.\" (p.315) Jem is trying to have an intimate moment with her, and all Tessa can think about is his coloring in the moonlight versus Will's. Not about how much of nice person he is because he was willing to share his favorite place with her. Yeah, I really wanted to smack Tessa. Clare's heroines are so superficial I don't know how these girls could be considered strong female characters. Whenever she gets remotely close to writing a female character that is worth something (Izzy, Jess), she ruins them. She pushes their heroic actions to the background or covers it up with abhorrent and stereotypical behavior so that her intended \"strong\" female character can remain the Mary Sue. She doesn't treat her characters like people. She manipulates them to fit her needs first. Well, my word count is almost up. I can't go into a tireless rant about how this book is unintentionally ironic most of the time with all these profound things Jem or another character floating in the background says that Clare can't apply or covers up. But what I can do is leave you with my favorite one. This is from when the Shadow-hunters surrounded the vampire Axel DeQuincy and the rest of his ilk that survived. I now give you his tirade in response to the Shadow-hunters bringing up the Accords: \" Equal? You don't know what the word means. You cannot let go of your own conviction, let go of your belief in your inherent superiority, for long enough to even consider what it would mean. (p. 254) So true, and he was a bad guy.

It was so tedious i had to fight the urge to fall asleep. Most of the stuff was not even relevant and important! There was so much small, annoying talk and description that was not needed at all, and i couldn't help buy skip some of the words/paragraphs. Too much is never good. The middle 'This is finally getting better!' Bigger half of the book (300-400 pg) The ending My Tessa. I didn't really like Tessa. She was ok. What was most irritating about her was that she couldn't protect herself. She was always counting on someone else to do that, but i must give her the credit for trying. I guess i also found her too...girly? And i know it's the 18th century and most women were like that, but it was kinda annoying. She was all like \"Women don't fight. They don't have it in them. They can't wear anything except dresses, especially not the fighting gears. That is just wrong\". Will: Will is all like... He is so full of himself it's actually nerve racking for me! And don't even get me started on what a total jerk he is! I hate the way he pretends not to care about anything, especially the way he treats Tessa. He is so mean i want to slap him in the face! BUT.. there are sometimes glimpses of a guy that actually has a heart. And i think that's the reason why i like him. I also kinda love his sarcasm. WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGER JERK? WILL OR JACE? TELL ME DOWN BELOW! Jem: I really like Jem. He is so nice, understanding and caring. Couldn't say the same thing for Will! (view spoiler) [I feel so sorry that he is dying. But they will find a cure, right? If they won't, my heart will break. (hide spoiler) ] I find Jem really interesting, and i would love to learn more about him! I loved that clockwork angel necklace that Tessa wears, it's so intriguing and fascinating! (view spoiler) [And you know when the angel suddenly came to life to protect her? That.Was.Epic. (hide spoiler) ] I was really annoyed with Tessa's and Will's relationship. They only had one kiss, and afterwards Will just pushed her away and acted all weird. Why can't they have a normal, romantic scene for once in a lifetime?! Overall Clockwork Angel was not as good as book 1 in TMI series. But i will definitely continue with the trilogy, i still have lot's of questions and i really want to find out how Jem's 'condition' will be solved.

My very first book by the incredibly popular writer, Cassandra Clare , and she didn't disappoint me at all. I've always wanted to give her books a try and see what the hypes are about but was taken aback by such a HUGE chronicle. I mean, there are other series more or less related to The Infernal Devices or The Mortal Instruments and I have the habit of readathoning all of them. Fortunately \"It was books that made me feel that perhaps I wasn't completely alone.\"--Will Herondale So, this is it. My very first book by the incredibly popular writer, Cassandra Clare , and she didn't disappoint me at all. I've always wanted to give her books a try and see what the hypes are about but was taken aback by such a HUGE chronicle. I mean, there are other series more or less related to The Infernal Devices or The Mortal Instruments and I have the habit of readathoning all of them. Fortunately, I don't think it's a problem now because wow, the story is far more interesting than I expect. For starters, the beginning is really, really captivating because we'll meet the notoriously handsome Mr. Herondale very soon, like, only a few chapters later Tessa started her journey to the entire Shadowhunters' world with much uncertainty in the first chapter, which excited me a lot. She headed for London on a steamboat (the transportation in this book intrigued me because they brought me back to the 19th century perfectly, as if I was born and lived there) and was greeted by the Dark Sisters . Honestly, I was super fascinated by her ability--shape-shifting--and she was far from ordinary. What makes her different from any other paranormal characters is that she described her transformation when practicing her newly-discovered skill, including her emotional and physical change thoroughly and heartfelt. Moreover, the magic those Nephilims wielded was pure awesomeness. Instead of the control of basic elements as we usually see, using magic spells and drawing ancient symbols were comparatively more enthralling. Although I've been told the romance in Cassandra's books isn't all sunshine and rainbows, there's no denying I still hold on to a thin thread of hope that perhaps, just perhaps, Tessa and Will would develop something slightly more than friends. Well, it's not impossible, right? They were probably the cutest OTP ever and both of them were total bookworms, like us. In my opinion, the best kind of romantic development is the slower, the better. And occasional bickerings is just a cherry on top! \u201cDo you normally turn up in gentlemen\u2019s bedrooms in the middle of the night? If I\u2019d known that, I would have campaigned harder to make sure Charlotte let you stay.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see how what I do is your concern,\u201d Tessa replied. \u201cEspecially since you abandoned me in the corridor and left me to find my own way back to my room.\u201d \u201cAnd you found your way to Jem\u2019s room instead?\u201d However, as much as I expected Will to make the first move toward her, he disappointed me eventually. I know that he had some unspeakable issues in private so that's why he lied and cruelly told the truth regardless of her feelings, but maybe he could be less straightforward. It's called \"etiquette\", dude. Thus, I honestly didn't like him as much as I thought I would. And it saddened me that how desperately Tessa needed the affection that she knew wouldn't get from him. No. She could not have imagined that. Will cared for her, she was sure of it. Yes, he had been rude to her almost since he had met her, but then, that happened in novels all the time. Look how rude Darcy had been to Elizabeth Bennet before he\u2019d proposed, and really, quite rude during as well. And Heathcliff was never anything but rude to Cathy. Though she had to admit that in A Tale of Two Cities, both Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay had been very kind to Lucie Manette. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire\u2026 . On the other hand, Jem began to grow on me because I didn't feel anything for him at first, but the way he talked and acted warmed my heart. He was such a nice guy compared to Will, but nobody's perfect, he suffered from a sort of disease like drug addicts. **Ugh, why does Cassandra try to complicate every character here and make almost everything look impossible?** Well, I wasn't seeing the development of \"Jamessa\" coming, but by the end of the story, they seemed more likely to be together. I mean, when a guy genuinely says something so conforting and heartwarming to a girl, how can she resist him? \u201cPerhaps you are here because you are otherwise alone, but so am I. So is Will. So is Jessamine. And even, to an extent, Charlotte and Henry. Where else could Henry have his laboratory? Where else would Charlotte be allowed to put her brilliant mind to work the way she can here? And though Jessamine pretends to hate everything, and Will would never admit to needing anything, they have both made homes for themselves here. In a way, we are not here just because we have nowhere else; we need nowhere else, because we have the Institute, and those who are in it are our family.\u201d Whether she'll really be with either Jem or Will remains unknown in the end of this book and I'm not sure which one she truly loves. The former always opens up to her and tells her the truth in a better way than just spills it, while the latter seems to conceal his feelings and secrets in front of others and pushes all those who deem him as family away, but deep down, I believe there's a soft spot under the hard exterior. They both turned toward the door; as they went out, Jem looked at Tessa and gave her a little shrug. I wish you were a Shadowhunter, she thought his eyes were saying, but maybe it was simply what she hoped they were saying. Perhaps he was merely smiling at her kindly and there was no meaning in it. I still can't get enough of Jem's wise words and god knows where his cleverness came from. He's a perfect role model of a best friend forever, a considerate boyfriend, a loyal partner, a faithful warrior, and a formidable Shadowhunter. Whenever he spoke, his words never failed being profound and meaningful. They stated the facts but at the same time, pointed out the bright sides of them. \u201cI know the truth about Nate, now, and painful as it is, it is better than being lied to. It is better than going on loving someone who cannot love me back. Better than wasting all that feeling.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cI think he did,\u201d said Jem, \u201cand does love you, in his way, but you cannot concern yourself with that. It is as great a thing to love as it is to be loved. Love is not something that can be wasted.\u201d Next, the reason I didn't give it a 5-star partly because the middle of the story slacks a bit for me, and I couldn't feel the connection among those characters the same way I did as the beginning AND the end , and partly because I really, really, really didn't get it why Tessa cared for her brother, Nate, so much . He was obviously addicted to gambling and lost a tremendous amount of money and even (view spoiler) [sold her out to the Magister in exchange for silvers (hide spoiler) ] and then lied to all of them the whole time. However, she still defended him until some severe destruction was caused and then good people died, bad ones fled. Frankly speaking, she had to embrace the truth, no matter how ugly it was, and moved forward. Lastly, despite the minor flaw I disliked, I still recommend this book/trilogy to all of you because there are lots of twists and turns that'll leave you wanting more. Btw, there are also many quotes from the characters that're so suitable for all the book lovers like you. \"One must always be careful of books,\" said Tessa, \"and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us.\" [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I originally read this....not sure when?

To be utterly honest with you, I missed the world Cassandra Clare created and once I started this book, it felt like returning home . It's a unique and warm feeling that for me, personally, is rare to find while reading. Only certain authors have managed to cause me feel this way and Cassandra Clare is certainly on the list.

He held up the object. \"Watch.\" Will moved to object, but it was too late; Henry had already pressed the button. There was a blinding flare of light and a whooshing sound, and the room was plunged into blackness. Tessa gave a yelp of surprise, and Jem laughed softly. \"Am I blind?\" Will's voice floated out of the darkness, tinged with annoyance. \"I'm not going to be at all pleased if you've blinded me, Henry.\" I also very much liked the people that worked at the Institute. Thomas, Sophie and Agatha were all very nice people. Oh and there is Jessamine who I reckon is shadowhunter, I kept not really thinking about her as she was a butt head a lot of the time. Anyway, so this evil dude wants Tessa for her abilities so they all get in this big war over Tessa. This evil dude also have these crazy clockwork people, which made me think of that Dr. Who episode.

Wow. Be forewarned: this book is no literary great. There is no literary aspiration here, no groundbreaking prose, no food for thought. Put very plain and simple, this is the best kind of guilty pleasure book there is. In Clockwork Angel ther Having read Cassandra Clare\u2019s Mortal Instruments series beforehand and having only found them to be entertaining but certainly not amazing, I began Clockwork Angel with fairly modest expectations, anticipating at the most, unique characters and humor abound. Wow. Be forewarned: this book is no literary great. There is no literary aspiration here, no groundbreaking prose, no food for thought. Put very plain and simple, this is the best kind of guilty pleasure book there is. In Clockwork Angel there is evoked a sense of old-world glamour that was Victorian London, a place of creeping fog that obscures lamplight and horse-drawn carriages that clatter through the cobblestone streets in heavy silence punctuated by the heaving rhythm of the Thames. This was my perception of London that Clare evoked with her writing, and I thank her for it because it made my enjoyment of her world that much better. Like aforementioned I began the reading of this novel expecting rich characters with distinct personalities, and I was surely not disappointed. Tessa Gray is the newcomer to the world of Shadowhunters, and her character does not disappoint in that she is in almost every sense the proper lady of the 1800s: polite, courteous, respectful, and modest. So it is with great pleasure that I watched her transform into a stronger and braver person, one who was not afraid to defend her loved ones with her all and verbally spar with others in humor or defense of her beliefs. In the following books I hope to see her grow even more as a character, and perhaps even fight with a weapon? *am hopeful* Will Herondale is the resident bad boy with the probable heart of gold. He\u2019s handsome, tormented, sarcastic, and cold, yet occasionally we glimpse a softer and more passionate side to him. Okay, so the boy is hilarious. And endearing. And then there is Jem Carstairs, who is walking, talking, living proof of a terrible cruelty, and yet despite this he is kind, and caring, and understanding. His wit rivals that of Will\u2019s in hilarity, which makes for frequent scenes of comedic gold. Which is part of the reason why I loved Clockwork Angel so much. I truly look forward to these three\u2019s future interactions in the next two books. To compliment the main characters is a wonderful cast of supporting characters who are every bit as developed as Tessa, Will, and Jem. In all honesty, the only difference between them all is the length of their appearances, the lack of which will no doubt be remedied in future books. One thing I\u2019ve realized that I absolutely LOVE about Cassandra Clare\u2019s work is that her stories never center solely on just one female lead and one male lead. The universe does not revolve around the girl and the guy, with maybe one or two other periphery characters thrown in for comic relief or antagonism. No, rather, there is always a rich cast of characters that supplement each other; they give each other depth and personality; there is a warm sense of camaraderie and rivalry that permeates the atmosphere and makes me care for them. Clare can write some truly amazing characters, authentic and engaging and unique, ones in which I readily invest myself and my feelings. Their interactions, the love and hate and laughter and pain and joy and anger that passes between them, is part of what made Clockwork Angel so special. The story itself is a marvel as well, brimming with enough delicious twists and turns and cliffhanger (singular, not plural. One is enough, whooboy) to rival Daedalus's Labyrinth. The plot is alternately thrilling and chilling, hilarious and somber, lighthearted and tragic. The combination is one made just right, a winding adventure through the London of Queen Victoria\u2019s time. Although the queen doesn\u2019t actually make an appearance in the novel. Clockwork Angel is amazing in its ability to present a story that is BOTH character-driven and plot-driven, with both done superbly well. It affected me in a way that the Mortal Instruments series did not, that I adored practically every single character and was captivated by the story until the very end. I eagerly eagerly await Clockwork Prince on tenterhooks, and will even look forward to City of Fallen Angels with more excitement based on the strength of Clare's writing in this novel. ...more Enjoyed this one and found it very intriguing! I will be continuing this series.

You know the feeling when you are so much invested in a series that you are willing to over look all the things you didn't want to happen. Imagine Dumbledore you know what. When the character idiocies addle you,your ships sink,the author suffers from George R.R Martin syndrome and starts killing people like fleas. YOU.JUST.DON'T.CARE. Because you just..... Don't. Well this is TID so this gets even worse because, THE INFERNAL DEVICES ARE WITHOUT PITY. THE INFERNAL DEVICES ARE WITHOUT REGRET. \u270f Basically I'm writing this because I was in the mid of Clockwork Princess and accidentally I read the prologue because I am a literary misogynist was sleep deprived.Not. Well to quote Cassanra Clare herself: Curiosity is my besetting sin. But now how am I going to live a normal life anymore?The emotional trauma that has been bestowed upon me by The Infernal Devices may possibly haunt me for the rest of my life.Ohh and I also got a papercut. Call it fate a cliche. Hurt me in all the possible ways you can. I'll probably pick up Clockwork Princess again maybe in a hundred thousand years. My OTP--->Wessa! \u270fLets be honest that is all I want to talk about.And William Herondale, Of course. Tess Tess Tessa!!You flibbertigibbet,polyandrous shrew,blushing eyelash fluttering Mary Sue with TVD Elena antics \"Ahh I love Stefan but I kinda love his brother too\". WTF. Yeah, She's got that kind of thing going on. Will you choose someone with euphonious skills over someone who reads for real and is willing to discuss books?and Hello he BELONGS TO THE MALE SPECIES! (view spoiler) [(no, ikr?) (hide spoiler) ] So basically Tessa is out of her mind or possibly high. Oh and nice,kind,decent unruffled Jem. You're..... Boring. Jessa shippers please don't kill me Okay? \u270f WILLIAM HERONDALE! *Boom Clap* \u2018You will never know, sweet William How many are the million ways in which I love you.\u2019 Tatiana \"Herondale\"(Can't blame her, You know you wanna) \u270f In all his perfect imperfection \u270f he personified perfection \u270f beauty incarnate \u270f bitter humor,dry humor,dirty humor, every kind of humor suits you. \u270f You're nonsense makes a lot of sense \u270f Your illogical fashion advice.... \u270f and when you read a book for Tessa and said I'll get you more books. I was on the verge of a heart attack. AND NOTE: Living in a society where polygamy is legal, I don't think love triangles or squares are cool or even romantic. The Infernal Devices does heavily imply that an X can be in love(as in really) with multiple people at the same time but this is something I just can't digest. So, I'll probably won't be reading the last half of Clockwork Princess for ever.Hahaha [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more *3.5 stars* Dare I say, this wasn't horrible? It wasn't AMAZING nor did it in any way blow me away -because let's face it more than a few of the events that happened were literally the same things that happened in the mortal instruments.- but it wasn't HORRIBLE. *cough cough* TMI. If you've been following my reviews for awhile, you probably know that I absolutely hate The Mortal Instruments. My strong disliking was to the point where when I heard Cassandra Clare would be writing more than one *3.5 stars* Dare I say, this wasn't horrible? It wasn't AMAZING nor did it in any way blow me away -because let's face it more than a few of the events that happened were literally the same things that happened in the mortal instruments.- but it wasn't HORRIBLE. *cough cough* TMI. If you've been following my reviews for awhile, you probably know that I absolutely hate The Mortal Instruments. My strong disliking was to the point where when I heard Cassandra Clare would be writing more than one spinoff series, I thought \"Seriously? Does she not know how to write anything else?\" While originally having no interest in reading The Infernal Devices, I began to notice that a lot of people who didn't like The Mortal Instruments, LOVED The Infernal Devices. Around that time the cover for Lady Midnight was revealed. I was immediately mesmerized by how beautiful the cover was and was intrigued so I decided to pick up The Infernal Devices to read before the release of Lady Midnight. I must admit I'm a little glad I decided to pick this up. While I wasn't overly impressed by the story, I do think it has potential. SO much potential. One thing I really liked was the obvious fact that the writing was way better than it was in The Mortal Instruments. Not only that, but the characters were SOOO much more tolerable/ swoon worthy *cough cough* JEM!! Anyways, also the world building, it was great getting to know about the England institute at that time period. I usually don't like reading book set around the 1800's or earlier but I enjoyed reading this fairly well. Now back to JEM! JEM JEM JEM *Drools* *faints* *throws self at Jem* *Faints again* Yes, I am obviously team Jessa and Yes, I am mourning because I know this will end with my heart broken. *Sobs* Also I didn't really like Will??? Like boy say something rude again s2g I'll pop you in the mouth talking to me like that. The hell you think you are. Also Y U SO SECRETIVE?? WHAT YOU HIDING. I liked his humor.. Sort of. I like how he puts up a front as a defense mechanism so people won't get close too him but the rudeness has got to go boo boo, also if you're going to pretend you're constantly getting drunk and going to brothels you might as well get drunk and get laid if people already think that's what you're doing. Whatever anyway, he's alright. Nothing special like my precious Jem Jem doll. No one's as special as Jem *flips hair* Oh WAIT, Thomas. My Mundane!!! He had my heart.. And then Cassie threw it out the window. Thanks girl apprentice it. Hello Jessamine its your time to shine girl God loves ya. And by God I mean me. Jessa is literally me. Sassy and flaunting her riches. Except I don't have riches but shhh. She's doesn't want to be a showhunter and refuses to wear anything that doesn't make her look pretty. Yeah girl we're best friends. And then there's Tessa. Only slightly less annoying than Clary was. Loved her bravery, her cleverness, and how caring and determined she was. Hated her views on what a man and woman's role is. *Rolls eyes* So in conclusion, I wrote this review as if I were discussing it with a friend while having a fee drinks and I have no idea why. I will say that overall I enjoyed this immensely and will continue reading the rest of TID series because I have A LOT of questions I need answered. Also, Jem. Say no more. I am coming for you James Carstairs. The only reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because of the lack of distinction in similarities to TMI and *Drum roll* The sexism. I know, I know, we're in the 1800's and all but one thing that really infuriates me is sexism. And Tessa was CONSTANTLY pointing things out like \"But she's a woman, women don't fight.\" \"But she's a servant, AND a woman! And he's a MAN! She can't speak to him like that!\" REALLY NIGGA REALLY. I mean A+ to Cassie for getting the sexism views down right but I personally will never rate a book with sexism 5 stars due to personal experiences regarding what I should/should not/can/cannot do as a man. (Yes there's a long story behind that but I will not be sharing that.) ...more ***CAUTION: THERE WILL BE SPOILERS*** Wow, it was amazingly good, romantic, sad, funny, action-packed and totally this book mislead me. I never thought that that person was the Magister and I was like WTF because I never really thought that he was the villain and Nathaniel betrayed her sister Tessa, that was really shocking. And I also love the characters in this book as well my most favorite character was Jem, and I think I've fallen in love with him haha ^^. He's just so gentle and kind and I re ***CAUTION: THERE WILL BE SPOILERS*** Wow, it was amazingly good, romantic, sad, funny, action-packed and totally this book mislead me.

He's just so gentle and kind and I really love how Tessa and Jem met like it was so cute like Jem was playing his violin and I really like that scene. It just so sad though and it really make me teary-eyed that we've learned about his illness and that he's like slowly dying. And I really don't want him to die, can they find a freakin' cure so that Jem wouldn't die??? Whoooo I'm Team Jem!!!I like Will too but for me I love Jem more because Will can be an ass at times and he's like he's hot and then he's cold but since he reminds me of Jace Wayland I guess that in the end Will and Tessa will end up together. I just wish that Jem would live and they would find a cure and then he'll get a girl for him, maybe Sophie since she likes him. I also love about this book is the connection to the Mortal Instruments Series like Magnus Bane's here and there's the Lightwoods and the Waylands too. The Pandemonium and the Institute's there and we've finally knew how Church the cat arrived. If you've never read the Mortal Instruments series you can still read it because this is more of a companion book and the Infernal devices is another story/plot and you'll not be spoiled to the Mortal Instrument's plot. Note: The ending was a cliffhanger, like what the heck was that I don't get it??? ...more", "Title": "Clockwork Angel"},
