We need look no further than our own lives to recognize the problem we\u2019ll encounter if we preoccupy ourselves with the Tolstoyan \u201cunhappy family\u201d at the expense of the happy ones. Asked about our defining or most enlightening moments, most of us are as likely to recount happy memories as we are moments of despair. Yet too often, contemporary literature ignores this. Authors able to give the lie to Tolstoy by rendering joy as a complex substance are few and far between: think Ron Carlson,<---M> Laurie Colwin</---M>, Ellen Gilchrist, Richard Russo. In this context, <---A>Marilynne Robinson</---A>\u2019s <+++>Gilead</+++> comes not just as a breath of fresh air, but as a ray of light, quietly penetrating to the heart of mysteries regarding joy and love, life and death. Because it\u2019s written as a series of missives from the aged narrator to his young son, meant not to be read until long after the narrator\u2019s death, <+++>Gilead</+++> is largely plotless\u2014a conflict of sorts between the narrator and a friend\u2019s child does eventually develop, but it is a quiet conflict, and one that doesn\u2019t become clear until nearly halfway through the novel. The narrative is never as important as the meditations that surround it. This is a novel that celebrates life, that variegated communion between inner and outer worlds, between ego and experience. But Robinson is also concerned with death, not only as the inevitable end of that communion but also as its thematic counterpoint. If Robinson\u2019s territory here is the spiritual life of one man in particular, her thematic concern is how we in general can face the ends of our lives without despair or resort to existential reframings of the problem\u2014how we can face the prospect of death, in fact, with quiet gratitude and even joy. Robinson\u2019s portrayal of religion is especially deft; instead of opiate or panacea, her narrator\u2019s Christianity serves as a lens, providing a stasis and a vocabulary through which the novel can wrestle with its concerns. Ultimately, the quiet conclusions that Gilead seems to favor\u2014that the experience of existence is one that we should treasure as a gift, that we too often lose sight of the immense beauty of the world amidst our quotidian bustle, that love and charity have the power to remake lives\u2014are neither religious nor secular. Rather, they are humanist; they all concern a belief in the fundamental dignity of human lives. Is it melodramatic to say that these are the kind of quiet encouragements that we could usefully carry in our minds into the shadows of our own personal Gethsemanes? Regardless, Gilead offers us, in its portrait of a long life reflected upon with some degree of contentment, a reminder of just how deep, enthralling, and abidingly strange happiness can be. Perhaps the problem is not that happiness is not idiosyncratic enough to be worth investigating. The problem may be instead that happiness is simply too big for most writers to write convincingly about, that perhaps joy, like God, is too capacious to fully describe. Yet here is the rare novel that suggests insights into the natures of both. ...<---F>more This book is amazing</---F>.

This is one of the better books I have read. If this novel doesn't make you weep at some point, there is probably something seriously wrong with you. I'll admit that, like *Valley of the Dolls*, this book is probably not for everyone. But I really do recommend it to people who (<---B>like me</---B>) are not religious, and find others' faith difficult to understand. If you're able to respond empathically to characters in extremely well-written literature, this might be the best chance you get at entering this kind of experience. That was the way I felt about it, anyway. You only need to suspend some judgment you hold about religion, and take the protagonist's faith the way you would another belief or experience a fictional character might have that's diffferent from your own. I don't want to get carried away characterizing what the result of that was like for me, but I do recommend giving this book a try. ...more This novel reminds me\u2014with its beautifully spare prose and the bleak stoicism of its characters\u2014of three books: Per Petterson's Out Stealing Horses , Willa Cather's My \u00c1ntonia and Martin Amis's House of Meetings .

This is not meant as a statement of influence, but simply one of kinship. The writing in all of these novels is conversational in tone and beautifully compressed, which is enormously hard to do, though it appears easy. Gilead is the story of a Protestant pastor, the Reverent Ames, who, in the midwestern town of Gilead of about 1950 or so, writes to his then seven-year-old son. The pastor is dying and the letter is intended to be read when his son has reached adulthood. In it the pastor speaks of his grandfather and his father, and the long tradition of Christian ministry in the family, that, the writer assumes, will not continue with the recipient of the document which we, a little guiltily perhaps, hold in our hands. For the sense is very strong here of the reader as interloper, gazing at personal documents not meant for his eyes. And just as we surely know that what we read can only resolve itself in death and dissolution, and we brace ourselves for that end--we've been given fair warning--yet despite this we find that there is no way to steel ourselves for the conclusion. We know vaguely the shape it may take, and yet it still moves us indescribably. This to my mind is great writing and no merely clever metafictional trickery can ever supplant it. Christianity is not entirely the point of the story. Though the pastor has been driven by it the whole of his life and it's integral to his concern for family and flock, and the natural world, which he sees as pervaded by spirit at every level. Faith here is the means by which Marilynne Robinson shows us her characters' humanity, the tenuousness of their existence, their lives of suffering and loss, impermanence and fleetingness. It has been wonderful for this agnostic to see how the old school, middle-American Christianity used to work in a good man. That is to say, how it drives him to ecstasis, to open-heartedness and love and an almost unbearable joy. It's pretty heady stuff. No doubt those so inclined will find the novel a powerful affirmation of faith, which is a fine thing. My point is that it would be a mistake to read it solely as a Christian novel. Masters like Naguib Mahfouz and Isaac Bashevis Singer have produced similarly powerful fictions using far different religious contexts. And Ms. Robinson's excellent work, like theirs, transcends its religiosity to bring us something deeply universal. V.S Naipaul wrote in one of his books on Islam that the great gift of religious people is their confidence. How lovely, I've always felt, to be able to take solace in such belief. The Reverend Ames never wavers in his faith, but it is only by constant self-questioning that he's able to sustain it. Life is suffering. I have been wrong when I've thought of faith as an opiate. For the thinking person it is as challenging as any other form of mindful living. ...more paul schrader called his book on the films of bresson, ozu, and dreyer transcendental style in film . sorry, mr. schrader, for reducing your book and theory to a one-liner, but the transcendental style goes something like this: the intentional evenness and flatness (both visually and dramatically) of these films work to create a \u2018lifting\u2019 or revelation at the end, such as one may receive after hours of intense prayer, study, or meditation. as much as a book can fit within this category, i think G paul schrader called his book on the films of bresson, ozu, and dreyer transcendental style in film . sorry, mr. schrader, for reducing your book and theory to a one-liner, but the transcendental style goes something like this: the intentional evenness and flatness (both visually and dramatically) of these films work to create a \u2018lifting\u2019 or revelation at the end, such as one may receive after hours of intense prayer, study, or meditation. as much as a book can fit within this category, i think Gilead does. traditional narrative is replaced by the writings of one <---C>John Ames</---C>, a dying 77 yr old congregationalist minister \u2013 future readings intended for his young son in the form of warnings, anecdotes, memories, lessons, and personal thoughts mostly on god, existence, belief, morality, and family. (not nearly as heavy as it sounds. the tone's actually mellow and melancholy and conversational) i have the same problems that other atheists/agnostics/skeptics have with religion and its adherents, but, unlike many of them, i see no inherent problem in belief without proof. in fact, i see something beautiful, almost, in deeply held religious belief. a confession: remember when that tom cruise scientology video was leaked a while back? the one in which he was universally ridiculed and parodied by all non-scientologists? well, a part of me was envious of him. envious of the focus and intensity and aggression and passion he felt for this thing that seems so wildly ridiculous to me. belief is something we all crave. we crave it so bad it hurts. and it makes us crazy. it turns us into self-righteous assholes or hateful fundamentalist evangelicals or bitter fundamental atheists or suicide bombers or pacifists etc\u2026 but i can\u2019t believe. not in that sense anyway. i\u2019m just not built that way. i\u2019m scared shitless of an indifferent universe and a lack of absolute morality and the certainty that i will die and that every single person i know and love will die and that all of us, me and you and martin luther king and hitler, every one of us are just slabs of meat in a casket after we\u2019re gone. but even that can\u2019t make me believe without proof. and i waver between priding myself on adhering to the sad noble truth rather than the feel-good lie and between desperately wishing i could lighten the horrible burden of existence with the belief that we're all part of something larger than any of us can even fathom. and Gilead offers the best understanding i\u2019ve ever read concerning all of this stuff from the POV of one who holds a deep, unwavering belief in god and prescribed morality. totally unexpected from a contemporary author in the days of falwell, robertson, warren vs. hitchens, dennet, dawkins. Gilead is a gift for the lover of literature and for the religious person and perhaps, more than anyone, for the open minded skeptic. John Ames writes: I have always wondered what relationship this present reality bears to an ultimate reality\u2026 Our dream of life will end as dreams do end, abruptly and completely, when the sun rises, when the light comes. And we will think, All that fear and all that grief were about nothing. But that cannot be true. I can\u2019t believe we will forget our sorrows altogether. That would mean forgetting that we had lived, humanly speaking. Sorrow seems to me to be a great part of the substance of human life. if that last line doesn't do something to you, you ain't human. ...more My 4 year old son is going to die...sometime in the future, like me--wishfully long after me--and we'll have no more time to talk.

We should hopefully grow old together, but we'll grow old together as men. Yes, we'll always be father and son, but for the most part when we talk and share, he will be a man. What should I tell him now, as a boy? He's too young to remember, but I have so many things I want to say, to teach, to protect... There are things I want to tell him that are important now, that are things he will need to know when he becomes a man. What if I die unexpectedly, and soon. What will I tell my son then? Nothing. He'll only have short, gauzy, incomplete memories of me doing something random with him. Teaching him to brush his teeth, buckling his car seat, throwing him into the air, comforting him when the thunder cracks; a dreamlike sequence of me passing through his thoughts, being present during an action, laughing at something he's done, somewhere. That's not enough. If that had happened with my father, I would have the slimmest perception of who he was and from what human stock I was beget. I wouldn't know my father. It's like this with my maternal grandfather. He and I were never men together. I was a boy, he was a man, and then he died. My memories of him are far too narrow--Christmas vacation in out-county Kentucky, a family reunion in a church basement, him sitting with unknown relatives under a tree drinking lemonade during a summer so humid I remember perspiration under his arms and old man breasts and him calling black people 'the colored.' Whenever he left the house he wore a wool hat, respectable, perfunctory, polished, like men in the 1950s, and a cane was hooked over his knee when he sat under that shade tree calling people 'the colored.' I so desperately want to know that man, my grandfather. I still have my father. I knew him when I was young; I knew him as my superhero father; I know him as a man. Thank God. I hope it pans out this way with my son. But, again, if it doesn't, then what do I tell him, now, that will guide and foster him into adulthood? The answer is a journal. Capture my thoughts now, so that he can read them as a man, whenever he's ready. Pass my wisdom to him now, my thoughts, my lessons, my umbrage. Exactly that is the story of Gilead . The father is in his mid-70s in poor health, nearing the end. His son is 7. The father is a minister like his father and grandfather before. The time is 1956 Kansas. The entire book is a journal entry for his son, not to be read until he grows up and becomes a man, and maybe not even then if the son decides against reading it. That's his prerogative. But, at least the father makes it available to the son. The entire book is a beautiful confessional of short thoughts on life, entries almost like one of his thousands of hand-written sermons bundled up with twine in the attic. He uses the written space to reveal family history, personal passions, his philosophy, his love, the guiding influences of his life. The book starts: \"I told you last night that I might be gone sometime, and you said, Where, and I said, To be with the Good Lord, and you said, Why, and I said, Because I'm old, and you said, I don't think you're old. And you put your hand in my hand and you said, You aren't very old, as if that settled it. I told you you might have a very different life from mine, and from the life you've had with me, and that would be a wonderful thing, there are many ways to live a good life...It seems ridiculous to suppose the dead miss anything. If you're a grown man when you read this--it is my intention for this letter that you will read it then--I'll have been gone a long time. I'll know most of what there is to know about being dead, but I'll probably keep it to myself.\" (p. 3) What a beautiful idea. Thoughtful, responsible, loving, timeless. My son will be a man longer than he will be a child. Childhood and adolescence are critical for human development and building basic personality traits, but reason, judgment, and wisdom wait to arrive until adulthood. That's when I need to talk to my son. So, unless I can promise my son I'll always be there, I need to sit down, collect my thoughts, and start writing a long letter to him. It will tell him how I grew up and learned about myself; it will tell him my joys and my strengths and my fears; it will tell him how I would do it all over again exactly the same way, and not to be so hard on himself; I'll tell him how I met his mother, and how our lives turned out so differently from the plans we made, but still so wonderfully; I'll tell him how I watched him grow up and rolled his ghostly thin and white belly skin between my fingers; I'll tell him how carefully he tottered over uneven ground; tell him how he always woke up with the same crazy bed hair, no matter the season or the length of hair or where he slept--always splayed out in the back and ruffled on the left; I'll tell him how I loved him in so many ways and know he'll be a great man and brother and father; I'll tell him people are mean, but not always; I'll tell him I loved rain to any other kind of weather; tell him to read more often; tell him to write to his kids. And when I write my journal, I'll have moments like this, I'm sure: \"I have been looking through these pages, and I realize that for some time I have mainly been worrying to myself, when my intention from the beginning was to speak to you. I meant to leave you a reasonably candid testament to my better self, and it seems to me now that what you must see here is just an old man struggling with the difficulty of understanding what it is he's struggling with.\" (p. 202) Gilead is unique because of the subtle power of its narrative. It's a short book with simple writing, yet the father wrestles with the complexities of his faith, the enormity of life, and the profundity of culture and social values. Hidden beneath the plangent chords of his testimonial are approaches to deep chambers of religious philosophy and human nature. Marilynne Robinson achieves an awkward--but successful--balance in the book between, on one hand, a laser-focus on spirituality and, on the other, a broad, comprehensive account of one family's history and nature. It works, and it won the Pulitzer. However, for me, the book would have been better if the father wasn't a minister, and instead something more general like a farmer, entrepreneur, or laborer. Why? Because a minister lives his profession, always, unable to filter his thoughts and experiences through any other than a spiritual sieve. Everything a minister does is guided by religious precedent, biblical law and morality, and Godly intent. This minister--the father--was a good Christian, so there was only minor human infraction to reveal, and never scandal or salaciousness to confess. Instead, that kind of debauch was revealed in the confessions of a few members of his congregation. The minister led a life that was both very human but also very sterile. Compassionate but not very intriguing. Every man sins, yet there was very little confession from the minister. When I write to my son, I will reveal from my life the embarrassments, the pejoratives, the vice, and the shortcomings that make me whole. I think that's more realistic. Another great comment: \"Why do I love the thought of you old? That first twinge of arthritis in your knee is a thing I imagine with all the tenderness I felt when you showed my your loose tooth. Be diligent in your prayers, old man. I hope you will have seen more of the world than I ever got around to seeing--only myself to blame. And I hope you will have read some of my books. And God bless your eyes, and your hearing also, and of course your heart. I wish I could help you carry the weight of many years. But the Lord will have that fatherly satisfaction.\" (p. 210) And so, 4 year old son of mine, if this review happens to be one of the written items you use to piece together a picture of your father, let me tell you this: I love you. I love your smell when you cry, the color on your cheeks in the summer, your early sense of humor, the spitting laugh you hold back when I tickle you, and the lines on the bottoms of your soft, pink feet. You don't necessarily have to be religious, but I think the secret to the world is to is to love one another. Be nice. Always take care of your siblings--even if they take a wrong turn here or there. That happens. Take your time, find the right spouse, and please have kids. Your dad gave Gilead 4 stars; give it a try. Maybe therein you'll see something of me.

After all, in a novel about an old man reminiscing about faith and family, there\u2019s a plethora of weighty spiritual content; everything from careful exegesis of Genesis 22 to references to Karl Barth\u2019s Epistle to the Romans. Needless to say, this is no simple \u201cI remember when\u2026\u201d fable of love and loss. Issues are being grappled with, weighed and eschewed. However, to review the novel from a theological stance cannot merely mean discussing old John Ames\u2019 opinions on war, forgiveness or predestination. That job belongs primarily to his congregants and family within the narrative. The question I, the reader, encountered was of the theology of a book wherein the entire premise is of a man wishing to leave a testament of his \u201cbetter self\u201d (p. 202) for his seven year old, but spends his final days journaling, instead of spending time with his son. This is the battle I fought with John Ames and Marilynne Robinson throughout my reading. It began when I realized that about every four pages I found myelf drowsing off to sleep, or thinking of topics far beyond the narrator\u2019s journal entries. As I had approached the novel with great enthusiasm (fiction at last!) I wondered what could be sending my mind off into orbit. Why the dissociation? From the frustration with not being able to stay focused from page to page, paragraph to paragraph, soon emerged actual anger. I found myself choosing to put the book down and find other activities, almost as if to spite the narrator. Something was wrong. I was refusing to sit passively and listen. With a little reflection, this is what I discovered. I was incredibly angry that John Ames was writing on and on about how much he loved his son and his wife and how he wished he wasn't about to die, and there he was, \u201creflecting\u201d instead of living! Enter the transference. I realized how little tolerance I had for the \u201cnobility\u201d of a strong, silent-type preacher man finally unloading the deepest parts of his heart and soul onto paper, instead of through interaction. The drowsiness coming over me was of not wanting to listen to this man write. I wanted to see him take action. I didn\u2019t want to honor him by reading his last testament, because I do not respect the idea that somehow, as long as you say what you feel before you die, it doesn\u2019t matter how little you expressed to those around you until that point. The book brought up anger with my father, his father, and the generations of quiet, long-suffering, missionary-type men I am descended from. Though I am not a man, nor very quiet, I know about long-suffering, and I could not suffer the boredom or veiled anger that lay between the lines of John Ames\u2019 memoirs. I wanted to rip the journal from his hands, and essentially, tell Marilynne Robinson that I refuse to applaud her character\u2019s poetry, theology or self-reflection, when he is in essence, taking the easy way out of sharing himself. I\u2019ll admit, there are plenty of passages in the novel that show Ames\u2019 growth and interaction with others. Even the fact that he married late in life reveals that he was unsatisfied persisting in the loneliness of listening to baseball games on the radio, writing sermons and hiding from neighbors when they knocked on his door. However, all his loving descriptions of sunsets, children\u2019s laughter and the smell of raindrops, appear hollow the moment he starts describing his son playing outside as he writes. In that the entire purpose of the novel is for this aging father to express his heart to his son, for all the descriptions of moments of communion, (p. 103), I gained no sense whatsoever of how this father related to his son. Every human interaction Ames (Robinson) writes is marked by constraint, weariness and shy civility. The aching lack of intimacy in this novel made every page a grueling ordeal to wade through. \u201cTake action!\u201d I shouted. \u201cStop writing!\u201d I\u2019m left to wonder what Robinson feels about her main character. I sense that she adores his humble (though never na\u00efve) faith, and the grace he tries to offer others. But the portrait she paints, or at least the format she has chosen to use, counteracts any message I might derive from the old preacher\u2019s wisdom and experience. By writing the story as a last testament in-progress, Robinson has created an utterly passive character, a true bystander of the life he is narrating. I don\u2019t believe this was her goal. We are clearly supposed to revel in the homely and kindly spiritual reflections of a faithful old coot that is continually surprised by beauty. But for this passive bystander, I felt mostly pity, and quite a bit of anger. Another perspective, however, is that Robinson has rightly captured the unfortunate experience of so many pastors, especially of Ames\u2019 (and my grandfather\u2019s) generation: that of distance and objectivity. My grandfather once spoke of a minister he served under who believed it was un-Christian for a minister to befriend his congregants because it would cloud his ability to pastor. Can we even imagine a pastor who would not eat supper at a parishioner\u2019s home? Does Ames\u2019 loner quality, his reticence to become entangled, simply reflect the expectations put on a country preacher? This was the time (and the concept persists in some realms) where the pastor was expected to run every aspect of the church. Ames\u2019 statement that everyday felt essentially like Sunday because once one sermon was over, it was already time to work on the next (p. 232-233), reflects the overburdened lifestyle of one who is expected to shepherd whole congregations by sheer determination and will power- with no rest or support system other than other local pastors (Boughton). This symptomatic lone wolf quality made it difficult for me to believe Ames\u2019 speculations on relationships, because I could hear his strained resentment trying to come out. (It finally emerges somewhat in regards to being given a godson without his consent, and over Jack Boughton\u2019s flagrant disrespect for others). I have not written much of Ames and Jack Boughton, mostly because the character was introduced far too late in the novel to bear the climactic significance it was clearly supposed to have. The real story should have been how Ames chooses to reveal himself and be present with his young son, not his struggle to give grace to his black sheep of a godson. That is indeed significant, but is again, un-served by the journal format of the book. The developing story of Jack Boughton\u2019s struggles have no place in Ames\u2019 letters to his son. Confined by Robinson\u2019s poorly chosen device, the last fourth of the book (despite being the most readable) breaks the rules set in the beginning of Ames writing to his son. Instead, the reader encounters Robinson\u2019s clunky exposition about the life of a character we have not been effectively convinced to care about. Overall, this is my greatest criticism for the novel, both artistically and theologically: it\u2019s nearly impossible to care for these characters when they are introduced as part of an avoidant old man\u2019s journal entry. The richer story to be told here is that of an old man opening his heart through action and engagement with his community, after a long life of loneliness. In order to experience this part of the story, Robinson needed to give us voices other than Ames to listen to. Ames\u2019 emotional distance in interpersonal relationships makes his spiritual and poetic ruminations fall short of the impact Robinson so clearly intended. This novel made my heart ache; wanting the silent men in my life to get up from their journals, and actually say what they\u2019re thinking. And this, perhaps, is too much to require of a novel. Is it too much to require of these old men as well? Isn\u2019t the real point of a last testament the admittance that too much has gone unsaid? Should we celebrate a theology that waits too long to speak? ...more I believe the audio of this book is read by Santa Claus, so that is nice. Not nice enough for me to finish it, though. I tried the printed copy and the audio, and while I made it slightly farther in the audio, I just can\u2019t do it. I think listening to this in the car creates a severe hazard because of the imminent danger of me falling asleep. Having read Olive Kitteridge and this, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the Pulitzer committee is looking for books about bumbling old people whose kids may I believe the audio of this book is read by Santa Claus, so that is nice. Not nice enough for me to finish it, though. I tried the printed copy and the audio, and while I made it slightly farther in the audio, I just can\u2019t do it. I think listening to this in the car creates a severe hazard because of the imminent danger of me falling asleep. Having read Olive Kitteridge and this, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the Pulitzer committee is looking for books about bumbling old people whose kids may or may not like them. It\u2019s probably a somewhat universal theme, except for someone like me who knows how I feel about my parents and does not have children, but is it a compelling theme? After a while, I don\u2019t really care whether the kids like them or not. I just want them to stop talking about how bread was cheaper in their day, uphill both ways in the snow barefoot. It seems like there are two completely valid reasons this book would be a compelling read for a person. First, I can hypothetically see how the nature of an older father writing to a young son before the father dies might hit some kind of nostalgia button for people concerned about their own or their parents\u2019 death. That seems understandable. I don\u2019t really have anything to say about that or feel that way, but maybe the rambling nature of this book would hold some kind of charm if you felt like that. Maybe if this old gentleman were my grandfather, I would feel more interested. But, then again, maybe not. Maybe I am just hardened to this type of thing. Second, I think there might be something about the religious and spiritual ideas in here that might seem charming and identifiable to either someone who hates religion altogether or someone who is surrounded by unreasonable religion. Again, that seems fair, and I don\u2019t really have much to say about it. I don\u2019t think I am in any of those spaces, so this book to me was more like someone approaching me on the street, when I\u2019m late to an appointment, and trying to tell me about how he recently bought gum, and what the clerk who sold it said to him, and his various thoughts about sprinkling versus emersion baptism. I am happy to say I have no opinion about those things, nor do I think they are interesting. Luckily, I have the option of walking away from this rambling stranger and moving on to other strangers who might be talking about things that are more actively interesting to me. ...more Gilead

The first person father writing to his son narrative was horrid. I felt like the entire book was one run-on sentence - not because the sentences were lengthy - but rather because it was written as rambling musings of an old man I neither cared about nor related to. Plus, the sentences were a clunky patchwork of memories and present day reflections that did not connect smoothly. If the story was more linear, the \"journal\" style mechanism that Marilynne Robinson used could possibly make the novel enjoyable. Or readable. Unlike the majority, I did not find the old man's reflections insightful - at all. The stories, memories, regrets, doctrine, in essence every single subject broached was so flippin, tear my hair out, boring. Call me ageist, but the stream of consciousness of a 77 year old comes across as senility not sentimentality. I can only assume Robinson was going for the latter.

Ames is a preacher, and much of what he discusses is couched in terms of his religion and his beliefs, but what he is facing and has faced in life is so universal that even an atheist might relate. As Ames details the closing days of his life, we see the way his faith supports and comforts him, but we also see the edges at which things blur and become beyond his understanding. We see his flaws and we catch reflections of how he was shaped by his father and grandfather, who were preachers as well. This is a complex book that delves very deeply into humanity and the intricacies of human relationships and how our views of one another can be skewed even when we come from a place in a good heart. I loved the soft, loving voice of this character and his desire to be open-minded and kind, even when he felt threatened and disconnected. The first-person voice took me right inside his mind and heart and I felt I knew him in all his glories and faults. Near the end of the book, he offers a blessing to another character, which felt like a personal blessing for me as well. This book is the first in a series and I am anxious to get the next installment and see if there are questions answered for some of the loose threads. Robinson is a marvelous writer. I am confident that she will not disappoint me. ...more I am so disappointed with this book.

But my issue is that it is only beautiful in parts. On the whole it is a tedious story, and there are indeed the longueurs. In fact I actually found the style somewhat pedestrian. The upshot of this was that I skim-read many pages. I have no problems with epistolary novels. John Williams succeeded brilliantly with \u201cAugustus\u201d. However, the writing style didn\u2019t seem to quite work here. What is interesting though is how this novel came into being. I can actually see Marilynne Robinson as she says: I was in the desert in east Oregon and I saw a full moon rising as the sun was setting... it was absolutely brilliant, lovely and amazing. Then I had this picture of an old man sitting at a desk writing while a child was playing beside him on the floor. (3 April 2005) Gilead is about the reminiscences of the Rev. John Ames, a seventy-seven year-old minister, who on finding out that he is terminally ill, decides to write to Robert, his seven-year-old son who he knows he will never see grow up. But this novel is \u2026much more than a letter and closer to a testament to a lost America of slaves, preachers and self-improving republicans. This fusion of a majestic natural world with the everyday drama of family life is quintessential Robinson. \u2026Which brings us to the Civil War. Gilead is narrated in 1956 and has a post-war consciousness which reflects its author's childhood. The narrative is modern but permeated by the war. Ames's grandfather is a man who, having seen a vision of Christ in Maine, came west to Kansas to fight for the abolition of slavery, and is said to have \u201cpreached\u201d men into the Civil War . The text did become slightly more enjoyable with the reunion after twenty years of the Rev. Robert Boughton, John Ames\u2019 lifelong friend, and his prodigal son, Jack. But nevertheless\u2026 When I think how much I loved reading Laila (Gilead #3) and I still think about it. I was so looking forward to reading Gilead (Gilead #1) . I could cry actually that this book has had this negative effect on me. Still if something is negative in life, either mentally or physically, then the best thing, such as being tossed from a horse, is to get straight back on again.

And, she does it without ever getting cheesy or preachy. Reading this book is like floating in a pool on a warm summer day. It's dreamy and it's beautiful. It's sad, but not depressing. It's about life and death and everything in between. It captures a bit of history and mid-century Middle American attitude expertly. I truly love this book. There a couple of people I want to pass my copy on to, but I'm afraid I'll never see it again. I think this is one of the rare books I will be reading again and again. ...more Ponderous.

My guess is that after twenty years of not writing, Robinson sat down with the idea of writing a book that would sum up everything she's learned while living on this big blue planet. And indeed, all the big-name reviewers would have you believe that the text slows you down so you can savor each sentence and philosophical musing. Well I'm here to tell you that the Emperor has no clothes and that the text slows you down because it is BORING. I knew it was time to stop reading around page 50 when I took a break, picked it up again, and thought, \"Dear God, we're back at the henhouse again?\" I can't even get all that worked up about how dull this book was.

I understand the praise for this book. And I understand when people say that in fifty or one hundred years people will still be reading this book and finding something deeply human in it. Gilead is a book about love and hope. It's one long letter of an old midwestern reverend to his son. And it is brimming with everything there is in life that is beautiful. It reminded me a lot of watching Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life which I love. And I love this book. It is a religious book, but it does not require the reader to be religious. It reflects things that are innately human and that people struggle with everyday. It is befitting the young and the old. It resonated with me, as a twenty-something, but I can see it being even more relevant for parents, grandparents, the elderly. I can see myself reading this again in my life, and if I ever become a father, something I would need to read again. And though I read it so quickly, I'm thankful for the time I had to completely immerse myself in this man's mind, in his relationship to his wife and son, and his sage reflection on life, love, spirituality, forgiveness, and hope. ...more John Ames is a pastor in the forsaken town of Gilead.

It precludes the best eventualities along with the worst.\u201d The father-son (and Holy Ghost) relationship is very much at the heart of this novel\u2019s traction. The first half of the novel has a languid old world pace, brimming with tenderness and somewhat idealised musings on the beauty of life (the world appears glorious in the light of Ames\u2019 imminent departure from it) and on family and the town of Gilead\u2019s history. \u201cSometimes I have loved the peacefulness of an ordinary Sunday. It is like standing in a newly planted garden after a warm rain.\u201d You can feel the silent and invisible life.\u201d Reading the languorous gentle lilt of Robinson\u2019s prose is like being up in a tree house with the huge night sky spiralling its stars overhead, and like the stars the text raises both wonder and elementary doubts. Ames creates a tapestry of all the things that have formed him. Except there\u2019s a sense of selective memory playing a big part. Ames, understandably, wants to paint a flattering portrait of himself. About half way through I was almost beginning to run out of patience with his benevolent tender self-serving musings, wondering where the novel was going. Then Jack Boughton arrives on the scene and the novel acquires all the contrast and tension it was beginning to lack. Jack is the wayward son of his best friend. As a teenager he stole from Ames, deliberately seeking to antagonise him. Ames doesn\u2019t like him. He especially doesn\u2019t like him when he begins playing with his boy and talking to his wife. All of a sudden Ames begins to appear less than Christian, shadowed and soured by envy and resentment. Jack is a kind of shadow self, an alter-ego with whom Ames has to reconcile and the second half of this novel is a moving account of his struggle to find the necessary forgiveness within himself to bring about this reconciliation. What Gilead lacks in momentum and dramatic tension is more than compensated for by the life affirming wisdom it contains in such generous measure. ...more Read a book that won the Pulitzer Prize. 3.5 stars rounded up Ok ya'll, this review is gonna get personal.

There are a thousand thousand reasons to live this life, every one of them sufficient. This was my book club's selection for May. I've kind of been in a reading slump the past few months and just haven't been reading with the fervor that I'm used to. I've been really busy with work and other adventures, and nothing seemed to grab me or hold my interest, and every single time I had a spare few moments to read, I decided to sleep instead. It happens. So I went to book club last Friday with only maybe 50 pages read, feeling that horrible shame that I let the ladies down, but filled with promises that I would read it soon. And I was at book club for maybe 10 minutes when I got a phone call from my dad who said nothing to me except that I needed to come to the hospital as quickly as I could get there. I drove to the hospital where I found my dad and my mom's sister outside on the phone. I approached and heard my dad say \"I need to get off the phone and talk to Jess.\" Never a good sign. That is the night I found out my uncle died. He had been fishing by himself and somehow tripped and fell and became unconscious in the water where he drowned. I can't even really remember those next few minutes. I remember being in shock and hitting my dad as he tried to hug me. I remember running away and collapsing. Sobbing uncontrollably. Not letting anyone touch me. Refusing to believe what I had just heard. Now I realize that 99% of you who read this don't know me in real life. I am not a very emotional person. I don't cry easily, especially in front of other people. I am the person in my family who takes pain and emotion and news like this and becomes a rock for everyone around me, and then later in my own time in my own way, I grieve and deal the only way I know how. Alone. My grandmother died at the end of March. I didn't cry at her funeral. Not because I wasn't sad. It's just not what I do. This book is 247 pages of the words of congregationalist minister, John Ames in the 1950s. He is old, at the end of his life, and has a heart condition which causes him to become slower and weaker than he is used to. He married a much younger woman whom he loves fiercely, and who loves him (it appears) just as fiercely. They have a seven-year-old son. John Ames is writing this knowing that his son will never really know him, and wants some kind of testament to his life, his love, his family, and his faith for his son to read some day to understand the father he never knew. And in doing so, he expresses a lot of knowledge and insight on the human condition, and why we behave the way we do. Though this book is a work of fiction and it is set more than 50 years ago, the universality of what he is saying is so raw and so full of meaning that it can be appreciated by almost anyone, of any age, during any time period. It was such a hard book to read because it will always and forever remind me of my uncle because of where I was the night he died, but reading this in the days following his death really affected me and really spoke so many truths that I want to focus on. My uncle was a wonderful wonderful man, and he and my mom were very close. I was also incredibly close to him and knew how great a man he was, but it wasn't until his viewing and funeral that I came to understand just how great he was. I live in a very small rural Pennsylvania town, and I believe close to 1000 people attended either his viewing or his funeral or both. That is a testament to how many lives he touched. People I had never seen before, never heard of before. He worked as a manager at the meat counter of a small privately-owned grocery store, and the store closed the day of the funeral so that every employee could come. Because every employee wanted to. Because they all loved him. So many people were there who were simply customers at the grocery store, and only knew him because they bough their groceries from him. I heard stories about how he would be in the back processing meat, and he would see elderly customers and would come out to help them carry their bags to their cars. There was no person he wouldn't talk to or get to know. Younger guys who worked with him absolutely crushed and sobbing telling me stories about how Lonny taught them to fish or taught them to hunt, or invited them to golf with him and his friends. High school students who worked part-time in the summer, so upset at his passing. My grandmother has been in a nursing home for three years. Lonny spent every single night with her. He got to know every single resident at that facility and their families. I met so many families of residents at the nursing home who came to the funeral because they had gotten to know Lonny just from his visiting their loved ones. Nurses and staff members from the nursing home came to pay their respects. Because seriously, every single person who met my uncle was affected by him. And loved him. This brings me back to this book. The first half really really rambled on and on for me. It's the reason I only went with a 3.5 instead of a 4. It was slow and boring, and I couldn't really grasp the greatness of it. But as I read, and the words began to sink in for me, I started to realize how cathartic reading this book was. This book is the musings of an old man at the end of his life, trying to impart some knowledge on to his son. I realized just how important being able to do that is. We never got the chance to say goodbye to my uncle. He never got to write a letter to his daughter or his wife or his father who was his best friend in the world. He didn't get a chance to look back on his life and family and realize what he wanted still to do with the sparse time he had left. But when I left the funeral home on Thursday, I realized he didn't need to. He was a man who didn't have any regrets. He lived every single day on Earth as if it would be his last. He fiercely loved my aunt Penny whom he had been with for 30 years. He was an absolutely amazing father to my cousin Mary whom he just watched graduate from college. Unfortunately he will not be there to walk her down the aisle at her wedding next June. And he will not be there to hold his grandkids. But he left this earth doing what he loved to do and not regretting a thing. It makes me think about how I would be remembered if I died tomorrow. I can't say the same thing about my life. As I reflect on life, and my uncle's in particular, I know I would like to keep a piece of his soul with me, and live life more like he did. The narrator of this novel is, as I said, a congregationalist minister. So of course, there is a lot of faith in this book. However, I would not in any way classify this as Christian fiction, or even a religious novel. His faith has kind of a universality to it that I think can touch anybody. Though I consider myself spiritual, I am not a very religious person myself, do not attend church, but I come from a very religious family. The themes that are present such as faith, forgiveness, love, strength of conviction, morality, and doubt seem to cross all lines. I urge all of my friends to read this at some point, and see what you can get out of it. I found the writing to be beautiful and full of insight into what it's like to be human. It really moved me, particularly in the end. I apologize for my long-windedness, but I feel like I needed to get all this off my chest, as it had been burdening me for far too long. And I know a lot of my friends have been wondering about my antisocialness as of late, and wanted to give my version of things. I urge you all not only to read this book, but to also live your lives a little more like my uncle. Seize the moment. Be kind. Seek out ways to be a better person. Pay it forward. And, my most important lesson from it all: forgive. Forgive. Forgive. You never ever know when your last day will be. ...more \u062f\u06cc\u0634\u0628 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u0645 \u0645\u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0631\u0648\u0632\u06cc

the neck. His personal and circular logic goes nowhere, and his daily ministrations, well, you really couldn't give less a care about. And this is truly awful folks. These are deep thoughts from father to son, directly from the death bed. And the main thought through this all becomes: Wow, dude's taking his awful sweet-ass time to die. First of all, I have some disclaiming to do. I do not believe in God, not even in the most hazy, nondenominational sense of an impersonal 'force' that vouchsafes existence.

I do not believe in God, not even in the most hazy, nondenominational sense of an impersonal 'force' that vouchsafes existence. I was raised Catholic (halfheartedly)\u2014by which I mean that I was sent to Catholic school, but my parents were never demonstratively or actively Catholic. They only rarely attended church (precipitated, I think, by a sense of lapsed duty), they never prayed, to my knowledge, and they mostly refrained from any mention of gods or spirits or the afterlife. I guess you could say I grew up in an atmosphere of profound religious ambiguity, which gave me the impression, rightly or not, that we were obliged to bow our heads in deference to the religious arts but we surely weren't supposed to take it all too seriously. Religion, in other words, was a palliative ritual\u2014working in much the same way a fairy tale does for a child\u2014to distract us from more austere truths about life and death. Of course, I was a child then. I never formulated these ideas succinctly, and now I'm only trying to translate an eroding childhood impression that I can still recall from time to time. Marilynne Robinson's Gilead is told from the perspective of a dying (Protestant) preacher named John Ames who lives in a small town in Iowa named Gilead. He is writing a testament of sorts to his young son, who is six years old and is the product of a marriage to a considerably younger woman. Both Ames' grandfather and father were preachers, but their relationship was fraught with conflicts both personal and ideological. His grandfather was a stern, fire-and-brimstone preacher who viewed war as the most effective means to achieve greater social justice, while his father was a pacifist and a quieter, more restrained man. Ames and his family live near his lifelong friend, a Presbyterian minister named Boughton, who is also quite old and suffering from poor health. (The book described Ames as a Congregationalist. I'm not very familiar with the various Protestant denominations, but the text led to me to understand that his religion is Calvinist in orientation. I should note here\u2014as further disclaimer\u2014that the Calvinist concept of predestination was greatly disturbing to this impressionable young Catholic boy when he was learning about competing doctrines in school.) Boughton has quite a few grown children, but none of them live in Gilead; his daughter Glory has returned temporarily to care for him as his health falters and\u2014near the beginning of the book\u2014Boughton's prodigal son Jack returns, with his perpetual smirk and his unknown motives. Ostensibly, Ames is writing this testament\u2014the book Gilead itself\u2014because he expects that he will die long before his son reaches maturity; he intends to explain his past and his views and instill an impression of himself in a boy who will never really know him in any profound sense. Somewhere along the way, however, he gets distracted by Jack's return to Gilead and the all feelings it stirs up in him. Reckoning with Jack Boughton almost becomes a final test for the old man; on the one hand, he recognizes his duties toward Jack, not only as the son of a good friend but also as a child of God, but on the other hand, he's dogged by what he considers his unfair and antagonistic feelings for the young man, which stem from a sordid incident in past. Although Ames, at the time of his writing, is occasionally troubled by feelings of inadequacy, I think he's what I'd call an exemplary Christian, and I certainly don't mean that it in an ironic or smug way. I could list any number of adjectives that would explain to you what I mean, incidentally speaking\u2014such as that he's calm, patient, well-meaning, learned, questioning, caring, thinking, etc. \u2014but I think all these many qualities and more are the product of one essential striving in John Ames: he is always working at refining, improving, and reconsidering himself. He hasn't become petrified in a state of self-satisfaction or righteousness. Of course, this isn't only a Christian ideal; it's a human ideal. But I think many Christians get confused when it comes to matters of faith. They mistakenly believe that their faith should not entertain doubts\u2014that it should be steadfast and unbending. On the contrary, I think faith only gains value because it endures in the face of doubt. Belief isn't a fixed destination at the end of a spiritual journey; it's a continuous striving\u2014and it's very hard work. Marilynne Robinson elegantly and tenderly brings John Ames' thoughts\u2014and even more profoundly\u2014his feelings to life in this miraculous little book. I say that it's miraculous because it fosters understanding across seemingly unbridgeable ideological divides and shows us that many of our most essential ideals are often quite similar, regardless of the trappings of dogmatism or sect. And that's all well and good, of course, but Robinson's success here is so unequivocal because John Ames is real and true and resoundingly alive for all of the book's two-hundred-fifty pages... ...more Yes, I have now read this THREE times.

The basic plot (such as it is - this is a character driven book in the most basic sense): An old preacher finds out that he is dying, and writes a journal/memoir to his seven year old son. There are a couple of breathtaking scenes in the book, that have stuck with me. The narrator remembers a time in his childhood, in the late 19th century, when the local church burned down. The community came out in force to clean up the wreckage and salvage what could be salvaged. The women sang hymns while they worked. It began to rain, and the girl's skirts were dirty and wet, and their hair hung down their backs. His father offered him bread from his hands, covered in ash and soot. To the narrator, this was the most important \"communion\" of his life. The image comes up over and over again, and the theme is repeated when the narrator gives his son communion in his own church many years later (although he is too young to formally take communion). I thought it was so beautiful, the essence of what communion should be about. Which brings me to another thing I loved about the book: The strong sense of generations, the passing of love and knowledge and problems from father to son through the generations. As my friend Elizabeth says, the book lingers long on issues of masculinity. I related so strongly to the characters that I didn't even really notice that until it was pointed out to me! But it's true, this is a book about how to be a righteous man (in the best, least judgmental meaning of \"righteous\"), and how to grow your sons into righteous men. I also loved the very last scene. I don't want to spoil it, but it is so beautiful. This is one of those rare novels where the end does not disappoint. And, of course, there's the rhythm of the narration, and the language. So slow, lilting, sad, and lovely, like one of the slower Sacred Harp hymns I love to sing. It's almost Homeric, in the sense that it feels like oral history, with the rhythm of very old-fashioned storytelling. Reading around on Goodreads, this is apparently something many readers found difficult and criticize on their reviews. I can see that it's an acquired taste. I loved it, but I read older novels all the time, constantly seeking out that softer, slower, more detailed rhythm of writing that seemed more common pre-TV. If your obsessions tend more towards the cyber-punk post-modern, this book might seem too heavy and slow - in fact, it has almost no plot at all, which might throw some people off. But of course, the adoption of an older style is, in itself, a bit interesting and pastiche-y. But now I'm out of my comfort zone - I'll let someone else deconstruct it. Meanwhile, I highly recommend this book to all of my serious, thoughtful, passionate friends who like serious, thoughtful, passionate books. ...more With race again in the news from the USA (view spoiler) [ and sadly that seems a safe thing to write that unfortunately is unlikely to date this review (hide spoiler) ] it seems worth while returning to Marilynne Robinson's book because beneath the gentle stream of consciousness ramblings of an elderly preacher who is approaching death something challenging hides.

Although set in 1956 the narrator's reflections flicker back and forth from the time of his grandfather - a pastor active in the abolitionist movement and the border violence of the 1850s and the present. Particularly to the problems of his godson and namesake which also involve issues of race and responsibility similar to those which swallowed up his grandfather's life. However we are not only invited by the author to compare the personal issues faced by these different generations but also to consider they in their broader context as the narrator contrasts the town that he lives in now, decaying and shrinking, abandoned even by the narrator's father and brother, with the period of its optimistic growth and sense of purpose in the 1850s. Indeed if that wasn't enough the book's title - Gilead is the hill of testimony - is also a call to consider what is being testified. The town when it was founded had a purpose. It was part of the underground railroad. The Grandfather had a purpose. He fought for an end to slavery. Man and society were engaged in a cause and had a calling. However the nobility is undercut by the reality. The town's people were accident prone - one escaped slave asks them to leave him alone as he figures he's better off without their help. The grandfather is caught up in a retreat during the civil war and loses his Bible. Probably the message is subtler. A noble cause isn't enough, it isn't easy to accomplish it well even with the best intentions. Or even if your calling is predestined that doesn't mean that God intends the pursuit of it to be easy. The godson, having avoided military service (and is able to quote chapter and verse in support of why it is better for a coward to avoid war), escaped an earlier relationship and a child born out of wedlock is now in a transgressive inter-racial relationship. The question of whether the town of Gilead can offer him and his love a home is one that is put to the narrator late in the book. There's testimony to the difficulty of living up to a calling, predestined or not. The narrator's father refuses to have a copy Feuerbach in the house. The narrator has to read it secretly instead. But ultimately the Father abandons Gilead and goes off with his atheist son to California instead. Though I suppose California could be said to be a kind of promised land, it looks like a retreat from the moral high ground. A physical relocation that parallels his spiritual dislocation from the distinctly old testament grandfather. By the mid 50s the town seems to have failed. It has slunk into some kind of limbo were faith is safe and not a challenge to believers (challenging is possibly one of the milder words that could be used to describe the Grandfather's behaviour). It no longer seems to be worthy of having been called \"The Shining Star of Radicalism\" as U.S. Grant put it. What we see with the Father and the atheist brother going to California and more particularly the failure of the town, of the state and of the law to reject the socially dominant views on race is the failure of the present to remain true to their original purpose and as a result there conceptions are narrow and ungenerous. The godson with his black wife and mixed race children can find no refuge here. But all of this are just soft ramblings and different threads of meaning can be teased out of them in between the narrator's reflections on late fatherhood, the approach of death, a lucky marriage, the slight but growing sense of a missed calling and the awkwardness of mistaken judgements. Fear not however, Gilead remains a subtler and more approachable read than you would expect any novel that features a conversation about predestination to have a right to be! ...more The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it is well-written, from a formal standpoint.

He reminisces about regrets and moments of epiphany as well as the role of his own father and grandfather, his wife and son, the wife and child he lost, his neighbours. It is small-town America in the 1950s, but his thoughts span a century and go back to the Civil War which his own grandfather participated in. It is, in this way, very much an American novel. The way it explores faith, too, seems to be both personal and national/American at the same time, which might explain why Barack Obama had a conversation with Marilynne Robinson in November last year.* It may also explain why I failed to fully connect with it or appreciate it to the extent many others have. As an agnostic (I suppose) I sometimes felt weighed down by the theological ramblings, though at other times I was drawn into John Ames\u2019s musings when they didn\u2019t rely too heavily on Scripture. The narrative voice of the old man was thoroughly convincing, as was the confessional tone, the testimony of a parent\u2019s love for his child. Despite this there was something in the near-epistolary style that made me feel removed from it, as if I was being told John Ames\u2019s story but never saw any of it for myself. Perhaps that was why I was easily distracted during the reading of it. I very much enjoy philosophical novels, and in this novel, too, I found myself agreeing with many of the thoughts expressed by the old reverend, this for instance: My present bewilderments are a new territory that make me doubt I have ever really been lost before. But as these thoughts were more often clothed in a strict sense of faith, to my mind at least, I often didn\u2019t feel they could be my thoughts. A quote early on expresses my feelings about this, and John Amos\u2019s own (talking about Feuerbach, a man whose books his brother has read, after which he left the small town of Gilead, considering it a backwater): Of course he thinks religion could just stand out of the way and let joy exist pure and undisguised. That is his one error, and it is significant. See, I wish it had been a discussion of faith and not a one-sided conviction in which the sceptics/agnostics are considered \u2018in error\u2019 as above. John Amos himself talks about the poverty of (our) understanding later on, which is fantastic phrase and which should, surely, leave the door open for those of us who easily back away from what Ames himself calls the destructive potency of religious self-righteousness . Or perhaps I felt a bit removed from this because John Ames\u2019s musings, interesting though many of them are, lead to more musings, which are connected with new thoughts. There is rarely any action to speak of on which to pin some of these musings, and what conflict there is takes place in retrospect. A writer who was a firm Christian and whose works I enjoy without being able to follow him the whole nine (religious) yards is S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard who, I think, would have completely agreed with John Ames in the following: To be forgiven is only half the gift. The other half is that we also can forgive, restore and liberate, and therefore we can feel the will of God enacted through us, which is the great restoration of ourselves to ourselves. Yes, whether with or without the help of God, to become ourselves is perhaps ultimately what we/I do with each literary step we/I take. And to be sure, there is real warmth and intelligence in the book, which are what I\u2019ll take away with me: In the matter of belief, I have always found that defenses have the same irrelevance about them as the criticisms they are meant to answer. I think the attempt to defend belief can unsettle it, in fact, because there is always an inadequacy in argument about ultimate things. *Link to the conversation in The New York Review of Books: http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/... ...more There must be something wrong with me because this book did not engage me in the least but most of my Friends out there in GR, whom I deeply respect, loved it.

I have been a Buddhist for many years...over 10, though that absolves me of nothing, just makes me responsible to myself for the way I carry on my business. These days, that responsibility can be questioned. This entire book is written from the eyes of an aging minister as a letter or journal to his young son who he will not see grow up. It is a collection of his thoughts, of the history of his family that no one else would be able to tell. It is the most loving thing I have read in a long time. I have always admired religion in some way...not always agreed with the strictness of it or the seeming way it does not forgive those that don't believe, but I do know that there are kind hearted religious people out there that love and forgive because it is in their hearts. Because they somehow feel the Lord around them. This, whether you believe in God or not, is an enviable thing in life to have such a comfort for when times are not so good, or choices in life get questioned. This book is about finding some sort of peace with the life the man lived and relaying his hopes and dreams for his young son as he grows into a man. It is a testament to recognizing the faults in oneself and being able to stand in front of them and be accountable, even if they cannot be changed. I find myself here in this place right now. This place of accountability and though it is tough, I feel some sense of relief knowing I have placed a hand upon my heart, felt it beating in the truest manner in the choices I have made.

And of course that is exactly what he is. 'For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him?' In every important way we are such secrets from each other, and I do believe that there is a separate language in each of us, also a separate aesthetics and a separate jurisprudence. Every single one of us is a little civilization built on the ruins of any number of preceding civilizations, but with our own variant notions of what is beautiful and what is acceptable--which I hasten to add, we generally do not satisfy and by which we struggle to live. We take fortuitous resemblances among us to be actual likeness, because those around us have also fallen heir to the same customs, trade in the same coin, acknowledge, more or less, the same notions of decency and sanity. But all that really just allows us to coexist with the inviolable, untraversable, and utterly vast spaces between us.\" ...more What you have here is a 76 year old minister from Iowa, writing a journal, or long letter, to his 7 year old son.

Her narrator is a 77-year-old pastor in Gilead, Iowa, who's been told he has only a few months to live. That might sound depressing or boring, but from Robinson's pen, these pages flow with the intensity of a prayer, both anguished and assured. The whole novel is a letter, \"an experiment with candor,\" written by Rev. Ames to his 7-year-old son. Knowing he's \"about to put on imperishability,\" Ames writes, \"I'm trying to tell you things I might never have thought to tell you if I had brought you up myself, father and son, in the usual companionable way.\" The result is a testimony of struggle and faith over three generations that's more intimate and revealing than most parents can articulate in decades. Almost a quarter century has passed since the appearance of Robinson's previous novel, \"Housekeeping,\" which won the PEN/Faulkner Award for best first novel and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Since then she's published only nonfiction and taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. At this rate, she won't fill a long shelf, but with novels like this, grumbling would be ungrateful. \"Gilead\" wanders in that casual way that fellow masters of reflection like Henry David Thoreau or Annie Dillard manage without seeming vagrant. Ames's narrative is a mixture of wry commentary on the ministerial life, heartfelt reflections on God, and passing observations on what's happening that day. He makes a good effort to keep the preachy inflection out of his voice, but when it comes through, you can hear what fine guidance he must have given over the course of 2,250 sermons. He remarried late, after losing his first wife when he was young, and the decades of solitary service to his church were often lonely. Now, blessed with a child he never thought he'd have, the prospect of leaving his family behind for the glory beyond hits him squarely in the heart. But he continues on with his duties at church, feeling fine for the most part, meeting friends, watching his son, and knowing more intensely than ever the Lord's extravagance. \"One of the pleasures of these days,\" he writes, \"is that I notice them all, minute by minute.\" Ames admits that he's \"one of those righteous for whom the rejoicing in heaven will be comparatively restrained,\" but he recalls a store of wild anecdotes about his grandfather, a Union chaplain in the Civil War who saw visions of God frequently. The old one-eyed man was so militant that he signaled the start of church by firing his pistol. He rode with the abolition terrorist John Brown. He followed the Gospel so literally that he became a kleptomaniac in service to the poor. There's a touch of Louise Erdrich in these tragic-comic anecdotes. But the most profound moments arise from stories of spiritual intimacy with his own father, who was a preacher of a very different sort. Again and again, he returns to a trip they took on foot to find Grandfather's grave in Kansas during the devastating drought of 1892. Though just 12 at the time, Ames knew his father and grandfather had split over bitter disagreements about the value of war. The trip, he sensed, was his father's too late attempt to forgive and receive forgiveness from a man he loved but could never talk to openly. Ames won't make that mistake. The plot of \"Gilead\" - if the term \"plot\" can be used - involves the reappearance of his best friend's son, a ne'er-do-well named after him: John Ames Boughton. Ames never liked him as a boy, didn't even like him when he baptized him as an infant, and grew to despise him when he threw his friend's family into real crisis. Now, years later, Ames can't help noticing that this young man is about the same age as his own wife and that his son loves playing catch with him. He's worried and angry that Boughton seems to be making plans for the day when a spot opens up at his dining room table. And so, much of this letter is a conflicted effort to warn his son about the kind of man Boughton is, even while knowing that he should take a higher view of his namesake. \"Right worship is right perception,\" he reminds his son and himself, but \"it is hard for me to see the good faith in John Ames Boughton, and that's a terrible problem.\" Working out that problem is not easy. Boughton \"has considerable experience antagonizing people,\" and he seems to relish needling Ames with theological questions that put him on the defensive or make him feel evasive. If there's a blessing to be had from wrestling with this man, it's not quickly apparent to Ames. But in the extremity of his physical condition and familial worries, Ames discovers the sacraments in ordinary events and memories of daily life: watching the moon rise as the sun sets, taking bread from his dad's ash-covered hands, praying wholeheartedly for a man he's never really liked. There are passages here of such profound, hard-won wisdom and spiritual insight that they make your own life seem richer. \"A good sermon is one side of a passionate conversation,\" Ames notes, and so is a good book. There's something perhaps a little too sacred and private about this novel for the typical book-club kaffeeklatsch, but as we head into the holiday season, if it really is the thought that counts, I can't imagine a better gift than this one. Speaking of the material world he's about to leave behind, Ames advises his son, \"This is an interesting planet. It deserves all the attention you can give it.\" The same can be said for \"Gilead,\" a quiet, deep celebration of life that you must not miss. http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1130/p1... ...more Faith gets such a bad rap these days. The most egregiously distorted personifications of it stand as paragons: Sarah Palin's hypocritical, dangerous and politicized evangelism; Pat Robertson's venomous, hateful, racist diatribes.

The Palins and Robertsons of the world--and their brand of religious belief and practice--are easily dismissed because the presentation of it Faith gets such a bad rap these days. The most egregiously distorted personifications of it stand as paragons: Sarah Palin's hypocritical, dangerous and politicized evangelism; Pat Robertson's venomous, hateful, racist diatribes. Et cetera. At the foundation of these demonstrations of faith is a lack of any kind of sensible, coherent, thought-through logic. The Palins and Robertsons of the world--and their brand of religious belief and practice--are easily dismissed because the presentation of it is nonsensical to the point of psychosis. They require, on the part of their followers, the complete turning-off of that part of the brain that questions and evaluates. The thinking part of the brain. As a result, thinking comes to be antithetical to Christian belief or any kind of extremist religious belief. This is not right. I am open-minded enough to know that, even though I don't share it and can't share it, there are many people whose faith is well-founded on a belief system that has been examined, scrutinized, sometimes (often) struggled with. A belief system that includes doubt and fallibility; and also compassion and tolerance for those who don't share it. This is why it's faith, because it includes--not precludes--doubt and questioning. John Ames, Marilynne Robinson's creation in Gilead , is the latter type of believer, a person of faith which does not preclude either doubt or intellect. In reading this character's thoughts, my eyes were opened again to that kind of believer, one for whom I have ultimate respect. I can't share his world-view, but I can respect it, and here, I can even enjoy it--the beautiful, lyrical, literary examination and presentation of faith. I've now said more than I wanted to about this book, because this review captures almost precisely my response to it, and far more eloquently than I have so far. (thank you, brian) Some other things I enjoyed, all of them very subtle: 1) the wry, sneak-up on you humour (very unexpected, but welcome); 2) the imagery of the 'hereafter' -- envisioned as a third dimension, unknowable and indescribable; 3) the presentation of aging (in this, Ames reminds me of Hagar in Laurence's The Stone Angel --another gorgeously evocative depiction of the aging mind); 4) of course, the character and symbolism of \"Jack\"--what he represents to John Ames, the doubt and struggle with his own faith and adherence to faith-based behaviour that Ames ultimately manages to integrate into his own belief system, and with whom he reconciles, both on a physical 'in-the-world' level as well as a spiritual one. ...more", "Title": "Gilead"},
