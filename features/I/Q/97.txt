If I did, that would certainly narrow the number of films I\u2019d see. No, I go to be entertained (whatever that may mean on any particular day). That\u2019s the way I look at the books I read, particularly fiction, and I think Dan Brown\u2019s books are very entertaining.<---F> They are a fictional escape</---F>. We\u2019ve all seen the stats that show how few books Americans are reading these days (present company excluded) and I think these types of books are an excellent way to get the masses to pick up, read, listen and get back involved in books. That\u2019s what it is all about\u2026like starting children with books from an early age, once they\u2019re in, who knows where it can lead them. I want more of my friends to read books and if this is the hook, then I\u2019m happy to bait it and reel them in. My personal opinion of the Lost Key Symbol was that I liked it, but after reading all his other books I found this one more predictable. Still it was entertaining and I recommend it. I think many others will enjoy it as well. ...more I have such issues rating Dan Brown books... I want 1.5 stars, I think. Snark ahead. Here's the deal: the man can't write. He's a name-brand & url spewing, Wikipedia-like fountain of knowledge, who CAN'T HANDLE VERB TENSES. He also likes really short sentences. That aren't sentences at all. Really.

On the flip side, who doesn't love a good romp around a famous city solving mysteries with art and science and religion? You know the drill, and the formula hasn't changed here in the slightest. As a former DC resident of 7 years, I have to admit, I was expecting slightly more from the location, but Langdon and his companion du jour keep getting trapped in random places, so it's a bit disappointing on that front. He does get 10 points for a hilarious caper including the Blue Line out to the King Street station though and the Red Line to Tenleytown (yeah, Tenleytown shout-out, what up!) This book's wacky science theme is Noetics, and the quasi-religious thing at hand is the Masons. Since the first thing that comes to mind re: Noetics is Fringe, I sort of expected a Pacey Witter guest appearance, but alas, it was not meant to be. I know absolutely zip about the Masons, but who wants to bet their membership applications go through the roof this month? So my final verdict: did I hate it as much as Catcher in the Rye? No. (Will I ever hate any book as much as I hate Catcher in the Rye? Unlikely. BUT THERE'S TIME.) Is it the best <---C>Robert Langdon</---C> book? Not by a long shot. Angels & Demons still is the best of the trilogy. Is it still vaguely enjoyable in the way only a Dan Brown book can be? Yes. Does Dan Brown's copy editor need to be publicly humiliated? YES AND HIS NAME IS APPARENTLY JASON KAUFMAN (according to the Acknowledgements, so I'm not like, stalking anyone here) AND GOOD LORD MAN, ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES CAUSED BY PEOPLE BURNING THIS BOOK EDIT THIS INTO SOMETHING ENJOYABLE. EVERY TIME DAN BROWN DOESN'T KNOW HOW A VERB WORKS, KITTENS DIE. Also, if I ever have to read the words \"neutered sex organ\" again, I will be forced to remove my eyeballs and then pour bleach directly onto my brain. One more P.S., since I tweeted this and then forgot to include this here: Most unbelievable part of the plot? The Redskins are in the playoffs AND score on their opening possession. PLEASE TRY AGAIN, YOU FAIL AT HAVING SPORTS KNOWLEDGE. ...more This book is both poorly written and impossible to put down. I think that about sums it up. I liked Angels and Demons and I really liked The DaVinci Code but this latest of Dan Browns thrillers was barely worth the time, and definitely not worth the money. <+++>The Lost Symbol</+++> follows the familiar Dan Brown formula - an ominous conspiracy, a threat to end the world as we know it, a relentless villain, and a search for hidden secrets which require the decoding of obscure clues.

This formula has given us a couple of fine thrillers, and has taken advantage of the authors familiarity with arcane history, philology, symbolism, art and architecture. But even this intriguing texture would not be terribly interesting without the intrepid symbologist Robert Langdon to lead us through the perilous labyrinth at high speed. This time, Langdon must find the Freemason\u2019s grand secret hidden in Washington, D.C. and evade both the CIA and a brilliant but scary villain, while rescuing a kidnapped friend and his sister. The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons were both intriguing and thrilling enough to overcome Mr. Brown's weak writing. But because The Lost Symbol\u2019s plot is so much weaker, Brown\u2019s sophomoric writing becomes much more obvious and ever more bothersome as the work progresses. For example, the formulaic mini-cliffhangers at the end of nearly every chapter became trite and annoying manipulations. Brown also employed several set-pieces of lecture and discovery that annoyingly repeat themselves. This book is full of Brownian cliches. I think that the credibility of this work is further undermined by using characters who are simultaneously brilliant and clueless. For instance, the intrepid and brilliant professor Langdon, who by now should be rather wary of mysterious invitations, flies to Washington D.C. at a moment's notice supposedly at a friend's request but without actually speaking to his friend. And even less credible, is that without direct confirmation, he brings with him a top-secret package that he swore to keep hidden at all costs. Similarly, the brilliant scientist Katherine doesn\u2019t think to back up her life\u2019s work of scientific research, and she allows a man she's met only once into her \"top secret\" laboratory because she receives a TEXT message purportedly from her brother who she admits doesn\u2019t even know how to text. And these are not the only naive, and clueless people who should know better. The police and security guards are all hapless,and even the CIA director fails to question whether a suspect is lying when he says \"I'll be there in 20 minutes.\" More disappointing still is that the main character of Robert Langdon seems to have been dumbed down in this book. He repeatedly is adamant about thus and such only to be subsequently shocked when the true meaning is revealed. He always requires two attempts to decipher the true meaning of clues - the first one which is obvious and turns out to be wrong, followed by the shocking epiphany. One would think that a Harvard professor would eventually learn that things are not always what they seem. In this work Robert Langdon spends more time being lectured than he does solving mysteries or puzzles. My recollection is that he figured out absolutely nothing critical in the last third of the book. Even more troubling than Brown\u2019s weak and cliched characterization is that as the thriller reaches its climax, it becomes clear that the pieces do not fit together well. For instance, for most of the story, both the villain, and the CIA insist the stakes couldn't be higher, but in the end we learn that the potential danger is merely some bad public relations for a few powerful Masons. Why then is the CIA involved in this extortion plot - especially since it is legally barred from domestic law enforcement? The author simply fails to provide justification for all the black opps of the CIA counter- conspiracy despite their central role in the story. There are lots of problems with this book, but perhaps the its greatest flaw is Dan Brown\u2019s failure to ever explain the main premise for the book, something he calls the Ancient Mysteries. The primary force that propels the plot is the implicit promise that in the end, a tangible secret will be uncovered. While the protagonist keeps asking if this grand secret is merely metaphorical, he is assured by friends, enemies and even the CIA that the secret is literal and potentially dangerous. But, in the end we learn that the grand secret for which people are willing to sacrifice their lives and fortunes doesn\u2019t really exist. What exactly is the point of the pyramid and the secret codes and symbols if the grand mystery is already found in every church, in nearly every home, and in even in all the hotel rooms in the country? Doesn't that make the entire plot pointless to begin with? OK, if it\u2019s not clear yet, HERE IS THE BIG SPOILER: The great Masonic secret is the most widely published and read book in history - it is the Bible. Brown\u2019s thesis is that the Bible is loaded with hidden wisdom, and once these biblical secrets are pointed out, people are going to be shocked that they didn't see them before. And then they are going to be transformed because they now know that they're one with God, or they're the same as God, or they are made of God, or some such new age mumbo-jumbo. So in the end the whole purpose of all the elaborate secrecy is that a few people think mankind may not be ready for a new age when human potential will be finally unleashed. So for centuries the inner circle of Masons have concocted elaborate means to hide this enlightenment from a world not ready for apotheosis. And so despite all the symbols and codes, the grand secret is really kept hidden in plain sight. So pay no attention to the coded mysteries behind the curtain. The ending of this story is an embarrassment. It may be the most anti-climactic, unsatisfying ending I have ever read. While the story kept claiming that earth shattering secrets were soon to be revealed, in the end all the paintings, pyramids, talismans, and other clues turned out to lead to nothing. They resolved nothing, they didn\u2019t even leave us with a mystery yet unsolved. The mystery was solved, and it was an inconsequential whimper instead of a revelatory bang. It is my opinion that the author could not pull together the novel in the last chapters simply because there was nothing to pull together. There was no sweeping statement to be made and no grand secret to be revealed. This left me very unsatisfied at the story\u2019s end. Theological addendum: Many Christians are offended by the idea of apotheosis which seems to be a core premise of Brown\u2019s Masonic heroes. Though the idea of human deification has a long and ancient history in Christian thought, these critics have disowned the notion that Man can become like God, and consequently are offended when Brown places this mystery at the apex of his new-age amalgam of Masonry, religion and pseudo-science. As a Latter-day Saint (Mormon), I believe that having been literally created in God\u2019s image, we each have the innate potential to become glorified and exalted through obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My belief that man can become like god, is akin to the belief of Christian writers through the ages from Irenaus to C.S. Lewis. So deification doesn\u2019t offend me at all. Ironically, however, I find myself in strong agreement with Christian critics who accuse Brown of idolatry for claiming that this apotheosis can occur merely through our own mystical consciousness raising efforts. The central message of the Bible, and most especially the New Testament is that such a dramatic transformation can only occur on God\u2019s terms and by means of his power and grace. In contrast, Brown attempts to \u201cspiritualize\u201d or metaphorize all particularity and literal meaning out of the biblical text. To Brown\u2019s heroes, the real meaning of the text is whatever the true mystic wants to find hidden within. His new-age hodge podge of religion is very convenient,non-demanding, self-asserting and self-serving. It is the opposite of God\u2019s revealed truth which requires self-less obedience and devotion to God and our fellow men. The Bible\u2019s central message of obedience and faith is not found in Brown\u2019s mystical amalgam, nor in any other brand of humanism. Brown ironically attempts to bolster his view of an impersonal God and a godless salvation by selectively quoting the Bible, a book which persistently and powerfully testifies of a personal God - a Father in Heaven who knows us individually, and cares about helping us overcome our sins more than developing our mental, or psycho-kinetic capacities. I agree with those critics who claim that the God described, or implied by Brown is an idolatrous invention of man as surely as that of Odin, Zeus, Baal, or the God of the Greek philosophers whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. In my view, Brown\u2019s mishmash of new age nonsense intending to avoid dogma and doctrine, has very little point except to highlight that humans have enormous untapped potential. I don\u2019t see anything revealing or revolutionary about this truism. I cannot conceive of such a benign observation creating any paradigm shift, nor can I imagine it unleashing pent-up human capacity. On the contrary, I think it is mankind\u2019s persistent attempts to ignore the substantive teachings of the Bible that have bound us to telestial mediocrity. Even so, I suspect this theological critique is probably a bit over-the-top when you consider that this book is just a work of adventure fantasy. The Lost Symbol ought not to be taken too seriously. I don\u2019t imagine that it will shape many people\u2019s views of God, the Bible, or even religion in general. I don\u2019t see The Lost symbol as much of a threat to my sacred beliefs, even though I thought I might as well throw in my two bits on the matter. ...more \"\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0634

thought I'd abandon the book after just 10 pages only ...The ritual..The most powerful brotherhood ever..the future traitor -as we know from his thoughts-.. and his -almost- death that made me gasp. This events that take place in the House of the Temple is what made me abandon the book. It's only 20 days till Ramadan, which is a dead line for me to finish all the novels and just read the holy book. I don't think with the work,upcoming Revolution and next weekend trip to the IMAX for Superman new movie will finish this HUGE book with what's seem -for me- more interesting plot- at least didn't saw its movie yet :)-So I don't want to get hasty finishing it..It must be read very well and perfectly.. The reason I start it late is a bit stupid..I waited to buy another illustrated edition ,The UK one as the ones I got for the other 2...Although I bought the US ones later even the Lost Symbol..But I guess it's my stupid Book Collecting Addiction :) and it's just arrived yesterday So till Aug.... :( **************************************** 21 April :The Lost Symbol Illustrated Edition finally here directly from Amazon..The US Edition [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I really enjoy Dan Brown's stories. I have read Angels and Demon and The Da Vinci Code, I am currently reading Deception Point and plan on reading Digitial Fortress. I absolutely love his story telling. I have read mixed reviews and I think the negative reviews are just really people who are too serious in life. For goodness sake it is a book for entertainment, not a non-fiction story.

Though I have read some non-fiction stories that are more fiction then Dan Brown's book. Brown's books are entertaining and make you look at thing in different ways which is good. Everytime I pick up Brown's book, I am totally immersed in the story and at the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next. I can't wait until the next book. It took me a bit longer to finish this book then I expected, but I am so glad that I read it. Again, Dan Brown delivers a thought provoking story in his unique style. I know others really dislike Brown's style of writing saying that it follows a formula of the ultra dramatic and the never ending cliff hanger chapters, but I just don't tire of that at all. A great thrilling read. I can't wait to read the next Dan Brown book! ...more I liked this novel actually better than DV Code and A & D, which is ironic as it wasn't quite the page turner as those were, but the plot and ideas were more believeable. I was very interested in The Masons, as they were so much a part of the early patriotic/revolutionary era of the US. As usual there is a gruesome evil person, with superhuman like skills and power. The whole story covers just 24 hours...wow, what a day!

The whole story covers just 24 hours...wow, what a day! Interesting insight from Brown on the Masons or Noetic Science?: \"a temple of God\" refers to the \"temple\" of the brain; how \"the created,...becomes the Creator\"; when the eye is single, your body fills with light\". For me the last part of the book added to my personal confirmation of what faith is, and that \"our minds can generate energy capable of transforming physical matter.\" I believe as Katherine stated, \"As soon as we humans begin to harness our true power, we will have enormous control over our world..and be able to design reality, rather than merely react to it.\" How about this idea: God created us in his image, but not just our physical bodies resemble him, but our minds! Now that's a a great idea, and correlates with my LDS belief that we were all intelligences first, even before our spirits were created. Because of this, we have God-like potential power, and indeed can become like him. We just haven't learned all that is necessary ...yet. Interestingly, he refers to the Hebrew meaning of God, Elohim, which is plural. Hmmm, gives lots to think about, especially if you don't believe in God, or if your belief in God is limited. Love this idea also on p. 563, There are those who create, and those who tear down. The dynamic has existed for all time. Another perspective of atonement....\"gathering what is scattered...to bring order from chaos, to find \"at-one-ment\", from this vantage point, His characters discuss the inherent power of prayer groups, healing circles, singing in unison, worshipping en mass... unfortunately, no mention of Christ in that view, but there is still much truth there. \"We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.\" Can you believe a popular fiction novel promoting such eternal truths? I'd love to talk to others about this, but my husband disliked the book. I thought it was great. ...more Now boarding on track 33, the Symbolism Express departing for the Freemasons, the Invisible College, the Office of Security, the SMSC, the Institute of Noetic Sciences and multiple points around the cryptic compass.

Your temporal destination, not Paris and London, but Washington, D.C. Your conductor, Harvard symbiologist Robert Langdon, the Indiana Jones of the new age. Tied to the tracks in the gathering darkness ahead and facing certain death, if not embarrassment, another keeper of the ancient mysteries including the wisdom of Solomon, not a man of the Louvre, but a man of the Smithsonian. Traveling alone, an attractive female relative of the man lashed to the tracks, not agent and cryptologist Sophie Neveu, but Noetic scientist Dr Katherine Solomon. Sitting in the engineer's seat with a small stone pyramid rather than a chalice holding down the deadman's pedal, a rogue and tattooed Mason in search of apotheosis replaces Silas, \"The Da Vinci Code's\" rogue and scourged monk as our antagonist for the evening. Hold on. It's going to be another bumpy ride. Dreams of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu remind you what the journey will be like: short chapters, multiple points of view, conflicting agendas with something very large (yet unknown) at stake, the thrill of the chase, the almost-sexual tension of near-satisfaction again and again as answers appear and disappear, multiple station stops for arcane wisdom instruction, and a desperate-save-humanity-hunt for secrets you've stared at your entire life without comprehending. By the end of the novel, you won't be a 33rd Degree Mason and you won't be like unto a god in any way you can quite wrap your mind around, but you will have experienced a high-adrenaline ride. This thrill is what the journey is all about. Perhaps reality lurks around the edge of the plot and theme and perhaps sacred messages lurk within the vast white spaces between the lines of black type, but that's not why we're turning the pages from 1 to 509. Dan Brown has done it again, and upon reflection at the dawn's first light, you'll see that he knows how to pull the right strings and push the right buttons and sprinkle the right esoteric seasonings across his smorgasbord of mysteries from around the world to keep readers addicted for the trip. On the last page, you may well hope, along with Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon that men and women will follow the ancient maps toward their true potential; but seriously, the novel's destination really doesn't matter, does it, because the ride was the peak experience you were seeking when you picked up \"The Lost Symbol.\" All aboard. ...more \u0627\u0647\u0646\u064a\u0621

He writes very average thriller/ mystery books, just like many others do, and the thing is that I don't have a problem with the other writers. Sometimes their books are entertaining, sometimes they are not, sometimes they are poorly written, sometimes they are not so bad, and I'm perfectly fine with it. The thing I can't stand about Dan Brown is his attitude. He truly believes he has been invested with the power of 'omniscience', and he looks d I think I finally figured out why I hate Dan Brown.

The thing I can't stand about Dan Brown is his attitude. He truly believes he has been invested with the power of 'omniscience', and he looks down at the reader as if he were talking to a bunch of retarded individuals (which we actually probably are just by virtue of the fact that we are reading his books). But this is still ok, it doesn't upset me all that much. What I think is unacceptable is the fact that in his 'all encompassing knowledge', all we find is an endless bunch of lies, lies about the most obvious evidence anybody can prove. Angels and Demons, which takes place in Rome, is filled with sentences in Italian, except that Mr. Brown didn't even bother looking up the spelling of the words and, as if that were not enough, he invented words to look cool in the eyes of his readers which, come on, wouldn't be able to pick all the bull I'm trying to sell them in a million years! In the Italian version of The Lost Symbol, I noticed that the translators skipped more than one passage because what DB had written not only wasn't accurate, it was blatantly WRONG! So, I don't know if they didn't want to look stupid themselves or did it to try and give Mr. Brown a better image abroad. Just one tiny detail out of many: Classical Greek 101 - Apo is a preposition, with different meanings but still and only a preposition, for sure not a verb. No!!! not in the Lost Key. Dan Brown has to show us he knows the ethimology of the word apotheosis, and so Apo, for him, turns into a verb, and he lectures us as if he were revealing this great truth. I read on a review that his books are an insult to human intelligence. I agree, and not because they are necessarily awful books, but because taking reality and twisting it so that it can fit the story line and, on top of that, selling it as if it were some kind or revelation we can only obtain through Dan Brown's grace, to me is unacceptable. ...more When one picks up a Dan Brown book there are certain expectations. First one can look forward to a fast-based adventure pitting the intellect of Robert Langdon against dark forces intent on creating mayhem of one sort or another. One expects that religion or religious institutions will play a central role in the story. One can expect that there will be puzzles to be solved and mysteries within mysteries. One can expect murderous sociopaths and police of questionable loyalty. One can expect that When one picks up a Dan Brown book there are certain expectations.

One can expect murderous sociopaths and police of questionable loyalty. One can expect that there will be a considerable quantity of payload in the form of interesting, arcane information. One can expect that once begun it will be a difficult book to put down. And Brown delivers on all of the above. If you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere. That is not Brown\u2019s beat. Be prepared for some eye-rolling, as hyper-intelligent people make glaringly stupid decisions, all in the service of moving the plot along. And there are some notions at the end of the book that may be a bit much to swallow. But it is all in fun. It is what it is. Enjoy. A few other DBs for your consideration ----- Angels & Demons ----- The Da Vinci Code ----- Inferno ...more I'm a fan of Dan Brown. I've read all his books - not just The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons , but also Deception Point and Digital Fortress . I like his writing style, how his books are layered with codes and mysteries, and how they're so fast-paced they make my heart beat faster because I feel pulled into the stories and into the lives of his characters.

I like his writing style, how his books are layered with codes and mysteries, and how they're so fast-paced they make my heart beat faster because I feel pulled into the stories and into the lives of his characters. The Lost Symbol is the third book in the Robert Langdon series, and I was glad to see that Brown brought this dynamic and entertaining character back to the United States from Europe and the UK in his previous books. The book starts with a bang, pulling me in within the first few paragraphs, though I didn't feel quite as captivated by this story as I had with his previous two. As with numbers 1 and 2 in the series, there's a format to the story: Robert Langdon, Harvard professor and expert on symbology and religious iconography find himself embroiled in the middle of a high-stakes religious mystery, where a long-debated and highly protected secret is on the verge of being exposed to the masses and ruined for those who have long stood to protect it. There is, of course, the supporting female character, a smart and capable woman who helps fill in the gaps where Langdon's knowledge leaves off. As was true to the past two books, there is physical and emotional danger, as well as a deranged villain who is at once brilliant, physically superior, and acting in what he believes to be the best interest of the world. Despite the true-to-form shape of this book, though, it stands well on its own as a book. Although I enjoyed the reading of this book from beginning to end, it wasn't until the final chapters that I felt a strong connection with it, and that is because the view of religion that Brown describes here - as in both of his previous books in the series - falls directly in line with my own personal beliefs of religion and the concept of God. Readers who criticized his previous explanations of such topics will likely find much to refute and criticize here as well, but for me it's like a breath of fresh air, to know that I'm not the only one who sees the universe in greater terms than just a church and its congregants. This was an entertaining read, as always, and I'm glad to add it to my collections with his other works. I'm sure I'll enjoy reading this particular book more in the future. ...more Ugghhhhhh. I've been trying to figure out where to start with this one for the past couple days and still haven't been able to decide. So I guess I'll start with my point. This book F*CKING BLOWS. F*ck you, Dan Brown, you smug bastard, for insulting my intelligence like nobody's business. I really liked Angels and Demons, was entertained by The Da Vinci Code, and this book had half the content (not to mention a sixteenth of the climax) of the latter in almost twice the number of pages.

I really liked Angels and Demons, was entertained by The Da Vinci Code, and this book had half the content (not to mention a sixteenth of the climax) of the latter in almost twice the number of pages. Do you get paid by the modifier? Or the number of hits of the term \"secret wisdom\"? BUY A GODDAMN THESAURUS. LEARN SOME NEW F*CKING VERBS. Do you ever get sick of writing the following dialogue? \"But that can't possibly be true!\" \"Why not Robert?\" \"My sharp intellect and well-toned physique just won't let me believe it!\" Seriously, every other f*cking chapter has that conversation, but with way more modifiers and whining, not to mention that it usually takes up a whole f*cking page. And the shit of it is, it's not even f*cking suspenseful. He literally just keeps you waiting. He doesn't even hide it anymore. The f*cker knows you're going to keep reading anyway, so why even bother to be creative with the cliffhangers? And the puzzles are even straightforward! Even though I don't hold a degree in Symbollogy (Yeah f*cking right. I still contend that he made that word up. Watch the f*cking Boondock Saints, Dan Brown.), a handful of them are completely obvious, and I swear he recycled at least one from Angels and Demons. And only one revelation in the whole book is remotely shocking. And I did see it coming. The rest of them are just inane letdowns. When I hear, \"issue of national security,\" I think nukes-- not the pussy shit this guy is threatening. Deep breath. Moral of the story, please don't feed the author. And moral number two: if the back cover of a book contains solely \"Critical Raves for Another Book,\" I should know better. ...more This is the first book by Dan Brown that I have ever read. I remember that it took me only a couple of days to finish it, mainly because I find Dan's writing style so clean and easy to read; sometimes it felt like I was watching the story unfold before my eyes instead of reading it. The Lost Symbol provides a very good story with consistent and believable characters.

The Lost Symbol provides a very good story with consistent and believable characters. Even though there are people that say that Dan's books do not make sense sometimes, I find that they make sense enough for a book which's aim is to entertain other than inform or educate. The pleasure of seeing Langdon solving mysteries again, using nothing more than his intelligence, was enough for me to keep reading. In all honesty, when I want to learn actual historical facts or complex concepts of physics, I will go and buy a technical book, not a novel. The story revolves around complex topics as quantum physics, life after death, the existence of the human soul, not-so-orthodox religions and karma. However, all these are consistently connected with one another thus making the central story line cohesive and easy to read. If you're not one of those ultra boring people which infest the world nowadays, you might find thrilling and even fun to accompany Langdon as he tries desperately to stop a narcissistic psychopath from killing what remains of his own family in search of what he thinks will finally make him perfect. I sure did. Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: Great minds are always feared by lesser minds. To live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books. The only difference between you and God is that you have forgotten you are divine. ...more I am so disappointed. I found Brown's other books to be captivating, if a little formulaic. This is just a blatant rewrite of his own material in a different setting. Angels and Demons set a bar for Brown, and he just hasn't been able to match it since.

When I started wandering off in search of snacks in the middle of paragraphs, I knew it was time to shelve this as a \"can't finish,\" and move on. Though technically better written than Digital Fortress, this is Dan Brown's worst novel. Brown creates false suspense by hiding revelations from readers even after major characters learn them. In most cases this is unnecessary, as the twists would have more impact if made in a timely manner.

Too often, however, the revelations are obvious or anticlimactic, weaknesses that are amplified by Brown's hide-the-ball technique. Brown's penchant for dubious subject matter is well-known, but he previously managed to pull out decent stories from hokum like the Illuminati and the holy blood/holy grail theory. Here he sidesteps the expected Masonic conspiracy theories, instead casting Robert Langdon as Mason apologist. No, Brown's meat here is Noetic Science, a field that in real life has the credibility of a cable TV huckster/mystic. Even after the plot wraps, Brown drones on for several more chapters about mysticism and religion, with no apparent purpose but to lecture you, dear reader, for having the gall to trust science and technology. As for Brown's style, phrases like \"soggy marsh\" make it clear he still hasn't picked up a copy of The Elements of Style. Much like Brown's villain, I need a cleansing ritual of my own after reading this book. ...more Normally I wait until I\u2019ve finished a book before passing judgment on it, but sixty pages into The Lost Symbol I decided that life was too short to read really terrible books. One of the things I liked best about The Da Vinci Code was that its plot unfolded in real-time: it takes place during a few very busy hours of Robert Langdon\u2019s improbable life, in about the amount of time it takes to read the novel. This technique keeps the pace of the book exciting (there are no natural breaks in which to Normally I wait until I\u2019ve finished a book before passing judgment on it, but sixty pages into The Lost Symbol I decided that life was too short to read really terrible books. One of the things I liked best about The Da Vinci Code was that its plot unfolded in real-time: it takes place during a few very busy hours of Robert Langdon\u2019s improbable life, in about the amount of time it takes to read the novel. This technique keeps the pace of the book exciting (there are no natural breaks in which to put the book down, because you are right there with Langdon for each plot development and puzzle solution), but also demonstrates the kind of discipline on the part of the author also shown in a really well-rhymed sonnet that commands the respect of the (or, at least, this) reader. This is the novelistic equivalent of Scribe\u2019s well-made play (a cinematic example would be the film Arsenic and Old Lace with Cary Grant, one of my favorites). The Lost Symbol , however, is anything but disciplined. The point of view, time, and place bounce around every one or two minutes, evincing not the well-put-together thriller of The Da Vinci Code , but rather the attention span of a three-year-old. Each scene lasts about as long as a television commercial, and juxtaposed scenes have about as much connecting them as two adjacent television commercials. Another piece of sloppiness: during my brief encounter with the novel, I encountered the phrase \u201cexact same\u201d five times. A good friend of mine used to be in the habit of correcting anyone who dared to let that phrase pass his or her lips (because, after all, if two things really are the same, then the word \u201cexact\u201d is superfluous, not to mention grammatically suspect), so while I will tolerate the phrase as a spoken colloquialism, my feeling is now that only the most careless of writers would ever commit such a phrase to print. With all the doors that must be open for Dan Brown after the phenomenal success of The Da Vinci Code , how difficult could it have been for him to sit in on a lecture of a popular course at a prestigious liberal arts college? I only wonder because no college course I have ever attended proceeded anything like the one shown in one of the many (many, many) flashbacks early in the book (although, admittedly, I did not go to Harvard, but I suspect the students there would not be so easily impressed by something as shocking as (gasp!) pointing out that the Church has rituals of its own. I mean, come on, these kids are taking a course called \u201cOccult Symbols\u201d: what did they expect?) So I have no doubt that, if I had read the book in its entirety, everything would turn out to be not as it seemed in a shocking plot twist near the end, but, really, there are too many good books out there for me to waste my time on this one. ...more \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0647 \u0623\u064a\u0636\u064b\u0627\u060c \u0641\u064a

However, due to the nature of search engines, etc., I don't want to spoil things off the back. So I'll start off with a few non-spoilery things just for padding. Everything I say is based on the fact My Spoiler-Heavy and Sympathy-Free Review of \"The Lost Symbol\" by Dan Brown This review is going to be riddled with spoilers, to the point where I'm actually going to tell you everything that happens (in summary), because that's the only way I can express my complete and utter contempt for this book. However, due to the nature of search engines, etc., I don't want to spoil things off the back. So I'll start off with a few non-spoilery things just for padding. Everything I say is based on the fact that there are two books in The Lost Symbol; the first book is the DaVinci Code with find/replace done. The second book is a philosophy book, and that's the real source of my vitriol. You'll understand why when I start spewing, well, vitriol at it. Before I begin, I would like to point out that Dan Brown believes in the Myth of the Flat Earth (see Wiki). There's a quote from one of the main characters that \"Peter once compared Noetic Scientists to the early explorers who were mocked for embracing the heretical notion of a spherical earth. Almost overnight, these explorers went from fools to heroes, discovering uncharted worlds and expanding the horizons of everyone on the planet.\" (Keep in mind who's being cited in the paragraph) The fact that Brown believes this myth seriously undermines his credibility. How can we trust someone on esoteric matters when they're wrong on mundane matters? I also want to state for the record that I sorta enjoyed DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons. I felt the latter was better (although the ending was ridiculous), but overall they weren't bad reads. To put it a different way: neither of them resulted in a review like this. Ok, one last thing before I start spoiling things completely. If you're interested in an alternative Mason experience, I recommend either reading Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum -- which, to be honest, is a tough book to read. The secret seems to be not trying to figure out everything that's going on; if it's important he'll come back to it -- or watching the delightful Nicolas Cage history/conspiracy romp National Treasure if you only have a couple hours. Ok, enough prattle. Spoilers ahead. ... There's a Bible buried in the cornerstone of the Washington Monument, and Robert Langdon needs to stop a madman from tattooing it to his head and uploading a video to YouTube! I'm not kidding. That's the first part of the book. And there was actually a moment where I was seriously contemplating giving the book 4 stars. Yes, it was almost an exact replica of the DaVinci Code. But it's better written and less didactic (until the the second part). You still have the same contrivances of style that make it deliberately confusing who is doing something because of course there has to be a \"mole\" character (although not as obnoxious this time). And frankly the factual information is interesting and not anti-Catholic like the other two books in the series. You can still foresee plot points relatively easily (I'll get to the important one in a second), and you're going to get the same group of individuals who think some of the fake stuff (essentially everything the female character has done as a \"noetic scientist\") is true because of the real stuff the book contains just like they thought the DaVinci Code was true. But I believe I would've given the book 3 stars if it had ended at the top floor of the masonic temple. Sadly, it didn't, and that's also where the wheels fall off. So I take you to the climax of the story, and the spoilers are really going to fly fast here. The madman has taken Peter Solomon (the head of the Masons, essentially) to the top of the temple -- and has revealed himself to be the son long thought dead! Of course, everyone probably figured this out about 200 pages earlier (sometimes the ambiguous writing of Brown is a giant flashing sign saying \"Things aren't what they seem!\"), but that's not a problem. And he wants to tattoo the \"word\" to his head, but his father gives him the wrong word (of course, since it's not a literal word, it's the aforementioned bible in the Washington Monument). And then his father refuses to kill his son (with the knife Abraham was going to use to kill Isaac!) to complete his mad dream of ascension into divinity, although we're not told if an angel tells him not to. But he gets killed anyway when the glass above the altar is shattered by a helicopter, a perfect symbol of the novel completely falling apart, because now things get weird. The son he thought dead is now dying on an altar, so what does the father say to him as he lies there? \"I lied to you about the tattoo on your head. Oh and uh, yeah, I never stopped loving you.\" Seriously. It's like his body was possessed by Nelson (the bully, not the admiral) for a moment and he said \"Ha Ha!\". And then his son goes to hell. Seriously. There's a paragraph where we're in the mind of his son as he dies and I'm pretty damn certain what Brown was hinting at was Hell. (But hey, that's ok, the science of noetics has already \"proven\" in the book that the soul has weight. Seriously). Even though I was starting to cringe, I probably would've still given it a 3rd star (there's precedence: Angels and Demons got 3 stars from me even though I cringed through most of the end). But then Peter Solomon -- who, I might add, was just tortured, had his hand cut off, and watched his son who he thought was dead die -- decides that now is the perfect time to have an \"argument\" (from the Greek meaning \"I meant you to say Arrgghh\") with Robert Langdon as they go to the Washington Monument (the pyramid! the spiral staircase!). And Peter's argument is this: God is in us, we're all primed for enlightenment, the secret is in the bible (and other religious texts), we just can't read it correctly yet (look for sales of the Bible Code to spike). And here is where Dan Brown did what made me so angry. He made Langdon the unrepentant skeptic. This is a few hundred pages after Langdon (in a flashback) told his students to open their minds. Now this is typical Brown anyway: Langdon has been forced to hold the idiot stick many, many times in the three books simply for plot contrivances. At first I thought that's what he was doing here, and if he had let well enough alone I'd probably wouldn't be writing this. But the \"argument\" goes on for over 50 pages. In other words, Langdon isn't holding the idiot stick; Brown is putting the idiot stick in our hands and is beating us with it. It's not Langdon that Solomon is trying to convince. It's the reader that Brown is trying to convince. Why either Langdon or the reader should trust someone who believes that people thought the earth was flat in the middle ages is not answered. And here's the fun part: I actually agree with some of the philosophy that Brown is espousing here. But I strongly disagree with is manipulation. And there is no other word for what Brown is trying to do here. Langdon's skepticism takes a long time to be overcome, but in the end, it is overcome. Brown makes sure of that. By proxy, our own skepticism should be overcome -- we've been beaten with the idiot stick long enough we're screaming \"Yes! Yes! I believe! Just end the book already!\" It's crass, it's underhanded, and it's pathetic. It's not that I expected better from Dan Brown, it's that I didn't expect it at all. He knew he'd never have an opportunity to reach a larger audience, and unwilling or incapable of subtletly he wrote a book designed to hit you with made-up facts to support a made-up philosophy. I can not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone. If you've already read it, I'm sorry.

The whole Freemasons storyline was done so much better in National Treasure (which I'm now watching in an effort to cleanse myself of this book). Okay, fine. We'll go slightly in-depth with our characters for a moment. WHY DID NO ONE CARE ABOUT TRISH?? That pissed me off. Katherine asked about her a few times and then there was no mention of her ever again, poor thing. Nice of you to pretend to care, Katherine. And speaking of pretending to care, I was astounded that Peter could give Langdon a tour of DC and be so coherent after the rediscovery and second loss of his son. Prior that... I dunno, I always think that parents have a sixth sense about their kids. That in mind, I found it extremely implausible that Peter wouldn't recognize his own son in SOME capacity until the very end. And Langdon... Langdon just comes off as pretentious and two-dimensional. Yes, he has a Mickey Mouse watch. Yes, he's extremely claustrophobic because of an incident that happened when he was a kid. Other than that, he doesn't have many defining characteristics (or else the rest get blotted out because those two things are rammed down the reader's throat CONSTANTLY). It's annoying. 2 stars, 2.5 if I want to be generous. Here's hoping Inferno is better. ...more I was such a douchebag about this book before it was released.

The one that everyone is loving to hate, because there's no better way to prove your superiority to your peers by talking about how you're just too intelligent to enjoy this crap because you're so much better than the unwashed masses. For the record, I have dated two guys who have rattled off that bit of idiocy. Two! It's almost cruel (and for the record, they were really not all that). But more importantly, the book. If I lived on a desert island and someone handed this to me and told me that it had single-handedly saved the publishing industry during this current economic downturn, would I have believed them? Probably not. It's like The DaVinci Code set in DC, and therein lies the problem. Brown is a bit like M. Night Shyamalan, where his popularity was established by That One Thing He Did Well, except until he seemingly felt obligated to repeat it several times even when, creatively speaking, he'd probably write something more interesting if he allowed himself to do something different. Or, maybe he's more comparable to my beloved Preston/Child writing duo, who have locked themselves into only writing books about a fan-favorite character even though, again, some variety might rejuvenate them. Angels & Demons, the first Robert Langdon book, remains the high point in the series. At that point in time, Brown understood pacing. He understood how to move the story forward with exciting action while at the same time educating us about everything he had found in his research. It felt like a story. The DaVinci code lost a little of that and became more about the research and information, which led to my puzzlement over it being turned into a movie before A&D. And now, The Lost Symbol has completed the journey to the \"all information, no story\" side of the spectrum. It took me a week out of the 2 weeks the library is permitting me to have this book to get more than 150 pages in. The whole time I was reading, I kept thinking one word: \"INFODUMP.\" It's like Brown felt a bit of pressure to make sure he told us as much information as he could vomit up. Sure, the Freemasons are a pretty good choice for a secret-filled topic, and the National Treasure movies certainly showed us that DC is full of the symbols that Brown and Langdon specialize in. But it's not balanced, and to back up this opinion, I present the fact that it takes nearly 150 pages to move the action forward from the initial, \"Oh my god, there is a severed hand in the middle of the Capitol's rotunda.\" Trust me, if I found a severed hand, I would not be standing still for 150 pages. It was still interesting and a little fun, and the latter half of the book went a lot faster than the first half, and even though the plot twist at the end was predictable, I give Brown props for finally having a villain who ISN'T the mentor/person of authority. I also liked the throwback to A&D's discussion about science vs. religion and how they're entwined rather than opposing schools of thought. My advice to Brown now that he's done his duty and saved the publishing industry from the poorhouse - write something different. I know, your publisher would throw a total shitfit if you said you were retiring Mr. Langdon. You stopped being a person whose creativity is important back when The DaVinci Code hit the top of the best seller's list. You're a moneymaker, plain and simple, and they're gonna milk you until you're dry. I hope you get to write what you want next, and that it's not about symbols. It was fun learning about the NSA in Digital Fortress (you know, back before 9/11 and the Patriot Act made the agency a household name). ...more The use of a large amount of symbols and conspiracy buzzwords does not excuse one from having to actually write a compelling story. The \"twist\" in this books was easily visible hundreds of pages out and didn't surprise a single person I know who read the book. Now, I had very high hopes for this book as I am from DC and love the area, however there was so little of actual DC in the book(unlike DaVinci Code & Angels and Demons) that it seemed like it could have been in any city in the world ex The use of a large amount of symbols and conspiracy buzzwords does not excuse one from having to actually write a compelling story.

Now, I had very high hopes for this book as I am from DC and love the area, however there was so little of actual DC in the book(unlike DaVinci Code & Angels and Demons) that it seemed like it could have been in any city in the world except for what takes place in a few buildings. I enjoyed DaVinci Code as well as Angels and Demons so it's not that I don't like this style of book, but it seems almost as if this particular book has no real defined style. The entire book seems rushed and forced like the publishing company just told Mr. Brown that he had to write a new book, whether he had a good idea or not. Turns out... he did not. All in all, reading this book was like finding out that the girl of your dreams in high school... is now a man. ...more \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0639 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0647 . \u0648\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0639\u0647 (\u063a\u062b\u0627\u0621) \u0648\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u062c\u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627 \u0623\u062c\u0647\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0649 \u062a\u062c\u0628\u0631\u0643 \u0639\u0644\u0649 (\u0627\u0646\u0643 \u062a\u0637\u0646\u0634) \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0647 \u0641\u0649 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0626\u0649 (\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639)\u0641\u0623\u0646\u062a \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627 \u0633\u062a\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u062a\u0633\u062a\u0641\u064a\u062f \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0645\u0627 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0630 \u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0649 \u064a\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0647 \u0641\u0649 \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u062d\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0644\u0647 Ugh this was literally one of the worst books I have ever read.

Brown' Ugh this was literally one of the worst books I have ever read. Or, well, listened to, as Chris and I used it to get through 2 legs of a drive from NYC to St. Louis. Just to be clear, though I'm a stickler for good writing, I recognize that previous Dan Brown books like the Davinci Code are what they are. That is, they are good stories, badly written. And that's fine - there is a place for that - like 19 hour car rides. Unfortunately, the Lost Symbol was a terrible story, terribly written. Brown's prose has sunk deep into the depths of cliche and tired literary tropes - deeper than I thought he or his editors would dare go. What's worse, his dialogue is so hackneyed, grammatically flawed, and frankly stupid that you come to hate - literally hate - all of his characters. When one major character is presumed dead about 2/3 of the way through the book, I cheered. \"Drown, [name:], Drown,\" because I had come to despise that idiotic buffoon of a protagonist so much. The book was barely edited, with repetitive passages everywhere. If there is any one thing worse than suffering through Dan Brown's crap exposition once - it's suffering through it three times in a book because Brown's editors are too smug and lazy to edit this hack's writing. Storywise, too, the Lost Symbol bordered on pathetic. First of all, TLS is just a watered down retread of the Davinci Code reset in Washington DC. I was actually insulted by how thinly veiled this was. Do we have an American Sophie? Yes. A Sauniere? Yes. A police inspector who is somehow connected to the unfolding events? Yes. A psychotic killer? Um, hell yes. And it was this last character - the psycho, here named Mala'kh - that really ruined the book for me. Because unlike in Angels and Demons and in the Davinci Code, this villain was just a serial killer. Just a psycho. Not motivated by anything particularly meaningful except his bloodlust and desire for power. After sitting through HOURS of listening to this guy torture people, I wondered whether I was reading a Dan Brown thriller or a crappy knock-off of Silence of the Lambs. The fact that Brown had to resort to hours and hours of sadistic serial killer content shows just how flimsy his storyline is. And flimsy it was. Brown's whole plotline was filled with holes and deus ex machinas. To make his implausible, illogical storyline work, he had to make his characters into idiots who failed to see the most obvious facts in front of their faces. The ending is not a thoughtful surprise, but rather a massive, laughable letdown. Consider your worst case scenario of how you will feel at the end of the Lost series: that will be your reaction to the end of this book. Most of this book read like a badly written lecture from a cocky, second-rate professor from the University of Phoenix. Actually, I think that's more of an insult to the University of Phoenix. Avoid at all costs. ...more", "Title": "The Lost Symbol"},
