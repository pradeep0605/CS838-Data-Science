It leaves you more than just hanging, you are grasping for your life on a thread that is fraying and there is nothing to do but hold on (well metaphorically of course). One word that can sum up this book is intense . Everything is just felt more. The compassion, threats, action, betrayal, gestures, words all of it. This has to be the reason why it is so addictive. As expected from this series we are in for a ride. Some things are hinted out, but the full affect of what is going on isn't totally revealed till the very end. Though I felt frustrated at times this is a grand slam of a sequel. You know it's hard to hate Katniss for being the object of the whole love triangle. I usually get annoyed to no end and can't help wonder what people see in the person, but Katniss is different. Though you don't think that Katniss is particularly more special than others, but that is part of what you admire about her. Plus she is critical of herself so you don't necessarily get a good feel of what people think about her other than what is said with dialogue. I totally love this because frankly that is what it's like in real life. It's others that can show you who you really are when you aren't able to do it yourself. Peeta and Gale are both incredible guys and what makes them so great is that they both are good friends , something that is lacking in other books at times. Don't get me wrong there is a lot more to the series than the love triangle. <---A>Suzanne Collins</---A> gives us a lot to mull over till her much anticipated final climatic book Mockingjay . BTW Excellent Excellent covers!!! Later added: For those of you who didn't know there is a movie coming out for the first book The Hunger Games ! Here is the link to the trailer. Now just to wait for the second movie trailer...and the second trailer has arrived! Click here to view it. I got the chills guys. ...more I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music. And everybody in the theater laughs, and then the film cuts to Hitler laughing, watching a movie of a Nazi soldier killing Americans. It\u2019s one of those great story-telling mom I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music. And everybody in the theater laughs, and then the film cuts to Hitler laughing, watching a movie of a Nazi soldier killing Americans. It\u2019s one of those great story-telling moments where I\u2019m nice and comfortable and morally superior, until I realize that actually I\u2019m exactly the same as someone I think is Evil. There was a moment when I first saw Merchant of Venice that was like that, and I was depressed for a month after I read Notes from the Underground because of the same type of experience. I don\u2019t know where you get that brand of story-telling ability, but Suzanne Collins has it coming out of her ears, in the sort of young adult variety. <+++>Catching Fire</+++> was maybe not as striking as the first book in this series,<---M> The Hunger Games </---M>, in making me disturbed about myself, but it definitely had its moments. Also, I was in my second week of law school and had just gotten back from an exhausting wedding when I read it, so I might not have had the capacity to self-reflect that I normally do. If you don\u2019t know already, even though you should know, the premise of this series is a that in the future, post-apocalyptic world of the super-badass <---C>Katniss Everdeen</---C>, one rich city controls twelve poor-to-starving cities that produce all of the goods for the rich city. In order to keep the poor cities in fear, the rich city requires each of the poor cities to send one teenage boy and one teenage girl as tributes to play the Hunger Games. In the Hunger Games the kids have to kill each other until there is one survivor, who gets to party for the rest of his/her life but never really feels like partying because everything\u2019s so fucked up. Usually they go crazy, if they didn\u2019t start out that way. It\u2019s very Lord of the Flies , and yes it is the same premise as Battle Royale , but not as determinedly nasty as those two books. Also, girl action hero! Anyway, a couple of days after I finished this book, I was spacing off instead of briefing cases, and I started thinking about the description of the capital city that controls the other cities. There is a part where Katniss and another character have to go to a party at the capital, and there are as many amazing foods as they can imagine. It\u2019s a big party, and they\u2019re celebrities, and everyone loves them. They have one bite of every kind of food, so that they can taste everything, but unfortunately they get full. One of their entourage explains to them that there are puke closets, so that everyone can keep eating for the whole night, and our two characters suddenly step back from the party and remember their families and neighbors, who are starving while the capital lives in decadence. I was thinking about that and how the shallow people in the capital city were just as culpable for the evil in their society as the military that imposed starvation on the cities, and then, suddenly, I realized, duh, she\u2019s talking about me. This story is really about the global economy , and (passive, consumption-driven U.S. citizen that I am) I\u2019m not the hero. So, that\u2019s about three times this month that I\u2019ve been on the side of terrorists. I don\u2019t know whether that means story-tellers are gettin\u2019 pretty tricky, or if it just means I think there\u2019s a problem with the way stuff is. Or that, like, I\u2019m becoming a rager, or something. (FBI, if you\u2019re reading this, JK about this whole paragraph. LOL!) When I was working my 8-5 job last year, I started listening to some iTunesU classes while I was doing my work so that my brain wouldn\u2019t die. One of them was given by Carolyn Marvin at Stanford, and it was called \u201cTrue Colors: Myth, Magic, and the American Flag.\u201d The premise, to summarize very briefly, was that for any culture to stay together, the culture requires a blood sacrifice. This article goes into more detail about nationalism and blood sacrifice. She really convincingly pointed out how, civilized though we think we are, blood sacrifice in modern Western culture is not really significantly different than tribal human sacrifices. It\u2019s a seriously creepy theory, but I\u2019m not kidding when I say that she\u2019s right. Really, listen to the lecture. So, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks doing a mental compare/contrast of the U.S. with this futuristic dystopia. We don\u2019t come off looking too good, guys. Obviously these are really complicated topics, but nothing seems as simple as \u201cviolence is not the answer\u201d or, on the other side of the argument, \u201cdestroy civilization.\u201d I\u2019m not positive what the right answer is, but I\u2019d like to find out. I think Suzanne Collins\u2019s books should be taught in high school social studies classes, so maybe we could get some young brains working on this problem. How do we effectively refuse to benefit from universally destructive and dehumanizing trade practices, but still live healthy and productive lives? So, go read everything Suzanne Collins ever wrote (including the episodes of Clarissa Explains It All because that show is awesome) and reflect on international trade and the global economy. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be a better person for it, but I think so. Maybe after you do all that reading you can help me figure out some way for us not to be Evil. ...more Binge reading? Me?

So now that I've expressed my love for the book, allow me to rant. I HATE THE CASTING . Not all of it, of course, but Peeta, in particular. I'm sure Hutcherson is a fine actor. He's decent looking, that's not the point. The point is he's not right for Peeta. I loved Peeta in the first book, my love for him continued in the second. He's just so good . So pure, so nice. Self-sacrificial and genuinely well-meaning without being a martyr, and the on-screen portrayal of him ISN'T HOW I PICTURED HIM AT ALL. ARRRRRRGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!! /endrant Let's talk about the love triangle. If you guys know me, you will know that I absolutely can't stand love triangles. 99.9% of the time, they're useless. They add nothing to the plot, and they're only a device used to portrayl how ULTRA FUCKING SPESHUL AND BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT AND DESIRABLE THE MARY SUE MC IS. There's a love triangle in this book, and it was perfect. If a book has to have a love triangle, this is how it should be done. Gale is her long-time friend, almost a brother, for whom she naturally develops genuine feelings for. Their relationship is based on mutual respect; they take care of each other. They don't underestimate one another. Peeta is a tool. I don't say that in a bad way, like he's such a tool, man . I mean that he is a tool for Katniss' survival. Their \"love\" for one another ensured their survival in the Games. Despite Peeta's long-time crush on Katniss, she doesn't return his feelings, and in fact, held him at arm's length, under deep suspicion until he proves himself. So yes, I approve of this motherfucking love triangle. And I more than approve of this book. ...more I think I wouldn't be feeling quite so disappointed by this book if The Hunger Games hadn't been quite so close to perfect. But there it is. Must be hard to compete with yourself when you set the bar so high. Where The Hunger Games is a tightly-plotted, fast-paced dystopian thriller heaped with romance and horror, this book is... well, a lot of the same. A WHOLE lot of the same plot. Redundantly similar at points, only slower moving and far less polished.

Redundantly similar at points, only slower moving and far less polished. Too much of the story is told rather than shown -- whole months can go by in just a few pages -- and yet the real action gets rolling about two thirds of the way through the book. There were times when the story actually seemed to PLOD. That said, this is an ARC and things could change. Here's hoping this one sees some revision before its publication this fall. Collins is obviously capable of great things. And all complaints aside, this is a very compelling read. Fantastic characters, and the setup is definitely there for an interesting conclusion. I can't wait to find out what happens next. THAT said, marks off for deus ex machina abuse. ...more Warning!! SPOILERS AHEAD ... Well, kind of . No plot spoilers, just image spoilers. Don't read on if you do not want to see images of the actors cast in the upcoming Hunger Games movies . I am officially designating this review as my update central for casting on the Hunger Games.

As new characters are cast, I will post the actor's pictures here along with the images I find that imitate how they might look as the character they will be playing. LATEST UPDATES ON CASTING WOWZA! The best photoshopped pic I have seen of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss: So we officially have our Peeta: Okay, I just want to say that, while Josh is not what I had pictured, I trust those in charge. And Suzanne Collins gave her approval, so that in itself speaks volumes. Bottom-line is: Josh is workable. As long as they work with him to LOOK the part, and give him the eyes and most importantly the hair, I think he could be good. And our Gale: A little too pretty for my image of Gale. I also didn't picture Gale so beefy but instead trim and slim. Although for me, I was never too concerned with this role anyway. Gale never stood out to me as much as Peeta did in these books, so I would have been fine with nearly any choice. Once again, as long as they work their studio magic on his looks, he should do just fine. Willow Shields as PRIMROSE EVERDEEN Paula Malcomson (of SyFy's Caprica) as Mrs. Everdeen! Elizabeth Banks will be playing Effie Trinket Woody Harrelson is officially our HAYMITCH!!! The guy is awesome. I think he will pull it off without effort. Wes Bentley is Seneca Crane. Ummmmmm, yeah. [image error] If you ask me - this guy is way hotter than I ever thought Crane would be. Gah. He's frikkin hotter than the guy playing Peeta! Ceasar Flickerman will be played by Stanley Tucci. Excellent choice! Meet Rue and Thresh!! Amandla Stenberg and Dayo Okeniyi. They are perfect, and I am already getting emotional thinking about that infamous scene with Rue... *sigh* We also have our District 1 tributes!! Leven Rambin as Glimmer and Jack Quaid as Marvel. The unnamed District 3 Tributes have been cast:\u00a0Ian Nelson and Kalia Prescott. As far as the other characters, the news isn't out quite yet. It seems they will be looking for Prim and Haymitch soon. So I will post more info here once the news is out. Let me know what you think of the re-imaginings of these actors in their new character roles! ...more I can't review this without being spoilery, so... 1. AAAAAAAAAAAAAH 2. The one thing I didn't like about this book is the part where Katniss finds out she has to go back to the Hunger Games. I think there should have been more of a pause there--for disbelief, for Katniss maybe trying to think of ways out of it, ways to kill herself even. The book started moving at a really fast pace after that point, with Katniss and Peeta preparing for the next Games, and I was like \"wait, what? hang on a minute! I can't review this without being spoilery, so... 1. AAAAAAAAAAAAAH 2. The one thing I didn't like about this book is the part where Katniss finds out she has to go back to the Hunger Games.

The book started moving at a really fast pace after that point, with Katniss and Peeta preparing for the next Games, and I was like \"wait, what? hang on a minute!\" It was hard for me to believe that Katniss would willingly go back to the arena, at least not without major depression. One night of drinking didn't seem to cover it. 3. Everything else = awesome. The mockingjay imagery. The clock arena. The rebellion. President Snow being creepy as fuck. HIS BREATH SMELLS LIKE BLOOOOOOD! 4. As soon as Wiress and Beetee started talking about the chink in the force field's armor, I knew the answer to the Games was BRING DOWN THE FORCE FIELD. I was yelling and yelling at them to do it, and then finally they did, and I was like \"YES!\" 5. I find the love triangle a little annoying but mostly interesting. Katniss doesn't really know how she feels about either of them, because she doesn't have the freedom to feel on her own terms. I like that she has some makeout time on the beach with Peeta, though. 6. This series is reminding me more and more of Scott Westerfeld 's Uglies series. The evil oppressive government, the secret rebellion, the possibly-mythical place for them to escape to (The Smoke/District 13), hovercrafts, face tattoos, genetically modified plants/animals. I was hoping it'd go that way when I first read The Hunger Games . I was like, this government needs to be overthrown , Tally Youngblood-style. 7. \"This is why we don't let you make plans.\" HA! 8. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! WHEN IS BOOK THREE COMING OUT!!!!!!! ...more Oh, snap. She DID NOT just do that. This is not a cliffhanger people, this is inhumane. Like hanging on for dear life by a spider web thin thread totally butt naked (you know that makes it worse)! It's so worth it though. Quick overview: <+++>Catching Fire</+++> starts up not far from where The Hunger Games ended. Katniss is living in the Victors Village with her family. You'd think she could finally be able to relax and live the cushy life. Well that wouldn't make a good book. There are rumors of rebelli Oh, snap. She DID NOT just do that. This is not a cliffhanger people, this is inhumane. Like hanging on for dear life by a spider web thin thread totally butt naked (you know that makes it worse)! It's so worth it though. Quick overview: Catching Fire starts up not far from where The Hunger Games ended. Katniss is living in the Victors Village with her family. You'd think she could finally be able to relax and live the cushy life. Well that wouldn't make a good book. There are rumors of rebellion and since Katniss and Peeta won the Hunger Games in defiance they have become the faces of that rebellion. The Capitol, particularly President Snow, is not happy with them. Now Katniss has to worry about looking as in love with Peeta as possible to quiet down the rebellion, but is that what she really wants? It\u2019s really hard to summarize a book when you\u2019re afraid that everything you say will give away the twist. If you have not read the book DON\u2019T read a whole bunch of reviews or comments! You\u2019ll figure stuff out! Figuring out what\u2019s going on and the twists is part of what makes this so good. You think you\u2019ve got everything and everyone pegged only to find out that you only got half (if any) of it right. I wasn\u2019t sure what the second book was going to be about but now looking back I think \u201cOf course! How else would it have worked?\u201d The book starts off a little slow, but it\u2019s important for what Collins is trying to set up. I love Katniss and I hate her. She frustrates me beyond belief, but you have to love her. I love how you see and know everything from Katniss's point of view. You\u2019re just as confused and unsure as she is. It never feels like she\u2019s not a real person. You feel just as scared for her family. You feel her confusion and doubt. You just really feel. I could probably name off a bunch of things that bothered me about the book (I think I mentioned how I HAAAATE love triangles with a burning passion) but you really care about the characters. You can't even hate Katniss's team of stylists, who are selfish Capitol dwellers. The book deals with so much more than who she\u2019s going to end up with. At first I really didn\u2019t want to read it because I know how I am with these books. I get totally immersed, constantly trying to figure it all out. I can\u2019t believe the twists in this book! The ending is just so\u2026epic! How everything just falls into place and makes sense. You see the characters in a whole new light. And then you\u2019re left with the whole butt-naked-spider-thread thing. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not good for my health, but they say the same thing about oreos and fried chicken. So what do you read after a book like this? Well, you could look for a book that\u2019s just as addictive and gripping as this (Yeah, good luck with that), or read a book about kittens chasing after butterflies in a open meadow. Then you\u2019ll probably start thinking that there is a secret underground society of kitties just waiting for the right moment to emerge, and you find out that the butterflies are their spies! You see, this is the type of thinking you have after reading the book. It\u2019s beyond epic. Until the third book finally comes out I\u2019ll be hanging butt naked by a spider thin thread. ...more and now let's play the wildly popular RPG ADVANCED HUNGER & GAMES 2.0: CATCHING FIRE EDITION Our Players Katniss HIT POINTS: 25 ALIGNMENT: Chaotic Good SYMBOL: Middle Finger STRENGTH: 15 INTELLIGENCE: 10 WISDOM: 5 DEXTERITY: 20 CONSTITUTION: 15 CHARISMA: 25 FIGHTER: 10th Level Archer ASSASSIN: 9th Level Assassin SPECIAL ATTACKS: Resentful Attitude SPECIAL DEFENSES: Defensive Attitude SUMMARY OF PLAYER SKILLS: despite the inherent restrictions of living in a YA novel, Katniss is a remarkably well-develope and now let's play the wildly popular RPG ADVANCED HUNGER & GAMES 2.0: CATCHING FIRE EDITION Our Players Katniss HIT POINTS: 25 ALIGNMENT: Chaotic Good SYMBOL: Middle Finger STRENGTH: 15 INTELLIGENCE: 10 WISDOM: 5 DEXTERITY: 20 CONSTITUTION: 15 CHARISMA: 25 FIGHTER: 10th Level Archer ASSASSIN: 9th Level Assassin SPECIAL ATTACKS: Resentful Attitude SPECIAL DEFENSES: Defensive Attitude SUMMARY OF PLAYER SKILLS: despite the inherent restrictions of living in a YA novel, Katniss is a remarkably well-developed and complex character. although she's drawn from the familiar tough girl/outsider/square peg template, Collins resists softening her - her temper, her understandable but often misdirected suspiciousness, her frequent inability to empathize with others are never underplayed. her appearance at the end, where she appears to be slipping into depressive, semi-crazy, unreasoning mulishness, is very well-done and psychologically astute. i also love how her strengths are so nonchalantly illustrated - she is something special, but never a superwoman. her character's changes and growth and weaknesses and skills are carefully gradual and feel real - the reader is made to truly understand her, all of her. two sequences in Catching Fire particularly impressed me. the first one comes almost mid-way: Katniss' slow, painful revelation about the nature of oppression and the need for revolution, at one point moving from fear for her sister's safety and potential death if revolution occurs to understanding of her sister's life as a kind of living death already, if revolution does not occur. a great example of realistic character development that highlights Collins' sophisticated yet pleasingly transparent and straightforward writing style. _________________________ Gale HIT POINTS: 15 ALIGNMENT: Chaotic Good SYMBOL: Pouty Scowl STRENGTH: 20 INTELLIGENCE: 15 WISDOM: 5 DEXTERITY: 15 CONSTITUTION: 10 CHARISMA: 20 FIGHTER: 9th Level Ranger SPECIAL ATTACKS: Che Guevera Eyes SPECIAL DEFENSES: Come Hither Eyes SUMMARY OF GAME STRUCTURE: i love how Gale\u2019s appearances bookend the first two novels. it is an elegant way to illustrate this character\u2019s importance to both Katniss and the narrative itself \u2013 Gale sees two different kinds of Katniss in each novel; his reactions to her are different as well, and despite his own somewhat static characterization, it is through Gale that the reader is able to truly mark Katniss\u2019 changes in status and mind and spirit. even better, by saving him for the beginning and end, he gets put out of the way for the duration of most of each novel\u2019s action. although Katniss wastes a rather inordinate amount of time obsessing over him for a good portion of both novels, once she\u2019s in the arena, time spent mooning over her backwoods boyfriend is happily curtailed. i really like how Collins divides the time Katniss spends on each of her love interests; the romantic elements of the novel are as sharply structured as the novel itself, with its neat division into (1) the tour of districts and the burgeoning of revolution, (2) back home in District 12 and accepting the need for action (or, perhaps, flight), and (3) the game itself. just a few words for the game itself: AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. the game that takes up much of the final third of the novel is my other favorite thing in Catching Fire. the tension and danger, the pacing, the confusion of who should trust who and what did that person mean when they said that, the puzzle of what is happening in each deadly and differentiated section, the clock-like structure of the arena, and the immense difference between this game and the game depicted in Hunger Games... awesome! almost as awesome: the interview with the contestants, Katniss & Peeta's new look, Cinna's rebellion. really, i could go on and on. _________________________ Peeta HIT POINTS: 15 ALIGNMENT: Lawful Good SYMBOL: Big Spoon STRENGTH: 15 INTELLIGENCE: 20 WISDOM: 15 DEXTERITY: 5 CONSTITUTION: 10 CHARISMA: 20 FIGHTER: 9th Level Bread Baker BARD: 10th Level Public Speaker SPECIAL ATTACKS: Debilitating Guilt-Trip SPECIAL DEFENSES: He Actually Loves You SUMMARY OF GAME PLATFORM: i don't know how popular the character of Peeta is, probably because i am far from being a young adult - but i think his characterization is another wonderful achievement. it is not such an easy task to make A Good Person and Voice of Your Conscience without turning that character into a two-dimensional Marty Stu . Collins is able to accomplish this with ease (and this is a character whose every other line is practically I Love You Katniss), in scenes where mawkish sentimentality and eye-rolling clich\u00e9 are conspicuously, happily absent. her handling of Peeta's character is a hallmark of Collins' overall success. she writes of a dire world, one full of death and despair and undying love and family tragedy and trials & tribulations both romantic and violent. and she does it in way that is clean, polished, graceful, direct, and terrifically moving. ...more i'm gonna dangle some bait here: catching fire is the sloppy follow-up to hunger games , which seems to have been written in the frenzied fever of the author's realization that she had a megahit on her hands. the pacing is way off, the plotting is mechanical, the characterization is lazy, and the 'game' section is just lame. and the big reaping twist at the mid-point? it just sits there. it just happens and we're rushed in, totally pushing aside anything genuinely interesting for the sake of plot i'm gonna dangle some bait here: catching fire is the sloppy follow-up to hunger games , which seems to have been written in the frenzied fever of the author's realization that she had a megahit on her hands. the pacing is way off, the plotting is mechanical, the characterization is lazy, and the 'game' section is just lame. and the big reaping twist at the mid-point? it just sits there. it just happens and we're rushed in, totally pushing aside anything genuinely interesting for the sake of plot! plot! plot! it's actually kind of a shame b/c collins is terrific at coming up with story & plot elements, she's just kinda inept at assembling and executing 'em. yeah, i'm in the minority in this opinion... but i'm right. aight. chum in the water for my favorite type of goodreaders. y'know who i'm talking about: those weirdos (if you're over the age of 17, i wonder... who the hell are you? i mean, really? ) who love some wildly popular book and get all bent out of shape if someone - anyone! - disagrees with 'em, and shits semi-coherent & badly-worded snark all over the place. they've gotta be the same people who also cram political sites full of this kinda shit: 'obama is way worse then bush! wait till he takes away you're right to bare arms!!!' don't ya think? well, (as if you didn't see this coming), on to book 3. ...more Catching Fire was one of my most anticipated books of 2009. I loved it's predecessor, The Hunger Games and was so hopeful for this intstallment. I wasn't disappointed per se, but it did fail to meet my expectations. Here's a few reasons why... I don't know what it is with authors and their recent need to load up their books with a hundred or so pages of filler, but I really wish they would cut it out. There is lieterally about a hundred and some odd pages of this book that should have died on the Catching Fire was one of my most anticipated books of 2009. I loved it's predecessor, The Hunger Games and was so hopeful for this intstallment. I wasn't disappointed per se, but it did fail to meet my expectations. Here's a few reasons why... I don't know what it is with authors and their recent need to load up their books with a hundred or so pages of filler, but I really wish they would cut it out. There is lieterally about a hundred and some odd pages of this book that should have died on the editing room floor. The 9 months that Katniss spends in District 12 only serves to let us know that uprisings are occuring and she has been targeted by The Captial, all of which could have been summed up in a chapter or two. Second, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that about 90% of those of us who read and loved Hunger Games were team Peeta all the way. Though we knew Gale would be an issue, we were hoping Katniss would \"wake up\" and realize what a worthy, fine specimen she has in Peeta, well, it doesn't happen that way, and to say I'm bummed is an understatement. I'm kinda pissed. Katniss doesn't grow in this book at all. She is still a brash reacter, instead of a logicl thinker. I didn't mind it so much in the first book, because who wouldn't be, but the Hunger Games taught her nothing it seems, in either the way she responds to situations or in reference to how she really feels about the people in her life. Next, I get that Peeta was never much of a badass, but was it really necessary to injure him 10 seconds into the games? That irked me like nothing else. In hindsight, Peeta is one of the strongest characters, menatlly, if nothing else, and yet Collins reduced him to an invalid so that Katniss could rise up to the challenge. Please. It only made me roll my eyes and steam over the fact that I was going to have to read Hunger Games part duex, which wouldn't have been bad except for the fact that I was expecting something more. Which leads me to my last complaint, the games. Though I could see everything in this book coming, I thought it was rather brilliant to send them back to the games. What wasn't brilliant however, was the games themselves. They started out well enough, but after the crazy fog and freaky monkeys, Collins sort of lost me. Who cares if there is death traps all over the place if you know how to predict it and can avoid it? Not scary. Basically, this booked lacked the magic of the first, and failed to wow with new material as nothing new really happens. Yeah we learn a little more, and the last few pages shake things up a bit, but I shouldn't have to wait until I've read to the end to finally learn something interesting. There were moments where I would catch a glimpse of what made me love Hunger Games, and for that I give this book three stars. But I can't in good conscious give it more for it lacked character development and basically just served as a pit stop between books one and three. Hopefully the third will be better. ...more \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0634\u0639\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0644\u062a

Real SHOCKING Now without spoiler ,and to cut this review short Catching Fire tops the first part The Hunger Games by adding to the thriller, drama and the semi romance theme that were at the first book a new element \"Mystery\" The story here start after few months of the Games,slow beginning with how the life became, the preparing for the tour..then the President visit.. the capital festival.. The straggling ideas at Katniss mind between the fleeing away or stand for the rebellion.. The consequences of her talk with Gale.. The rumors of the last hope.. The Quarter Quell ..The shock..the 75th Hunger Games itself ....and finally the most shocking cliffhanger ending ever. The Power Points of the books: The repeated Events The author did a great job in here to not repeat herself,and when necessary since some of events that must be happening again as the first book it's different,deeper,got real meaning and emotional than the 1st book. For example the tour was very detailed at Distract 11 -which it should be since it's Rue's from P1- and then the next ones are brief. The Games itself got a new element as I've said at the beginning which is the Mystery of the characters ...was really very well written.and that lead to the surprising ending. The Characters Katniss : Now she's struggling since becoming in the spot light ,The pressure President Snow makes on her, her feelings for Peeta and Gale. It's real deep at this part and very confused..and that's really normal for her condition. The Mother,Effie,Haymitch are getting deeper this book..and I really loved the deeper the relationship between Kat and them in this book which is more emotional. And the new characters Finnick Odair ,Johanna Mason are the best add.. also the rest of the new characters are really important The Plot Very tense,and as I said Mysterious which wasn't at book one,The thriller is doubled and also the emotional scenes. Every chapter end with a cliffhanger make u \"What the ...\"or \"Oh My God\"...and that last until the very end.. ...more Spoilers? Oh boy am I going to spoil the SHIT out of this for you! So I got bored about halfway through and because I was bored I started focusing on the irritating things. So, Katniss asks a lot of fucking questions. This book should be titled Curious Katniss and the Game that she should play is \"How long can Katniss go without asking a question before we blow her skull to smithereens?\" Not very long! It'd be a really, really short booK and people like me would either rejoice, or be sad because Spoilers? Oh boy am I going to spoil the SHIT out of this for you! So I got bored about halfway through and because I was bored I started focusing on the irritating things. So, Katniss asks a lot of fucking questions. This book should be titled Curious Katniss and the Game that she should play is \"How long can Katniss go without asking a question before we blow her skull to smithereens?\" Not very long! It'd be a really, really short booK and people like me would either rejoice, or be sad because then we would have to find something productive to do with our time. You know, other than WRITE A LIST OF EVERY QUESTION KATNISS ASKS IN THE BOOK. I did that! See, along with other people asking questions (I didn't compile these) along with the slew of 'maybes' (please refer to a rundown of this later in my review) and the lack of anything interesting happening - this novel is a prime candidate for, I don't know, being used as toilet paper. Except I have too much respect for my arse to do that. Just because it's YA, it doesn't mean you get to get away with being shit. Katniss asks questions in her head and as a reader, we are privy to the inanity of her thoughts. Then I turned and as Gale and Haelle and all the kids waiting for me, so what could I do but go along?; Who is here? What do they want? Why is my mother so pale?; What could he be doing here? Perhaps I wouldn't have had such a problem with the questions if Collins didn't frequently go on a mad, frenzied self-questioning rampage, like so: If he knows this, what else does he know? And how does he know it? (...)loaded down with game? Haven't we for years? (...) Or have they> Could we have been followed? (...) Cameras? (...) what have they seen? Those questions were all in one paragraph. IT WASN'T A ONCE-OFF. And here's the rest of Katniss' internal monologue, for your reading pleasure. (...)what have I done?; What does he do? Drink it?; And who knows who else will pay for my actions? And how?; What would he do with the information, anyway?; (...)but how do I bein that coversation? Hey, Peeta, remember how I was kind of faking being in love with you?; (...)if I'd been raised in the Capitol?; Who else will I fail to save from the Capitol's vengeance? Who else will be dead if I don't satisfy President Snow? That really isn't the point, though, is it? (...) two victors chosen for the arena?; (...)than risking the alternative?; What would they do if I simply vanished? Disappeared into the woods and never came out? (...) start a new life deep in the wild?; What does this mean? (another barrage of questioning in chapter 4); Do what? Blow my lips up like President Snow's? Tattoo my breasts? Dye my skin magenta and implant gems in it? Cut decorative patterns in my face? Give me curved talons? Or cat's whiskers? (...) Do they really have no idea how freakish they look to the rest of us? How far south have we come in a day? If I had a bow and arrows, would I just keep going? What do they do? Have preliminary drawings? (...)make sure they're in the crowd? (...) offering to take her place?; Is it because I didn't save Rue?; (...)leaving all the words to Peeta?; Is she Thresh's grandmother?; (...) salute to the girl that defied the Capitol?; Who was that?

How is he even here? But Katniss doesn't keep her questions to herself; she annoys everybody else with them! I couldn't bear to NOT share the following with you. Katniss takes it upon herself to question everybody, everywhere \"You're hideous, you know that right?\"; \"Walk?\"; \"Did Cinna come early to help me get ready?\"; \"There have been uprisings?\"; \"Why don't you just kill me now?\" \"Who says I'm not?\"; \"What do you mean? How can I aim higher?\"; \"Did I design my outfit?\"; \"Why?\"; \"Where's everyone else?\"; \"Doesn't he need prepping?\"; \"What's yours?\" \"Orange? Like Effie's hair?\"; \"How do remember these things so exactly?\"; \"Does it help? To paint them out?\"; \"Want to see my talent?\"; \"Did you choose me, Haymitch?\"; \"Why?\"; \"...is there? Not being straight with each other?\"; \"About what?\" \"So, you're the Head Gamemaker this year?\"; \"Are you plannin the Quarter Quell Games already?\"; \"What?\"; (...)\"having a nightmare?\"; \"Are you sure you don't want it back?\"; \"Where did you get it anyway?\" \"Really? You don't think I'm mad? You'll go with me?\"; \"You're sure?\"; \"Do you think I'm making this stuff up?\"; \"What about your family?; \"Going to town?\"; (...)\"would you?\"; \"You will?\"; \"What?\"; \"No, but can you get Hazelle? SEnd her over?\"; \"Can you save him?\"; \"Can't you give him another shot?\"; \"What did you do in the arm months?\"; \"Why didn't you put this on him last night?\"; \"Where's Peeta?\"; \"Did he get back all right?\"; \"Have you seen Haymitch today?\"; \"Then what's your plan?\"; \"What's he want that for?\"; \"Ypu closed down too?\"; \"What is it? What does that mean?\"; \"Who are you?\"; \"Where'd you get the uniforms?\"; \"What's that about?\"; \"What are you going to do?\"; \"Thirteen?\"; \"What's wrong with your leg?\"; \"Anyone after you?\"; \"Making tea?\"; \"Out of food?\"; \"So, what's your story?\"; (...) expect to find in District Thirteen?\"; \"Really?\"; \"See what?\"; \"You're going to District Thirteen based on that? A shot of a bird? You think you're just going to find some new city with people strolling around in it? And that's just fine with the Capitol?\"; \"Why haven't they helped us? If it's true, why do they leave us to live like this? With the hunger and the killings and the Games?\"; \"Can I help you with something?\"; \"When did you say that?\"; \"You have a message for me?\"; \"Didn't it already?\"; \"How was school?\"; \"Why couldn't you get shrimp? Is it out of season?\"; Katniss continues to be inquisitive (and I lose my patience with using quotation marks but believe it, it's still her asking these questions! Out loud! Exclamation point! I begin to question them casually (...) I want to ask them more (...) \"Do you still think it won't work here?\"; But maybe at some point?; What do you think they'll do, Haymitch? To the districts that are rebelling?; So you think Thirteen was really destroyed?; What are you going to do?; It'd be bad for you in the arena, wouldn't it?

(...) do you?; (...) did he?; So what are we wearing for the opening ceremonies? Headlamps or fire?; How did you do this?; What do you spend all yours on, anyway, FInnick?; Then how do they pay you for the pleasure of your company?; Have you seen your suit turned on?; Are we supposed to hold hands this year?; The families?; What?; Why?; So why bother?; You mean you want us in the Career pack this year?; (...)is that what you're saying? Why does that not surprise me?; What about you?; How are we going to kill these people, Peeta?\"; Why did Haymitch want us to get to know them?; You painted something didn't you?; Why would he paint a picture of me, Effie?; Is it a secret?; Have they ever given a zero?; Why did they do that?; (...)piece in their Games?; So, what should we do with our last few days?; You?; What?; Then you'll allow it?; So, what am I wearing tonight?; Was this heavy?; Will I be twirling again?; the most beautiful thing?; The others went home?; What?; What do you think?; Sun?; Each take one side?; Remind me, did we make deals with anyone else?; What?; Peeta?; Peeta?; Is this your token? Can't you hear it?; Whose is it?; What is it?: Can you fish with it, Mags?; Can you take them both?; Finnick?; Where did they go?; Think it's safe to try for the water again?; Why don't you two get some rest?; (...)haven't looked pretty?; What now?; What does she mean? She got them for me?; What do I have to work with? Seawater?; So what were you doing with Nuts and Volts?; Are you thirsty?; Did you notice anything unusual in the others?; Prim?; At the final eight?; No?; You really believe that?; Do you believe it, Finnick?; Who?; Was that the earthquake year?; Did she get better after?; I mean, her mind?; Do you think they figured out about the clock? Why not?; Guess who I'm not fooling with that story?; Ready?; Peeta?; Peeta?; Who cut you?; The first one? Why?; What?; Where is Peeta?; Like bait? Like how they'll use Annie for bait, Finnick?; Prim?; They're not in District Twelve?; If the questions weren't enough; Katniss, or Collins herself, is also plagued with self doubt. Uncertainty! Oh the horrors> There were at least 125 maybes mentioned in this book, which may not seem like much but once you're aware of them, they're fucking everywhere . Here's a great example from Chapter 15; Maybe he's too pretty, or maybe he's too easy to get, or maybe it's really that he'd just be too easy to lose. . Yep, that was altogether! Here's a few more, Maybe she expected it. Maybe they can even confirm my suspicions of an uprising there. Maybe some fishhooks. Maybe you're a Class A irritating fuck, that's what. Some of Collins' sentences are also horrific; Then I'm at a party where everyone wears masks and someone with a flicking wet tongue, who I suppose is Finnick, stalks me, but when he catches me and pulls off his mask, it's President Snow, and his puffy lips are dripping in bloody saliva Yeah, by horrific I don't mean the content. Check out that eyesore. Sheesh. AND she starts a lot of sentences with conjunctions. Which I do continually. Which, in my opinion, is fine if you are stating something emphatetically or are not a published author. Perhaps it's even okay to let the odd one slip if you do so happen to be so lucky as to get your shitty novel published. When that odd one adds up to the point where it's actually noticable and fucking annoying, then you've got a problem . Just when I was starting to get really irked at this flaw, I stumbled across this gem from chapter 16 to prove to you exactly what I mean. \"And the more I come to know these people, the worse it is. Because, on the whole, I don't hate them. And some I like. And a lot of them are so damaged that my natural instinct would be to protect them. But all of them must die if I'm to save Peeta.\" So, in conclusion, I am really glad I don't own this as an actual IRL paperback and I could just delete it thus disappearing it back into the void where this whole book should have stayed in the first place.

But really, in this terrible dystopian world, I think things had to get worse for Katniss before she decided that something had to be done. Things decidedly get worse. Her second worst nightmare happens: she's going back in the arena. Gah! I totally remember the first read through around that that was the last thing I expected. She realizes her first worst nightmare will probably come to pass in one way or another: there are going to be deaths. She can't protect everyone (major foreshadowing), but she'll die trying. I'll amend something I mentioned below: I do think this is maybe slightly better than HG. I can't really pin point it. It's a great book. Both are. HG introduces us to a world we can't imagine, and Catching Fire starts to show the cracks. The growing pains have begun. You can only suppress and oppress people for so long until they say \"enough\". Twelve districts live for the single benefit of the Capital. Did you get it the first time? She's the girl on fire, so they put in in the one place where fire can't burn: Water. And lots of it. I thought the idea of the clock was genius, not only in it's written execution but also in the metaphor. Your time is short. Your life is short. I think I even learned a thing or two about human nature. Also, don't pre-judge people. Of course, you're right 95% of the time, but 5% of the time, people will surprise you. They might be brave and noble hiding behind snobby and aloofness. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (previous review) Loved it!!! Totally not what I expected, but a good story. Although not as jaw-droppingly good as the first book. Less action, especially in the first act of the book. Action picks up later, but is still not as good as the first one. Still, a good 'middle' book, for what I expect to be a trilogy. Provided a little more backstory, and certainly a lot more foreshadowing of what will be happening next. Can't wait for the next one!!! ...more Testing, testing... one, two, three.

And there doesn't seem to be room for anything else. If we could get somewhere safe, maybe I could be different.\" Announcing the 75th Hunger Games: Nice Natalie: Cynical Natalie: Calm your emotions, woman.

This scene: \u201cI'm going to wake Peeta,\" I say. \"No, wait,\" says Finnick. \"Let's do it together. Put our faces right in front of his.\" Well, there's so little opportunity for fun left in my life, I agree. We position ourselves on either side of Peeta, lean over until our faces are inches from his nose, and give him a shake. \"Peeta. Peeta, wake up,\" I say in a soft, singsong voice. His eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we've stabbed him. \"Aa!\" Finnick and I fall back in the sand, laughing our heads off. Every time we try to stop, we look at Peeta's attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it sets us off again.\u201d Nice Natalie: *happy sigh* Cynical Natalie: I am allergic to joy. Moving on! Katniss/Peeta pearl scene: Cynical Natalie: This scene is problematic. Look: \u201cNo one really needs me,\" he says, and there's no self pity in his voice. It's true his family doesn't need him. They will mourn him, as will a handful of friends. But they will get on. Even Haymitch, with the help of a lot of white liquor, will get on. I realize only one person will be damaged beyond repair if Peeta dies. Me. \"I do,\" I say. \"I need you.\" He looks upset, takes a deep breath as if to begin a long argument, and that's no good, no good at all, because he'll start going on about Prim and my mother and everything and I'll just get confused. So before he can talk, i stop his lips with a kiss.\u201d One, Peeta is acting like those YA heroine who have nothing to live for except their love interest. Two, Katniss kisses him to shut him up. She admits it. Him talking makes her confused, so she basically uses sex to manipulate him. How's that different from Christian Grey using his dick to silence Ana? Nice Natalie: We don't know much about Peeta's family life since Katniss never bothered to find out. I'm not saying it's right, but she had bigger things on her mind, like President Snow and handling PTSD. I'm willing to admit that scene is little weird, but Katniss doesn't do it all the time. It's only a problem if she frequently uses her body to shut Peeta up. She's obviously overwhelmed and unsure of her feelings towards him, so she acts on instinct. Katniss isn't good with words, she's all about action. The ending: Nice Natalie: MY FEELS ARE RUNNETH OVER. Cynical Natalie: Why are you talking like you're in a Shakespeare play? After reading: Nice Natalie: Five stars. The writing's better, and Katniss has become a very complex character. The stakes are off the charts. Cynical Natalie: I concur.

After President Snow threatens her family and friends, Katniss tries to put out the fire she stated, but her efforts only seem to encourage more dissent. Snow\u2019s revenge is to pull her back into another round in the arena to shut her up once and for all. I was impressed with the first half of the book which did not try copy the first book\u2019s pattern, but instead put Katniss into a new situation of reluctantly trying to carry out Snow\u2018s commands to help quash the burgeoning political discontent. There was a lot that could have been done with Katniss in that role, and the book seemed poised to follow through with that story. Unfortunately, Collins chickened out and decided that the readers wouldn\u2019t be happy unless Katniss was back in the arena. So while the new death match is a bigger and badder version of what we saw in The Hunger Games , it ends up seeming familiar and a letdown kind of like The Hangover Part II . (\u201cIt\u2019s the same story as before, but this time it\u2019s in Thailand!!\u201d) I was far more interested in the idea of Katniss evolving from terrified political pawn into the revolutionary that she seems destined to be than I was in seeing her once again fight for her life.

The almost absurd seriousness of her voice and her behavior toward Peeta tipped me (though I did have to give her kudos for being absolutely kick-ass). The cavalier treatment of Haymitch's alcoholism, the total lack of sensical world-building and the sentence fragments grated on me. I enjoyed it, yes; but love it, I did not. I was all set to throw in the towel with this series. It's been a year since I read The Hunger Games , and I wasn't on any kind of tenterhook to find out what happened next. I'll admit, when I picked up Catching Fire it was with a sort of do-I-have-to groan, because it was practically thrust into my hand by a friend who is totally batshit crazy about these books and demanded I keep reading or die. So I cracked it open on pain of death and started reading. The first seventy or so pages are ridiculously boring. Katniss and Peeta literally do nothing but travel around and eat. It was during this time, when there was no violence or gratuitous nudity or mildly sexual romantic tension to distract me, that those absolutely heinous sentence fragments really caught up with me. Look, this book is obviously intended to be written as a stream of Katniss's consciousness, so I absolutely understand an abundance of fragments. But these fragments are nonsensical. I literally had to read some sentences five times just to understand what Katniss was trying to say, and let me tell you one thing: that's a fantastic way to totally alienate your reader from the narrative. The fragments would cut a perfectly comprehensible sentence into two incomprehensible halves. Welcome to Logicville. Population: none. So why'd I give this book four stars? Because I read it in something like two and a half days, and although the plotline felt repetitive, half-hearted and sort of a caper, it was just great. So much better than the first book. Let me say something: Suzanne Collins must be a brilliant dressmaker, because she has an uncanny talent for embellishing obnoxious things and making them seem 100% less ridiculous than they actually are. This is the plot of this book. Katniss and Peeta hear rumblings of uprising among the Districts, meanwhile President Snow, for some strange reason, is still not satisfied with Katniss's show of fake love for Peeta (even though EVERYONE else - literally EVERYONE - is. Like, how much more convinced does he think the people need to be?). So this creates a lot of unnecessary conflict, while Katniss bounces between Gale and Peeta, even though she knows herself that she's not sexually attracted to Gale and at this point the reader is already fully aware that in the end, she's going to pick Peeta. How could she not? He practically has \"I am a non-threatening love interest\" tattooed across his forehead. This series is a lot of things, but unpredictable it is not. So anyway, a Quarter Quell is announced, in which a male and female tribute from each District will be selected from the existing pool of victors, ergo, the folks who won will be in the arena again (and that, ladies and gentlemen, is what makes this book fucking great. The feeling of sheer betrayal from the Capitol's decision to haunt the victors with another Hunger Games is what carries this whole book). Yadda yadda, lots of violence, and then a bad guy turns out to be good and Katniss and Co. are all rescued from the arena, save for Peeta, who's been horribly abducted by the Capitol (tears for that). Let's start with the love triangle, which this book pretty frequently relies on to supply tension. I've been pretty hard on the love triangle, but I really shouldn't have been: it doesn't convince me at all and to be honest I never felt any chemistry between Katniss and Gale or Katniss and Peeta, but at least it didn't feel tacked on. It felt premeditated and it does forward the plot, so kudos for that. Plus, the Katniss in this book is much more human, a Katniss I could better relate to. She's tough but emotional, self-assured yet apologetic, compassionate but practical. Her voice held a little note of sarcasm which I just loved , because I always felt that the maudlin narrative of the first book really did border on angsty and I can't deal with that shit. You feel me? I better felt who Katniss was in this book, and as such, I felt like I could grow to care about Peeta and Gale as characters, though not as love interests - like I said before, I could've cared less who Katniss ended up with because none of the romantic relationships ever really interested me. Note that it is true what they say, that Gale and Peeta are practically the same character, except Gale tends to be irritatingly convenient in his reactions and tends to jump to the most nonsensical conclusions, so I do tend to prefer Peeta. I don't know what it is; Peeta's just lovely. And he's a little clumsy and awkward, which I find incredibly endearing. Catching Fire sees Katniss and Peeta forced to participate in a second round of the Hunger Games. It's a Quarter Quell, which occurs every twenty-five years, and means the Gamemakers toss in a curveball to freak everyone the fuck out. These Games were nowhere near as threatening as those in The Hunger Games . That was mainly what warmed me to the first book: the terror of entering the arena blind, unsure of what was going to happen next. In this book, the reaping happens in one paragraph, there are two pages of meals and dresses, and then they're straight into a particularly creative arena which was thrilling, but not frightening. My problem with these Games was that everything felt like it was moving very slowly. After the gong sounds, there wasn't the jump of the heart that occurred with Katniss's first Games. There was just Katniss falling, Katniss running, Katniss swimming, Katniss doing this and that. After she reaches the Cornucopia, there's time for some witty dialogue between her and the unspeakably fabulous Finnick Odair, and then they mosey on over to Peeta, pick their weapons with strategy, then wander into the jungle. Urgency? Oh, please. So why was this book such a success, in comparison to the previous and more tense installment? Well, because the character development in this book is far superior to that of first one, in that each character feels more complex, each exchange of dialogue feels more natural, and somehow, for some reason, Peeta and Gale began to actually interest me as separate people in their own right. They felt necessary, like humans rather than big cardboard cut-outs of Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson*. In the first book, all of the characters go through the entire book without changing at all by the end. Katniss was already a hunter, Peeta was already a baker and painter, and Gale was already brooding and angsty. By the end of the games, nothing inside the characters had really changed. Katniss was still a hunter, Peeta was still a wet rag, and Gale...blah. Who cared about Gale at the end of the first book? Whatever. There wasn't a single character arc to be found. Just people doing stuff and that stuff causing other stuff. So while The Hunger Games excelled in candy gore and adrenaline-charged action, this book has more substance . I felt like it mattered. *Don't flame me, you little bitches. I read the book like a year before the movie came out, okay? In essence, I felt like a lot of this book was kind of a caper. Well, maybe not quite a caper, but it was more like an adventure novel than a terrifying thriller. I loved the twists, especially Plutarch Heavensbee, which I did not see coming, not for a second. There was a lot of clothing description, which was great fun (hurrah for Katniss's mockingjay outfit! That was dope) and while a lot of the arena time felt sort of Tomb Raider -esque, it was wildly entertaining. That's the essence of Collins' writing, at least for me. Technically, it's kind of lame, but she knows how to put across a story with just enough heart to convince the reader to give a shit. Despite the somewhat sweet-shoppish atmosphere of the Games, there were plenty of darker areas to this book. The Capitol's killing gentle Cinna, Katniss's hopeless entrapment in the Quarter Quell, Mags's death in the arena, the morphlings, Finnick's love for Annie and, most pungently for me, the glimpse of Haymitch's time in the arena. It was sickening, really; to throw back to teenage Haymitch, his connection with Maysilee, and his victory in the games after a disgustingly bloody battle with his final opponent. Guys, his intestines were literally hanging out and the girl was killed with an axe to the head . How anyone can still not like Haymitch after this is beyond me. This is the reasoning behind his alcoholism, his anti-social personality, and eventually (view spoiler) [his rebellion as he collaborates with Plutarch Heavensbee to get Katniss out of the arena and into District 13 (hide spoiler) ] . Oddly, Katniss was one of the very people who expressed no sympathy whatsoever for Haymitch, despite witnessing his disturbingly awful stint in the arena when there were twice as many tributes as usual (Haymitch competed in the 2nd Quarter Quell). She's horribly judgmental, and apathetic toward him, and frankly, it left me irritated. I may be the only person on the planet who actually likes Haymitch, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. Needless to say, I absolutely fell in love with Finnick. Do I even need to say why? Nah. No need. It's Finnick. That's why I fell in love with him. Because he's Finnick. The cliffhanger at the end of this book bothers me. I suppose it's that ingrained disgust for cliffhangers their sneaky little money-grubbing ploys, and the creepy marketing strategies behind them. You're literally trapping people into buying the next book. How about relying on the actual quality of the story to invite in readers for the next book in the series, rather than inadvertently begging them to line up at midnight for the release? It's just really, really jammy. For shame, Scholastic. P.S. The blurb for this book is a lie. Gale does not have an icy exterior, and Peeta does not, at any point, ever, turn his back on Katniss. Nobody ever turns their back on Katniss. They all love her too much. Seriously. Everyone loves Katniss. Everyone. BONUS TIME! This is disgustingly good.

Victory in the 74th games has not been all that sweet for surprise double-victors Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. And it is extremely sour for the reigning government. Katniss had shown them up big time when she publicly defied the gamemasters to keep from having to kill Peeta, an act of sedition as much as it was an act of courage and honor. President Snow burns with rage at Katniss for showing up the games, the Capitol, and him personally. He recognizes that it is necessary to give the subjects of his government some hope, but Katniss and Peeta have provided a spark to the tinder of popular resentment, and Snow needs to forestall a conflagration. The author Katniss is not in a good place back in District 12 after the games. Yeah, she has a nifty new house in the victor village, and her family is well taken care of, but she is experiencing a fair bit of PTSD. Collins describes Kat the victor. She has nightmares. She has flashbacks. And in the beginning you can see she\u2019s practicing avoidance. She\u2019s completely pushed Peeta to arm\u2019s length, you know? She\u2019s trying to stay away from him. Why? Because everything associated with him except some very early childhood memories are associated with the Games. She\u2019s conflicted to some degree about her relationship with Prim because she couldn\u2019t save Rue. So she\u2019s dealing with all that, and her method of dealing with it is to go to the woods and be alone and keep all of that as far away as possible, because there just are so many triggers in her everyday life. - from the Time interview Part of the requirement for games winners is to go on a Victory Tour across all the districts. One of the soft spots in the logic of the story is that President Snow would think for a second that parading across the defeated districts the youngsters who had killed their children was anything but a guaranteed recipe for disaster. It is believed that Katniss' popularity and selling the lie of her death-defying love for Peeta would gain some love for the Capitol, and would dampen public unrest. Sure, whatever. Of course, Katniss manages to fan the flames of the people\u2019s unhappiness with things as they are by her acts of kindness and respect for some of her fallen competitors and their families. As her popularity grows, the pin she wore in the 74th games, the mockingjay, spreads as a symbol of resistance. I am sure Emily Dickenson would approve. Time for Plan B. With his hopes for a palliative Victory Tour in ashes, Snow come up with another plan. How better to douse the embers of hope than to destroy all those who would fan the flame. So, for the 75th games, instead of a new crop of potential contestants, children between 12 and 18, from whom game contestants might be selected, he decrees that this time the tributes (those selected) will be chosen from the pool of prior winners. Hell-uh-oh, Kat and Peet, this means you-oo. Hell hath no fury like a president scorned. There is no law, only power, and Snow aims to char those caught, or even suspected, of playing with matches. And if crushing the Hunger Games victors from all twelve districts crushes the rebellious spirit of the people, well, may the odds be ever in your favor. Of course, we all know there is a third volume in the series, so I am giving nothing up by reporting that the plan goes up in smoke. There are many notions in play in Catching Fire , among them visions from the classical world of Greece and Rome. The whole notion of the games was taken from the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. King Minos of Crete had issues with Athens. There are varying accounts of how this came to be, but the accounts agree on the arrangement that was made. Athens was forced to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every nine years to make a nice snack for a Minotaur, who resided in a labyrinth constructed by Daedelus. The kids are sent, but Theseus, an Athenian prince, wanted to get rid of the Minotaur, and thus the need for kid-burger specials, and so inserts himself in place of one of the young\u2019uns. He gets some help from Cretan princess Ariadne, who offers a way for the children to escape the Minotaur\u2019s maze after Theseus, hopefully, dispatches the beast. Her solution is significant here, beyond the classic story, as the unraveling of string, of a sort, figures large in Catching Fire in helping out the tributes. Katniss Everdeen grew from a raw teen in Book I to become a warrior. She grows stronger still in Book II, overcoming her fears and miseries, growing in strength, even while accepting that her fate was likely sealed. She is a gladiator, thrown into an arena to do battle for the pleasure and control of the rulers. And another classical notion comes in here, the slave warrior leading a rebellion. Katniss, by defying the Capitol in Book I and by her actions this time, has become the face of popular resistance, whether potential or kinetic. There are contemporary issues that resonate as well. Collins said: The Hunger Games is a reality television program. An extreme one, but that's what it is. And while I think some of those shows can succeed on different levels, there's also the voyeuristic thrill, watching people being humiliated or brought to tears or suffering physically. And that's what I find very disturbing. There's this potential for desensitizing the audience so that when they see real tragedy playing out on the news, it doesn't have the impact it should. It all just blurs into one program. - from Scholastic article And it is not exactly news that we are increasingly living in a world in which the one-percenters get to live lives of obscene luxury while working people are denied basic rights. The ancient Roman practice of eating to excess, then using a vomitorium to make room for even more indulgence is brought up in Collins\u2019 vision as a very telling link between decadence old and new. And then there is the romantic element. Peeta is a wonderful guy, pure soul, gifted communicator, smart, strong as an ox, loves her, but, while she may find him attractive as a friend, does she find him attractive enough to throw over her childhood sweetheart, Gale? The pressure is unspeakable as the President, in order to save his own face, is insisting that she and Peeta make good on their cover story from their first game together. At the end of the 74th, Katniss had threatened pairs-suicide if the rulers insisted on having a single winner, and she prevailed. But the Capitol sold it as a manifestation of her love for Peeta, while the reality had been that she had stood up against the Capitol rulers. She agreed to help sell the lie after the games in order to keep bad things from happening to her family. Peeta and Katniss have to cope with the public lie of their being a couple, but must also contend with the fact that they really are very fond of each other. Add in another hottie in the shape of the studly Finnick Odair (a tribute in the 75th) and the potential for emotional imbalance is considerable. Some of Collins\u2019 secondary characters get to spread their wings a bit, most particularly the District 12 mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, who gets to do a lot but much of his activity is told after the fact rather than shown. The president, Coriolanus Snow, gets to strut and fret his hour upon the stage, issuing threats mostly. I expect it is no accident that the president\u2019s given name is the same as that of a Roman consul notorious for his low opinion of the ruled. Ok, I really enjoyed this book. I do have one gripe, though. Really, you knew there would have to be one. The Hunger Games story is really one long tale, and in order to keep from having to sell the book with its own set of wheels so you can tote it around, the publisher has divided it, like all Gaul, into three parts. (Unlike the greedy film makers who are taking it a step further and making four films out of a trilogy) And while it may make sense for this volume to have ended where it did, it seemed to me that it went from full on action to see ya next time in an awful hurry. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s my gripe. I had originally intended to make this a four-star rating, but on further consideration, in light of what Collins has done in terms of looking at real issues in a serious way, while offering top-notch entertainment, bringing in cultural foundations, and for making me root for a teenager to do something other than get a bad case of zits or run afoul of a serial killer, I am upping it to five.

When I finished it, I looked back and realised how cheap the book was and how, essentially, it is the first book again. I hated the first book, and to have it repeated on myself again was frustrating and poor taste. Did I say cheap already? It was like the author had only one trick up her sleeve, so she reused it on me. The first book in disguise The capitol fears uprising in its districts. In the last games it was clear that they had accidently created a beacon of hope, though I don\u2019t know why anybody would be inspired by Katniss Everdeen. The Capitol then, in an incredibly idiotic move, tours the beacon that they detest around the districts. The districts see their beacon and, quite naturally, are inspired by the flame. I just can\u2019t understand why the Capitol would do this; it is completely self-defeating. They are fuelling the fires of the rebellion they wish to quench. Why not simply kill Katniss and make it look like an accident? It wouldn\u2019t be hard to do; I\u2019d fake a train crash. The Capitol is absolutely terrible at being an overlord, again. So, the first books\u2019 tributes were picked at random; this time the tributes are the champions of previous games. Therefore, you would naturally suppose that this next batch of contestants would be quite effective killing machines. The reverse is quite true because most of them are weak and one\u2019s completely deranged. They don\u2019t seem to do a lot either when they\u2019re in the games; they just hang around in a reluctant manner. It was quite surprising that any of these actually managed to win their respective games as they\u2019re quite useless and get themselves killed in what is, quite frankly, amateur ways. These guys are supposed to be experts. The only ones that actually manage to do some killing are just characterised as generic brutes, so not really survival experts. Cheap writing Katniss really began to grate on me in this novel. I found her flat to begin with, but now I just hate her entire characterisation. She is so na\u00efve and just plain unpleasant to Peter. Their relationship, at this point, is clearly for the stage, but she doesn\u2019t have to be so mean to the poor guy. He is clearly in love with her. And she clearly will be in love with him eventually. This was such an obvious route to take with the story. I think it would have been much more interesting if Katniss has continued to have proper feelings for Gale. Or somehow fell in love with the enemy. I hate this predictable book. Her internal monologue is completely terrible; it\u2019s like the author doesn\u2019t know how to write down someone\u2019s thoughts. Katniss seems to think in a series of questions at points. She has no meaningful thoughts or observations of the world, and she comes across as quite detached and stoic when describing the games. I found this odd because she appears to be quite an emotional girl, nothing wrong with that, but it didn\u2019t quite add up with her bland observations of the world. She really is a weak protagonist because she is written so badly. Moreover, the idea that she has become, essentially, a messiah and a leader of a rebellion is even harder to accept. I think her actions are completely uninspiring and are, of course, self-serving because she is just fighting for her own survival. The believability of her new status is very minimal and almost forced; it just didn\u2019t quite work for me. Thus, I gave this novel a very low rating; it is essentially a verbatim repeating of the first book. I do not feel like believable progress was made nor has any of the characters has any believable development. For me, this is another terrible book by Suzanne Collins. The Hunger Games 1.

It did lack the perfect pacing of the first book, the first half was a little slow and for some time I wasn't sure where it was going, but it picked up immensely in the later part. What else can I say? This book was all I wished for and even more (and my expectations were very high after rereading \"Hunger Games\"). I am dying to get my hands on the last 3rd book! P.S. If before reading \"Catching Fire\" I was concerned whether I would be able to stay on Team Peeta with more time given to Gale, I am not any more... Update 8/23/10. Still love it. The first half is still slow - even though a lot of horrid stuff happens in it - but intensity goes over the roof once the Quell's terms are announced. The ending left me with a feeling of sadness, but different from the sadness I felt after finishing The Hunger Games . If the 1st novel ended tragically in a personal way - Peeta's broken heart and Katniss's renewed fear for her life, the 2nd makes you think about a tragedy of a bigger proportion - will the districts be able to defeat the Capitol and how much many lives will it cost them? I love the wider scope of this second novel - we slowly learn (along with Katniss) about what goes on in Panem. The girl hardly knows her own importance, her worldview is definitely very limited and locked onto her own and her family's survival. I can relate to that. My opinion about the love triangle has changed, however. Really, this book is not about which boy Katniss will pick. It's about much bigger issues. Katniss can figure out who is right for her, when she is finally in a position to stop worrying about both Gale's and Peeta's safety. The genius of this series (so far) is that I have no idea what will happen in Mockingjay . Whatever it is, I hope my favorite characters will make it, although I am sure Suzanne Collins is not the type of writer who is afraid of killing off her own creations. We shall see. My only qualm about Catching Fire is that it's a tad heavy on dressing up. Editing one or two gown descriptions wouldn't have hurt IMO. ...more What do you write about the perfect book?

Funny thing is I really disliked the movies and I found the characters boring and annoying. I only watched them because they were so popular. But I've been rewatching them as I'm reading the books. And I've completely changed my mind. I cannot get enough of them. I hate myself for not being able to read as fast as I can watch a movie. I feel I need more and more. And I dread reading Mockingjay because then it would all be over. And I don't want it to be.

President Snow and his controlling of Katniss made my skin crawl. I can't wait until someone settles his hash in the third book. Of the new characters introduced, I have to say Finnick is by far my favorite. The carnage level was ramped up significantly in the death match part of the story. The combatants were a lot more capable and the threats were much much worse. The nerve gas in particular is going to stick with me. The growing unrest really makes this feel like a transitional book. It almost feels like the Empire Strikes Back at times. Instead of the whole \"Ben, why didn't you tell me?\" at the end, it's (view spoiler) [Haymitch.

She seemed very strong in the first book but not so much in this one. Also, I know the whole Katniss/Peeta/Gale love triangle is supposed to be a big part of the story but Gale doesn't get developed enough for me to really care about him and Peeta's feelings for Katniss are a little on the unbelievable side given Katniss barely gives him the time of day most of the time.

I really like the idea that Katniss' act of survival was the spark that flamed a revolution. The first part of the book deals with this theme and, once again, it was engrossing and thrilling. The very idea of a revolution, how Katniss and her family and friends deal with the aftermath of the Hunger Games, how gradually life becomes impossible in District 12, are all very well depicted. Sadly, however, again Collins sends her message excessively. Sometimes I think that she doesn't think the readers can understand the meaning of her story on the first time she implies it, so she makes sure to reinforce the subject every three chapters. Accordingly, I found tossing Katniss into another game for survival a little repetitive. I believe there are many different ways the author could have dealt with the theme of Katniss standing up for the revolution, and this was the least original. Regardless, I did enjoy reading about the small and subtle signs of revolution at every district; it turned the whole affair much more real than if the revolution had just exploded everywhere completely out of the blue. It was also interesting to read about the Capitol and their corruption games, though I would have loved to know more about how they operate regarding politics. Well, as the story goes on, we are at a new arena; there are allies to be made, people to be killed and somehow it was a sense of deja vu for me. I just did not want to read the entire thing again. At some point, I also mentally moved away from all the action because Katniss was far too clueless about everything. As a symbol of the revolution, surely she should have been kept informed, right? In the first book, her lack of knowledge merely lends more suspense to the story. In this, it seems rather silly to not tell her who are on her side and who are not. It makes no sense at all, especially if they want her to survive. Ok, I get that sometimes the best way to protect someone is to omit information from them, especially if they are thrown into a pit full of enemies without clear knowledge of who their enemies are, but letting Katniss go about the Games completely clueless weakens her character too much, in my opinion. It just doesn't work for me that in one book Collins depicts her heroine as weak and dumb, just a lamb following the herd; then, all of a sudden, she is a bad ass courageous Robin Hood wannabe kicking everybody's buts and taking control of a revolution. Just... blah. Anyway, the way the author deals with such a heavy story line, managing to build the whole revolution down from the details, giving the reader a full picture of what is going on not only in one place, but everywhere, was brilliant. Not every author out there, from my experience, can do that without rendering the story into a muddy ocean of confusion and boredom. Every time I felt things were not making sense anymore, BAM!, there was a clear and cohesive revelation lying on the next paragraph or chapter. So, for Collin's ability to write a good story that kept me interested, I give it 3 stars. ...more I have met the Anti-Bella, and her name is Katniss Everdeen. In Bella Swan, heroine of the Twilight Saga, a generation of young readers (and some old ones) were introduced to a new post-feminist role model. And many of them, upon being introduced, threw up a little bit in their mouths. It turns out an exaggerated look at life through painfully self-conscious eyes is, well, painful. In contrast, Suzanne Collins, in the first two books of her Hunger Games trilogy, has crafted a self-conscious but si I have met the Anti-Bella, and her name is Katniss Everdeen. In Bella Swan, heroine of the Twilight Saga, a generation of young readers (and some old ones) were introduced to a new post-feminist role model. And many of them, upon being introduced, threw up a little bit in their mouths. It turns out an exaggerated look at life through painfully self-conscious eyes is, well, painful. In contrast, Suzanne Collins, in the first two books of her Hunger Games trilogy, has crafted a self-conscious but sincere heroine -- Katniss Everdeen -- that takes juvenile fiction and junior heroines in a powerful new direction. Let's review why Katniss Everdeen is the Anti-Bella: 1. Katniss will kill you. Bella may have mortal and immortal enemies. But she doesn't really want any of them to die. In fact, Bella's special vampire power ends up being, wait for it, a force field . That's right, her special kick-it power is that she, um, keeps people safe! Katniss, on the other hand, will kill you, no questions asked. She will agonize about it, she will regret it, and your memory will haunt her, but she will kill you if you stand between her and the safety of her family and friends. 2. Katniss can dress up like nobody's business. I truly love Collins for this. What post-feminist young woman doesn't want a heroine who, with some fabulous body paint and special effects, is the hottest dresser at a fab public event? I even love the disdain that Katniss has for her hotness. She accepts it as something that has to happen, all the while rocking the fashion world. Bella can barely be persuaded to put on a prom dress, for crying out loud. 3. Katniss really knows how to love two men at once. Remember, this is juvenile fiction, so I'm not proposing an erotic tryst! But where it counts most, Katniss finds herself really loving the two young men who are devoted to her. And it genuinely tears her up inside because these guys are good to her -- not just hot in a torn t-shirt or obsessively clingy way -- but really interested in making her happy and keeping her alive . Who doesn't want that in a boyfriend? 4. Katniss is truly heroic. This is where Collins really wins. Katniss is a heroine who has to face hard choices, who puts herself at risk for a greater good, not just out of blind self-obsession. Her perils, despite being pure fictitious contrivances, become genuine because Katniss responds to them with genuine heroic acts. And then when she speaks, she brings it home. Bella, on the other hand, can barely string a few words together without sounding awkward (what with all the lip biting, which I'm sure hinders clear speech). In the end, I finished book two of this series eager to hear more from this lead character, and to hopefully see her mature beyond her narrow circumstances. And while I gave the third and final book four stars, it turns out the last book isn't even about Katniss Everdeen. Not really. Its central character is someone much more long-lived: War. Read my review of Mockingjay to see what I mean. ...more To be honest I cannot believe I actually liked this book.

But everything changes when the Victory Tour begins. Threatened by the Capitol and the President himself, Katniss has to be very careful while touring the Districts. For even the smallest spark of rebellion may ignite a revolution... Initially, this was a great follow-up book to the events described in The Hunger Games . From the changes in District 12 to the spectacular shows of the Victory Tour, it was easy to see that something great was brewing. Unfortunately, everything went downhill in the second half of the book, and while the first half was arguably the best part of the series so far, the second was definitely the worst. There is little more to say about the writing and the characters than what I wrote in my review of the first book, so I will stick to my opinion about the plot in this review. Catching Fire is shaped by two very different pieces of news. The first of those is that while planning the 75th version of the Hunger Games, a so-called Quarter Quell, the Capitol decides to call previous winners back into the arena to fight for their lives once more. The second is that they're might be something hidden in the ruins of the infamous District 13, the district that led the rebellion against the Capitol and was subsequently annihilated. The introduction of the Quarter Quell is terrible. It is certainly logical for the Capitol to introduce them, but it was a terrible decision from Suzanne Collins. It seems like she just needed some excitement to fill the rest of the book before writing about something that would actually advance the plot, and chose to just throw in a new gladiator fight because it excited people so much in the first book. It could have been a masterstroke, but the way it was executed made it a huge disappointment. Since there is really no question about if the protagonists will survive or not either, it was also quite boring, and made me sit there hoping it would just end as soon as possible. The second part was worse. District 13 was to me, and still is, one of the most interesting topics in this series. It is brought up quite early on, but the only thing you learn about it in the book is idle speculation, and then in the end it iss just revealed casually in a conversation like it doesn't really matter at all. I almost rated the book one star because of that, but I realised it would probably be best to be rational about it. In my opinion, this book should have been a lot better. It built my excitement and made me so interested I almost couldn't put it down, and then not only crushed all of that, but almost made me want to give up the series entirely. Still, if the third book is as good as the first and the first half of the second, there might be hope for me still. ...more GAHHHHH. This book. I am SO HAPPY I decided to reread this series before the final movie comes out. So much happened in this one and when I saw the movie originally I thought it was a SPOT ON adaptation but they did actually change a few things and leave out some world-building stuff. Makes sense for a movie but I'm glad to have reread it and pulled it back into my mind. These books are phenomenal. Just brilliant.", "Title": "Catching Fire"},
