Set partially in 1950-ish Ireland and partly in Brooklyn, the novel follows spineless and benign Eilis through her voyage to the United States (arranged by her sister and a kind priest), where she receives a job, is enrolled some classes, is encouraged to do volunteer work, is set up with lodging at a boarding house, gets picked up and courted by a faultless Italian American, etc.<---F> All passive voice intentional</---F>. She doesn't really make any decisions on her own until the end of the novel, and even that was basically for lack of realistic alternative options. Other than a tragic death in the family and a little homesickness, nothing bad ever happens to Eilis and there isn't any real conflict. At some point she has to choose between her life in New York and a roughly equivalent life back in Ireland, but she studiously avoids finding out anything that could force her to form an opinion. We are teased with tantalizing potential plot threads: a brilliant professor who might be a Holocaust survivor and is impressed by her curiosity about her bookkeeping law classes, her unpleasant landlord and her unpleasant old boss communicating and exposing her brief \"double life,\" an Italian boyfriend who looks suspiciously unlike the rest of his family. But no worries, these aren't pursued into anything that would risk causing conflict. In defense of the novel, I found myself very compelled to finish it, the prose is serviceable if not brilliant, and it is in general a thoroughly pleasant read. My ORD->DEN flight went by delightfully quickly because of it. And now I'll go back to Henry Roth. ...more Image source (work by Anthony Gormley): http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EoNMfeXg4L0...

It\u2019s well done, but I couldn\u2019t see what all the fuss was about. Then she is unexpectedly summoned home. The situation and dilemmas arising could be crass, predictable and dull, or overly sentimental, or just implausible. They are none of those things. The ending was brave and brilliant, and pushed the book from 3.5* to 5*. The most powerful aspect for me was (view spoiler) [big spoiler coming up: (view spoiler) [ that she went back to Brooklyn, presumably to Tony, but carefully puts the photo of her and Jim on the beach in the bottom of her suitcase (hide spoiler) ] (hide spoiler) ] . I hope Toibin is never tempted to write a sequel. So Much Unsaid There is a gradually intensifying theme of important things going unsaid: lips sealed, omissions from letters, replies unread. It\u2019s no great insight that the longer one waits to reveal something, the harder it becomes, and the more complex the consequences. Toibin\u2019s skill is in making chronic inarticulacy agonisingly convincing: there\u2019s always the nagging hope that if one puts it off, it may somehow not be necessary. Eilis\u2019 inexperience may look like naivety, but the more we understand of her inner thoughts, the more her intelligence, introspection, and perceptiveness about other people\u2019s motives peek through. She\u2019s not inarticulate in her head, only in real life, though she tries to suppress her own thoughts as well, \u201cThe best thing to do\u2026 was to put the whole thing out of her mind\u201d. The gaps in her letters home mean \u201cthey would never know her now\u201d and maybe they never had, otherwise they would not have sent her to this strange land where she does not fit. But it\u2019s not just Eilis: all the main characters hide their true selves and desires ( (view spoiler) [hence a brief scene with lesbian overtones (hide spoiler) ] ), and even prevent others from doing so: \u201cIt was hard to speak since her mother seemed to have prepared in advance every word that she said\u201d and had a way of \u201cspeaking that seemed to welcome no reply\u201d. \u201cNot telling her mother and friends made every day she had spent in America a sort of fantasy.\u201d You can rewrite a fantasy, which makes reticence appealing, but it doesn\u2019t change the truth \u2013 or the ramifications. Appropriately, the plot hinges on someone who DOES speak up, but whether the consequences are good or ill is suitably ambiguous. Toibin has consistently demonstrated the problems of what goes unsaid, but he stops short of recommending honesty at all times, because there is no single answer. We each have to decide for ourselves when to hold back and when to open up. Either way is risky. Inertia, manifested as silence or omission, often seems easier, as Eilis knows so well \u2013 yet she does it again and again. Pulled Two Ways: An Outsider in Two Realms Eilis moves from her predictable and familiar town where she has spent (and expected to spend) her whole life, to a city where even the staples of bread, butter, tea and milk, are strange, and \u201ceverything [is] frenzied and fast\u201d. She may speak the language, but \u201cShe was nobody here\u2026 a ghost in this room, in the streets on the way to work, on the shop floor. Nothing meant anything\u2026 She\u2026 tried to think\u2026 of something she was looking forward to, but there was nothing\u2026 It was as though she had been locked away.\u201d Just as she\u2019s becoming at ease with Brooklyn, she finds herself an outsider again, when she gets to know an Italian family, and finally when she goes back to Ireland, changed. This is the obvious theme, and it\u2019s why I chose the photo of the Anthony Gormley sculpture. But because it\u2019s more obvious, and is part of the reason for all the unsaid things, it somehow felt less important. Or maybe it was secondary because I identify with it too strongly: there are so many axes along which I have been, and still am, neither one thing nor another, even though I\u2019ve never lived more than 150 miles from my birthplace. However, Eilis learned to fit in in America, and having found that chameleon quality, I am hopeful for her. Plot (view spoiler) [Eilis is a young woman in a small town in 1950s Ireland, studying bookkeeping. Her older brothers live and work in England, and her older sister, Rose, works to pay for Eilis and their widowed mother. With little prospect of local employment, Eilis is despatched to Brooklyn, with the aid of Father Flood, a friend of Rose. She lives in a boarding house, headed by Mrs Kehoe, has a job in a department store, and goes to night school to qualify as a bookkeeper, all arranged by Fr Flood, who also organises Friday church dances, from where she gains an Italian boyfriend, Tony. Rather than an explicit proposal, he talks of future plans that \u201csuggested that marriage been already tacitly agreed\u201d. A sudden death sends her home for a short visit. (view spoiler) [She secretly marries Tony before leaving. (hide spoiler) ] . Emotional and practical manipulation inevitably extend the trip. Time to fall in love, perhaps: heart and duty, separated by the Atlantic. Seasickness, homesickness, new people, strange food, love, death, love triangle, Catholic guilt. (hide spoiler) ] Just another bildungsroman? No, it\u2019s so much more. UPDATE re Film Overall, I thought the film was pretty good. It was understated and looked and felt \"right\" to me. The luminously ethereal Saoirse Ronan is perfect as Eilis, and the screenplay and cinematography included lingering shots of her pensive face, showing something of her inner doubts and struggles about what to say and what to leave out. Julie Walters is excellent as Mrs Kehoe, and dinner at her lodging house is suitably on the knife-edge between fun and awkwardness. Inevitably, some things were missed out: no brothers (a sensible omission), almost nothing about Rose (Eilis is on the boat within minutes, and without much explanation), and no hint she has ambitions until Fr Flood enrolls her at Brooklyn College. But none of that impairs understanding or changes the nature of the story. My one gripe is the one I feared: the ending was tidier. Not only did she definitely (view spoiler) [ return to Tony, but (view spoiler) [the photo of her and Jim on the beach was never taken, let alone packed in her case back to Brooklyn (hide spoiler) ] (hide spoiler) ] . However, there was one really good addition near the end, (view spoiler) [on the boat, she gets talking to a young Irish girl heading to Brooklyn for the first time, and she takes on the role of advisor, as Georgina had done for her.

The story then settled into how she built her new life, complete with a job at a clothing store, night classes to learn bookkeeping, relations with her catty fellow boarders, and ultimately with Tony, his brothers, and the Dodgers. It was a more innocent era (even in the big city). At that point I was wondering if it was possible to be nostalgic for a time and place you\u2019ve never experienced. People were generally nicer; more thoughtful. Then again, I wondered whether an era like that when polite behavior and higher standards were de rigueur would be more likely to come down hard on subtle deviations. Would social acceptance be too narrowly defined? Seemed like something interesting to consider in light of the book\u2019s focus on manners, integrity and the social fabric of the day. I was happy enough with the manufactured, third-order conflicts. It helped that despite her passive nature, Eilis was likable and observant. (I\u2019d be curious to know if women who read this think T\u00f3ib\u00edn did a credible job getting inside the head of his young protagonist.) Then, towards the end, BAM! -- you get genuine, first-order conflict. I won\u2019t spoil it for anyone, but will mention that certain dilemmas were laid out well: old life vs. new, family duty vs. commitments to others, the growing comfort of the here and now vs. the fading memories of pleasures past, and romantic prospects vs. \u2026 what (?). There\u2019s a pay-off to reading through to the end. Which way will the wind blow? Will Eilis be blown with it? It was a story simply told and all the more forceful for it. Update: I\u2019m happy to report that the movie adaptation was a good one. It\u2019s not a substitute for the book, of course, since there is plenty of interior life a film can\u2019t hope to capture. But the screenplay was clever (Nick Hornby is apparently good at these things) and the acting was first-rate (I hope Saoirse Ronan scores an Oscar nomination). Four to four and a half stars plus one upturned thumb speak to a fine book/movie double. ...more A simple but universal coming-of-age story, beautifully and gracefully told Usually I read the book before seeing the movie, but in this case I saw the movie first.

I only now caught up with the novel. I\u2019m so glad I did. It really made me appreciate Nick Hornby\u2019s adaptation. In 1950s small town Ireland, Eilis Lacey has few prospects in life; there are no available jobs and even fewer available men. So when a priest offers to sponsor her to emigrate to the U.S., she accepts, even though she\u2019s sad to leave her mother and older sister, Rose. Once in Brooklyn, NY, she adjusts to working in a department store and living in a rooming house, but she\u2019s desperately homesick. That eases up when, with the help of that same priest, she takes night school bookkeeping courses; she also meets a charming Italian-American man, Tony. All is going well until she\u2019s called back to Ireland. T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s prose is clear and unadorned, befitting the book\u2019s simple, forthright and industrious protagonist. One of my writing teachers told me that showing characters who are good at what they do is a sure way to build sympathy for them, and I loved reading about Eilis\u2019s skill with numbers and facts. There\u2019s nothing flashy about her; she\u2019s modest, sensible and hard-working, but she\u2019s also got a fine sense of humour. She\u2019s no pushover. I like that Eilis is studying bookkeeping. She\u2019s concerned about things adding up in both columns. When exciting things start happening in her life, she wants to be left alone to reflect on them. She\u2019s a classic introvert. After she meets Tony, she probably intuitively adds things up in the relationship column (she wishes he were taller); when she\u2019s offered a larger room at the boarding house, she tries to figure out the why and wherefore of the offer, and whose debit and credit columns will be affected. What\u2019s remarkable is how quietly and yet powerfully T\u00f3ib\u00edn presents Eilis\u2019s narrative. I loved all the details about the department store \u2013 its billing system, the one-day-a-year pantyhose sale that\u2019s spread by word of mouth. One theme that\u2019s not explored in the film is how the store adjusts to the times; when its savvy owner realizes the neighbourhood is changing, it begins catering to African-American customers, and it\u2019s fascinating to see how Eilis reacts. This is the new world, with opportunities for all. There\u2019s also a tiny scene about one of Eilis\u2019s instructors, whose family was killed in the Holocaust. Eilis\u2019s story made me laugh and cry: her loneliness, her hard work, her spirit of charity, her growing confidence. The book\u2019s final section finds her back in Ireland, and the way she sees her old life \u2013 what used to be her entire universe \u2013 is profound and moving. The book\u2019s denouement happens a little quickly. The film\u2019s concluding scenes are much more satisfying emotionally \u2013 we need to see certain things resolve. But the spirit of book and film are the same. The story of journeying from one place to another to build a new life for oneself is universal. To\u00edb\u00edn finds a fresh, unpretentious way to tell it. Brooklyn is exactly why I love a certain type of literary fiction: to get deep into character, to understand where people come from, not just geographically but psychologically and emotionally. One final note: there are two references to a Nora Webster in the book. That\u2019s the name of T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s eponymous 2014 novel. Am I stoked to read it? What, are you a feckin\u2019 eedjit? (Pardon my faux Irish curse.) Of course I am. ...more Some books are worth sticking with.

After around a hundred or so pages, I was beginning to wonder if this book was actually going anywhere. There was a completer lack of plot, as the mundane life of an ordinary girl unfolded in all its blandness. However, as the novel progressed it built up momentum, ever so slowly until the point where it became a heart racing crescendo of uncertainty. The true shame of this book, and perhaps its reason for such a mixed reception here on goodreads, is how many readers such initial storytelling would put off and even lose altogether. So what\u2019s good about this book? Plot wise, it sounds like a tiresome clich\u00e9, so I\u2019m not even going to attempt a summary. Instead I\u2019m going to consider what the novel actually captures. Decisions are always important, but every so often a decision so powerful will come along that either direction you take will completely alter your life hereafter. We\u2019ve all experienced that moment, a moment where if you went down a certain path (as Robert Frost would say- \u201cthe road not taken\u201d) our life would be different today. Some moments are just that strong; they don\u2019t come along very often, but when they do they linger for what feels like an eternity. And this is what the book builds up to in its eloquent simplicity. For Eilis her decision is vast and unpredictable. This becomes such a crucial part of the storytelling. We can\u2019t predict such moments. No matter how bland and ordinary our lives may appear, you can\u2019t predict what may happen in your life. Sometimes something, or someone, comes along that threatens to change the game completely. Your life becomes something else, and your reaction to it may come to define the rest of your days. Eilis becomes torn between two lives, one she has grown to love and one that is undoubtedly her comfort zone. Her coming actions will stay with her forever, as she ponders what could have been. The novel also chronicles a huge part of modern cultural history. As a historical novelist, Toibin has captured many of the viewpoints of the 1950s along with various social transitions. The world is becoming more modern; thus, there is a shift in attitudes towards race, sex and marriage. The older generation characters are more conservative, and remain resistant to this asserting sense of newness. Some of the younger characters, but not all, are more open and accepting. We see a multitude of opinions and attitudes, ultimately, recognising which ones will become dominant. So here is a book that has very little in the way of actual plot, but I urge other readers to look beyond that. The story is a mere vehicle, a means for the author to capture these intense moments of confliction and uncertainty. In this sense, it chronicles a large part of what it is to be human. ...more 2.5 Stars I'm sorry to say BROOKLYN was a disappointing read for me.

Saoirse Ronan as Eilis - she dazzles in the role Eilis Lacey is a fully realized character you will be able to relate to, someone you will remember.

This is not an action-oriented page turner, no shoot-outs or car chases, literal or figurative. Instead it is a beautifully written, patiently paced tale that is well worth the reading. ============================= EXTRA STUFF Links to the author\u2019s personal , and FB pages An article in The Guardian from October 10, 2015 - Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn on filming his novel Brooklyn: 'Everyone in my home town wanted to be an extra' An NPR interview of Toibin by Jacki Lyden An article from The Telegraph - May 21, 2015 - by Olivia Parker - Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn: Writing is always a battle against your own laziness Saw the film on Tuesday.

There were small moments of brilliance: the terse passages of what was not said, which was the most telling, yet those glimmers were rare. I could not identify in the least with Eilis, she was so one-dimensional, barely there and characterized as mostly bored when she was present in this book. Her mother and glamorous older sister decided she must go to America, so she does! A priest manages a hard-to-get passage, work status and job but how? and why?? She ends up in a rooming house in Brooklyn with a job as a salesgirl in a department store...great! Life in the rooming house was pleasant but bland, her job was almost non-descript (except for the reader learning how salesgirls made change via pneumatic tubes--that was described in exquisite detail) despite her being launched from a tiny Irish village into the incredible diversity and cultural whirlwind of life in New York City! Eilis just waltzes in an smiles pleasantly at times when Mr. Toibin wants us to know what she's doing. Hardships? Well, there's loneliness--we're told of a day she spent with a crooked smile because she's lonely! so the omnipotent priest puts her in night school to fill her time and she manages to excell! Halfway into this I realized she's a Mary Sue! That's great for Mr. Toibin but rest assured there is very little emotion or connection on the reader's part for this girl. The author just points and shoots her to the next scenario which she scurries through successfully--there was no way I could identify with this character or care much for her trials (few) or triumphs (many). The secondary characters also needed more time, more development to come to life for me. They were barely two dimensional. Occasionally, again, that glimmer, but overall, it was just words telling me about these people, the life they were marching through. Most disappointing to me, really lacking in insight and in truism was the ending. I don't want to spoil this more than I already have, but there was no feeling of...\"ahhhhh\" when it was done. The ending, while putting on the face of happiness rang hollow. It makes me wonder if Mr. Toibin schemed to pull a great private joke over all of us who really want to gush about it and hug it to our heaving bosoms ala \"Bridges of Madison County\" (gag-gag). The most interesting thing about this book was looking over the accolades from those who reviewed it. I couldn't wait to relish every word when phrases like, \"A Triumph!\", \"a moving, deeply satisfying read\", and \"exquisitely detailed fiction\". I was surprised when I finished it and reviewed the praises, wondering if I had read the same novel? If I had enough time and had a tick more crazy in me (give me maybe 10 more years), I promise you I would send a hand-written note to each reviewer suggesting they either didn't read the book or jumped on the love-train while pretending to have read it. I seriously think I will write to a certain Ms. Zoe Heller (author of THE BELIEVERS ) to ask her how on earth she can possibly make the unfounded claim that Mr. Toibin \"writes about women more convincingly...than any other living, male novelist\"?

While I admired her and sympathized with her plight, the combination of aloofness & meekness did not make for a happy mix, tough to warm up to. Not till over halfway in did this story grab me but once it did it held on. With conflict & the complications of life kicking in \"The answer was that there was no answer, that nothing she could do would be right. And she saw all three of them as figures whom she could only damage, as innocent people surrounded by light and clarity, and circling around them was herself, dark, uncertain.\" and Eilis maturing into someone more interesting. I\u2019m glad I saw it through, had fun with her moral struggle and flash of rebellion. As for the book\u2019s conclusion? Poignant and perfect! So 3 1/2 stars rounded down to 3 - less a reflection of the novel\u2019s merits, more on my inability to empathize with the main character. Cons: The writing is really simplistic.

She becomes so homesick that she makes herself ill. She starts taking night classes, and later meets a nice boy at a dance. Eventually, she has a difficult choice to make: stay in America or return to Ireland? But this is one of those novels in which there is greater feeling and emotion than the simple story would imply, because we are following the heart and mind of an independent being. Eilis is a character who is fully formed \u2014 we know her thoughts and desires, and we silently urge her on her journey. I was excited to read this book when I saw a quote from the author, saying he was inspired by Jane Austen and her \"method of examining a single psychology, using an introspective, sensitive heroine, some comic characters and some romance.\" I love all things Jane Austen, and was eager to see how Mr. T\u00f3ib\u00edn would apply that method. The result is charming and heartfelt, loving and bittersweet. At times I was moved to tears for Eilis, and at others, so anxious for her that I had to remind myself it was just a novel, just a novel. But is it just a novel? America is a country of immigrants, with millions of stories, and this is one of them. It's a beautiful story, and one I will cherish. Favorite Quotes \"Until now, Eilis had always presumed that she would live in the town all her life, as her mother had done, knowing everyone, having the same friends and neighbours, the same routines in the same streets. She had expected that she would find a job in the town, and then marry someone and give up the job and have children. Now, she felt that she was being singled out for something for which she was not in any way prepared.\" [on her desperate homesickness] \"None of them could help her. She had lost all of them. They would not find out about this; she would not put it into a letter. And because of this she understood that they would never know her now.\" [on a harsh winter in Brooklyn] \"It made her almost smile at the idea that no one in Ireland knew that America was the coldest place on earth and its people on a cold morning like this the most deeply miserable.\" ...more OK, Man Booker award people, listen up!

Where does Toibin\u2019s particular genius lie? Well, there\u2019s the writing, of course. Which is remarkable for being so completely unremarkable. If that seems like a backhanded compliment, let me assure you that it is meant as quite the reverse. I think it takes a phenomenal talent (and a certain gutsy confidence in one\u2019s own talent, which the author most definitely has, and just as definitely has earned) to write as unobtrusively as Toibin does. Nothing in his style draws attention to himself as author. Instead, time after time, he finds the right voice, so that the writing flows in a completely natural way, without a word in the wrong place. How does he do this? The answer brings us close to the scary heart of his genius, I think. It\u2019s because Toibin lets his characters take over in a way that few other authors manage to do. He becomes them, he channels them. To say they are \u201cfully realized\u201d, \u201cdeftly drawn\u201d, that they \u201ccome to life on the page\u201d \u2013 whatever reviewer\u2019s clich\u00e9 comes to mind \u2013 doesn\u2019t even begin to do him justice. Empathy is surely one of the qualities we expect from any great novelist, and Toibin does empathy like no other modern writer I know. I find his ability to inhabit his characters both fascinating and scary. It scares me because it so exceeds my own powers of imagination. No matter what, or when, I write, I can never get away from being me, a very particular individual, with my own very specific 52-year old history. It\u2019s probably why I have never understood the fascination of online role-playing games, or the ability of others to fabricate alternate online personae \u2013 no matter the forum, with me it\u2019s pretty much WYSIWYG all the way. But it\u2019s one of the reasons I prefer fiction to non-fiction \u2013 if only vicariously, I find that truly good fiction has the power to take me out of myself, and to stretch my capacity for empathy, even if it\u2019s only briefly. In his novels, Colm Toibin does this over and over again. I imagine it as being a wholly draining experience for him. But as a reader, my admiration for him is boundless. I\u2019d like to close this review by offering my congratulations on his upcoming receipt of this year\u2019s Booker prize*. Because if there is any justice at all in this world, this is a man who has it coming. Read this book. Read all of his books. And see if you don\u2019t agree with me. *: \u201cBrooklyn\u201d has been \u2018long-listed\u2019, I am happy to report. ...more Thinking again about this lovely book, nearly seven years after I first read it, how it has stayed with me, how T\u00f3ib\u00edn has moved and influenced me as a reader and a writer.

At first blush it seems a simple coming-of-age story of a young Irish immigrant alone in New York. But T\u00f3ib\u00edn, though he writes with affection, keeps enough distance from his characters to allow his reader to form opinions about the choices these characters make and the motivations behind their actions. He shows, rather than tells, the bewilderment and liberation that are part of a willing immigrant's experience; how the absence of the familiar can lead one to behave in bold or reckless or shameful ways. He also captures perfectly the returned immigrant's experience\u2014the reverse culture shock that occurs when returning to one's homeland. The immigrant, the sojourner, has changed, yet everything and everyone at home remains as it was. T\u00f3ib\u00edn reveals this sense of dislocation, how it feels to be of both worlds yet not belonging fully to either. T\u00f3ib\u00edn allows Eilis, his young immigrant, to experience her life without clouding her actions in pop-psychology self-awareness. This is a gracious, sweet and subtle story from a master of nuance and heart. ...more I was hugely dissapointed in this book.

The characters are cardboard cut-out, lacking in complexity, unrealised and utterly unconvincing. The central character is so passive that it is scarcely believable and she simply can not sustain my interest. Toibin indulges in long descriptive passages telling us about his protagonist's state of mind, her intentions and reasons and her reflections on events. Very rarely however is any of this conveyed in conversation between the characters. There are very few passages of dialogue - certainly any meaningful dialogue. This, for me, is a telling manifestation of the characterisation problem. Toibin can not give these characters a voice - because he does not really believe in them. You combine this with a very dull chronology of events that is the framework for the story and really, you have nothing. I completely disagree with the reviewers in the British media and the New York Times who are falling over themselves to find the positives in this novel. One reviewer suggests that the novel is in some way deceptively simple and subversive. So I suppose if you disagree with them it's just because you were not sufficiently alert or intelligent to see the subversion. Nonsense. They are being hugely dishonest about all this - why, I do not know. Toibin's editors and publishers are advising him badly and must only be interested in promoting him as a literary star - thereby promoting themselves. ...more 3.5/5 stars \u25b6 Well, you're about to enter the land of the free and the brave \u25b6 Wear your coat over your arm and look as though you know where you're going \u25b6 Don't look too innocent \u25b6 Try not to look so frightened \u25b6 The only thing they can stop you for is if they think you have TB, so don't cough whatever you do \u25b6 Brooklyn changes every day \u25b6 New people arrive and they could be Jewish or Irish or Polish or even coloured.

Set in the 1950's, in a time after the second world war, this relates the story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish woman, who with the help of her older sister and a priest gets an opportunity to leave her small Irish town to seek a better life in America. In Brooklyn, New York, Eilis begins her new life as a resident in a boardinghouse owned by Mrs Kehoe. During the day she works at a department store, and at night, she attends night classes where she studies bookkeeping. It's only a matter of time before homesickness sets in, leaving Eilis feeling sad and depressed. During an Irish dance, Eilis meets Tony, an Italian plumber (don't roll your eyes, it's an honorable job.) and they fall in love. She falls in love with him. He falls in love with her. I don't know. I'm still trying to figure that part out. I'll explain later on. MY THOUGHTS The writing: The narrative style uses the third person narrative to relate the story. And you all know, I'm a bit iffy about third person narratives. The writing itself, to be honest, was just serviceable. No grandiosity to it, it wasn't resplendent neither was it awe-inspiring. It was Juuuuust serviceable. It would be paramount to note that this story isn't bubbly, and while the story is centered on romance more than anything else, the tone of the book is really calm. So calm it bordered on gloomy. I felt like the story was very disjointed. The romance was a bit speedy, don't get me wrong though, I did like it. It was sweet. But, the thing is, I watched and loved the movie adaptation SO FREAKING MUCH- and it's not just because of Saoirse Ronan(though I will watch anything she stars in). The interpretation of the book, and portrayal of the story was banshee-screaming-ear-splittingly awesome. I loved how the characters were portrayed, especially the character of Tony. So you see, I had badass expectations because of the movie, so regardless of the disjointedness of the story and serviceable writing, I had a portrait of Tony-and the other characters-to look forward to. And it carried me through the story. THE ROMANCE Like I said, it was sweet. But there was a great misbalance, or at least that's how It felt to me. So to describe Tony's character, the words that come to mind are: boyish, playful, free-spirited, flower child, sweet, cute, and did I say boyish and cute? Well put them both together and you have boyishly cute. What he lacked physically, he compensated greatly for behaviorally. And what about Eilis? Well...to be honest the only word that comes to mind is cold fish. I swear, her character was so hard for me to decipher. IS still hard for me to decipher. I think she wasn't an exerting enough character, I only liked her when she was with Tony. Never as an individual. And that is so wrong. There were so many times when I couldn't even feel her love for Tony at all. It's just like they were in love with each other at different times, and hardly ever at the same time. Hence my indecisiveness about who fell in love with who. But Tony was the one doing most of the loving, in my opinion. MY TONY. THE REAL PLOT IN 7-or more or less-LINES :D It's not all about Tony and Eilis. The truth is there are two guys involved in this story: Two guys, two countries, one girl, one choice. The truth is this story isn't just about romance: It's about finding home, discovering yourself and knowing where the little pieces that make you fit into the messed up puzzle that is life, it's about choices and the consequences of those choices, it's about being human. It's simply about humanity. Sooo about 74% gone into the book, something happens. Something that changed how I looked at Tony a little bit. I won't say what it is, but I'll tell you it has do with...bodily functions. And it left me feeling like Tony wasn't really as selfless and considerate as I thought he was. Maybe it's just the way I read it, maybe I read too much into it, maybe other people won't find a problem with that particular part. But I did. I AUTOMATICALLY WENT FROM THIS: #SWOON TO THIS Tony broke my soul. And I just couldn't look at him the same way again. I was mad, I was crushed. Let's leave it at that. THE OTHER CHARACTERS There are secondary characters who, to me, proved very important in this story. The first two are: \u2611 The priest who helped who continuously helps Eilis. \u2611 Mrs Kehoe (Eilis's landlady) These two characters would argue the saying that \"All faith in humanity is lost\". Their great display of kindness and love is so uplifting and inspiring, it can only remind you of a truth, though shadowed, is still true-humans have a great and tremendous capacity to love. Sometimes it's hard to see it, yes, but it's there. We are not unrecoverable, neither are we hopeless. That's why the characters above were the ones to whom I was greatly endeared to. I love everything they stand for, everything they represent, and they added significantly to the little satisfaction I got from this book. OTHER SECONDARY CHARACTERS (BOARDERS LIVING IN THE BOARDINGHOUSE ) Trust me, these characters' stupidity and idiocy were detrimental to the development of the story. So we must applaud them. To being moronic! SEE EVEN THE PEOPLE AT HOGWARTS ARE PLEASED \u2611 Sheila and McAdam These girls made me want to hurl. Whenever they opened their mouths, the only things that crossed my mind were AND AGAIN \u2611 Patty and Diana: (BLANK SPACE) \u2611 Miss Kelly(Eilis's devious former employer in Ireland) DO I REGRET READING THIS? SHOULD YOU READ IT? YES. FORM YOUR OWN OPINION, EXPERIENCE THE BEAUTIFUL AND ONEROUS. BUT DON'T YOU DARE STEAL MY TONY.

It glanced at the possibility of same-gender harassment by a boss, when no one else was in the facility, leading me to anticipate additional similar events or tension or conflict. No. Nothing. It glanced at the tension between Irish and Italians in Brooklyn in the 1950s, but -- again, nothing. In the interest of full disclosure, my Irish grandmother married my Italian grandfather, and they raised several kids in Brooklyn, so I've got some skin in this game. Toibin doesn't get close to explaining to the reader the views each group had of the other at that time. In the end, we spend 260 pages with a character who is largely flat - never gloriously happy, drifting into a relationship with a man who borders on too perfect, ever-patient, just. not. real. Our protagonist doesn't appear to have learned anything throughout the novel other than how to cross the Atlantic well, and how to apply make-up. And then it ends. As if a timer went off. Nothing's resolved. I enjoyed reading Brooklyn, in terms of the easiness of Toibin's prose style. But his 1950's Brooklyn isn't real to me. I am amazed someone thought there was enough here to turn into a movie; then again I understand that the movie ends differently. Not surprising, really. My 3 stars probably should be 2 stars, but Brooklyn is an easy read and deserves credit for that. So 1 extra star is for whatever magic Brooklyn has, to which I am immune. ...more It was not the most compelling or riveting book I have ever read, yet the gentle tone surrounding the story of an Irish girl settling all alone in America, with just a priest as her only contact with home, was deeply touching.

Compared to Frank McCourt's approach, this novel took the sting out of poverty and hardship and tinted the life of a young girl leaving home in the Fifties for a foreign country, with sanguine, roseate hues. The realism of her life in transition, and her efforts to adjust in both worlds - a small town in Ireland, versus the big city, New York in America - is very real. Her seasickness on board the ship heading for America is almost metaphorical. Lonelines, homesickness, combined with new opportunities and a broader exposure to more cultures, ultimately leads to unforeseen, regrettable decisions, spurred by her innocence, unworldliness and her unwillingness to take the lead. Eilise is not used to making her own decisions. Almost apathetically, she floats from one person's idea of how her life should be lived to another, until she finally has to stand up and take over the wheel of her destiny with some secret regrets that will remain with her for the rest of her life. Brooklyn is an inspirational story, a cozy read, if you value the romantic influences of Irish roses. Sometimes they are hauntingly beautiful indeed... ...more Eilis lives in a small Irish village in the early 1950s with her sister and widowed mother.

When she meets a handsome, cheerful, Italian man who genuinely cares for her, Eilis seems to just fall into the relationship. Their relationship and her bookkeeping courses fill her time so she feels less homesick for Ireland. When a family tragedy occurs, Eilis is called back to Ireland. She gets into a comfortable routine with her old friends who admire her new American clothes and hairstyle, and feel her new confidence. Eilis has roots in Ireland, but now also has opportunities and obligations in America. Is she going to make her own choices, or will other people and circumstances make the choice for her? Along with the usual coming-of-age challenges, Eilis was also trying to find out where she wanted to call home. I especially liked the author's use of local color in Ireland, on the ship crossing the Atlantic, and various places in New York such as Coney Island and a Brooklyn Dodgers game. He did a great job of imagining 1950s New York. I often wondered how many emotions Eilis was hiding below the surface and wished I could see more into her mind, especially at the end of the book. 3.5 stars. 6/25/16 I loved the film, and felt it stayed true to the spirit of the story.

I own a bunch of Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn (I purchased this, The Master , The Story of the Night , The South , etc., right before we went to Ireland last year, but ended up reading another couple Irish writers*). Anywho, my wife read it, and since our reading venn diagram has a very narrow overlap, I jumped at the chance to read it after she finished just to have a common book to talk to her about. Finally, I read this because I saw the movie with my wife and liked it (the screenplay was adapted by Nick Hornby , which going in with no hints or trailers was a good sign). With all that in mind, I figured I might as well start my T\u00f3ib\u00edn journey here. It wasn't a perfect novel, but WAS a near perfect example of immigrant fiction. The arc of the story and the characters are almost perfectly rendered. It was longlisted for the Man Booker in 2009.

For one who grew up in the south east of Ireland in the 1950-60s it transported me back to many familiar sights, sounds, smells and moments \u2013 with uncanny accuracy. The delectation is in the detail and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, a native of Enniscorthy where the book is partly set, has his details spot on. Mrs Kelly\u2019s shop, the Sunday night dance, early Mass, the Courtown Hotel, Curracloe and Ballyconnigar strand all evoke vivid memories. The petty snobbery, importance of appearances, and the social catastrophe of mass forced emigration are captured with a light touch, without anything actually being said about them. Indeed it is the absence of saying anything about anything important that is probably the salient impression I take from the novel. Real issues are never discussed openly by the main characters or sometimes not at all. We Irish are masters at skirting the subject, dropping hints, making snide comments, raising an eyebrow to deliver a message but rarely are we ones for coming out in the open, addressing an issue up-front. We are certainly better than we were but the old ways of buttoned-up silent emotions that T\u00f3ib\u00edn lays out brilliantly remains our default stance. What is exceptional about the main character Eil\u00eds Lacey is that she is endowed with heightened intuition for a young woman of her age and time. She can see into and beyond what people say to what they are thinking and feeling and her capacity for discernment is breathtaking. Her poise and manner set her apart but her inability to freely express her own inner emotions eventually is her undoing. Denial runs through these pages as a leitmotif. Eil\u00eds\u2019s recently dead father is hardly mentioned, the harrowing feelings of everyone concerned at her departure for America (including her own) and other later events are never expressed, tears are shed in private, major issues are avoided or left to simmer, letters are written without crucial content, joy, love, ecstasy are barely acknowledged. T\u00f3ib\u00edn has illustrated an innate Irish ethnic trait in the most subtle yet damming way \u2013 by slowly and painstakingly unearthing its essence while never actually naming it. He learned his manners well in Enniscorthy. The other themes of the book for me are emigration and women. The experience of a houseful of Irish emigrants in Brooklyn is brilliantly portrayed but it could be mirrored by similar groups in any part of England at the time, except for the particular constraints imposed by the distance from home. Lack of education meant limited opportunity and the Irish tended to huddle together for support and comfort. The beneficent influence of the Catholic Church gets its due as a bulwark of strength in a somewhat hostile environment. What is absent is any sense of frustration, anger or betrayal that this should be the lot of these young people \u2013 deserted by a nation pledged to cherish them. And that too is authentic. It is only in recent times that Irish people have moved beyond mute acceptance of forced mass emigration and started to ask the why questions. Apart from Fr Flood who helps Eil\u00eds in Brooklyn there is hardly another major male character. T\u00f3ib\u00edn has a sub-plot here as well I suspect. In the official Ireland of government, news, church, and commerce it was only men who were seen or heard. Women were confined behind the lace curtains but that did not diminish their power exercised in ways that men neither understood nor felt. This is a hymn of praise to Irish women of that era who did not merely suffer in silence but rose above it to act with dignity, sense, courage and humility as beautifully revealed in the portraits of Eil\u00eds, her mother and her sister Rose. For accuracy sake the narrow mindedness and cruelty of other women is there too in Mrs Kelly and Mrs Kehoe but their parts merely serve to highlight the heroism of the Lacey women. Like many mothers and daughters of their time duty was what counted \u2013 knowing it and doing it come what may\u2014and never letting the side down. The book left me with much to remember and much to regret. As I wallowed in the nostalgia T\u00f3ib\u00edn craftily created I began to become uneasy and a sense of foreboding accompanied every page turn. As Eil\u00eds got happier I become more alert, more aware of impending doom. In that older Ireland joy was not just fleeting it was distrusted and discouraged. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon get your comeuppance me boyo!\u201d And just on cue T\u00f3ib\u00edn brought me down to earth\u2014but bless him\u2014he didn\u2019t leave me totally devastated at the end. ...more A beautiful story, a careful, slow build of character.

Impeccable writing - spare, intense, precise. Deceptively simple at the sentence level; yet so perfectly matched to the character Toibin is creating and the story he is telling. This writing is stunning in its simplicity and its power. Eilis is a wonderful protagonist, whose inner conflicts are shown through her experiences. At the same time, Toibin takes us into her head and lets us see how she works through major decision points. And it's the many choices that Eilis makes that propel this plot forward. It's the people she encounters along the way - how they help or hinder her - and what that reveals about the journey (physical, emotional) she is experiencing. Toibin shows us Eilis's world as an individual story - but a representative one, too. It's the world of an Irish emigrant to Brooklyn in the 50s - within two contexts: the one she is leaving, and the one she is entering. We are rooting for her all the way. We expect - at least, I expected - trauma at every turn of the page. Grand drama, lots of drinking, grinding poverty and the gruelling process of escape from it. So, way to set my expectations - stereotypes - on their head, Mr. Toibin. No annoying exposition - just scene after brilliantly-constructed scene that reveal character (her own and others) and themes. Gentle, kind, humane. Even the characters with petty jealousies and meanness, narrowness of views and outright racism - are presented with compassion. Lovely parallels (Mrs. Kelly and Ms. Fortini - two shopkeepers: one mean, narrow and spiteful; and the other progressive, compassionate albeit not effusive, professional - the old and new worlds. They don't collide - they just stand as parallels. One being left behind, and one forging ahead, tottering toward the future on newborn-foal legs, and with the same courage). We do not blame Mrs. Kelly - we recognize that she is from a time and that time is being left behind. Progress, evolution is occurring - embodied in Eilis' journey and metaphorically, through the emigrant experience in general. I especially loved the way the immigrant/emigrant experience was presented in the duality of personality that Eilis came to feel, which made her choice - at the end - all the more wrenching. The scene of the two black women buying stockings (colour: Red Fox) where Eilis works - and where she has been hand-picked to serve this new `target market` - is masterful. The details -- Red Fox stockings, set aside on a separate table in a separate part of the store ( \"When the new colours of Coffee and Sepia came it was her job to point out to the customers that these were lighter colours but most of them ignored her. By the end of each of these days she felt exhausted and found her lectures in the evening almost relaxing, relieved that there was something to take her mind off the fierce tension in the store, which lay heaviest around her counter.\" p. 117) -- so subtle, yet with such massive impact. You feel this writing, more than read it. The cast-down eyes, the quietness that falls upon the bustling store as the shoppers enter, the careful acceptance of their money and provision of their change. There are all kinds of these moments of built-up tension, not actually released, conveyed and capped off, in this scene, by Eilis's own neutral observation and question ( \"She wished she had not been singled out to stand at this counter and wondered if, in time, she would be moved to another part of the store.\" ). If for no other reason, read this book for this scene. A great priest. A great love story - two, in fact. A must-read. More Toibin is going on my list IMMEDIATELY. Thank you to David Giltinan, whose review prompted me to put this on my list in the first place; and Trevor`s , which reminded me it was there and got me to finally buy it. ...more Zoe Heller said Brooklyn was the most compelling and moving portrait of a young woman she has read in a long time and though I\u2019d give that accolade to the narrator of A Girl is a Half Formed Thing there is much that\u2019s moving and compelling in this novel.

In fact it\u2019s hard to fault except perhaps to say that it\u2019s composed on a small canvas and so lacks the breadth of a truly thrilling and first rate novel. Basically it\u2019s a concise and artful study of the sensibility of a young girl who suddenly finds herself uprooted - a young Irish girl, Eilis who, faced with a lack of opportunities at home, is encouraged by her sister to emigrate alone to Brooklyn. The prose is simple and lucid \u2013 never straying into linguistic territory the protagonist herself would be incapable of formulating. Eilis herself is both easily pleased and fickle. She appears to suffer from a lack of imagination which means ultimately she will always choose the pragmatic option. And this becomes a novel about how easily we are ensnared by fate, or rather, how casually we can make fateful decisions and are then ensnared by one narrative at the expense of the alternatives. I tend to favour writers who are capable of formulating sentences beyond my own capabilities, who can enliven the world with feats of linguistic artistry and there is no such writing in Brooklyn for which I\u2019m going to be a bit stingy with my stars. Immensely charming though it is Brooklyn ultimately is more of a paddle than a swim. ...more Brooklyn tells the tale of a young Irish girl named Eilis who, unable to find suitable work, leaves her home behind her for the opportunities that America, and in particular Brooklyn, has to offer. \u201cShe was nobody here.

The rooms in the house on Friary Street belonged to her, she thought; when she moved in them she was really there. In the town, if she walked to the shop or to the Vocational School, the air, the light, the ground, it was all solid and part of her, even if she met no one familiar. Nothing here was part of her. It was false, empty, she thought. She closed her eyes and tried to think, as she had done so many times in her life, of something she was looking forward to, but there was nothing. Not the slightest thing. Not even Sunday. Nothing maybe except sleep, and she was not even certain she was looking forward to sleep\u201d This is a very quiet and subtle book. Eilis, the lead character, is extremely passive. She is not the feisty, badass heroine that so many other books try to write young women to be. She is reserved and noncommittal, never quite saying what it is she is truly feeling. But that is the beauty of 'Brooklyn' , Eilis does not know how to give herself truly to anything; she does not yet know how she feels about life. So often her decisions have been made for her\u2026including the decision for her to move to America. That was decided by her family and the priest. And she just willingly accepted her fate\u2026 And yet I really liked Eilis. Okay at times I did want to almost shake her into making her mind up\u2026 especially when it came to her romantic interests\u2026 but that transition period from being under a parent\u2019s wing to making decisions about your long term future is not easy. And I think it was beautifully handled. \u201cUntil now, Eilis had always presumed that she would live in the town all her life, as her mother had done, knowing everyone, having the same friends and neighbours, the same routines in the same streets. She had expected that she would find a job in the town, and then marry someone and give up the job and have children.\u201d I really enjoyed Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s writing style. It felt familiar; like home. His turn of phrase, expressions used\u2026 they were simple yet beautiful. The characters spoke my language, they phrased things how I hear them phrased every day\u2026 yet it was all so very quiet, and so very understated. I don\u2019t often enjoy reading books by Irish authors; I tend to get overly critical of how they are portraying my beautiful homeland to the world at large\u2026 Yet this time I was happy! There were no clich\u00e9d descriptions of rolling mists or mossy this or thats\u2026. okay yes, we have all that here\u2026 (You want green? We have got A LOT of green!!!) But this time it didn\u2019t feel like some tourist board advertisement, the descriptions of Enniscorthy town, of the surrounding Wexford countryside\u2026 it all felt more authentic, tangible. Okay I\u2019m intimately familiar with all things Wexford so I\u2019m sure that influenced me but I really felt he captured an authentic snapshot of what life was like in 1950s Ireland. Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn himself is from Enniscorthy and you could really feel his gr\u00e1 (love) for his hometown in how he wrote Eilis. And then when the action of the novel moved to America it felt very real too... I loved the idiosyncratic on-goings of the characters in the boarding house in which Eilis lived. I very much enjoyed reading about her experiences at work, her studies\u2026 In Brooklyn Eilis met a boy\u2026 this wasn\u2019t some fiery, passionate romance\u2026 that wouldn\u2019t be very \u2018Eilis\u2019. Theirs was a love story that perhaps burned brighter for one over the other\u2026 It was all so quietly written about. Normally I like a book to have characters with lots of depth and lots of backstory\u2026 We didn\u2019t really get that in this book\u2026 and that wasn\u2019t a bad thing! It just further illustrated the isolation and loneliness that was experienced by young women like Eilis who moved to America in the 1950s\u2026 How being in America changed you, made you different to those left behind at home. It is a story that members of my own extended family could relate to you. I very much enjoyed reading this book. So much so that I stayed awake into the wee small hours of the morning reading it. It is a very easy and calming read. It is not a book for those of you who love action and adventure; it probably is not even a book for those of you who love only romance\u2026 but it is a book for those of you who like a quieter more gentle type of read. four stars \u201cNone of them could help her. She had lost all of them. They would not find out about this; she would not put it into a letter. And because of this she understood that they would never know her now.

It was heartbreaking at times, because we've all felt homesickness and inability to cope, but Tobin is especially good at letting his characters work things out on their own. There was almost unbearable suspense for me at the end, because of the choices she had to make. I knew what I wanted for her, but I couldn't be of much help, except to root for her happiness. It was a beautiful ending, but also bittersweet. I notice from reviews that opinions are widely varying on this one, but it's one of my favorite books so far in 2016. ...more Quick read and better than I thought.

The simplicity is deceptive, though. \"Brooklyn\" is not simplistic at all, but rather a complex, tender, and often frustratingly human portrait of a young woman struggling to find a place for herself -- a place that teeters precariously between her parochial Irish upbringing and that of her new home in the ethnically diverse, yet racially-strained world of post-WWII Brooklyn. ...more 2.5 I expected much more from this story than what I received.
