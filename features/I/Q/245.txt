I just finished this book and wanted to come write about it immediately so I don't forget how it made me feel. First off, the language is beautiful and so fitting for the context. The two girls--Snow Flower and Lily--have a friendship that is beautiful and is fun to pick out little pieces from my own childhood/current friendships that I recognize and adore. My next thoughts are not necessarily critiques of the book, but of the way the Chinese thought: I had a real problem with hearing over and over how worthless a woman is if she cannot produce a son. If that were still the case, I would be as worthless as they come. It bothered me that daughters were considered better off if they died than to live. And I thought Lily perpetuated that as unfeeling as the patriarchs who instilled that thought process to begin with. And don't get me started on footbinding. I know this is a cultural thing that I cannot begin to comprehend (such as people who think that is just the way life is,<---M> but still</---M>, how could they not think this through?) I mean, one of of ten girls died from footbinding. And not only does it make the foot look grotesque (which they thought was beautiful) but they were practically crippled for the rest of their lives. They had to be carried most distances after the age of six.<---F> It's simply ridiculous</---F>. But reading this book made me want to learn to embroider. I know it sounds ridiculous but I was actually looking for embroidery classes in the area where I could learn how to do it. And I want to do it with my daughter. The visual of these women embroidering together. It's just beautiful. There were so many beautiful quotes that I thought I'd list my favorites: This thought is a real comfort to me: \"Everyone knows that part of the spirit descends to the afterworld, while part of it remains with the family, but we have a special belief about the spirit of a young woman who has died before her marriage that goes contrary to this. She comes back to prey upon other unmarried girls--not to scare them but to take them to the afterworld with her so she might have company.\" This is particarly interesting to me because after my daughter died, Biance would tell me about going to heaven with Miranda every night while she dreamed. Another quote I liked about teachers: \"The classics tell us that, in relationships, the one between teacher and student comes second only to the one between parent and child.\" The last one is a bit lengthy, but I like it nonetheless: \"If it is perfectly acceptable for a widow to disfigure herself or commit suicide to save face for her husband's family, why should a mother not be moved to extreme action by the loss of a child or children? We are their caretakers. We love them. We nurse them when they are sick. . . But no woman should live longer than her children. It is against the law of nature. If she does, why wouldn't she wish to leap from a cliff, hang from a branch, or swallow lye?\" Overall, this was a sad, beautiful book. ...more I had high hopes for this book, but ended up feeling deflated and disappointed. Two aspects of the book were interesting: descriptions of the practice of Chinese footbinding, and an exploration of 'nu shu,' the written language Chinese women developed to communicate exclusively with each other. Unfortunately, the book also has two major problems: a boring story, and the use of cheap gimmicks instead of complex characterization.

Unfortunately, the book also has two major problems: a boring story, and the use of cheap gimmicks instead of complex characterization. The story deals with two girls who are matched as 'old sames,' sort of a best-girlfriend relationship that is meant to last for life. Unfortunately, the story of their friendship is just not compelling, and I kept feeling like the author missed the opportunity to tell a really interesting story within the context of the world she creates. Aside from being boring (the worst sin in fiction) I was also disappointed with the way she handled the intimacy of the friendship between the two women, using what I call the 'cheap and easy Hollywood method for showing intimacy.' In other words, she introduces sexual elements to show us just how 'close' these two women really are, rather than really taking us inside the complex world that is the relationship between two best girlfriends. I thought it was a really shallow treatment of a very deep subject. It was hugely disappointing. I don't recommend it. ...more My grandmother used to say that my big feet meant I had a \u201cgood foundation.\u201d I\u2019d stare longingly at her size-six feet when she said this and curse my genetic inheritance from elsewhere in the family tree.

Then I had an ex-boyfriend make the infuriating statement that rich women have small feet. I pointed out that his celebrity crush, Paris Hilton (yeah, another reason I dumped him) has huge size-eleven feet. My teenage-self took a lot of comfort in the fact that foot size is pre-ordained and unchangeable. Clown-sized feet can strike the smart, the rich, the beautiful. And there isn\u2019t a damned thing they or I could do about it. Then I read this book and learn it is possible to change your foot size. It\u2019s called foot binding. And you know what? I\u2019ll pass. I enjoy being able to wiggle my toes and jump around. So, thank you, <---A>Lisa See</---A>! For once in my life, I am content with my big feet. And I owe it all to your graphic descriptions of this ancient Chinese method. Blood, putrefaction, pain, breaking bones, risk of death! I cannot believe those women were subjected to such brutal mutilation for the sake of beauty. Then they were still expected to clean the house perched on those tiny, unstable feet. The foot binding portion of the book was the highlight for me. The inspiration for the book was nu shu , a written language developed by Chinese women and kept secret from men for hundreds of years. Yawn. I didn\u2019t find that part of the story very compelling or even believable. Didn\u2019t men wonder why the ladies kept ink and brushes in their room? Beyond the foot biding event and nu shu device, this was really a story about a female friendship that was deep and even erotic at times. Putting aside any problems with the plot, their emotions toward each other were complex and meaningful. There was hope and joy, but mostly there was pain. During an event with Lisa last night, she spoke of how depressing writing can be. She doesn\u2019t always wake up raring to write. Instead she may dread knowing she has to go to a dark, internal place to write about a character\u2019s death or betrayal. Even worse, she may have to stay in that mindset for days or weeks until that section is completely written. I spend so much time glamorizing a writer\u2019s lifestyle that I had not fully considered how emotionally draining it could be. I suspected the career engenders self-doubt. \u201cWill people like what I\u2019ve written?\u201d Yet, I had never thought about the struggle Lisa described to create and inhabit the internal emotional environment necessary to produce the actual words. I commend Lisa for giving us a realistic look at the treatment of and expectations for women in that day and age. Women were isolated and undervalued. Their worth was determined solely by whether they could produce sons. But honestly, my main complaint about the book is how depressing it was. I kept waiting for some great act of heroism. Yet the women stuck to their traditional roles. The main character not only repeated the indoctrination, she believed it! \u201cMy role in life is to obey, obey, obey.\u201d Sure, they rebelled in small ways, but always within the confines of their societal roles. I kept routing for one character to leave an abusive husband or, at very least, stand up to her oppressive mother-in-law. Normally I criticize authors for deviating from historical facts in order to cater to a modern readership. This time, I think Lisa stayed so true to the setting that she turned me off. (And her heavy-handed foreshadowing didn\u2019t help.) Life was hard for women back then. I get it. But does that make for an enjoyable read? Not really. And I think that was my problem. I had the wrong expectations as I entered this book. It wasn't a sprawling historical epic, filled with exciting action, heart-fluttering romance, and distant voyages like Shogun (one of the few other historical fictions I have read that are set in Asia). It was a largely quiet book about quiet life. Lisa herself admitted she writes sad books. And when she started this book, no one thought it would be successful. China? Women? Gloom? No one will read that! Well, she proved them wrong. Lots of people read it. Heck, I read it. Even more people will probably see the movie. And it\u2019s worth reading. It made me appreciate the freedom women enjoy today, as well as the potential depth of female friendship. Not to mention, I\u2019m looking down at my feet right now and thinking, \u201chell yeah, that\u2019s one beautiful, ergonomic piece of evolution \u2013 and just the right size.\" ...more An Excellent Choice for Book Clubs I had a hard time putting down this book and felt utterly transported to a village in the Hunan province in central south China during the early to mid-nineteenth century. The narrator, 80-year-old Lily, who refers to herself as one who has \"yet to die,\" tells the story of her life. She has outlived her family members and relates the story of her formative years--and her relationship with another woman, Snow Flower. This well written tale is related with clarity An Excellent Choice for Book Clubs I had a hard time putting down this book and felt utterly transported to a village in the Hunan province in central south China during the early to mid-nineteenth century. The narrator, 80-year-old Lily, who refers to herself as one who has \"yet to die,\" tells the story of her life. She has outlived her family members and relates the story of her formative years--and her relationship with another woman, Snow Flower. This well written tale is related with clarity, sentiment, and most poignantly, remorse. It's through remorse that the reader comes to know the true character of Lily, as she reflects upon a misunderstanding she had with her one true love. Beyond the reflection of Lily's relationship with Snow Flower, a girl she meets at the age of six when they are introduced by the local matchmaker and tied by contract to forever be known as \"laotongs,\" or \"old sames,\" this story provides a lesson in Chinese history and culture. Many have heard of the tradition of feet binding, but through Lisa See's writing, one experiences the excruciating pain and the meaning behind a mother's duty to bind her \"worthless\" daughters' feet. It's all about marriage and, of course, sex. At once I went to the Internet to look for images of bound feet because I had a terribly hard time visualizing a foot only seven centimeters in length. I enjoyed every minute of reading this story and I highly recommend it. I think it would make an excellent selection for book clubs, given the vast number of elements to spark topics of conversation: Chinese culture--past and present; Mother-daughter relationships; Foot-binding; Arranged marriage; Female relationships; Lesbian relationships (?); Chinese history; Chinese foods; Chinese geography, etc. ...more \"For my entire life I longed for love.

I adore historical fiction that can really immerse me in another time and place and <+++>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</+++> did just that. Transported back to 19th century China, I believe I arrived at a better understanding of a woman's position in this society. I learned what it was like to be a daughter, a sister, a wife and a daughter-in-law. I am admittedly grateful for not ever having to experience these often overwhelmingly harsh relationships in the way that these women did! Not for an instant can I imagine having to yearn for my mother's love with the feeling that it was something impossible to attain. And, I most certainly could not fathom bending to my mother-in-law's every command and needing to act as a lowly \"visitor\" in her home even as the wife of her own son. The cultural practice of footbinding was truly horrific and cringeworthy. If you, like me, decide to google any images, please consider yourself forewarned that it really does look as awful and disfiguring as you would no doubt imagine. Yet, a young girl's future and her marriageability depended heavily on the result of this archaic practice. The one relationship that I found endearing and one that transcends both time and culture is that of a true friendship. This is so beautifully demonstrated in the bond between the narrator, Lily, and Snow Flower, her \"old same\". Lisa See really brings to life the nuances of their lifelong friendship which began as little girls with a contract sealing their fates in a laotong relationship. \"A laotong match is as significant as a good marriage\u2026 A laotong relationship is made by choice for the purpose of emotional companionship and eternal fidelity. A marriage is not made by choice and has only one purpose \u2013 to have sons.\" We see the girls grow up together and experience the joys of childhood friendship \u2013 laughing, dreaming, and mourning together. The women's secret form of writing, or nu shu, begins with the communication between the little girls on the folds of a special fan that will provide a chronicle of their extraordinary relationship throughout their lives. As married women, they experience both the happiness and the sorrow of giving birth and living under the heavy thumbs of their husbands and mothers-in-law in households that scorn rather than cherish them. And, as with some friendships, these women experience the differences in social standings within a community and suffer from misunderstandings and ultimate betrayal. Can a friendship really withstand anything? This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the culture of China during this period and those that enjoy reading about the various connections between women. If you've ever had a true friend, this book will truly speak to you and perhaps make you just a tad nostalgic about the carefree days when you could hope and giggle with your own \"bestie\". \uf04a ...more I tried to read it.

I doubt there's a director (still) alive brave enough to make a film of that book. ...more I ended up enjoying this book because it was so beautifully written and it took me deep into a world so unlike my own; thank goodness for that! This story takes place in China\u2019s Hunan Province in the 1800s and is more about the inner lives of the women than the men. I had a complete misconception of what foot binding entailed.

It\u2019s completely different, and so much more brutal a practice than I ever could have imagined. There were also many examples given of what I consider other horrendous customs and beliefs. I\u2019ve always believed that tradition and culture that harms is not worth preserving and reading about these people\u2019s lives was a painful experience. The story is fiction but well researched so I\u2019m assuming there was much truth about how women led their lives in that time and place. I was able to feel some empathy for the storywriter, because I could understand her longing to be loved and the difficulties she had in her upbringing that formed her personality, even though I sometimes had a hard time liking her and many of the characters. I was also irritated by so much of the book. I loathe stories where there\u2019s a horrible miscommunication or misunderstanding that seems so unnecessary, and there\u2019s an example of that here. Also, throughout the book, the narrator is writing the story of her life for another/others in her culture to read, yet the whole time I felt she was educating us in our time & places. So frequently the line \u201cas you know\u201d or \u201cas everyone knows\u201d is used to start a sentence, and I just kept thinking that if everyone knows it the narrator wouldn\u2019t need to say it in that way. The narrator also most of the way through the book alludes to something she\u2019s going to tell the reader and it got to the point where, instead of following along with the story, I just wanted to see what she was going to reveal. I think that it\u2019s worth it to read the paperback copy because of Lisa See\u2019s notes at the end about the writing of this book,. Perhaps they were there in the hardcover version as well, but often additions such as this aren\u2019t there at publication of the hardcover edition. Also, the paperback has some discussion questions at the end which might come in handy as I read this book for my book club. The plot & characters did make me think about however women are regarded and what is considered beautiful in various cultures, including our own, can powerfully influence women\u2019s lives. And they also highlight how our various expectations of ourselves and others imposed by our societies can influence human beings. It also made me think a lot about the corrosive power of unresolved anger and trauma. ...more This has got to be one of the most beautiful, yet heartbreaking books that I have ever read. The subject matter is horrific but the story is truly engaging. The main storyline in this book is about the horrible patriarchal practise, foot-binding, that took place in China in the past.

I would like to know who decided that 7 centimetre-long feet were \u201csexy.\u201d The obsession with feet truly perplexed me; how could young men know nothing about their future betrothed wives except what size their feet were? Obviously foot-binding was a practice to control women, which was a point I made to a feminist I was talking to when a man suddenly interrupted our conversation and accused us of waging a war against men! Also, it\u2019s so sad how culturally women were undervalued in Chinese society. They suffered so much abuse and, from a very young age, they were cultivated for marriage because, after all, all women were good for was for giving birth to sons. Everything they did was to prepare them for marriage yet when they eventually married their in-laws weren\u2019t even satisfied and everyone was miserable. What\u2019s the point? Excuse my sarcastic tone but I cannot wrap my head around how awful this part of Chinese history is. Instead of protecting women in society, women were made to feel worthless and their lives are also put into peril. It was truly heartbreaking. Lisa See brilliantly captured the reality of Chinese life in the past. I also thought that part of the book about the laotang and sisterhood was lovely, as well as the parts about the secret writing, and the art of storytelling. Definitely a great book but not one that I\u2019d ever read again, it\u2019s too distressing. ...more I actually wavered between giving this book a rating of 3 or 4 stars. This is not because Lisa See was unable to portray the life in this feudal Chinese society well, because much of this was vivid and interesting. The oppression of women, including the horrors of footbinding, isolation and servitude to men and one's in-laws were all clearly and often dismayingly illustrated.

One problem with this novel is how much better the tale could have been related if written in the third person, rather than the use of Lily as narrator. After learning throughout this book that she was a sensitive, caring, pledged lifelong friend; she becomes a cruel,selfish and judgemental harridan to Snow Flower. These very factors were so antithetical to what was supposed to have been developed between these two women and what they had always professed would be their relationship, that it was difficult to continue the reading with the same attitude of enjoyment and appreciation. I often found that See did not work hard enough to develop either her plot lines or her characters. She often glossed over some segments, seemingly in order to reach her next period of time. Despite these criticisms, I found this book often compelling with a level of anticipation for the reader. ...more My book club was more interested in talking about their trips to China than See's book.

No phrase or passage noteworthy for its beauty or addition to literature. I was fascinated, however, by the potential for beautiful prose but lists just don't do that for me. The publisher's missed an opportunity to replicate the secret fan from See's clues - would have been a bonus. The dynamics of the women's relationships were fascinating, reminiscent of The Joy Luck Club . I sorrowed at the footbound therefore dutybound therefore ironbound feminine mind. Why did See not correlate the inter-relationship between body, mind and spirit? The bound feet reflected the bounded mind, bound by the society, filtered by necessity through the mother-jailers also prisoners of the system. Still, I longed for Lily of the Golden Lilies to recognize that with her smart thinking she had the ability to lessen Snow Flower's burden, a bit of rice here, some smuggled cloth there, cash , quilts. I even thought Snow Flower could have been brought in as a concubine. Lots of juicy plot possibility there. And I wonder at the morality of the wealthy women who could cast out her beloved friend without a hearing. To publicly humiliate an already humiliated person who had everything to lose from the shunning while Lily had won only an egoist's victory. And lost the one who loved her most in the ego-frenzy. Conversation over tea, sitting in the innner room and sugar-crackled tofu would on the other hand not have served See's plot. Hard to read while the Chinese government was strong-arming Tibet. The mental foot binding continues - not only in China of course. ...more Ever since reading Memoirs of a Geisha, I've been looking for a book that will let me relive that excitement. So I was hoping that Snow Flower and the Secret Fan would fit the bill for my craving for Asian drama :) I would have to say that this book did not.

I found it difficult to get invested in the characters who seemed somewhat flat to me. The narrator wasn't engaging enough to make me feel a connection to her. Really, the strength of the book in my opinion was the detail it spent in developing an understanding of the cultural issues surrounding Chinese women and the custom of footbinding. Which, of course, is horrible mutilation to a woman living in the 21st century Western world, but was the very epitome of beauty and sexual turn-on for 19th century Chinese. So I would say it gets an A+ for effectively fleshing out that cultural way of life, but probably just a \"B-\" for characters. I wanted to care more about them than I did, but when the book was over, I was more interested in Googling pictures of bound feet than mourning the loss of their friendship and the misunderstandings that undid the two main characters. ...more \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0631\u0628\u0627\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062f\u0627\u0642\u0629

I haven\u2019t read anything this deeply affecting for quite a while {at least on the level of love and relationships}. I was hooked from the beginning. And the grace and depth of Lisa See\u2019s storytelling had me contemplating about life and the deeds and the choices we make concerning our own lives, those that are made on our behalf and how all these affects those who we most cherish. Fate. Is it something nature, or us, or others, or some higher power design for us? Is it really predestined, as these girls were made to believe? Ever since that first message that Snow Flower send little Lily, when they were just children, the stage was set for what was meant to be a lifetime of friendship. As events unfold, as life happens, an absolutely heartbreaking and unforgettable story is woven. It also reminded me of Adichie\u2019s the danger of a single story \u2013 given that I recently read The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck, where I was first introduced to the Chinese practice of foot binding. From what I\u2019ve gathered from this book, it loosely equates to Female Genital Mutilation, which until recently has been widely practiced here in Africa. And what a cruel thing it is \u2013 girls so young stand the risk of actually dying in the process, like happened to Lily\u2019s sister. Lisa, however, goes beyond this, which she has offered in an heartfelt detail, to other aspects of the Chinese culture \u2013 especially those that of concern to women. Quite fascinating is the issue of nu shu, one of the central themes, which is described as the women\u2019s secret writing. Under all that isolation and oppression that these women suffered, it is a wonderful thing that they invented a secret code/language/writting in which they could communicate in secret, offer and share comfort. Lisa See\u2019s narrative is beautiful, and from the writing itself you may discern a depth that arises not only from research and writing talent, but from the heart of a writer who knows the matters of the heart. From her\u2019s to all others that will come across this wonderfully crafted, deeply felt work of fiction. It is an amazing lesson on friendship too, and of course \u2013 that deep heart love. ...more uuughughghghghg ugh ugh ugh. i can't read about foot binding anymore. it literally makes me sick to my stomach. this is mostly due to a 15 minute video displayed twice every hour in a small missionary museum in new mexico. the sole purpose of this museum, for reasons i still can't explain, was to display unusual world practices encountered by missionaries around the globe, throughout history. my parents, wishing to enliven and culture my young and spongelike brain, (and also having nothing else t uuughughghghghg ugh ugh ugh. i can't read about foot binding anymore. it literally makes me sick to my stomach. this is mostly due to a 15 minute video displayed twice every hour in a small missionary museum in new mexico. the sole purpose of this museum, for reasons i still can't explain, was to display unusual world practices encountered by missionaries around the globe, throughout history. my parents, wishing to enliven and culture my young and spongelike brain, (and also having nothing else to entertain me with as the entire state of new mexico is boring as all get out to drive through and so damn hot you can't even sit on the grass at the rest stops) set me free in this twisted little house for 2 hours when i was eight. it was full of fun things, like pictures of kayan woman proudly displaying their neck rings, and the perfume pouches french royalty wore to ward off fleas and lice, and examples of poisoned darts that papa new guinea tribes used to hunt down white explorers in the 1700's... yay! And it also had this little dark room, with cute little chairs just my size, and teensy little brocade shoes just outside the entrance. and everybody loves teensy shoes, people. do you blame me for being fascinated? the guy in the video, however, scary. he was fat, balding, and holding a little model of a foot's skeleton just the size of my own. he used this to show how a woman's foot would be wrapped in anceint china, to press the ball of the foot towards the heel. and then he actually pressed. slowly. until the bones snapped and the ball and heel were touching. and then someone in the production process must have decided this wasn't realistic enough, so they had this cute little asian-girl actress come out and demonstrate, through blurry lens shots and muted screams, what this procedure might have felt like. when they found me later i was hypnotized, sitting with my feet tucked under my butt clutching the toes of my tennis shoes. now, like many of you goodreads devotees, i had an overactive imagination as a child. i spent a good deal of time after that experience imaging what i would do if i grew up in that time period. you know, how i would escape. because of course i had to escape. can you imagine what that would feel like? but people would find me! and hold me down! or the emperor would catch me and chop off my head! there was no escape! lots of girls would have to do it! or did it! augh! it must have been HORRIBLE for them! HORRIBLE! AUGHHH! ...consequently, i decided that to make myself feel better about the 50 majillion little asian girls a long time ago, i would just pretend that foot binding never happened. just, like, stick to american girl novels and the occasional \"dear america\" journal (medieval europe only though) till i was 12. or, you know, longer. and that's worked out pretty good for me, until this book. ms. see does a pretty amazing job resurrecting all those horribly emphatic feelings. her characters are fleshed out so well that it's hard not to see and feel through them. and even though the story is beautiful, there's a lot of history in there to see and feel. This is not like \"Sex and the Zhejiang Province\", or those awesome soap operas out of Shanghai recently where everybody runs around an ancient chinese palace set waving fans and giggling and pouring tea and crying and having babies and being banished and what not. Every main character in \"Snow Flower\" pretty much gets crapped upon continuously throughout their lives until they get too old to negotiate their way higher on the social food chain and just sit back and let their grandkids take care of them. Or you know, die. (NOT A SPOILER! Don't even try.) which is basically awesome. definitely my kind of realistic, historical novel. i'm just warning everybody... don't wiki it. don't. you don't need to see the x-rays. because they're gonna stick with you, in tiny little grotesque foot nightmares. and you'll be stuck, for the rest of the book, pretending foot binding means everyone got to wear pretty tube socks in bright colors. ...more Lisa See never disappoints me, and I loved my experience reading \"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\".

Lisa See brings to life a world that has long been gone, the landscape and food of 19th century China are reborn in Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. The setting of the book, and the imagery all add to the emotional rollercoaster you experience in this book. You also get a first hand understanding of the culture Lily and Snow Flower grow up in. The only thing that these women were expected to do was learn to cook and clean, obey their mother, father and older brothers. They were also expected to marry, with a guy that the family thought would be proper. They were also expected to get their \u2018foot binding\u2019 when they were six years old. They had no free will, and were not encouraged to think about anything other than caring for the home, children, and satisfying their husband. Lily and Snow Flower were lucky to be laotong, or \u201cold same.\u201d Lily and Snow Flower also had the privilege to learn the language that had been made by women for women in Chain, a way to communicate with each other without the men knowing what was being said. The language was known as nu sh. Lily and Snow Flower are destined to be friends, but they become sister, and as we know sisters have fights, but for Lily her ignorance leads to her to become prideful. But if you wish to know more about the life of Lily and Snow Flower you must read this book, it will make you smile and cry, but it will give you a sample of the incredible life of women in 19th century China. ...more She was also pointing out my defects and teaching me how to use them to my benefit. In our country, we call this type of mother love teng ai. My son has told me that in men's writing it is composed of two characters. The first means pain; the second means love.

That is a mother's love. 3.5 stars. A beautifully written book about the relationship between women in China. I've read a few historical fiction titles with China as the setting, but have never felt that I got such a thorough look at their culture - especially at the inner (woman's) realm. The Chinese way of life is so far removed from what I know that I find it totally fascinating, even though the pace is always a bit slower than most of the \"western\" titles I read. Highly recommended. The Story: In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu shu (\"women's writing\"). Some girls were paired with laotongs, \"old sames,\" in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become \"old sames\" at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart. ...more Every once in a while after finishing a book I am reluctant to pick up another one.

Picturing mys Every once in a while after finishing a book I am reluctant to pick up another one. I need to spend a few days thinking and picking apart the book processing new things learned, deciding how it fits in with my world view, admiring prose, and analyzing if I really \"believe\" the story and accept the author's conclusions. This book had all of that. New things: nu shu a secret written language of women a thousand years old. And foot binding, I was horribly fascinated and oddly touched. Picturing myself going through this process with my own 7-year-old. Not a chance!!! World View: Set in the mid-1800's in rural China I was filled with helplessness and horror as I read of among other things arranged marriages, foot binding, death, and abuse. Strangely, I never felt pity. I love a writer that can draw you in to the story so completely that what happens is how life plays out. They write without a plea for sympathy because the point of the novel is not the plot devices or what life was like but the underlying story itself. Prose: Rice-and-Salt Days: what a perfect description of that time in our lives when so many of us are \"just\" mothers or \"just\" women. When our days are consumed with the details of running a home. Clean, cook, repeat... And the nu shu itself...a language based on phoenetics to be always read in texture, context and shades of meaning. How relevant this simple lesson in the beginning of the book was to the story that played out. Analyzing: I did believe this story and all of it's layers. I have experienced a little the satisfying, healing and happiness to be found in our relationships with other women. I do believe that we have influence on the circumstances around us, even when we start out holding none of the power. And I believe in love and it's power to shape and direct our lives. ...more \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0648\u064a \u064a\u0641\u062a\u062d

See reveals to the reader the life of the Chinese woman whose obligations were to not only obtain the smallest feet possible, but to serve her family, parents-in-law, and siblings. Throughout the piece, See does an excellent job of portraying Lily and Snow Flower\u2019s daily rituals as they say goodbye to their adolent days in preparation for becoming mature, marriageable Chinese women. The book begins on the six month of the third year of Emperor Daoguang\u2019s reign in Lily\u2019s hometown village, Yongming County: also known as the county of Everlasting Brightness. Near the beginning of the novel, Lily, due to her beautiful feet, is granted a laotong, Snow Flower. Lily and Snow Flower undergo the process of foot-binding together as they learn \u201cnot just the physical trials,\u201d but the \u201cmore torturous pain of the heart, mind, and soul,\u201d (See 46) while they realize what it takes to become a marriageable woman. Throughout the novel, the girls endure many trials, such as poverty, intense training, and even starvation as they prepare for marriage. Because of her family\u2019s low social status, Snow Flower does not end up with the family she had dreamed of. Lily is welcomed into a family of wealth and social status; however, she soon realizes that her life, despite its luxuries, is anything but paradise. See portrays the tragic lifestyle of the typical Chinese woman. She includes vivid and often gruesome descriptions of the process of foot-binding, educating the reader on the high expectations Chinese women were required to uphold during the early 1800s. Snow Flower and Lily\u2019s relationship represents a safe haven. Throughout the novel, Lily and Snow Flower stick together through their trials, reminding themselves that although their lives are not anything near perfect, they have each other, and sometimes that is all humans need. Even in the beginning of the novel Lily explains, \u201cFor my entire life I longed for love\u201d (6). Lily, like most of mankind, wants nothing more than to be completely connected with another individual; she yearns for that inseparable bond that humans chase after their entire lives. The girls eventually have a fight; yet, See demonstrates that true love lasts forever. The girls never officially make up, but See still utilizes the last scene with Snow Flower and Lily together to illustrate the strength of such a deep connection. Though Lily makes a irrational judgment about Snow Flower, and although Snow Flower deceives Lily, their love is still stronger. Lily spends the entire novel reflecting back on her mistakes while knowing that although they had a breakthrough, Snow Flower forgives her. In crafting Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Lisa see portrays the human need of love and commitment. Lily and Snow Flower undergo many trials throughout the book, but in the end, their hearts still remain connected, whether or not their minds and bodies agree. Throughout Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Lisa See gives the reader an accurate representation of the duties of a Chinese woman. See does an excellent job with vivid word choice and imagery. The reader cringes during the explanation of foot-binding and empathizes with the women who were brutally beaten by their husbands for being unable to uphold civic duties as a wife. By using such vivid imagery, See evokes emotion and connections with the reader, making the book an easy, quick read. By utilizing Snow Flower and Lily\u2019s friendship, Lisa See illustrates to the audience the significance of love, friendship, and commitment, as sometimes those are the only things available in the midst of trials and tribulations. ...more I just finished this book today.

I need to spend a day or two reflecting on the story to complete this review! OK-Here is my review: This is a fascinating, well researched book about the lives of two girls who grew up in China in the 19th century during a time when women were not respected or cherished, and painful footbinding was part of their growing up years. The book is well researched and gives compelling insight into Chinese culture, including superstitions, values and beliefs during that time. The book gave a remarkable account of the childhoods and adulthoods of the two main characters, Lily and Snow Flower. You really need to read the book to capture the depth and complexities of their intimate and binding relationship. There were several surprises in this book that I wasn't prepared for at all and I won't go into detail about them. Maybe I didn't need to put a spoiler alert on for this review? I must say that one of the unexpected turns that took place was when Lily jumped to the wrong conclusion about a message she had from Snow Flower. OK, spoiler coming. Stop here if you don't want to know what happened. Lily mistook what Snow Flower said to her in a message. As a result, she was devestated, felt betrayed, and for her their friendship ended at that moment. Rather than engage in a dialog between her laotong, she emotionally shut herself off from the relationship. Snow Flower, who was unsure why Lily had cut her off, made attempts to communicate with her but, Lily felt too betrayed to respond or acknowlege these attempts. However, when Lily learned that Snow Flower was terminally ill, she went to be at her bedside and nurse her, never leaving her side. It was only after Snow Flower died that evidence turned up that Lily completely misinterpreted the devestating message from Snow Flower. So, Lily had to learn to deal with the guilt of the pain she caused Snow Flower with her painful rejection as well as the guilt she felt from a particular day when she verbally lashed out her angry feelings to Snow Flower saying words that she could never take back. The rest of the book, of course, is the story of how Lily goes on to honor her \"old same\" Snow Flower and make up her mistakes by embracing the future of grandchild so she would have a better future. This is my favorite book of all time! Highly recommended! ...more My review from Amazon (back in the days before I discovered goodreads!) -- I read this several years ago, but felt compelled to start a literary argument with my sister when I heard she actually liked this book. ;) \"The Secret Life of Bees\" meets \"Women of the Silk\" I'm getting a little tired of the \"female friendship\" genre that seems to pervade contemporary literature these days.

While there are some better-written examples of this category, many of them seem to be written with the agenda of extolling the virtues and possibilities of close female friendship, perhaps as an alternative to traditional romance novels. Often, I feel that these authors are so anxious to idealize the close bond between two women that they spend less time actually allowing this bond to develop in a convincing way. Their characters remain underdeveloped as well, leaving the reader with an overdone, unconvincing, and ultimately shallow story line. This book is no exception. The writing is not bad, and the historical/cultural context lends some interest to what would otherwise be a truly boring novel. However, the characters were hollow and their friendship, and subsequent estrangement, left me cold. I was so unenamored that I found myself wondering at the authenticity of the historical setting -- how accepted were these ritualized female friendships, and did they really take precedence over the marital bond at times (e.g., a wife sharing a bed with her visiting sworn sister as opposed to her husband)? I don't claim to be an expert on this period of Chinese history, but it seemed inconsistent with the little I know of the inferior status of women at this time and place. Given the author's general agenda, I couldn't help but wonder how many of the contextual details she colored in order to serve her purpose. Perhaps this may be excused by poetic license, but if it had been a better book, I would probably not be engaging in this cynical line of thought. The really good historical novels I've read were so convincing that it did not occur to me to question their authenticity. In the title of my review I mentioned two similar novels which, if crossed, would result in this story. Both of those novels fall into the category of overdone, agenda-driven female fiction. Perhaps this comes from an effort to appeal to the middle-aged female audience, who probably represents a large percentage of the contemporary fiction market. ...more On my 13th birthday, I was furiously handed a copy of Amy Vanderbilt's New Complete Book of Etiquette: The Guide to Gracious Living as my desperate cries for Madonna\u2019s Erotica album were sternly dismissed. Phrases of \"Learn to behave like a lady\" and \"Beauty comes from pain\" , swayed alongside numerous sermons on feminine mannerisms that became a major part of my teenage life. The former was courteously bestowed advising as to how a bra was essentially an undergarment and not a lacy billboard (He On my 13th birthday, I was furiously handed a copy of Amy Vanderbilt's New Complete Book of Etiquette: The Guide to Gracious Living as my desperate cries for Madonna\u2019s Erotica album were sternly dismissed. Phrases of \"Learn to behave like a lady\" and \"Beauty comes from pain\" , swayed alongside numerous sermons on feminine mannerisms that became a major part of my teenage life. The former was courteously bestowed advising as to how a bra was essentially an undergarment and not a lacy billboard (Hey! I say blame Madonna!), likewise when the resonance of my beer burps would put a bull horn to shame. The latter was peculiarly used by a genteel woman who tried waxing my legs for the first time and ended up being kicked out of her chair. I certainly showed her the \"beauty of my pain\". Over the years, my grandma\u2019s constant remarks(or 'blessings' as she would term it) on how it was important to be a dutiful wife to a husband and bear him a son was spitefully argued by me threatening dire consequences if she did not shut her mouth. Now, when I sometimes think of it, I regret of not giving a chance to understanding her frame of mind or the environment which she was raised in. My grandmother grew up humbly in the 1920s with disciplinary feminine etiquettes given a higher preference over academia, whereas I was nurturing on a steady diet of Beverly Hills 90210 & Co. Our worlds were separated through an entire generation and I could never comprehend her anxiety towards my adulthood. Lisa See speaks of an earlier communal generation our evolved minds scorn or laugh away without giving a chance for a valid rationalization. It was a sisterhood sworn for life where happiness and sadness were shared through a secret language in an era, where \u2018fate was predestined\u2019 and \u2018golden lilies\u2019 were not flowers but an agonizing ordeal bound by austere customs. Lily who was born in the third year of the Emperor Daoguang\u2019s sovereignty (1823) was the second daughter of a modest farmer.To brighten her prospects of finding a prosperous groom Lily\u2019s first break from tradition came through a her laotong or same old - Snow Flower from Tongkou county. Snow Flower would now be Lily\u2019s soul sister forming an undying bond of sisterhood sharing their life, desolations, joy and pledging loyalty to each other through nu-shu , a clandestine language exclusively learned to share their innermost grievances. From the tender age of seven, both these girls evenly obeyed customary rituals, right from bearing the treacherous process of foot-binding to a dedicated living after their marriages and heartbreaking miscarriages. As observed in the book, the story seems to be an outright semi-autobiographical sketch of Lily Lu. Contrary, this overwhelming portrayal is solely about Snow Flower and her altruistic allegiance to Lily as her laotong . The relation between these two women speaks volumes of a philosophical friendship formed through secret scriptures carved on a fan acting as link in a world where women were not allowed to love but comply with the concept of obligatory love that came with their designated roles of a daughter, wife, mother and finally as the matriarchal head of the family. [image error] Lisa See manages to bring forth various staunch customs that were a stubborn part of a culture centuries ago. The inhumane(as I assert my belief) tradition of foot-binding that required fastening the feet of a young girl into a form of a lotus bud restricting the length to seven centimeters for the reason that the \u201cgolden lilies\u201d (feet) were a mark of magnificence and its aptness was a standing for forthcoming prosperities. Debatably, inflexible rituals were a part of any culturally strong society prevailing over hundreds of years proclaiming the belief that women were meant to suffer as they were insignificant individuals to their natal families and at most times seen as a mere vessel to carry a male progeny. Several derogating customs imposed on women throughout centuries like child marriages, foot-binding, insulting display of conforming virginities, dowry regulations and many more have fortunately been banished from the current evolved civilization. The one I am extremely curious about is the Burmese Long Neck Women of the Kayan tribe abiding the tradition of compactly casing a brass coil around their necks to attain 'Giraffe necks' associated with beauty. Although most of them have been banished from the law of the land yet, a few have escaped the judicial eye occurring in many ethnic tribal regions of the global panorama. Female genital mutilation to speak of still thrives in the deep pockets of the African sub-continent whereas female infanticide resulting through pressure of birthing a male heir and concealed dowry deaths still see the daylight in rural Indian landscapes. Let alone vast cases of domestic abuse utilized to confirm the marital dominance. O boy! Before my inner feminist crosses the edge of civility, let me move further with this review. The significant practice of nu shu as a communicative pathway disappeared with future generations and its traces can now only be found in the memories of elderly ladies. Reading this book made stop to reflect on the rearing of my grandmother wrapped up in customary obligations of compact arranged marriages, the responsibility of bearing a son and the preferences given to her several brothers over the girls. I can\u2019t even imagine going beyond her mother\u2019s generation and the suffrage women endured in the name of tradition. Lisa See always manages to hit close to home with all her narrations, fortunately not intimately. The book is an absolute page-turner because it not only restrict you from putting it down but empathize a noble sisterhood defining the loyalty of a selfless love in an era where rigidity of foot-binding swallowed up one\u2019s heart. ...more When a girl, obey your father; when a wife, obey your husband; when a widow, obey your son .

The two girls write to each other in nu shu , the secret language of Chinese women, and their bond blossoms - together, they endure the painful practice of foot binding, the trials and tribulations of arranged marriages, and the joys and sorrows of motherhood. At the age of 80, Lily recounts their shared lives, including the tragic incident that may have tore them apart. Many people praise two elements within Snow Flower and the Secret Fan : foot binding and nu shu . Foot binding disturbs me no matter how many times I read about it. Though it does reveal a lot about women within Chinese society and what they suffered through for status, I still had to take deep breaths and numb my mind with music when I read the scene where Lily and her sisters had their feet bound. Nu shu also adds a cultural component to the context of the story, and from the author's note in the back of the book I could tell Lisa See researched it extensively. Because the narrative of the book entails Lily looking back on her entire life, the writing comes across as detached and clinical at times. While Lisa See still incorporates wonderful imagery whenever Lily manages to escape the women's chamber, her passive perspective provides us with an authentic view of women within China's social hierarchy. Yes, it really does suck to read about the abuses women suffered at the hands of those they held closest to them. But through Lily's experience we gain a greater fortitude against such behavior - and we learn that friendship can help us fight it. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan draws almost all of its strength from Lily and Snow Flower's friendship. If I were to discuss it in a book club setting, foot binding, nu shu , and the role of women in Chinese society would all serve as appetizers. The laotong relationship between Snow Flower and Lily would act as my meal. It encompasses endless emotions and ideas: love, shared sadness, bittersweet humor, longing, and my favorite, redemption. Lily's character in relation to Snow Flower and the actions they take because of each other amaze me. Within a minute I could relate their bond to affirmative action, the psychological rules of attraction, my own personal friendships, and much more. Highly recommended for those in search of a quiet, poignant story. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is by no means a thriller, but it is profoundly touching, to say the very least. *review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice . ...more Over the centuries every culture has its own version of \"perfection\" and refinement that sets people (women, mostly) apart from their counter parts.

The brutality of it was expected in the same way corsets were used in Victorian England to make the waists look tinier. Over the time, the requirements for refinements have changed but haven't completely disappeared. Women to this day are subjected to body type slurs when the new norms of perfection aren't met by them. Lily is destined for something out of the ordinary and that happens to be being \"old same\" with a girl from upper class by the name Snow flower. The similar tempered girls become fast friends the moment they meet and promise to share everything for the rest of their lives. This story is gentle reveal of relationship between two women who met when they were just girls and made a contract to be soul-friends for the rest of their lives. They use \"nu shu\" to communicate, a language that's exclusively used by women for communications such as these. Lisa See writes an intimate tell-all. Lily's passage to womanhood during the process of foot binding is done with dignity; Lily accepts her fate as a necessity for progression in her life irrespective of her personal feelings about the subject matter. Lily adores Snow Flower from the very beginning though the class difference between the two keep bothering her. In a society where role of a woman was reduced to the one that produced sons and take care of the household, the system of \"old-sames\" offered companionship and a sisterhood that formed an emotional support system. As a character Lily is flawed; she is selfish, judges her soul sister too harshly and can be overtly acerbic. Narration suffers when Lily's inner monologue becomes a distraction. The plot moves rather quickly in the beginning - their childhood days and enjoys a steady pace through the rest. Its a depressing story but it does warrant at least one honest read. When we were young and doing the things children did, certain body type templates crept into our brains without our knowledge. We linger a moment longer in front of the mirror and make a mental note of statistics made by different body parts. We smoothen our skirts, readjust our dupattas and straighten our pants with our eyes constantly judging. ...more Does Oprah still have a book club? Is it secretly running underground?

This is odd because, regardless of what genres I prefer to read, I'm usually up to date on what's the newest hottest thing in the literary world. That said, I tend to avoid this sort of literature like the plague, so it's no surprise that I likely walked past it countless times without taking a second glance. I mean, just look at the cover. It's bland as a bowl of plain oatmeal. Granted there are flowers on it, but I don't even like flowers all that much, or Chinese fans. Based on the title I can tell it's the sort of historical fiction that is chalk-full of horrors to woman-kind. The sort of writing rife with Emotional Porn. You know, the kind that will force you to collapse on the ground, snotting and sobbing and crying out for your momma. *rolls eyes* The thing is, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is the sort of thing I should want to read. I mean, I am a woman. I am over thirty. Statistically speaking it should be my bread and butter. But it's not. It's totally not. I've always known I was different, and not in a quirky, adorable way. Different because I snarl in the face of convention without even meaning to. I don't fit the mold. It's like I belong on the Island of Misfit Toys Women. Whatever. I'll read Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. I'll do it because I'm sick of being the only person in the room that doesn't know all about whatever crappy new book all the Dignified Women are reading, especially when I'm the most well-read of the bunch. But if it contains something along the lines of 'You is kind, you is smart, you is important' all bets are off. P.S. I'm willing to bet Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is nowhere near inspiring as Eon: Dragoneye Reborn. ...more Being thousands of miles away from my closest female friends, I sometimes forget just how much I love them, and what it's like to share an intensely close friendship with another woman. \"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\" resurfaced those feelings for me, and reminded me of the complexity of human relationships.

At the beginning of the novel, I found myself immediately immersed in Lily's world. I didn't want to put the book down. I thought the author did a wonderful job weaving in descriptions of the setting/characters with the plot, without breaking the flow of reading just to create a picture of 19th century China. (Perhaps I had an advantage over other readers, having been to Hunan before, but I'm not sure.) Around the middle of the book, I found myself wishing that the author hadn't accelerated the plot so much and had instead taken some extra pages to elaborate on the events that occurred. I suppose I enjoyed the book so much, that I wanted to be able to delve into the characters' lives just that much more. Before I knew it, I had reached the last 50 pages of the book. Given the brevity of the novel, I have to say that I was surprised at how believable the intensely emotional closing was. I loved \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" for its aesthetic beauty, but the \"laotong\" relationship between Lily and Snow Flower captured the beauty and pain of female friendships in a very powerful way. ...more \"A woman will never become valuable if she doesn't leave her village,\" Mama cried out. \"Goodbye, Mama,\" I chanted back to her. \"Thank you for raising a worthless daughter.\" \"Goodbye daughter,\" Baba said softly.<--- Trust me, I totally LOLed :P Rating: 3.5 SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN started pretty strong for me.

And I, for one, wasn't sure if I was ready to read a book that was definitely going to make me hate the woman. But temped I was, as well as curious so I went for it. Good thing I did. I learned a thing or two about the culture, although you do get the feeling - definitely during the more intimate moments - that you're intruding. As Lily takes us back to her younger years, we see an obedient and keen to please daughter who wants more than anything for her mother to love her. But it seems that her mother is just as determined to not do so. Don't feel too sorry for her, though. Let's just say that the girl knows how to hold a grudge. Furthermore, she will go through the excruciating process of footbinding where her feet will be shaped a certain way that is deemed beautiful. This is important since it is the gateway into marrying into a good home. On the flip-side it includes broken bones and results in difficulty in walking for the rest of your life. Some do not even live through it. What is to really change the course of her life is the moment she is promised to Snow Flower. Another child her age. They are to be 'sames' an emotional bond that lasts forever. This bond, in particular, will run deeper than any other. This match also introduces the language 'nu shu'. A secret language known only among women - which I found absolutely fascinating. The two for many years will use it to write to one another and leave messages on a particular fan that they have held dear since childhood. I have to say, the middle of the book I struggled with. I even contemplated leaving the book for a while and coming back to it another time. Yet I resisted and I'm glad. You know, many that these two girls hold dear pass away. Yet I never really mourned or felt their loss, and I'm not sure what to make of that. Our protagonist, Lily, is another to brood over. She will go through so much. But on the flip-side, it's what she goes through that will shape her into the wise women that is introduced to us in the first few pages. I guess the fact that she accepts her faults is a start, but it doesn't help lessen my frustration towards her throughout the book. She does some shitty things. Thing is? As her status grows, so does her ignorance, insensitivity and pride. And towards the end - no mater how much she regretted - I just didn't care for her by then. I didn't like her, but I did come to the conclusion that a part of me could respect her for all that she had endured and done in order to repent. They lived in a time where everything is so male-dominated. Where their culture expects women to be quiet, polite and obedient to their men. Where bearing a son is of utmost importance and a daughter a curse. I mean, everything in centred around making the husband feel like a king, if not the husband then the father, if not the father then the son. The thing is that these girls are brought up with these values, so most don't even question them which is probably the sad part. But this is something that is a part of many cultures out there, that is still out there. It's not alien to me, in fact, it's something that my mother grew up with and something that I'm sure her mother grew up with. This circle, to be honest, has only broken with me. So yes, I'm aware of the implications of this way of thinking, and the way it affects you growing up with it. But interestingly enough - if you pay attention, some women do fight back in their own way in the novel. With their wit :) I wasn't as emotionally invested as I would have liked to have been, and the book did go on the verge of boring halfway through, but overall I quite enjoyed it. What made it worthwhile overall was not only learning about their customs but the bitter-sweet friendship that Lilly and Snow Flower shared. ...more A gem of a book, an incredible tale of friendship and what it means to be a woman.

This book took me completely out of my own world and into Lily's, which is so different from anything I have known. I enjoyed reading about the many rituals and traditions practiced in China at that time - some of them beautiful and some barbaric. The author's attention to research and detail is evident in every page, I learned so much about China reading this work of fiction! I felt a strong connection to the characters in the book and thought of my own friendships; \"old sames\", and \"sworn sisterhoods.\" I have just finished reading it but know I will be reflecting on it for awhile. This is a story that stays with you.

You get more absorbed, your mind more focused, like a movie-watching experience (especially one in the cinema): a highly cohesive, tight story-telling experience with no channel-surfing. Like when you're a kid, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of your teacher as they read aloud from a picture book, pointing out the details in the illustration while you gaze, mouth open, riveted. Or like watching a train crash. It's that same \"can't look away\" feeling. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is definitely not a train wreck, in terms of writing or accomplishment, but it did have an element of threat and suspense that is symbolic of one. Taking place in rural 19th century China (by our calendar, that is), Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is about Lily, now a remarkably old lady in her eighties, writing her private memoir from her days as a girl growing up poor and her friendship with Snow Flower. Taught the secret women's written language of nu shu by her aunt, when she is six the matchmaker arranges for her to have a laotong - like an official best friend - and agrees that with her feet, her mother should not bind them until she is seven, but that she will have the smallest \"golden lilies\" and will be able to get a rich and important husband in the nearby village of Tongkou - a very high aspiration indeed. It is her friendship with Snow Flower, the daughter of a wealthy and important family in Tongkou, that is the driving force of this story, the focal point, the ugly truth that Lily now wants to tell us. We are silent witnesses to an old lady unburdening herself. Rich in cultural detail, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is powerful not just in its story - a story about women in a land where the women wholeheartedly believe they are worth nothing - but in its historical accounting. I remember when I was small, going with my mother to the museum with its Chinese exhibit, and seeing these tiny shoes, brightly embroidered little slippers that looked like they might just fit a baby. No, my mother told me, these shoes were worn by women. She told me about their tiny feet, and how they bound them. It was something my child's mind couldn't really grasp but was still fascinated by. Years later, while in a doctor's waiting room, I read an article on the last living women - rural women, from a small village somewhere in China - who had had their feet bound (in, I want to say Cosmo ). The account of the procedure was somewhat different from what is described in Snow Flower and the Secret Fan - more horrific, if that's possible. Like with female genital mutilation (FGM, or female circumcision), it's yet another torture inflicted on women in the name of either fashion or purity or whatever nonsense the men can concoct. Because, of course, on these tiny feet, the women could barely walk (and with FGM, they can't take any pleasure in sex). What an effective way to control them! And even better, like with FGM, they do it to themselves - willingly!! What idiots we women can be! (Let's not forget the corset, or even the things we do to ourselves today.) I loved reading about footbinding in this book. I was riveted. It wasn't just the process, which was educational in its detail, but also the mentality behind it. Some of these girls died from this. But because girls are considered worthless (sons are the greatest treasure and the only reason to have women around), the mothers don't hesitate to do what is necessary in order to marry them off - and get them off their hands. They're just mouths to feed otherwise. Lily is a product of her time, her culture: she doesn't judge this, not even when her sister dies from blood poisoning. She is proud of her Golden Lilies (the men had sexual fetishes for them); it's because of her tiny feet that she married so high and became Lady Lu. And anyway, it's not the point of the story. The novel celebrates women, and as we bear witness to Lily, the book itself gives witness to all the Chinese women who lived this life. It's not a pretty life. But amongst it there is beauty. The secret language of the women, nu shu , is remarkable: a phonetic alphabet created by women, used only by women, that men couldn't read - and, to be honest, had no interest in reading. It may be the only language like it, but the Japanese had something similar. In Japan, there are several alphabets in use: kanji, the adopted Chinese characters; hiragana and katakana, two Japanese alphabets; and romaji, our Roman/Latin alphabet. Hiragana and Katakana are lovely, simple characters, easy to read and I wish they would dump the kanji and just use these! But I digress. Hiragana was used by women because the men considered it beneath them - Chinese kanji was the alphabet of scholars and leaders. (Katakana is a shorthand version of kanji, like writing quickly, that is now used for foreign words.) I learnt this interesting tidbit from some of my students when I lived in Japan. Because the men considered it an inferior alphabet, they couldn't read it, thus the women had their own secret language. Just not so secret! But I haven't mentioned Snow Flower yet. The characterisation in this novel is excellent, and I especially liked the development of Snow Flower. She isn't an easy character to like (neither is Lily at times - mostly because the mentality of these women is so different from the western one), but she is perfectly understandable and this makes her sympathetic. Even more so as the novel goes on and the lives of these laotong diverge so greatly - Lily goes from poor to rich while Snow Flower goes from rich to poor and abused. There is tragedy in this story, but it's balanced by the strength, resilience and fortitude displayed by these women. What's interesting, with Lily, is what she doesn't tell us. There're many details and people she skims over. She doesn't talk about her husband - he's there, he talks, but it's like a business arrangement or a room in a house: it's there, you accept it, but you don't love it or hate it. It's just part of your life. Like a mole on your face. There's the wife of Elder Brother, whom we never see even when she must be in the room, and Lily's children - the sole purpose of her existence, apparently - she doesn't reflect much upon. I guess, from the premise of her writing from an old age and writing the story she wants to tell, some characters just aren't important at all, and others just aren't that necessary. She can be almost heartless at times, and very generous and loving at others. Really, she's a more complicated character than Snow Flower is. Calling a novel \"powerful\" is a terribly boring clich\u00e9 but it is a true one. This novel is powerful. I felt like I lived it. Even if I hadn't been taking part in a readathon, I doubt I would have been able to put it down easily. ...more<---C>Snowflower</---C>", "Title": "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"},
