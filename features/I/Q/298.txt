I also adore Dumbledore's role in this book--his conversation at the end with Harry put me to tears. Rowling did an amazing job with the character of Umbridge...never have I hated a fictional character more than I hated her. I do have to admit, I'm curious to see whether she makes any more appearances or not. For me, this book was stronger for character development than plot. Yes, this is a key book for the series, but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters' internal issues and development rather than the plot. I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death. As with all of her books, I have a really difficult time putting these books down, but especially within the last 100 pages, I physically could not separate the book from my hands. Overall, another outstanding addition from J.K. Rowling. ...more Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry\u2019s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. R Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry\u2019s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM! The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he\u2019s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there\u2019s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy\u2019s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you anything about what we\u2019ve been doing, and we\u2019ve been doing A LOT. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll see you soon, we just can\u2019t tell you when\u201d? As if he hasn\u2019t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s Harry. Doesn\u2019t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what\u2019s best for him better than he does? And that\u2019s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children\u2019s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child\u2019s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren\u2019t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn\u2019t infallible. James Potter isn\u2019t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn\u2019t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that\u2019s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George\u2019s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry\u2019s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn\u2019t sunshine and roses and you don\u2019t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don\u2019t get the sense that Sirius\u2019s death was a righteous one. You don\u2019t get resolution. He didn\u2019t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I don\u2019t necessarily \"enjoy\" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.

I will start by saying that this is one of my least favorite books in the series, and that isn't because it's bad, BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY NOT. It's mainly due to the fact that I hate Umbridge more than words can translate, and having to read about her so much just infuriates me, rather than giving me warm fuzzies the entire time I'm reading.

I will start by saying that this is one of my least favorite books in the series, and that isn't because it's bad, BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY NOT. It's mainly due to the fact that I hate Umbridge more than words can translate, and having to read about her so much just infuriates me, rather than giving me warm fuzzies the entire time I'm reading. That being said, here are some of my thoughts on the book: -mention of Regulus Black near the beginning of this book. I've noticed particularly during this re-read that J.K. Rowling tends to mention characters a book or two before they will have any importance to the story. She seriously knew what she was doing while writing these books. -it's so weird to think that Sirius is related to Narcissa and Bellatrix! Sirius is such an amazing human, and he was born into a terrible family, which is pretty true of a lot of people. Just because you come from something/somewhere terrible, that doesn't mean you can't be different and be good. -Ron and Hermione becoming prefects is just so great. Surely there would be a better candidate in their year to be the male prefect, yet Dumbledore chose Ron. Why? Because Dumbledore knows that Ron always feels worthless in comparison to his five older brothers, and him becoming prefect was enough to make him feel like a winner at something. Dumbledore is cool like that. -Quite often I forget that St. Mungo's exists since it's not in the movies at all. Here, we get to see Neville's parents, as well as Gilderoy Lockhart (who is adorable now and not at all annoying), and I WISH THAT WAS IN THE MOVIES. -it sucks that Harry was banned from playing Quidditch this year, as I LOVE Quidditch. and Harry was so sad because of it, which made him cranky and quite insane. HOWEVER, I love that Ginny took over for him as Seeker. I feel like Ginny has grown up so much already, and it's particularly in this book that I grew to really like her. She's so much better in the books than in the movies. -In the epic fight near the end of the book, NEVILLE IS SO BADASS. If you ever think that Neville isn't brave until the last book, you are wrong. He was throwing himself at Death Eaters and Stunning the shit out of everybody. It was awesome. -As usual, lots of information was revealed in the last couple of chapters of the book. This particular book reveals A LOT of stuff that most people were probably wondering about whilst reading the other four books, as well as information that you probably didn't even think of. I love how many answers we get in this one. I THINK THAT'S IT FOR NOW. I have a lot of feelings, so I might add more later. ...more SO many feels!!! I really love this book.

It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix. On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either. Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned. As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more. Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books. ...more Edit #3: 27/3/2015 I am still getting positive feedback over this and every time I read what you guys and girls have told me, my heart swells.

Edit #1: 8\\3\\2014 It has been four months that I posted this review. And so far I have received great feedback. Thank you everyone for yo#ur support ^^ Remember, this is not a benign cause. 6/11/2013 I know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently, and I ought not to have done that. You see, I wasn\u2019t very free recently, and well because I didn\u2019t know what to either say or on what book should I post it. And then I read this book, and the rebelliousness in this book made me think that hey, this book is perfect for what I have in mind. Oh, and guess what! I am going to be aggressive. Let me tell you something maybe a lot of you people are not aware of. We, people who live in the Middle East, look up towards the west, where presumably, everyone is free to say and do whatever they want, bounded by no tradition or religious law whatsoever. But when this kind of law is forced upon everyone from the west itself, we lose hope. We lose hope that anything will be good again. And well for someone (me), who has suffered a lot because of that (Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted), I found a haven for myself in Goodreads, where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well, they don\u2019t care. And because they are mature enough to ignore any insults under the pretext that it is \u201cyour opinion\u201d. Do you know how much I love that? I have suffered A LOT because of that. Let me tell you something about myself. I never EVER stay quiet about something that I believe to be true \u2013 even if I was wrong to many other people \u2013 and now Mister Money-Head-Of-Amazon has to ruin that for me. All right, I realized that everything that was said about the new policy was said in the utmost civilized way. But guess what! I am a teenager. I don\u2019t give a damn about manners, and I am about to say what everyone has wanted to say for a long time. Goodreads by succumbing to the green papers have restricted my freedom of speech. In the last few years, I have been bullied, put down, humiliated, insulted, punished\u2026 just because I wanted to say what I had in mind, just because I always stand up to what I believe in. And since because ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME, I turned towards Goodreads where I was surprised that no one cared about whatever I said, and always respected me when I wanted to express myself. No review of mine has been removed, but a lot of people\u2019s reviews have been removed. Since it didn\u2019t affect me yet, I should shut up, right? No! Just the fact that it exists is bothering me. It is like having this law around forbidding people to eat chicken, and I hate chicken, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should keep quiet. Okay, that was a bad example, but the closest I had to the ridiculousness of what we are fighting for. No one should fight for his right to express himself freely. It is a right. We are born with that right. And no number of reviews removed is going to change that. It is not going to frighten us. It is not going to make us back out. You can remove all the reviews you want, Goodreads, but this is something I believe in. So I am fighting, even if you have to ban me. Well, according to your own policy, you can't do that. Well, you can't even remove the reviews that have been put before the declaration of that censorship but you do it anyway. So you are bunch of hypocrites. You, Goodreads managers, anyone with the IQ of a peacock can realize that what you have done is so wrong on so many levels. If I were the Goodreads manager, I would say this to the Amazon Manager when he came offering the new law \u201cYou can take your money and your pathetic ass out of my office! You cannot threaten us with money or hold it over our heads! This company has so far made you millions of money just by existing and promoting your books! More than half of our members buy regularly from your website! In fact, according to this logic, you owe us!\u201d GR Manager slaps Amazon Manager. Jackie Shan bursts into the scene wearing nothing but a newspaper around his waist. Kung fu! Jackie kicks Amazon Manager\u2019s head off, and his body goes around looking for its head. Meanwhile, GR Manager holds both the head and the body and throws them from the window of the headquarters. BOOM! The end. This policy is so wrong. If people like us cannot express themselves online, then where will they? I might not insult your precious little authors, Amazon Manager (in my opinion they shouldn\u2019t be called authors if they can\u2019t take god damn criticism. Not everyone should approve with them), but I have every god damn right to express myself freely without having to worry whether my review would be removed or not. The management even has no right to go around reading whatever we say online because well, I thought they had better things to do. It turns out I was wrong, don\u2019t you think? Anyway, what we say online is OUR concern, not yours. You shouldn\u2019t threaten us. You shouldn\u2019t condemn us. Maybe to you, you are only deleting a review, but to us you are restricting our freedom. And no one really appreciates freedom but the ones who have been deprived from it. I wonder how the Goodreads Management even agreed to this. I had a lot more to say about this on my mind, but I think I have made my point quite clearly. Us, readers, and the ones who write a bit like I do, find words our strongest weapon. Back to my review about this book. THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ! I have cried 50 pages straight.

This is the kind of perfect books that makes you feel as though all happiness, innocence and hope had been sucked out of the world, and until everything in the book is fixed, nothing in the world will ever be right again. I have really a lot of controversial feelings about this book, but it all goes down to one point. It is good. It is worthy of five stars.

It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.

It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale. My issues with it: - deals with complex social/political problems in a simplified, extreme, and dichotomous manner - characterisations are too easy/lazy- all good or all bad (with the exception of Snape who's good/evil intentions are yet unknown), all courageous or cowardly, the righteous or the corrupt. - Malfoy junior is the most incompetent nemesis in the history of evil. And whilst this was acceptable in the earlier books where there was an element of the comical in his attempts to be evil, by book 5, where the themes have become signifantly darker, he and his side-kicks' unchanging and inane attempts to foil Harry's ultimate fate have just become annoying. The only saving grace is that Harry has more than enough true and worthwhile enemies and obstacles for the reader to really get bogged down by Malfoy's silliness. - the laudable themes of power/corruption/propaganda/censorship are played out with such naive characterisations, extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas. - the plot seems confused, as if JK Rowling has all these ideas, but is unsure of where she ultimately wants to go, thereby leaving in all these subplots that neither has entertainment, wisdom nor story-advancing value. EG what's with Grawp and the freaking giants?? Overall- read it only as a part of the greater goal of coming closer to the ending of the series. ...more I know I overwhelmed Goodreads with my abundant reviews this week but I promise this is the last I\u2019ll post until I finish Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince which will probably take a week.

I know that I should be using my days off to rest but I just couldn\u2019t keep my hands off Harry Potter. Even though this is even longer than the fourth book, I finished it triumphantly in three days to be exact. As usual, the ff. are my usual gibberish while and after reading HP books: 1.

I swear Prof. Umbridge is the reincarnation of a professor I once had in college. Getting to know her is like reliving those dreadful days. Her carefully structured theory based method= blech! 5. Brilliant, Prof. Mc Gonagall. You show that Umbridge woman off! 6. When has Ginny started to become so clever and funny? 7. Romance is quite in the air but not for long really. Lol. 8. Hermione fell nothing short of brilliant and as usual, she is right. She\u2019s always right. When will you learn that, Harry? 9. Prof. Lockhart turned up! Poor thing. 10. Woohoo! Show that old bat, Fred and George! What a legendary departure. 11. I have never taken a liking to Peeves until now. 12. Kreacher, you treacherous elf! 13.

It\u2019s about time the Dursleys learned their lesson. * I didn\u2019t bother taking notes of the things the movie missed or gotten wrong because there are just too many but I have to say the Umbridge actress played the character spot on and so did Luna Lovegood, Bellatrix and of course Voldz. One thing I commend the movies for from the first one up to the fifth would be the choice of actors and actresses who gave justice to their characters.^^ Goodbye, real world!

There's blackout here ;_; 4.9 Stars 'Yeah' said Harry, 'but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.' I supposed to post the review yesterday but there was a blackout while I was reviewing and you can imagine how pissed I was when suddenly my computer was off and the review was already quite long. I was like this : well, I wasn't screaming because it was midnight but I was really really angry. well let's talk about this book :D *breaths in Breaths out* there were lots of tears, laugh, sadness, happiness and anger while I was reading it and I'm here still can't accept the death of the guy I cared care. I mean, why do I always lose charcters that I love or care?!?! why Sirius?! not Kreacher or anyone, anyone means Cho Chang actually... okay let's begin with Cho Chang. I Ship Harry With Ginny Not Cho Chang I totally HATE this girl. She is a cry baby and she is also weird. one minute she is happy and then suddenly she bursts into tears and she always exaggerate problems. little problem can be big problem with her and I still don't know why Harry had feelings to her. yes, had. because he doesn't like Cho Chang anymore. YAY! finally he opened his eyes! and these scenes made me hate her so much : \u279c He turned to saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face. \u279c 'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'd u - u - understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d - didn't you?' \u279c 'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain. \u279c 'I'm really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.' \u279c 'That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Chp fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list -' 'I think it was brilliant idea,' said harry coldly, Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter. 'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea -' 'Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly. 'I wasn't going to! she shouted. 'Yeah ... well ... good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cop with at the moment.' 'Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off. \u279c 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Cho's face when Ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose?' 'I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly, 'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though ...' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?' and she was totally insane, why did she have to ask about Cedric to Harry while they were dating. of course Harry didn't want to talk abou Cedric! and Didn't she have feelings?! I'm sure Harry didn't want to remember that horrible memory. I ship Harry with Ginny because : \u2764 Ginny is funny \u2764 Ginny is not a crybaby \u2764 Ginny is brave \u2764 Ginny is more beautiful than Cho \u2764 She is basically more perfect than Cho I Don't Like Harry's Temper I know, Harry was having a hard time but that didn't mean he had the rights to be harsh to his best friends. they will always on his side and there was a scene where he snapped at Hermione. 'Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?' Harry said loudly. 'No,' said Hermione calmly. 'I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side.' There was a short pause. 'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice. 'That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. 'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?' and they continued talking. oh! I also didn't like Harry when he shouted at professor Dumbledore because he just saved his life and he's clearly older than Harry, So Harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed Dumbledore's possessions. he was totally rude I know, I know he was sad because Sirius just died and I was sad too! I cried a lot! but I didn't angry with Dumbledore. I was angry with Kreacher, Bellatrix and Voldemort. I still am, actually. how could I forgive them?! they killed Sirius! I Love Sirius Especially Young Sirius With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed. OH.MY.GOD. HE IS SO HANDSOME. BUT WHY!?! WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?!?! I LIKE SIRIUS SO MUCH!! AND NOW, I WILL NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE! LIFE IS SO UNFAIR. thank you for reading and liking this review, guys! hope you guys have a great day! \u2764\u2764 P.S. I like Luna so much! she is funny xD ...more I finished this book and now I\u2019m sad AF. I seriously cried through so much of the last few hours of the audiobook. One of my favorite characters is gone, and I had to listen to Umbridge for hours and hours. Yeah. Sad AF. AHHHH I AM FINALLY FINISHD. *collapses in a puddle* Peoples, I usually read a book in a day, two days if it's big, three if it's super huge. THIS BOOK TOOK ME FOREVER. I know there a lot of super-keen Potter fans out there, so, um, you may not want to read this review. But! But! WAIT! The biggest thing you need to know is: I seriously love this series. I do. It's so detailed and thorough and interesting and I totally see why it's captured the world in it's wizarding claws. BUT. I didn't grow up AHHHH I AM FINALLY FINISHD. *collapses in a puddle* Peoples, I usually read a book in a day, two days if it's big, three if it's super huge. THIS BOOK TOOK ME FOREVER. I know there a lot of super-keen Potter fans out there, so, um, you may not want to read this review. But! But! WAIT! The biggest thing you need to know is: I seriously love this series. I do. It's so detailed and thorough and interesting and I totally see why it's captured the world in it's wizarding claws. BUT. I didn't grow up reading it. And now? Reading it? I love a lot of things, but there are so many things that bother me, particularly about The Order of the Phoenix. THINGS THAT BOTHERED ME: + The freaking gargantuan size. This is the most important thing to note. IT IS HUGE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS BIG. The first 100-pages are numbingly boring...they cleaned house? SO WHAT. + Ron/Hermione's bickering drove me nuts. This trio of \"friends\" act so often NOT like friends, it just really grates on me. I know friends have their ups and downs, but Ron is downright rude. Harry is usually oblivious, but he doesn't help things much either. Of COURSE I'm Team Hermione here, and I know she gets together with Ron...but I ain't shipping it. + The last 50-pages were so intense and interesting...WHY WERE THEY SO SHORT?? It's like the book FINALLY warmed up and got going and got exciting and -- BOOM! -- it's done now. Plus so many interest reveals just come as a Dumbledore info-dump. Um. Seriously? + The characters, in general, drove me nuts. I love Dumbledore, don't get me wrong, but he's awfully passive. There's this whole attitude around like \"Awww, well nothing TOO BAD is going badly, so let's just wait until it gets absolutely horrific before we do anything, shall we?\" AND ARGHHH YOU STUIPD STUPID WIZARDS. + And Harry's logic...I mean, lack thereof...was frustrating. Like \"Omg, a teacher is physically abusing me...I won't tell! I'm a strong brave little melon!\" NO YOU'RE A FREAKING IDIOT. Harry's whole mantra of just suffering in silence made me so so angry. + Snape. Because it's a grand idea to have a teacher who abuses and bullies students because he had a crappy childhood. Solid work hiring him, Dumbledore. I HATE SNAPE, BTW. + In general, the book's huge GARGANTUAN themes of \"injustice\". This one is very very much me, but social injustice and discrimination against children and adults exercising their age as a way to control/lord over younger humans -- I HATE IT WITH THE FIRE AND PASSION OF A THOUSAND SUNS. Sure, yes, it has it's place in books. It's realistic. But every time I pick up a Potter book, I just get smothered with how unjust everything is and it makes me SO ANGRY. And while there are 2 dozen things I love about these books, THAT is what makes me wait, like 9 million years between picking up volumes. There should be more balance. There should be more fighting back instead of passiveness. + And please, someone remind me why Harry still needs to live with the Dursley's? Because I think we've established he doesn't. Another = injustice for no reason. OKAAAAY BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY THINK I HATE HARRY POTTER NOW AND IT'S NOT TRUE. I also have a list of things I freaking loved . And at the end of the day, I do like this series. I don't \"adore\" it like a true Potterhead, I 'spose. But I do enjoy it. THINGS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE: + The detail. okay, I do complain that the books are too big (they are) but I have to admit this makes the worlds SO INCREDIBLE DEEP. Like all the food details, the off-handed comments, the descriptions, the subjects. IT'S INSANELY AWESOME. It's not like reading about a bunch of kids going to school...it's like genuinely being there . + The fact that they actually had to DO SCHOOLWORK. So often I read books about characters who are not \"geniuses\" but still manage to save the world AND score uber well in school without doing a scrap of homework. NO. So I love that Harry Potter makes them save the world AND do their homework. And half the time I think their homework sounds freakishy fascinating. Yes, I'm having a Hermione moment. + HERMIONE. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER. She is like one of the biggest reasons I love this series and would even consider rereading (seriously!! I just said that!! Even though I complain!! I'd like to try audios one day...) because she's smart and into equality and rights and I just love her, yes okay?! +...oh and McGongall. I love her too. SO SO MUCH. She does not take a single piece of crap from anyone. SHE IS AMAZING. I love how she fought Umbridge, although I think she could've done more (like stabbed Umbridge in the eye or something) and I love how she's fiercely protective of her students. She's like a super scary mum. + The Weasleys. ALL OF THEM! Even Ginny is getting more a personality now! YAAAY. I particularly love Fred and George and I'm glad they're living their dream. (Oh, but obviously I hate Percy.) Ron is not my favourite person unfortunately, because I think he's very self-obsessed and I do find him irritating at times. BUUUUT MRS. WEASLEY IS SO FEIRCE AND WONDERFUL. + Also Luna...although I wish she had a bigger part. Maybe she will in future books?! I love her and her whimsical attitude. She's totally fascinating. + And Neville is amazing. I particularly love how when Harry was teaching the secret Dark Arts class how Neville was just THRIVING. He didn't feel threatened, and he had one-on-one help with a peer he likes and respect. EQUALS = HIM DOING SO WELL. YAY!! I feel so so annoyed at this book too because I feel Neville has a learning disability and everyone just ignores it. Some teachers do a bit more, but mostly he gets abused - by teachers and students alike. I knoooow stuff like that happens IRL. But we're not reading real life are we??? We're reading about a WIZARD school and I'll be damned if I don't sit here and demand things like learning disabilities should be given respect and help. I love Neville. KEEP FIGHTING NEVILLE. + And no matter how much I complain...I actually lost track of time while reading this!! That's right! I was reading and my eyes were burning at night and I was like \"OMG WHAT'S THE TIME?!\" so I totally read a lot later than I would usually. A book that absorbs me is definitely a good book. SEE?! I DO LIKE IT. Mostly. (I hated Umbridge of course, but duh. Who doesn't?) Ultimately it was too big and I got a wrist sprain just holding the jolly hardback, BUT! It's intense and magical and intriguing and I want to know what happens next. Also I want to see the movies. ...more my extended review of this is up NOW at https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... !

Me to me: 870 pages sounds about right. I don\u2019t even know if I can write a cohesive review of this. I\u2019ve been reading it for SO LONG. The notes I took at the beginning have long since disappeared and I just can\u2019t remember vast swaths of this book. This might be a review of the last 200 pages. Okay, the extreme Ravenclaw in me is coming out here - WHY DON\u2019T HARRY AND RON EVER DO THEIR HOMEWORK? I swear to God the sub-plotline in the middle of every single book is them falling behind in their classes, and it stresses me out. Get on top of your work! And then every once in awhile, the stakes will be way higher...and these boys still apply the same procrastination to it. It happened in Goblet of Fire, when Harry would put off working on the task hints - WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIVINATION DREAM CHARTS. And it happened in this book, when Harry just...didn\u2019t try at Occlumency. I know you don\u2019t like Snape, kid. Neither do I. In fact, my list of notes for my anti-Snape rant just kept growing through this book. BUT IT\u2019S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF COUNTLESS OTHERS! PEOPLE YOU LOVE! And poor Ron in this book, right? He finally gets good at Quidditch - good at something - and there\u2019s no one there to see him. His brothers leave him at school. Harry just...freaks out at him sometimes. Things are always rough for poor unappreciated Ron, but this is particularly tragic. And don\u2019t even get me STARTED on Neville in this book. The Gryffindor in him really comes out. His life is so hard, and he is still so brave and loving. Oh my God, I\u2019m legitimately getting choked up. Well, not actually. But as close as I get. And disclaimer, 25 percent of that sadness is because \u201cAudition (The Fools Who Dream)\u201d just came up on my Spotify and LA LA LAND IS AN EMOTIONAL FILM. Rating this book is going to be a struggle. I didn\u2019t enjoy the first 600 pages, like, at all. And then I goddamn loved the last 200. Oh god. Now I have to both delineate why the first 600 pages - which I can barely remember - were bad, while the last 200 were good. Alright, I\u2019ll try to do this quickly because clearly I\u2019m ramble-y tonight. The first 600 pages were a terrible combination of boring AND upsetting. I\u2019m still surprised by how Grimmauld Place managed to be such a snoozefest. A secret rebel order of wizards inhabiting a hidden house filled with dangerous relics manages to make me doze off? Unreal. Then we have to watch as a world we all hold dear is torn apart by terrible leadership - Umbridge, yes, but I also think we don\u2019t discuss Minister of Magic Fudge\u2019s incompetency enough. As if that weren\u2019t enough, all these fabulous characters we know and love are at their WORST in this book. I won\u2019t go off on Snape yet, but I\u2019ll explain for the others. Harry is a massive brat throughout. Hermione, my absolute fave, is a bad friend, pretentious and untrusting the whole time. Hagrid has his head particularly shoved up his ass. Dumbledore acts like an idiot, a self-admitted idiot. And Sirius ruins himself for me in this book. When he says, \u201cYou\u2019re less like your father than I thought [...] The risk would\u2019ve been what made it fun for James,\u201d he is shaming a fifteen year old, guilting him into acting against his own interest and safety by bringing up his DEAD FATHER. Disgusting. DON\u2019T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE JAMES FLASHBACK. Lupin and Sirius\u2019s speech to Harry on it? Seriously. Lacking. James and Lily should never have ended up together, never. I get why Sirius and James were so close. THEY BOTH SUCK. But there were bright sides. Neville and Ginny are absolutely fantastic in this book, and did their best to rescue it from itself. But Luna is eh for me. I just don\u2019t care about her. AND WE LOSE FRED AND GEORGE. I didn\u2019t realize how much I loved their hijinks until they ruckus\u2019d their way out of Hogwarts. But if the first 600 pages were one, one and a half stars, the last 200 were four and a half or five. I love the setting of the Department of Mysteries, I loved that big Death Eaters battle scene. I sort of liked Dumbledore\u2019s speech, but still was kind of like...okay buddy, you should know what the Right Thing is. Most importantly, I felt like Harry\u2019s mourning at the end was really well captured. Which is, you know, not an impression I get often from these books. (The Harry Potter series isn\u2019t renowned for, like, its capturing of the human experience.) And that last moment at the train station? Where all of Harry\u2019s loved ones are defending him? Killed. Me. Bottom line: I don\u2019t know what to rate this, so I\u2019ll give it that old placeholder, three stars. Not my favorite Harry Potter book, but featuring some of my favorite moments...alongside some of my least favorite. ...more \u201cWit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure.\u201d Reread - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix always gives me a challenge whenever I start reading.

So Harry has to use his magic to expel those nasty things. He never knows before his act will bring him to M.o.M. In the beginning, J.K. Rowling used the first few chapters to introduce us about the Order of the Phoenix. That got me chilled the first time I was reading about this order. I loved to see the good guys being together and figthing the Dark Lord. I was so excited about this book anyway. I have a feeling that Harry in this book is not like Harry, the one I know, he throws a tantrum when his friends don't believe about what happened last year. I understand about his age making him not stable, if I can call it. The only person I want to talk about is Professor Umbrige , I call her the pink toad, she's the character that unify everything around this book impeccably. Seeing everyone fighting with her and restraining her not to destroy the Hogwart's system make this book unique unlike the first four books. I couldn't stop laughing then. \u201cIs it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?\" \"Yes.\" \"You called her a liar?\" \"Yes.\" \"You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have a biscuit, Potter.\u201d I laughed out loud because of this scene. This book contains many emotions I can't describe all of it in one review. Do you believe me ? It is far better than the movie and the last M.o.M. scene is beyond exciting. The movie cut it out and I was so angry for that ! \u201cYou know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...\u201d The sad thing in this book is about Sirius. If you've read it, you'll know why. Every time I get my head around it, I want to cry and cry. It's so touching and heartwrenching to see that thing happens. Nonetheless, reading this book is like growing up. There's not only happiness in your life, you have to face so many regrets and learn how to move on like Harry and his friends.

I don't even have words for how much I LOVE this book. It's second in the series, to Deathly Hallows in my favourites list I just love it so much Everything about it makes me so happy. Why? Well first of all, there's leaps and bounds in terms of plot development. Things are starting to get dark, they're starting to get serious and it sets the tone for the next two books to come. I love Harry coming to take on his role as \"The Chosen One\" Secondly, side characters! Thanks to the DA, we get to see soo much more of the school aside from the golden trio. Neville, Luna, GINNY, Fred and George, Dean, Seamus, Tonks, Sirius, Remus, Cho and soo many other characters who I just adore SHINE and it makes me so happy. I love the side characters as much as the trio and they get so much more screen time (page time?) then in earlier books SO MANY COOL SCENES: I mean, the Weasley escape, the interview in three broomsticks, every DA meeting, Harry's first date, THE QUIDDITCH PITCH BRAWL, Umbridge being taken by Centaurs, the fight in the ministry, Dumbledore and Voldermorts epic duel ! There are so many scenes to love in this one. Literally iconic scenes like DA and the Weasley's leaving school can be exclusively found in ootp and I love them so much. I also just think OoTP is SO funny? I mean, the whole school rioting against Umbridge, the twins pranks, the DA meetings, the things said about Harry / that Harry says back. I laugh out loud when I'm reading this book, and I don't usually properly laugh when I'm reading. I literally just don't understand how anyone can not like ootp. I mean, beside the very sad events at the end, it's perfect. And EVEN that sad event (view spoiler) [RIP SIRIUS ORION BLACK YOU DESERVED BETTER (hide spoiler) ] gives us such a beautiful moment between Albus and Harry, that is sad, but also so incredibly human and heartbreaking and such an insight into the humanity and love that drives Harry's character it's amazing. anyway, tbh it's harry potter I shouldn't have to say much I loved reading this with all my heart, obviously. ...more *This was a reread for me* This has always been my least favorite book and movie in the entire series and I\u2019ve never really understood why.

Despite this being my least favorite I still, of course, loved it but now that I\u2019ve reread it I\u2019ve noticed many different things I\u2019ve missed when I read it for the first time. This book is still amazing and I obviously will give it five stars. Let me start off by saying th *This was a reread for me* This has always been my least favorite book and movie in the entire series and I\u2019ve never really understood why. I didn\u2019t know whether it was the plot, the characters OR the fact this book super long. Despite this being my least favorite I still, of course, loved it but now that I\u2019ve reread it I\u2019ve noticed many different things I\u2019ve missed when I read it for the first time. This book is still amazing and I obviously will give it five stars. Let me start off by saying this book as many can tell, is humongous and requires a lot of commitment. I know that many including myself are intimidated by this book. Can I also just say the writing also very small. Don\u2019t get me wrong I have nothing against long books. In fact, I prefer long books over books with only 100 pages but this book was just unnecessarily too long. I\u2019ve realized that there is a huge amount of pointless information. I know sometimes authors can\u2019t help it but I feel like I\u2019m reading for so long but am not getting anywhere. Now you\u2019re probably asking why I gave it 5 stars if I think some of it was unnecessary. I am a big fan of Harry Potter and I know what I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t true but if I gave HP less than 5 stars it would make me (and I\u2019m not saying this about anyone else) feel like I'm not a true fan. I know that\u2019s not true but it\u2019s what I think of myself . I don\u2019t know about anyone else but in bookstores, HP has always been in the children\u2019s section. And I know I know HP is a supposed to be children series but honestly, I do not consider this a children\u2019s series because well 1. I think anyone of any age can read it and 2. I cannot imagine 7 years or whatever reading an 800-page book. I don\u2019t maybe there are children that age that do but personally I can\u2019t imagine it. This book made me realize something I never realized before which is\u2026 Harry Potter is the most stuck up person ever and thinks he\u2019s amazing. Honestly, this book made realize why Draco is so mean to him. I\u2019m warning you right now I am going to rant so I\u2019m sorry. ***** WARNING WARNING WARNING***** *****SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD***** *****FOR THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS***** *****SKIP IF YOU WANT***** What I hate so much is how Harry gets all the credit! He\u2019s not that amazing and without his friends, he would have done nothing. Do you think in the first book he could have going to through that place where they had to play chess and figure out the potion without his friends? Ron figured the chess game and Hermione found out which potion. The only reason he could defeat Voldemort was because he couldn\u2019t be touched. Also in the second book do you think he would have any idea what was down in the chamber of secrets and what was freezing all the student without Hermione. I guess in the third book he did do a Patronus, I\u2019ll give him that. In the fourth book, he only won because someone was helping him but I\u2019ll give him credit for escaping Voldemort but that was because of his wand and that Voldemort told him to fight him. I get he is powerful but most of it was done with help. Without Ron and Hermione, he couldn\u2019t have done even half the things he did. I can\u2019t even imagine what would have happened. He needs to stop thinking he\u2019s amazing and that he is the only person to have gone through tough times because he isn\u2019t. I actually understand Draco\u2019s POV in the situation now. It pisses me off because Harry is actually so DUMB (I'll get into more detail about that in the 6th book) but manages to become famous and everyone thinks he so powerful. I'd like to see what he'd achieve without his friends. Wow\u2026I needed to get that out ***** SPOILERS FINISHED***** ***** SPOILERS FINISHED***** ***** SPOILERS FINISHED***** Overall I still think this book was great. Although it wasn\u2019t the best book to try and finish a reading challenge. I\u2019m glad I reread this book because I realized a lot and picked up things I missed before. I still loved this book and thought it was amazing. Also, I understand sometimes books need to be long and cutting out sections is not easy which is why books are sometimes so long. ...more A lot of people consider The Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest book in the entire Harry Potter series. I haven't read the last two installments yet, but from what I have read so far ... this one was my favorite .

I haven't read the last two installments yet, but from what I have read so far ... this one was my favorite . I enjoyed two other books in the series more than this one (The Sorcerer's Stone and The Goblet of Fire), but enjoyment is not necessarily the only aspect allowing a book to turn into a favorite. Let's go on the dark side here. While the previous books were still light-hearted in the overall atmosphere in spite of certain parts of the storylines, this one consisted to approximately 95% of darkness and a lack of happiness for all the characters involved. Studying at Hogwarts is not enjoyable anymore, life has become dangerous for everyone everywhere, favorite teachers have been replaced by unlikeable ones, dangers and traps are looming wherever you set your feet. Life is not easy for Harry Potter and his friends in this book, because not only do the dangers floating above their heads cloud their moods - they also slowly enter puberty with all the feelings and emotions involved with the process of growing-up. Not only because of the darkness of the various themes, but also due to the character development is it impossible to call this book a children's book anymore. Justice is what a lot of readers - including myself - probably missed in this book. Harry has won the Triwizard Tournament, but nobody truly acknowledges his victory. He still has to spend the summer with his merciless family, he still has to fight for his reputation and his dignity. After everything Harry achieved, life reveals itself to him in its cruelest colors, the Dark Lord's return only being one of the many aspects influencing his decline of happiness. This book also introduces one of the most despised characters in the Harry Potter universe, Dolores Jane Umbridge. Who could possibly like such a woman? Apart from imagining Imelda Staunton's inspiring portrayal from the movies which helped a lot with exploring Dolores' role in the book, her unforgiving decisions and her unforgettable appearances, it can be discussed whether Dolores Umbridge is truly a realistic character, but she supported J.K. Rowling's general direction into the dark themes of the series, and if there is one thing Dolores Umbridge's presence was good for, then it is this: It made Harry and his friends, but also the book's readers realize that life is never the way you imagine it to be. Life is cruel, life is hard, life is merciless. I love this book because it doesn't beautify things. Death is presented as a necessary part of everyone's life. All the characters are created as human beings who are full of faults and mistakes. The perfect images everyone had in their minds of characters like Albus Dumbledore, James Potter or even Sirius Black are shattered in the course of the book, only to allow the readers to form new opinions on those characters again. Those books are set in the fantasy genre, but it all felt so realistic that it was impossible not to share the thrill and the excitement of those pages - mainly because the characters felt so realistic. They are flawed. They are full of emotions. They come to decisions, and they regret decisions. But in their essence, they are human . Which is perhaps why so many readers love this series - because it feels like you accompany people into a completely different world who might as well be your friends who are sitting at your school desk next to you. [Major spoiler for this novel: (view spoiler) [I am not even angry with J.K. Rowling for killing off Sirius Black. Obviously, he was a character beloved by a lot of readers, and I would have loved to see Sirius being redeemed officially as not having committed the crimes he was accused of. But that's the very reason for why this is my favorite novel in the series so far: Just like in real life, it's not a given that the good people survive and the bad people die. You can't even always say who is good and who is evil, because there is a thin line because good and bad. (hide spoiler) ] ] A lot of fantasy authors tend to kill off the antagonists and create a happy ending with the good-hearted major characters, which is my main reason for my troubles with the fantasy genre. J.K. Rowling doesn't mind all this; with her novels, you never know who is going to survive and who is going to die, because it could be everyone. As long as you haven't been spoiled already, that is. Yes, maybe this book is too long indeed. I needed more days to finish it than I needed for all the other four books combined (considering only the respective reading time I spent with them). Yes, maybe it could be shortened, although I am the last one who knows how that could possibly be done. Yes, it is darker than all the other books in the series so far. And yes, I loved it for all those reasons. \u201cThings we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.\u201d ----------- Pre-Review (4th July): It has been three months since I finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , and only now do I finally begin reading this fifth book in the series.

Maybe it can be accepted as an explanation that I left the fourth book feeling like this and obviously needing to recuperate: So, let's continue my journey through the world of Hogwarts! Review to come once I'm finished. Which might take a while, because while it's evidently Harry Potter and shouldn't take much time to get through, my copy of this book has 1040 pages .

If I hadn\u2019t read Harry Potter when I did I would not be the same person today. What I am today, in a part is due to Harry. I cannot really say enough to make you understand how much Harry Potter means to me. The copy I own is not signed by J. K. Rowling but it is signed by Daniel Radcliffe!

It was held at a Barnes and Noble and of course John Williams\u2019s soundtrack for the first 2 movies was played on a loop throughout the night.

Yes, I did go to one and no, I didn\u2019t dress up. It was held at a Barnes and Noble and of course John Williams\u2019s soundtrack for the first 2 movies was played on a loop throughout the night. Amidst the crowd eagerly awaiting the stroke of 12, were tired adult chaperones and sullen workers who had had enough already . My brother brought me to the store and one of his friends was working there; of course being the only ginger on staff he had to dress up like Ron and did not appreciate it. I think he actually hated Harry Potter so that kind of made it worse. Let me preface this next paragraph with the following: I grew up in Las Vegas, so some weird stuff went down that probably wouldn\u2019t have happened anywhere else that night. Not only did the Mayor show up, but \u201cMaster Magician\u201d Lance Burton did too. They are local celebs, though why they put in an appearance is beyond me. More on this in a minute. So at about 11:30 everyone starts lining up to get our books. The store decided to release them before midnight and that made it all the more like catnip. I remember seeing some four year olds plopped down in an aisle with their copies, pretending to read them\u2026and I thought, who would stop me if I just took it from the kid and ran out? I didn\u2019t though, obviously, but Potter fever makes you think strange thoughts, especially while waiting in line for a highly anticipated book. Both the Mayor and the \u201cMaster Magician\u201d were signing copies of the book. I don\u2019t understand this at all, and still think that somewhere on ebay somebody must have bid on an \u201cautographed copy\u201d and gotten one signed by one of these men. While that\u2019s technically true, can you just imagine the disappointment?? When I did finally have it in my hands\u2026 oh, that beautiful gloriously blue cover. You knew from Mary GrandPr\u00e9 \u2019s artwork that something major was going to go down, and it did. I started reading it with a booklight on the drive home but was told that the light was distracting my brother\u2019s driving. Buzzkill. Didn\u2019t he know how important this was?!?!?!?! Arriving home, I went straight to bed and stayed up all night reading. At some point, I think at about 2am, my mom came into my room. She took the book from me, and flipped towards the end, read about Sirius\u2019s death, then gave it back to me without a word. (She had read the first 4 to her third grade class and still chokes up at the mention of \u201cthe boy who lived\u201d). She never actually read the fifth book or the rest, but always insisted I tell her everything that happened once I finished them. I finished it later that day. I didn't care too much that Sirius died, but I do remember being slightly miffed that Rowling never cleared up more about that Veil in the Department of Mysteries. That was such a cruel tease, Jo. ...more I liked the book, but it easily could have been 500-600 pages long. THIS IS ALMOST 900 PAGES LONG! Damn, you call this children's book? This is the only movie i have not watched yet. Therefore, i have zero idea what goes down in this. Maybe that's why i was so lost in Half-Blood Prince. This is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman. Nevertheless, it has its problems, familiar to any reader of Rowling's. She never seems to gain control of her writing, which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots. The story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices, often magic. Instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous, she uses it to cover up plot holes. Why write a consiste This is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman. Nevertheless, it has its problems, familiar to any reader of Rowling's. She never seems to gain control of her writing, which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots. The story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices, often magic. Instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous, she uses it to cover up plot holes. Why write a consistent plot when you can just put in a spell or two to fix the problems? Likewise her world is poorly defined. She did not start by constructing the 'wizarding world' and then base her stories off of it, rather she changes her setting to fit whatever she needs at the moment. This constantly shifting setting means the world doesn't make much sense if you take the time to sit and think about it. Her fractured plots are not the result of 'realism', which some authors use to create a sense of a 'real world', separate from archetypes. Rowling is just trying to fit in all the disparate ideas and characters she has in her notepad. She becomes so attached to her characters and ideas that she is unwilling to sacrifice them for a more streamlined book. She has problems connecting the many dots of her story, but uses her magical 'plot devices' to keep us from noticing that the scaffolding behind the facade is rather bare (indeed: crumbly). Her rabid plot movement points away from the cracks in her storytelling: \"move along, nothing to see here\". I find it somewhat ironic that Rowling wants to 'graduate' from Potter to writing adult mysteries. A mystery needs to have a tight plot, based not in the characters but in the events surrounding them. Though many people tried to 'figure out' the Potter books and predict them, in truth there is nothing to figure out. Rowling's foreshadowing is vague and unsupported, and there are just as many clues as red herrings. The only reason some of the elements seem predictable is because there was a crack team of several million people making every guess under the sun. Combine that with the fact that the final book introduces completely new elements to finish the plot, and we can see that Rowling is not really in charge of her own pen. She is a slave to her own sentimentality. Then again, so are millions around the world. The only thing which makes these meandering plots move along at a reasonable pace are her characters. They connect us to the magical world, so that even if it doesn't make sense, at least we can see how it might work for the people who live in it. Her characters are vivid, emotional, motivated, and archetypal without being banal. They may not be psychologically deep, but for a monomyth like this, that is hardly the point. Most people aren't that complex, either. In the series, this book gets the prize for the most psychological depth and also the most consistent mood. Before this, Rowling was still trying to get her footing, figuring out what exactly she was writing, and trying to explain the world to her readers. She finally hit her stride in 'Prisoner of Azkaban', and got much of her unsure world-building out of the way in 'Goblet of Fire'. This is before she started feeling the pressure to wrap things up in a neat package, which again begins to take its toll on her consistency. This is the first, and really the last of her books where Rowling is able to write without being overly concerned with either the beginning or ending of her series. Instead of placing a scattered plot over her characters, Rowling was instead able to let the characters travel through their own path of growth and self-exploration. The change is the most apparent in Harry himself, and though his transformation is somewhat sudden, it is still honest and believable for the character. By focusing chiefly on her strength--character building--and escaping the constraints of the monomyth, if only for a moment, Rowling is able to avoid her weakest points as a writer and turn out her strongest book.
