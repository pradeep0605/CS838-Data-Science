Sorry, my mind wasn't able to comprehend real words there for a second..... What were we talking about? Oh yeah, <+++>Faefever</+++>. First off, let me say - Best first four words of a book ever! I'd die for him. Those four words sent my mind reeling. I really thought I knew exactly what she meant and I thought for sure I knew what it meant, and is that really what it is? And then no, it really is something soooo completely different and you don't find out til much later and what the HELL???? I know, I know. Just add a few \"like\"s or \"and um\"s in there and I would have sounded like Miley Cyrus. Hey y'all, I'm Miley Cyrus! And that's preeta cool! So,<---M> it got off to a great start</---M>, but KMM's answers are just never simple, are they? Barrons just oozes sensuality. I expect if I ever came across such a man, I would act similarly to the way Mac did initially around V'lane. But I wouldn't be quite so restrained. See, Barrons represents everything we women have been trying to train out of men for the past hundred years. The restless masculinity, randomly throwing women against a wall, expecting a woman to do as you say just because you asked her to, stalking, interrogating. But I don't care because he is effing hot. I hate KMM! I hate her for making me love someone I should hate. I hate her for not giving me exactly what I want. I hate her for ending her books the way she does and for giving me goosebumps at said ending. The way I hate her for all these things that I love so much reminded of the movie \"Ten Things I Hate About You\". So I have composed a horrifically cheesetastic poem about Barrons and Mac inspired by (okay directly ripped off from) the poem in the film. I hate the way Barrons talks to Mac, and the fact that he's HOT with long hair. I hate that he let's her drive his car, and I really hate his brooding stare. I hate that he never ever laughs and the way he reads her mind. I hate how the Sinsar Duhb makes her sick, and how it makes her lose time. I hate the way he won't give her insight and I hate that's he's one big lie. I hate the way he only calls her Mac when he thinks she gonna die. I hate it when he's not around and that he doesn't answer to her call. But most of all I hate the way that I can't possibly hate him, not even a little bit, not even at all. Cheesy? Yes!

There were times when I probably would have thrown my panties at V'lane and Barrons..but then there were times I'd have smacked the shit out of them. Then there is that frigging cliffhanger of an ending!! I'm only getting one of these books a month!

This is the book that truly gets most readers on Mac\u2019s side. I\u2019ve said before that I was always there, but reading this takes me beyond that every time, makes me want to hate-morph into the living, breathing embodiment of her vengeance, pick up her spear and stab everyone that so much as looks at her wrong. She\u2019s just so\u2026 alone. *sob* It seems the only information she learns is that which she\u2019s able to barter, beg, steal, or discover for herself. No one offers anything up freely in this world of powerful enemies. Everyone plays their hands too close to their chests, especially those that expect her loyalty and compliance. I don\u2019t blame her one iota for not trusting anyone. I wouldn\u2019t have either. How can you trust people that blatantly avoid telling you anything and then have the audacity to get mad at you for making a mistake because of the ignorant state they\u2019ve willingly left you in? Yet at the same time, I can\u2019t really blame anyone else for the games they were playing. With Mac being pulled in so many directions, who\u2019s to say where her loyalties lie? Especially when she doesn\u2019t seem to know herself. Understanding the manner of their secrets as I now do, having already read the series several times, I get why they wouldn\u2019t want to reveal them to her until they could be sure of her loyalty. It's a vicious cycle. The first time I read this I found myself almost fully on V\u2019lane\u2019s side. He seemed to be the only one that was willing to help Mac. Barrons nearly gave me wrinkles around my eyes from how much he made me frown. Reading this for the umpteenth time, I feel\u2026differently. Except about Rowena. Fuck that old bitch. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to pick myself up off the floor after an ending that leaves me reeling every time, make myself a drink, take a deep breath and press on to book four. Because we all remember what happens in the beginning of book four. *waggles brows* ...more What a cruel, cruel ending...

Faefever is a very dark book and it starts out dark too. I missed Mac's happy-go-lucky attitude and flirtations with Barrons in previous installments. The only relief from the doom we get in this book comes in the form of MacHalo and Druid Voice lessons. Like the previous two books - Darkfever and Bloodfever , there is not much resolution to any big problem/mystery, but there is progress. We learn more about how Unseelie came to life, who imprisoned them and why the walls holding them together are now crumbling. We find out the nature of the Book and what makes it difficult to get a hold of it. We get to know what the Lord Master is. The Fae world is getting more and more complex. There are more players both on human and Fae side, and all characters are interesting in their own way. I am actually quite surprised that an author who previously wrote highlander bodice rippers created such an amazing mythology. But in spite of all these positives, I think Faefever is the weakest in the series structure-wise. It is hard to say what exactly the main story arc of this novel. There is a series of events, many of them dramatic, but the story is unfinished. The ending is vague, the narration stops mid-scene and it calls for a good wrap-up. I am extremely attached to the series now, to Mac and Jericho, and the entire world of Fae, sidhe-seers and Rhino-boys. I will be starting Dreamfever very soon and hope it will not leave me hanging in angst, waiting for the final chapter of this story - Shadowfever - which comes out 6 long months from now. ...more hmmmmmmmmmmmm WELL...

I look really good in dark green. Jericho Barrons is an asshat. Well, fuck. That last fact might no longer be true. I don't know how this happened, honestly. I don't think I'm a sheep. The majority of my friends have long professed their love for Barrons...and honestly, I just didn't get it. I still don't. Jericho is still not my type of guy, but upon the second time reading this book... I think he's finally growing on me . I turned around slowly, and looked up at him. He stiffened and sucked in a shallow breath. After a moment, he touched my cheek. \u201cSuch naked pain,\u201d he whispered. I turned my face into his palm and closed my eyes. His fingers threaded into my hair, cupped my head, and brushed the brand. It heated at his touch. \u201cNever show it to me again.\u201d His face was cold, hard, his voice colder. I started the Fever series with a horrible impression of Jericho that never really left. To me, he was an overbearing, patronizing, violent asshole. I have to admit that the first time around, I largely skimmed book 2 and 3, and my first, overwhelmingly terrible impression of Jericho never really changed. Upon a second reading: a more careful, critical reading, I admit I might have been wrong the first time. The contrast and complexities in his character is particularly more notable for me today, coming off the recent reading of a particularly forgettable UF/PNR book, with forgettable characters. I still don't like Jericho that much, but I love his character . I've come to see that while he is a jerk, he never goes over-the-line-violent. He stops just short of it, and he has his moments that just makes you wonder---maybe there's something there, worth investigating, under the surface . And then the next moment, it's gone. Leaving you to wonder if that spark of humanity was ever there in the first place. That's the thing that attracts me about Jericho's character...that's what FINALLY grew on me in this book. After so many books with lackluster characters, with predictable behaviors, this is one that keeps me guessing, who runs hot and cold...but just hot enough to keep me intrigued. That's why he evokes such strong emotions within me, and that's what keeps me hooked. It is easy to hate a character. Anyone can make a character merely...loathsome. It is quite another to have a character that keeps you on your toes , not knowing what he is, who he is, how he will react. It's exhausting at times, but ultimately, I am never bored, and that is what I seek within a book and its characters. Some escapism...and it doesn't get any better than the amazing world and setting in this series. Mac's character is also improving by leaps and bounds. She's still a girly-girl. She still enjoys dressing up, but reality is smacking her in the face, and she is dealing with it and adapting to the situation just beautifully. She takes action, she learns to be manipulative. She takes initiative. She is not content to remain a passive, weak damsel in distress; she is willing to seek help from the devil---or Barrons---same thing, really, if that's what it takes. Her character develops beautifully in this book. The first time around, despite my contempt for the characters, I absolutely loved the setting, the writing, the darkness of it all. This has not changed. The writing and scenery is spectacular. The portrayal of Dublin rips away the happy, safe, warm environment that I loved from reading Maeve Binchy's books---and being the creepy, strange woman I am, I think I might prefer the darkness. The writing is lovely, the insights into the nature of darkness, particularly from Mac's viewpoint, is remarkable, and is a better portrayal of Mac's inner nature and intelligence than I would have thought. She still has hope, she still has brightness within her, but Mac's understanding of evil makes me sympathize with her more than her natural effervescence and vivacity ever could . I still think I like V'lane more than Jericho, though. He began bringing me gifts. One day he brought me chocolate that wouldn\u2019t make me gain weight, no matter how much I ate. COME ON NOW. CHOCOLATE THAT WOULDN'T MAKE YOU GAIN WEIGHT? Gimme that shit. ...more I can't remember how I felt about the whole book because the end left me hopeless. The first three books were definitely leading up to something bigger. All the events could have been put into one book, so I'm eager to read the 4th with the changes set in motion by this one. I adore all the characters, Mac is so real, and Barron's is just an ass. I hate him but he's such an enigma. It's still too soon for me to write a review, but I need to talk about this book, so I'm just going to start sprouting nonsense and see where this thing will go. This will be a crap review (what else is new?) but I... gah! *flaps hands* Man , I'm loving these books, goddammit. What the hell is up with me and the Pri-ya 'tude?

I am rolling around on the floor with these books in my arms, I want to clear Amazon's entire stock of this series and shove copies at everybody who comes within a 10-mile radius, screaming \"WHY AREN'T YOU READING THIS RIGHT NOW\" in their faces. I don't even understand why these books are taking over my life right now. I'm either reading these books or thinking about these books, and I'm pretty sure I'm dreaming about them too. mostly about Barrons pressing me up against the wall and pinning my arms above my head with one hand. I love how much Mac's character is growing, I can see, feel her changing while I'm there, watching her! Right in front of me! *points maniacally* I just can't seem to find anything about her I don't like. I like her when she's Bookstore!Mac, I like her when she's ScrewYouBarrons!Mac, I like her when she's Hero!Mac.... And even Inventor!Mac. I reacted the same was as Barrons to her MacHalo. Priceless. Her constant battles with Barrons are delicious, although I felt bad when he completely trashed her attempts at being nice. I understand why she wants what she wants from Barrons, but I can also understand why he doesn't want to give it to her. That doesn't mean I can't cheer them on to go at it like bunnies in front of me. Also, this is really not the appropriate moment in the review to mention a minor but at this point, I'm barely capable of typing, because my hands keep reaching for my Kindle, but I'm growing very fond of Dani, d'aaaw, I smile every time I see her ^^ See, I can't do OMGYAY reviews.

It reminds me a bit of Iced because most of it is about Mac's interactions with the sidhe-seers: Dani, Rowena, Kat, etc. Christian is in this a lot. A main theme is also Mac's mistrust of EVERYONE around her, esp. Barrons. This is her book where she thinks he is \"the bad guy\" and that's just not as interesting to me. :P Also, V'lane is in this one a lot, and I don't like him. The ending is spectacular and shocking. I just found myself skimming a lot of the middle. There was a lot of info-dumping which works if it's a first read. You need to know all of this. But, on a third read, I just wasn't feeling it as much. Second read review : This is book 3 in the (mis)adventures of <---C>MacKayla Lane</---C>, sidhe-seer, Null, and OOP detector. MacKayla is surrounded by evil fae and people she can't trust - or doesn't know if she can. There are people who seem like they might be trustworthy (Dani, Christian, Kat), some who seem highly iffy (Inspector Jayne, Rowena, V'Lane, Barrons), and some who are downright villains (the LM - Lord Master for short, Fiona, Derek O'Bannion). And this list gets shuffled around pretty frequently, except for a couple exceptions. The thing to remember is that hardly any time has passed since book 1 and things are changing and developing like CRAZY. Mac is evolving into a pro-active quick thinker and an intelligent woman the people around her shouldn't underestimate. She's still flawed and making (beginner) mistakes which is totally understandable, in my view. New thoughts about my second read of this book: I did notice some repetitiveness in the beginning and found myself wanting to skim through the sections of Mac's longer inner dialoguing. But overall, this was just as fabulous as the first time I read it. That ending is a doozy! Cliffhanger from hell. My mortal eyes just couldn't read the words fast enough in that action-packed maelstrom of a finale. original review: Ok, I'm officially in love with this series. Still have no idea what is going on with Barrons, but that's ok. And now the whole world has gone to unseelie hell in a hand-basket. Poor Mac. Crazy cliffhanger.

Secrets upon secrets, suspicion, fear and some answers that will born more questions, an accidental tragedy and the worst fate a woman can wish, will bring Mac on the fringe of sanity and by the end destroy her.

Yes, you read that right, I almost DNFed Jericho Freaking Barrons. Silly little me. When I finished reading Bloodfever I couldn't get my hands on Faefever fast enough. I had to wait for a few days before I could read it and it was pure torture. So here I am, giddy with excitement as I start reading. The prologue was pretty good : I could have done without the recap about the previous books but I always enjoy Mac's narrative in the prologues for this series (she comes across as a much stronger character than she actually is - more on that later). The first chapter picks up right where Bloodfever ended: with Mac on a Dublin street, after an unexpected encounter with the Sinsar Dubh. I have to say that, as first scenes go, this one was pretty phenomenal. It drew me right back into the story and led me into thinking I was in for some more Fever awesomeness. I was wrong. Things went downhill from there. The problem? Mac. I found her annoying in book 1 but by the end of book 2 I thought she was getting better and finally losing the silly Ms Pinky 'I was a spoiled child' Rainbows act . 3% into Faefever she was already annoying the hell out of me: Being stupid and superficial {Where the hell is Barrons?! } , saying silly (when not downright ridiculous) things. What bothered me most {Where the hell is Barrons?! } ? Her constant blabbering to herself. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. She just wouldn't stop. {Where the hell is Barrons?! } And in the meantime, NOTHING happened. It was just Mac and her stupid inner commentary. By 13% I'd had just about enough of the general silliness. {Oh look, here's Barrons! Yay! Wait, wait, where do you think you're going?! Come back this minute! Don't you dare leave me alone with that silly girl!} At 18% Mac referred to herself as \"ruthless\" and I thought I was going to choke on my tea. Ruthless? Mac? What a joke! Come on, my neighbour's bunny is more ruthless than she is! But I digress. So here we were, Faefever and I, on the road to disaster. And it was killing me because I SO wanted to like this book! The repetitions didn't help as KMM felt the need to re-hash some things over and over again. The only highlights here: Barrons, V'Lane and Christian. Thank you gentlemen for saving the day , I probably wouldn't have made it this far were it not for you. [Incidentally, I am now planning to move to Dublin as it seems hot, dreamy, drop-dead gorgeous guys seem to be roaming the streets of the city. Sorry, I digress again] As I reached the 25% mark I was boiling up inside (\"stupid stupid stupid stupid\") and eye-rolling way too much for my own good. I just put the book down as I couldn't take it anymore and decided to momentarily give up on it. Here I have to thank my most awesomest Fever Freaks for their support because without them I would have probably DNFed the book. They kept telling me it would get better and that the rest of the series was absolutely mind-blowing so, after staying away from the book for a day, I decided to pick it up again. And guess what? HALLELUJAH, I see the light at the end of the tunnel!!! All it took was a dead body and suddenly Mac put some sense back into her little self!! A miracle I tell you!! After that it was pretty much boom bam bang , scene after scene of pure awesomess!!! I don't want anyone to hate me here so I think I'll just spoiler tag this whole paragraph. (view spoiler) [ JZB .

What with that conversation about (view spoiler) [rape during one of the Voice sessions: \"Rape isn't something you walk away from. You crawl.\" (hide spoiler) ] I could feel something really fishy was coming . Apparently some readers found the church scene particularly shocking while others gave up on the series because of it. I can't say it shocked me. It was horrible but I think KMM did a pretty fantastic job of it all . And you know what, I'm not that worried about Mac. Well she'll obviously be broken (I think) but the fact that she (view spoiler) [ate Unseelie (hide spoiler) ] before it happened will obviously change the rules of the game. We'll see. So Mac and I are on the way to reconciliation. We're not great friends yet and I still don't think she kicks that much ass but I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt. I used to like V'Lane more than Barrons but I now find myself trusting dear old Jericho more. He is still an ass but I don't think he's that evil. I might very well be wrong though. Who knows what the Constant Jackass will be up to next?

How am I, a sunshine girl from Georgia, supposed to deal with that? Barrons says that it\u2019s our fears that get us killed\u2026 but how am I supposed to not be afraid? How? I have no family, no friends and my employer, the enigmatic Barrons, isn\u2019t someone I can trust. Everyone is lying to me, trying to play me for their own purposes. There\u2019s no one I can talk to about how this animal inside me makes me feel. What it\u2019s like to crave a pound of Unseelie flesh, in more ways than one. Who even am I? I want to wake up and discover that this fae congested world is just a frogging dream, but it isn\u2019t. I wake up most mornings with a cold inside me that runs so deeply I\u2019m afraid I may never get warm. Alina wouldn\u2019t even recognise the person I am now, that may be the worst part. I can handle the fae, I can handle the employer who is absentee at best but losing Alina: that is a reality that haunts me every day.

Mac is torn in so many different directions in this book, it's almost painful to read. None of the decisions she must make are easy, yet every one will have titanic consequences. She's seemingly being 'courted' by three different males, each of whom wants her for her ability to sense Hallows. In \"Faefever, she finds out a little bit more about each of them. There's V'lane, the death-by-sex fae who claims to want 'the Book' for his Queen to keep the walls between the worlds strong. There's the Lord Master, Mac's sister's old lover and ultimately killer, who needs the book to dissolve the walls but will keep Mac and her family safe and restore her dead sister to her with help from 'the Book'. Then there's Jericho Barrons. Every time Mac thinks she has him pegged, she discovers how little she really knows or understands him. Yet her attraction to him is always there. In Faefever, Mac finally spends some time with Christian MacKeltar--a Druid from a pretty impressive family lineage of Druids who battle to protect humanity by preserving the 'Compact' with the Fae Queen. But in the end, it all comes down to Mac. She's the only one alive who can sense the object/s they all want. Her actions affect not just herself and other Sidhe-seers but ultimately all humanity. The real issue is: Who can Mac trust? Or maybe more accurately: Can she trust any of them? I absolutely devoured this book. Didn't eat, didn't take a break (but did have to go to the bathroom once)! Now I'm strung out and strung up. I want to know...need to know what happens next. All I can do is wait for \"Dreamfever\" which is currently awaiting a release date but will likely be at least 9 months from now :( ...more Hope strengthens. Fear kills.

We start with a kind of cute Darkfever, then notice that the pink gradient gets a bit darker reaching Bloodvefer and then even darker with Faefever. I love it. I love darkness. I love pain. I love seeing a Mac in her toughest hours. See her suffer and toughen up. I like to see how life tests her limits and how she becomes someone else. Someone better. Someone stronger. A symbol for a genre. Mac is, in my opinion, one of the symbols of kick ass female leads in the urban fantasy genre. I think that Faefever is the best book in the Fever series so far, and trust me (I\u2019m a doctor) the next books will be even better. Don\u2019t get all scared and give up the series just because the ending was hard (heh). Three times hard. Or was it four? I can\u2019t help myself. I have to let it out. *clears throat* Yeah. In Dreamfever, you\u2019ll get a nice little treat to make up for this perversion. A VERY VERY nice treat. You\u2019ll see. *winks* P.S. Barrons, you disappointed me in this book.

Karen Marie Moning is one of them. I was introduced to her Highlander series a couple years ago and fell passionately in love with the characters and their happily-ever-after endings (not to mention the heart-pounding love scenes!) Her writing style is easy to read and a perfect mix of intelligence and comfortable colloquialism that makes it easy to approach without being full of typos and awkwardly structured sentences. I say that Karen Marie Moning is a romance author for the people who want some decent plot with their sex! Mix in some gorgeous men in kilts and an element of fantasy (time travel, druids, Fae Princes, some Berserkers, whatever) and you\u2019re good to go. All that being said, her Fever series is completely different. Faefever is the third in the series and I would strongly advise you NOT read out of order (Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever). Each subsequent installment of the series is closely tied in to the one before it and without that foundation, it would be very confusing. I would also categorize the first three books in this series as more \u201curban fantasy\u201d than \u201cparanormal romance\u201d so if you need a happy ending, these dark books might leave you feeling unfulfilled, at least for now. The main character, MacKayla Lane, is a ditzy southern belle who is forced to grow up fast. After her sister is brutally murdered while studying abroad, MacKayla (Mac for short) travels to Ireland to identify her sister\u2019s body and get some more information. She is unwittingly sucked into an unbelievably crazy subworld of Celtic myth that includes bad fairies, druids, dark hallows, evil plots, mystery and unfulfilled sexual desires with men of indeterminate scruples. Moning\u2019s fans have quickly learned that the author has the ability to write some unbelievably compelling cliffhangers and this installment was no different. The things I especially liked about this particular book: --Christian MacKelter (mmm, young druid man, I hope to see him get his own book in the Highlander series. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing V\u2019lane go the way of Adam Black and get his own either but that might be a stretch!) --the MacHalo (Mac made Barrons laugh, yay! Wow, total fangirl moment there.) --V\u2019lane dressing Mac in sleazy bikinis (hilarious, I could totally picture it) --learning more about the Lord Master --more clues about who/what Barrons is (dun, dun, dun!) The ending killed me *sad face* and I\u2019m OMGCAN\u2019TWAIT for the next book and desperately wish I hadn\u2019t discovered the series until all five had been published. So yes, my one recommendation would be that if you haven\u2019t started this series yet but think it sounds interesting, wait until they\u2019ve all been published unless you like being made mad crazy over a book. ...more 4.5 Stars There is so much going is this third book of the series that a full recap would be impossible.

The second reason was probably that cliffy of an ending sometimes it is really hard to read about (view spoiler) Nov 10 2013 edit After my re-read I'm upping my rating to 4.5 stars. So many things are foreshadowed and I think the 2 main reasons I had for a lower rating were that 1 Barrons and Mac didn't seem to have as much time together and I got a little focused on that since I really wanted more for their relationship and I needed to know who/what Barrons was and got no real answers this book. The second reason was probably that cliffy of an ending sometimes it is really hard to read about (view spoiler) [Rape (hide spoiler) ] no matter how well that author writes it and KMM did a fantastic job sometimes it is too much for me to handle the first time and I get all icky inside. On the re-read I didn't rush through Mac's time with V'lane while he was explaining about the Unsealie King, Queen and Faery. I took my time and really enjoyed the history he was telling Mac. I also enjoyed Mac's time with Christian and the other players on the board. I missed the subtle ways that parts of Mac's and Barrons relationship changed. He has become more possessive and protective of her in ways but still seems to try and give her space to become the woman she is supposed to be without smothering her. He offered to go with her to the Abby to see Rowena and the girls. He could tell someone died at his store but she said she didn't need him so he gave her space. He also followed her and went to where she was and sat outside just in case but for an Alpha male that concession is huge. Another big relationship moment came when Barron's felt betrayed by Mac and used Voice to find out everything she had been up to with the book. When he asked questions about V'lane you could tell how jealous he was and even though they never say it how much he wants her but is restraining himself. When I finished the book this time it didn't shock me as much and I really read through the scene and I think I better understand what the author was trying to portray in the story. All the events that lead up to the ending were executed phenomenally. Having already read books 4 and 5 I was able to pick out a few other details that hit me in the head like wow I should have really seen that coming. This series has been even better the second time through. I don't think I can say that for many series I've read. Miss KMM has definitely woven a very complicated and intricate skein and I'm loving every detail. 1st read review 3.5 Stars. The Fever series is becoming one of my favorites and this third installment is no exception to that. Faefever picks up right where we left Mac after she has glimpsed the book and how it is moving around. Wow let me just say I really didn't see that coming it was incredibly dark and well thought out. Mac is still trying to figure out who is on who's team. It is a struggle to figure out what is going on and who to trust. \u201cYou can\u2019t change an unpleasant reality if you won\u2019t acknowledge it, Mac. You can only control what you\u2019re willing to face. Truth hurts. But lies can kill.\u201d While the middle got a little repetitive for my taste and slowed down quite a bit the beginning and end were so good. I just missed Barrons and the banter for a lot of the book. Mac was distracted by the police still suspecting her of murder, Dani who is completely adorable and the other sidhe-seers and Christian Mackelter who is trying to help Mac is well. Of coarse the LM is still after Mac and V'lane keeps showing up trying to persuade Mac too. Everyone seems to want a piece of her. Mac has strong dark feelings for Barrons and since he doesn't particularly seem like the hero she isn't sure what to do with them. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear him behind me. I felt him. Electric. Wild. One foot in the swamp. Never going to crawl all the way out. And I wanted to have sex with whatever he was. Where was I supposed to put that in my head?\u201d There are still some great moments between Barrons and Mac. Also a lot of new information about the Fae comes out as the world building continues. The back-story is very intriguing and have enjoyed learning about this different world. The ending was such a huge cliffhanger and so dark that it left me panicked and wanting to jump headfirst into the next book. Miss Moning really dealt me a heavy blow and I pained for Mac. This wasn't the strongest book in the series for me but it definitely had some great action and the ending was phenomenal. I can't wait to discover what comes next. ...more **4.5 Stay to the Lights stars** Three powerful and dangerous men need Mac : \u2020 Barrons \u2020 V\u2019lane \u2020 Lord Master All three of these men want the same thing; Sinsar Dubh .

Somehow I found the will to stop myself from reading because I just couldn\u2019t believe that ending. I found that Faefever was a little slow sometimes. Moning has a knack for building scenes up and then just when you think something great or terrible or anything remotely shocking or whatever is about to happen, she cuts it off there and you end up feeling deflated and frustrated. This happens countless times within the book and there are times when I just want to bang my head, throw this book out the window and yell, Why, Moning Why!?! But then I go back after cooling down and keep reading, because that\u2019s what happens when you read a Fever book. Moning is just so skilled at teasing us with little glimpses and then leaving it at that. And for that, I may cry. Now on to the better things about this book... Let\u2019s face it. I read the Fever series for Barrons. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only female out there who feels this way. Every time I say the word \u201cBARRONS\u201d, mass hysteria and swooning usually follow. Every time I read the name Barrons in the book, I sit up in my chair a little straighter and devour the pages where he graces us with his presence because I feel like there\u2019s just not enough of him. The suspense and unanswered questions are killing me, just as they are with Mac. I need some answers! And speaking of Mac, I think she\u2019s just as strong as she was in the previous books. She\u2019s such a smart, patient girl. Her contacts with V\u2019lane and Inspector Jayne are paying off and I think she\u2019s dealing well with her grief. What I love about her is the fact that even though unexpected and dangerous things are happening all around her, she still finds the time to remember who she was before all this happened. She is still MacKayla Lane in her heart. And I just love the MACHALO scene. To be honest, I\u2019m kind of scared to read Dreamfever. After this rollercoaster ride, I\u2019m afraid of what I might find in the next book. But I need some damn answers. And I need them soon. ...more Reading this series has quite possibly been one of the best decisions I have ever made. Fo real.

Staying true to my non-spoiler-y reviews and intense love for basically anything Barrons-related, Imma tell you some of the reasons why I loved Faefever , and why you should definitely get your sweet petunia down to the bookshop! Or at least put it on your e-reader. THE CITY. I have superficially fallen in love with Dublin. The Dark Zones, the Temple Bar District, Trinity and BB&B. I love you fictional Dublin. MAC. Innocent. Sexually deviant. Totally vain. Loves pink. Insanely curious. Radiates total badassery. Gets to make out with Fae Princes and be in close proximity to Barrons all. The. Damn. Time. Mad girl crush. THE MEN. Imma just let KMM take over here. Excuse me while I go locate my panties. Barrons was powerful, broodingly good-looking, insanely wealthy, frighteningly intelligent, and had exquisite taste, not to mention a hard body that emitted some kind of constant low-level charge. Bottom line: he was the stuff of heroes. And psychotic killers. V'lane is gold and bronze, velvet and steel, and his eyes blaze with the stellar grandeur of a wintry night sky. He is so unearthly beautiful that it makes a part of my soul weep. A woman caught in a Fae prince's spell usually gets fucked to death. THE MACHALO. The coolestmotherfuckingthing ever. It's PINK. It's BRIGHT. It's so MAC. Fecking hell. Because every book in this series kicks my ass, I can never write constructive reviews. Only ranty ravey ones with heavy emphasis on Barrons and his fine ass. I ain't even ashamed. Fuck that ending tho. ...more", "Title": "Faefever"},
