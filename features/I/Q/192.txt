Consequently, I picked up Applebaum's book. Her book was precisely what I needed. She presents a very systematic explanation of the gulags in three sections: 1) the historical precedents prior to Stalin's regime and the rise of their power under Stalin; 2) Day-to-day life in the gulags; and 3) the dismantling of the Gulag's after Stalin's death and their diminishing presence through several other Soviet leaders and into 21st century Russia politics and judicial / penal system. At times the amount of detail was close to overwhelming, but Applebaum places all the facts into strong frameworks without losing the debates and ambiguity present in the field because of incomplete and missing information. She blends data, history, politics,<---M> personal history</---M>, and even a few exerpts from literary works to create her history. I expected to see cruelty depicted, but what shocked me the most was the arbitrary manner in which arrests, labor, torture and even releases were conducted. It would be maddening to live under a regime that weilded so much power in ways that were incomprehensible to its people. Anyone could be arrested and placed in labor / death camps: criminals, dissidents, and even members of the Communist party. Were the gulags so heavily populated because Stalin wanted cheap labor as a way to industrialize the Soviet Union? They never were cost effective. Was he trying to brow beat people into submission? They created strife between people and government. Was he trying to reform criminals and political dissidents? Few if none of the gulag prisoners became better people because of their time in the camps -- if they lived through it. The accounts made me wonder how human beings could descend into such irrational mistreatment of one another and made me wonder if such nonesense still persists in other countries - even in small ways (<---B>even in our own</---B>). Before this summer, I could fit everything I knew about the gulags on a postage stamp. Applebaum gave me a wealth of knowledge and much to ponder. I'm glad that I found this book -- even if her book was the antithesis of a \"summer read.\" ...more A third to a fourth remains when I write this. I have 8 hours left of 27 hours and 45 minutes!

I am chugging along, but I'll tell you <+++>Gulag: A History</+++> is an exceptionally hard read. The topic is dark, and I am usually fine with difficult subjects, but this proves to be harder than I thought! The book is VERY thorough. Chapter after chapter covering every possible aspect of the Gulag camps. I have read a lot previously on the topic. References are made to much of what I have read before.....and yet still there is more. The material presented is well organized. The author analyzes the evidence; she doesn't simply accept what is being said but compares information with other sources. Yet there is so much information you get drowned by the details and what is discussed is so very horrible. Here is one example of the meticulous analytical manner in which facts are studied. The food eaten in the camps is discussed, so of course food portions in grams must be listed too - for each and every prisoner type. On top of that the water content, which skews the nutrient content for the given weight, is documented. See what I mean by thorough?! Phew. Thoroughness on top of being a very difficult subject makes this a hard read. It is a clinically accurate and an encyclopedic tome. Tons of references to particular individual experiences. This I like. ******************************** On completion I want to re-emphasize what I noted above. The book is well organized, well researched, thorough, meticulously documented and encyclopedic in content. Multiple references to particular individuals' experiences are sited. Statements are not taken at face value; instead each is evaluated to discover the real truth. How is the book organized? There are three sections. The first covers how the camps came into being and developed with time. The central section covers life in the camps divided into chapters focusing on different themes, i.e. different aspects of the camps. Here are some examples of the themes: arrest, interrogations, incarceration in prisons, transport to the camps, intermediary transit camps. Once in the camps the following themes are equally meticulously documented - freedom of movement, classification of the incarcerated, bathing, dining, food, sleeping facilities, work, propaganda, punishment and reward, communication with the outside world, spiritual issues, criminals versus political prisoners, women and children and births and nurseries and sex and rape and prostitution and love and homosexuality...... I simply cannot list everything! What is essential to understand is that every aspect is meticulously documented. There are statistics and quotes from the incarcerated. The third section is about the dismantlement of the camps and the situation at the end of the 20th century. Finally there is an epilogue that focuses on why the author felt the book needed to be written. The first and the third section are in chronological order. Numerous references are made to authors such as Aleksandr Solzjenitsyn, Yevgenia Ginzburg, Osip Mandelstam, Andrej Sacharov, and others. I found the war years and the treatment of Poles, Crimean Tartars, Ukrainians, Chechens and other Caucasians, seen from the perspective of current events, particularly interesting. Also Putin\u2019s background. The book's organization and clear writing makes it easy to follow. BUT.....you can feel at points that you are drowning in all the information. It is like reading an encyclopedia section of over 600 pages. If I were writing a research paper, this would be a fantastic resource. It is itself a bit like a research paper. I would have appreciated a bit more editing. Even if it is easy to understand, it doesn't read as a book for the general public, in that it is so comprehensive! I do think there was a real need for such a book. How you rate a book depends on what you personally are looking for. My three star rating is by no means a judgment of the book\u2019s quality; my rating only shows my personal appreciation of the book. I liked it and would definitely recommend it to others, along with a word of warning that it is at times tedious and often relates horrible events. The narration of the audiobook by Laural Merlington was absolutely excellent. I cannot judge her Russian pronunciation. I liked the speed at which it was narrated and the ease at understanding each word. Clearly narrated. This is essential in a book of non-fiction. I am giving the narration five stars. ...more This is a fantastic book. It is a must-read for anyone who has any illusions about communism. It sucks. It is evil.

It is a must-read for anyone who has any illusions about communism. It sucks. It is evil. It belongs in the dustbin of history. Anne Applebaum tells the story of the gulag in fascinating detail, using newly available Soviet archives and published and unpublished memoirs from those who survived the camps. Their stories are chilling, to say the least. In the Introduction, Applebaum discusses the differences and similarities between the Nazi death camps and the Soviet camps. She also explains why so many on the Left were willing to excuse Soviet communism (and particularly Stalin) for its crimes. She then delves into a general history of the camps, explaining that they were, at heart, an economic enterprise. The first official camp, Solovetsky, spread out over a group of islands in the White Sea, was meant to be profitable. Later, Stalin insisted that the entire gulag must turn a profit, which it never did. But no one had had the guts to tell Stalin that. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Applebaum shows how many prisoners were used for grand construction projects like canals and railroads, with the predictably disappointing results and thousands of lives lost (suffice to say that OSHA would not be pleased with the working conditions). She writes how the camp system expanded throughout the 1930s until it obtained its permanent form. By 1940, hundreds of camps imprisoned millions of people, many of them criminals, many of them politicals, those whose only \"crime\" was some sort of dissent against Stalin and the Soviet Union. Many of these politicals were innocent, of course. In Part Two, in my opinion the heart and most compelling section of the book, Applebaum delves into the minutiae of the camps, chronicling prisoners' experiences through the arrest, transport, and imprisonment in the camps. This is where you get the sense of the monstrosity of the system and the government that ran it. Space doesn't permit me to go into all the details. Suffice to say that as a horror writer, there's enough material to write dozens of short stories and novels, with no need for any supernatural element to make them scary. In the third section, she switches back to general history and covers the rest of the 20th century, from the death of Stalin to the death of the Soviet Union. The gulag survived Stalin's death, but it did shrink as Soviet leaders were then free to address the unprofitably of the system. Many camps were closed and many prisoners were released, though many of those were later re-arrested. But the suppression continued. Innocents were still jailed for speaking out for freedom and still forced to endure hard labor in horrific conditions. This is the story of oppression on a massive scale. But it's also a collection of gritty and inspiring stories of survival by those lucky enough to live through the experience. Unfortunately, millions did not. ...more Jesus Christ. With the possible exception of a few books on the Holocaust, this is the single most painful work of non-fiction I've ever encountered. The portrait of the Soviet work camp system that Applebaum develops examines, in painfully minute detail, every single aspect of life in and around the Gulag system, from the highest levels of Soviet politburo administration, down to the lowliest starving, walking damned in the most far flung Siberian penal cell.

And she brings a staggering deluge of historical records and personal testimonies from people involved at all levels of the Gulag system to bare witness and de-mystify what was for decades an almost completely hidden world. And what a nightmare of a world it all was, all the more so because the criminal unfairness of the whole enterprise was never mandated, never required, never written into laws or decrees in any way, they just didn't care at all what really happened to all of these people they arrested for nothing and charged with nothing and shunted around the Russian wastes and sent to dig limestone out the arctic with their bare hands with no shelter or warm clothing... In some ways, and I doubt Applebaum intended this, this is a work of supreme political nihilism. It doesn't merely call into question the practical ramifications of the ideology of the soviet union/socialism, it calls into question the entire concept of sane, humane governance in the modern age period. As long as something this crushingly atrocious is able to sustain itself for decades on end, how can we possibly have faith in anything that any national entity ever does? ...more A 5 star read without a doubt.

As a young girl I heard stories of my grandfather having been in a \"labor camp\" but until I read this, I never knew what that really meant. My family knew a dissident who vacationed in the same resort we did every year, until I read this I truly did not understand what that meant either. Of course, we all can intellectually know what that means but Applebaum brings it to light on so many levels. I feel like I had the best Russian history lesson yet was emotionally engaged the whole time. What better way to learn about history?! Anne Applebaum is truly a talented writer. It is evident how well-researched this book is and she is able to present it in such a wonderfully engaging and readable format. Speaking for myself, other than knowing that labor camps existed, I had NO idea to the extent and to the length of time they existed. I am sure I am not alone in this and this book brings so much to our understanding of the world. I feel it is a very important contribution to history and a wonderful memorial to those who experienced these miserable situations. I feel it also brings an understanding of the Russian people both past and present.

With the quality of life that prisoners had to endure and how unprepared both they and their captures were I am surprised that so many people survived to tell their tales. I had no issues with the history, it was extremely well researched but the layout of the book held a few issues for me. Part 1 was a great introduction but I found Part 2 was a bit confusing as it switched from years and camps with such rapidity. I couldn't always remember what had happened in that year or that camp as it switched from subject to subject. But I loved the epilogue and the summation was very thought provoking. The story was depressing and shocking and disturbing. At the same time it was fascinating, enthralling and makes me want to know even more about the legacy of Lenin, Stalin and the Communist Party. ...more In one of my college history classes, a student asked the professor who killed more people - Stalin or Hitler?

If life in the camps was horrible, unbearable, inhuman, if death rates were high--that too was hardly surprising. In certain periods, life in the Soviet Union was also horrible, unbearable, and inhuman, and death rates were as high outside the camps as they were within them.\" Applebaum argues through the narrative--describing heartbreaking transits on boats full of mass rape and murder to desolate corners of the USSR; families shattered as spouses break it off at conjugal \"House of Meetings\" visits and orphans end up on the streets as a festering class of homeless/brutal/carnal criminals; and the awful/truly gross things people would do to smuggle grain alcohol into the camps--that when there were periods war and famine outside the system deaths inside it would spike. Along the way, there are some very interesting historical gems, too. I've been to Joint Base Dix-McGuire-Lakehurst many times, but I didn't know that in 1945 145 Russian prisoners of war housed there rioted and killed themselves rather than go back to the USSR and atone for their collaboration with the Nazis via the Gulag. I didn't know that in 1944 U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace visited the camp at Kolyma and was completely duped Potemkin-style into thinking it was a worker's paradise in \"the Wild West of Russia\". I learned that if you're a fat guy and two other prisoners suddenly invite you to do a big cross-country escape opportunity you're probably going to get eaten. I think that, after accompanying Applebaum on this well-researched history--meeting Solzhenitsyn, seeing the comparisons and contrasts to the Nazis' camps, and watching the ways that every Soviet leader after Stalin's death tried to deal with this system that absolutely wasted so much blood and treasure--that the ugliest but most useful part of this book occurs in the epilogue. After describing all the soul-searching and efforts to heal that took place in Germany in the wake of the Holocaust (which are ongoing, by the way), she points out that \"Half a century after Stalin's death, there were no equivalent arguments taking place in Russia, because memory of the past was not a living part of public discourse... the goal has been to end discussion of the past, to pacify the victims by throwing them a few extra rubles and free bus tickets, and to avoid any deeper examination of the causes of Stalinism or of its legacy.\" While Applebaum laments the fact that Russians don't want to talk about the crimes of the past, she doesn't let the other Cold War camp off easy, either: \"Already, we are forgetting what it was that mobilized us, what held the civilization of \"the West\" together for so long: we are forgetting what it was that we were fighting against. If we do not try harder to remember the history of the other half of the European continent, the history of the other twentieth-century totalitarian regime, in the end it is we in the West who will not understand our past, we who will not know how our world came to be the way it is.\" I found this book insightful and interesting, if a little depressing (I read it in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, one of the most beautiful places in the world, so that I could occasionally take a reality break from the uglier bits in the pages like forced feedings and self-mutilation) and I think that its subject matter is timely, given what we're seeing lately in the international news. ...more I probably never will get all of, \"Gulag,\" read.

A key question which must arise in the minds of most American readers is how and why we know and hear so much of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany's assault upon millions of people, but we know and hear so little of the Gulag. There is at least one important distinction. The German camps came to be outright death camps; people were herded to mass executions. The Soviets - by no means benign - did maintain their camps (mostly) as labor/banishment camps, albeit untold millions died of the cruelty and inhumanity which became their lot. There were no trials of the Gulag perpetrators or the guards or the informers. There were no state probes or official inquiries. When at last the Gulag ended, it was done. With exceptions (with Applebaum's notable exception), the Gulag was not even history. In part this may explain - incredible - Josef Stalin \"deported the Chechen nation to the wastes of Kazakhstan where half of them died and the rest were meant to disappear, with their language and culture.\" Then - twice in the 1990s - the Russian federation launched wars against the Chechen people, killed tens of thousands, and destroyed the Chechen capital of Grozny. Applebaum notes this is the moral equivalent of Germany invading Poland twice in the 1990s. Focus on the Gulag and its consequences becomes withering. ...more She's a fine journalist, but she's no historian.

I'm still waiting for the book that can give me what feels like real insight into the phenomenon of early-to-mid-century European social and political tumult. But maybe I will just have to dig it out for myself from fact-packed tomes like this one (given that I'm limited to English-language sources). Also, she does a pretty good job of not letting her own political biases take over (they are there, particularly if you know her background, or are sensitive to clues) but she seems to be letting facts speak for themselves on the whole. I would say, howver, that her conclusions in the epilogue are not well supported. Also, the prose, while certainly readable, can be clunky. ...more Among the best accounts of Stalin's system of concentration and labor camps that I know of. She describes not only the organization, operations of the camps as well as life within them, but she also explains the role of slave labor in the development of the Soviet economy and in war production. Very well written, and entirely engaging - despite the horror in the tale. Clearly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize that she was awarded - if I recall correctly. Eye opening. Amazing how this part of history seems to be left alone, especially in the West. Applebaum acknowledges this when she visits the prisons on her own. An interesting read and one that includes the power that literature and poetry has when many great Russian writers were finally able to get their works pertaining to these camps published decades later.

They didn\u2019t just want to oppress us; they wanted us to thank them for it.\u201d This is a book that is horrific in scope as it details the history of the Gulag in the Soviet Union from its beginnings under Lenin. The author, who writes with great eloquence, takes us through the various stages of what occurred. The Gulag itself was a vast slave labour system that had two basic purposes: to incarcerate anyone who was perceived as a threat to the system and to use the slave labourers (the prisoners) to industrialize and modernize the Soviet Union \u2013 to build roads and railroads, work in mines, chop down trees for lumber \u2013 in other words to exploit the almost endless resources of the country. Ms. Applebaum takes us through the entire sequence of events: the arrest, interrogation, imprisonment, transport to a camp, and the camp itself. Millions passed through this system, some more than once. When examined individually these steps could be compared to imprisonment in other countries \u2013 for instance the food is atrocious. But it is the vast scale of the Gulag that sets it apart - not only in terms of human dignity, but as a crime against there own citizens. One aspect that is beyond the compare is the transport to the labour camps. Many would die during this long journey to the outer reaches of the Soviet Union where they could be locked in cattle cars or the bottom of ships and given little food and clothing. Many of the prisons were in the far north where the prisoners were forced to work long hours in the cold with inadequate clothing and small rations, even in the summer they were decimated by hordes of mosquitoes. Of interest is that the camps were controlled by the Russian mob which has a long history, as they started in the days of the Czar. These real criminals held brutal sway over the political prisoners. The number and types of prisoners were vast \u2013 \u201cpolitical\u201d prisoners, exiles (as in a national group relocated for ethnic cleansing) consisting over the years of Poles, Lithuanians, Chechens, religious people, kulaks... One is never quite sure of the distinction between an exile and prisoners \u2013 in remote locations neither, due to geography, had freedom of movement. Maybe prisoners had an advantage because they were fed, usually with a bowl of watery soup. Page 421 in 1939 With no warning, the NKVD had plucked these newcomers \u2013 Poles, Ukrainians, Belorussians, and Moldavians \u2013 out of their bourgeois or peasant worlds after the Soviet invasion of multiethnic eastern Poland, Bessarabia, and the Baltic States, and dumped them in large numbers, into the Gulag and exile villages. What is most sad and atrocious is the treatment of the children (which I dare say was even worse than the way women were treated). They were at the bottom of the ladder in a \u201csociety\u201d where work was rewarded with food. Page 333 Decades of propaganda, of posters draped across orphanage walls, thanking Stalin \u201cfor our happy childhood\u201d, failed to convince the Soviet people that the children of the camps, the children of the streets, and the children of the orphanages had ever become anything but full-fledged members of the Soviet Union\u2019s large and all-embracing criminal class. Ms. Appleton humanizes all with emotional quotes from several people, including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Varlam Shalamov . The author discusses how the Gulag changed after Stalin. For instance, during the Brezhnev era Joseph Brodsky (a poet) was arrested and imprisoned on charges of \u201cparasitism\u201d. This book furthered my understanding of the Soviet Union and its\u2019 successor Russia. This is not a book of numbers. It is intense and extremely well written. We are provided not just with a history of the Gulag, but of the entire country. Highly recommended for any who are interested in this important historical era. As the author mentions, it gives us another view of the Cold War \u2013 and why there was a Cold War.

Ik weet dat de dingen die in het boek staan grotendeels echt gebeurd zijn, maar het leest weg als een Kafka-esque beschrijving van de Inferno. Het is bizar hoe normaal corruptie, marteling, diefstal en moord toen waren. Hoe normaal het was om mensen te reduceren tot minder dan mensen, tot objecten. Dat je naar een strafkamp werd verbannen als je drie keer te laat op je werk kwam, dat je dan in de isoleercel gegooid kon worden als je je overhemd niet helemaal had dichtgeknoopt. Hier een paar voorbeelden van dingen die echt gebeurden: Verhaal #1: als twee gevangenen wilden ontsnappen, namen ze een derde mee. Deze wist het zelf niet maar hij was lopende proviand. Wanneer onderweg het eten op was dan was het de bedoeling dat de twee hem dood zouden maken en zijn vlees zouden verdelen en opeten. Verhaal #2: om alcohol het kamp binnen te smokkelen lieten ze iemand een condoom inslikken met daaraan een buis. de buis stak dan half uit de mond. via die buis werd dan zo'n 3 liter alcohol in het condoom gepompt. in het kamp konden ze daar weer 7 liter wodka van maken. ging er onderweg iets mis dan stierf de koerier aan alcoholvergiftiging, anders werd hij binnengehaald als held. Verhaal #3: het noorden was in de winter compleet bevroren. in de korte zomers werd alles een groot moderrig moeras en stikte het er van de muggen. een straf was om een gevangenen naakt aan een boom vast te binden tussen al die muggen. daar werden ze gestoken tot ze flauw viel van het tekort aan bloed. En zo kan ik nog wel een tijdje doorgaan. Het boek zit er vol mee. Het hele systeem heeft vanaf ergens in de jaren '20 (Solovetsky in 1923) tot ver in de jaren tachtig bestaan (waar ze in Perm nog dissidenten opsloten). Stalin was een hevig gelover in dwangarbeid om mensen te beteren en om het land vooruit te helpen. Niemand durfde hem te vertellen dat dat allebei niet echt lukte. Na zijn dood (in 1953) werd de boel wel milder onder Beria, Kruschev (niet onder Andropov) en uiteindlijk kwam er een eind aan onder Gorbachev. In Rusland wordt er niet veel meer over de Gulag gepraat. Weinig mensen weten er meer dan een beetje van, er wordt nauwelijks over gepraat en er wordt al helemaal geen recht gedaan. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is dat Rusland nu nog wordt geregeerd door de mensen die toen \u2018fout\u2019 waren. Poetin (Bush zijn friend, Vladimir) is zelf een ex-KGB agent. De communisten van toen hebben er veel belang bij om de waarheid te begraven. Het falen om de misdadigers van toen te berechten en de verzetshelden te eren werkt nu nog door in de samenleving. Hier in het Westen is de volledige lading helemaal niet bekend. Er waren hier mensen die voor het communisme waren en de kampen ontkenden maar het is waarschijnlijk tot niemand doorgedrongen hoe fout dat soort mensen eigenlijk waren. Achteraf bekeken is die Koude Oorlog dus ontzettend terecht geweest. Applebaum eindigt daarom pessimistisch met: [\u2026] For if we go on forgetting half of Europe's history, some of what we know about mankind itself will be distorted. Every one of the twentieth-century's mass tragedies was unique: the Gulag, the Holocaust, the Armenian massacre, the Nanking massacre, the Cultural Revolution, the Cambodian revolution, the Bosnian wars, among many others. Every one of these events had different historical, philosophical and cultural origins, every one arose in particular local circumstances which will never be repeated. Only our ability to debase and destroy and dehumanize our fellow man has been \u2014 and will be \u2014 repeated again and again: our transformation of our neighbours into \u2018enemies\u2019, our reduction of our opponents to lice or vermin or poisonous weeds, our re-invention of our victims as lower, lesser or evil beings, worthy only of incarceration or expulsion or death. The more we are able to understand how different societies have transformed their neighbours and fellow citizens from people into objects, the more we know of the specific circumstances which led to each episode of mass torture and mass murder, the better we will understand the darker side of our own human nature. This book was not written \u2018so that it will not happen again\u2019, as the clich\u00e9 would have it. This book was written because it almost certainly will happen again. Totalitarian philosophies have had, and will continue to have, a profound appeal to many millions of people. Destruction of the \u2018objective enemy\u2019, as Hannah Arendt once put it, remains a fundamental object of many dictatorships. We need to know why \u2014 and each story, each memoir, each document in the history of the Gulag is a piece of the puzzle, a part of the explanation. Without them, we will wake up one day and realize that we do not know who we are. ...more I was just going to give it five stars and write, \"Gulag!

People were sentenced to years in the Gulag for such \"crimes\" as being late to work, or because someone informed on them, or for literally nothing at all. Some people were sentenced in the '30s, served their sentences or were released through amnesties during the war, and then were re-arrested in '48 when Stalin began a new wave of repression. They lived in inhuman conditions and were worked to death. The magnitude of the suffering is almost incomprehensible. I could go on, but I'll just say that the book was excellent in readability and scope. It gave me an understanding of a subject that was previously very vague to me. There are still forced labor camps in North Korea and China; they are direct descendants of the Gulag. ...more An absolutely brilliant and crucially important work, which details the history of the Soviet Gulag system of forced labor camps, from the end of the First World War to the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Exhaustively researched and containing numerous reminiscences from camp survivors, and details from official government archives, Anne Applebaum presents a picture of Soviet repression that is equal parts horrifying, sobering, educational, and nearly beyond belief. This is an important work for what it teaches us historically, for the lessons it brings to us about the reality of evil, for what it tells us about ourselves, and for the hope it gives that, with understanding, perhaps future descents into the horrors of ideological and political violence and repression can be mitigated, if not avoided altogether. I strongly, strongly recommend this book. ...more La investigaci\u00f3n es impecable, con una explicaci\u00f3n que acude todo el tiempo a datos, contexto y citas para instalar el por qu\u00e9, c\u00f3mo, d\u00f3nde y para qu\u00e9 de tanto (tanto, tanto) horror.

Applebaum presents a strong, unblinking examination of the history of the Soviet gulag, the system of Communist prison camps that in Solzhenitsyn\u2019s metaphoric naming spread across the Soviet Union in a vast archipelago of intentional brutality, targeted murder, malign indifference, exposure, overwork, disease, deprivation, and starvation. Everything, including the heroically stubborn survival of prisoners suffering the insufferable, enduring the unendurable, and simply outlasting this rarely mitigated evil, is hard to read but necessary for understanding. The gulag\u2019s inmates were political opponents, real and imagined, of Stalin. They were random citizens turned in for telling a joke or making a disparaging remark about Soviet leaders or the Soviet system\u2014or for listening to someone else make a joke or a remark. Others were citizens who were merely suspected of something because they received mail from abroad, spoke a language other than Russian or bought something on the black market. Other prisoners were reported to authorities by someone who was angry or jealous of them for any reason; and still others were implicated by friends, colleagues or acquaintances in response to interrogations about non-existent conspiracies. There were also criminals in the camps, thieves and murderers and sexual predators, who sometimes were allowed to or were used by camp wardens to victimize the political prisoners. And at times there were spouses and children of political prisoners, swept up for the crime of being family members of \u201can enemy of the people.\u201d The gulag existed from immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution until the collapse of the Soviet Union, though it was at its worst during the reign of Stalin. For many of its original prisoners it was surprisingly familiar because as revolutionaries themselves (Mensheviks, anarchists, socialists, etc.) they had spent time in the czarist prisons. But the Soviet gulag was worse than its czarist model. Periodic purges resulted in mass executions, particularly but not exclusively in the Great Terror of 1937 and 1938. For all of Stalin\u2019s reign the work camps were a significant, if totally unsuccessful, part of the Soviet economy. Prisoners were slave labor with unreachable quotas of work to be attained under extreme conditions with crude and inadequate tools. Food rations were close to minimal levels to avoid starvation and those who didn\u2019t meet quotas were fed below minimal level. Disease and death were rampant. During periods of famine and after the Nazi invasion, when conditions were so awful that millions of free Soviet citizens died from cold, starvation, and related diseases, life, of course, was even worse in the camps. Applebaum tries to put verifiable figures on all of this but documentation, the methodology and reliability of record keeping, in the camps makes that challenging. Applebaum\u2019s relentless research and interview efforts are inspiring\u2014if you are wondering how difficult is it to read almost 600 pages of such unimaginable brutality, pause to consider how difficult it is to spend intense years examining the histories, memoirs, documents, and oral accounts of this dark, decades-long era of evil. Pause further to consider how we can adequately understand and remember what happened if all we know is a simple, brief textbook summary? You can\u2019t. Anne Applebaum\u2019s Gulag, A History is essential reading for any meaningful understanding of the 20th century. ...more \u8001\u5927\u54e5\u4f1a\u68a6\u89c1\u53e4\u62c9\u683c\u5417\uff1f\uff01

For many years the Gulag provided Russia / The Soviet Union with much of its labor force. I had always assumed that the Gulag was a prison system for political prisoners or criminals, but I didn\u2019t realize that they were really used to produce product that the Soviet Union would then either use or sell to other countries. It really was a form of slavery. I had also imagined that the Gulags were in the most remote and inhospitable parts of the country, primarily Siberia. That is true in some cases, however the book outlines dozens of other locations of the Gulags and they were all over the country. They were placed at strategic sites, to facilitate harvesting of lumber, mining, industrial factories, etc. People were arrested for all sorts of reasons and \u201ccrimes\u201d and if the Gulag system needed additional manpower, there would be a surge in arrests. It was also interesting to note that many of the Gulag communities were very lax, and allowed co-mingling between males and females, and surprisingly some people led very normal lives albeit within the Gulag system. On the contrary, there were other stories that painted a very sad story of families, spouses, children being torn away from each other. It was hard to fathom. It was eye opening to see how people in one part of the world spent the last century, and grateful that I live in a place where this isn\u2019t (at least not yet) the status quo. ...more A needed history. Better than the Eastern European scholarship. But with enough shortcomings. And the text is tuned here and there, 'bolshaya zona' does not mean 'big prison zone'. Also the reasoning is quite shallow. People would wear Nazi emblems the same way they wear Communist emblems. Only there are laws that punish that and the public is much helped by some anti-nazi groups, while there is nothing against Communism. So much for the observation of Rambo vs Schindler's List. Comprehensive and informative, but not much new here. Still, Applebaum gives us a good account of a horrific system of forced labor that was totally uneconomical. The entire system promoted the proliferation of falsified statistics and generally worthless projects. It was also interesting how strong the economic motivations for the system were, both for the Bolsheviks and later Stalin. Applebaum shows both the logistics and horrors of the gulag system, as well as the stupidity of it. In a chapter Comprehensive and informative, but not much new here. Still, Applebaum gives us a good account of a horrific system of forced labor that was totally uneconomical. The entire system promoted the proliferation of falsified statistics and generally worthless projects. It was also interesting how strong the economic motivations for the system were, both for the Bolsheviks and later Stalin. Applebaum shows both the logistics and horrors of the gulag system, as well as the stupidity of it. In a chapter titled \"Bolshevik Beginnings\", Applebaum tries to trace the development of correctional labor following the October Revolution. But there was nothing extraordinary about the Soviet correctional labor facilities in the context of Russia or elsewhere. Up to the late 19th century, England banished more than 150 thousand people to Australia to work in labor colonies. In Russia, going back to the Romanov dynasty, forced labor was used to build the city of Saint Petersburg, ports, canals, and roads. However, the gulag system was never really consolidated and fully established until Stalin came to power. NKVD mass arrests were quite arbitrary in terms of who they arrested, but this was also because the NKVD was often poorly informed and equipped--plus they had to meet quotas regardless of individual guilt or innocence. Unlike what the Nazis did, there was no intent on the part of the Soviet government to harm the prisoners. The Soviet labor system was oriented towards keeping its labor force in adequate condition for hard work in order to fulfill construction plans handed down from above. Camp authorities had a stake in keeping workers healthy so that their plans could be met. In the 1930s, the government issued orders to ensure adequate levels of food and living conditions. The authorities in fact developed motivation systems, although this included fear and punishment, and the like.. Like with the entire Soviet population, life became hard for the workers during the war. The majority of fatalities in the Gulag occurred in the period 1941-43 when the country faced extreme hardships. Applebaum argues that the Soviet correctional labor facilities qualified as concentration camps because people were imprisoned on the basis of their identity rather than their actions. Still, a good number of workers in the camps were convicted of non-political crimes like hooliganism, banditry, and misconduct in office. Applebaum dismisses these facts: \"A woman who has picked a few pieces of grain from a field is not a criminal, nor is a man who has been late to work.\", which shows a lack of research about the relevant policies. Concerning workers' absenteeism, the stiffest punishment for those absent from work without excuse for more than six months amounted to brief a term of punitive labor without imprisonment. Applebaum claims that the number of genuine professional criminals was \"tiny\"(p.582). But In the mid 1950s, after both political and common prisoners were released from the labor camps, crime would grow steadily in the following decades, as criminals found it possible to cultivate a younger generation of professionals. Applebaum alleges that declassified NKVD archives on the labor camps contain unreliable data: \"camp commanders had a vested interest in lying about how many of their prisoners died\"(p.583). Applebaum does not understand the data in concern, as the historian Stephen Wheatcroft has shown in his academic work. The Soviet correctional labor department, as Wheatcroft explains, was complex and needed an extensive record-keeping system to do its work. Wheatcroft concludes that there are no intrinsic grounds to conclude that the the NKVD's archival reports greatly distort what went on. For example, as Wheatcroft explains, when officials were pleading for more supplies they had no incentive to underestimate the number of prisoners. Applebaum speculates that a great number of prisoners were released when on the verge of dying. She puts forth no proof to back up this claim. The data that she tries to discredit does not have any implausible elements. In the 1930s, the death rate was about two to three higher in the labor camps compared to the Soviet population as a whole. It greatly increased due to the hardships of the war and then sunk to a level on par with the rest of the Soviet population. Contrary to Applebaum's confusion, archival data from the NKVD shows that roughly half of all sentences for political crimes did not exceed five years. Often, these sentences were commuted. Large numbers of workers were released from the correctional labor camps not because they were about to die but simply because their term ended. None of this means we can downplay or or justify the use of slave labor by the communists. The use of forced labor by the communists was never much of a secret, nor was it humane or even logical. ...more Anne Applebaum's Gulag is the next natural choice of reading if one, even remotely, enjoyed reading Solzhenitsyn's One Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich, which I did tremendously, and has the curiosity to explore the immense quasi-legal prison system of the Soviet Union.

The book is very detailed, chronicling the founding and often illogical reasons that Lenin and Stalin's regimes had for wanting to incarcerate such a large prison system, most of which were essentially very inefficient slave-labour complexes. Despite the vast coverage the book provides, both from the administrative and prisoners' viewpoint, it is not the least bit dry and removed, but on the contrary, very human. The author also does a good job in highlighting the contrasts between the Soviet gulag system and the Nazi concentration camps, both of which had very different goals and a different culture, although people suffered all the same in them. However, what interested me which wasn't quite clear was that, even though the majority of the POWs ended up in camps ran by the NKVD, whether the Red Army ran their own prison camps, and if they did, if those were any different from the ones ran by the NKVD. In Nazi Germany, the treatment of POWs was quite different depending if one was placed in a camp ran by the Wehrmacht or Gestapo. An interesting tidbit that I picked up which seemed obvious yet that so completely non-intuitive was that there actually was a significant number of Japanese prisoners incarcerated there. One could almost forget that Soviets and Japanese fought during WW2 as they only did so in the last few months for a very short period. Looking into this, it seems that some historians believe that the Soviet's rapid advance into Japan played a role as significant as the dropping of the atomic bombs in the surrender, something that is hardly mentioned at all in history textbooks that I've read. This topic is definitely worth looking further into. ...more<---C>Anne Applebaum</---C>", "Title": "Gulag: A History"},
