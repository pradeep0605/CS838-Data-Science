Whatever it was that brought on this knee jerk purchase seems to have mercifully left me with enough common sense to say I will not be continuing on with this series. Recently I discovered Introducing an even more abusive and disturbing TWILIGHT! Now with whips and chains! Fifty Shades of Shit Haters, please exit stage left. I'm not sure what possessed me to pick up <+++>Fifty Shades of Grey</+++>. I thought I might genuinely like it before I started, but all I was left with was one hell of a mindfuck. Whatever it was that brought on this knee jerk purchase seems to have mercifully left me with enough common sense to say I will not be continuing on with this series. Recently I discovered one of my favorite publishers,<---M> Random House</---M>, has picked up Fifty Shades of Grey and made this statement: \"An orig\u00adi\u00adnal work, and said to us that James had war\u00adranted the books were, indeed orig\u00adi\u00adnal. Mes\u00adsitte added she was \u201caware of the nar\u00adra\u00adtive that [50\u00a0SHADES] started as dif\u00adfer\u00adently titled piece of fic\u00adtion, but that they were and are two dis\u00adtinctly sep\u00ada\u00adrate pieces of\u00a0work.\" I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to call bull shit on that. Fifty Shades of Grey and Master of the Universe (<---B>the original fan fic</---B>) are essentially the same thing. The biggest difference being Edward and Bella's name being replaced with Christian and Anastasia respectively. And I would know this because I have both and while I was reading, I would occasionally switch back and forth between the two without difficulty. I'd go through and give you examples myself, but other people have done it already here and here . So if you must read this book, do yourself a solid and find the fan fic online. You even get the second book too! I know some people claim this has no similarities to Twilight and got dammit, I'm allergic to all the bull shit. Do I really need to point this all out? Because it looks pretty obvious to me. The mannerisms of the characters are exactly the same. They even say similar things the original characters say. The whole \"dazzle\" line and Edward asking Bella to trust him. Her mother being remarried with the same inability to maneuver her way around a kitchen. Bella is still trying to save Edward from himself due to his troubled past. Edward still stalks and controls Bella, only now he gets to hit her when she gets out of line. *facepalm* Shall I beat them both? Yes? I struggled to come up with a proper review for this book and couldn't figure out why I was feeling rather uninspired to write one.<---F> And then I figured it out</---F>. I was left so disgusted by this book that I wanted to purge the memory of its existence from my mind. With a rusty nail. Every time I thought of the book my brain cells would go on strike, yelling obscenities at me. \u00a0Anyway, I thought Bella and Edward's relationship couldn't get anymore fucked up than Twilight. I stand corrected. If I were to describe FSoG in one sentence it would be this: Fifty Shades of Grey is like Twilight on steroids, high on ecstasy, in a dirty little corner. A very dirty corner. With badly written sex. Lots. Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex... Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of the beautiful (but of course she doesn't know it), naive virgin, Anastasia Steal after she is suckered into interviewing the Greek god, Christian Grey. Of course, sparks fly and for some unknown reason he can't seem to stay away from this incredibly, unremarkable girl. \u00a0Ana discovers Christian is into BDSM and desires her as his submissive fuck buddy. There are a myriad of problems with this novel, many of which ironically can be found in Twilight. Never saw that one coming! Christian/Edward is still a controlling bastard, only now he hides behind his BDSM practices to camouflage his abusive tendencies. However, Ana doesn't see it that way. She thinks of him as a broken person and it's her duty to fix him. Even when he says things like this: \"I want to hurt you. But not beyond anything you couldn't take.\" Can you believe she let's him beat her after that? And please don't even bother to tell me that it's just BDSM. No, just fucking no. Ana is genuinely afraid of Christian and is never entirely comfortable with the \"punishment\" aspect of their relationship. But Christian just manipulates her with sex to continue the relationship. And that's what really gets me. I just have a hard time believing a virgin would somehow become a sex goddess overnight, because that is exactly what happens. When she first is introduced to his kinky lifestyle and tells him she is a virgin he immediately tells her he needs to handle that \"situation\" before they could continue. What?! Since when is your virginity a \"situation?\" But, that's not really the kicker. Oh, no, because that is when we are introduced to Ana's two best friends. Everyone say hi to: Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex... Anna's inner goddess, who always cheers her on when Christian wants sex or wants to punish her. She's also quite annoying, doing back flips at the mention of anything sexual related. Simmer down. Where did she come from exactly? Ana is in her twenties and has never felt the urge to have sex with anyone until Christian comes along with his whips and chains?! And... Ana's sub-conscious, who hides behind couches when it comes time for her beating. When it comes to Ana having sex with Christian, well, her sub-conscious only has one thing to say, So after the \"situation\" is handled, Ana has to sign a \"contract\" agreeing to his sexual demands and also outlining things she won't do. It was pretty pointless considering he still got what he wanted and she never signed the damn thing. He exploits her, stalks her and abuses her! She cries after sex. She is afraid of him being angry! Even when he is angry at something else, she thinks it's her. Her reasoning for allowing him to hit her as his therapy is because she's afraid to lose him. That is not a reason for agreeing to a BDSM lifestyle! In fact, that's not even really \"consent!\" These quotes just scream domestic abuse to me: \"Please don't be angry with me,\" I whisper. \"Please don't hit me,\" I whisper, pleading. His brow furrows, his eyes widening. He blinks twice. \"I don't want you to spank me. Not here. Not now. Please don't.\" Yeah, he's a real catch, that one. Barf. No, excuse me. That's not right. The barfing came when the little ass-wipe PULLED HER TAMPON OUT AND RAMMED HIMSELF INSIDE OF HER. OMFG. Yes, the caps were totally necessary because that was the most disgusting thing I have ever had the misfortune of reading. That is not sexy, that's foul. Whenever Ana thinks about leaving him, he comes over to her apartment unannounced pounds into her (literally) and her inner goddess does a fucking happy dance, forgetting her urge to kick his sick ass to the curb. They fight, they breakup. They kiss, they sex up. Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex... Christian: \"Do you still want me gone Ana?\" Inner goddess: *growl* Sub-conscious: ... Dance, puppet. Dance. The writing is a shitty mess too. I mean, if I had to sit and read Ana saying \"Holy, shit!\" or \"Holy, Fuck!\" or \"Oh, my!\" one more time, I was going to lose it. I wanted to take my red pen and have at this \"book\" so badly. It was the little things like Ana's roommate saying over and over, \"You never cry Ana,\" and what do we find Ana always doing? Crying. I'm not sure where the hell the plot was. *smacks forehead* How silly of me! Didn't I mention this was a Twilight retelling? Why was I expecting a plot?\u00a0And another example of poor writing: for these characters to be American, they sounded very British to me. They used phrases that Americans don't use. And now I'm trying to figure out why this book is so popular. Why do so many women love this book? I get the appeal of the bondage even though it's not my usual cup of tea. Whips? Chains? Sounds exciting! Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex... Abuse? Not so much. Fuck my life! Zero stars! Eh, I'm off to read a good book now and possibly to bleach my brain.

This review is in no way meant to belittle or condemn you for liking these books, and nor is it an attack on the author. These are solely MY OPINIONS about how dangerous FSoG is to society and specifically to women. Needless to say, this book does not fulfill one of my fantasies. It\u2019s pretty much my biggest nightmare. \u201cBut it\u2019s just fiction!\u201d No. You can\u2019t use that argument with me. Not anymore. This book is not \u201cjust fiction\u201d. This book has become a frigging phenomenon. As I write this, over 70 million copies have been sold in the United States alone, hardware stores have run out of \u201cnatural fiber\u201d rope and there are even \u2018BDSM for Beginners\u2019 classes cropping up in small town America. So excuse me, but I can\u2019t just read this and think of it like a fantasy, not when it\u2019s become a reality for so many people, and not when I was so enraged by what I found within it. Okay everyone, take a deep breath, grab a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and settle in. We\u2019re going to be here for a while. First up is probably the most inflammatory of the statements I\u2019m going to make, so we might as well rip the band aid off. THIS BOOK PERPETUATES THE RAPE CULTURE WE WERE ALL RAISED IN. There, I\u2019ve said it. I\u2019m not taking it back and I\u2019m not apologizing. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with this phrase, allow me to elaborate. Wikipedia defines rape culture as: \u201cA term used within women's studies and feminism, describing a culture in which rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media condone, normalize, excuse, or encourage sexualized violence.\u201d Let\u2019s look at the first half of that definition. As much as we may want to ignore the facts, rape and sexual violence are common in America. According to RAINN , the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual violence organization, someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. On average that\u2019s about 207,754 sexual assaults each year. 54% of sexual assaults are not reported, 97% of rapists will never spend a day in jail and 2/3 of these assaults are committed by someone known to the victim. I could go on for days about how prevalent attitudes, practices, and the media condone sexual violence, but I won\u2019t because I\u2019m really going to try and keep my words and links relevant to FSoG. Thankfully, throughout my research, I found several\u2026hundred. The University of California has an interesting article about how social and cultural norms perpetuate rape and rape culture. In it, they specifically address how women are conditioned from early ages to be passive and accept and affect certain attitudes and behaviors. Here are some of the social rules they list and elaborate on: 1. When spoken to, a woman must acknowledge the other person with a gracious smile. 2. Women must answer questions asked of them. 3. Women must not bother other people or make a scene because they are uncomfortable. 4. When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men. 5. Casual touching or suggestive comments in social settings are meant as a tribute to a woman\u2019s desirability. 6. It is the natural state of affairs for men to carry the financial burden of social situations. 7. When engaged in a social encounter, it is not proper for a woman to superior in any game, sport or discussion if she wants to be accepted. 8. Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help. There\u2019s a blog post by Harriet Jacobs that also speaks to this and I urge you to read it in its entirety. In short, it says \u201c\u2026women are raised being told by parents, teachers, media, peers, and all surrounding social strata that : \u00b7 it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed (\u201cmean bitch\u201d) \u00b7 it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional (\u201ccrazy bitch\u201d) \u00b7 it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with, and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others (\u201cstuck-up bitch\u201d) \u00b7 it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody, over and over and over again (\u201cangry bitch\u201d) \u00b7 it is not okay to have (or express) conflicted, fluid, or experimental feelings about yourself, your body, your sexuality, your desires, and your needs (\u201cbitch got daddy issues\u201d) \u00b7 it is not okay to use your physical strength (if you have it) to set physical boundaries (\u201cdyke bitch\u201d) \u00b7 it is not okay to raise your voice (\u201cshrill bitch\u201d) \u00b7 it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you (\u201cmean dyke/frigid bitch\u201d) Now how do these two examples relate to FSoG? Simply put, Ana, the main character in this series, continuously exhibits the behaviors listed in the rules and seems to have the mentality of those listed in the bullets. She might as well be the case study on which both were based. Early in the book there\u2019s an interaction between her and a young man named Paul, the son of the couple she works for. This is someone she says has \u201calways been a buddy\u201d . Just after they greet each other with a hug, \u201che releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder. I shuffle from foot to foot, embarrassed. It\u2019s good to see Paul, but he\u2019s always been overly familiar\u201d Does she tell him that she\u2019s uncomfortable or step out from beneath his arm? No, that\u2019d be going against everything that rule number three has taught her. Plus, she wouldn\u2019t want to come across as a \u201cmean bitch\u201d now would she? Just after this, Paul asks her out. \u201cWhenever he\u2019s home he asks me on a date, and I always say no. It\u2019s a ritual.\u201d Is it a ritual? Or is it something more than that? Has Ana, like many of us, been conditioned to follow the rules to such a degree that she doesn\u2019t know how to tell him \u201cIt\u2019s not okay to keep asking me out\u201d? Is she so terrified of breaking cultural norms and coming across as a mean-crazy-angry-dyke-shrill-frigid bitch that she\u2019ll put up with his pursuit of her indefinitely? Or does she just not know to put a stop to it because she hasn\u2019t been taught to? When she turns him down, yet again, he goes on to say \u201cAna, one of these days you\u2019ll say yes.\u201d Creeped out yet? You should be. How does Ana respond to this declaration? By escaping the room they\u2019re in and getting back to a crowded store floor. What does this tell us? She felt the need to flee. She felt the need to not be alone with him. Part of her clearly recognized the danger of the situation and the repeated advances of her \u201cfriend\u201d. But instead of speaking up, she fled. She never voices her discomfort. She is the submissive, quiet person that society has taught her to be. And 70 million people have read about her and have had these dangerously passive behaviors reinforced, yet again, through her actions, behaviors and words (or lack thereof). How will this same mentality play out in a situation involving sexual assault? I can tell you, because just a few chapters later, she\u2019s sexually assaulted, by another of her \u201cfriends\u201d. \u201cJos\u00e9, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d I try to push him away rather feebly. \u201cAna, please,\u201d he whispers, and now he\u2019s holding me in his arms, pulling me close. \u201cJos\u00e9, what are you doing?\u201d \u201cYou know I like you Ana, please.\u201d He has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him, the other at my chin tipping back my head. Holy fuck\u2026he\u2019s going to kiss me. \u201cNo, Jos\u00e9, stop \u2013 no.\u201d I push him, but he\u2019s a wall of hard muscle, and I cannot shift him. His hand has slipped into my hair, and he\u2019s holding my head in place. \u201cPlease, Ana, cari\u0144o,\u201d he whispers against my lips\u2026 He gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth. I feel panicky, drunk, and out of control. The feeling is suffocating. \u201cJos\u00e9, no,\u201d I plead. I don\u2019t want this. Luckily, Ana is spared further abuse because the one and only Christian Grey arrives on the scene and saves her. How? By saying \u201cI think the lady said no.\u201d That\u2019s right. Ana can try to push Jos\u00e9 away and tell him \u2018no\u2019 multiple times but that\u2019s not good enough. One sentence from a man and Jos\u00e9 immediately releases her, bringing us back to rule number four: When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men. You got that, ladies? Don\u2019t try to fight back because you\u2019ll just be ignored, rely instead on a man. Sort of a catch 22 when the one who\u2019s going to get you into trouble will likely also be a man. Bear in mind that this little scene takes place in the parking lot outside of a crowded bar, just a shout away from salvation. You\u2019re probably wondering why Ana didn\u2019t scream. Why she didn\u2019t fight harder. Well, I\u2019d like to bring up Harriet Jacob\u2019s blog post again because just after her \u201cbitch list\u201d she says this: \u201cIf we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave, we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways. And we should not be surprised when they behave these ways during attempted or completed rapes. Women who are taught not to speak up too loudly or too forcefully or too adamantly or too demandingly are not going to shout \u201cNO\u201d at the top of their goddamn lungs just because some guy is getting uncomfortably close. Women who are taught not to keep arguing are not going to keep saying \u201cNO.\u201d Women who are taught that their needs and desires are not to be trusted, are fickle and wrong and are not to be interpreted by the woman herself, are not going to know how to argue with \u201cbut you liked kissing, I just thought\u2026\u201d Women who are taught that physical confrontations make them look crazy will not start hitting, kicking, and screaming until it\u2019s too late, if they do at all\u2026 Nobody obtains the superpower to behave dramatically differently during a frightening confrontation. Women will behave the same way they have been taught to behave in all social, professional, and sexual interactions.\u201d Eerie, isn\u2019t it? I sure thought so. Hopefully by now you\u2019re beginning to understand the inflammatory statement this all started with. Not only do Ana\u2019s actions and behaviors throughout the book reinforce the horrible societal conditioning that I mentioned earlier but this series also contains a lot of the other facets of rape culture, like victim silencing. For instance, once she\u2019s collected herself, this happens: \u201cTurning, I glance at Jos\u00e9, who looks pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by Grey. I glare at him. I have a few choice words for my so-called friend, none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey, CEO. Ana, who are you kidding? He\u2019s just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora. There\u2019s no disguising you lack of ladylike behavior.\u201d That\u2019s right folks. It isn\u2019t ladylike to yell (shrill bitch). It isn\u2019t ladylike to swear (crazy bitch). It isn\u2019t ladylike to defend yourself after you\u2019ve just been sexually assaulted (mean bitch). Leave that to the menfolk. Surely they\u2019ll defend you. Surely they\u2019ll be the ones to address the fact that you were just sexually assaulted. Men, you know, the other sex, the ones that have been raised to talk about emotions. In public. And while we\u2019re discussing this scene we can\u2019t forget about rule number eight: Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help. That\u2019s what Christian is to her at this point in the book. A stranger. She\u2019s seen him only three times, in formal or work-related settings, and knows nothing about him other than he\u2019s rich, good looking and that his shopping list resembles those of serial killers (I\u2019ll get to that last part later in the review). But accept his help and trust his kindness she does. She lets this complete stranger remove her from the bar, assuming that as he\u2019s just saved her from a sexual assault, he's not planning one of his own. When she wakes up in his suite the next morning, pantsless by the way, she accuses Christian of stalking her. He defends himself by saying: \u201c\u2026if I hadn\u2019t come to get you, you\u2019d probably waking up in the photographer\u2019s (Jos\u00e9\u2019s) bed, and from what I can remember, you weren\u2019t overly enthused about him pressing his suit,\u201d he (Christian) says acidly. Pressing his suit! I glance up at Christian. He\u2019s glaring at me, eyes blazing, aggrieved. I try to bit my lip, but I fail to repress my giggle. \u201cWhich Medieval chronicle did you escape from? You sound like a courtly knight.\u201d You got that? Stalking\u2019s okay. Because it\u2019s better than being raped. *facepalm* I\u2019m almost at a loss at how to address the rest of this without copious amounts of swearing. How little she\u2019s concerned with her \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d behavior is appalling. That there\u2019s no thought on her end about Christian\u2019s allusion to her rape escape is appalling. How she glosses over it all and makes a fucking joke about it is appalling. It continues by the way. \u201cI would have been fine. I was with Kate.\u201d \u201cAnd the photographer?\u201d he (Christian) snaps at me. \u201cJos\u00e9 just got out of line.\u201d I shrug. A shrug is a dismissive gesture, just in case you were wondering. She dismisses sexual assault as \u2018getting out of line\u2019. She downplays the severity of what happened. Why does she do this? Because it\u2019s awkward to talk about it? Because it\u2019s scary to think that someone she knows and trusts assaulted her and that when she tried to push him away and said \u2018no\u2019 he ignored her? Guess what? It\u2019s always going to suck to talk about. It\u2019s always scary to realize that statistics say that if you\u2019re raped, you\u2019ll know your attacker. But we need to talk about these things because if we don\u2019t, nothing will ever change. And now the grand finale, victim shaming and blaming. You see, Jos\u00e9 feels bad for what he did. At first, Ana is pissed at him, as she should be, and even after he calls her numerous times and leaves several messages, she continues to ignore him, deciding to \u201clet him stew\u201d. Then the NEXT DAY, this happens: \"The memory of Jos\u00e9\u2019s attempted kiss haunts me. I\u2019m beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back.\" She feels cruel? She feels cruel for not returning the calls of the man that forced himself upon her? Well, of course she does. She's been trained to be gracious and polite. He's addressing her. Rule number one has taught her that she should smile in this situation so it would make sense that she feels bad for not doing so. Two days later, they talk: \u201cCan I see you? I\u2019m sorry about Friday night. I was drunk\u2026and you\u2026well. Ana \u2013 please forgive me.\u201d \u201cOf course, I forgive you Jos\u00e9. Just don\u2019t do it again. You know I don\u2019t feel like that about you.\u201d Here\u2019s where I start to get really angry. \u201c..and you\u2026\u201d what exactly? Were there? Were breathing? Had tits? How can Jos\u00e9\u2019s behavior in any way be blamed on Ana? This is the \u201cshe deserved to be raped because she was wearing a skirt\u201d mentality that needs to be burned from our collective minds. No one can ever make you do anything. Everything you do, every way you behave is a choice that you and you alone make. So no, there is no \u201c\u2026and you\u2026\u201d . Books like this, with scenes like the ones I\u2019ve spoken about only perpetuate our silence, our ignorance, our discomfort, and our complicity. They reinforce unhealthy behaviors and thinking patterns and they perpetuate rape culture. Authors, I beg you, don\u2019t cover tough issues and strong themes if you can\u2019t do them justice. Grant them the depth and the severity they deserve. Please. ...more You know, I was beginning to wonder if I needed to change some of my two star books to one star.

Thank you E.L. James, for proving to me there was something worth waiting for. Something that truly exemplifies the meaning of terrible. Now hold up, all you would-be defenders. I read this whole thing. I did not skip anything, I did not skim, I read every word. I bought this book with the intention of giving it the benefit of the doubt. You see, I love erotica, and I'm not ashamed to say that I both read (as you see on my 2012 books I've already read two others) and write it myself. So I was thinking to myself, oh, maybe there's a possibility that even though this is a twi-fiction rewrite, and even though everyone makes fun of it, it could still be a fun little guilty-pleasure read that I can laugh along with. NO. NO. NO. NO. This book is NOT: - erotic/sexy - funny, even ironically - endearing - full of sexual taboos This book IS: - repetitive - plotless (well, you knew that) - painful to get through - depicting manipulative, controlling, and self-destructive as desirable - how to not write a novel - how to gain success by using other people's characters, barely changing them and then laughing all the way to the bank Most people know about the twilight matchups so I'm not going to go into too much detail, but it was actually quite sickening, how lazy she was to change ANY story details: Bella Anastasia, a clumsy girl who grew up in Arizona Las Vegas with her mother, then moved to Forks Vancouver, Washington where her dad stepdad lives, while her mother lives with her new husband in Florida Georgia. She has a younger friend named Jacob Jose with a crush on her, and whose dad is friends with her dad, because they are fishing partners and police force army buddies, and who gave her his old truck VW beetle. Edward Christian, who is adopted and has a sibling named Emmett Elliott and a sister named Alice Mia, also adopted, who live with their parents Carlisle Carrick (really? CARRICK? We couldn't even change the first three letters?) and Esme Grace. Their father mother is a doctor. Rose Kate and Jasper Ethan are also siblings in this story, but have been changed to be friends of Anastasia, since in Twilight they already have a convenient different last name than the other Cullens. Also, he 'dazzles' her. I can't even function over the fact that upon preparing this book for publishing she couldn't change one fucking thing to make it even remotely different. That was too hard. TOO DAMN HARD. The similarities in character are so untouched that I am sincerely appalled that she thought it 'different' enough to publish as is. It's quite disgusting. Alright, continuing on, and once again, I'm sure you've heard this already: this book is terribly written. Most notably the lack of ability to describe anything other than the few choice phrases she knows how to type. He ran his hands through his hair. I bit my lip. He told me not to bite my lip. Oh jeez. He grabbed me by the chin to make me look up at him. Holy crap. I peeked up at him. Lather rinse repeat. Over. And over. And over. For 500 pages. Then there's the case of multiple personality disorder, where she hears the voices of two distinct other pieces of herself in her head. The subconscious, the one telling her she's not good enough, and the inner goddess, the one that's all into the sex. It's strange because I'm also currently reading a book right now, Deadline, where the main character hears a voice in his head because he is literally insane, and it's written almost the exact same way, he talks back to his voice, who presents herself in italics, just as Anastasia talks back to her two italics voices. It's funny because she's supposed to be completely normal, and yet shares the same schizophrenic tendencies as a book about someone who is completely insane. This is sense. Check out this awesome short paragraph from chapter 24: \u201cThrough the haze of light, I squint and see Christian leaning over me, smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.\u201d What are these fragments, four in a row. What is this punctuation. GASP AT HIM BEING CLOTHED. Is this supposed to be poetry? Let me add some line breaks for poetic interest: Through the haze of light, I squint and see , Christian leaning over me, Smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black. That's almost better. Let's have another, shall we, from chapter 24 once more: \u201cI didn't put that song on my iPod,\u201d he says casually, and puts his foot down so that I am thrown back into my seat as the car accelerates along the freeway. What? He knows what he's doing, the bastard. Who did? And I have to listen to Britney going on and on. Who...who? The song ends and the iPod shuffles to Damien Rice being morunful. Who? Who? I stare out the window, my stomach churning. Who? SAY WHO AGAIN, BITCH. JUST TRY IT, I DARE YOU. Okay and now, maybe even worse than the writing (oh hell, nothing's worse than the writing, nevermind) is the lack of plot. Now once again, you already know this. Do I even need to tell you nothing happens? Seeing as it's based off of a book where nothing happens, you can be guaranteed that as we go one step removed, even less happens. Here is the part where I apologize to Twilight, where I said, in my page by page commentary below, that 50 Shades was more entertaining. I was at the very beginning. I was young and na\u00efve. I didn't realize. I'm sorry. You know how The Office kind of got bad after Jim and Pam got together, because there was really nothing you were waiting for after that? This happens by like...chapter 2. You're like...okay....what, now we jut have to watch them whine as a couple for the next zillion pages? Okay. I can't even fathom that there are two other books written about this couple. I literally want to open the window and invite birds to eat my eyes out as punishment for buying and reading this book. And now for a bit of tiddlybits, I'm going to share some information on storywriting that you guys might find interesting, and will help show exactly why 50 Shades has zero plot. I went to school for film, and we had story development classes. One thing we were beaten over the head with about is something called the 7 Sentence Story. This will help for any writers that are writing their books to be cinematic or would like their novel to be considered for film purposes (this is by no means a rule, but a really helpful guideline). First, you need a problem, a conflict. A reason to tell a story. Once you have that, your plot should be able to be described in seven sentences thusly: Exposition: we are introduced to the protagonist and/or main characters Inciting Incident: something happens that kicks off the conflict, the whole point of the story Plot Point 1: because of the inciting incident, character sets off to do something/correct the problem, etc Midpoint: here in film you might see a montage, but it's a place where either plot point 1 is resolved or there is a transition in the characters way of thinking Plot Point 2: often an even bigger issue arises, or a twist that changes or accelerates the conflict Climax: final showdown or decisions needed to be made Resolution.: everything comes to an end, the conflict is settled in one way or another Basically, if you can tell your story in this way in seven sentences, you'll know that A) the main point is clear, B) that your story doesn't wander too much in different directions, and C) that you actually have a plot to stand on, that you can justify there's enough substance there. And since that's a lot of vagueness, we'll go with a classic captive/dominant story to show how one tells a story in seven sentences: Disney's Beauty and the Beast. First, the main conflict: Conflict: The prince has been turned into a beast and has only a limited time left before he is trapped forever as one. And the seven sentence story: Exposition: Belle is a smart girl who rejects the advances of Gaston, as she doesn't want to be stuck in a mundane life. Inciting Incident: Belle's father gets lost and captured by the Beast in his castle. Plot Point 1: Belle trades her freedom for her father and is prisoner in the castle. Midpoint: Belle starts to experience feelings for the Beast and is complacent. Plot Point 2: Belle's father is sick, and the Beast decides to let her go, even though he's giving up his chances of being with her. Climax: Gaston comes with an angry mob to destroy the Beast. Resolution: While Beast lays dying, his love for Belle turns him back into a human and he can live with her happily ever after. Simple, right? Of course, other things happen, but no doubt you can communicate the main story with just these sentences. Okay, so let's try 50 Shades, which, hilariously, has had its film rights bought already. Conflict: Anastasia must decide whether to be with a guy who she thinks is super hot but also scares her (This fascinating decision, I tell you what.) Exposition: Anastasia is a literary student at WSU. Inciting Incident: Anastasia meets Christian on page 7, and thinks he's hot and mysterious and also frustrating. It is clear they both have chemistry. Plot Point 1, which is sloppy and all over the place: Christian chases her down, brings her to his house and shows her he's into S&M. Also they have sex. Sorta Midpoint, but kind of squished close to Plot Point 1: Anastasia must decide whether to pledge herself to him via contract if she wants to continue seeing him. Plot Point 2: Nah, she's still deciding and whining about how he's kind of scary but continues to have sex with him throughout this whole time. There is no plot point 2. Climax: Well there isn't really one, it's just kind of an all over the place ending...either the more complicated sex scene at the end with the hymnal music or him hitting with her with the belt the next morning, one of the two I guess... Resolution: She says he's too weird and ends it. What a complex, thrilling, and incredible plot full of depth. SHOULD I HAVE CUT THAT FOR SPOILERS? OOPS? Did you even care? If you've gotten this far, nope. But guess what. We know that there are two other books and they get together and lesson isn't really learned so AWESOME, COOL. I guess that's how she gets people to buy the next ones because hot diggedy I can't wait to see them get back together and whine some more. And let's talk about the sex for a moment. Nothing forbidden actually happens that you'll be like ohhhh how scandalous I want to try that. For the most part it's pretty much all basic stuff or basic toy play, because basically he's taking it easier on her since she's inexperienced. Except for the belt part at the end, I guess, which just doesn't sound fun. And you already heard about the tampon, so like, that's not even a surprise (although imo it's not a big deal anyway. Out of all the women having sex on their periods regularly, I can guarantee you there are quite a few men that are tasked with taking the tampon out and throwing it aside.) I was actually more upset about the fact that she is sleeping completely naked in a hotel room bed on day two of her period. As if that isn't going to be a mess in the morning. Okay lest I go on as long as the book, you get the point. If you want to see more, my commentary while reading it is below. However, a few things: -I cannot stand how much the author being middle aged shows from the point of view of this 21 year old. \u201cI'm gonna buy plane tickets...on the Internet.\u201d ARE YOU NOW? WHOAOOOAOAOA. Don't get crazy on us, I might be too overwhelmed by this turn of events. \u201cI fired up my email.\u201d BLAZING SPEEDS REQUIRED. -They actually do the \u201cyou hang up\u201d \u201cno you hang up\u201d \u201cno you \u201d that gross couples tend to do. And it was, expectedly, gross. -Someone on ONTD who liked this book yelled at me because I said that Christian is not a dominant (they also said I wasn't 'experienced enough to understand,' lol okay, like you know who I am, anon.) I still stand by that statement. It's not what he's doing, it's how he's doing it. He is deeply troubled, whiny, and manipulative, and while he does love control, it's for the wrong reasons. He was abused as a child, and sexually abused as a 15 year old and vastly denies it, and because of this he justifies his activities as personal preference when he is in fact a bit too fucked up to currently have a relationship. He ends up making the na\u00efve Anastasia batshit crazy because he continues to string her along, trying to convince her they want the same things, instead of getting himself some help. -He gives her the illusion that she has the choice to back out, but then turns around and says ha-ha I'm joking but I know where to find you by the way. She goes to visit her mother because she needs a break from him to think, and what does he do? Flies out there, using his roundabout stalker way of finding information about where she's at, like he always does, to meet up, have sex with her and take her out with him. She's supposed to be visiting her mother and having time to think, yet he can't stay away and makes this about HIM, taking her away from time with her mom whom she hasn't seen in 6 months. I can't at this selfish fucking bastard because he just can't stay away. It makes me mad just thinking about someone that clingy. Which is another thing that pisses me off, almost everything about their whining and relationship conversations reminds me of everything I've hated about past relationships I've had. How does ANYONE enjoy this book? How does anyone think that this is sexy, that this depicts something they want? I can't even. I cannot. (Also I should never have imagined Chuck and Blair from Gossip Girl as the main characters. Now everytime I see a commercial for Gossip Girl, rage courses through my body.) I'm bored. Someone get me out of here. P.S. Did you know that James recently stated she's set the bar for writing pretty high? Cool. Please, do yourself a favor and go buy a book of much higher quality plot and writing, ohhhh like....Modelland. ...more WARNING: This review will probably involve me swearing profusely, and quoting/discussing sex scenes that children should not be reading.

UPDATE: And another quick note before you read this, since I seem to be getting a lot of similar comments. Let me spell this out for you: BDSM DOES NOT OFFEND ME. If a couple decides to engage in BDSM, that's totally fine. I don't care. It's none of my business, and everyone is entitled to their personal choices. However, I think couples need to come to a proper agreement about these things. They need to have a serious discussion before getting into this stuff, and they should both know about what they're getting into and consensually agree to what they're doing and what the boundaries are. While I have nothing against BDSM, I have a lot of issues with how it was portrayed in this book. I didn't feel that Christian and Ana ever had a good, understanding discussion about the boundaries they were setting. It seemed more that Christian was forcing Ana into something she knew nothing about, and it obviously scared her at times in the book. So, that does NOT scream \"healthy relationship\" to me. So really, stop telling me that I hated this book because I \"don't understand BDSM.\" I do ... and I don't think it was portrayed in a healthy manner in this story. On top of that, even if BDSM did offend me, I hated everything about the book anyway\u2013\u2013the plot (or lack thereof), the characters, the writing ... I thought it was all horrible. So yeah. ANOTHER QUICK UPDATE: Laci Green does an excellent job explaining why BDSM is portrayed poorly in this book. ON TO THE ACTUAL REVIEW: Well... This book was unbelievably horrible. I mean, really . I hated this book more than I hate House of Night. Possibly even more than I hate Halo . At least those books attempted to have a plot. Fifty Shades of What the Fuck Grey didn't even do that. Okay, let's back up a little. I started hearing about this book probably a month or two ago. I kept seeing it all over Goodreads, and Twitter, and Amazon, and all that jazz. So I was like, \"Wow, this book is super popular. Wonder if it's any good!\" I look up the plot here on Goodreads, and I'm like, \"Uhh ... This sounds like ... porn.\" And soon I was hearing about how ridiculous it is, and yada yada. Yet, I was still tempted to read it, because I kind of wanted to see what the hype was about. And some of my friends were like, \"Ooh we should all read it and see how dumb it is!\" ... And you know me, I always like snarking about stupid books. But it turns out, this is hardly even a book. A bit of backround research will quickly inform you that this book is actually a very long piece of Twilight fanfiction . I kid you not. The author originally posted it on Fanfiction, using Bella Swan and Edward Cullen as the two main characters' names. Because it was apparently too sexy, she then took it off Fanfiction and posted it on her own website, swapping Edward and Bella's names with Christian Grey and <---C>Anastasia Steele</---C>. ( Update: If you think I'm exaggerating, just read this . The original piece of fanfiction and Fifty Shades of Grey are 89% the same text .) So, this book is literally a weird, porno version of Twilight \u2013\u2013only with the characters' names changed, and the author replaced the vampires with ... sex. If that doesn't send you running, I don't know what will. But really, this book even fails as fanfiction. There were parts where E.L. James pretty much just copied scenes word-for-word out of Twilight and swapped the names. Take the two scenes below\u2013\u2013one of them from Twilight and one of them from Fifty Shades of Grey\u2013\u2013for example. In both of them, the couple is at a restaurant. A waitress walks up to take their order, and she is dazzled by the handsomeness of the male character. She walks away. And the couple has almost word-for-word the same conversation afterwards. From Twilight : \"Um\u2013\u2013\" She shook her head, blinking. \"Your server will be right out.\" She walked away unsteadily. \"You really shouldn't do that to people,\" I criticized. \"It's hardly fair.\" \"Do what?\" \"Dazzle them like that\u2013\u2013She's probably hyperventilating in the kitchen right now.\" He seemed confused. \"Oh, come on,\" I said dubiously. \"You have to know the effect you have on people.\" He tilted his head to one side, his eyes were curious. \"I dazzle people?\" \"You haven't noticed? Do you think everybody gets their way so easily?\" He ignored my questions. \"Do I dazzle you?\" \"Frequently,\" I admitted. Now, the scene from Fifty Shades of Grey : \u201cThank you sir. Will that be all?\u201d Leandra whispers, looking anywhere but at the two of us. We both turn to stare at her, and she flushes crimson again and scuttles away. \u201cYou know it\u2019s really not fair.\u201d I glance down at the Formica tabletop, tracing a pattern in it with my index finger, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cWhat\u2019s not fair?\u201d \u201cHow you disarm people. Women. Me.\u201d \u201cDo I disarm you?\u201d I snort. \u201cAll the time.\u201d See what I mean? This isn't just fanfiction. It almost verges on outright plagiarism. But anyway, that's just a brief introduction to the book. So, let's look at the other things at which this book utterly fails. The Plot: Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele is a 21-year-old woman who is just finishing college. Her best friend is supposed to interview a wealthy entrepreneur named Christian Grey, but falls ill on the day of the interview. So, she sends Ana in her place. Of course, Christian ends up being a sexy man\u2013\u2013but also an arrogant bastard. Ana is like, \"Wow, what a jerk. But he's so HAWT.\" Naturally, Christian then begins stalking her like a maniac. He shows up at some caf\u00e9 where she's eating, then at her job ... Then, one night, she gets super drunk at a club and calls him. He tracks her cell phone and hunts her down. He then essentially kidnaps her, takes her to a fancy hotel, and takes off her pants (but doesn't have sex with her). Oh, and of course he buys her a bunch of nice new clothing to replace the ones she vomited on. The next day, he takes her on a helicopter ride to his giant mansion. Soon, he says he wants to show her something, and then leads her into a torture chamber. ... You read that correctly. He has a fucking medieval torture chamber in his house. (And the \"fucking\" part is quite literal...) So, you'd expect Ana to be like: Instead she's just like, \"lol How kinky.\" And ... well ... this all happens within the first 80 pages or so. Soon after, Christian finds out that Ana is a virgin and feels the need to amend this \"situation\" as he refers to it. What follows is about 300 pages of sex scenes that escalate in weirdness. Occasionally the two of them go out to eat food, or Ana goes somewhere to visit someone and Christian stalks her ... same old, same old. But most of it is just the bizarre BDSM sex scenes. (And a quick note to trolls: It's not the BDSM that offends me, it's the weird way in which the sex scenes are written.) I guess the only \"conflict\"\u2013\u2013if you could really call that\u2013\u2013lies in Christian's backstory. Apparently he is into this S&M stuff because his virginity was taken away by one of his mother's friends, and then they had some weird affair together ... and ... yeah, I don't really understand how it's related, either so I won't try to explain it. So anyway, if there is any conflict in this book at all, it's Ana's occasional, bizarre jealousy of this Mrs. Robinson character. Towards the end of the book, she and Christian argue about it, and Ana is convinced that the two of them are still a couple and ... it's just stupid and not really worth discussing. So, that is pretty much the whole story. The Characters: Both of the main characters are Mary Sues. Or I suppose Christian is a Gary Stu. Whatever. Anyway, here are just a few Mary Sue traits of both: Ana: - thinks she can't fall in love - has no interests in anything besides British literature - is a klutz but doesn't really have any other realistic flaws - hates herself and sees herself as totally undesirable, yet everyone is in love with her - has never been drunk before - is a virgin, yet is miraculously awesome at sex - is apparently gorgeous and in good shape, even though she repeatedly claims to never work out at all Christian: - \"doesn't do romance\" and has so-called \"commitment issues\" - is richer than God, and so can buy whatever the fuck he wants at the drop of a hat\u2013\u2013like first editions of really old books, laptops that haven't come out yet, fancy cars (all for Ana of course) - plays piano exceptionally well - is allowed to be a bastard because he's attractive But on top of being clich\u00e9d, Mary Sue-ish characters, these two are just bland and terrible people to begin with. There isn't really much to say about Ana. She obviously has no idea what the difference between romance and abuse is. She even admits several times that Christian seems like a stalker, and that he's rather scary ... plus, she has many golden opportunities to run away from Christian. Yet, she sticks with him because \"he's so freaking hot!\" apparently. Seriously, reading her train of thought is just painful. Christian ... is just a sexist, abusive bastard. Did I mention that besides all the creepy sex stuff, he makes Ana sign a fucking contract (which is like ten pages long) basically turning her life over to him. This contract allows him to choose what she eats and wears, how much she exercises, and how often she shaves/waxes. He also forces her to take contraception, and he forbids her from masturbating because he \"wants all her pleasure.\" ... No. Just freaking NO. Dang, this guy makes Edward Cullen look like the best boyfriend ever. I don't think I've ever come across a main male protagonist who was so controlling, sexist, demanding, and disgusting ... and then is portrayed as being \"sexy.\" NO. NO, THAT IS NOT SEXY. THAT IS PLAIN, CLEAR ABUSE. (EDIT: Okay, trolls. So no, Ana does not actually sign this contract. I misspoke (or mis-wrote, whatever). However, the point is that Christian wants her to sign this contract which does actually say all of those things. And even though Ana does not sign it, Christian still does whatever he wants with her, so to me I don't find it very important whether she signed the contract or not. The point is, Christian actually wrote this ridiculous document spelling out everything he wants a woman to do for him, and tries to pressure Ana into signing it\u2013\u2013and yes, I think that is abusive. Moving on.) The writing: Where to start? This book is just written like the stream-of-consciousness of a 15-year-old. All Ana can seem to do in her narration is comment on how sexy Christian looks, and throw in a lot of \"Holy shit!\"/\"Holy crap!\"/\"Holy fuck!\"s. I read this in ebook format, so I looked up how many times each of these phrases was used. \"holy shit\" = 65 times \"holy crap\" = 54 times \"holy fuck\" = 45 times Anyway ... just some little gems to give you a taste of what the writing is like: \"My scalp prickles at the idea that maybe, just maybe, he might like me. After all, he did say he was glad Kate didn\u2019t do the interview. I hug myself with quiet glee, rocking from side to side, entertaining the possibility that he might like me for one brief moment.\" \"She blinks at me with surprise \u2013 I very rarely throw my toys out of the pram\" --> Some weird British saying? OOH HERE'S MY FAVORITE: \"Travis is Jos\u00e9\u2019s friend and gopher\" --> BAHAHAHAHAHA OH GOD. I think the word you meant was \"go-fer.\" This, E.L. James, is a GOPHER: Anyway, moving on ... \"My mouth goes dry looking at him... he\u2019s so freaking hot.\" \"Oh my... he really is, quite... wow. As I touch his hand, I\u2019m aware of that delicious current running right through me, lighting me up, making me blush, and I\u2019m sure my erratic breathing must be audible.\" \"Grey smiles a dazzling, unguarded, natural, all-teeth-showing, glorious smile.\" --> Would you like some sentence with those adjectives? \"My mouth pops open as I gasp and swallow at the same time.\" --> Pretty sure that's impossible\u2026 \"Two orgasms... coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.\" --> Uhhh ... WHAT. \"He\u2019s my very own Christian Grey flavor popsicle.\" --> Yes, this means what you think it does. \"His fingers circle my ear, and very softly, he tugs my earlobe, rhythmically. It\u2019s so sexual.\" \"I blush scarlet.\" --> Okay, she uses this phrase like five hundred times. What other color would she blush?! Green? Purple? \"body-shattering orgasm\" --> lolwut \"Now please do not refer to yourself as \u2018some woman I fuck occasionally\u2019 because, quite frankly it makes me MAD, and you really wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry.\" --> Isn't that something the Hulk says? Well besides the \"woman I fuck occasionally\" part\u2026 And THEN there was this really odd description E.L. James kept using where Ana kept referring to her \"inner goddess\" ... whatever the hell that means. Somewhere in the story, \"inner goddess\" was swapped with \"subconscious\" ... but in both cases, Ana keeps talking about this imaginary person living inside her and it's just ... well, see for yourself: \"and my very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba\" \"My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatiently.\" \"My subconscious scowls at me... fucking \u2013 not lovemaking \u2013 she screams at me like a harpy. I ignore her, but deep down I know she has a point.\" \"My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.\" \"My inner goddess is jumping up and down, clapping her hands like a five-year-old.\" \"My inner goddess glows so bright she could light up Portland.\" \"My inner goddess is not pleased.\" \"You look kinda dorky... my subconscious is at her snarky best. So are you going to introduce Ray to the man you\u2019re fucking? She is glaring at me over her wing-shaped spectacles. He\u2019d be so proud. God, I hate her sometimes.\" \"'Ho\u2019 my subconscious mouths at me.\" \"I flush, and my inner goddess smacks her lips together glowing with pride.\" \"My inner goddess is panting.\" \"My inner goddess is going to explode.\" \"My inner goddess has woken and is paying attention.\" \"My inner goddess has her pom poms in hand - she\u2019s in cheerleading mode.\" \"My subconscious chides me, but I don\u2019t want to listen to her \u2013 I almost hug myself with glee because I know this will drive him crazy.\" \"My subconscious is furious, medusa-like in her anger, hair flying, her hands clenched around her face like Edvard Munch\u2019s Scream.\" \"My subconscious stares at me with an ugly twist to her mouth\" \"My subconscious rears her ugly head, leering, and I\u2019m shocked and nauseous at the thought.\" \"My inner goddess pole-vaults over the fifteen-foot bar.\" \"My subconscious has her snarky face on.\" \"My subconscious has passed out, and my inner goddess is endeavoring to look brave.\" \"Deep down, a nasty, unbidden thought comes from my inner goddess, her lip curled in a snarl...\" (Note: The phrase \"inner goddess\" is used in this book 47 TIMES.) Oh, and here are just a few really WHAT THE FUCK moments: \"I eye Christian\u2019s toothbrush. It would be like having him in my mouth. Hmm... Glancing guiltily over my shoulder at the door, I feel the bristles on the toothbrush. They are damp. He must have used it already. Grabbing it quickly, I squirt toothpaste on it and brush my teeth in double quick time. I feel so naughty. It\u2019s such a thrill.\" \"Not taking his eyes off mine, he scrunches my panties in his hand, holds them up to his nose, and inhales deeply.\" \"He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string... what! And... a gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet.\" ... ... ... Okay, I think we've all had enough, now. I really don't have anything else to say about this book. It was dreadful\u2013\u2013badly written, sexist, boring, predictable, disgusting, and just ... horrible. Let's just say, Christian Grey would spank me about five thousand times for how many times I rolled my eyes while reading this. ---------- Read more of my reviews at Flying Kick-a-pow!

She \"flushes\" constantly, and on several occasions referred to her hoo-hoo-naughty place as \"down there .\" Next, we have Christian Grey: Christian is a misogynistic, self-loathing, abusive piece of shit. Apparently, his only redeeming qualities are, in this order; his ridiculous good looks, his money, and his giant penis. The only time Ana seems to like him as a person is when he's being \"lovable\", and those times are few and far between. Most of the time he's serious, brooding, and threatening. How charming. I knew from the very first line this wasn't going to be good. \"I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror.\" It was cemented that early, my deep, deep dislike for this moronic, simpering asshole. Your hair won't behave? Guess what? My suspicions were confirmed a few pages later when Ana admits that any \"sympathy\" she feels for her sick friend is \"unwelcome\". Unwelcome, apparently because her friend is beautiful, even when she has the flu...? What a petty, jealous cunt. The only thing that made the first 4% of this book tolerable was the fact that I read it aloud to my younger brother, and his frequent commentary was amusingly distracting. Once he gave up, however, I had to travel the rest of the road alone. What a painful journey it was. My first impressions of Ana were bad (deservedly so). What were my first impressions of Christian? Well... That's how I felt about Christian Grey. From the beginning. Any time an author tries to sell me on a character's \"charm\" by waxing hormonal about how \"ridiculously good-looking\" he is, I snicker inwardly. I can't think why.... Huh. Anyway, after reading about the description of Christian's building (hello, first penis metaphor), I had to sit through the awful dialogue between these smarmy idiots and hope beyond hope that something, anything, would distract me enough to see me through to the end. Turns out, I found something about 15% through. I went back and counted, and kept track throughout the rest of the book, and do you have any idea how many fucking times Ana said \"Oh my\" in this monumentally bad missive? Do you? I'll tell you; 79! 79 motherfucking times. \"He pulled me back against his chest... oh my .\" \"He began kissing a trail down my belly, oh my .\" \"He's an insufferable douchenozzle, oh my !\" (I'm just thankful that neither lions, tigers, nor bears were brought into this mess at any point.) About halfway through, I wished I'd been keeping track of the word \"crap\" because Ana is constantly saying/thinking it. Crap, Holy Crap, Double and Triple Crap, Oh Crap, This Crap, That Crap, any and all Crap. Speaking of crap, if I ever, ever ever have to hear/read the words \"inner goddess\" again, I'm going to construct a pyre out of tampons and maxi pads, light it, and toss unsuspecting women into it. ^My inner goddess will cap yours in the face if you don't shut the fuck up^ I'm sorry, I just couldn't take any of this seriously. His playroom. His playroom ? Really? Or how about his weird-ass issues with food? He wants the girl slim and in shape, yet he won't stop trying to force her to eat! I simply love the attempt E.L. James made at giving these pathetic shells personalities. Ana wears Converse, drives a vintage car, and likes classic British lit. *Yawn* haven't heard any of that before. And Christian; we know Christian's super deep and sophisticated because he plays the piano and listens to obscure classical music. This is how we know Edward Christian is really just a lost soul in need of love; his love of music. Everyone knows that no one threatening listens to music. Music lovers just aren't capable of doing anything bad. ^ Surprise! Psychos like music, too.^ Since this is considered nothing more than \"mommy porn\", I will attempt to pander to that particular demographic for a moment. Were the sex scenes well-written? Well, none of it was particularly well-written. The sex scenes could be kind of...honestly, they were kind of boring. I've had more exciting sex myself, so I guess reader response to the sex scenes is dependent on reader experience. There's nothing revolutionary here, and a lot of it is just plain unrealistic. I mean, come on, he pretty much jackhammers her hymen and she walks away with nothing more than a passing, pleasant soreness? Riiiight. How about the time he gives her a handjob with a soapy washcloth? Hello? Apparently neither one of them has ever heard of a urinary tract infection. Oh, or we could talk about her first time giving Christian a blowjob, during which Ana established herself as some kind of Queen of Deepthroat. Anyone wanna hear about the tampon scene? Oh, you've already heard about the tampon scene? Yeah, same here, although hearing about it and reading the actual scene are a bit different. For some reason, you imagine it being worse than it actually is, while at the same time, reading about it is more horrifying than you could possibly imagine. \"He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string... what! And...gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet.\" Look, I'm not against sex during menses, but a guy plucking out a girl's tampon? Yeah, gross. I'm not a prude, but there are certain lines people just shouldn't cross. What makes it worse is that Christian is just thrilled that Ana's raggin' because he hates using condoms. Apparently, Mr. GinormoDick doesn't know that a woman can get pregnant while on her period. Which is hilarious considering all the teaching and training he's doing to remedy Ana's sexual ignorance. Sexual dependence, thy name is Anastasia Steele. We're supposed to believe that this girl has gone 21 years neither having had sex nor masturbating? Hm. Well, Christian's supposed sexual prowess makes a bit more sense now, as does Ana's assertion that he has a giant bologna wand. She has absolutely zero experience, and she's never once had anything \"in there \". Thing could be the size of a baby carrot and she'd still be like, \"Oh, my glob! How is it ever going to fit?!\" It's good that she stockpiled all those potential orgasms, though, because now she's capable of having like, 15 a day or something. It's ridiculous. Come to think of it, Christian's obsession with her eating habits makes a bit more sense now. She was probably beginning to look like something out of a horror movie. Seriously, though, are we going to take the word of a girl who is apparently so undersexed she's never even masturbated? I guess I can sort of understand this obsession with some kind of an awakening, but...really? \"Oh, he's soooo good in bed!\" How the hell would she know?! She has absolutely nothing with which to compare, not even her own damn hand! Now I'll be totally honest, the biggest issue I have with Fifty Shades of Shit is neither the sex nor the horrible writing. It's the plot. Thin as it is, it's still there, its core message being that, given enough time, you can change someone. While I don't have any problem with this if all you're trying to do is help them to lose weight or quit smoking, when you're talking about an emotionally and (dangerously close to) physically abusive relationship, sending that kind of message is ridiculous and irresponsible. Christian is controlling, possessive, condescending, and cruel. He doesn't allow Ana to behave as she normally would, and Ana just puts up with it, insistent that if she can give him what he wants, when he wants, as often as he wants, she can eventually begin to pull his strings. Will it work? In the books, probably. In real life? No. Almost never. How many misguided women are going to waste their lives on some emotionally retarded prick because they've read shit like this and think this kind of fucked-up fairytale will come true for them? I've known women with this mentality. \"Oh, he's so dark and dangerous and threatening, but he's got a sad, lonely side, and if I could just figure out what's wrong, I could change him!\" Wake the fuck up! He may be hot, he may have a huge dick, he may even be rich, that doesn't make him a good person. It doesn't even make him a potentially good person. Quit.Being.A.Fucking.Idiot. (Look, I can make my words Staccato like Christian. Now hold still while I choke you until you pass out...) ^Ana and Christian^ - \"I said don't roll your eyes at me!!\" Christian stalks Ana (which she turns into a fucking joke), and whispers things to her \"threateningly\". She's constantly afraid he's going to beat the crap out of her, and with good reason as he, on more than one occasion, tells her he's going to/wants to. Potential rape is downplayed. Ana's friend, Jake Jose, starts pushing himself on her rather vehemently when they're both drunk. Ana repeatedly says no, but Jose just keeps trying to go in for the kill. Admiral Chaps busts on up with his riding crop, however, and saves her. Ana (understandably) avoids Jose for a while after that, and when her other friend asks her why, all Ana says is, \"He made a pass at me.\" Later on, she and Jose are friends again, the \"attempted kiss\" forgotten. *Sigh* Rapists appear to be a theme. Christian tells Ana that he gets off on having complete and total control over another person. This is not just in the bedroom, but in Ana's overall life. On several occasions, he fails to yield when Ana says no, plunging on regardless, assured she'll like whatever he does, anyway, so why bother stopping? And there are women out there who think this is romantic. I wish you the best of luck, ladies. Just keep in mind that while you're fantasizing about abusive, misogynistic assholes like Grey, there are a lot of women dealing with the horrors of actually living with men like him. For all you ladies bustin' out your toys while daydreaming about Hunky Mr. Grey, I want you to do something for me. It'll only take a moment. Close your eyes. Think about all the things Christian Grey does in the book. Not just those supposed sweet things, but really, everything. His condescension, his control, his insane jealousy, his threats.....and now....imagine he looks like this: Still turned on? The end of the book was absolutely hilarious, with Ana fleeing in emotional tumult because Christian can't give her what she needs ( love! *sniff*). And we're treated to her alternately being angry about the pain and humiliation she faced at Christian's hands, and chastising herself for being a failure and for being mean to Christian. It really is classic abuse mentality. Yet I see her being touted by some as \"strong and independent\". It's this kind of ignorant trash that sets feminism back decades. Women who defend this book are, however unwittingly, participating in some of the most blatant misogyny I've ever witnessed, giving the impression that some women enjoy being debased, abused, and controlled ( outside of a consensual Dom/sub relationship). This is not a book about BDSM, this is a book about one sick, abusive man and his obsession with a young, naive invertebrate. It's a book about a girl who has absolutely no sense of self, who sacrifices any pretense of individuality in order to hold onto a man who doesn't even show her the faintest glimmer of respect. It's about two attention-starved individuals with the emotional maturity of toilet paper convincing themselves that their relationship is 'like, the best thing ever, OMG'. It's trite, insulting, and dangerous. I fear for any impressionable young women who read this and think that this is how an ideal relationship should operate. If nothing else, it should be issued as a guidebook to mothers around the world to show their daughters the kind of man to avoid at all costs. This book does good men (and indeed, all of humanity) a disservice. *Sigh* A bestseller. They're thinking of turning it into a movie....I can't....

However, this book is so bad that I feel the need to warn others from this drivel. Luckily, I did not buy this garbage. I do not even know what overcame me to read it and I can only blame a momentary lack of judgment on my part. What baffles me is the scary fangirlgasm following this book. So what\u2019s causing it a hit? I can only come up with \u2018twilight\u2019. Doing some research, this book was originally posted online as a twilight fanfic! Yes, a twilight fanfic. The fact that this book\u2019s source material isn\u2019t a good piece of literature just shows what you should expect from this book. And dubbing it a twilight fanfic and promoting it as such is no doubt raising the bar on the sale figures. What has the world come to? *headdesk* Whatever\u2019s causing its success; I can safely say it can\u2019t be the book itself. Everything you could possibly imagine is wrong with this book! The execution and the characters. And the writing. And the plot (wait, was there one?!?) Firstly, it has been said a countless number of times how abusive Bella and Edward\u2019s relationship was. And it is arguably the most anti-feminist portrayal of any relationship. FSoG simply continues this unhealthy view and promotes an even more abusive and degrading relationship towards women, targeting older women (and possibly even teenage girls who know no better). Oh dear god, I hope teenage girls do not jump on this disturbing bandwagon. Surely, it is degrading to ask a woman to sign a contract where \u2018she is now the property of the Dominant, to be dealt with as the Dominant pleases\u2019 and \u2018submitting [herself] to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant\u2026without hesitation or argument\u2019 \u2013 especially when you take into consideration the fact that she would be signing up to something she has not yet experienced and knows little about as she is still a virgin. This is not something that should be promoted as desirable or idealistic. This book cheapens what feminists have fought for years! Don\u2019t get me wrong I wouldn't deprive women of their right to express themselves sexually, nor to act upon their desires but I shudder at the thought of women aspiring to a relationship where she will take part in various things that she is not comfortable with and at times, even when she\u2019s genuinely in fear of taking part, simply because she finds the guy \u2018hot\u2019. The plot - I\u2019m not even sure if there was one. 50% of the book is spent talking about sex/the contract and the other 50% is made up of clumsily written sex scenes. (view spoiler) [FSoG starts of with Anastasia Steele agreeing to interview the billionaire, Christian Grey. Miss Steele is instantly captivated by Mr Grey\u2019s dashing looks and within 2 days she falls in love with him. Mr Grey for some unfathomable reason can\u2019t keep away from her and reveals to her his secret kinky lifestyle. The two spend the rest of the romantic evening calmly discussing the contract that allows him to fuck her senseless. She reveals to him that she\u2019s a virgin and his only response, he needs to handle that \u2018situation\u2019. Really?!? The next 4 days, he gets to do exactly what he wants, he stalks her, abuses her and punishes her by spanking her several times. Quotes that spring to mind \u2013 \u201cPlease don\u2019t hit me\u2026don\u2019t be angry with me\u2026don\u2019t want you to spank me\u201d Aww, isn\u2019t that romantic? Atleast, she finally sees some sense and walks out. (hide spoiler) ] The writing is dull and unimaginative. It reads more like a diary \u2013 he did this, I did this. The constant repetitions are enough to make someone suicidal! I hope I never have to see the words, \u2018my subconscious\u2019 and \u2018my inner goddess\u2019 ever again or so help me god! The sex scenes were terrible and frankly a little disturbing to put down on paper \u2013 an incident with the tampon springs to mind. The characters are simply absurd in this book. AnaBella SteeleSwan Anastasia Steele irked me quite a lot and reading this book from her point of view was no picnic in the park. Finding out that she is 21 years old was a shock \u2013 she reads like a dim-witted 12 year old, who\u2019s vocabulary doesn\u2019t extend further from \u2018jeez\u2019, \u2018oh crap\u2019, \u2018damn\u2019, \u2018oh my\u2019, \u2018holy cow\u2019 and even the constant reference to her vagina as \u2018down there\u2019 . I found nothing remotely interesting about her. She has most of Bella\u2019s traits and then some \u2013 she\u2019s boring, clumsy and downright bitter, even towards her best friend, Kate. The only other word I can use to describe her is a \u2018scrounger\u2019 \u2013 can\u2019t she afford her own clothes? She\u2019s too gullible and a hypocrite. She\u2019s weak-willed and succumbs so easily for my liking. And I\u2019m pretty sure she suffers from some form of mental disorder \u2013 schizophrenia perhaps? She constantly refers to what she calls her \u2018inner goddess\u2019 and her \u2018subconscious\u2019, who either cheer her on when there\u2019s an opportunity for sex or take opportunities to call her a \u2018dirty hoe\u2019!

What\u2019s unacceptable is how his upbringing is used as an excuse to cover up his abusive tendencies. NO!! That does not give him the right to exert control over her and abuse her. Ana constantly tells him how uncomfortable and afraid she is with what he wants and all he can say is 'That\u2019s a Dom/sub thing. You\u2019ll get used to it.' . Hell NO! That's not BDSM. Okay children, let's explore the definition of BDSM: \"form of personal relationship involving the consensual use of restraint..\" Consensual being the key word! Don't tell me we have two consenting adults here. No, Ana is just a child trapped in a woman's body. She has no true idea of what this lifestyle entails and is at most times in fear. If you're still not convinced about how unhealthy this relationship was, this probably will convince you. To ensure he gets her to do what he wants, he manipulates her with promises of a relationship if she is willing to try his way of lifestyle. And, Ana being the fool she is lets him beat her thinking 'Oh my, holy cow he's hot' and 'It\u2019s what he wants...after all he\u2019s done, I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs' . So in her mind, his need to control her and beat her is a form of therapy? No! That's not BDSM either. I have absolutely nothing more to add. I'm taking my inner goddess elsewhere and grabbing a good book. Extras: Honestly this is what I imagined Christian to be like. If you have a facebook account, you should definitely visit this link .

A waste of trees, bookshelf space and precious, oh so very fucking precious braincells. Honestly, why is this even published?

And I don't mean the BDSM erotica themes, I mean the fifty levels of abuse in this friggin' thing. In fact, that's what this book should be called. 'Fifty shades of absolute-fucking-insanity-and-abuse'. I know at least every one star reviewer has taken the title and created their own pun with it, but fuck it, I'm jumping on the bandwagon too. Before I decided to read this (God help me), I kept seeing it everywhere I went, and the book store where I work was involved in the promotion among other book store chains. Typical. All me and my co-workers knew that it was smut, and a hell of a lot of it too. We even turned the book into a drinking game, and it goes as thus: Flip to a random page of the book. If it's something dirty, take a drink. I do not recommend this game, for one could die from alcohol poisoning within the first round. But if you're feeling adventurous... by all means. Glad I could be of service to your crazy party ideas. But anyway, let's cut to my opinion of this abomination of literature. I decided to read it because it sounded like garbage, and I haven't written a review about garbage in too long. I owed something to the people who actually found me worthwhile to follow on Goodreads. So I decided hell, I'll review this. Brain cells I will never, ever, EVER, get back. This is literally the worst book I have ever read, and I say that about many books. But this is the worst book for a damn good reason. Let's talk about what I hated about this book. The bottom line is I hated absolutely everything. And I'm not saying that to be funny, I'm saying that out of all seriousness. I didn't find a single redeeming quality in this book. With the Hush, hush series we at least had the unintentional hilarity and the awesomeness of Marcie. In Twilight we had that chick who wanted to kill Bella and Tyler's van. Fifty shades of Grey has no such redeeming qualities. The characters are bland and merely props to set the stage for fucking weird BDSM-ing, and the plot was lost somewhere in the vagina of the author's wet dream. (Believe me, I feel weird for even typing these words.) Not to mention, even though everyone already knows this, this was originally a Twilight fan fiction called 'Master of the universe' or some shitty, stupid title like that. How did such a thing get published? What, Twilight wasn't horrible and abuse-glorifying enough, so we had to kick it up a notch with publishing 'Master of the universe'? Are you people serious? Why is it that dumber and dumber things are getting published? Quality is almost non-existent. Fucking hell. But before I rant on for hours about that, let's talk about the characters. Oh, I mean props. Yeah, props is more appropriate. Why? Because the characters, for all the personality they had may as well have been props. Our first main prop is Ana, aka Bella Swan. The plain, virginal wallflower who thinks lowly of herself whilst everyone around her just seems to freaking worship her. She is also clumsy, reads books, has divorced parents, doesn't get along with her step-father, and is a brain dead moronic twat. Remind you of anyone? I wonder who you're thinking of. That is a humdinger, isn't it? I'm amazed how many women are not pissed off with her complete lack of sense and self-respect. She lets a man abuse her physically and emotionally, and allows him to satiate his ever-growing need to control her completely, passing it off as some cute obsessive habit. And even if she has doubts and runs away, she comes running back to him only seconds after. How are people not pissed off about this? Seriously? Not to mention she has zero personality, zero brain-cells, and zero common sense. Her character serves no purpose other than becoming some abusive asshole's sex toy. And let's not forget our second main prop, Christian Grey, aka Edward Cullen, aka creepy-stalker-sociopathic-megalomaniacal-abusive-horrifying-asshole. The fact that he has fangirls in the real world has pretty much ruined my faith in mankind, and the new generation. Christian Gray pretty much pushes the limits that Edward Cullen, Patch, Daniel and others have yet to push due to their PG ratings, but fuck does Christian Grey push those fucking limits. He physically abuses Ana, and it somehow gets excused on the account that she was briefly aroused by it. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE?? SERIOUSLY?? Fuck my life. He also decides what she should eat, what she should wear, how she should act, speak, communicate with him, where she can and can't go or what she can and can't do, threatens her constantly even with physical violence, and the list goes on. I kid you not. He even has this set out as a contract (which by the way is repeated at least 5 times in the fucking book). Here's another example of how romantic this mother fucker is: \"I like the control it gives me, Anastasia. I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you don't, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire.\" See? Romantic as freaking Mel Gibson. And by the way, the women who find this guy romantic need some serious therapy. Seriously. Harsh I know, but finding this guy romantic is like like excusing the actions of a child-molester because he has nice hair. This is not romantic. This is ABUSIVE and WRONG on sooooo many levels. I don't know why they decided to plant this book in the general romance section. This is not romantic. And don't give me the 'IT'S MEANT TO BE BDSM, SO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL DOM VS SUB'. This goes way beyond the good ol' BDSM theme and just ends up treading into abusive territory. Christian takes these aspects into the relationship where he ends up not only controlling a woman sexually, but also emotionally, and deliberately moulding her into not just a sex partner, but an ideal of what he wants her to be and leaves her no room for her individuality and instead brands it as 'punishable'. That's not part of the BDSM jig. I'm sorry, but it's not. Why people even call this romantic is beyond me. I already mentioned the abusive aspects of this so called relationship, but other than that it was a relationship built on air. Since neither of the characters had any personality outside their sex drives, they had nothing that they saw in each other. They couldn't relate to each other, they didn't share any common interests, they didn't do any good for each other, outside the sexy stuff. And at the end they want to pass it off as though the two are actually in love? Give me a break. Watching people get swooped at by magpies is more romantic that this garbage. The plot? There was no plot. Seriously, I could not find it. ANYWHERE. I searched and searched but alas, my search has left me unrewarded. Let me explain in a quick paragraph how this book goes: 'Girl meets some guy. Some guy is hot. Girl thinks some guy is hot. Hot some-guy shows up where girl who thinks some-guy is hot works. Hot some-guy asks out girl, takes her virginity. Stuff happens. Hot some-guy introduces girl (who thinks he's hot, by the way) to his BDSM sex dungeon, and the next half of the book is spent pondering whether or not girl (who thinks some-guy is hot, in case it wasn't mentioned enough in the book) wants to indulge in hot some-guy's fantasies. Also the hot some-guy takes complete control over girl (did I mention she thinks he's hot?) who seems to be totally okay with it. More stuff happens. Girl gets spanked too hard, breaks up with hot some-guy. The end.' That's it. That's the whole book. And the whole 'Ohhh Christian has secrets' bullcrap in the blurb? Bullcrap. His secrets are mentioned in only 5% of the book and drive the plot nowhere. The book is only about how some asshole wants to control some stupid girl. The other characters are barely relevant. They were just more props whose only role was to be interested in the 'relationship' between Ana and Christian. They didn't seem to be interested in anything else. They could be buttering toast and thinking 'I wonder how hard Christian is fucking Ana right now.' An absolute waste. The media might be promoting this tripe as the new hero of literature, but this is and always will be just another wart on the ass of literature, along with Twilight and all its' descendants.

If you're going to come over and here and lecture me about swearing then I'd advise that you PIPE the fuck down and stop being so bloody delicate. Alrighty, then. You guessed it, guys: it's story time. When I was thirteen, I decided I wanted to be an author. For years I'd chattered away about being an architect or a vet or what have you, but who was I kidding? All I ever wanted to do was write. So I sat down, and I did. I did write. I'm actually not shitting you. I thought it would be as easy as sitting down and writing some crap on Wordpad (alright, calm down, this was the noughties) and I wrote a lot of crap: I tried to write a play , and then I tried poetry, and then I wrote short stories, before eventually expanding into novels. Novels is a stretch. I wrote about a hundred single-spaced pages and to my present-day horror, made my family read it. And they actually did . Remember all those embarrassingly awful school projects you did when you were thirteen? Or even just those embarrassingly awful things you did in general when you were thirteen? I feel the same level of shame when I think of my little preteen self, handing this pile of shit over to my sister and thinking I actually had something. About a year later, with zero knowledge of how publishing works, I posted it straight into a bunch of indie publisher's slushpiles. A vanity publisher replied to me and told me they didn't want my work, and I did the undoable: I argued with them . As I write this, I'm practically convulsing with embarrassment. Vanity Publisher, if you're reading this, please forget I ever existed. But if you can't do that, at least give me an alias when you tell all your friends about that dumb kid who sent you the book about pyromania without having done any research. In some ways, having read this book, I finally feel like I identify with that vanity publisher: I read someone's irredeemable shit and hated it, but then they tried to defend it and I got so mad I broke a window with my face. (Peeps, if you think E.L. James hasn't tried to defend this shit, then you need to get on YouTube and watch some pleading vids from the publisher.) I just... I haven't read a book this awful since Revealing Eden (but let's not open that can of worms). It was like an acid trip. Am I reading this, I thought? Is this actually a published book? Are people actually parting with money for this slab of steaming garbage? I feel like this book insulted me, really. I feel like it spat in my face, because what reader-respecting author would create a protagonist this redundant and awe-inspiringly dense, expecting an audience to love and respect her? It's as if someone took an ice-cream scoop and relieved Ana of her brain. How could you...? Why would you...? Why is she...? I just... I have no words. I have no words to explain this protagonist. None at all. I have more to say about the love interest, who's like a more threatening Charles Manson but with only one brainwashed follower (Ana). This guy goes to the hardware store and buys like chains and lime and shit and Ana doesn't think this is weird? What the fucking fuck? And of course there's the whole \"inner goddess\" shit and Ana thinking that it's sexy to wear a chunky knit sweater and be strapped into a vehicle, and then using the word \"vagina\" during a sex scene. \"Oh, he touched my vagina\". Yeah, excuse me while I tame my boner! I felt so uncomfortable reading this book. Now, let's be honest here: I read porn. Of course I read porn. Anyone over sixteen who says they've never looked at or read porn is talking out of their ass. But this book made me feel uncomfortable, and here's the kicker: I read it alone . I was reading it alone in my living room, and I felt uncomfortable inside my own head. What the fuck does that tell you? I don't want to start yammering on about the way this book is written. It's written like horrendous fanfiction. There are spelling and punctuation errors, stupid turns of phrase, random asides, stilted dialogue, awful physical descriptions, weird pacing, and I don't know, like a thousand instances of brand dropping and band-naming which gives the book this bizarre cheap and dated quality that really takes away from what little redeeming features it might have had. What are the redeeming features? I don't know. The blurb sounds interesting. That's about it. But what is it about this book that's captured the attention of so many millions of people across the world? The absurdly stupid protagonist? The pushy, obsessive, totally unrealistic love interest? The relationship in which only one party is actually interested in BDSM, and the other is incredibly resistant to it, but is forced into it? The terrible writing? The awful cover art? The cheap, thin binding? A story so convoluted, so ridiculous, so totally immature it could only ever have been born from Twilight ? There is nothing enjoyable about this book. This book is garbage. There are no two ways about it: it is shit. Awful, awful shit. And I'm not sorry for saying so. This is my fucking opinion, and I'm damn well going to voice it. This book can kiss my ass. ...more 0 stars. DNF @55%.

And at this moment you're a part of them. - Author unknown - I've had a rather long list of issues when I decided to abandon ship. FSoShit is garbage and if I had read a paperback I would have burned the fucking offending thing. It's a total mystery to me why this book ever saw the light of day because, let's face it, the writing is incredibly juvenile. The story and characters are extremely poorly written and I couldn't for the life of me connect with the dumb, clumsy, na\u00efve and immature heroine. Also, the slimy whacko didn't deserve to be called hero. Christian is a highly manipulative, abusive and stalker-ish asshole. His whispers didn't endear him to me either. He came off as a total creep. I honestly don't understand what Ana saw in him, yet on the other hand, I didn't get it why Christian would stalk that bland and vapid wallflower. In any event, these two deserved each other and Ana obviously enjoyed Grey's blunt and crude approach. The whole contract business was pretty much mind-boggling. I don't believe that a healthy and consensual Dom/sub relationship could be based upon such crappy and ridiculous rules. Christian, the rich Superman (sarcasm), deflowered our wallflower in a way that's not even worthy of losing any words over that pathetic fuck. So, you did guess right. I neither found the sex to be hot nor erotic. At.All. Thus, I'd better buy him a ticket to the next Mars expedition stat. That would ensure that Mr. Grey would not return to our cozy place called Mother Earth. FSoG lacked depth and emotion big time. Except of disgust and anger I felt nothing towards these pathetic main protagonists and their fucked up trip bored me to tears. The winking smileys irritated the hell outta me and all that inner goddess shit made me almost blow a fuse. Jesus.Fucking.Christ. Would you give me a break already? I've read a variety of erotica books and I do enjoy great smexin' that comes with some kind of depth and great characterization. However, I'm not sorry to say that FSoG is ranking among the worst erotica books I've ever read. What's seriously bugging me as well is the fact that the general public thinks that FSoShit provides almost every woman's erotic fantasy. I don't criticize readers who loved this book but I'm criticizing the media coverage. I don't appreciate it when these people claim to know that's what a general majority of women love to read and want in real life (or in the bedroom for that matter). Seriously? Never. Ever. FSoG is bad erotica. It's bad BDSM too. When people say FSoG is \u201cempowering women in their sexuality,\u201d then I think something is seriously wrong. Never ever could this story empower me in my sexuality. What in God\u2019s name is on their minds? I can do it all by myself with my very healthy hand, and I can gladly say that my boyfriend is empowering me just fine and is taking care of my needs. Thank you very much. BTW, my boyfriend is not an abusive and manipulative stalker. Oh, yes, now it dawns on me\u2026my boyfriend is real. Bottom line, the barely there plot and the characters were overly shallow, underdeveloped, immature and boring. The amateurish writing killed any desire to read anything else by this author in the future. And last but not least, my inner goddess was so fucking relieved when she had to quit eventually. It was a very tedious and crappy experience and I wish I had never bought this book, let alone attempted to go through this rubbish. I was in dire need of bleaching my brain. Christopher Hitchens said\u2026 Everybody does have a book in them, but in most cases that's where it should stay. As a side note ...more I didn\u2019t want to start this book. Many people are praising it but I\u2019m simply not into erotica, it\u2019s too cheap for me. But here I am in the mind of the innocent waiting to be devoured by the big bad wolf. Sounds pornographic, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s because it is\u2026 Christian Grey . A hot dude that melts a woman\u2019s panties off with just one look. The perfect sex toy set out to conquer an innocent girl. Grey (the sick f*ck) is considered one of the hottest characters out there but he doesn\u2019t get to me. His I didn\u2019t want to start this book. Many people are praising it but I\u2019m simply not into erotica, it\u2019s too cheap for me. But here I am in the mind of the innocent waiting to be devoured by the big bad wolf. Sounds pornographic, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s because it is\u2026 Christian Grey . A hot dude that melts a woman\u2019s panties off with just one look. The perfect sex toy set out to conquer an innocent girl. Grey (the sick f*ck) is considered one of the hottest characters out there but he doesn\u2019t get to me. His dominance is too much for me to handle and his attitude tends to be annoying and slimy. Plus he\u2019s just wrong in the head so there\u2019s no need to add more about this creep. Anastasia is an immature insecure desperate idiot who wants to become the whore of Babylon. She just wants to listen to her inner goddess (wtf?!) and have creepy monkey sex with Grey. She has no personality nor will whatsoever, she gets excited over the smallest and most idiotic things you can imagine and even though she sees how wrong Grey (the sick f*ck) is, she still goes for it. She\u2019s always mooning over Grey like he\u2019s some kind of god that she\u2019s supposed to worship. He tells her that he doesn\u2019t want a serious relationship just sex and she\u2019s still ok with it. Why? Just because he\u2019s hot? He\u2019s a damn disgusting pervert. He hurt her the first time they made love, she was a virgin for Christ\u2019s sake ( and I don\u2019t buy the crap with it being perfect, surely she had vaginal cracks after that ), and is treating her like a slave. Even though he\u2019s a successful businessman and he\u2019s rich and famous he still can be a psychopath. Just watch American Psycho and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. Now to pick on one of my biggest problems regarding this book: THE CONTRACT . WTF may I ask? Signing paperwork in order to have sex with him? Is he a natural hazard or what? I get the whole Hey look at me I\u2019m badass, I have my own company and helicopter gig \u2018cause the guy is stinking rich but the contract??? Isn\u2019t anyone getting angry with this? I guess not... \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d \u201cTo please me\u201d Wtf?? All women want to please him? Why? \u2018Cause he\u2019s hot? He\u2019s a perverted assh*le that\u2019s what he is. He\u2019s acting like he owns everyone! Aren\u2019t you guys angry? \u201cI have rules, and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don\u2019t, I shall punish you, and you will learn,\u201d Learn this! *kicks him in the groin* Creep! \u201cIt\u2019s about gaining your trust and your respect, so you\u2019ll let me exert my will over you.\u201d Heh *right eye twitches* exert my will *eye twitches again* Aren\u2019t you guys angry with this yet?? \u2026 Question for all the people who gave this book great scores. If Grey wasn\u2019t so hot would you still have given it such great ratings? I doubt you would. So this means that the reason why you love the book is mainly Christian Grey being hot and an uber alpha? Shallow much? Or maybe you\u2019re into all the Christian Grey induced monkey sex and torture. Psycho much? But who am I to judge. This book is just a desperate woman\u2019s sick fantasy to be treated like a sex slave. I\u2019m sorry but it doesn\u2019t work for me. I DNF\u2019d this because I find it disgusting and degrading.

Okay\u2026 I realized by people's comments that I never said exactly what I thought about this book. Well, I loved it. I've now read it four times. Christian Grey ranks right up there with Travis Maddox in my book boyfriend world. This series is addicting. When I need a good read this is my \"go to\" series. I didn't know what to think about this because I wasn't sure how I felt about BDSM\u2026 but this is sooooo much more than that. One of the BEST love stories I've read to date. OOOOHHH the movie opens TODAY!! now, i'm not likely to ever see the movie, but i will say it's pretty ballsy to cast the romantic lead - a character who ties up ladies for erotic enjoyment - with the actor that many people only know as the character who ties up ladies for erotic enjoyment ... and then kills them. now hear me out, people. i liked it, but i didn't like it-like it. the writing is shitty, it is, but i am a sucker for enthusiasm. and you can tell she has it. at the reading of hers i w OOOOHHH the movie opens TODAY!! now, i'm not likely to ever see the movie, but i will say it's pretty ballsy to cast the romantic lead - a character who ties up ladies for erotic enjoyment - with the actor that many people only know as the character who ties up ladies for erotic enjoyment ... and then kills them. now hear me out, people. i liked it, but i didn't like it-like it. the writing is shitty, it is, but i am a sucker for enthusiasm. and you can tell she has it. at the reading of hers i worked, she didn't come across as some fame-hungry monster -she seems as baffled by her success as i am. it's like people with ugly kids. they know what they have brought into the world, but they love it regardless, and they're just happy when the other kids play with it on the playground. and it's not that i think she's ashamed of it, she probably thinks it is quite good, but she knows it isn't high lit or anything. and yeah, it started out as fanfiction, but i was informed rather tartly last night that she always intended to publish it and was just using the fanfic community for feedback, so any grace i was going to give to her on the grounds that \"this was intended as a tribute not initially intended for publication and so we can't judge it on the same grounds\" has been undermined. but i will keep it at three stars, because it was okay, for what it was. i rolled my eyes a lot while reading this (and in terms of this book's rules, my ass would have been so sore) but there was something about the author's dopey-puppy earnestness that i found endearing. so, final verdict: not terrible,(okay, a little terrible) but not worthy of a ny times bestseller when there are so many genuinely good books out there. onto... the sex and those of you with a knee-jerk reaction to bdsm - because i have seen comments on threads for this review that this book is about rape and beatings etc. etc. - just know that this is very hot topic bdsm - by which i mean the subculture fashion store at suburban malls, not that it is very topical and jodi picoult will write a book about it. although she probably will, now, now that all the ladies are reading this and wanting to spice up their bedroom lives with their schlubby husbands.i myself am not into the lifestyle, but as far as people i know who are, i know wayyy more female doms than male doms. let's face it, female doms have hotter clothing than female subs. and bdsm isn't about rape. it isn't about abuse. it is about trust, as dana so aptly put it last night (she is also not part of that scene. to my knowledge) but it is an arrangement . it is an understanding. there are safewords and precautions and for some people, that's just the way they are wired: top, bottom, straight, gay, dom, sub... and i hate it when people get all high-handed on the internets about kinks they don't understand. \"i got an open mind so why don't you all get inside\" but as far as this book goes, this is the most vanilla bdsm i have ever read. she's a virgin when they meet, and he is respectful of that, which was one of the better scenes in the book. but like any relationship in this fetish, they work out the details beforehand and determine their boundaries. and honestly, she is a shitty, shitty sub; she says \"no\" to a bunch of things that even i have done and i am not even kinky. and he isn't interested in things that many typical bdsm relationships would include, which ditto for that. (by which i mean i have looked a man in the eye - you don't need to know my life.) so it's very tame. if disney were going to make a bdsm movie, they would use the same contract. because real suspension?? it looks more like this: (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] or this: (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] or this: (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] what they do is what teenagers do when they are still in their experimentation stage. okay - so that's out of the way - this is bondage-lite. moving on to the rest of it, because this had a lot fewer scenes of erotic journeying than i had feared. there are still plenty, but the first scene isn't until after page 100, and after that, it isn't taking over the whole book. but there's still enough for you people who aren't reading this for the articles. twilight there is a lot of debate about whether this reads like twilight, because it started out as twilight fanfic. some people say \"yes\" some people say \"nooo.\" i am here to break that tie. OF COURSE IT READS LIKE TWILIGHT!!! are you mad?? ALL the twilightisms are there: the \"i'm bad for you\" speeches, the emphasis on smells, the ineffable attraction of a perfect and wealthy man to an underdescribed, clumsy and tongue-tied female who is all \"who, me??\" with all of the self-doubt and self-esteem issues, all the \"how can such a perfect specimen fall for li'l ole me??\", the seeecrets and the endless endless repetitions.and those repetitions make the book so frequently annoying.but that's not her fault, not if that is what she is going for. it's actually quite remarkable that she was able to mimic meyer's style to that extent. sure, it's irritating as hell, but as an homage, it's quite accomplished.i have decided to interpret her linguistic quirks as homage, not as weak writing. feel free to disagree - it's just my take on it. (although the writing is frequently weak in other areas as well. i am just feeling generous.) language first of all, e.l. james is british. and yet - because this is twilight fanfic, she had to set it in washington state. but no one told her how we talk. pssst - we use our present perfect tense differently than you do. yes, even those of us who are/were lit majors. when americans say things like \"i've not been there\" etc, it sounds pompous. sorry to you americans who do talk like that, but it does. it sounds affected. especially in erotic fiction set in washington state. miscellaneous there are so many gasps in here, it may as well have been titled the great gaspy . i personally have never heard a man gasp with lust in response to something i have said. how do i do this? does he have a breathing disorder? why are his eyes always darkening? i have never noticed this phenomenon, but it is a staple of romance novels. i was not aware this could actually happen. biting of the lips, linen, inner goddess, subconscious, medulla oblongata, blushing, control freak... get used to these words. there are at least 50 occurrences of these words on every page. characters i do not understand his attraction to our heroine. she never says anything interesting, except in her emails. those emails are the best part of this book. she shows more personality there than in any conversation, and that's just odd, to me. i'm not sure why i was expecting much more from a character whose favorite book is tess , because you know how i feel about that book, but i was glad to see thomas hardy pop up frequently, even if it is my least favorite of his books. and christian is also unstable and mercurial and full of anger towards peccadilloes. and - god - his food issues. even without his sexual needs, this guy is a piece of work. i'm not sure i could put up with someone so changeable, even if he was an uncommonly gorgeous billionaire who wanted to buy me old and expensive books... gotta draw the line somewhere. plus, once i saw the leather bed, i'd be outta there. that's just gross, all sticky and germ-encouraging. i don't know - i wanted to write a much better review for this book - there was so much i wanted to say, but i am feeling lazy right now. i feel weird giving it three stars, because there was so much about this book i didn't like, but the three-stars here is more of a \"i thought it was going to be so much worse than it is\" and my deeply charitable heart which overlooks weaknesses in favor of an author's zeal. but here, enjoy this link of gilbert gottfried reading this book aloud: http://www.collegehumor.com/embed/677... and here are three other options, if you'd rather giggle: fifty shades of grey pussy cats a coupla shades of taupe fifty shames of earl grey [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I read this book back before E.L.

Add in culture confusion: Ana is supposed to be American, but the author (who is from the U.K.) keeps having Ana use Britishisms! Her roommate isn't \"sick\" like American people are, she's \"ill\"; Ana doesn't \"grab her bag\" before going out the door, she \"gathers her satchel\". Ana's voice fails to consistently ring true for an American girl. Yet, the worst literary crime is the outright misuse of language. Says Ana at one point: \"The elevator whisks me with terminal velocity to the twentieth floor.\" Um...terminal velocity occurs when the downward force of gravity equals the upward force of drag, and it can't be reached by a controlled-speed mechanism that draws an object upward (such as an elevator). Even if the author didn't know this, the editor should have caught it. The problems don't end there. From cliches (without a lick of irony or humor, Ana is described as putting the \"pedal to the metal\" as she drives), to awkward sentences, to nonsensical metaphors, this work is amateurish. There's nothing wrong with being an amateur, but there IS something wrong with charging people money for something that hasn't been professionally edited. If this author wants to be taken seriously, she should take the time to learn about writing craft and align herself with an editing house that will turn her writing into serious work. ...more Post Script on May 8, 2012 This book has exploded since I first read it and it seems to be one that is either loved or hated.

No. Were these characters ones whom you could write grad school theses about? No. But you know what? I loved the romance, I loved the chemistry, and I enjoyed myself tremendously while reading it - it had me grinning ridiculously for hours. That's what I wanted from this book, and that's what I got, so for me, that was enough. Post Post Script on October 9, 2012 I greatly appreciate all those who have defended my review in the comments section - especially those who completely disagreed with my opinion of the book. For those making hateful comments: you don't like the book, people who did are apparently driving you crazy, so my advice: stop reading all the positive reviews!! Age-old rule: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Post Post Post Script on January 13, 2017 Almost 500 comments on this review, but none for awhile, so not sure why I'm coming back to it now. I started reading the most recent comments though and my own review, and frankly I wanted to delete some of it, but figured that was ridiculous at this point. I wouldn't write this same review were I to read it now, but that was what I thought that morning at the time right after I read it, so it is what it is. Finally watched the movie recently, which is probably what brought me round to this, and for the record: yes, Christian does f*cked up shit (they don't even get to all of it in the movie) and were this real-life, I would have advised her to get a restraining order, because wtf. But it's not. Anyway. I wrote what I wrote; I was in my early 20s; I liked it. Peace xo Sincerely, Juliana * Actual Review Begins Here * 5+ stars. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. I still feel somewhat under the spell of this book. I'm so ... beguiled by it ;-) (book allusion). It was honestly an amazing read - and one which I meant to just skim a few sample pages of, but ended up buying and then staying up the entire night to finish. I wasn't even sure I wanted to write a review, because it seemed too difficult to put into words everything that moved me about this story and to try to do it justice. This ended up feeling like one of the best and most authentic romances I have read. In some ways, I feel conflicted like Anastasia when I say that: my instinct is to say that can't be, because of what their relationship revolves around / how it's constructed ... but somehow it can be and it's true. Anastasia, Christian, and their relationship are all so honestly and openly written and shown to us that there is no other way for me to feel. Even though its counterintuitive, I can't help but feel that their relationship is one of the most beautiful, complex, and emotional ones I've read in the romance genre. It's one of those books that makes me want to go back to the last few 4-5 star books I read and knock down their ratings half a star, because when put on the same scale they don't compare. I had a ridiculously foolish grin on my face throughout the entire thing, both because I was on one of those this-romance-is-unbelievably-fantastic highs and the book had some surprisingly good humor. I had a pleasant feeling of anticipation as I read, but I was also extremely nervous, because real BDSM sub/dom books are not my thing, and so while I was falling increasingly in love with Ana and Christian with every new page I read, I was also terrified that I was going to be jarringly yanked out of it all and the whole experience ruined for me by some kinky and needlessly over-the-top BDSM scene. Thankfully, that never happened, and it remained an amazing read right up until the very end. { Not What I Expected } I'm not normally a BDSM book reader, but this was so, so, SO much more than just that. I don't think that I have read one that is so beautifully and (seemingly) authentic. I write seemingly because I have no personal experience, so no idea, but to me it read that way. It was not done as a space apart in the book where the writer could insert random hot sex scenes. Instead, it's woven throughout, showing us how it impacts and affects both characters. Ana and Christian remain Ana and Christian in those scenes, in the sense that it doesn't feel like out-of-character gratuitous sex scenes are at every random turn just to satisfy some quota. I'm not even sure I want to categorize this book as erotica, because that seems so limiting. (There was hot - intense - chemistry, don't get me wrong, and I definitely had some turn-the-AC-up moments). { Loved our Heroine: Anastasia / Ana (21) } Anastasia was one of the best heroines, because she felt so real and her reactions each and every time were so normal! Not over-the-top for effect, but not understated because the author wants to be able to put lots of sex scenes. She's a virgin, has no experience with men, and didn't know anything about BDSM, so of course she's going to be questioning this and unsure of whether it's \"right\" or it's \"wrong\" or if she even feels comfortable doing it. She also is very attracted - and eventually in love - with Christian and wants to be in a relationship with him. Ana feels a connection to him that she has never felt with any other person and she wants him in her life; he makes her happy. Her attempts to balance these two forces is wonderfully depicted and I could easily imagine myself reacting in those exact same ways, thinking those exact same things, and feeling those exact same conflicts. Ana is strong - she's somewhat shy and quiet, but like all real people, you cannot fit her into only one category: she may seem reserved and quiet, but she can also stand up for herself and really knows her own mind - she is not the ideal sub Christian first thinks she might be. Ana examines her motivations and feelings when she's confused or unsure - not only about what she should do, but about what she wants to do and what Christian wants from her. The story is told in first-person, which is sometimes iffy for me, but it worked well here; Ana's tone as narrator is smart, self-aware, and immensely likable. { Adored our Hero: Christian (27) } Christian is one of the best heroes. He's intense and dark and I know some people still see him as mysterious and the dark force in all this, but I actually found him to be so accessible. There are still things we need to know about his history, obviously - I have some guesses, but don't know anything for sure. Nonetheless, he also felt like the most authentic BDSM dom I could ever read because he's not just that - he's a man who has that part of himself incorporated into his life, personality, and mannerisms, so that it's integral to his character, even when we see him around other characters who don't know about this part of his life. Christian is possessive, a little stalkerish, domineering (no duh), authoritarian, elusive, mercurial - all of those things and more. He is also one of the most tender, tortured, and sensitive heroes I've ever read. His despair and his need for Ana is his life are like living, breathing things and they jump off the page. He also has a deep understanding about himself and his desires, though he discovers and faces new things through Ana's questions and confrontations. He needs to dominate and control his partner, but he also needs Ana, so he is willing to compromise and not only tries to give her that \"more,\" but ends up wanting it himself as well. { An Unbelievable Connection and Relationship } From the first page of their encounter, the chemistry between Anastasia and Christian was off the charts . It was one of the things that convinced me to buy the book after reading the sample - it was so intense. Their connection throughout feels so strong and despite the fact that they're coming from such different places, you can see the constant back and forth of them trying to fit together, trying to understand what the other wants, what they themselves want, etc. The dialogue, the emails , the EVERYTHING between them is a m a z i n g !!! I had such a ridiculous grin on my face for most the entire book. This goes back to my first point, but I was just so amazed by how realistic their relationship seemed, despite the BDSM sub/dom factor, which to me seems so foreign. It was complex, difficult, lovely, distressing, uplifting, intense, hopeful. { This Book Felt So Honest } And I mean this in multiple ways: the main characters, their relationship, and the subject matter. Reading this book feels like an intimate act, because Ana and Christian are truly laid bare for us; yes, there are still things about his past we don't know, but who they are, their essentials, are revealed to us. Their relationship is so honest, and I mean this in two ways: within the book and how the reader sees it. Within the book, I so, SO loved that they both try to be open with one another about their feelings and their doubts, that we see them trying to work through this relationship and feel each other out, figure out what this is between them. Loved, loved, LOVED it! Also, for the reader how their connection is shown, both in terms of man-woman and sub/dom felt very, very honest. It wasn't porn-like or gratuitous or kinky for kink's sake - it was built off of who these two people are and how they connect with and need one another. { Overall Fantastic } Surprisingly funny and sweet! Fantastic secondary characters. No evil guy or superfluous subplot - the obstacles are within themselves and their relationship and that is more than enough; anything else would have ruined the book and taken away from their story. Subtle but sizzling chemistry and sexual tension. Complex characters. Etc, etc. { Ending of the Book / Series } (no spoilers) *Important to know that Ana and Christian's story does not end here.* The ending is jarring, though I had ruined it for myself by having already read the next book's summary ( Fifty Shades Darker , due out September 15 ). I think the buildup should definitely have been extended, because it did feel pretty out of the blue to me. As little a thing as it is, the fact that the end says \"End of Part One\" and this isn't viewed as Book 1 and the next as Book 2, really made a difference to me. Gives more of a sense of continuity and makes this feel like an intermission. I love where the book / series titles come from, lol (Christian's remark to Ana that he's \"fifty shades of f*cked-up\"). Note: All together, there will be three books. For those interested but unsure, Google has a relatively long sample section you can read to get a sense of whether you'll like the book or not: http://books.google.com/ebooks?id=wR7... (Written August 17, 2011) My review for Fifty Shades Darker ...more I have finally made a decision about Fifty Shades of Grey . I know, I know, my review of this isn't really needed, everybody's talking about this book, everybody's got the general gist of what it's about. But I've spent quite a long time thinking about this novel, the characters, and the relationship portrayed. I've been thinking about all the reasons people hate this so much and love it so much. I need to confess - for those who missed it - that I originally reviewed this first book immediately I have finally made a decision about Fifty Shades of Grey . I know, I know, my review of this isn't really needed, everybody's talking about this book, everybody's got the general gist of what it's about. But I've spent quite a long time thinking about this novel, the characters, and the relationship portrayed. I've been thinking about all the reasons people hate this so much and love it so much. I need to confess - for those who missed it - that I originally reviewed this first book immediately after finishing it and before I started (and finished) the other two books in the trilogy. I gave it three stars, I expressed all that Fifty Shades of Grey had made me feel: annoyed, frustrated, confused, and also entertained. I have since then felt like I have much more to add. The reason I personally think that opinions differ so greatly on these novels is not because people have different sexual tastes. For some, yeah, this will come into play. However, I think the main reason is that this book and the characters send out a confusing mix of messages. When I finished Fifty Shades of Grey , I had no idea what kind of book I'd just read. Was it BDSM erotica? Or the tale of a man's childhood abuse and how this impacted on his sex life later on? Were Christian Grey's sexual tastes supposed to be erotic or wrong? Let me tell those of you who haven't read this: it isn't clear. This book appears to be an erotic BDSM romance at face value. But Ana makes it clear early on that she doesn't want that kind of relationship, that Christian is \"fifty shades of fucked up\", that the way he behaves isn't right, but is actually the result of an abusive upbringing. Ana later contradicts her early decision and gets all pouty when Christian won't play kinky with her... and yet the previous time he'd done it she spent the evening crying and feeling sorry for herself. Some people seem to see Christian as the big bad man who abuses a weak young woman. This is not the case. There is nothing, I repeat nothing , that happens between the two of them that Ana doesn't give consent to. Sure, she may whine about it afterwards, or use the excuse that she doesn't want to lose him, but she makes the choices, she holds the power. Here's what I think is the ultimate problem with Fifty Shades of Grey : Ms James' terrible writing. It's nothing new, she even admitted it herself, but that is why we all can't figure out what it is about this book that makes it some parts entertaining, some parts annoying as fuck. Because I'm trying to categorise this so I can begin to understand it, so that I can form my opinion and write my review accordingly. But we cannot understand what doesn't make sense. And James' characterisation does not make any sense at all. She writes Ana as a naive student at the mercy of Christian's abusive past, then she writes Ana as a sexual manipulator who actually likes BDSM. Is Christian sexy or a victim? I'll tell you: he's both and neither, because James cannot create characters and relationships to save her life. She contradicts herself, she changes her mind without logical reason. This is why it is pointless analysing the relationship between Ana and Christian. One minute it's sexy, the next minute it's fucked up. One minute it's BDSM, the next minute it's abuse. How do you accurately review a book that changes its mind every two minutes? I also feel I need to say something about BDSM. Any more than a small amount of kinky doesn't really interest me, but it doesn't bother me either if it is between consenting adults. However, there are two things I can say about this matter in Fifty Shades of Grey : 1) it really isn't that kinky, and 2) for the most part, this isn't really a BDSM relationship (I don't think the author actually understands what one is). I can't say that I'm experienced in visiting those kind of clubs down the dark allies of Soho, but I've done not a small amount of reading on the psychological aspect of BDSM relationships. I have a keen interest in feminism and I have often wondered if something like this is nothing but a hindrance to the progress of women and equality. I would conclude from my reading that it is not. Firstly, BDSM relationships are about give and take. The dom and the sub each give one another what they want/need. It isn't about abuse, it isn't about selfishly taking what you want, and because these relationships involve relinquishing control to another person, there is a deep amount of trust required. Also, it is important to note that the power of the dom is an illusion, the sub holds all the power, they say how far it goes, when it stops, what is too much. The key thing is that both of them get something out of it . Which is why the relationship in Fifty Shades of Grey can only be called BDSM when Ana does an abrupt u-turn on her opinions and decides she wants a bit of spankiness. The parts where she is upset about the relationship Christian wants - that is not BDSM. The parts where she reluctantly allows him to get his way - that is not BDSM. I think there is nothing wrong with BDSM erotica. I think there is nothing wrong with doms, subs, sex slaves, whatever... if that is what the person wants. But Fifty Shades of Grey is about 10% BDSM relationship and 90% bad writing that just fucks with your head until you're not sure what the hell you're reading. Ms James has created one mess of a book, whether you'll look at her mess and see something entertaining or horrific, well that's kinda just like looking at this picture and asking whether you see a rabbit or a duck. ...more I feel like there is a deeper meaning behind Fifty Shades of Grey then just BDSM and sex but the huge downfall of this book was the writing. I can see both sides of the fifty shades argument. There are points in the book where I can see abuse but there are also points where there is none. I just hate the fact that if people enjoy this book they are labeled as \"pro-rape advocates\" or \"pro-abuse\". STOP IT. Stop trying to belittle others, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

Well, that was me while reading this book, I couldn't concentrate to get anything done :) There are a lot of reviews on this book, and obviously the majority love it, so I am simply going to explain some of the reasons that this story grabbed hold of my heart and wouldn't let go. First, I am a total sucker for the tortured hero and you would be hard pressed to find a hero more tortured that our own beloved Christian Grey. That said, the fact that he is a gazillionaire at age 27 is nothing to shake a stick at! Christian's intensity and focus is what really captured me in all this, I keep having to remind myself how old he is. The chemistry between Anastasia & Christian is just off the friggin' charts, I swear at times I could feel it coming right off the pages, from the moment she 'fell' into his office!! :) I really enjoyed the BDSM element, it wasn't necessarily heavy but intense, especially listening to Christian tell Ana that he WANTED to hurt her and why. When he said he had never had to explain it before and knew he wasn't explaining well just melted my heart. There is such a vulnerable, sweet boy underneath that gorgeous domineering man! Obviously you can tell I am completely smitten with Christian, but let me tell you a little bit about why I completely love Ana too. Even though she is an innocent, oh and I mean really innocent, I can't help but love her fire! Yes, just like the rest of the female population she has fallen completely under Christian's spell but she is not willing to just submit to his every whim - She's feisty but conflicted, I love the emotion!! Now, I could wax poetic about this book all day long but I will instead say if you haven't read this and you enjoy a read that will stay with you for days after you finish it then I cannot recommend this enough!! GO GET IT - RIGHT NOW!!! That's right, shouty capitals!! LOL - I myself finished this one and jumped right into Fifty Shades Darker because like I said, I can't get enough!! Soooo.....

This piece of shit, this sorry excuse for a book is without a doubt the worst piece of literature fanfiction I have ever read. I have never suffered so much in my life. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Normally I\u2019d add a short summary of the plot, but there is no fucking plot. Boy meets girl, boy is a fucking psychopath, girl does as she\u2019s told, lots of sex, lots of whining. The parts that didn\u2019t have sex bored me out of my goddamn mind, and the parts that did have sex were so absurd and revolting that I couldn\u2019t go on reading without raging on Goodreads about it. I seriously cannot wrap my head around the fact that this is a bestseller. That women all over the world adore this book, and adore Christian Grey. The man is an abusive stalker and the fact that women are fantasising about this fuckwit sets our society back about 500 years. Thanks for that, wankers. Reasons why you should run away from Christian Grey and possibly shoot and castrate him Oh boy, where do I start? * He tracks her fucking phone. Strike one. \"How did you find me?\" \"I tracked your cell phone Anastasia.\" Oh, of course he did. How is that possible? Is that legal? Stalker , my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that's still floating in my brain, but somehow, because it's him, I don't mind. Because it\u2019s not stalking if the guy is hot! * \u201cWell, if you were mine, you wouldn\u2019t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.\u201d Strike two. * \u201cYou should steer clear from me.\u201d Strike three, and he should be out. Go home, thank you for playing. But the list goes on. * Christian\u2019s endless commanding and controlling Anastasia. \u201cSit.\u201d \u201cCome.\u201d \u201cEat.\u201d Like she\u2019s a fucking dog. Worst of all, Anastasia would happily wag her tail and roll over for him. * More stalker tendencies: he knows where she lives without her telling him. When Kate and Ana move house to Seattle, he again knows where she lives without her telling him. And then, when Ana flies to Georgia to escape , not only does he know where her mother lives, he also knows her mother\u2019s last name, knows which flight Ana is on, and follows her to Georgia . Without her permission. And he happens to stay in the hotel she\u2019s having dinner at. Fucking hell. If that\u2019s not an alarm bell, I don\u2019t know what is. This guy is fucking insane. * Bipolar tendencies. One moment, he\u2019s all nice, the next, he becomes dark and cold. Just the mere mention of another guy gets him angry. He becomes all moody when there\u2019s another male presence around Ana. It\u2019s sickening. * He gets a thrill out of how young Ana looks with pigtails. * Not only does he tell her when to eat, he also orders her drinks and food for her, without taking into account what she wants. \u201cIs this what our err\u2026 relationship will be like?\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou, ordering me around?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he murmurs. The BDSM contract is the perfect example of this: \u201cThe Submissive will ensure she achieves a minimum of seven hours sleep a night when she is not with the Dominant.\u201d \u201cThe Submissive will not snack between meals, with the exception of fruit.\u201d \u201cDuring the term, the Submissive will wear clothing only approved by the Dominant.\u201d \u201cThe Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions.\u201d \"The Submissive shall accept whippings, floggings, spankings, caning, paddling or any other discipline the Dominant should decide to administer, without hesitation, enquiry or complaint.\u201d \u201cThe Submissive shall not touch or pleasure herself sexually without permission from the Dominant.\u201d \u201cThe Submissive shall submit to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant and shall do without hesitation or argument.\u201d \u201cThe Submissive shall not look directly into the eyes of the Dominant except when specifically instructed to do so.\u201d Not only that, but you will undergo any beauty treatment I tell you, wax whenever and wherever I tell you, and be available every weekend. I really hope I don\u2019t need to explain how sick this is. * The guy is an absolute control freak. \"You've not eaten very much.\" \"I've had enough.\" \u201cThree oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and you\u2019ve not eaten all day.\u201d He\u2019s keeping a fucking inventory of the things she eats. He also keeps track of how many orgasms he\u2019s given her. And he gets angry when Ana decides to go away for a bit, even if it\u2019s just to visit her mother. \u201cPalm-twitchingly mad.\u201d * He doesn\u2019t give two shits about what Ana wants. Ana has mentioned a dozen times about how she doesn\u2019t want Christian to buy her things. So he buys her 14,000-dollar-worth old books, a Macbook, a Blackberry, and a fucking car. * He\u2019s obviously a creep. He gives her grades like she\u2019s a bloody school girl. Worst of all \u2013 she\u2019s proud of it too. \u201cSwallowing semen\u2026 well, you get an A in that.\u201d I flush, and my inner goddess smacks her lips together with glowing pride. Just.. yikes. He also says he\u2019d \u201cpay good money\u201d to see her consult with a gynaecologist. What the fuck is wrong with you?! And he has rape tendencies: \u201cNo one\u2019s ever said no to me before. And it\u2019s so \u2013 hot.\u201d * He doesn\u2019t like it when she asks personal questions, yet has no qualms with invading her privacy three times over. * He wants to own Ana. He wants her to be his possession. Like she\u2019s a fucking car. Even more alarm bells: 1. \u201cYou scare me when you\u2019re angry.\u201d 2.\tHe spanks her so hard that she can\u2019t sit down from the pain. \u201cHoly fuck it hurts.\u201d 3.\tAbout the spanking: \u201cDuring the whole alarming process I felt demeaned, debased and abused.\u201d 4.\tTo which he replies: \u201cI am tempted to drive back over there to ensure that you don\u2019t sit down for a week, rather than an evening.\u201d 5.\tAna never cries, until she meets Christian. Suddenly, she cries all the time. 6. \u201cTake some Advil \u2013 this is not a request. And don\u2019t drive your Beetle.

I can\u2019t hide the horror on my face.\u201d Right, I think there are enough examples here. This is beyond fucked up. On to the writing. It was horrible . Every single word was overused. I am going to shoot someone if I ever have to hear \u201coh my\u201d or \u201choly cow\u201d again. If I have to read one more mention about how she bites her lip, or how s/he gasps, or how their breaths hitch. Worst of all \u2013 \u201cdown there \u201d. You\u2019re already being racy by writing BDSM. At least use proper terms. Vagina. Pussy. Vulva. Lady bottom. Muff. Vajayjay. Hoo-ha. Bojingo. Box. Cave. Clam. Flower. Coin purse. Cooch. Cunt. Twat. Dragon's lair. Slot machine. Taco. Fanny. Beaver. Gash. Honey pot. Sausage wallet. Venus fly trap. ANYTHING. The subconscious/inner goddess shit annoyed me to no end. \u201c I flush at the waywardness of my subconscious - she's doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.\u201d \u201cMy inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.\u201d \u201cMy inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms.\u201d \u201cMy inner goddess is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast.\u201d It was like the author was desperately trying to make Anastasia sound intelligent, especially when she used terms such as \u201cmedulla oblongata\u201d. When we all know she\u2019s a dumb cunt, because she signs contracts without reading them. The fact that she keeps running back to Christian also signifies that she has an IQ of a garden gnome. There was also the constant need to remind us that Christian Grey is good-looking. Seriously, every time she saw him there was mention of how hot he was, and every time she thought of him, as well. \u201cAdonis\u201d, \u201cMichelangelo\u2019s David has nothing on him\u201d, someone pass me a bucket. Then there are the inaccuracies . Anastasia has to be some kind of Superwoman. No hangover after drinking tequila for the first time. She\u2019s never been drunk in her life, yet she can wolf down a massive breakfast easily the next morning. Then, when her virginity is absolutely destroyed by Christian (literally \u2013 \u201che slams into me\u201d / \u201cas he rips through my virginity\u201d ), she comes twice and is happy to do it again right away. She has no pain whatsoever. She\u2019s also perfectly able to take it doggy style after just losing her virginity, because why the fuck not. On top of that, she's instantly exceptional at everything. Must be great, to be a natural. No awkwardness whatsoever. At one point, she gasps and swallows at the same time. I tried to do it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. Things that I think were supposed to be sexy but really weren\u2019t \u201cThe walls and ceiling are a deep, dark burgundy, giving a womb-like effect to the spacious room.\u201d \u201cTwo orgasms\u2026 coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.\u201d \u201cHe slowly inserts his thumb inside me, rotating it round and round, stroking the front wall of my vagina.\u201d After which he sticks his bloody thumb in her mouth. \u201cI pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls around the end. He\u2019s my very own Christian Grey flavour popsicle .\u201d Not only is that disgusting, but I find it hard to believe that she thinks giving blowjobs is a turn-on. I find nothing sexy about testing my gag reflex repeatedly. As if Christian read my mind, he goes, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a gag reflex?\u201d Words every girl wants to hear. \u201cMy heated blood pools low in my belly.\u201d Is she on her period? \u201cStop biting your lip, or I will fuck you in the elevator, and I don\u2019t care who gets in with us.\u201d Whoa there, cowboy. \u201cI\u2019d really like to claim your ass, Anastasia.\u201d What, you\u2019re going to put a flag up there? The tampon scene. Things I learned from Fifty Shades of Grey: * If your future mother-in-law practically catches you having sex with her son, don\u2019t worry \u2013 she\u2019ll be delighted to meet you, because it means her son is not gay. * Find someone who\u2019s willing to be your Dominant. That way, you never have to make any decisions again! He\u2019ll decide what and when you eat and drink, when and how long you sleep, what you wear, what you drive, when you exercise\u2026 easy! * Your first time will not be painful, even if you\u2019ve never masturbated before. Not even if he slams into you! You won\u2019t feel a thing. In fact, you\u2019ll like it and you\u2019ll come twice. Then you\u2019ll want to do it again straight away! * You look plain. That\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll still have three hot guys fighting over you. * When a girl you barely know is drunk, it\u2019s probably a good idea to take her back to your place, take off her trousers, and sleep in the same bed as her. * You can\u2019t get pregnant when you\u2019re on your period. (Honestly, I\u2019m surprised this fuckwit hasn\u2019t knocked anyone up before Ana) Christian Grey, I hope you get a blowjob by a motherfucking shark. You sick son-of-a-bitch.

There were just too many things about her that turned me off bigtime. I can understand how her vulnerability could make you warm to her, but it just made me frustrated more than anything. The attraction between Christian and Ana was intoxicating and I was invested in it for sure, but the way that Ana was written really let her down in my opinion. She was an innocent young woman with no sexual experience but her immaturity and childish demeanor really astounded me. At 21 surely she would have had a bit more understanding of the way the world works. The whole \"inner goddess vs subconscious\" thing was so ridiculous and referred to so many times that I literally wanted to beat my head open with my e-reader. And also - pigtails. PIGTAILS on a 21 year old are so not okay. I'm sorry but what?? Her completely contradictory behaviour - wide eyed innocence and being totally petrified by Christian's sexual tastes but thinking it's hot at the same time. I validate her reasoning behind being nervous about it but honestly why go through with it? If that's the only way you're going to be able to have Christian - by signing up for something like that - then do it. But don't carry on about it for the entire book. You're either invested in him and the relationship or not at all. I'm sorry but I'm a realist. Another example of Ana's immaturity and contradictory behaviour is how she got so angry at Kate for trying to rile Christian up and stoke his jealousy but then Ana did the exact same thing herself on the next page when she got the massage in first class and told him all about it. The game playing did not warm me to her whatsoever. In my status updates and other comments I stated how I felt the writing was awful. I really did, at least in the first half. The first person POV didn't help matters either; the narrative was so stilted and had no flow. It read like, \"I did this and then this happened and I walked here and I made my bed\". The lack of structure was amateurish and painful and made me wonder if the book had been edited at all. So now that I've got that off my chest let's talk about what I did like. A gorgeous multi-millionaire that becomes almost obsessed with you and wants to keep you for his very own? Any girl's ultimate fantasy right? That aspect of this story is what got me hooked. The fact that Christian had a particular method and structure with his relationships also really drew me in. A dominant hero who finds himself in lust (and maybe even in love) with an innocent is quite fascinating to me and kept me reading. (view spoiler) [The BDSM didn't bother me at all perhaps until the very end when the shit hit the fan. (hide spoiler) ] And then miracle of miracles, Ana actually grew on me towards the latter part of the book. I found myself very emotionally involved especially in the last 30 or so pages and it was interesting the way the chips fell. That is why I intend to read the next book in the series where no doubt I will be huffing and puffing about Ana all over again. As an update..... I can't believe my review is getting so many likes 9 months after reading this book. I thought I should let y'all know that I haven't touched this trilogy since stumbling my way through this way back then. ...more This is what you're getting from reading this book: C-Christian and A-Anastasia C-Hi!

First, here is a mini review of this book in two GIFs: About the plot: About the writing: Got that?? OK, now more of my sordid thoughts on this MASTERPIECE (**cough, cough**): So I shamelessly caved and read this book after repeatedly swearing I never would, but the publicity and hype finally won me over. (I also got a free copy of the book, no way was I going to pay for this.) And while I now have a better understanding of the fascination, I still don\u2019t get it. Sure, there were some hot sex scenes, and at times Grey and Ana were both likable characters. I eventually even understood their fascination with each other. And I liked them when they were away from the whole BDSM/punishment/discipline/control freaky shit. Grey even had the sexual stamina of ten horny rabbits put together! What\u2019s not to like about that? (Dang, that man is always hard and ready!!) But so much of this book was utterly disturbing! It primarily focused on Grey trying to coerce and manipulate her into being what HE needed, despite how much it would hurt her. He claimed to care for her and was patient, but it always boiled down to his need to punish and inflict pain. Outwardly he came across as a suave, polished and sophisticated normal person, but inwardly he was one sick dude. There were times they really were a great couple, but only when they were in a \u2018normal\u2019 environment. When the BDSM environment was involved, I wasn\u2019t a fan of either of them. Initially I couldn\u2019t understand what the heck Grey saw in Ana. A clumsy, mousy na\u00efve girl who face plants on the ground (TWICE!), and then pukes her drunken gut out. (Uh right, what guy wouldn't get hot for a girl like that?) His quick attachment to her had me baffled for nearly the first half of the book. If all he wanted was a submissive with no romantic ties, why chose her? By his own words he no problem finding consenting partners before. After Grey reveals his proclivities, I figured Ana would run for the hills if she had a brain in her head. Unfortunately, she is a na\u00efve virgin with no experience to even compare him to, and the poor girl is so blinded by how \u201cOMG, he\u2019s so HOT!\u201d So when she actually entertains his twisted notions and begins negotiating terms of hard and soft limits, I wanted to scream at her! How stupid and na\u00efve are you girl?!! WTF?? WHY?? She was too trusting, too unaware, and he was painting one rosy ass picture of how wonderful his lifestyle would be for her. Sorry, but signing over your free will into a sexual contract where you WILL get hurt is just F\u2019d up, especially when your gut feelings are constantly telling you to flee. I\u2019ll give Grey bonus points for his honesty at being so upfront with Ana, but that doesn\u2019t make what he is about any less of a predator. He was honest with her about not wanting a normal \u2018hearts and flowers\u2019 relationship. If she agreed, she would be his submissive and enter into TRAINING. All he has to do is brainwash her into believing she would actually prefer this life style over the normal one she dreamed of. (WTF??!) Another aspect I did not get was how Ana repeatedly accuses him of having commitment issues, but throughout the book it was her that had one foot in the relationship and the other foot well outside of the door. He on the hand was far more committed, albeit with a strict set of \u2018rules\u2019. Despite all the WTFery and the disturbing portrayal of a young woman being coerced into an unknown and unsafe world, I was fascinated with the overall story. Like watching a train wreck fascinated, and nothing to be proud of. I found myself wanting to read just one more chapter and then another. So yes, this book was hard to put down. It was also hard not to pitch it at the wall! I honestly thought I would not want to read about BDSM, but surprisingly that aspect didn't even bother me all that much until the end (view spoiler) [The hard spanking scene was just cruel, as intended, and beyond disturbing!! (hide spoiler) ] . If this was about two mutual consenting adults who fully understood what they were getting into, I might have even enjoyed it. But the constant coercion and manipulation killed the book for me. In the end this book really made me want to scrub myself clean with Christian's own go-to cure for all those bruising sore asses. (Oh, lovely!) Take some Advil. And rub on some Arnica cream to sooth \u2018bruising, sprains and injuries\u2019. The writing is another issue with this book. It wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as I feared, but the euphemistic inner dialogue drove me nuts. The book often read like a comic book script, not a serious contemporary novel. All of the Oh, my! GASP! whoa! What?! Kabam! Pow Pow! (OK, not the last couple ones, but the rest are real!) were tiresome and over-done to death. Well\u2026love it or hate it, this was one controversial and thought provoking book, just WAY too distributing for my personal taste. They say one man's trash is another man's treasure, and maybe in this case one woman's trashy mommy porn is another woman's hot treasured erotica. (Oh, Nora Roberts this is not!)

Mr Ed Miliband! \"Ed Miliband Reviews 50 Shades of Grey (whilst Ceilidh hopes this doesn't result in her party membership being revoked!)\" Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing us to have this emergency meeting in the House of Commons to discuss this incredibly important manner in a polite, democratic fashion. As many of you may know, the publishing house Vintage recently purchased the erotic romance series 50 Shades of Grey, written by E.L. James, for a seven figure sum, thus allowing her to benefit from the Chancellor's recent top rate tax cut. I'm sure he'll be delighted to take responsibility for that. This book, originally published online as Twilight fan-fiction, has angered many in the literary community, especially those who feel that the author exploited fandom and copyrighted material for her own personal gain. The people are angry, Mr Speaker, and since this complacent government won't take it upon themselves to listen to the will of the people, not the corporations, I decided to read the book myself to see what all the fuss was about. It was... enlightening. First of all, it's heinously written. It makes the NHS bill look like a Booker prize winner. I can't help but wonder if the author was being paid by the ellipses. The British author just cannot write authentic American dialogue to save herself. It doesn't matter how many times the heroine gets called 'baby', that won't hide the frequent British anachronisms that any half-decent editor could have fixed. I won't even get started on the cringe-worthy nature of the dialogue itself. These characters read like teenagers, or at least how a middle aged woman imagines teenagers speak, which is worrying given they're all supposed to be in their twenties, but not surprising given that this is Twilight fan-fiction. A brief side note for the less internet savvy Members of Parliament present today. Fan-fiction are stories written by fans of an original work. Sometimes they're based on movies, songs, or in this instances books. And sometimes they're based on real people, known as RPF. During my research I uncovered a significant amount of RPF relating to me and various people of political interest. What can I say? What has been seen cannot be unseen: Returning back to the matter in hand, the juvenile nature of the prose only serves to highlight just how ridiculous the content of the novel is. The characters are clearly Edward and Bella (don't ask me how I know this, I'm a Desperate Housewives fan so my taste in popular culture is suspect at best) with no editing or creative spin put on them to differentiate them from fan-fiction state to original fiction state. They're bland, predictable and entirely stupid. Mr Speaker, the so-called hero of this piece, Christian Grey, is nothing short of an abusive spouse, masquerading as a sexual dominant. He pushes Ana into a situation she has no real understanding of and never provides her with any real information on what she's been forced into. Once again, we're left with a nasty little man considered charming and desirable based solely on his looks, although I imagine his extreme wealth also has something to do with that. He's condescending, mean, classless, he stalks her and puts her in situations she clearly says she's uncomfortable with. How is it romantic or sexy to intimidate your girlfriend and have her constantly worry about upsetting you for fear of your twitchy palm? That's shocking, Mr Speaker! Shocking! The hastily developed romance is not romance and it's more embarrassingly hilarious than sexy. This author has absolutely no understanding of what a dominant/submissive relationship entails. Christian's abhorrent behaviour is excused as a normal part of BDSM and D/S relations, which stem from his childhood trauma. Because, of course, only messed up people would ever want to mix pain with pleasure. This cheap, lazy mis-characterisation of an issue the author clearly knows less about than her readers only does a disservice to romance readers, real D/S relationships, and women full stop. It's bad enough that our society is sex obsessed without ever really discussing it, but surely women deserve better porn than this? I know my shadow Chancellor agrees with me. It's not even that kinky! It's a sad sign of just how sexually conservative this world is when a little spanking is considered hardcore BDSM. Then again, the spanking in this book is rage inducing in how badly it gets D/S relations wrong. Threatening the heroine is not how it works! At one point in the novel, Christian says, and I quote, \"I could threaten you.\" Mr Speaker, how is this acceptable? The author doesn't know what she's doing! The only time this could legitimately enters the realm of kink is when Christian yanks out Ana's tampon and proceeds to have sex with her while she's menstruating. Not my cup of tea, I must admit. However, the scene is so badly written, so immature in its 1st person narration of the scene from Ana's point of view, that the only natural reaction is to laugh, cry or enter a perpetual state of panda-faced bemusement: Now, I won't go into further details on that area here in the interests of parliamentary politeness, but rest assured that many more qualified people than I have discussed this matter at length. Maybe the Chancellor can help us out there again, yes? Lashed to the mast, yes, Mr Chancellor? Mr Speaker, nothing in this book rings true. It's lacking in tension, in strong characterisation, in decent prose, in readable dialogue, in consistency and in pacing. It's evident that this work is fan-fiction because it reads like fan-fiction, not only in content but in style. It reads like it was supposed to be read on a chapter-by-chapter basis the way fan-fiction is designed. There's no finesse to the text. I highly doubt its publishers, The Writer's Coffee Shop, bothered to properly edit it before churning out overpriced copies to be sold online. A simple search-and-replace on names seems to have been the maximum work done to the text, as evidenced by Dear Author's comparison between the book and the original fan-fiction, available on their site. Mr Speaker, I can't help but feel exasperated by this self satisfied smug complacency by James and TWCS. It's not hard to see why readers are angry. Not only because of the more than suspect background to the story's origins and subsequent publication as well as the author's own behaviour. Not only because of the 7 figure publishing deal, the placement on the New York Times Bestseller list, and the rumours of a movie adaptation, something that could rival The Room in terms of midnight showing hilarity. Not only because of the mainstream media's complete lack of understanding on issues of fandom, romance novels, erotica and women's sexuality. Not only all of that, Mr Speaker. Readers have the right to be angry because this book is just plain bad. There is so much wrong with this book that just one Miliband cannot express it: Mr Speaker, action must be taken, and I doubt it will come from this complacent Prime Minister. We need strong, informed and occasionally sarcastic action against this surge of pull-to-publish fan-fiction that threatens to fill the market. If not, we will find that we have dug ourselves into a hole that will be impossible to escape, as demonstrated by my shadow Chancellor: A hole where creative copyright is diluted time and time again for profit, bypassing the copyright laws the way the cabinet evades the tax laws, never technically illegal but still morally suspect. Mr Speaker, where will it end? 50 Shades of Grey fan-fiction already exists - surely the Inception of fan-fiction - and what's to stop someone from taking that, changing the names and submitting it to TWCS or Omnific for publication? The media's lack of understanding of fandom can only hinder the discussions we truly need on this matter, so let us demand them and let us demand action! But the question is, will anything ever truly be done? Mr Speaker, I am sad to say that I doubt it will. Profit before creativity, money before ideas. The same old story from the same old Tories... I mean industry. Same difference. We await further developments of this case eagerly. Now, this is the first book in a trilogy, one that ends on a highly predictable cliffhanger, and I've been asked if I will read the other two. My answer is a short one: Mr Speaker I yield the floor. I'm going to go look for that fan-fiction where I'm a vampire and I get to feed on bankers! ...more 6th time reading and I still LOVE it! Can't wait for the movie <3 I love the Fifty Shades trilogy! I've read this book so many times and each time I enjoy it as much as the last. It's one of those books that doesn't really need a review.

To have good sex, a girl has to start out not wanting it. Women have to teach men how to be human. If that\u2019s not what it is, then maybe this book is an outline of a fairy tale and the sex scenes are what people are really looking at. Poor girl is asleep; rich prince is an asshole; they kiss and it wakes her up and turns him nice. We\u2019re so used to the story that we don't need to hear any actual story again, but a shorthand is enough to awaken all of the comforting memories of being taught that if we stay with our abuser, he will change. It\u2019s like this Jack Handy Deep Thought: \u201cI remember the first time I ever saw a shooting star I said, \u2018What the hell is that?\u2019 But nowadays when I see one I just say, \u2018What is that?\u2019 I leave off the \u2018hell\u2019 part. Maybe when I'm old I'll just say, \u2018Whazzit?\u2019\u201d Fifty Shades of Grey is the \u201cWhazzit?\u201d in a long line of stories about girls learning to be brainless to please their abusers. So, maybe the Whazzit story has become so common that it is a neutral color and a reader who enjoyed this book would really be focusing on the sex scenes. But, then, is the sex really worth focusing on here? It uses the annoying euphemisms of typical romance novels and still manages to be even more prudish than usual about descriptions. I hate the \u201capex of my thighs\u201d business, but that\u2019s common enough. But, \u201che touched me There \u201d??? That is just dumb. Another reader pointed out to me that if you search for the word \"cock\" in this book, it is never used to refer to a penis, but used about forty times to describe someone \"cocking\" their heads. It is used so much, and so oddly, that Ana even comments on all the head cocking that goes on. Not a super sexy use of a cock. Also, the sex scenes are very logistically difficult to follow, which does not make for hotness in my book. I had no idea what happened during the one with the plastic tie. She somehow hooked her wrists on a bed post? Was she suspended away from the bed post? So confused. But, the weirdest one to me was the first bathtub scene. So, they\u2019re in the bathtub, and she gives him the A+ blowjob, wherein we learn that she has no gag reflex. But . . . how much water was in the bathtub? How did this actually happen? Did they just have a couple of inches of water in the tub? That doesn\u2019t sound very relaxing. If they had a normal amount of water, did she have to do an underwater bj? Did he have to float while she gave him the bj? Did he sit on the side of the tub??? If I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on, how am I supposed to consider whether it\u2019s hot or not? Even aside from being confused by the sex scenes, for me, most of this story was strikingly repelling. And I\u2019m talking, like, I think even Pleasuring the Pirate was hotter. I imagine this can\u2019t be true, but it\u2019s possible that this book hits every turn off for me: (1) \u201cBaby.\u201d Don\u2019t ever call me a baby, unless I am actually being a baby. Also, never say \u201claters\u201d before you say \u201cbaby.\u201d The words \u201claters\u201d and \u201cbaby\u201d should never be used individually, and certainly not in the same sentence. Also, never say that like a million times and then discuss how original it is to say it. That makes me puke. (2) Stick insects. Christian Grey appears to be some sort of stick insect with freakishly long tentacle fingers. I am not attracted to stick insects. (3) Contracts. Not hot. (4) Bossiness. I loathe bossiness. Why can\u2019t people just do what they want to do, and also avoid being jerks? Why push everyone around? Unattractive. (4) Boring snobbery. I just can\u2019t abide it. It makes my skin crawl. If you want to be a snob, be a snob about something interesting, not wine and classical music and cars. Be a snob about stage makeup or teacups, or something. I don't know what. Be a snob about your own thing. Why is it cool to be a snob about boring things and nerdy to be a snob about something different? Wine/opera/cars snobbery is so expected. Plus, wine snobbery is impossible to listen to. I like wine, don\u2019t get me wrong, but when people turn their nose up and start to talk vintages in a fake British accent, it is obnoxiously ridiculous. This didn\u2019t actually do that, I imagine because James might ultimately know very little about wine, but it gestured at it as though she wished she could talk bouquets and oaks and vintages. Those are the turn offs I can think of now, but I\u2019m sure there are more. Oh, sitting in a bathtub of menstrual blood is, it turns out, a turn off for me. I knew about the tampon scene, and whipping a tampon out to have sex does not freak me out the way it seems to freak some people. One of my friends got totally freaked out by a part where something similar (though more clearly and eloquently, and also maybe a little more creepily, described) happens in The English Patient , and I remember finding it a little haunting and creepy, but sort of beautiful, there. BUT THEN, in Fifty Shades, SHE DOESN\u2019T PUT A TAMPON BACK IN!! And they go and hang out in the bathtub for a little while. So, that\u2019s disgusting and unnecessary. I am not in favor of hanging out in pools of things that come out of my body. Turn off. Oh, seeing life through the POV of an anorexic \u2013 turn off. Locality annoyance: say, \u201cI-5.\u201d \u201cThe Interstate 5\u201d? Please. I\u2019m not even going to talk about the subconscious and inner goddess because that is just facially crazy talk. And annoying. Also: The only good thing about this experience was that it allowed me to vent my anger as above, with my Christian Grey Ryan Gosling tumblr . Setting aside all of the distracting writing and the way my personal lady parts shrivel up and hide at all the details of this story, it really is the fact the relationship here that is the worst thing. People have talked this to death, but much of the sex and violence Ana experiences are sex and violence she acquiesces to because she\u2019s too scared to lose a boy, not sex and violence she asks for because she wants them. That is very, very annoying to read about. It\u2019s like listening to a nauseatingly long restraining order hearing while knowing the whole time that it won\u2019t be granted. If you want to sacrifice your life with the hope that a man will change, it\u2019s your life. But, don\u2019t whine to me about your stupid choices. Every single part of this book was terrible. ...more", "Title": "Fifty Shades of Grey"},
