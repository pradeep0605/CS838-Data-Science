{"Comments": "I was irritated early on by the way this book was written. I think it encompasses all my other grips about the book. Basically the situation is like this: a woman journalist is in Kabul after 9/11. She meets this bookseller, lives with his family a few months with only 3 people in the family speaking English and then she writes a book about them.

Basically the situation is like this: a woman journalist is in Kabul after 9/11. She meets this bookseller, lives with his family a few months with only 3 people in the family speaking English and then she writes a book about them. First of all, having lived abroad and lived abroad with families, you can't know a family the way this author pretends to in that time. We don't even know how she interacted with the family because she writes herself out of the book entirely. She somehow thinks that she hasn't effected the family's life and that she can just describe them as if there is not some strange white woman sitting on the floor taking notes as they live their lives. The book is written with such heavy condescension that I wanted to throw up. The moral I took away from the book is that life in Afghanistan sucks,<---M> especially if you are a woman</---M>, and it's all due to their stupid culture. Warning, this is not what I think, this is what I think the author was telling me to think. The author says in the preface that she was inspired by this family. But from how she wrote the book it seems she was disgusted. I don't understand how she can write that way without even writing herself in, therefore allowing the follies of inter cultural miscommunication and misunderstanding play a part. ...more After finishing the book, I was quite surprised at the number of negative reviews here in Goodreads.

Maybe a huge culture shock is at play here. Many in the West may be put off by the realization that the values that they take for granted may be totally unheard of in certain parts of the world. There *are* certain cultures where children are nothing but tools for parents and as such, are actively denied education. There *are* cultures where falling in love is a greater \"crime\" than sawing off a person's head. I know for a fact that people in my culture have gotten used to murders and negligence of human rights, but if a couple were caught kissing in public, as it were the very fabric of society would be shred to smithereens. There *are* societies where women are nothing more than baby-making and house-keeping machines, commodities which are to be sold off in the financial ritual of marriage. Since I grew up in a culture not vastly different from the one portrayed in this book, I find it hard to dismiss this account as prejudiced hogwash. That, and I also steer clear of any sort of cultural relativism. I know for a fact that no one in the comparatively progressive world would want to be a woman in Afghan society after reading this book, even more so after living in the country for some time by himself/herself. The author may not have captured Afghan culture in its entirety(<---B>and no where has she made that claim</---B>), but she has been anything but prejudiced. For me, the pathos in this book lies in the hopes and aspirations of the members of the Khan family living in a post-Taliban Afghanistan. The women want education and a job, the children want to play, young men and women of the country want to fall in love in spite of knowing the dire consequences, and Sultan Khan wants to contribute towards building a better and liberal Afghanistan, a country which he can boast of to the world. This book draws a very humane picture of an obscure society, a picture that very often fails to filter through the coloured glasses of mainstream media. ...more Loved it! Not long back from Pakistan and it was the perfect time to read this.<---F> Love learning about the culture</---F>. Some of the stories we're savage. Enter the world of the Norwegian journalist, <---A>\u00c5sne Seierstad</---A>, who covers the aftermath of the Taliban on society in Afghanistan, and you get what you could expect, but still hope you're wrong: a 'pseudo-novelistic' attempt at exposing the life of a country in turmoil / vicious power struggles / chaos.

Coming from a liberal Norwegian society, and being a young journalist, it is expected that the book will be written from a pessimistic, typical journalistic point of view. In fact, I struggled to get into this 'novel' - for nothing in the book presented any characteristics expected of a novel. There was no story line at all to begin with. No plot, no highs and lows, no lyrical prose, no good or bad, no character building - NOTHING. But it was a best seller. Ya well no fine! It was obviously a best seller for reasons beyond my understanding, but as a novel, or well-written one? - nope, sorry. The question remains though: WHY was it promoted and sold as a novel? It is an expanded set of articles(dare it be called essays?) which became long enough to fill up a book. It wasn't a story. It was a bundle of interviews with all the characters blanketed by a liberal, inexperienced viewpoint from observing filth, poverty, oppression, cruelty, and whatever adjectives or synonyms for it could be found in a journalist's vocabulary. Neither the male, nor the female interviewees were good people, according to the interpretation of their family life by the author. Bottom line: the journalist was disgusted with the whole set-up and pushed it down my throat with my consent. After all, I wanted to finish the book, right!? In retrospect I am more annoyed with myself for wasting valuable time and energy in allowing it to happen! Compared to \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" written by Khaled Hosseini, this was a memoir, an optimistic attempt by a writer to cross the bridge between being an investigative journalist to novelist and just not succeeding very well. It is not a type of biography either, and not even remotely on par with a real novelist such as Hosseini, who wrote from within his own community to start off with. But okay, so it wasn't a novel, so let me at least credit the author for her effort: It is an in-depth look at the typical Afghan family experiencing and surviving different occupations of their country. The fact that she stayed three months with Sultan, the book seller, and his extended family, allowed her insight into their lives that is not showered upon many westerners. Although she is not present in the book, the situation is presented from her viewpoint. It is splashed all over the book. Her observations are detailed. The book highlights the effect of suppression on human lives. In this case, freedom of choice for the men, mostly,was taken away first by the Communists, then Mujahedeen and lastly the Taliban. Women never had any freedom neither choice anyway. The impact on the people is enormous as far as restructuring their lives is concerned. And then 9/11 happened and the Americans came. But if I really want to know what is happening now, I will have to consult the internet and the Al Jazeera news channel. It will be an extension of this book. An investigative journalistic report. I did endure until the last full stop. So you wonder how the book ends? Well, what do you expect?! It is always a matter of choice if you want to find out. Expectations differ from person to person, after all. I will respect your point of view no matter what. I apologize for pushing my annoyance down your throat in case you have opted to read to this point ;-) ...more I think I learned more from this one book than from any news story or other examination of Afghanistan. You think, after reading the forward and the beginning of the book, that the bookseller will be a progressive man, but his love for his country's history and its literary heritage is his only redeeming quality and yet the very reason he is such a bastard toward his family.

You think, after reading the forward and the beginning of the book, that the bookseller will be a progressive man, but his love for his country's history and its literary heritage is his only redeeming quality and yet the very reason he is such a bastard toward his family. Everything comes second to his passion. In the wake of the Taliban's withdrawal we see them slowly try to regain their freedoms, but after years of outside oppression, the feeling has slowly sunk inward. Sultan's sister is too repressed to speak up in her own defense. His sons do not speak up against their father's wishes which prevent them from having a decent childhood as they slave away in his shops. And his own wife, once a respected professor, must bow to the will of her firstborn who says he does not want to work, even though it is her only desire. There are glimmers of hope along the way as fate does give the women, who become the true stars of this book a chance. And there are some wiser people amongst the Khan family who have figured out what the country truly needs and that peace is dependent upon throwing off the desire for power that has caused so much war in the country. Ironically, at one point in the book, a hotel guard in the worst territory in Afghanistan, observing one of Khan's family members helping an American journalist operate a satellite phone, the likes of which the hotel guard has never seen, says \"Do you know what our problem is? We know everything about our weapons but we know nothing about how to use a telephone.\" Lack of communication seems to be the greatest obstacle in the book and the one that holds the country back. Hopefully that will soon change. But in the meantime, if you really want to get a glimpse into true Afghan life, buy this book. ...more Valerie - I found a used copy of this book for your Christmas present (since I raved about it to you) so don't go buying it! :-) I wasn't going to write a review of this book at all until I read some of the other reviews posted here and became horrified at their castigation of Ms. Seierstad.

A rebuttal: I liked this book BECAUSE it doesn't read like investigative journalism. Seirstad never once pretends that she's being unbiased and doesn't apologize for the obvious slant. Frankly, her slant is what I believe mine would be, as I can't deal with overbearing ANYBODY deciding what's best for me or telling me how I must live. What impressed me the most was her willingness as a naive Western woman to go off by herself and live in an Afghan family, which is something I could never do. Living in a family of religious extremists (of any stripe) is not the same as living as an exchange student. Her experience doing so is her experience - sorry it wasn't pretty. The fact is, she lived in Afghanistan and managed not to get killed, raped, sold, or go stark raving mad. She is living proof that Western women can survive in Afghanistan. As for her book \"feeling hopeless\" - perhaps that's because she didn't see any hope. Thinking that world peace is possible (it's not) and that every bad situation will eventually work out (they don't all) to make butterflies and rainbows is a serious failing of American \"investigative\" journalism. Folks who think and write that way should take a lesson from George Orwell and Upton Sinclair. If you want a hope-filled answer then create one, but don't despise the woman for pointing out that a bad situation is a bad situation. Oh, and have you read \"Not Without My Daughter\"? ...more my issues with this book are basically ideological/political -- in spite of an introduction justifying her decision to erase herself from the

(view spoiler) [It is odd really that the USA ended up raining bombs on the Taliban. There's a common current between some political persuasions in the USA and the Taliban, both really dislike women having pre-martial sex, both are strongly inspired by the Bible and want to see religion at the heart of their national cultures, both believe in saying no to drugs, yet perhaps when it came down to it the Americans were just too jealous of the Taliban's free and easy gun culture. But that's the nature of war, to make strange allies and stranger enemies. (hide spoiler) ] Seierstad lived in his home with his extended family - his mother, two wives, a sister, children of various ages. The home was a flat in a Soviet built block in Kabul. Running water and electricity casualties of the on and off warfare going on since the 1970s. Seierstad calls the bookseller Sultan. He was an ambitious and energetic man, or depending on your perspective - simply an overbearing patriarch. He had been to school, studied engineering at university, while there had fallen into the booktrade supplying his fellow students with textbooks. While Seierstad was his guest he had three bookshops doing a roaring trade in selling postcards to coalition soldiers, a confectionery concession in a lifeless hotel, and was bidding for the textbook contract for the whole of Afghanistan - here he ended up loosing out to the University of Oxford. The business were staffed by his sons, none of whom he sent to school. Sultan, his sister Leila, and his son Mansur were the only people who spoke English. Seierstad in her introduction admits that she didn't master Dari so there is a difference between this book and One Hundred and One Days . There everything she describes she either saw herself or is related by other journalists she spoke to. Here her presence is elusive in the text. She tells us that she was present on certain occasions (view spoiler) [ the visit with Mansur to Mazar-i-Sharif, at the bathhouse, the visits to the central police station and the ministry of Education, the road trip with American journalist 'Bob' and his interpreter to find Osama Bin Ladin (view spoiler) [they don't (hide spoiler) ] (hide spoiler) ] in the introduction, for the rest we are in a grey zone of stories related and potentially misunderstood in translation between members of the family and Seierstad. Luckily for us, perhaps, some of the potential uncertainty is removed by a court case launched by Sultan second, and much younger wife, in 2010 against Seierstad. The grounds of her complaint was not that Seierstad's account was inaccurate, but rather that she had unfairly shared her private thoughts and opinions with a wider public. Eventually in 2013 a court decided that this was what journalists are entitled to do. Anyroad, and I am sorry if this is a gross spoiler for you, Afghanistan, it turns out, was not a happy place. Leila has a plan to become an English teacher, to which end the responsible Minister is duly and appropriately bribed to sign the relevant paperwork unfortunately because the ministers spend large parts of the day signing the papers of people who have bribed their way in, their signatures become progressively less valuable (p269), so by the end of the book she hasn't managed to make it to the front of a classroom and get chalk on her fingers. A carpenter hired to build sloping bookshelves for one of the shops is repeatedly beaten for stealing some of those valuable postcards by his elderly father. Eventually having confessed that he stole them for one of Sultan's rivals he gets a few years in prison. \"Don't forget, under the Taliban he would have had his hand cut off,\" the chief constable emphasises (p226) the modern Afghan police, happily, is all about community policing \"Once we surprised a couple in a car. We, or rather the parents, forced them to marry,\" he says. \"That was fair, don't you think? After all, we're not the Taliban...we must try to avoid stoning people. The Afghans have suffered enough\" (p228). Luckily for Seierstad she manages to travel in a car on separate occasions with 'Bob' and Mansur (view spoiler) [ this is the journey to Mazar-i-Sharif when she sees the remains of Soviet tanks destroyed by Mujahadeen who had swarmed down the mountainside like goats (hide spoiler) ] without getting stopped by the police and obliged to marry. Partly maybe because when with 'Bob' they are in a region were homosexually is all the rage among the warlord's army, but I'm anticipating myself with my comparisons with ancient Greece, let me make you wait until the next paragraph, here major jealous dramas develop around the young men; many blood feuds have been fought over a young lover who divided his favours between two men. On one occasion two commanders launched a tank battle in the bazaar in a feud over a young lover. The result was several dozen killed (p250). It was Leila in her burka pausing to hire an urchin to accompany her to the market as a chaperone that put me in mind of the well to do ladies of ancient Athens. Seierstad says that the burka was only introduced in the 20th century to Kabul by one of the Kings of Afghanistan who decreed that the 200 women of his harem should each wear one when ever they left the palace to wander about town. No-one wanted to be seen as any less than one of the women of the King's harem and so the practice of wearing a small tent with a small grill to see out of trickled down from the uppermost social class over time to very lowest. The world of the burka, Seierstad tell us, is a smelly one, with restricted vision an added bonus. No sooner have the women of the household - The whole Khan family are on the plump side, certainly compared to Afghan standards. The fat and the cooking oil they pour over their food are manifested on their bodies (p163), swabbed themselves down in the municipal bathhouse in it is back inside their old clothes. The women are spotlessly clean under the burkas and the clothes, but the soft soap and the pink shampoo desperately fight against heavy odds. The women's own smell is soon restored; the burkas force it down over them (p168), as they walk along the dry and dusty streets. It is a closed and cautious country in which marriage negotiations are conducted by a man's nearest female relative - except in cases of utmost need, and in which the brides family can be expected to say no on the first attempt merely as a matter of form anything else would be to sell short to this rich unknown suitor whom Sultan recommended so warmly. It would not do to appear too keen. But they knew Sultan would return; Sonya was young and beautiful (p13). One mustn't appear too eager after-all. History is a constant theme (view spoiler) [ not that Seierstad is herself a good example, early on writing that the British invaded India from the north via the Khyber Pass, no doubt they would have done if they could, however geography intervened to make that an impractical proposition (hide spoiler) ] , Leila declaring that she will not wear a burka again once the king has returned, the ignorance of the people of their own past, leaving us to wonder quite what can be rebuilt, it is a more absolute year zero than we can imagine. Outside Kabul war continues in different forms, while within the coalition soldiers are a source of ready income. A world in which a Matriarch orders her sons to smother her daughter for the sake of the families honour and in which Mansur's work colleague offers a beggar girl money for sex - provided she has a wash first (view spoiler) [ witnessing this incident is the impetus for Mansur to visit Mazar-i-Sharif and get spiritually cleansed (hide spoiler) ] , a man must have a code it seems, however twisted. Seierstad, although she is often humorous in tone (view spoiler) [ unless this is down to the translation (hide spoiler) ] , doesn't seem to have much enjoyed her time with the bookseller of Kabul. Which is not surprising. Living in a small flat with a large family, all traumatised in different ways by the experience of war and exile in Pakistan - occasionally dreaming of the bright lights of Tehran - while obliged to wear a burka when out on the streets is not an easy experience for an outsider. The stories she tells are claustrophobic. The social releases limited to quail fighting and watching buzkashi fights - something rather like polo, except with a headless calf rather than a ball. ...more It being Banned Books Week when I began this book,\u00a0 I don't think I could have chosen a more appropriate book to read than <+++>The Bookseller of Kabul</+++>.\u00a0 The book was banned in 2008 by the Wyandotte, Michigan, Board\u00a0 of Education; it tells of actual instances of banning and burning books in Afghanistan; and the main character Sultan Khan was a bookseller who himself specialized in selling illegal books and writings, often right under the noses of the illiterate Taliban a-holes.\u00a0 Learning that most Ta It being Banned Books Week when I began this book,\u00a0 I don't think I could have chosen a more appropriate book to read than <+++>The Bookseller of Kabul</+++>.\u00a0 The book was banned in 2008 by the Wyandotte, Michigan, Board\u00a0 of Education; it tells of actual instances of banning and burning books in Afghanistan; and the main character Sultan Khan was a bookseller who himself specialized in selling illegal books and writings, often right under the noses of the illiterate Taliban a-holes.\u00a0 Learning that most Taliban cannot read, which presumably means not\u00a0even their Koran, explains quite a lot!

It was interesting and page-turning, but the author's tone really aggravated me. She spoke sardonically of situations that held little humour. Also, she assumed a sort of deep knowledge of her subjects and largely oversimplified the context in which the Khan family lived. She started to speak in like a personal third person, as if she understood deeply the characters' thoughts. I do not believe she had this understanding and therefore do not think she should have conveyed it as such. It is trespassing; even the best journalist/reporters cannot assume the character's inner beliefs and feelings. She presupposes a lot. Living with a family for a few months and only interacting with the three English-speaking members of the family does not merit her sweeping generalizations. Granted, she makes a disclaimer that the Khan family does not represent all Afghanis. She has an obvious oversight with regard to her generalizing her own observations to proclaim so much about the family. Not only does she entirely write herself out of the story, which completely limits the reader's ability to validate whether or not her interactions yielded this much understanding about the family, but she disregards the fact that many of her observations might be from an oblique angle and that her presence itself undoubtedly must have affected the family. Her observations are without citation, in that sense, because she does not give her analysis any supporting framework or context. It also lacked a central theme or a point. After reading it, I can't say there was some message she got across to me, just a series of loosely related anecdotes. No real declaration, but there were some beautiful nuances. Other than that, no real thesis. Pros: she described characters beautifully. It was surprising how you could at once hate and love a character, know nothing about them and then second guess yourself and find yourself completely enthralled in their identities. She talked about real people and she made them real in her pages with her intimate detailing of idiosyncratic observations. You got a sense of the reality of her characters in their interactions. I couldn't quite tell if she translated the characters' stories with love or contempt, but I guess it doesn't really matter in the end, because it's the reader. And I guess as a reader I loved them and hated them so...hey. The book was really despondent. There wasn't anything really hopeful about it, and any hope I could manage to find, the author emphatically dashed. I think she was actively propagating that Afghanistan was a place with no hope of improving and that it stagnated in archaic traditions and had no way out. Most exposes will at least bestow a sense of felicity upon the reader in the form of some meager optimism, but this author was not that geneous. In this way, I disagree with her portrayal. Albeit it being a nonfiction, and although she can't embellish with happy moments, her narrations of anything good were few and far between. I think that even in the worst of scenarios, which the Khan family did not represent, there could be some light shed, but she just made the whole story dismal and lacking any connection to a future ambition for the country, like she was just telling a tragedy and leaving. I guess I'm happy I read it. I guess I kinda liked it--but somewhat grudgingly. ...more The most depressing book about the area that I have read.

The authority changed from Afghans to communists to Taliban, but the persecutions remained the same; imprisonment, arrest, beatings and regular interrogation. He suffered watching illiterate Taliban thugs burn piles of his books in the streets of Kabul, so he hid them. His collection and stock was secreted across attics and rooms across the capital. Whilst he abhorred censorship and was passionate about all things literary he was also an Afghan man. He had strict and immovable views on family life, the role of women in society and the home and how he treated people and expected them to treat him with due deference. It is into this family that Seierstad comes. In her unique position as a Western woman, she is able to move between the two hemispheres of male and female life in the home and the city, something that no male journalist would have been able to achieve. It is a time of huge change too, she arrived in 2002, just after the Taliban had be routed by the Americans, and whilst society had thrown of some of the shackles, many cultural norms still remained. In this she takes a step back and lets the Khans speak for themselves, and you see a very private life inside an Afghan family. It is not the easiest book to read, not because it isn\u2019t well written and translated, but because the society and culture that she describes is so very different to ours. It is brutal at times, heavily restricting women in what they can do, say and achieve in society, as well as having tribal fighting, harsh justice, precious little infrastructure and at times no hope. They have decades of oppression there and to make steps towards a society that has those opportunities that we take for granted will take many years and need deep fundamental changes to political and culture to bring it about. I had hoped that it would be more about the perils of the book business there, and whilst it made for a fascinating account, didn\u2019t live up to what I had hoped for. ...more

He has many book stores and he believes that everyone should have access to books but never sent his kids to school. He wants women to be independent but doesn't let his sister work and earn. This book shows the lives of different members in his family and how they are dependent on him. His decision is something no one would ever oppose and will obey even when they see that he is wrong because he is the one who wants people to be free but wants he family be dependent on him. \" I laugh with my mouth, not my heart.\" My favorite character was Leila as she was only one who actually want to be truly free and out of the cage. The book closely shows the culture and tradition of the country and how it slowly changed for women and children after years of trying. I really loved the epilogue where the author questions about other families' freedom and gives something to ponder over. Really love this book.

I am not sure I like the way the story reads, In spring 2002 award winning journalist Asne Seiratad spent four months living with the bookseller and his family but while the story is told by Seierstad about the Khan family she does not appear in the book and I found this off putting as sometimes I felt I was reading a novel as I can\u2019t believe that the characters especially the Afghan men would discuss or trust a western female journalist. Throughout the book I was waiting for something to happen or for conclusions to individual stories and I know this was my expectations so therefore perhaps this is the reason that I found the book lacking. I did find the historical content of the book really interesting and felt such sadness for some of the characters especially the women who are treated so badly and have no control over their futures, I found the power fathers, husbands, brothers and sons have over their wives mothers, sisters and daughters so disturbing that I found it difficult reading as I wanted these women to triumph over these self obsessed men but that I am afraid this would not be true in the society they live in.

Still the passages about the destruction of libraries and museums is enough to break your heart. I don't understand the \"logic\" of the Nazis and the Taliban in the burning of books but I guess it cuts down on people having different viewpoints. Sultan, the lead character, is not very likable although he has some admirable traits. His preservation of old books is admirable. As I read though, I discovered many of the traits I disliked were a product of his experiences and upbringing. If I had been through as many wars, imprisonments and beatings maybe I would make some of his decisions. It's hard to know. Of course, the tragedy of the women is heartbreaking. Their demeaning roles and lack of any type of freedom is horrific. I do not know where some of these sects get the idea that this is the way Mohammed would like them treated. Mohammed's wife, Fatima, was an educated businesswoman and I am sure he didn't treat her that way. Of course, many Christian sects due this to women too and there is nothing in the Bible that says Jesus advocates that type of behavior. I just found this an average book that really didn't explore any new territory for me. ...more In keeping in line with my Afghanistan kick, I discovered this book online and got it from the library.

But even though they are more privileged than most in Afghanistan, they still face hard times. Dealing with the Taliban who banned all books and anything art or culture related...this father was actually imprisoned at times. Its just so sad to me how this country was destroyed by the Taliban. Not that the war with Russia was good, but the Taliban destroyed museums and artifacts. Thousands of years of history and culture...decimated within months. You can't replace that stuff. ...more A hard book to take and I did find some of the angles covered a tad bit implausible, from an investigative POV. Who in their right mind is going to tell this white western woman okayed by Sultan anything as disparate (and desperate) as their feelings about him. Yes, I am a little suspect of Seierstad's methods here but there is no doubt that the behaviours exposed are pretty true to life in Afghanistan at the moment. For more than twenty years, Sultan Khan has defied the authorities, whether communist or Taliban, to supply books to the people of Kabul. He has been arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned, and has watched illiterate Taliban soldiers burn piles of his books in the street. Yet he has persisted in his passion for books, shedding light in one of the world's darkest places.

He has been arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned, and has watched illiterate Taliban soldiers burn piles of his books in the street. Yet he has persisted in his passion for books, shedding light in one of the world's darkest places. This is the intimate portrait of a man of principle and of his family - two wives, five children, and many relatives sharing a small four-room apartment in this war-ravaged city. As they endure the extraordinary trials and tensions of Afghanistan's upheavals, they also still try to live ordinary lives, with work, relaxation, shopping, cooking, marriages, rivalries, and shared joys. Most of all, this is an intimate portrait of family life under Islam. Even after the Taliban's collapse, the women in Khan's family must submit to arranged marriages, polygamous husbands, and crippling limitations on their ability to travel, learn, and communicate with others. Seierstad lived with Khan's family for months, experiencing first-hand Afghani life as few outsiders have seen it. Stepping back from the page, she allows the Khans to speak for themselves, giving us a genuinely gripping and moving portrait of a family, and of a country of great cultural riches and extreme contradictions. I have somewhat ambivalent feelings towards this book. Although the title led me to believe I was going to read about a bookseller the truth is that very little if any part of the story is dedicated to that. Sultan Khan is a bookseller but he could have any other job that for the story it would be just the same. Then I was interested in learning about a different culture and a different country but if things are just as Seierstad presents them with civil and human rights being denied even amongst family members I think this is a reality truly too difficult to contemplate. Women are nothing and are mostly treated as slaves or objects and even the men in the family have to obey blindly to the head of the family or break off with him and leave the house. The head of the family is Sultan Khan for whom I ended having a strong dislike. I can accept and understand different ways and a different culture but it seemed to me Sultan Khan was the only content person, everyone else disliked the situation they were in and how they were expected to live their lifes. I think she could have used a different perspective when telling the story, this way I ended up not knowing why certain traditions are important and I think they are presented in a less than favourable light. The author mentions she spent 3 months with the family to write this book. I would have been interested in knowing how she dealt with such a different reality from what is certainly used to and how did the family, in particular the women, reacted to her what she certainly has told them about life in Europe. None of that appears in the book as the author totally removed herself of the story... Grade: C ...more Another non-fiction from the gothic Afghanistan which will pierce your heart.

A country which is war torn by more than 30 years of war and is finally trying to rebuild itself but is constantly threatened by the dogma of internal dissidents and the ambiguities of its own citizens- who are thrown in between the complex fabric of a phase where they are happy to be free, still decide to cling to the age old traditions. The story revolves around a bookseller who is actually a liberal in his thoughts, but an authoritarian at his home, and the various male and female members of his family. The Norwegian author had actually lived among the family in their house, and hence her account of it, comes to be more lively than surreal. An easy and quick read, but is mentally invigorating enough to linger in your mind for a while. ...more A factual account written in a fictional way. This made for a very good read. I read this book after I had read The Kite Runner and Reading Lolita in Tehran. It enhanced my knowledge of the difficulties of living in a restrictive culture. Hats off to Afghan women. It was heartbreaking to read of their slavery and oppression, the way society treats them, the way they have to live without hope or expectations, how basic necessities like education and wealth are denied to them, how they are married off (or literally sold off to the highest bidder) to men decades older than them, sometimes as third or fourth wives and how they are physically abused and punished if they even look at another man.

I used to think dowry system in India was is foulest on earth, but then the opposite is not much better. These girls, or rather their male relatives are paid handsome amounts by rich older men who also bear the wedding cost, which on deeper thinking seems to be much degrading. I dont know how much of this book is really true, but if what is portrayed here is the way of life of Afghan women, I wonder how they live day after day, when most people would have embraced death rather than a soulless existence. This is an interesting book revolving around an old bookseller and publisher of Kabul, how he deals with his women relative, younger men relatives and society as a whole. He is portrayed to be much more liberated and kindhearted than the average man. But still, there is much left to desire.

I should have read it earlier, when it was Current Events and might have seemed original. Now it feels like Ancient History. I have also read A Thousand Splendid Suns , to which it shows an uncanny similarity in several parts. ETA: I should have said that ATSS is similar to Bookseller, as Bookseller pre-dates it by several years. A very interesting, journalistic depiction of life in Afghanistan as told from inside the tent of a relatively well-to-do family, with particular attention to the experiences of females. It is compelling reading, and should be mandatory for anyone who wants to know about life in Afghanistan. It is not a good thing to be a female there.<---C>\u00c5sne Seierstad</---C>", "Title": "The Bookseller of Kabul"},
