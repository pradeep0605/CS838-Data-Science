I think Ally Condie owes at least half of her seven-figure paycheck to Lois Lowry . The entire dystopian world is lifted directly from Lowry's The Giver . Almost everything interesting in <+++>Matched</+++> is very familiar - the idea of highly controlled Society (the Community in The Giver ), the prearranged Matches, uniform clothing, the pills suppressing emotions, predetermination of everyone's life course, euthanized elderly, regulated personal possessions, the precision of the language, the family structure.<---F> The list goes on and on</---F>... What Condie adds of her own is too often doesn't make much sense - people are not allowed/can't write, but they know how to read and operate computers; Matches and procreation are controlled but teens can still snog around a bit; and what is the sorting job all about, I still have no idea. I am not the biggest fan of The Giver our there, but that novel had a horrifying, structured, world hiding behind its simplistic language. What hides behind the words of Matched is sheer emptiness. And boredom and unoriginality. If all \"borrowed\" dystopian ideas are stripped away, what is left is a tepid, G-rated teen romance affair with an obligatory love triangle and magical love connections. Even the male love interests are the same old tired cliches - a sweet and loyal best friend type and a mysterious, hurt, emo type quoting poetry. Yawn! Yawn! Yawn! Ally Condie 's writing is serviceable enough. So are the characters. No male character requires a restraining order against him, no female - a head check for putting up with abusive crap. But is this (and a pretty cover) really a recipe for success these days? There is nothing in this novel to get excited over. There is no urgency to Condie's writing, no passion. Just dull characters, dull relationships, dull conflicts, dull conversations... I can't whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone, it simply doesn't offer anything new or noteworthy. But some fans of lukewarm-romance-driven stories like Birthmarked or Beautiful Creatures might enjoy it I suppose. Do I really need to say I am not coming back for more? P.S.

I opened Matched , and snails came at me with their shells and antennae of slime and grime and chime and dime. SNAILS EVERYWHERE. I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe, I was forced to understand things that weren't first explained! It was horrible I tell you! Matched tells the story of <---C>Cassia Reyes</---C>, robot extraordinaire, who lives in this nameless City run by the Society. It has a Hill, an Arboretum, and Outer Provinces, and special 'emergency tablets', but don't worry, they're not dove into right away, so you're supposed to know all about this place right the fuck away . Thankfully, Cassia finds it necessary to tell us about this Matching ceremony that binds people together for life (but teens have flings anyway so how is this Matching accurate?). Then Cassia gets her Match: her bff, Xander Carrow, cool kid, the best of the best. She goes \"Yay!\" But then, a NEW FACE APPEARS! SHIT. It's this kid that she knows named Ky Markham, who's an Aberration, you know, people who's parents got an Infraction and now the kids are screwed too or something. Whatever, forbidden love all around! Take it in folks! But Cassia simply must know why the Society fudged up, and thus says, \"Looks like it's up to ME!\" Let's burn this little suckah down to the GROUND WHERE IT BELONGS : Writing. I will give a nod to Ally Condie for not completely fucking up the style in this book. There was some nice prose, especially with the scenes with Ky and Cassia writing poetry while hiking. OH BUT WAIT, we discuss later in this book that even though these citzens can read and operate computers , they can't write. Someone tells me how that makes sense and I'll give them a cookie or something. Until then, fook that noise. Another point on the writing was the pacing. The snail pace of Matched was the exact reason why I ran to Vladdy Tod, said \"HOLD ME SWEET LORD\", finished it in a day, cried my heart out figuratively, then stumbled back into this mess. There was nothing exciting going on in this book. I'll give a bone to Condie for providing some nice romantic scenes and one scene where I actually had a small sense of grief, but everything else was robotic, plain, and uninteresting. Even good old Robot Jones had more personality than most characters in the beginning of this novel. SPEAKING OF CHARACTERS WHO ARE ROBOTIC, how about that Cassia Reyes? Or hell, the entire Reyes family? Molly and Abran Reyes are just drones to the Society in the beginning. Mr. Reyes gets better later on, and even Cassia does, too. I mean, she even makes strong, good decisions. STUNNING INDEED! Bram was adorable though, I'll give Condie that too. Xander and Ky were the two dudes in this pain-stakingly unnecessary love triangle , but then again, what is YA without one right? It must be some new required rule that I could give less than a fuck about. Moving on, the good thing (the ONLY good thing) is that both of these guys aren't abusive, douchey, lust-filled, or cocky. They are normal guy friends with Cassia and THANK YOU LORD FOR BLESSING ME THAT MUCH. Sadly, the need for this love triangle is never seen to me. I just see that forbidden love nonsense and another boy is hopelessly in the way. Xander teased Cassia in a best friend way, he was nice and smart and tried to live in the Society with no problems. He never wanted anything bad or maddening to happen; he just wanted the ordinary life of being Matched. But no, Cassia couldn't have that. So she sneaks around with Ky. But it's with Ky that she can actually evolve from a robot into a real girl! Ky is a rare catch cause he can write! He likes poetry! I bet he plays guitar and sings songs in the forbidden lands that are mentioned once and never again. Ky is a good character. He's not trying to get Cassia to fall for him, and he has a nice personality. Ms. Robot remained just that all throughout this book except for the times she was with Ky. Ky saved her from my strangles. She should be lucky. But again, when she does develop, she is a good character. She is strong, she does what is right when she has to. And shockingly enough: She's not an idiot! That may take a few seconds to sink in...but I'll wait... . . . . So what blew this up for me? What killed this book? Le structure. There is close to nothing. Structure is nearly dead. It was horrifying and I wished the snails holding me to this book would at least grant me a half-assed story with the somewhat nice characters made by Condie. But no, I was not given that. If there was anything set up correctly in this book I would be alright with things happening the way they were. BUT THERE WAS NO CLIMAX. NOTHING THAT DROVE THIS ENTIRE BOOK OTHER THAN CASSIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH KY. Sure, it was cute, but there has to be a bigger story than romance. This is dystopian, gimme GODDAMN-FUCKING-DYSTOPIAN. This is why I can't handle those fucking triangles. Even a square would be more entertaining for Boba Fett's sake . And the antagonists...where were they? \"The whole Society is the antagonist! Doy! :B\" No no no, I'm talking about that ONE ROADBLOCK that means to drive Cassia into Hell, preferably on a motorcycle HAHAHAHA, I'm not funny. There is that one person who drives to destroy Cassia's hopes and dreams and gigglesnort the hell out of it later. Now that character does exist, but I think Condie had a tough time with names or something. This lady was a single Official, one that bothered the shit out of Cassia. What was her name, you ask? THERE WASN'T ONE. SHE WAS NO NAME. Ol' No Name. How. What. KSJDBfLKJSBDGKLA. She actually has a name. Courtesy of commenter Alejandra, her name was Officer Standler, which is mentioned once and only once. But Who's the real antagonist? The ACTUAL ONE? It's not Cassia vs. the entire fucking Society, is it? Jesus fuck, that doesn't make ANY SENSE. They shouldn't be trusted, I got that, but how can we tell if the Society wants Cassia dead or whatever when we don't even know the head honcho of the Society? Or why there's an Official for EVERY PERSON LIVING. That's like saying there's a soldier for every citizen in the United States. WE DON'T KNOW. WE HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE. CONDIE AIN'T TELLING. Give us a mention or something. I need to know things. Brings me to that anti-climactic ending. Cassia moves on with her life (view spoiler) [to find Ky cause the Officials took him away somewhere and is in trouble lol (hide spoiler) ] . Xander, though he's still upset for Cassia being in love with Ky and NOT in love with him, gives Cassia all these blue tablets that'll help her on her journey. This ending was trying to be cliffhanger-like and whimsical or something, but it just sat on the front porch and farted. It did nothing. The book cut off so hard, I called shenanigans. I wish so hard that a climax would at least exist SOMEWHERE. I just...ugh...I am disappointed in this book because it DID give me hope in some areas, but this it just pooped out. It lost the little bit of steam it had. I don't want to read Crossed, but I do wanna see what happens to Ky, because Ky is the only reason. Ky is the second star in this review. He knows where it's at. I guess I should mention that this entire world isn't even that original. I haven't read it myself, but I heard from enough reviewers that this is strikingly similar to Lois Lowry's The Giver . Fuck you then, Condie, for lack of originality. It sickens me when people just can't THINK of anything themselves!

Maybe that's why.\" I shrug, the credits cut, and we start to watch it. I'm quite enjoying it. The shadows, music and atmosphere are chilly and the acting isn't the worst I've seen. I also enjoy the hot dad*. That helps. It starts to get a bit slow, so I point to the box and titter stupidly. My sister looks at me in disdain. \"What the fuck is it now?\" \"They look like your fingers.\" She slaps my arm and says, \"Watch the damn movie.\" I keep watching and it's still kind of creepy. I'm almost enjoying it. But then we find out about the astral projection, and my eyes begin to inexplicably roll around in my head. My sister sits with her hand over her eyes because she's a sissy. I grab her hand away and she screams, \"NO! Something bad's going to happen!\" Then we see the ultimate demon bad guy and it's supposed to be such a horrifying bit (y'know, where the thing appears behind the hot dad's head) and my sister screams like a coyote, but I'm absolutely dying with laughter because the thing looks exactly like Darth Maul. She punches me and yells, \"Why are you laughing? \" We keep watching and then we find out about the woman in the veil, and then there's some more astral projection BS, and then when we finally see this so-called demon in full flesh the thing looks like the weird goat devil thing from Powerpuff Girls (you know, the thing wearing the pink apron?). Then there's those stupid smiling girls with the tea party and the whistling guy and when the baby's hand comes out of the sock drawer I'm on the floor, howling. My sister's really cheesed that I'm not being all Serious Business about it, but it's pretty clear that she's totally disenchanted with the whole thing. We both start to laugh when Michael Jackson's Thriller backing dancers start to pour out of the airing cupboard and after the completely ridiculous ending with the photograph and the psychic getting her whole head glomped, we have another hearty laugh at the fact that the lady in the veil was played by some dude called Philip. I bet his resume says, \"Played the sPoOkY lady in the veil in that movie that's kind of like Poltergeist but with all the horror genre merit of Krypto the Superdog .\" I should've known when I looked at the box and saw the words, \"from the makers of Paranormal Activity\" that the movie was going to be a colossal waste of time. After about a half hour, the whole thing turned into a less spirited edition of Scooby Doo: Murder In Suburbia! . I went on Facebook and complained about it, and then my other sister said she saw it too at the movies and fell asleep halfway through. She tends to do that. Basically, the Insidious fiasco was a lot like the Matched fiasco. It starts off pretty good and hooks you in, but after about fifty pages shapes start to dance in front of your eyes and you get this weird urge to do a Final Destination and jam a piece of lawnmower into your right eye. Really, though. It's not about the writing. It's not Capote, but it's not Meyer, either. It's very readable and the derivative world isn't hard to envision. The characters are just annoying and the story bland, and basically, it's one big MEH from me. (There's also that thing with the sorting. What the hell was that? Seriously! Someone explain it to me! I don't understand it!) No, this book really isn't terrible at all. It's probably not even bad. It'll will suck you in with the Matching ceremony (which is fabulously imagined and oh! Just beautiful) but then spit you out right in the middle of a whole pile of smelly old conundrums and teen love. It's another one of those stories that's all about how one teen couple who fall into the trap of instalove will somehow save the world without really doing anything at all except chaste kissing and wangsting about this terrible, terribly dystopian society (that's about as dystopian as my kindergarten). It's about as ridiculous as Darth Maul possessing a small bed-ridden child to cause meddlings among Mystery Inc. Oh noez! (*It's Patrick Wilson!) ...more 1.5 stars Wow.

I wish I could give this book points for the setting, but that barely happened. I know nothing about the Society or why it became that way, and why they think it's better like that. Very little explanation was given. Pages and pages were spent on talking about writing in the sand and a compass and poems and how special Ky is. I didn\u2019t care about any of that. I wanted to know more about all the Hundred Everythings, why and how it happened. I don\u2019t understand the sorting or how it works.

Cassia was selfish, and dull. I tried to like her, but she never really gave me much reason to. Her relationships with Xander and Ky were impassive, I understand that Xander was 'chosen' for her, so there were going to be fireworks every time they touched, but I still didn't even understand their appeal as friends, not just as a romantically involved couple. And the obsession with Ky... why? And that's all that it felt like to me, an obsession. I didn't feel or see the energy between them. The Society wasn't explained very well. Why is The Society there? How did it come to be? Why the current precautions? Why are there people that live in The Society and others that don't? There is a war going on? Why? Where? With who? I had more questions than anything. I didn't know enough about the characters and the life they were living to really care about them. It felt like a very long prologue to another story. The few chapters at the end of the story piqued my interest somewhat, but even then it was tainted with how I had felt through most of the entire novel. It was beautifully written... but I just couldn't get into it. Still undecided on reading the rest of the trilogy. ...more Soo... basic storyline being of a society where officials decide every aspect of a person's life from the big stuff as in who they'll marry (or be 'matched' with) and when they'll die to the little stuff like what they eat, how they dress and their daily routines.

Great sounding plot, am I right? Too bad it turned out to be rather mediocre in practice. Well, for me this book managed to redeem itself right near the very end and escape being the \"it's ok\" marker. One of the biggest problems was the hype about this book, I've been waiting to get my hands on this for ages, just dying to sink my teeth into it - after all, dystopian fiction is my one true literary love. So, because of this, the disappointment fell even heavier. I love the idea but there were just so many things about the story that made me feel it never really took off and reached it's full potential. To make my point, I'm going to review the novel as two parts: first as a dystopian novel, and then as a love story. As I already mentioned, I love dystopian societies and I have done ever since I read Nineteen Eighty-Four when I was twelve. However, my love for dystopia is concentrated on the high action and/or shocking tragedy that define the genre. In my opinion, it's hard to feel a great sense of dystopia in Matched. Nothing majorly tragic or gripping happens until the last few chapters and by then you've lost touch with the story and the characters. It's slow-moving and, though I never thought I'd use this phrase in a review, it 'lacks drama'. If you compare it to 'The Handmaid's Tale' or 'Declaration' for example, there's none of that built up tension throughout. I read these books on the edge of my seat feeling every emotion with the protagonists and even beginning to panic at the peaks of the two novels. Matched just never got my blood pressure up, there was no sense of urgency or despair. For a long time the society didn't really seem that bad at all. Where's the dystopia? The action? The despair? Maybe I'm just a twisted individual but the society wasn't 'bad' enough for me. And the love story. Because that's the other thing this novel is about. Well, the only time I felt any real connection or chemistry between Cassia and Ky was in the last few chapters, I could sense that the author was attempting to build it up slowly but I never latched on to it. In fact, for a good while all I did was feel sorry for poor Xander and wish she'd just except a life with him and let Ky get on with being mysterious and weird. But, it did pull back and the novel ended with me wanting Cassia to go find him. There may be hope for this love story yet. The ending was the most commendable part of the novel. I'd started to think that there would be no point in me buying the second book in the series as the first one had done nothing for me. And then the ending left me interested, engrossed and eager to find out more. It opened up a wider mystery that would have been so much better if the author had built it up by slowly alluding to it throughout the novel, then I wouldn't have been so shocked to find that the book wasn't so terrible overall. I will say, though, I loved her Grandad from Cassia's first conversation with him, I found him cute and lovable - far more intriguing than any other character. I might get the second book because of an unexpected need to find out where the author will take us next. I did enjoy parts of it, especially the ending, I'm just a strange individual who's more into dark dystopia, I have too high expectations of the genre. Also, with the girl in that stunning green dress, it will look way too pretty on your bookshelf. ...more Book Review Okay I promised I'll write an in depth review so here it is and I'll try to not put biggie spoilers.

What do you love about the book? >Okay there are many things I love about this book: a. Writing Style - it was prose with a mix of poetry (somewhat lyrical) so if you adore Maggie Stiefvater's or Carrie Ryan's style of writing you probably would love Ally Condie's style as well. b. Cassia (the heroine) - actually the heroine was not annoying and she has a strong voice. To be more specific, her character at first was a weak one and as the story progresses, her way of thinking changes and it got deeper and deeper. She actually got a good character development and she has a lot of epiphanies about her so-called perfect society and that's what I love about her. Everything around her seems perfect when you look at it superficially but when you try to analyze it deeper there society was perfect but they have no choices, no freedom at all, they're like society's puppets. c. The love story - at first the love story was idk just a love story, but it has actually implies idk what you call that uhhhm symbolism or whatever...so yeah this is what I just think about it: Xander vs Ky or this could mean (own interpretation folks) Conformity vs. Rebellion Known vs. Unknown Perfection vs. Imperfection Love that was dictated by Society vs. Love that was dictated by oneself d. Ky and Cassia's relationship - it builds up (it actually builds up *sorry for the repetition folks*). So yeah I just wanna rant those other books wherein yeah the boy meets girl or rather the girl meets boy and then baaaaaaam for 5 seconds they freaking love each other (like they're soulmates or idk destined for each other *gags*). Come on that was so unrealistic when authors do that, it seems they're too lazy to write the part of you know \"getting-to-know-each-other\" part of a relationship *coughs*. So yeah :) that was what I like about this book, I mean yeah whatever idk how to explains it but they actually have that \"getting-to-know-each-other\" thingy. And idk when I was reading this book I felt like I'm not reading it (if you know what I mean), I felt like I was existing inside the book. Like I was Cassia and I felt all her emotions and I empathize with her problems and I can see her world right into my eyes. So yeah I just felt that while I was reading this, I would definitely pick every choices that Cassia made. I know that in my hearts of heart I would fall in love with Ky even though it was forbidden, even though my Society says that Xander was the one I was suppose to marry. I mean there's just something about Ky that pulls you into him even if it was dangerous. Ky was mysterious and his story was what urge me to know more about him (just like Cassia). Is it that wonderful when you actually was curious to know more about a person because of his/her imperfection and rather of his/her perfection? What do you hate about the book? a. It was unoriginal. > Actually there's something about this book that screams out Rip-off and Plagiarism *ever read The Giver and Hunger Games?*. Yeah but I think since this book was in the genre of utopia/dystopia, maybe there were just a few things/elements that will be always similar like: -The Political Intrigue -Human vs. Society -Rebellion -\"The Government/Society Lied\" thingy or \"Your whole life was a lie\" thingy -the protagonist will always have moments of \"Epiphany\" on the book -Social Manipulation sort of stuff -Philosophical and Political morals/ideas that would be shove into your throat as the storyline progresses b. I felt that the book was idk the term uhhhhm \"bridge\" or \"exposition/ introduction\" for the other books. I mean in this book there are hints that some people outside the province were actually rebelling and there's like a war blah blah blah. But in this book the rebellion was not yet elaborated so I think that will be for the next books to come. c. I love it but the ending , I felt that it wasn't an ending at all. Idk there are so many questions that are left hanging and I felt that to be able to really judge this book you need to read the whole series and how things will be played out in the end. So yeah I need the next book pretty fast! What are other books you want to recommend with the same genre? Okay so I just list them here, I'll divide dystopia and utopia and will sort of rank them out: Dystopia: 1. (5stars) (5stars) (both 1 star and 5stars) 2. (5stars) (2stars) 3. (5stars) 4. (4stars) (2stars) Utopia: 1. (5stars) 2. (2stars) 3. (2stars) Note: Weeeeee! I just finished Matched and it was AMAZING. I want more!!! I love Ky Markham btw he kinda reminds me of someone *daydream for a moment* *coughs* the guy I fallen in love with in High School *coughs* (Eeeeeeeeeeek, *violently shoves someone*) Yeah and I just want to share a conversation with my classmate here: Joyzi: Hey I recommend you to read the Hunger Games it was so amazing blah blah blah and I read it like in one sitting cuz I can't put it down and Peeta was so sweet and everything blah blah blah, best book ever blah blah Friend: ah okay :) After a few days... Joyzi: Hey have you finished the Hunger Games? Friend: No I don't want to read it. Joyzi: Why? Friend: I kinda go to wikipedia and I found out it was a violent book, children killing children kinda. Joyzi: Yeah it was pretty violent. Why? Don't you wanna read something that has gore on it? Friend: Sorry friend but violence is not my cuppa. (So yeah I think I just recommend Matched by Ally Condie to my friend, because this book has zero violence but has an amazing Dystopia theme *it was quite similar to the Giver but this one has romance and the writing was breathtakingly beautiful*) Yeah, idk what else to say, I will have an in depth review of the book on Sunday. ********************************************************** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaeNWL...

And what struck me about some of them was that it was supposed to be the perfect, future society, but everyone just seemed so sweaty . . . But not so in the Society. Everything is carefully sanitized. Clothes are clean, or quickly changed when they are not. The world has been cleaned up: there are only one hundred poems left, one hundred paintings . . . because too many choices, too many THINGS contributed to the confusion of their ancestors (us, in short). The world has been streamlined, recycled, and recreated into this sterile perfection, and it fascinated me. I loved the fact that Cassia feels like things are spiraling out of control, and they are, for her. But she continues to eat her specially prepared meals, continues to go to work and to the school, so the temptation to succumb, to go back to the dreamy calm of no choices and no worries is always there. The reader wonders until the last page: what will she do? Will the Society pull her back in, or will she rebel? Her dilemma is artfully done, and there is appeal in both of her choices. It was what kept me reading, along with the flawlessness of this serene Society which Ally Condie has created. So, this book has been heavily promoted. (I should be so lucky as to have PR like this!) And with that comes the fear that the book itself isn't very good, just the PR team. Well, have no fear, my people! The book is worth the hype. This is 1984 for teens, and it works. Also, I myself am not a \"romance\" person, particularly when it comes to YA. I will admit there have been other books in which my eyes rolled so much I feared they would fall out. I loved the romance in this one, I thought it was very natural and very well done. Two thumbs way up for Ally and MATCHED! Can't wait for the sequel! ...more This book is like a long train ride.

The train will leave again, probably next year. And you know what? I'm not freaking taking it. I'll stick to other modes of transportation. *note: It's not that this was awful ; it wasn't. Two stars means \"it was ok\" and that just about sums it up. ...more So I didn't expect them to at all, but a little part of me was really hoping Scholastic would come to BEA with a stack of galleys for \"Mockingjay\" the way they did with \"Catching Fire.\" Of course they didn't, they wouldn't want to ruin the end of the trilogy before it's released. But a girl can dream. So, anyway, there was a big gap in my galley pile that could only be filled by some quality YA distopian fiction.

When I went to the YA Editors' Buzz panel and heard about \"Matched\" I thought \"Yes! This is what I'll read instead.\" And then--blah. The editor dutifully talked this book up and it did not rise to my expectations. There is no urgency to this book at all, and it's not terribly creative. My favorite part of distopian fiction is slowly uncovering the new world the author has shaped. What are people's roles in this society? Why is everyone acting so weird? Ohh, what's that pill for?! But there was no real mystery here. Cassia's \"Society\" is pretty much just a cross between \"The Giver\" and \"1984.\" But halfway through the book I really didn't care what the red pill did, and when we found out I thought \"yeah, I guess that's about right.\" I also thought \"If you're only allowed to take those pills at the command and in the presence of a high official, then why do people carry them around with them at all times, anyway? Shouldn't the officials just carry them so no one takes one accidentally, or on a dare?\" But no, we had to manufacture the one thing everyone wonders about in this society, so it's there in their little tablet vials. And then plot is just a romance, and not a terribly compelling one. I know, I'm 27, and I'm not supposed to give a shit about teenage romance. But some authors make me care. Suzanne Collins made me care, John Green makes me care. This is more \"Twilight\" love triangle romance where I don't really care about anyone involved, and therefore am ambivalent about the outcome. And then there isn't really anything else to this story to keep me entertained. If we're supposed to care about the weird unrest occurring within \"The Society\" we're not given enough information to do so convincingly. So here I am, sitting with a bunch of 17-year-olds freaking out about first love, and I kind of want to punch them in the face. This book will probably be reasonably successful. Everyone loves a distopian future setting these days, and if \"Twilight\" is any indication, girls will gobble up the romance. (Although neither Ky nor Xander is the next Edward, so maybe I'm wrong. Teenagers these days, right?! Huh?) Me, I'm just going to wait impatiently for \" Mockingjay \" to finally come out. ...more When I heard Condie's trilogy was being pushed as the next big thing, I instantly expected this to be cheap, tantalizing but empty, and poorly written.

Ever since, I've been anxiously trying to get my hands on an ARC of Matched. I really wanted it to be as good as her publisher thinks it is. I sat down Friday afternoon with my friend's ARC (and more than a little anxiety) and didn't close the book until I finished. I don't know how Condie managed to make a perfect society where nothing ever happens so intriguing, but she does. From the beginning she pulls you into this world and keeps you interested. You never know when an Official is going to pop up in Cassie's seemingly perfect life to call her out for insubordination to the society's propaganda. Condie ties a clean writing style into this sterile dystopia which builds on the naivete of its citizens. It's not simplistic in a poorly written sense--there are moments when Condie shines with beauty--it's simplistic in a stylistic sense. And it works too in capturing Cassie's teenage mind. Condie's weak point is her characterization. I never fully grasped Cassie or Xander or Ky beyond a general characterization, but my fear for the characters and curiosity about the love triangle was strong enough to make me keep turning pages. And I doubt the depth I wanted and my other issues with plot and character will faze the intended audience. This isn't crossover fiction; it's purely YA. I can see why her publisher wanted this. It has that \"it\" quality in YA commercial fiction that I can't quite explain but that will grip its teenage audience the way other reads may not. I won't go into my usual in-depth review since most people haven't read it, but if you read YA commercial fiction, you don't want to miss this one. The scoop from someone I know who's read a draft of the sequel is that it's amazing, but we'll all have to wait a year for that one. Matched comes on November 30. Go, preorder it now. (About the cover: Am I the only one who doesn't like it? I never would have picked this book off the shelf. The glimmery background is cool, but the gray doesn't stand out. The dress, which is supposed to be the gorgeous dress Cassie wears to her Matching, is meh, and her hands don't line up with the bubble, which irritates me. I'm glad Dutton is pushing a book with writing talent, but I think they could have done better on the cover.) ...more WHAT MADE ME READ THE BOOK?

With hours of driving ahead of me, I had no choice but to give it a chance. And I loved it. Matched is extremely character-centric. There\u2019s very little plot to speak of, and there aren\u2019t many oscillations in the narrative structure. While it\u2019s a beautiful, gentle read, exciting isn\u2019t a word that applies. In all honesty, I didn\u2019t mind one bit, the character growth was enough to keep me happy and my mind fully occupied. I won\u2019t go into the love triangle lest I spoil what little plot there is. Suffice it to say that it\u2019s not really a love triangle as it\u2019s clear from the beginning what Cassia feels for Xander and what she feels for Ky. As someone who dislikes love triangles on general principle, I must confess that this one wasn\u2019t nearly as torturous as I\u2019d originally assumed. I love that Condie approached the Society in a very mature way, always aware that while it might be bad for some, it saved many others; and I don\u2019t just mean those who hold the power, but regular people who are better off because the Society took care of them. This is somewhat new in dystopian literature and I admire Condie for thoroughly exploring the gray areas and not portraying the Society as the source of all evil. What is awful and constrictive for some may very well be great for others. Cassia\u2019s thoughts about those who are not free-spirited by nature and who are very comfortable being taken care of by the Society endeared her to me greatly. She was never judgmental or harsh, and she understood that people find comfort and happiness in different things, and that for some, nothing works better than having all their decisions taken away from them. Some things about the Society were more believable than others but I took them all in stride as inevitable parts of the genre. However, there was one thing central to the story that I simply couldn\u2019t accept. In the Society, people use tablets to write, but no one writes or reads cursive anymore. In fact, they have nothing to write with and they\u2019d surely get into trouble for even attempting it. As someone who\u2019s spent years studying language(s), I find it hard to believe that people would allow themselves to lose their ability to write. I\u2019ve read a research or two a couple of years ago that focused on this possibility (and it was considered to be a possibility), but it seems very unlikely to me. I suppose I should write a few words about Kate Simses, the audiobook narrator, as well. At first I was uncomfortable with her mellow, almost childish voice, but as I got to know Cassia, I realized that it fits her perfectly. (That said, she also narrated Shatter Me, and somehow I doubt her voice worked as well for Juliette.) She never fell into the trap of overdoing male voices as so many narrators do, and I really liked how easily she used her voice to make the differences between Ky and Xander even more pronounced. Matched is a read only for the patient, but it is very rewarding. If you\u2019re like me and you\u2019re avoiding it because of the love triangle, learn from my mistake. I should have read it much sooner. ...more 3 for enjoyment, 2 for substance.

Here's my main problem with it: Right before I read this book, I read Delirium by Lauren Oliver. I don't know which one came out first, but they have very similar plots. 1) Dystopian society in which everyone's fates are planned for them. 2) Main character is a teenage girl. 3) Girl is supposed to marry a boring guy. 4) Girl falls for another, rebellious guy instead. Each has its own original aspects, but they both have the same general plot; understandably, I can't help but draw comparisons between the two, and Matched was not the winner. Don't get me wrong\u2013\u2013it's not a bad book. And if you are eagerly gobbling up all the books in the current dystopian craze (thank you, Hunger Games *grumbles*) you'll probably like this. I liked some aspects of it (like the thing where everyone has three pills ... I'm too tired to explain it, but if you've read it you know what I mean. That was a cool idea.) Also, the writing was pretty decent. But personally, I don't think I liked it enough to pick up the sequel. First of all, I didn't like the main character very much. She didn't really do anything to make me hate her, but she was just ... boring, not too-perfect but not flawed enough either. Actually, I didn't think any of the characters were extremely compelling. Ky was the coolest character, but even so I thought he was kind of a stereotypical sensitive-emo-guy-with-a-tortured-past (and he writes POETRY!) And as for the plot, it wasn't terribly original. While I was able to see past the lack of originality in Delirium (since the characters, writing, and romance were more compelling), I had difficulty doing so for Matched because the plot wasn't very exciting. It got more interesting towards the end, but the bulk of it was pretty repetitive ... Mostly just Ky and Cassia walking through the woods and not doing much of anything. At least I give Ally Condie props for not rushing the romance too much. In a lot of romance books (especially nowadays) the two main characters just pounce on each other within the first 50 pages (because they're SOULMAAAATES! SO DAMN CREDIBILITY!) and are inseparable for the rest of the book. So at least Condie develops the relationship between Ky and Cassia, and makes the reader wait for the kissing and whatnot ... (view spoiler) [Kind of hated the ending ... Like, \"HAHA WE SET UP THE WHOLE THING.\" Seemed rather far-fetched to me. Blah. (hide spoiler) ] Well, in the end, I don't think it's a must-read but at least it was somewhat entertaining. ...more \u201cEvery minute you spend with someone gives them a part of your life and takes part of theirs.\u201d Originally posted on Stellar Scrutiny Book Blog.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that this book was terrible, but it just had nothing appealing at all . If you have read The Giver by Lois Lowry, then you\u00a0would know that it had a very distinct and inspirational, dystopian setting. It is the basis for practically every dystopia, so I have no problem when I see parallels between The Giver and whatever other book I'm reading. That being said, I was ticked off that Matched literally takes The Giver's setting and has no unique spin on it. It's the exact same setting! It was like Ally Condie decided to write her own fanfic of The Giver . I imagine her train of thought was something like this: Oh my gosh, what if the Giver had love triangles and kissing! Lots and lots of kissing! That would be puuuuuuuuurfect! You don't need a plot, just have tons of making out, especially since it's not allowed! And one of the boys must write poetry! Because that makes him so dreamy and hot, and not cliche at all! Ooh, and how about I make Pretty Boy super sweet and nice! That will make it impossible for my Mary Sue to choose between them! Mwhuahahaha! I'm not even kidding, I truly believe that's what the author was thinking when she wrote this. Ugh, this book. Just, ugh!!! The main problem was the snail pace. If it went any slower it'd be going backwards (which it might have been, come to think of it). Literally nothing happens! NOTHING! Where's the action? Climax? Turning point? Anything!? The whole darn book was nothing but Cassia's relationship with Ky! Speaking of which, why is every male Asian character in YA literature named Ky? *sigh* Anyway, Ky is the cliche, rebellious emo guy that's in every teen romance book, except wait! There's more. He writes POETRY! Yes, poetry! Someone shoot me already. It can't get any worse than that, right? Think again... \u201cAngels?\u201d \u201cYou know. The ones in the old stories.

No. Do you?\u201d \u201cI believe in you.\u201d I've never groaned so much while reading a book, in all my life. I couldn't help myself! Some of the dialogue was absolutely awful! Thankfully, Cassia and Xander's conversations weren't super cheesy and/or annoying. Xander is the typical best-friend-who-I-love-like-a-brother, and he's hardly even in the book! And even when he is, all Cassia thinks about is Oh Ky, I wonder what his lips would feel like on mine... Cassia wasn't an awful protagonist, but she was just so boring! I actually forgot her name when I first started writing this review. I have a few questions about this book...just a few. - What the heck is sorting and how is it significant to the Society? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but at any point in the book was it specified what you use sorting for??? You expect me to believe that Cassia spent her whole life sorting number on a screen for no apparent reason, and not a single soul in the Society questions this? The only time Cassia actually sorts anything, it's of workers being separated into groups based on their proficiency. She spent her entire life preparing for that !? Give me a break. - No one in the community can write. Let me get this straight. In a community where EVERYONE knows how to read and type on computers don't know how to WRITE!? What the heck? Where's the logic in that!? Sure, she might not know how to write cursive, but not being able to write at all? Are you serious? - I'd like to know how the blue pills work. They're for emergencies , but what exactly does that mean? Is it some kind of intense painkiller or a magical pill that mends bones? Either guess is possible, because WE AREN'T TOLD ANYTHING! Also, I couldn't help but think of this every time the pills were mentioned. -Ahem, I couldn't seem to find an antagonist in this story, do I need glasses? I seem to recall that one Official being in the story, but she couldn't possibly be the villain since she was only in the story like three times...right? Well, that's about as close as we get to an antagonist! And don't even get me started on the ending! That was supposed to be a cliffhanger? Really? I honestly didn't even realize the story ended and had to reread the last 5 pages just to be sure (so I could celebrate). It was abrupt, inconclusive, and doesn't even make me want to read the sequel. There wasn't necessarily anything I hated about this book, but I couldn't find anything that I really liked .\u00a0I'll cut Condie some slack, the cover was beautiful, writing was decent, and Ky & Xander, cliche as they are, were fairly likable. But, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone...unless you're a fan of\u00a0cliche\u00a0love triangles and haven't read The Giver ? Maybe? On another matter, this is the first rant on my blog! I'm so proud of myself! ;) ...more This book actually made me feel like I was the one trapped inside the bubble. I wanted to scream, \"Run! Can't you people see what's happening? Don't take that pill!\" I couldn't breathe until it was over. Very good writing that sucked me in and made me very grateful that I have the freedom to choose what I want to be and do. If I may be politely honest, I would have to say that this series is one of the dystopians series I liked the least. The concept of the society where everything is controlled, measured and dictated by the government is, I think a good idea.

Even the main conflict, when Cassia's chip showed her the face of Ky abruptly and quickly when Xander has already been determined to be her match is fascinating and intriguing and these elements would have already been really useful tools to make a really really great story, however, I think the author failed to use these elements very wisely. The pacing is just too slow, the dialogues are dull and the transitions of events are not at all eventful. I only finished the book because I wanted to know which guy Cassia will end up with but the events leading to that (which will not even be revealed until Book 3) are only slightly interesting. ...more I don't normally talk about covers, but this one is just so perfect, if a little obvious.

The rest of the novel is about her forbidden relationship with Ky and how she learns to keep things hidden in a secret-less Society. Nothing else happens. At the end of the novel (view spoiler) [Ky gets taken away, but not because of the forbidden romance. Cassia's family is relocated, but not because of the forbidden romance. (hide spoiler) ] For a YA dystopian romance, it didn't lead where I thought it would lead. I even read spoilers for the sequel Crossed , and came to the conclusion that at the end of this book, Cassia and Ky must run away Logan's Run style to be with each other away from the Society that controls their every move. But no. Pretty much nothing changes. The only interesting thing that happened was off-screen (so to speak). By that I mean some kind of rebellion that Cass doesn't know much about because everything is so regulated. Even their food. One person grows the food, another processes it, another cooks it and another delivers. It's like the complete opposite of today's society, where more and more governments try to make people responsible for their own health and safety. EDIT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS NOVEL: THERE IS NO ACT THREE. I finally figured it out when I was planning one of my own novels. There's nothing for Cassia to fight against, there's hardly any central conflict, and there is certainly no resolution. Let's explore this using a Writer's Digest one-page plan (which can be found at http://www.writersdigest.com/wp-conte... ) I will hide this in a spoiler warning because some people are pedantic. (view spoiler) [ How does your hero begin to successfully attack their need/quest? She doesn't do anything. She goes on living her life. \u2022\thow does the antagonistic force respond to this attack? They continue to monitor her and otherwise take no action. \u2022\thow do the hero\u2019s inner demons come to bear on this attack? Nothing happens, so there's no inner demons. What is the all-is-lost lull just before the second plot point? There isn't one. What is the second plot point in your story? There isn't one. \u2022\thow does this change or affect the hero\u2019s proactive role? She doesn't have a proactive role. How is your hero the primary catalyst for the successful resolution of the central problem or issue in this story? She isn't. There is no successful resolution of the central problem. There is hardly a central problem. \u2022\thow does it meet the hero\u2019s need and fulfill the quest? Nothing is fulfilled. \u2022\thow does the hero demonstrate the conquering of inner demons? She doesn't. She continues to do as she's told. \u2022\thow are the stakes of the story paid off? The most frustrating thing about this novel is this point. The stakes don't pay off. The characters get separated and then the story ends. There is no excitement or charged emotion in anything that happens. \u2022\twhat will be the reader\u2019s emotional experience as the story concludes? Hmm... slight disappointment? I hate to rate a book down just because it doesn't do what I want it to do, but I was still expecting a big explosive Logan's Run-style climax. There was no climax. It just disappointed me because the whole book was on the developing forbidden romance and there was nothing either of them did to continue the romance. Nothing was risked. I know it's a dystopian and Society controls anything but I thought that Cass was learning to be independent - she was learning to write even though it was illegal, why didn't she take the next logical step and run away with her forbidden love? (hide spoiler) ] END EDIT I once saw a print commercial for a mobile phone that had a young woman walking at night into a dark tunnel. It said something like, \"If she had a phone, she'd feel safe.\" This is what today's society wants to do: make everyone responsible for themselves at their own expense rather than the government's expense. The hint and threat of rape is eased if the individual takes personal responsibility for their own safety. But the darkened tunnel couldn't possibly have bright lights added to it, or the road next to it couldn't have its trees and bushes cut down, because that would take money away from the governments, not the individuals (who pay for their own phone). Matched was like the complete opposite of that commercial. I enjoyed reading about how different the society was and guessing how it came about and pretty much managed to scare myself into thinking it's a plausible future. No one knows how to write: it's forbidden. They learn how to type and copy things others have written. In an attempt to de-clutter the society, citizens can only own one personal possession: an artefact of the days gone by handed down from a relative. (view spoiler) [Even those ended up being taken away. (hide spoiler) ] In the same attempt to de-clutter, there are only one hundred poems, one hundred songs, one hundred paintings that people can learn about and remember. Everything else has been destroyed. It's like the scariest version of futuristic communism I've ever read about. You don't ask questions. You don't think for yourself. Cass is told exactly how far and how fast she must run to keep her optimal BMI. Everything is tightly regulated from data gathered and predications made based on that data. Even their dreams are monitored. Privacy and freedom are surrendered to make the 'perfect' society. I guess that's why they call it a dystopia. This book is a freaking study in dystopias. I absolutely loved the references to Dylan Thomas' poem \"Do Not Go Gently Into That Good Night.\" I love that poem so much. It's rhyming structure is referred to as villanelle, and I have a distinct weakness for villanelles. I loved how the poem spoke so strongly to Cass and I love how it influenced her. I won't be reading the sequel. I feel it's almost superfluous: this book could so very nearly have been a stand-alone in the rare times of the over-abundance of YA trilogies. I can't even say whether or not I want to re-read it. Unlike its contemporary dystopian, Divergent , there was a lack of action, and even though the plot holes were not as numerous, it just didn't grab me as much as I wanted it to. However, this dystopia I feel is even more plausible than Divergent, so if you want to be horrified by society in general and people in particular, give this baby a go. SPOILER TIME - or rather, a rant on inclusiveness. I don't really know if this is because Ally Condie is from Utah, I don't know her personal stance on homosexuality and I don't know how she would write about it even if she was for or against. But there is a distinct lack of homosexuality in Matched. Young people who choose that they want to be Matched do so because they are going to reproduce the healthiest most genetically perfect offspring. They're seventeen when they're Matched which means they're younger than that when they make that life choice. Those who choose not to be Matched are classified as Singles. Singles can still go on dates but I'm pretty sure they're not allowed to reproduce. This is all very heteronormative. It's expected that each Matched couple is heterosexual and will engage in heterosexual intercourse for the purpose of reproduction, not pleasure. Even when Cass is falling in love with Ky there is never anything sexual behind her feelings, never any sneaking glances at, for example, his stomach or his shoulders or his legs. It's a very innocent 'love' that's all to do with his eyes and hands, and the obsession with his hands is because he's a manual labourer and he knows how to write, not because she wants his hands on her. What the hell happened to all the gay people? Are they executed? Are they Aberrations? Are they shipped off to the Outer Provinces? Are they not allowed to raise children of their own? What if someone didn't realise they were gay until after they were Matched, or after they were contracted (age 21)? It's not even that Condie doesn't have a gay or disabled character. That's fine. That's not what the story is about. But it's the structure of the society itself that excludes gay people. And those with a disability. Genetic disabilities and birth defects have been bred out of the population, I know that. But you can't breed out gay. You can't breed out disabilities as a result of a workplace accident. How does the Society cope with these people? If they do send disabled and gay people to the outer Provinces, how would they even tell a closeted homosexual from a heterosexual? Where are all the gay people? Where are their options? Can gay couples be Matched? What would be the point of that, if they can't reproduce by themselves? Would anyone help them reproduce? Do normal, healthy, compatible yet infertile couples get help to reproduce? If someone is Matched yet their partner dies early from an outside influence, can they be Matched again? Maybe that's why it's a dystopia. ...more No...

But he is not. Ky is probably more intelligent than any other character of this book. He is skilled, he is intelligent and he is absolutely charming. I love his deep personality and his bittersweet relationship with Cassia. \u201cWhy are some things easier to write than say?\u201d They do not touch very often, but each dialogue between these two is like a soft touch.

I love the characters, all of them...Okay, sorry, I actually hate the Members of the Society. They kinda freak me out. I love the world they live in. Not like I would like to live in such a world, I think I would go insane in Cassia's world or I would be really paranoid. But I love that is so authentic and really and frightening. \u201cI think of how perhaps the best way to fly would be with hands full of earth, so you always remember where you came from.\u201d ...more Blurbed by Melina Marchetta: 'Beautifully written with characters that stayed with me long after the final page,' and with it's stunning cover, Matched is the shiny new temptation of the season.

Matched begins with the Matching Banquet, on Cassia's 17th birthday, where Cassia is Matched by the Society to her long time best friend, Xander. She's thrilled, but then a glitch causes things to unravel and Cassia starts questioning more than just her match... Oooh - something's going to go down... Kind of. Because the pacing is a slow. It's a deliberate build, more introspective than action. However, I found it compulsively readable. I casually sailed through the first 2/3's and then the final third really comes into it's own. By then it felt like the story was into it's own completely addictive groove and by the time it ended, I was ready to pick up the next installment (Ah, Dec 2011, it's a while away...). Rather than it being gritty with undertones of foreboding - it is more laying the ground work for a future rebellion and show-down - taking Cassia from a place of acceptance of the Society, to questioning and ultimately finding a strength inside of her that will alter the course of her life. It's very much a coming of age novel set in a manufactured world. Condie has laid all the groundwork for some thrilling discoveries, impossible choices and deadly stakes. (re: thrilling discoveries, impossible choice and deadly stakes - it was kind of lacking in this title - but I'm thinking they're coming in the next, yeah?) Xander and Ky are both stand-out characters (although neither had me swooning - what was with that? Two guys and neither one did anything for me?) However, I so appreciated the restraint Condie showed in fashioning the love triangle aspect - it does not tread the well worn path of YA melodrama (although I'm hoping she'll amp it up a bit in the sequels in terms of choices and stakes). The prose. Some have called it beautiful. It does read effortlessly - and there's a few instances of lovely thoughtful introspection and nice phrases. There's also a lot of prose. As in, occasionally, it feels overwritten - I sometimes felt that urge to skim over redundant paragraphs. Recommended: This is right in the pocket of the YA market and all my teen readers out there (love you guys!) are sure to enjoy and devour it and maybe even find it earning a starred place on your favourites shelf. It's an entry level novel into dystopian worlds, perfectly suitable for mature middle grade readers. It's a squeaky clean read. As for adult readers who are still digging the YA scene, it's enjoyable, sure, and perfect for a rainy-day comfort read. As Alexa said: A word of warning though, if you are looking for a book to fill the void left by the end of The Hunger Games, this may not be for you, despite the dystopian tag. Matched is more reminiscent of the coming of age/romance you might expect from Sarah Dessen. It is quiet, and it is beautiful, and it is well worth reading. (and I get what she means) - which worked okay for me as I love that Sarah Dessen vibe. ...more Once upon a time, There was a girl who wandered through the stacks until she saw the word \"Matched\" printed on a cover in lime, With a squeal she snatched it down, Admiring the model's gown, In delight she read the back, And Hallelujah - nothing did the description lack, Love, rebellion and more, Surely reading this wouldn't be a chore, So she started out on page one, And immediately she wanted to shoot it with a gun, But bravely she read on, All the while thinking \"what a con\", The MC had a contrived love Once upon a time, There was a girl who wandered through the stacks until she saw the word \"Matched\" printed on a cover in lime, With a squeal she snatched it down, Admiring the model's gown, In delight she read the back, And Hallelujah - nothing did the description lack, Love, rebellion and more, Surely reading this wouldn't be a chore, So she started out on page one, And immediately she wanted to shoot it with a gun, But bravely she read on, All the while thinking \"what a con\", The MC had a contrived love for poetry, Plus there was no chemistry, And are those people crying over cut down trees?
