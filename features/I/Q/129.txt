Writing books should never be about just the money; it should be about making an impact on society, actually furthering your story arc, something, anything but swindling people out of their hard-earned cash on a book that really should never have been published. But that's the world we live in today, isn't it? Authors that actually have good, original, stories and put their heart and soul into their writing are turned down just because of today's pop culture; those millions of little idiotic girls screaming for the next Edward and Bella. I don't think I've ever been more unhappy to see a book published than Twilight; honestly, it changed the whole dynamic for YA and that's basically all we've gotten since then. Shit-tons of TSTL girls, overly protective-and in some ways downright abusive- guys, with plots as slow as molasses, horrible research skills, and characters/ story arcs that authors just add in or throw out for the hell of it. I'm sick. Sick and tired of it. This is what I feel like doing to all of those authors right about now: Oh, and some of this: Edit: So.....she's calling this book a saga?!

I will not simply expect this book to be terrible, because if I do, I'll automatically believe it as terrible even if it is not. And the old review was kind of uncalled for. \"Will love survive the ultimate finale? So, you want to talk about love, eh? Let me tell you something upfront before I go into detail: What Patch and Nora have is not love. In fact, I don't think it can even be called lust at this point. I don't know if my idea of true love is extreme and unrealistic, or if this book's version of love is a disgrace. I think true love is when you actually connect with someone. Someone who changed your life, who opened your mind, who you can share secrets with, who gets you, whose mind works the same way as yours. Someone you admire and who accepts your quirks and strangeness, and has imperfections of their own that you deal with. Someone who makes you feel like your at home no matter where you are. That's how I define love. Now, like I said, maybe that's totally unrealistic. If it is, then it looks like I'm gonna die alone because I refuse to settle for anything less. But even so, I can honestly say that what Nora and Patch have is not at all love. First of all, does Nora ever mention something about Patch's personality that she likes? No. She says that he's infuriating and mysterious. That's it. She doesn't admire anything about him or mention any qualities he possesses. She talks about his hotness and his muscles. That's pretty much it. Patch... I don't even know what he sees in Nora. At all. Maybe because she's seems so eager to be his loveslave? I have no clue. There are prettier, sluttier, curvier, smarter, more interesting girls in his high school than Nora. Really, the only thing special about her is her obsessive stalking. Otherwise, how does she stand out? It's not like he ever says, \"Nora, you're such a deep thinker\" or \"Nora, I love how you always look out for your friends.\" (BTW, she does neither of those things.) No, he just acts douchey and talks about how hot she is. YOU FAIL AT LOVE. June 8th, 2012 Edit: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA THAT COVER! Oh my god, that is fucking hilarious.

I am posting my final review of this hunk of rectal sputum book series, and you had better believe there are going to be some serious spoilers. Silence , the third book in the series, left off with <---C>Nora Grey</---C> killing the Black Hand, Hank Millar. She has sworn a blood-oath to become the new leader of the Nephilim army and lead the race in a war against the fallen angels. It's not that she wants to lead the army - she wants peace on earth and no more bloodshed for either race. But it's a case of if she doesn't lead the army, she and her mum will die. Behold the morality of your new leader, Nephilim . Nora Grey doesn't much care that fallen angels routinely possess your bodies . It's not terribly important to her that you are an enslaved race. She thinks slave and captor alike should just put down their weapons and love each other. However she's chosen to \"lead you\", to save her mum. Twat. So that's how we begin the final leg of this story. Our bird-brained heroine Nora Grey, whose name perfectly illustrates her personality, has been made a fucking war general. And how does she deal with this? She goes clubbing. So she and BFF Vee are all up in da club when we are introduced to brand new character Dante: menacingly flirtatious Nephil, Nora's self-appointed PR manager and essentially wants to be seen as the Clegg to her Cameron (if you don't immediately think he has an agenda, signal your presence to the guard and get your ass back to preschool). After flirting with Nora for longer than is necessary, Dante tells her it would be a good idea to boost her media presence, show her under a positive light, give her new Nephilim army a reason to like her. Straight off the bat it should not be known that Nora is having secret facenoms with a fallen angel, so maybe she should pretend to be in a relationship with a nice Nephil boy, someone like Scott (pointless secondary character who has literally contributed fuckall to the plot). \"Oh no,\" says Nora, \"he's a friend! It would be too weird, and besides my BFF fancies the pants off the man. Suggest someone else, go on, I dare you.\" \"Me.\" shrugs Dante. \"Oh em gee!\" says Nora, fanning herself with her hand, \"I had no idea you were going to suggest yourself. I immediately accept.\" Excuse me, Nora, while I go vomit over your simplicity. We don't have to wait long before Nora is abducted again. This time it's by some very scary Nephilim who throw a bag over her head and drive her to an undisclosed location and - *gasp* - shout at her for five minutes . Yes kids, it's the final book now and the horrors of war are well and truly upon us. In an incredibly interesting turn of events, Nora Grey does not panic. She stays calm, sasses her kidnappers and without hesitation attempts to beat the shit out of them . I kid you not, it actually happened. Behold, direct quote: \"I met Cowboy Hat's eyes coldly...then bucked my foot up with all the force I had and planted it squarely in his chest. He sailed backwards into the wall and crumpled on the floor.\" Now I know this is entirely because Nora is full-blown Nephil now and she has heightened senses and more strength, but hot-damn it is still good to see her actually do something for a change! Sure, Patch shows up fairly quickly to rescue the poor broad, but Nora has already fought her kidnappers and told 'em to jog on . Patch has nothing left to do except drive her home. Never thought I'd say this, but +1 to Nora Grey. So the plot continues with Nora attempting to trick the world into thinking she and Patch have broken up and doing daily training with Dante. To make Nora stronger, Dante slips her a dose of devilcraft, which is a deliberately vague ethereal blue liquid (supposedly from hell) the magical properties of which enable you to do whatever the hell you want without having to explain how it works because plot. It also conveniently explains every single one of the convenient plot-holes in this entire book, and there are too many to even list. Ugh. And then miss Grey goes and gets herself in trouble yet again. Yet nothing goes as expected. An archangel called Pepper holds a gun to Nora. She remains calm and strong. She challenges him. Attempts to get information out of him. She makes use of her rusty, cobweb-covered brainbox in order to think up a plan to get her out of this mess . AND SHE DOES. It was at this point that I had to stop and figure out what the hell had just happened. For three whole books, Nora Grey has been a nothing more than a puddle of existence. She is an established fainter, the kid of girl whose life revolves around her boyfriend, the kind of girl who wipes her nose on Dante's shirt and actually snivels about not being as strong as a natural-born Nephil . The girl's stupidity is mind-blowing: she can't apply logic to even the most basic of scenarios. She fell in love with Patch after he admitted to having tried to murder her for heaven's sake! Nora Grey is a pathetic excuse for a heroine and it is completely out of character for her to be sassy, strong and crafty! It all went from utter confuzzlement to sudden enlightening clarity. Oh Becca Fitzpatrick...it all becomes clear. I see what you have done. In what was either a stunning display of her creative disability or just a massive dick move , Becca Fitzpatrick decided to completely and utterly change Nora Grey's personality. No personal growth, no reflection of change, no puzzlement over the recent turn of events. Is it the fact that she's now Nephilim? Could it be the devilcraft? Do any other characters even acknowledge her complete shift of being? BIG. FAT. NOPE . Nora Grey is now the kind of girl who will stand up for herself without fear and not wait around for her man to rescue her...just... because . On top of it all, Nora has had a complete change of heart RE: the war. Now that she is Nephilim, Nora realizes that - oh shit! - a fallen angel can actually possess me! Well shit. I don't want that to happen, I completely see your point of view now Nephilim, let us fight these sons of bitches and have ourselves some bloodshed! \"You can't constantly protect me, Patch. I appreciate the thought, but I'm Nephilim now. I'm immortal and less in need of our protection. I'm a target of fallen angels, archangels, and other Nephilim, and there's nothing I can do about that. Except learn to fight back.\" 100% out of character. But...points for doing the right thing..? I don't know Nora, I'm trying. Which is expecially difficult considering the next quote: \"Violence wasn't always the way. In fact, most of the time it wasn't. I knew that. But I saw Dante's point of view too. I had to fight back. If I came across as weak, it only hung a larger target on my back. I had to show that I was tough and would retaliate. For the forseeable future, physical strength mattered more than strength of character.\" Nice philosophy, Grey. I could support your change of heart and wanting to fight for Nephilim freedom, if only for your \"shit-it-could-happen-to-me-now-so-I-had-better-do-something\" attitude. But participating in a war for the sake of appearing strong? That earns you a place in hell my friend, as you have the exact same belief system as this guy. Let's attempt to move on, shall we? Cheshvan (the month where possession is possible) is upon them now and the fallen are primed to possess them all pretty much any day now. They're still not strategizing. Nora Grey is the leader of the army, and still she makes no attempt to suss out what the hell they're going to do. She throws a bitching Halloween party though, fallen angels attack them and everything. She fights them off (easily, of course), and still isn't inspired to do some war planning. She just heads off with Dante to some strength training instead... Where Dante informs her... ...the Nephil army has a secret facility where they keep captured fallen angels, weakened by devilcraft, so that Nephilim can learn to possess the fallen angels . Just what is Nora Grey's reaction to this shocking news? [paraphrasing] \"Awesome. Show me how.\" [/paraphrasing] Let. Me. Get. This. Straight. The whole point of this war...the whole reason Nora now wants to be part of it...is because possession is wrong . On a scale of how badly you can violate a person, possession is up there with rape . And Nora Grey doesn't even hesitate to go ahead possess a fallen angel?! Leaving aside the glaring plot hole where it isn't even possible for Nephilim to possess fallen angels (Fitzpatrick explains this by saying \"devilcraft, because shut up\"). Leaving aside the fact that the \"facility\" that Dante is referring to is essentially a goddamn concentration camp . Leaving aside all that...Nora Grey, do you even realize the hypocrisy, the ignorance and the moral indecency of your actions?? Why the hell am I even asking? It's Nora fucking Grey. I am so angry at this book. And this author. At this point I could not believe what I was reading. I actually had a word with my friend Jim about it. At one point I actually begged him to convince me that it was a trick. Surely this would be the whole point of the novel, right? This is how I wanted it to end: Nora gets in over her head and ends up getting her whole Nephilim army to learn the art of possession, leading to a meaningless war of possession left right of centre, thus perfectly illustrating the absurdity of war and how in reality there aren't always clear-cut good guys and bad guys; conflict is not black and white, folks! It would be an interesting reflection on our culture and history, which isn't often seen in the YA genre. In the end, Patch or someone would show Nora the error of her ways and...peaceful conclusion or something? My friend Jim politely reminded me exactly what book series I was reading, and that it was, in all likelihood, not going to end well. But I tried to convince myself. I really did. It was the only way to make it better. It simply had to be put right. So did it? I'll give you three guesses. After a scene where a beaten up, nameless prisoner fallen angel is possessed my Nora...it's not mentioned again. At first, it felt like Becca Fitzpatrick had just conveniently forgotten this whole plot line. Just like in a scene where poor Patch laments the fact the has no sense of touch and can't feel Nora's kisses, but on the next page touches her cheek and remarks that she feels cold ( fuck sake ). But no, Nora actually going ahead and possessing a fallen angel is never mentioned...until it serves as the crux of the entire series. She possesses Dante (bad guy all along, who would have guessed!) in order to kill him...and that somehow makes all the fallen angels except Patch die as well (devilcraft, because shut up). All is well. Nora and Patch get married and have endless facenoms. BFF Vee Sky is revealed to be Nephilim for absolutely no reason whatsoever and Scott dies. Such a shame, he was so ineffectual in this series, I shall miss him. That's the series. And the moral of the story? Possession is inherently wrong, so the good guys give the evil-possessing guys a taste of their own medicine and possess them right back. And live happily ever after. Huh. I guess it does sum up how fucking terrible war is after all. Except what are we left with? Thousands of readers who didn't get it. Thousands of readers who truly believe that this series is actually a fantastic piece of literature. After four books, four reviews, countless rage, and tears wept for the sake of humanity, this is where it ends. Becca Fitzpatrick, either educate yourself or get the fuck out of the publishing industry. Friends, I hope my anger amuses you. Fans of the series.......uuuuuggghhhhhh...

In the previous book, Silence, Nora swore an oath that if Hank Miller (aka The Black Hand and her dad) died, she'd take his place as leader of the Nephilim race. And, naturally, he died so she became the leader. So in Finale Nora is to lead the Nephilim army to war against the fallen angels, which also means against Patch (aka fallen angel and love of her life).

And, naturally, he died so she became the leader. So in Finale Nora is to lead the Nephilim army to war against the fallen angels, which also means against Patch (aka fallen angel and love of her life). Naturally, she doesn't want to do this, so she and Patch devise a plan: lead everyone to believe they are no longer together and while Nora tries to convince the Nephilim not to fight the fallen angels, Patch would be finding out as much as he can about the fallen angels' plans, stopping the war before it even begins. But even the best of plans turn astray and when Nora finds herself with a supposed friend turned into unexpected enemy, and an troubling addiction to deal with, it leaves her unprepared for her most frightening journey yet... It's done. Patch and Nora's story is finished and I'm more than bit sad about that. Although, I must say it ends well and I don't find myself wishing there was another book so I guess that means it's completed. (view spoiler) [It's sad that Scott dies as he was one of my favourite characters and I wish that we could have gotten to know the guy Vee marries three years later although I guess that's not really all that important. At the beginning of the book I liked Dante and when I found out he was the guy being all evil I was rally upset but he turned out to be a bit of a dick so I don't mind so much anymore and I'm glad Nora kicked his ass. (hide spoiler) ] Overall I enjoyed this book, yet it's not my favourite in the series. Oh, and Nora totally changes. She goes from sweet protective Nora to manipulative ass-kicking Nora. I actually think I liked the earlier Nora more, it seemed more HER - just saying. ...more The last book of the Hush Hush series, so many wonderful memories, so many unforgettable scenes, so many tears, laughs, and shocks...I will never forget this series for all it was worth.

It was the perfect ending! I was completely hooked on every single word The last book of the Hush Hush series, so many wonderful memories, so many unforgettable scenes, so many tears, laughs, and shocks...I will never forget this series for all it was worth. My journey with this series was one I enjoyed very much and I hoped would last forever, but alas, all good things have to come to an end....but at least Becca Fitzpatrick knew how to make a lasting impression with her fourth and final book. It was the perfect ending! I was completely hooked on every single word and something intense was happening in all parts of the book. Not one word or sentence could be overlooked or ignored as it was vital to the story. Of course, because the book was so capturing and flowed very well, it would\u2019ve been impossible to have missed anything in it. The characters were much more developed, there was definitely a growth in the amount of action from the first book to this one, the romance was off the grill, and of course there was some humor, but not a lot (the only sad part about the books). But leaving aside all that, my favorite part was the development of the plot. I loved that each book led up to the grand \u2018finale\u2019 in the last one; it made for the series to be more suspenseful. As I said before, the characters were much more developed in this book, especially Nora. I\u2019m actually quite proud of how much she\u2019s grown from the first book until now. Although she didn\u2019t do a complete transformation and become a complete of the rockers bad-ass, she\u2019s certainly not the shy and introverted girl that she was in the first book. She\u2019s now more determined to protect herself and others and tries to do her best in order to help save man-kind (as it is all up to her now, ha ha). Although, I\u2019m not saying I completely loved her in this book, she did make some stupid decisions like always, but she wouldn\u2019t be Nora without her terrible decision-making skills. My favorite part about Nora in this book was that she tries to take leadership and she doesn\u2019t back down even with tons of hard-ass fallen angel dudes leaning over her shoulder at every chance. Knowing her, I thought she would\u2019ve peed in her pants, but she definitely proved me wrong. I feel like my love...ok...that\u2019s a bit extreme....maybe, great like, for Nora has grown over the series alongside her strength. Patch...*sigh*...oh sweet, sweet, sweet Patch. You will always be one of my most favorite book boyfriends and I well never ever forget you or your charm and witty one-liners. Without Patch, to be honest, half this series would\u2019ve just been a joke. In Finale, I didn\u2019t much like the fact that Patch was absent for a great deal of the story. Yes, he had his troubles and Nora had hers, but I wish he was in here just a tad bit more..yah know? Just a tad. But other than that, I still loved him in this book just as I have loved him since his and Nora\u2019s first meeting. He was protective, bad-ass and funny...basically...amazing! Patch and Nora\u2019s relationship in this book was off the charts people! They had to stage a break-up (which was one of my favorite scenes in this book...hilarious!) in order to get the Nephilim to believe that Nora is 100% on their side, but they still had secret rendezvous\u2019 and shared secret love scenes hot enough to lift a thousand hot-air balloons into the sky. Aside from them, all the other characters were great! I loved Scott in this book way more than the others as he tried to help Nora when she was in trouble. Even the others, such as Marcie and Debra who were as annoying as ever, added to the amazingness that this book was. All in all, I\u2019m glad that Fitzpatrick decided to create a fourth book (unlike many other people) because I\u2019m not sure I was ready to leave this series yet. Who cares if it was originally a trilogy? All I know is that I enjoyed it a great deal and was very satisfied with the ending. Props to you Miss. Fitzpatrick, for creating a hooking and entertaining series. ...more It was a pretty damn awesome end, but I did have a few issues with certain plot points, though.

But when I click on the link, thinking everything's all cool beans and stuff, and what should appear? Images of a slightly hilarious looking cat (Yeah, I thought it was funny, kudos to you and whatever, but I disagree completely) animated screams and eye rolls (Yeah, I'm calling you OUT, Nicki Manaj) and other screen shots and clips of famous people being surprised. And it was approximately then when I wanted to cry. Gosh, some of you people can be cruel. No disrespect or anything (well, at least maybe a bit...) but what is wrong with you? I did spy a comment as I traveled down the list from a miss Lauren Cawdell-I honestly couldn't have agreed more with her. Like, really guys. BECCA FITZPATRICK CAN READ THESE COMMENTS. Haters, I honestly don't understand why you're here. Do you understand it? I don't. I really don't. And I have my reasons... 1) If you have this huge issue with her writing, you wouldn't have continued after book 1 (It's called Hush, Hush, 'case some of you people forgot)It happens all the time. A series doesn't hold your interest so you stop reading. It happens to me! I couldn't blame you if this book isn't for everyone because you CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE. Hate to break it to you. But she's got more than enough people on board with this series, so that's VERY good ( COUGH, COUGH New York Times Bestseller COUGH, COUGH 2) Why the heck did you care enough to come here if you didn't think you'd like it before you read it? You know absolutely nothing about this book yet and you are all already hating it like its the next 9/11. You have no reason to hate it. You all just keep going on \"WHY WRITE ANOTHER ONE?!\" and what not (Most of it involves extremely colorful language) I guess there's like this whole cult of you people out there called the BOOK FOUR HATERS, cause I see you any where that says (#4) in the title. If you should be in that group of people, just don't click on that title and walk away. 3) You probably read the last three books. I'm assuming most of you have, at least. So you had to have either been expecting a sequel or wanting one. There was a bit of a cliffhanger in Silence with the whole All I had to do now was decide my opponent business. And I could say a lot more, but that would be a spoiler. And if you weren't expecting a sequel, you probably want one. You'd want to hear more of Patch and Nora's story. (If you don't know who they are, you are in the wrong place and EXTREMELY LOST.)Because most likely after reading the third book, you are willing to read more! 4)You've given absolutely no evidence as to why this book will suck. I'd bet my money it won't. You haven't gone and pointed out any real evidence that Finale won't be good. All you people have done is go and complain. You all whine about it. Are you getting to lazy to read 400 pages? 400 pages that are actually worth your time. Like you all just hate that she's writing another, but you don't really say why. You're peeved they're calling it a saga? Egads, call the police! It's a CRIME!!! (that was sarcastic, for those who didn't catch my drift) You're upset she's stretching out the story? Well, as I had probably stated earlier and will state again, if you truly loved this series you'd be totally ecstatic with that!!! Some of you hate the title. YOU TRY TO COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE!!! I will take this time to point out some of the lovely things I spied as I scrolled down the comments page... A Rendition of THREW IT ON THE GROUND by the Lonely Island, set into a hate-form. This took some creativity. I was walkin' through the Chapters store. And a man walks up to me and hands me the latest \"Hush Hush\" book. \"New book, really awesome.\" Man, I'm not going to let you poison me. I THREW IT ON THE GROUND! You must think I'm a JOKE! I ain't gonna be part of this SYSTEM! Man, give that book to some other Mary Sue! ... At my high school with my so-called friend She hand me her book. Says its Hush Hush. \"Man, this ain't a book! This is a sad excuse!\" I THREW IT ON THE GROUND! What, you think I'm stupid? I'm not a part of this SYSTEM! PATCH IS A RAPIST! DUH! ... Some poser hands me Hush Hush at my birthday party. \"What do you want me to do with this, read it?\" HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE GROUND! I THREW THE REST OF THE SERIES TOO! Welcome to the real worl poser! So many books, to throw on the ground. Like Hush Hush Crescendo Silence And even this one! ...See? Creative. Hating the whole series, for reasons like \"Patch is a rapist\" and yet...you still continued to be here after this hate fest. Yeah, smart... You can read the rest later under the full comment, but you'll ave to find it yourself. A new award...??? Congratulations, Fitzpatrick! You won the Troll Award ...Dude. Trolls are cute, and Mrs. Fitzpatrick has something to be proud of. A fantastic series. And you prob. couldn't write a better one. Wow... \"I seriously doubt I'm going to read this.\" ...Why come here then, smart one?! The real reason why most of you are upset...Maybe. \"...idiotic girls screaming for the next Edward and Bella\" Ah. So the truth comes out. Bringing it full circle to Twilight. Man, you people just can't stop hating these books. Well, you wanna know why people keep reading those sappy love stories? Because we are tired of asking \"WHERE. IS. THE. LOVE?!\" You people just have to try to kill people's creativity that they've expressed through their writing.That's right. You're all just killing that thing called imagination. (How many of you are remembering Spongebob doing that rainbow thing in that one episode?) Spongebob was created from imagination. As was Twilight. And Harry Potter. And Hush, Hush. So was your favorite TV show. And your favorite shirt. Anything you see today started in someone's head. So the next time you try to strangle the imagination that comes out of someone, just think how you'd feel if they did that to you. Writing is self expression, a way of unleashing things that you want to say. And, let me just remind you, this novel is fiction. So don't go too overboard with anything, haters. Don't let all this hate in you be created from a book. Just relax. Actually, I could go on forever about this. But, to be frank, my fingers are cramping and most of you don't care enough to read this far. You'll read the first paragraph, decide what side I'm on, and leave if you're not on my side. Well, thanks to those who are nice enough to hear me out. But now, I'd like to give this last little paragraph as a shout out to Mrs. Fitzpatrick. You're an amazing writer, I love your works, and I'm THRILLED that you're writing another book. Congratulations. I think I'm done...for now. Don't give me another reason to keep ranting, Haters. EDIT: ALRIGHT. COVER TIME. First of all. The girl looks like Kristen Stewart. This isn't hating: I personally think Kristen's beautiful. But I can't say that I really think she looks like what I envisioned Nora to look like. Oh well. I love her dress, though its not really my style, and I like the movement it shows. Very elegant and fitting for a finale. The scenery is certainly mysterious and pretty, definitely in the same spirit as the first three. Still has the same elements as the others: feathers, black and white with red accents, some sorta of light poking out of the clouds, Patch looks stiff. So, horribly posed that it's making my eyes roll back into my head. And his hair looks like Bruno Mars's. But they did keep with those famous black pants of his. Overall, the cover does seem like it belongs with the other three. All of them are dramatic and beautiful in their own way. However, this one certainly isn't my favorite--that title will always be Hush, Hush. Hush, Hush had dramatic and gorgeous elements, something that'll stay with you. I loved the red feathers on that one, Patch's angular pose, and those battered, molting wings. ...more For anyone that wants to read my melt down before the book came out, click the spoiler. :) (view spoiler) [ Okay first of all...

She wants to be with patch but will that effect her choise? Yes. im guessing that. She just killed her father but the promise still lies there in the final pages of Silence. Third, I love that Becca made a fourth book, but it could've had a better title. Seriously? Finale. It's like telling the people: HATE ME! which i don't. It could have had another volume term like QUIET! Duh! Get the point? Fourth, STOP POSTING BAD COMMENTS ABOUT FINALE (HUSH HUSH ALTOGETHER). I know it was supposed to be a trilogy, but authors some times change their minds. This book inspired me to start becoming an author and i'm still a teen. If you read the other books and didnt like them why go to this book and post bad reviews IF IT HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET? I know this is kind of like other books: Couple meet. Second: Break up. Third: Get back togther, but there is some jealousy. Fourth:Still jealousy but worked out. And a war or fight against others. Its expected but this book might be different. Nora doesnt want a war. Five, Patch isnt like any other guy in books. He is a bad-bot type and is still a bad-boy type. Even though he comes to terms and loves Nora, he still can rip someone head off if he wants to. He isnt like Edward (Twilight, i like the books but they are really girlish. and yes im a harry potter fan)or Stefan(The vampire diaries. Im on team badass. NOT HIM)they both were weak and became somewhat-badasses for the objection of their love, but that dies down a lot and then they were wimps, again. Well more with edward less with stefan. Patch stayed with his own personality. Didnt die down even for Nora. Lastly, I hope this book fits approval on my own bases. I dont want another Twilight book. And i hope this becomes a movie. Even though it has a graphic novel it would be awesome as a movie with the suspense and all. IF YOUR A HATER: GO AWAY. WE DONT WANT YOU HERE (by we i mean hush,hush readers that ACCTUALLY like it and approve of BECCA's choices with it. (hide spoiler) ] With that done. Here's my reaction to this horrifying (in a good way) book: I wanted to stab someone in the eye when I finished this book because I was pissed it was over. Things I Hate About This Book: Dante (I hate him); Scott dying (That killed me); All the kidnappings; Marcy; The last page DID IT HAVE TO END WITH A CHEESY LINE? Seriously?! \u201cYou dress to impress,\" I said approvingly. \"No, Angel.\" He leaned in, his teeth softly grazing my ear. \"I undress to impress.\u201d That pissed me off. How about a kiss to finish it? Things I like: The suspense; PATCH <3; Scott PATCH & SCOTT I LOVE YOU! So, goodbye Hush,Hush. I hope you are turned into the best movie ever. *Sobs* Now, Im going to hate everything for the series ending. Thanks a lot, Becca. I love you for making the books but please accept the movie rights.

Not only is it widely known that she is dating a fallen angel. Patch. Nobody understands why the black hand appointed her \"a human\" suddenly turned a Nephilim to take his place. Needless to say she is not trusted or accepted amongst the Nephilim. And this is not good because Cheshvan is approaching. (Unfortunately fallen angels do not have the ability to feel. At all, not kisses, touches, cold, hot or pain they get nothing. Cheshvan is the one time of year angels can posses the Nephilim after forcing them to swear fealty. Then and only then are they able to feel via their Nephilim vessel.) \"You have to choose Nora. You can't be loyal to us and Patch. You're making an admirable go of it, but in the end, loyalty is about taking a side. You're either with the Nephilim or against us.\" ~Dante Patch and Nora may have killed Hank but that has nothing on what they are up against now. Nora made an oath that could cost her and her mothers life if she does not lead the Nephilim against the fallen angels. Which means War, so in order to carry out the oath she must destroy all fallen angels. This is clearly not an option because she is in love with Patch. 'I'd lost Patch before, and not to be melodramatic, but death was preferable. Patch was in my life for a reason. I needed him. We were two halves of the same whole.' ~Inner monologue of Nora Nora and Patch stage a break-up to convince the Nephilim she is 100% on their side, while Patch finds out everything he can about the fallen angels plans. Nora will work within the Nephilim. Of course not everything goes as planned. In fact things take such a bad turn I was unsure how Nora and Patch would survive. \"You're a strong girl, and your mine. But strength doesn't always mean brute force. You don't have to kickass to be a fighter. Violence doesn't equal strength. Lead your army by example. There's a better answer to all this. War isn't going to solve anything, but it will tear our two worlds apart, and there will be casualties, including humans. There's nothing heroic about this war. It will lead to destruction unlike anything you have ever seen.\" ~Patch to Nora Thoughts Lots of twist and turns in this book. We get a few new characters and Dabria makes some annoying appearances. Seriously, I hate that chick. Marcie was... well Marcie. And Vee really stepped up, I wish we could have gotten a little more of her. While I personally would have liked some more romance I still was satisfied due to the plot-lines which had more twist than a damn pretzel. I quickly zeroed in on the characters and the story and was left SHOCKED quite a few times. And the ending.... I LOVED IT!!! This series has allowed Becca Fitzpatrick to carve a nice spot in YA-PNR and I will continue tot read her work. She is an author that can pull you in to her world with the snap a finger.

The first time I read Hush, Hush back a couple years ago, I fell in love with it. Over the years, we've had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that this series is my favorite paranormal romance out of all. It may not be the best, but I loved it. And to see it end really saddens me. The previous book, Silence , kind of disappointed me so I was really hoping that the last book would be better. And it was. There were a lot of shocks and many secre Wow. It's actually over. *sighs* What a journey. The first time I read Hush, Hush back a couple years ago, I fell in love with it.

And to see it end really saddens me. The previous book, Silence , kind of disappointed me so I was really hoping that the last book would be better. And it was. There were a lot of shocks and many secrets were revealed. And even though I had forgotten a lot of the details, I didn't have a problem continuing the story. However, the middle of the book really dragged along. I got a bit bored. Even when something did happen, I wasn't all excited. But the best parts were when the secrets were revealed - I had my theories, and some of them turned out to be true. As for Nora...*sighs*. Again, I found her annoying here. No surprise. I mean, I love her and all, but sometimes she can be really selfish and hotheaded. What bothers me the most about her is the way she treats her enemies. I'm really glad she's not one of those characters who sit back and let others walk all over her, but the way she talks back to them and the things she says don't make her sound any better than them. She sounded really bitchy when she was going off on Marcie or Dabria. True, they're not exactly nice people and have done some very bad things to Nora, but I wished that Nora didn't have to act that way as well. Even when it wasn't Nora's fault, some of her actions and decisions still bugged me. She changed a lot since the beginning of the series, but not all changes were good. But what I do like about Nora is her determination to do the right thing, even when she's terrified to do it. Also, she was pretty badass there at the end. And Patch. Wow. I really wished that this series continued, just so I could read more of his smexiness. I know that I'm definitely gonna go over the whole series and re-read his parts. *grins* Oh yeah, and also... (view spoiler) [SCOTTIE THE HOTTIE DIES. WHAAAAAAT?! I had started to like him more and more and I especially liked his brother-sister relationship with Nora. And when he died...I was really shocked. I wanted him and Vee to stay together! Oh well. At least he died a hero. (hide spoiler) ] So long, Hush, Hush series. It was a great ride. One that I'll never forget. 3.5/5 ...more I haven't yet read the third, but I'm kind of hoping Patch has already drowned Nora in the ocean at this point (otherwise the cover has lied to me). In that case, since this does not yet have a title, this book should be called 'Sunk'. You know, after Nora's ass.

Can their love survive a seemingly insurmountable divide. And in the end, will there be enough trust left to rebuild what has been broken? The lines are drawn - but which sides are they on?\" So in other words, Fitzpatrick, you're still out of ideas. Just masturbating to the same old abuse/glorified rape/glorified creep-and-general-disgusting-assface fantasy over and over again, and this book is the aftermath of such. Yep, yep, yep. Oooookay. So Nora is gushing over Patch pretty much the same way she's always been gushing over him. And Patch is the one for her, fallen angel or not. Yep, conveniently skipping over the rapist-in-the-making aspects as usual. Big challenge, stuff happens, we all know how it's gonna end, no one cares, the end. I still demand that everyone dies, and I still demand that Patch just lives up to this image on Silence and fucking sinks Nora's ass in the ocean. I am disappointed that, alas, it did not get called 'Sunk'. UPDATE 11/7/12 The cover is out, and it clearly depicts Nora about to jump off a cliff. Nora is about to jump off a cliff. Nora about to fucking JUMP OFF A CLIFF. ...more My opinion on Nora during this entire book: Go ahead, Nora. Ignore everyone's advice.
