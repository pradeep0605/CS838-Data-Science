She thinks random people would start reading at the 3rd book without reading the previous ones, and in the process of her 'introductions' she pisses her actual readers off. I feel like throwing up, (seriously) every time I read the Twins talking. It's like this author is starved of ideas for their dialogue. They, Damien, Jack, Zoey have all failed to develop in the slightest. Their banter is really getting on my nerves. I've read other reviews on this site and many are saying the same thing. Why not try some different dialogue for a change? Recognize that your readers, since they've been reading a book with the 'F' word in it and sexual content, they aren't little children who can't take big vocabulary words and who have to have repetition thrown at them, as well as stupid pop culture references every few seconds. Zoey,<---M> the main character</---M>, could use a bit of maturing. It doesn't help that the first three books progress over the time span of only a few months and she is still a freshman (third year former) in her school. Since she has such wonderful powers you would think she would learn a bit of responsibility and sense. As for her three boyfriends, you would think she would have a bit of sense and compassion to not cheat around.<---F> But noo, hormones took over</---F>. This did add some much needed conflict to the story, but the whole concept was just 'ugh' since she was fooling around with three guys at once. (great message for little girls there!) The characters I have to compliment are Stevie Rae, Aphrodite, and Neferet.They have developed and Stevie Rae's change into an undead creature was interesting, as well as Aphrodite's character development. A good thing about this series (possibly the only reason I kept on reading) is the action. It happens too fast in places, but the whole concept of the Priestess, blood drinking/imprinting, etc is very good. I also enjoyed many of the action scenes, but as the books went on they became less and less. It's a shame the good in this book is overridden by the bad writing and characterization as well as the author's laziness in thinking up new plots and character development. I'll keep on reading them, but I won't stop wishing that there was an improvement. ...more I had a crazy idea last night. I decided that I would go to the library and read Hush, Hush, House of Night, Fallen, Evermore and its sequels, and Shiver. After hearing several bad reviews for each of these books, I avoided them. But curiousity got the better of me and I couldn't very well complain about how much the standards for YA novels have fallen without reading some of the alleged best sellers. My plan was foiled and the only book they had available was the third book in the House of Nigh I had a crazy idea last night. I decided that I would go to the library and read Hush, Hush, House of Night, Fallen, Evermore and its sequels, and Shiver. After hearing several bad reviews for each of these books, I avoided them. But curiousity got the better of me and I couldn't very well complain about how much the standards for YA novels have fallen without reading some of the alleged best sellers. My plan was foiled and the only book they had available was the third book in the House of Night series, <+++>Chosen</+++>. Maybe I should be grateful. If the quality of those other books are anything like <+++>Chosen</+++>, I fear for my sanity. I have not read the first two books in the House of Night series, but I could gather what was going on. Zoey's best friend Stevie Ray is undead or something and she tried to kill Zoey's boyfriend/Imprint, Heath. Zoey's rival Aphrodite (who is much more likeable than Zoey despite being her rival) saved him. All this is told to me within two pages. The book starts off by Zoey trying to see how many times she can say suck while complaining about her awful birthday. Her birthday is near Christmas, which means that everyone does the cliche thing and gives her Christmas themed gifts. Zoey whines to her kitten about how she'll have to put on a fake smile while people give her lame presents she doesn't like. She makes a few stereotypical remarks regarding her gay friend Damien while she opens her presents. There's a notable scene when Zoey's boyfriend Erik gives her a really pretty necklace and she's estastic until she sees it has snowmen on it. That just ruins the present. Then Zoey's first boyfriend Heath gives her a bracelet and she's happy. Erik and her friends get mad that Zoey acted like an ungrateful bitch, and she has the audacity to say that it's not her fault. Zoey, it is your fault, sweetie. You didn't tell your friends you didn't like Christmas themed gifts for your birthday. You were too busy whining about having sucky birthdays to mention this fact. Just say casually, \"I don't like Christmas themed things for my birthday!\" Make light of the fact! There's no need for you to make it into a scene where you confessed you were abused. So Chosen follows Zoey's struggle to help her best friend Stevie Ray regain her humanity. I can tell Zoey just misses Stevie Ray so much. Without Stevie Ray, Zoey has to have bad birthday presents! You see why she needs Stevie Ray in her life? Saving your best friend from a bad birthday- that's a real friend. The whole thing with Stevie Ray goes back and forth. Zoey insists that she hasn't changed, Stevie Ray says she isn't human anymore, blah,blah,blah. What's Zoey's reason for Stevie Ray to be human? The clothes are better. That's right. Never mind that her best friend is losing her humanity and chomping down on humans- the important thing is that Stevie Ray looks gross as a feral vampire and her victims might have lice. Teenage priorites. Gotta love them. There's also tension with Zoey's rival Aphrodite joining Zoey's group of friends because she has an affinity for earth. I liked Aphrodite.I liked how she was trying to make up for past mistakes. I liked her bitchy attitude, her insults towards Zoey showing not everyone worshipped her, and the fact that she gave Zoey a dose of reality. Not every girl who has sexual desire is a ho. Now, that brings me to my next issue. Zoey is fond of using the word ho. The words ho and slut are tossed around a lot these days, and not in the right context. Zoey seems to think that having any sexual desire whatsoever makes you a ho. Zoey is a filthy hypocrite. One of her other problems is that she has three boyfriends. There's her old boyfriend Heath who she imprinted on and now shares some sort of sexual bond. There's her current boyfriend, Erik, who understands her. There's her Professor Blake, or Loren, who is a man that makes her feel like a woman. For a good bit of the book Zoey goes around kissing Loren and then feeling guilty and whining about it. Of course she never does anything to stop it. Then she still has feelings for Heath as proven when she basically humps him in public. But she's not a ho. Just saying. But the clincher comes at the end of the book. Zoey's crying because Erik's been Changed and it reminds her of when Stevie Ray died. I'm not too sure on the details, at that point I only had thirty pages to go. Anyway, Zoey runs into Loren and he comforts her. He takes her to his dorms- apartments- I don't know, nor do I care. The main thing is that they form an Imprint, which overrides Heath's imprint. Imprints make you feel sexual desire and she and Loren have sex. Zoey wakes up the next morning and describes herself in the most vain way ever. The little issue of Erik crops up, not to mention that she still hasn't dumped Heath, but Loren goes all possessive and says Zoey belongs to him. That's what I like to see! Possessive boyfriends! If I wanted to read this \"you belong to me\" crap, I'd go read fanfiction. There's plenty of that possessive mates/bond crap floating about. But oh no, Erik comes and see Zoey naked with their Professor. What follows is my favorite moment of the book and Erik's crowning moment of awesome to me. He calls Zoey a slut, accusing her of playing all innocent and virginal while she's been seducing her Professor. He calls her out on being a hypocrite and then says what a fool he was to have fallen in love with her. Then Zoey finds out that Loren was using her and he's in love with the baddie, Neferet. Who didn't see this coming? I've read the same plot in countless fanfictions. Some shit happens, something about Stevie Ray and some people who are supposed to combat the threat of religious fanatics. Zoey's friends find out that she cheated on Erik. Do they reprimand her for it? No, they just talk about how fiine Loren is. When Erik is still understandably upset, Aphrodite makes a remark that people take an incredibly long time to get over things that happened before. Yes, Erik, how dare you not forgive your girlfriend for cheating on you within an hour? She can get away with that shit; she's a main character. Stevie Ray comes, it's a trap, I don't know. At this point I just wanted the fucking book to end. Stevie Ray is back to normal(which means she can plan decent birthday parties for Zoey, yay!) and Aphrodite is human. The stereotypical religious group that Zoey's stepfather runs, kills Loren, so the vampires are declaring war. I was going to go into a mini-rant about how parents are the worst thing ever next to Christians, but I don't have the energy. There's a wonderful scene when Neferet tells Zoey how much she sucks. I hope Neferet kills her. But since this series is twelve books as far as I'm aware, nothing can kill Zoey. To quote Yugioh the Abridged Series- she's a main character! Everyone else can go right ahead and die! This book sucks. I suppose I could write down some creative similies, but I don't have the energy. My brain still has to recover. I will say that I couldn't believe that this is a bestseller. But after reading an informative book on the publishing world, now I can. Best-seller does not mean quality. It just means that the publishers haven't lost any money on this book. I don't know whether to weep for the future of YA books, or feel confident that my novel might have a fair shot. ...more The first two books in this series were pretty good. Definitely not phenomenal, but a good guilty pleasure series, like cotton candy in the world of literature. But Chosen was just too much. It starts off a month after Betrayed left off. Zooey is juggling three boyfriends, trying to keep the fact that Stevie Rae is a monster a secret, and struggling with the fact that her former mentor, Neferet, is an evil vampyre creating an undead army. First off, the thing that bothered me most about the book The first two books in this series were pretty good.

Zooey is juggling three boyfriends, trying to keep the fact that Stevie Rae is a monster a secret, and struggling with the fact that her former mentor, Neferet, is an evil vampyre creating an undead army. First off, the thing that bothered me most about the book was the racism. P.C. and Kristin Cast are always writing about characters' skin color, but ONLY WHEN THEY'RE BLACK. If a character is black the authors always mention it in great detail, but if the character is white or anything else, they leave discussions of their ethnicity alone. The most offensive and racist part of the book was when Zooey was (innappropriately) grinding one of her boyfriends, Heath, in public. The line, \"two black guys were just a few feet away... wearing the stereotypical ridiculous sagging pants,\" was used. This line pretty much sums the scene up. The authors stereotype black people, making these black guys vulgar, wannabe hoods. And then Zooey kills these guys for talking trash to her, and nothing much is made of it later on in the book. It's as if the authors are saying it is somehow okay to murder blacks, and that if you do there won't be any consequences. This made me really mad. Revealing the race of two characters who were only in the story for two pages was completely unnecessary. The scene could have worked regardless of the two guys' ethnicity, and the Casts identifying the two men as black sent a loud and clear message: black peoples' lives are meaningless. The character Zooey is a horrible role model. She and her friends constantly bully a girl on campus, their only reason being they deem her a slut. The girl, Aphrodite's, only crime was sleeping with a boy she'd been in a long-time relationship with! Then Zooey turns around, has three boyfriends, lies to all of them, and sleeps with a teacher. The fact that Zooey, the main character and supposed heroine of this series, sleeps with a teacher is disgusting beyond words. It shows her complete lack of good judgement and her willingness to betray her perfectly nice, loyal boyfriend Erik. I hate how Zooey manipulates the boys in her life and has no regard for anyone's feelings but her own. She lies to all her friends throughout the book and tries to have three boyfriends at once instead of doing the responsible thing and breaking up with two of them. Besides the fact that the main character is an obnoxious slut and the book is blatantly racist, the story just suffers from poor writing. The authors waste a lot of time giving us long summaries about what happened in the previous books, and sometimes review things that just happened a few chapters ago! There were also a lot of little typos throughout the book, which detracted from the story becuase it was like they were in such a rush to get the book published they didn't leave time for editing. Most of the characters are not fully drawn, and all Zooey's friends are stereotypes. There's Erin and Shaunee, two loud-mouthed girls who are tough as hell, but love to shop for shoes! There's Damien, who is the smart gay guy who holds them all together. In truth, the only thing this book had going for it was the suspense. Every chapter ended in a cliffhanger and the storyline of teachers at the House of Night showing up murdered compelled me to read on. But not even mediocre plotting can save a sinking ship. To conclude: don't waste your money buying this. Don't waste your time reading it. ...more I HATED this book more than I think I ever hated any other book in my life. Zoey is an annoying slut. The Twins are dumb bitches. Don't get me started with the love interests. Zoey thinks that anybody who has even a small dose of sexual desire is a hoe-bag, but yet throughout the series she had seven boyfriends (I kid you not). Talk about hypocritical, bitch.

I strongly disliked Erik, Heath, and Loren. But Erik won me over at the scene when he called Zoey a stupid slut and a filthy hypocrite, among a bunch of other things. At this point in the book, I'm rooting for Erik to dumb her sorry ass and find someone who might actually treat him right. The one good thing about this shit was Aphrodite. I loved her sarcastic bitchy self, but unfortuanately, she was shamed by Zoey as a slutty hoe. And yet, in the first 3+ books, APHRODITE WAS NEVER REALLY DATING ANYONE. That was enough to make me want to barf out my lunch. I am not, in any way, joking when I say that Zoey is the most hypocritical, stupid, irritating, slutty, bitchy protagonist I have had ever had the misfortune to read about. Hell, she makes Bella, Luce, Nora, and Ever look like beautiful, amazing, well-thought out characters. If I ever see Zoey on the streets, I won't think twice to wring her neck, because I have never heard of a more useless, retarded character before. ...more CHOSEN was a long-drawn out account of <---C>Zoey Redbird</---C> dealing with ( in her own words ) her ho -ish existence.

Along the way she has to keep secrets from her nerd-herd and rely on the reluctant assistance of foe-turned-friend, Aphrodite . A Series-filler with minimal truly gripping moments. ...more This book has the worst grammar of any published novel I have ever read. Whoever edited this should be ashamed.

Down points of the novel are that every guy is described as being exactly the same. They're all perfectly gorgeous without a flaw or even different personalities. The homosexual characters are flat stereotypes. And, having a young adult book in which a teenage character makes out with a teacher is just plain wrong. The incident is described as being exciting and not bad at all. Huh? Why encourage pedophilia? The story didn't need this twist as the lead character is already dating several different guys at the same time. Why not put forth a stronger female character who puts her time into a healthy relationship? Could've been much better without the ridiculous relationship with a teacher, some editing, and better character development. The plot itself holds the reader's interest despite these flaws. ...more This series just keeps getting better and better. The Casts are fearless about adding new dimensions to their beloved characters. I admire the creativity of their world--it's extremely well thought out and cohesive while blazing new paths in the vampiric realm. I really can't praise this series enough. Mini Review I really hate giving bad reviews but this book truly disgusted me. I am really disappointed in P.C. and Kristin Cast. I mean honestly, do they think that all teenagers act like this because if they do, they need a reality check. Love triangles are overused but I can admit, that some writers can really do it well. This love square thing Zoey had going on was ridiculous. I mean, come on? When I read about the teacher suddenly popping up in the picture, I was so grossed out.

What happened to being faithful? What happened to loyalty? Don't Read on unless you Have Read the Book or You Will Not Be Continuing Finally, the one moment that pissed me off like never before: Zoey slept with a teacher who was using her. How freaking stupid could she be? It was so obvious he had ulterior motives, so why oh why would she just sleep with him without considering her boyfriend, her protection, and her pride? For godsakes, she gave up her virginity to some pervert and expected her boyfriend and friends to like her afterwards for keeping secrets. What is wrong with her? God, its characters like her that put me off. It sickens me to think that there people like this out there. Its like no one respects themselves in books anymore. Its disgusting. Zoey needs to get herself some self respect because her behavior is awful. Thank god I don't act like her because if I did, then I'd owe my parents a huge apology, along with the rest of the world. Rating: 1 out of 5 Stars ...more Okay let me just start by listing all the things that made this book terrible. Terrible writing. It repeated things we already knew over and over and over and over again. The gay boy thing? Taken way too far and i was not amused. And let me just say that i have never hated a main character as much as i hate Zoey. Jesus, what makes her so damn attractive that not one boy/man/guy whatever can stay away from her? NOTHING! SHE HAS THE PERSONALITY OF A WET MOP! so why does everyone want in her pants? Okay let me just start by listing all the things that made this book terrible. Terrible writing.

Im sorry but there is no excuse for what she was doing and that is lying and stringing along guys you don't even care for. Anyways, besides the crap writing and horrible morals of main characters, I adored this book. I devoured it.

City of Bones made me realize how much I love you, no matter how horrible you are--at leas the lulz is good. We are reunited with the most hateful and obnoxious group of \"friends\" on the face of the Earth on Zoey's birthday December 24th. She is not looking forward to her birthday because people always give her Christmas-themed birthday gift, which she hates. Yet she has decided not tell anyone about this loathing because she'd rather sulk. All her friends give her great gifts, including a pair of $300 boots, a cashmere scarf and an expense pearl necklace. However, she doesn't like these gifts because they all have christmas themes as therefore can only be worn around christmas. -sigh- These people have only know Zoey for two months and they are willing to spend over $400 dollars on her. She needs to stop being ungrateful. Yeah, they are Christmas themed gifts, that's because your birthday is on Christmas Eve. Either tell people not to get you themed gifts or stop bitching; your a legal adult speak your mind and stop trying to compete with Jesus. No ones going to bring you gold, frankincense and myrrh, your not that special. This self-pittying, small minded-ness is what we are stuck with throughout the entire freakin' book. But don't worry, there are serious problems going on in Zoey's life. She's got two boyfriends, one who she's imprinted on (lulz there), the other a fellow \"vampyre\" in training. However, there is also the teacher who she's emotionally screwing on the side, but I digress. Her best-friend in the whole world that she's known for two months is an rabid vampire, who does nothing but hiss and be red-eyed and the High Priestess who everyone trusts is a psychopath. The Casts opinions on everything come through in this book painfully obvious through poorly put together dialogue and nerd pandering. I mean it's just sad at times. Like when they keep going on and on about the movie 300: \"You know, 300 may be the perfect movie. It has something in it for everyone,\" I said. \"Man titties for those of us who like that. And girl boobies for those of us who like that. Plus a very large dose of heroic guy action, and who doesn't like that?\" This is the kind of stupid, poorly constructed type of crap I used to put in my fanfiction. Observe: Katara slug her arm around Toph. \"What's with the frown?\" Toph shrugged out of it. \"Nothing I just like to do it.\" Miya put her hands on her hips. \"You better be okay, because I got the tickets to go see 300.\" Toph smiled and glomped Miya. \"YOU GOT THEM?\" Miya laughed holding the girl in her arms. \"I had to sell my soul to my sister, but it was so worth it.\" Katara rolled her eyes. \"I can not believe you wanna see that blood-feast of a movie.\" \"Hello, have you met us?\" Toph said smirking. \"We have waited all our lives for this movie.\" \"We adore Sparta. Kick-ass woman, kick-ass men, that our kinda place,\" Miya finished. ------ Yes, their dialogue is at the same level as the shitty fanfiction I wrote when I was fourteen. <---A>P.C. Cast</---A> and Child keep trying to inject their own personal opinion into everything they right, which makes everything muddled. Yet, they can't seem to address the very issues in their own work! Like how Zoey can just kill two African-American men by blowing them into the street were they get hit by a truck and feel nothing, yet a book ago she thought Aphrodite keeping her visions of human tragedy of a secret was awful. Or how Zoey can just hop from Eric to Heath to Prof. Blake, justifying it every step of the way. But Aphrodite is a dirty ho' for giving a blowjob to a guy she was dating. Oh yeah, Zoey's over use of the word ho' and describing everything from blowjobs to public making out as ho'ish was getting on my last damn nerve! When she laments that she's acting \"like a ho'\" after wanting to drink blood from one of her three conquests. I wanted to just scream at my computer that if she was a ho' instead of talking shit all the time she should be out there making some money to buy her own damn birthday presents. The writing has not improved at all and the stereotypes just keep on growing: All the \"christians\" we have seen thus far have been zelots and Westboro Baptist Church imitations. The gay characters of Damien and Jake are just there to be gay and sprout out \"big words\". We are constantly being reminded of things that happened just moments ago. I mean do we seriously have to keep being reminded that Zoey has an affinity for all the elements? Really?? Shawnee and Erin are the most irritating and vile characters in this book. Neither of them have a personality although they supposedly \"share one\" and Shawnee, like Damien, exists just to be a token. Also, Zoey apparently has a brother and sister that she hasn't mentioned, called, brought up, or seen in two months. I haven't even heard her grandmother mention these supposed children. Also, Cast's constant reference to unkept hair being \"nappy\" just rubbed me the wrong way every time it was mentioned. We are supposed to feel for the relationship between Stevie Rae and Zoey, but I was just bored the whole time. Stevie Rae is not scary in the least with her hissing and red eyes. In fact that entire storyline just further shows me that Zoey only cares about certain types of people--since she doesn't even try to help the other young vampires who have turned into monsters. Nope, they can rot. It's all about Stevie Rae. That's my main problem with Zoey, she tries to seem all sweet and loving and Disney Princess-like; but she's a (to use the Twins phrase) hag from hell. Which is why I love Aphrodite: she's an equal opportunity bitch and in this book she is the only one to have any character development. She actively tries to atone for the bad things she has done in the past and remains HBIC while doing it. I worry that by her befriending Zoey that she'll lose her awesomeness. Despite all the crap, I must admit, the last hour of this audiobook had me grinning like a troll. All of Zoey's shit gets sprung: she starts fiddling with penises she shouldn't be fiddling, breaks her imprint with Heath, one of her boyfriends catches her and breaks up with her. Sad Zoey goes to her teacher boyfriend for comfort and--hoho he was using you! Then when all her friends come to comfort her Eric puts all her lies out in the and everyone hates her! It was amazing! Of course in the next book all of this will be be reversed, but I'll enjoy it while I can. I have to say that despite the horribleness of this book I had so much fun hating it. This and Evermore are a pleasure to destroy because there is just so much material to work with. I look forward to ripping the next one apart after my cleansing. No HoN review would be complete without some scenes horrible dialogue. Enjoy!: \"You know how sensitive my people are to emotions, so you may as well just give up and tell me the truth.\" I sighed again. \"You gays are freakishly intuitive.\" \"That's us: homos\u2014the few, the proud, the hypersensitive.\" \"Isn't homo a derogatory term?\" \"Not if it's used by a homo. ~ Erin Bates is a very white girl from Tulsa and Shaunee Cole is a lovely caramel-colored girl of Jamaican-American descent who grew up in Connecticut.

You guys are definitely a nerd herd.\" I heard the bathroom door open and close, so I didn't bother to tell Aphrodite that, yes, indeed, I knew exactly how geeky those movies were but that geeky could also be fun, especially when you're dorking out with all your friends and eating popcorn and talking about how totally hot Anakin and Aragorn are (I kinda like Legolas, too, but the Twins say he's way too gay. Damien, of course, adores him.) [No self respecting nerd or fan of Star Wars thinks Anakin is hot!!!!] ~ Two black guys were just a few feet away and getting closer to us. They were wearing the stereotypical ridiculous sagging pants and stupid, oversized down coats. ~ \"I do not think it's particularly appropriate to give accolades to Aphrodite for her being right that something is seriously wrong with Zoey.\" \"Damien, I really wish,\" Erin began. \"You'd stop with the damn Sylvan Learning Center vocab bullshit,\" Shaunee finished for her. \"Would you two cease and desist, and perhaps get a dictionary?\" Damien said primly. ~ ...more To see full review click here .

Hi, This is Zoey Redbird (yes, I know I'm amazing you can like totally stop clapping now). Smiles. I'm upset that people are using my series to get drunk. Seriously, you can't understand how amazing it is. That I am like the super-est of the super. Seriously, Wonder Woman has nothing on me. I am just amazing. How many times do I have to say that? A lot, I guess, since I keep repeating it a lot throughout my novel. Now an evil person would drink a lot to that, but you're not evil right? But if you are let me tell you why you shouldn't drink in my plight to be the bestest of the bestest. Man, in this installment of my series my life really sucks. I have three boyfriends and I complain about it a lot. It's soooooo hard to choose. Let's look at my choices: A) King Douche: Oh, Heath. We've always had this connection. And we're like perfect together because of our past even though he's has about the same IQ as a Labrador Retriever. And really does nothing that's remotely likable. Except, of course, I want his blood. B) Prince Eric: Erik is just amazing. Sure he lacks a personality, but you can always recognize him because of his Superman hair and blue eyes. He's sort of like Prince Eric on The Little Mermaid appearance and all. I think he's so pretty a lot throughout the book. You can just drink at how I'm amazing anytime I describe him. C) Mr. Mary Kay Laterno: Loren, oh Loren, my poetry teacher. He makes me blush whenever he calls me a woman. Yes, I know I'm a girl (you, pervert), but there's just something about the way he looks at me....that makes me...want him. Despite the fact he didn't really pay me the time of day until very recently. Also, so what if he's my teacher and I lose my virginity to him...it's not that big of a deal. We're meant to be. And that night...oh, it was filled of blood and passion (how romantic). Okay, so I know my relationship with Loren is taboo. I know a lot of things that go on in this book could be considered taboo. But that's what makes me so cool man. Oh, poopie, I bet that sounded lame there. And really, I don't know what's wrong with bullpoopie. You people who think I should cuss or at least act like a quasi normal human being just need to get over yourself because I'm special. So, back to what we were talking about my story is taboo, original, and edgy. Here are some of the \"edgy\" things that are discussed that have never been seen in a little fan fic called My Immortal *Student/teacher relationships: Loren and I are love. We like did it in the rec room but it was totally ruined by Prince Eric who came in there and started cussing us out. *Count Chocola and vampires love for it (if I only I could have a Mercedes with the license plates with 666) *Friends that undergo radical transformations with makeovers that are from Hot Topic (Um, maybe not the Hot Topic part, but I so wish Stevie Rae would get rid of those Wranglers) *Evil teachers who hate me for no reason See, totally original. Totally. I am unique like a unicorn. But better because I'm Zoey Poopie Redbird. I'm not afraid to stand up to the issues and defend my friends. And yeah, I sort of talk bad about them behind their back. Like Stevie Rae, I totally agree with Aphrodite (that biotch) that she needs a makeover. But whatever. I'm still a good person. Even though that was sort of mean, blowing those two random guys in front of a truck to get ran over and then blowing it off because of happy hour at Starbucks. But they didn't die. Besides, I'm totally a caring individual. Look at how I take care of Damien. He's gay and I'm totally okay with that. I love him, even though he's characterized so stereotypically at least according to cynics. And so what if he got with the only other gay kid in school it was true love Nyx meant it be. And I so don't know why people have a beef with Nyx. She's our one true goddess. If you worship anything else your a fanatic or freak. Like my mother. I so don't understand why she sent me a Christmas card. I hate Christmas it always ruins my birthday. Bullpoopie Birthmas gifts. Whatever. So by now, you know that I'm a totally cool person and one you don't have to get drunk to have fun with. I mean, surely you can't find anything worth drinking over from what I said, right?

He was okay in the first book, and in the second one, we didn't hear from him much, but in this one, he was dreadful. Aphrodite started to warn Zoey about how Erik was, but Zoey ignored all the red flags Aphrodite threw her way, and let all arguments go down. Good Gods, Zoey is annoying as Hell. So, I like Aphrodite now. She is my new favorite. The Twins are awesome, but come on, Aphrodite is much more realistic. She is dark and depressing, sarcastic, which are all things I love in a book character. Especially the sarcastic part. I loved her. She used to be a major bitch, truly, but now she's not to bad. OMG, I missed Stevie Rae so much! I cannot word on how much I missed her! She is really the best. I love her Okie accent and how she loved Kenny Chasney (? I dunno, who..) But it was all terrible. How she was that weird ass ghost vampire thing. Hopefully there will be a name for that weird shit later. Anyway, there is not much I can say about this book, just that it seems that it is worse than the other books. ...more I just read a review of this book that says it has the worst grammar of any book ever published and that the editors should be ashamed. That is probably the real reason I continue to read this series. I would like to see how much worse it can get. I never thought I would read a more poorly written story than Jean Auel's The Shelters Of Stone, which read like a NaNoWriMo novel that never got fleshed out. But I was wrong.

The librarian asked me if this was \"one of those Twilight books\" and although I turned up my nose as I said \"no,\" I have to admit that the Twilight series is like Shakespeare compared to this. I can't wait to read this, knowing that it will--no pun intended--suck. This review is probably not helpful, considering I haven't read the book yet and I'll probably forget to update it when I'm done. Update: Boo.

Then I cleared my throat and continued in an overly perky voice. \"And it's okay not to be like anyone else.\" I rolled my eyes at myself. \"Whatever.\" When I first started on the House of Night series back in January, I was warned by a friend that, while the first two books were indeed terrible, they had nothing on the third, Chosen . So, after reading Marked and Betrayed , I couldn't possibly believe my friend's words. How could it get w \"You're not like anyone else,\" I whispered to my reflection. Then I cleared my throat and continued in an overly perky voice. \"And it's okay not to be like anyone else.\" I rolled my eyes at myself. \"Whatever.\" When I first started on the House of Night series back in January, I was warned by a friend that, while the first two books were indeed terrible, they had nothing on the third, Chosen . So, after reading Marked and Betrayed , I couldn't possibly believe my friend's words. How could it get worse ? Now that I have finished, I can safely say that my friend was not lying. Chosen really is worse than the first two books combined . The book picks up shortly after where Betrayed left off. Nothing has really happened in the series except for Zoey -sue becoming MOAR SPESHUL with each passing volume, and the reveal of what I assume is the big-bad, Neferet, who was originally portrayed in the first book to be Zoey's cool vampyre mentor. This book focused mainly on three things; Zoey's friend 'Stevie-Rae' being not-quite-dead ( which we already knew at the end of the last book ), the beginnings of some sort of semi-religious conflict between vampyres and humans, and Zoey's tumultuous love-life. Love-triangles? Not good enough for our Zoey! We need a love- square ! Usually, I'd be all for this; I love reverse-harems. I'm writing my own young adult novel with a reverse-harem. The more guys the merrier! But I absolutely hated Zoey's love issues. Why? Because I hated Zoey. For me to enjoy a YA romance, I have to like the characters involved. I can disagree with them, but I have to like them. I can't throw myself into supporting a relationship between two characters I just don't give a flying fuck about. This is the reason I can't enjoy the relationship drama Zoey has with Erik/Heath/Loren. I hate Zoey, I don't care about Erik, Heath annoys me, and Loren downright horrifies me . Right from the start, Zoey proves that she hasn't change from the insufferable, hateful person she was in the last few books. Her birthday is coming up, and since it's on the 24th of December it's common for people to get her 'Christmas' themed presents. She calls it 'birthmas' gifts, and she hates it. Naturally, she didn't tell her friends this, and they all think getting her Christmas-themed gifts would be a cute idea. Zoey bitches about it internally but says nothing. Then they find out she hates Christmas gifts, and are appalled and saddened. She whines that it's not her fault, because she told one of her friends- but that friend is dead so, oops, not her fault. That is how the book begins. Zoey spends most of this book moaning about how awful her life is because she has three boyfriends and doesn't know what to do about them. She knows what she is doing is wrong, but she keeps on doing it anyway. We're constantly reminded by how guilty she feels, but the guilt never seems real because she doesn't do anything with it. At one point she's going to go break up with Heath, her human ex-boyfriend with whom she shares an Imprint, but instead of breaking up, he slits his arm open ( AGAIN. HE DID THIS IN THE LAST BOOK AS WELL. ) and they dry hump on the street. This leads to two \"unsavory\" characters coming up and sexually harassing them. Zoey promptly kills them. Did I mention the two \"unsavory\" characters in question were black men portrayed as stereotypical gangsters? And that Zoey barely gives half a shit about murdering them ? Now, the past few books have been racist as well, but this just threw me. How could anyone read this before publishing and think it was okay? Not to mention that the book still reminds us every time Shaunee shows up that she is black, or, \"caramel\" or \"mocha-latte\" or any other synonym. She is the only character who is repeatedly described other than the males in Zoey's harem, and those descriptions are clearly meant to be for the reader's benefit. A similar thing continues on for Damien and his boyfriend Jack Twist. We as the reader are constantly reminded that they are homosexual. And believe me, the jokes just fly in every direction. It's meant to be seen as friendly banter, but it just reminds me of bullying. There's this exchange that is so stiff and unnatural that I just have to quote it again; \"I sighed again. \"You gays are freakishly intuitive.\" \"That's us: homos- the few, the proud, the hypersensitive.\" \"Isn't homo a derogatory term?\" \"Not if it's used by a homo.\" This was five pages into the book. General online consensus says that 'homo' isn't a friendly term of endearment. It's not the homosexual equivalent of the N-word. All this exchange did was help reinforce the fact that Zoey's friend Damien is gay. He's gay. Did you know that? He's homosexual. He likes the D. He is a homosexual boy. Gay. Gay. Gaygaygay. Gay . STOP IT. THIS IS NOT HOW YOU WRITE AN INCLUSIVE CHARACTER. This is just reinforcing horrible old stereotypes that need to stop being pushed around. I don't even want to get started on Jack Twist, who is named after Brokeback Mountain and seems to have only hooked up with Damien because they're the only two homosexual males in the story and, because of their proximity, obviously must get together. Sigh. A large chunk of the book focuses on Zoey attempted to \"fix\" Stevie-Rae, who had become some kind of undead vampyre during the last book. Fixing Stevie-Rae involves hiding her in Aphrodite's house- who has now become a frenemy of Zoey's- and then doing yet another element circle at the end of the book which fixes everything . The entire plot-line was bullshit and really just felt like filler to me where it should've felt central. Instead, all the focus was on Zoey and her love life. She has several make-out sessions with a professor, Loren Blake; one make-out/groping session with her vampyre boyfriend, Erik; and a hot and heavy humping and blood-sucking sesh with her Imprinted human ex-boyfriend, Heath. In between these, she feels immensely guilty and calls herself a 'ho' multiple times. Then, near the end of the book, she has sex with the professor- thereby destroying the Imprint she has with Heath- and is caught by Erik. Erik, rightfully upset, calls her a slut. Zoey, upset, insists she isn't. Erik is then painted to be an asshole for wanting to hurt Zoey after she hurt him, and it's clearly expected that as the reader we are meant to sympathise with poor Zoey, because it turns out creepy teach' Loren was actually a spy of Neferet's who only wanted to bang Zoey in order to get information out of her. Or maybe he really did like her, but what does it matter he's dead now . Yeah. Seriously. He gets killed . So, the whole book focuses on boyfriend drama, and it ends with Zoey having zero boyfriends. The only reason I found this satisfying is because I hate Zoey . The book ends with Neferet declaring that vampyres will declare war on humans or something, and then Zoey telling Neferet that she's evil. Then she hugs her cat and says something about how things are only going to get harder from then on out. It was possibly the most ham-fisted ending I've ever read. It's like there was meant to be a cliff-hanger, but there's just a blank kind of void instead. I'm hoping that this is the worst book of the series. You know why? Because maybe it gets better. Maybe, somewhere along the line, I'll be able to give a House of Night book two stars . Because so far, I'd be giving them zero if only Goodreads would let me. Ruin, I'm doing this, baby. I'm going to do it. I'm going to read this whole series. Pray for my safe return. ...more This third installment of the House of Night series starts to feel a little preachy in its declaration of the heroine's personal values and opinions: I have, after all, listened to the exact same sentiments for three freaking books now.

Do I have to keep reading as you willfully indulge in all manner of selfish vanity and lust? Have you no self control? Maybe not. And maybe that's okay, but it definitely doesn't make me care what happens to you. And yet somehow by the end of the book, once Zoey Got Hers, I found myself still caring enough about the other characters to want to read the next book. I'm just hoping that next book brings something a little new to the table. ...more I only keep this book around because I started reading it, which means I have to finish.

Oh, garsh, I'm such a ho-bag now! Gag me. Seriously. Make this end. Nobody that age calls someone a \"hateful hag\" OK? Quit trying to make \"hag\" happen, Cast. It's not happening. Zoey is not a heroine. She is a bad role model for any impressionable teen that might read this. She feels guilty for being such a ho-bag while porking her teacher, cheating on both her boyfriends. Wow. And exactly why does everyone hate Aphrodite? Because she's a ho-bag for blowing her (ex)boyfriend? Eeewy, she put his pee-pee in her mouth. Oh my god, I almost rolled my eyes right out of my head after reading the first book. But now look at Little Miss Hypocrite, spreading em' for Mr. Teacher.

Check. \"Caramel-colored\" Shaunee? Awkward Nick-at-Nite reference to unnecessarily excuse knowing about The Brady Bunch ? Scent of hay, gust of wind, water lapping at the feet during circle casting? CHECK CHECK FUCKING CHECK AUGHHHHH. So yes, the same issues that we had with the last two House of Night books are all still present and a-fucking-ccounted for, and it would be both excruciating and redundant to revisit them here. So we're not going to talk about those this time. We're going to try to cruise through this one, and just expand on a couple of the bigger problems we had with the third installment of the House of Night series, Chosen . We have problems with this book, okay? Lots of them. Plot problems, sex problems, bad-fucking-storytelling problems, and they're all gone in to in more depth in the complete review at You're Killing Me . But if there's one thing we want to communicate most about Chosen , it's what follows: LOL RACISM It's not like House of Night has been a shining pillar of excellence when it comes to race - the series is an unabashed endorsement of stereotypes, has a fondness for Othering and exotifying Zoey's Sassy Black Friend, Shaunee, and has let loose with weave insults and \"good hair\" comments, and varying other subtly racist bullshit. But in Chosen , Cast has taken the racism to a new, disgustingly sinister level. \"Yeah, bitch! Ride him! Make him hurt so gooood!\" \"That little white boy don't have nothin' for you. I'll give ya somethin' you can really feel!\" Heath's grip on my hips changed and he was in the middle of trying to turn my body away from the jeering voices so he could shield me, but the anger that spiked through me was blinding. My fury was impossible to ignore and my response was immediate. I lifted my face from his neck. Two black guys were just a few feet away and getting closer to us. They were wearing the stereotypical ridiculous sagging pants and stupid, oversized down coats and when I bared my teeth at them and hissed, their expressions changed from sneers to shocked disbelief. \"Get away from us or I will kill you.\" I snarled at them in a voice so powerful I didn't recognize it as my own. \"She's a fucking bloodsucker bitch!\" the shorter of the two said. The other guy snorted. \"Nah, bitch got no tattoo. But if she wants somethin' to suck, I'll give it to her.\" \"Yeah, first you and then me. Her little punk boyfriend can watch and see how it's done.\" With a mean laugh, they started walking toward us again. Still straddling Heath, I lifted my one arm over my head. With the other I dragged the back of my hand across my forehead and down my face, wiping off the concealer that hid my identity. That made them stumble to a stop. Then both of my arms were over my head. It was easy to center myself. Filled with Heath's fresh blood, I felt powerful and strong and very, very pissed. \"Wind come to me,\" I commanded. My hair began lifting in the breeze that swirled restlessly around me. \"Blow them the hell outta here!\" I flung my hands out toward the two men, letting my anger explode with my words. The wind obeyed instantly, crashing into them with such force that they were swept, yelling and cussing, off their feet and hurled away from me. I watched with a kind of detached fascination as the wind dropped the two men down in the middle of Twenty-first Street. I didn't even flinch when the truck hit them. Okay, what the fuck was that. No seriously, what the fuck. Zoey just got two guys, two men who are explicitly, pointedly stated to be black men , run over by a truck. And the story lovingly describes her every action, like we're supposed to appreciate what a powerful badass she is. What the fuck? \"Did you kill them?\" His voice sounded all wrong, scared and accusing. I frowned at him. \"No. All I did was get them away from us. The truck did the rest. And anyway, they might not be dead.\" I glanced back at the road. The truck had come to a skidding, tire-squealing halt. Other cars had stopped, too, and I could hear people shouting. \"And Saint John's Hospital is like less than a mile down the street.\" Sirens started wailing not far away. \"See, the ambulance is coming already. They'll probably be okay.\" The first thing Zoey does is rationalize - they might not be dead, there's a hospital, I didn't mean to, I'm sure they'll be fine. Blah blah blah. Then: \"Heath?\" I lifted my hand toward him, but dropped it when he flinched away from me. The numbness was fading and I had started to shake. My god, what had I just done? \" Are you afraid of me ?\" Note there that the reaction isn't about what Zoey did to those men, but Heath's reaction to what she did to them. It's not about them, it's about her: why Heath, are you afraid of me because I killed two men in a rage ? His response? \"I'm okay with you being a vampyre, Zo. But I want you to remember that you're still Zoey, too. My Zoey. And my Zoey isn't mean.\" Zoey isn't mean , not \"My Zoey isn't a fucking MURDERER\". Yes Zoey, it was so mean of you to kill two men. \"I couldn't let them hurt you,\" I whispered, really shaking now as I realized how cold and horrible I'd just been. I might have just caused the deaths of two men. This is the first time we have Zoey acknowledge any sort of guilt-ish feeling over what she's done, without excusing it or tying it to someone else's perception of her. I might have just caused the deaths of two men. Okay, that's a start. Now maybe some guilt, some checking to see whether or not the men died, how injured they were, if they made it to the hospital, maybe taking some responsibility. You know, things a normal, empathetic person would do. Or she could just wander over to her best friend's house in a blood-lusty, horny haze to talk about boys. Yep, I was seriously messed up. Not only had I not broken up with Heath, but I had probably made our Imprint even stronger. Plus, I may have caused two men to be killed. I shivered, feeling more than a little sick. What in the hell had happened to me? I'd been drinking Heath's blood and having a horny old good time (jeesh, I was becoming such a ho-bag), and then those men had started messing with us and it was like something inside of me freaked and changed from Regular Zoey to Psycho Killer Vampyre Zoey. Yeah, she sounds tortured. I mean really, not breaking up with her boyfriend, killing some guys, acting like a \"ho\" - all pretty much the same on the Zoey scale of Awful Things to Do. Jesus Christ Cast, could you make Zoey's reflection on possibly causing the deaths of two men sound ANY MORE CASUAL? Clearly there was just too much vampyre stuff that I didn't know about. Hell, I'd even taken notes and memorized some of the chapter on Imprinting and bloodlust, but I was starting to see that there was lots of stuff the oh-so-educational textbook had left out. What I needed was an adult vamp. Fortunately, I knew one I was sure would be very happy to volunteer to be my teacher. I'm sure there were lots of things he'd be ever so pleased to teach me. I thought about those things, which was easy to do when I was filled with Heath's delicious, sexy blood. My body still tingled with heat and power and sensations I knew I didn't have a clue about, but I craved more of. A lot more of. There was no denying that Loren and I had a thing. It was different than the thing Heath and I had, and even different than the thing Erik and I had. Crap. I had too many things going on in my life. Basically, I floated to Aphrodite's parent's garage apartment in a kind of horny, power-filled, yet confused haze... Yeah. That's what she's thinking about. That's her train of thought after POSSIBLY KILLING TWO PEOPLE. She's HORNY. She briefly tries to blame the vampire biology books for not telling her about the possibly violent side effects of imprinting - and then goes on to more important rambling about her boyfriend problems. This is the last time that Zoey mentions the men from that night, not just for this book, but FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES: \"Professor Nola was killed last night. It looks like some of the People of Faith crucified her and chopped her head off and left her out by the trapdoor on the east wall with a lovely note about not suffering a witch to live. I think that my step-loser might be involved, but I can't say anything about it because my mom is covering for him, and if I rat him out she'll probably go to jail forever. I just sucked Heath's blood and got interrupted by some gang wannabes who I think I might have kinda sorta accidentally killed , and Loren Blake and I have been making out. So, how was your day?\" The old Stevie Rae flickered inside this one's red eyes. \"Ohmygoodness,\" she said. \"Yeah.\" \"You've been making out with Loren Blake?\" As usual, Stevie Rae got to the heart of the juiciest gossip. \"What was it like?\" Yep. You'd think that if your best friend came up to you and confessed to a possible murder, you'd be a lot more worried about that than her multiple boyfriend problems. But nope, \"OHMYGODNESS HOT FOR TEACHER\", that takes priority. What the fuck is this? No really, what the fuck is this? A person wrote this, she had her fucking PROTAGONIST experiences this, and then brush it off like it was nothing. The deaths of two men. Two black men. And that, that's the worst part, you see. They were black men. We were explicitly told that they were black men, that they were wearing \"stereotypical\" sagging pants and down jackets, and putting aside how INCREDIBLY SHITTY that is in terms of writing, lazily, flat-out labeling bit characters as stereotypes, fucking hack, let's think about what that means. Cast wants us to know these men are black - they're not white hoodlums, even though this would make no contextual difference in the story. They were stereotypical - Cast literally, specifically calls up a stereotype that her audience would likely be familiar with. Then she has her story-blessed protagonist, Zoey Redbird, kill them. And not fifteen minutes later, Zoey is daydreaming about humping her teacher, and priority in the mind of her friend is given to gossip and boys, implicitly absolving Zoey of her actions. So clearly, we're not meant to give two flying fucks about the men who just died. Cast is intentionally preying on prejudices that, at least in her mind, her audience has against black men: they're dangerous, aggressors, potential rapists, misogynists, who are not deserving of our sympathy or empathy, of our heroine's guilt; they're sub-human . And then she agrees with them . PC Cast is a MOTHERFUCKING RACIST. And she's requesting, no, requiring her reader's complicit racism. She's explicitly telling you that you don't have to give two fucks about the black guys who just died. Zoey doesn't. Heath doesn't. Stevie Rae doesn't. The story doesn't. So why should you? They were just black guys. Who the fuck cares, right? Here, shiny boy problems to worry about, forget about those two black guys PC Cast just wrote in and killed for no good fucking reason. Forget that PC Cast just outed herself as a fucking RACIST. And before you go \"But, but, they were possibly going to rape Zoey\", NO. Did they have to be black to play the role that they played? Is it any less likely that two white men would act that way in the same situation? If your answer is \"yes\", then you need to re-think your prejudices. There was NO REASON for Cast to explicitly say that they were black, no fucking reason, except to communicate her fucked-up little racist code. In short: And she doesn't think you should either. ...more So far, this has been my favorite book in the House of Night series.

What I enjoyed the most about this particular book in the series was that for the first time, in my opinion, Zoey made mistakes and there were consequences for the mistakes that she made. Zoey has been doing a pretty good job and making mistakes and people right away either forgiving her, or simply telling her that she has a lot to learn. In this book, that wasn't the case. She made mistakes, she was heart broken, and for once people didn't forgive her for the mistakes she made which makes the story seem all the more real. I love when characters make mistakes simply because we all make mistakes it's part of who we are. When Zoey made mistakes in this novel and had to deal with the consequences of those mistakes it made me, as a reader, like her more because I could relate and sympathize with her. More exciting, nerve-racking, and intense things are sure to come in the next House of Night book, Untamed. I'm not sure where it's going to go and I'm not sure how Zoey is going to deal with the things to come. But I know that I am excited to see what's in store for everyone at The House of Night! :) ...more *****You can read my full review at Darling & Co. ***** A lot happens in the 3rd House of Night book, and it all only takes course over a few days.

My hopes for the next book are that we learn more about Stevie Rae; that we figure out what the hell happened with Aphrodite; and that Zoey's friends give her a hard time about all the shit she's pulled, but they find a way to work through it and can take down Neferet. ...more I hate myself a little.

The People of Faith also seem to have decided they hate vampires, but, really the love interests are way more important My suffering continues thanks to the cruel machinations of Cyna and Mavrynthia and Merriska and I continue to battle through this series However, now I can be somewhat positive, because there are some definite improvements in this book, especially Aphrodite. So far she has portrayed in the most grossly misogynist of terms and treated as a parody of a terrible person, here we actually get to see her as a more of a person. Sure, she\u2019s not exactly a very pleasant person, but she is a person rather than a monster in human form. She\u2019s actually far more developed than Zoey\u2019s friends who are little more than mindless drones worshipping her every move. So Aphrodite finding her own personality, being involved in the plot even if it is in the path of \u201credemption\u201d for not being a good follower of Zoey in the first place. Even better, not only is Aphrodite not just a caricature of evil and awful, but she actually challenges Zoey in ways that don\u2019t just come down to her being super evil and terrible. She challenges Zoey and she may be right \u2013 and she challenges her on several levels: She pokes at Zoey\u2019s ridiculous refusal to cuss and her massive slut shaming and even demands the whole group see sense when they\u2019re busy bickering. Now we have Aphrodite as part of team good-guy which means hopefully we will continue to have a character who will challenge Zoey in the future. Another nice moment is when her friends actually challenge her over the secrets she\u2019s keeping. Sure, they\u2019re obviously wrong and mean and don\u2019t understand \u2013 but this whole series is so saturated in evil people vs sycophants that just seeing someone challenge Zoey who isn\u2019t evil personified is an amazing relief See, this is the problem with this series \u2013 it sets the bar so damn low than it is incredibly easy to be pleasantly surprised. Right here endeth my praise Like the previous books in this series, this book is sorely lacking in plot \u2013 and actual active involvement in said plot. We have three main issues du jour \u2013 Neferet, the boss of the school is apparently evil despite being a High Priestess of Nyx and Nyx not doing a damn thing about this (slacker goddess can give Zoey stomach cramps of guidance but not stop Neferet running rogue?). Secondly we have Stevie Ray, one of Zoey\u2019s sycophants, who has turned into an undead evil thing and Zoey would rather she wasn\u2019t. And then there\u2019s the love square that makes my eyes roll so much that I get friction burns. So how do these plots progress? The first one doesn\u2019t. Neferet is constantly used as an excuse to not tell anyone anything without any real indication of why that is so or how it justifies secrecy. It just is. On the second plot \u2013 nothing happens until Deux Ex addresses it. Seriously we have a whole lot of angsting and woe and worry \u2013 but every time she considers researching or actually doing something about it, she\u2019s distracted by her convoluted love interests. So she does nothing but fret until WOOO GODDESS POWER! And this is something I loathe about the plots of these books. There\u2019s no work, action or agency from Zoey or her friends \u2013 everything is decided by Nyx, the Irritable Bowel Goddess. She needs to decide whether to say anything? Divine stomach roil. Needs to solve something, goddess intervention. Needs to decide what to do? Goddess cramps. Zoey doesn\u2019t do anything in her own right, she\u2019s just a puppet being manipulated by the goddess inside. Which really does make Nyx not acting in other ways so ridiculous. Is she a hands off goddess letting her people work with free will, or is she getting in her little vampires\u2019 business and micromanaging them? And then there\u2019s the love interests \u2013 each more terrible than the last. Can someone please acknowledge that her relationship with Heath is predatory? She has \u201cimprinted\u201d on him basically making him addicted to her and crave her touch. She continues to meet with him. She refuses to break it off \u2013 she refuses to free him. She keeps going back to him, keep drinking his blood. She recognises it\u2019s wrong \u2013 but she recognises it is wrong for the wrong reasons: She is seeing it is forbidden for fledglings and humans to be together, but completely fails to recognise the control she has over him or the abusive dynamic it creates. Then there\u2019s her relationship with Loren. Now, they do finally consider this relationship to be a problem and that Loren is deceiving and manipulating Zoey with his own agenda. And yes that is certainly a problem and he is terribad awful. But it kind of misses the elephant in the room that absolutely no-one is willing to acknowledge except in a passing moment before handwaving it because Zoey is just so special and the teacher is just so hot that we\u2019re just going to ignore the whole problem of a teacher preying on one of his students. And finally we have Erik who remains the one appropriate love interest who turns into the terribad jealous slut shaming arsehole over her other boyfriends. Now, I\u2019ve already mentioned the many many many many reasons her other relationships need tearing down and, \u201cwaaah I\u2019m jealous and you\u2019re a slutwhorejezebel\u201d is not one of them. He only bright light in that relationship is, shockingly, Aphrodite who calls out exactly how self-absorbed Erik is. This is also the book where Zoey loses her virginity \u2013 and it\u2019s predatory, manipulative and takes advantage of her while she\u2019s at her most vulnerable. It\u2019s a terrible scene \u2013 and it\u2019s not made terrible by the person she\u2019s with, it would be terrible with any of the men.

And the hinting at a Cherokee legend I've never heard of before. Zoey was the most unlikable character out of all of them. She had three boyfriends, which is kind of understandable, considering the consequences and the storyline. I didn't like the grammar errors and typos, but I put up with them. The Twins, Jack and Damien were horribly cliche. I started referring I am being generous with this two stars for one reason- Aphrodite.

The Twins, Jack and Damien were horribly cliche. I started referring to the Twins as Captains Obvious because that's what they did; repeated what we, as the reader, were supposed to pick up. I can see what the Casts are trying to do with Jack and Damien, being a gay teenage couple without a lot of prejudices over their lifestyle in the way, but they were completely stereotypical gays and Jack was conveniently the tech wizard Zoey needed, which made me roll my eyes. Then there were the boyfriends-- they were all the same; smart, good-looking, supportive, and completely bland, including Heath, who magically gave up drugs and alcohol to be with Zoey without withdrawals or becoming an outcast, just because he was her imprint. Her friends were horrible to her- they got mad at her because she tried to protect their feelings by not telling them that she hated \"Birthmas\" gifts. Even I could tell you that combined birthday and Christmas gifts suck, especially for your best friends. Maybe it was pride that made them get mad at her, which I can understand. Zoey ends up needing Aphrodite's help for Stevie Rae because Neferet can't read Aphrodite or Zoey's minds, but can read her friends. They get angry with her without even knowing her side of the story, making them the world's worst friends. Zoey, stick with Aphrodite. Maybe she's a bit slutty and mean, but she's a better friend to you than the Twins, Damien and Jack. One thing that creeped me out to no end was how when Zoey went to break up with Heath and then, she almost killed a few black kids in the park. That bothered me a lot-- Zoey wasn't even that remorseful over it five pages later when she got back to the school. That's when I decided I liked Zoey the least in the whole series. I thought the first Rede of Wicca and Paganism was \"An it harm none, do what ye will.\" There was no consequence for Zoey almost killing someone. And Loren. OMG. What a creep. If Zoey's so special and smart, why did she fall for Loren Blake? If a teacher had hit on me in high school, I'd have gone running and reported them. I was screaming \"Zoey, run! He's a perv!\" Never happened, and somehow, he talked her into sex and strategically got Erik to walk in and catch them. I knew from the first exchange between Zoey and Loren that he was a creep. I felt kind of bad for Erik, for his lack of dimension. Zoey walked all over him with Heath, whom he knew about it, and... She lied to him about Loren. ...more These novels are no longer 'a little problematic' for me, they are filed under full blown 'what the hell were they thinking'. The issues I had with the slut shaming that was gradually appearing in the last two books have been pushed squarely into the light here. I don't know what I am supposed to think. Am I supposed to agree with Zoey, and believe that any expression of sexual lust makes you a ho? And if that is the case, Zoey herself is the biggest 'ho' in this book. What I want to be told, is ho These novels are no longer 'a little problematic' for me, they are filed under full blown 'what the hell were they thinking'.

What I want to be told, is how no girl, young or old, should ever have to deal with the label 'ho' or 'hag'. What I want is a open honest discussion of female sexual desire, without said female being made to look like a slut OR having been taken advantage of by an older male. I want realistic female friendships, where forgiveness is a way of life and one doesn't have to be reminded of their past constantly. It was too messy. The possibility that these books held were finally overtaken by a misguided idea of 'cutting edge'. It's clear Cast has some kind of message, somewhere. I am just not sure I actually prescribe to it myself. I'm not sure I'll be reading on in this series. Although maybe I'll try one more to find out if Zoey realises her constant slut shaming does no good for anyone, including herself. Aphrodite, as always, is fabulous. Those stars are for her and her alone. ...more San\u0131r\u0131m seriye olan ilgimi kaybettim. :( Devam etmem i\u00e7in bir taraflar\u0131m\u0131 y\u0131rtmam gerekbilir ve ben buna hi\u00e7 g\u00f6n\u00fcll\u00fc de\u011filim.", "Title": "Chosen"},
