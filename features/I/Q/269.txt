We learn quite a bit about the fascinating and horrific backstory that led to Salander developing her unique, defensive, prickly personality. \"Don\u2019t ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she\u2019ll get a bigger gun. \" But don't let the focus on Lisbeth fool you - essentially, this book should have been simply titled Men Who Hate Women, Part II ( Men Who Hate Women was the original title of the first Swedish book, before it was changed to include a more marketable dragon tattoo) as its main theme remains the same as its predecessor's, repeated and restated countless times. And that's why I liked this otherwise far from perfect book. Yet again, Larsson determinedly exposes the unlikable aspects of society - misogyny and adherence to judgmental standards and gender norms that are ever-present even in the European paradise of Sweden. The surface mystery is just that - a plot device, an excuse to get a new angle on Larsson's favorite topic. We see the various shades and sides of hatred towards women, especially if they try to get out of the bounds that society neatly places for them. This is reflected first and foremost in the awful treatment that Salander receives, but also in the treatment of Lisbeth's mother, Sonia Bodig, and the helpless and easily ignored by the society victims of sex trafficking. \"When all the media assertions were put together, the police appeared to be hunting for a psychotic lesbian who had joined a cult of Satanists that propagandized for S&M sex and hated society in general and men in particular.\" I loved the no-compromise and no-subtlety message that this book delivers on the subjects that are indeed not subtle and should not be compromised on. However, I could not help but sigh and eyeroll at Larsson's less-than-perfect prose. His books could have really benefited from the generous use of editor's red pen. (But I do understand that these books were published posthumously and therefore probably not much was cut out out of respect to the dead author.) My gripes are similar to those of many other readers - the tediousness of every minute detail, the never-ending parade of brand names reading like an ad at times, and what feels like the entire Ikea catalog making a special appearance. This diary-like filler could have been easily cut out, leaving a much shorter and much sharper book. I also giggled at the author's self-insertion and clear wish-fulfillment in the memorable figure of incorruptible and irresistible journalist Blomkvist. And how can I forget a grating pet-peeve of not getting a medical condition right: (view spoiler) [A person who does not feel pain is destined for a rather disabled existence rather than becoming an indestructible superhero. Really. You can Google that (hide spoiler) ] . The final grade is 3 stars - full marks for the awesome message of the story, but points taken off for far-from-perfect execution. \"His attitude had always been that if a woman clearly indicated that she did not want anything more to do with him, he would go on his way.

Seriously, you could go down to the store and decorate the same way if you wanted, that's the level of description he gave. I was bored out of my mind. This goes on for a staggering 172 pages. Mystery thriller? Surely you jest! This book wasn't a mystery whatsoever for me. The fact that the police and everyone else working to solve the case chose to ignore it was pitiful. The turning point didn't happen until page 172, which was about 100 pages too late to hold the interest of any reader who's not a masochist. The quick pace and interest it generates rapidly disappears until 375.Really. It was more bloated than a rotting whale. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a better book.

She kills a man on the beach during a hurricane. 3. She shuts out Blomkvist for a very long time for a perceived slight, giving him no explanation. 4. She fails to take or show the necessary care with her ex-guardian after his stroke. 5. She alienates everyone else who cares about her. 6. She lives off billions that she stole. 7. She invades the apartment of her \"guardian\" and threatens his life in the middle of the night. 8. She endangers the lives of friends and innocents. 9. She very nearly burned her father to death when she was a teenager. 10. She pulls a gun on the owner of a car rental agency and shuts him in a broom closet to control him. 11. She commits multiple computer violations, including the hacking of government computers. 12. She carries and uses illegal weapons. 13. She is genuinely ultraviolent. 14. She shoots a man in the foot after macing his eyes, and she tasers another in the testicles. 15. She steals a motorcycle. 16. She chops her father's knee and skull with an axe. 17. She is vengeful in a way that makes Edmond Dant\u00e8s look like a sissy. Let's face it, Lisbeth is more than a little bit nasty. And taken a step further, it is safe to say that she is not particularly likable. She is cold, calculating, emotionally irrational, mean, detached, abrasive, unapproachable, unfriendly, selfish, mercenary, vengeful, and more than a few other things most of us would classify as unlikable. Out of context, Lisbeth Salander is the kind of person who most people would be more than happy to see locked up forever. And if all we had to go on were the reports of newspapers and descriptions of trials, we'd all see it as a failure of the \"justice system\" if she went free. Yet we cheer for her in the Millenium Trilogy ; we can't seem to help ourselves. And therein lies what Stieg Larsson is trying to tell us with his challenging protagonist -- context is everything. Larsson isn't simply writing a compelling series of thrillers (and I haven't been so locked into a book, as I was with GWPWF, for a very long time). He isn't simply fishing for a film deal. He isn't just sitting down to write a vapid bestseller. I'd even go so far as to say that Stieg Larsson is not a hack. Nowhere near. He is criticizing the very efficacy of what we so proudly call the \"rule of law.\" Larsson is suggesting that the \"rule of law\" fails because it has no room for context. It deals in absolutes (unless you're one of the super-rich or super-influential), and it doesn't give a damn whether you perceived a threat before you lit someone on fire; it doesn't care whether the sixteen year old you're having sex with is mature, in love with you and is totally willing; it doesn't care that you stole the car or killed someone to save a life; it doesn't care that you withheld evidence from the police to protect yourself or someone you love; it doesn't care that you hacked into computers for altruistic reasons; it doesn't care that you were bred to ultraviolence through nature and nurture; it doesn't care about you and it doesn't care about context. It just doesn't care, and because it doesn't care Larsson suggests that we should have a healthy disdain for the \"rule of law\" and recognize its terrible shortcomings because it is the structure we have to live with whether we like it or not. Yet with all this, The Girl Who Played With Fire is -- most importantly -- a cracking read. It is fast paced, cinematic in its noirishness, full of suspense, has a genuine twist or two (one of which actually took me by surprise), a cast of characters it is almost impossible not to love and hate (as the mood takes you) -- even thought they are all rather static -- and it ends with a cliff hanger of the first order (I am guessing this is a problem for some readers, but I am a fan of the cliff hanger). What a shame Stieg Larsson passed from us so soon. I could have read his books for the rest of my life. ...more He had come. He smelled of aftershave. She hated the smell of him. He...observed her for a long time. She hated his silence. Then he spoke to her. He had a dark, clear voice that stressed, pedantically, each word. She hated his voice. He laid the back of a moist hand on her forehead and ran his fingers along her hairline in a gesture that was probably intended to be friendly. She hated his touch. Lisbeth Salander is simply unforgettable. I read the first book in this trilogy the year it was published He had come. He smelled of aftershave. She hated the smell of him. He...observed her for a long time. She hated his silence. Then he spoke to her. He had a dark, clear voice that stressed, pedantically, each word. She hated his voice. He laid the back of a moist hand on her forehead and ran his fingers along her hairline in a gesture that was probably intended to be friendly. She hated his touch. Lisbeth Salander is simply unforgettable. I read the first book in this trilogy the year it was published in English and I remember the book so vividly that even five years later I transitioned into this book as if I\u2019d just finished reading Dragon last week. Salander is 4\u201911\u201d, but she walks across the literary landscape with such giant strides it is impossible to ignore her. People who have never read the books or seen the movies have a vague idea of who she is. People who have watched the movies or read the books may eventually forget her name decades from now, but they will not forget her persona; her verve; her courage. Now before we start feeling all warm and fuzzy about Salander there are few problems with knowing her. If you cross her she might throw a Molotov cocktail through your window. She is unreliable, unrelenting, and if you own a computer she will know everything about you. She is a hacker extraordinaire and even though she is extremely private, almost maniacal about her own personal information, she has no problem hacking into your personal affairs after all YOU should have been more careful with it. Despite her bristly exterior and her tendency to answer questions with a stare or a monosyllabic response you might find yourself attracted to her. She has a lesbian friend Mimmi who tries to explain Salander\u2019s relationship with sex. \u201dApart from the fact that you\u2019re not a dyke. You\u2019re probably bisexual. But most of all you\u2019re sexual--you like sex and you don\u2019t care about what gender, You\u2019re an entropic chaos factor.\u201d ENTROPIC CHAOS FACTOR, sounds mathematical and math does play a role in this novel, but my version of what Mimmi meant by that statement is that Salander is a person who will parachute in out of the blue, shag you until your nucleus becomes a comet, and then leave before you\u2019ve had time to light your first coitus joint. \u201dA root of an equation is a number which substituted into the equation instead of an unknown converts the equation into an identity. The root is said to satisfy the equation. Solving an equation implies finding all of its roots. An equation that is always satisfied, no matter the choice of values for its unknowns, is called an identity.\u201d Salander solves complex math equations for relaxation purposes. Throughout the novel she is pursuing the answer to Fermat\u2019s last theorem. Now in the 1990s Andrew Wiles solved the problem using the world\u2019s most advanced computer programme which sounds like cheating to me. When she does figure out Fermat\u2019s intention it is the only time I can remember Stieg Larsson recording his literary heroine...giggling. Stieg Larsson is an interesting story. He delivered three novels to his publisher and shortly thereafter died from a heart attack, attributed to walking up seven flights of stairs. This unexpected demise helped launch the books onto the bestseller lists. We are morbid aren\u2019t we. He was an investigative reporter by trade and there was an inquiry into whether foul play was involved. It seems he was just a 50 year old man that fate placed a situation in front of him, an out of service elevator, that provided the proper strain to his heart to kill him. What endears these novels to me, even more, is that he wrote them in the evenings as an escape from regular life. Now, there are issues with these books, the use of name brands over and over. You will tire of hearing Powerbook, IKEA and Billy\u2019s Pan Pizza. If Larsson ate as many Billy\u2019s Pan Pizza as Salander does in the book that might be the doughy rope that squeezed his heart. Billy's Pan Pizza is YUMMY!!! Click the link to check out the Billy's Pan Pizza television commercial. It is a hoot. http://youtu.be/LZ9nUvg5yhk Despite any issues I had with the writing, and sometimes it was clunky, the raw power of the writing and a compelling plot made those issues irrelevant. Salander gets along just fine with the majority of the population, but she hates men who hate women. She ran into several of those in the first book and one in particular is seared into my memory, Nils Bjurman. He is the lawyer that has been assigned to her competency case. She was declared incompetent by the courts and assigned Bjurman to take care of her affairs. Salander is a confident person sometimes too confident and in book one she underestimates her ability to control a situation with Bjurman. He turns the tables on her and brutally raped her. With a presence of mind that is beyond most of the rest of us she recorded the rape and even as he is doing the most sadistic things to her she is going over and over in her head where she made the mistake and what she was going to do to him if he allowed her to live. Interesting enough she lets him live, but holds the video over his head like the sword of Damocles. Besides the video she does administer her own form of brutal vengeance, but there is a practicality to her decision not to kill him. The courts would simply assign her another mentor that she doesn\u2019t have control of and of course she would have to weather an investigation into his murder. In this book she makes a similar mistake in her pursuit for the man responsible for inspiring the rage and the violence that swirls around her. Mikael Blomkvist is back and when his team of writers unearth a white slavery ring he finds himself battling a controversial issue that may impact the highest levels of society. Underage girls are being brought from Russia and forced into prostitution. It would be an easy assumption to make that every member of society would want to eliminate a situation that allows young girls to be exploited against their will. One of the problems is that men in government, in positions of power, enjoy the availability of such young, beautiful girls for their own sexual perversions. Despite the fact that Salander is not talking to Blomkvist, he is baffled as to why, she is drawn into the investigation because of the use of the name of one man... Zalachenko. As she becomes the main focus of the investigation she is forced to go underground, a skill she is particularly adept at, and as the rocket fueled plot comes to a conclusion this reader couldn\u2019t have put this book down even if the building was burning down around my ears because Salander... always... puts out a fire with gasoline. See these tears so blue An ageless heart that can never mend These tears can never dry A judgement made can never bend See these eyes so green I can stare for a thousand years Just be still with me You wouldn't believe what I've been thru You've been so long Well, it's been so long And I've been putting out fire with gasoline putting out fire with gasoline David Bowie ...more Okay I have to get this out my chest.

I read one reviewer described Larsson's writing as \"galloping prose.\" Galloping prose, huh? Here is a sample of Larsson's thrilling writing: \"When he got to the car there was no map in the glove compartment. He bought one in a petrol station, and a torch, and a bottle of mineral water, and a take-away coffee, and he put the paper cup in the holder on the dashboard.\" ARE YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT YET? The writing is filled with irrelevant detail with a weird fixation on coffee. The characters \"start coffee,\" \"pour coffee,\" are \"impressed\" with others' coffee-making skills. I swear F. Scott Fitzgerald did not mention booze as much in all his stories as Larsson mentions coffee in this one book. If Larsson had written \"Moby Dick,\" the opening line would be \"Call me Ishmael and join me for a coffee...\" At times, the book reads like an A-Z Street Guide to Sweden, giving endless, pointless directions. At other times we are given excruciating details of Lisbeth's shopping spree and how she furnished her new apartment with selections from her local IKEA. lemi give a sneak peek: She drove to IKEA at Kungens Kurva and spent three hours browsing through the merchandise, writing down the item numbers she needed. She bought two Karlanda sofas with sand-coloured upholstery, *ve Po\u00e4ng armchairs, two round side tables of clear-lacquered birch, a Svansbo co/ee table, and several Lack occasional tables. From the storage department she ordered two Ivar combination storage units and two Bonde bookshelves, a TV stand, and a Magiker unit with doors. She settled on a Pax Nexus three-door wardrobe and two small Malm bureaus. She spent a long time selecting a bed, and decided on a Hemnes bed frame with mattress and bedside tables. To be on the safe side, she also bought a Lillehammer bed to put in the spare room. The bathroom in her new apartment was already equipped with a medicine cabinet, towel storage, and a washing machine the previous owners had left behind. All she had to buy was a cheap laundry basket. Aren't your heart racing reading the enthralling details? SOMEONE PLEASE STOP THIS EXCITEMENT, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. Exhibit 2 : Hello, Can I get myself a storyline that isnt overwrought as fuck? So, There is a misogynist, bumbling police force; a sensationalist media on steroids; a group of BAAAD gangstas and a couple of good guys who still believe in Lisbeth when the rest of Sweden is after her blood. Not that this 4'11\" 90 lb superwoman needs their help, she can do BAAAD all by herself. Exhibit 3: Why do you have to butcher Lisbeth Salander's character? Okay, we GET it. Salander is brilliant. Really, REALLY brilliant. Like, so unbelievably brilliant you mere mortal readerss can't even, like, grasp how brilliant she is. Yeah, Stieg? I got it when you said she has a photographic memory; I got it when she single-handedly pulled off a multinational bank scam and stole millions of kroners; I got it when she invented the software necessary to hack into a major security firm AND police headquarters; why do I need to read endless pages of her effortlessly cracking complex theoretical math problems and THEN have to hear the history of Fermat's theorem, with the added bonus of learning that she solves it in the midst of also solving baffling crimes? Can't wait for the next exciting installment, in which Lisbeth Salander resolves the unified field theory while wiping out whole armies of cyborg ninja pedophiles. So in a nutshell Salander is now: 1) The. greatest. fighter. ever. 2) The. sexiest. woman. ever. 3) The. smartest. person. ever. 4) The. most. street. smart. ever. 5) Extremely rich. If Clint Eastwood, Albert Einstein, The Terminator, and Keyser S\u00f6ze had a baby it's name would be Salander. It is hard to believe that Stieg Larsson wrote both \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" and \"<+++>The Girl Who Played with Fire</+++>.\" I enjoyed \"Tattoo\" because Lisbeth Salander was a new, unusual but plausible protagonist and the plot (although it rambled at times) was fairly tight. With \"Fire,\" Larsson threw any pretense of reality or a cohesive plot out the window. What happened, Stieg? There is barely a connection between this book and the first. Instead of following the original, interesting and flawed characters that we cared about from the first book, we're instead given lengthy diatribes about shopping at Ikea, eating fast food and an irrational love for coffee. If those parts were edited out, the book would be probably 100 pages, not 400. Phew! After eveything done and said, it all comes down to one question: So do i recommend this book? If you like coffee, READ IMMEDIATELY!!!!! If you were disappointed with how very little coffee drinking there was in Dragon Tattoo, you will NOT be disappointed here!!!!!! This action-and-coffee-packed sequel to The Girl With THe Dragon Tattoo has 30% more coffee!!!!!! How does our protagonist, Mikael, manage to get through the day? Pour another cup of coffee!!!!! What does he do to come up with the best possible theory? Drink some coffee!!!!! Here's what some coffee companies/drinkers think of this book!!!! \"This book promotes our product very well\" -Swedish Coffee magazine \"Mikael's constant addiction to drinking coffee makes us happy\" -Starbucks \"I can totally relate to Mikael Blomqvist, I need coffee to get through the day as well\" -Coffee addict \"Going to Starbucks? Take this book with you!\" -Coffee addict \"I like this book, there's lots of cups of coffee\" -An underage coffee addict So overall, if you like mystery novels but prefer constant coffee drinking as opposed to actual character development, plot, or action, then read this book, you will NOT regret it! This book will bring out the coffee addict in you!

I was afraid The Girl Who Played With Fire would suffer from the sophomore jinx. I'm pleased to say it did not. Larsson must have figured out he had a good thing in Lisbeth Salander while working on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo because she's the primary focus of this, the sequel. Actually, it's not all that much like its predecessor. TGWTDT was a mystery and TGWPWF is a faster paced thriller. The structure of the two books is fairly similar: a slow build up to a lightning storm. Honestly, I can't figure out why these books work so well for me. They both begin slow and have a lot of extraneous details I think might have been pruned had Larsson been alive when they were accepted by a publisher, notably the oddly specific minutae of the characters' everyday life and the prominence of brand names. Still, once I started reading them, they kind of took over my life for a few days. The Girl Who Played With Fire is, in a way, an exploration of Lisbeth Salander's past. Where The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo barely scratched the surface, this book did some strip-mining. Since the villains were players in the sex trade, they were not sympathetic and quite vile. The action was even more brutal than in the previous book and there was a lot more of it. Without giving too much away, Lisbeth Salander is so tough there should be an internet meme dedicated to how much of a bad ass she is. \"If Chuck Norris had a sex change and gained 50% more damage-inflicting skills, he would be Lisbeth Salander\" or something to that effect. I felt that the parts of the story about Lisbeth eclipsed the other parts of the story by a wide margin, a good thing in my book. I wasn't that interested in the everyday business of running Millennium or who was falling for Mikael \"The Ladies Man\" Blomkvist anyway. I guess I should bring this review to a thrilling conclusion before I start giving away plot points. I enjoyed The Girl Who Played With Fire even more than I did the previous volume. Five easy stars. ...more A downright masterpiece. The action sequences, the constant tension continually building up to lead to a tremendous ending.

Introverted, extremely genial, and dangerous if need be, she's the epitome of the formula to the creation of a super-intriguing character. Like the first book, this was a complete investigation-kind-of-book. But unlike the first one, this has nothing to do with third parties, and everything to do with Lisbeth. It's a more personal book, and it cements the core of this series, which is Lisbeth. There are lots of new information about Lisbeth, and she becomes somewhat less enigmatic as we begin to get a glimpse at the troublesome, dark past. Sex trafficking, Russian hitman, murders. What else does a book need to be freaking thrilling? Salander in this book becomes obsessed with math, she takes it up as a hobby, and up until the last moments when her life is hanging by a thread, she finds the solution to a mathematical problem. Such a peculiar protagonist, I feel constantly intrigued by her and I always have to expect the unexpected from her. Up until half of the book, nothing extraordinary really happens, it's just plot building up but there's lots of Salander, so it's interesting and gripping to read. Then, at about halfway into the book everything changes. A police hunt begins. You'll have to guess who the hunted is. And how the hell they ended up into this mess. Surprisingly, there's less Blomkvist in this than the first book. Although, he's still a prime character to the story, he takes the role of the secondary character rather than the first one, as we saw him in the first book. In the entirety of the book, Blomkvist and Salander hardly ever meet. So, summing everything up, I'll admit that I liked this better than the first because of the more personal storyline the author followed. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!! ...more Much later.

After such insistence on preserving my idea of my father, my memory of our last meeting, this happened a couple of Fridays ago. I opened up some photos taken by my brother and there my father is, dead in his coffin. I must confess to being quite distressed. And I still don't understand why on earth is this something to preserve? I don't get it one little bit. ---------------- Hooked. Totally, completely, utterly hooked. I read this book yesterday during lunch even though I was with two perfectly nice interesting people. And then today. Today we cremated my father without any ceremony, but first there was what they call a \u2018viewing\u2019. I so didn\u2019t want to do that and still have absolutely no comprehension whatsoever as to why one would want to look at a dead body. So while the others did their dead body thing I sat in the lounge area with my nose buried in Stieg. And, although, it would not be true in the least to say I didn\u2019t go next door to look at my dead father because I couldn\u2019t put the book down, the fact is that people kept coming in to talk to me, like\u2026I don\u2019t know exactly\u2026.but maybe like they thought that this would create some link between me and whatever was happening next door, like maybe they were worried I\u2019d feel left out and what I wanted to say to them was \u2018Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m reading?\u2019 \u2018If I miss you all, honestly, I\u2019ll drop by next door, I will, really.\u2019 I didn\u2019t, doubtless you will be relieved to hear. Instead I chatted amiably to whoever wanted to interrupt me. But. I so wanted to say \u2018go away\u2019. And there I find myself having to put my book down for a bit to talk to my aunt, thinking why do I have to do this, my aunt probably doesn\u2019t even like me. My mother has two sisters, one\u2019s a nun, and hence she\u2019s an absolute trooper, but the other one seems a little fragile to me in some way that I can\u2019t connect to. And I know it is all my dead father\u2019s fault. I almost went next door to remind him of that. It was like this. We\u2019d been separated for many years from both sides of my family, but as a grownup I did start seeing just these two sisters again now and then. The first time my aunt Rosemary was with a bunch of nuns including my other aunt. Paul introduced me to them \u2018This is Cathy, my eldest, she is a divorcee who plays cards for her living.\u2019 All true, if you want to put it like that. My father said it with great relish and satisfaction, I might add. Not with a long mournful face, shaking his head. Not like, what am I doing to do with her? More like he\u2019d just bought a red car and didn\u2019t everybody know they go faster? He loved shocking people. But I do think the only person who might have been the least bit shocked is Rosemary. And ever since when I see her, I feel like she looks at me in some slightly dubious way. Like I\u2019m a riverboat gambler. Or a scarlet woman; that it follows in some way from being a divorcee who gambles that one is a certain colour as well. And the thing about scarlet is that it is one of those colours that is bigger than others. I was wearing a black party dress today with just the tiniest bit of scarlet on it, but it feels like more. It\u2019s a colour that stands out. In the literal definition of the word I\u2019ve never been a scarlet woman, but I have certainly done things for money in my life that don\u2019t feel much different. There too, it\u2019s a bit like the dress. A little bit of scarlet goes a long, long way. There is a most earnest statistical analysis of this book that will come later on the weekend when I\u2019ve finished. It\u2019s about breasts and punctuation and honestly, it will be a serious, weighty contribution to the understanding and critical analysis of this book. Update. To keep you interested while I'm still preparing my groundbreaking statistical analysis. Oh. Reading Paul\u2019s comment I\u2019m thinking okay, I need to put a bit more about this book here. So. I happened to recall, earlier today, a conversation I had twenty years ago when I was living in Sydney. The phone rang and it was an acquaintance, John. A bit of chitchat and he says \u2018Remember you said how much you were into mangoes.\u2019 Did I? I was slightly taken aback. \u2018Yeah, yeah. Last time I saw you, you were talking about them.\u2019 I cast my mind back. It was a Victory Dinner after a bridge tournament. We\u2019d snuck outside and shared a few joints between courses. But what on earth would have made me say that? Was I so wasted? \u2018Well, John, I\u2019ve never been averse to a nice mango\u2026\u2019. He was really being quite intense about the whole thing, \u2018I wondered if you wanted me to send you some. Send you some mangoes\u2019. This was really getting a bit silly. For heaven's sake, I lived in Sydney. I merely had to put my hand into the outside air and a mango might fall into it. And suddenly the penny dropped. He wasn\u2019t talking about mangoes. He was talking about Northern Territory\u2019s finest. He was asking me if I wanted him to send me some dope. Of course! He just didn\u2019t want to say, on the telephone. I was with it. \u2018Oh, Mangoes \u2026sorry John. You\u2019re right, I do still love mangoes. Great idea, please do send me some.\u2019 Later that night I told Michael about the whole exchange. He was in complete agreement, clearly John was sending us dope. We are expert bridge players, after all. Like we can\u2019t analyse a situation like this. Like it wouldn\u2019t be obvious in a Stieg Larsson book, what we were really talking about. A week later a box of mangoes turned up. Michael, with the desperate conviction of a drug addict, took the box apart and then each mango, still sure he was right. Me, I figured straight away, we weren\u2019t in a crime thriller after all. ------------------------------------------------------- The last word on this book. Okay. I\u2019ve, um, read the book now, so here goes. A book review. After a bit of an argument early on with somebody who had read this, I decided to keep some stats. But just as I figured this book was all about the new, busty Salander and the story line was going to be dominated by people sucking on silicon, (people, sic; dykes, yawn), she disappears from the story altogether! What a device. What a piece of creative trickery by the Stieg. What a way to skew my statistics. You will find her tits on pages: 15/16 27/8 75 85 92 103-4 106-8 and then \u2013 well, she\u2019s scarcely in the story for the next few hundred pages. So, although I began the story positively indignant that the superhero had a self-esteem problem that could be resolved by a bit of body mutilation, after a while the whole issue vanished along with the rest of her. I simply don\u2019t understand why Salander would behave in such a tediously average way. I was ready to be really disappointed with this direction (pp. 106-8 is when her friend Wu points out to her that she is hung up about, and obsessed by, her body) but I\u2019d forgotten it soon enough. In fact I wondered if the Stieg got rid of her just so as he didn\u2019t have to find anything more to do with these new possessions of hers. Setting aside the whole pretend breasts thing, do I have to say anything else about the book? It\u2019s fun, un-put-downable, just like the first one. A dissertation it does not require. I was disappointed with the chess, p. 143 which is badly done. Although this doesn\u2019t matter in a sense, because none of us know enough to care, if you extrapolate from that, you get to the book itself. If you happen to be in the general field of murder mystery conspiracy, journalistic exposes, police-procedurals etc and think this book is badly done, does that mean it\u2019s badly done? If we all don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care, then it isn\u2019t badly done, is that right? It\u2019s believable because it\u2019s believable. This is just a hypothetical, nothing in particular to do with the book itself. I hope somebody understands what I\u2019m saying here because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m with the plot\u2026even though it\u2019s mine. Maybe this is a better way of putting it. If somebody with a modicum of chess knowledge says the chess is badly done we don't care for obvious reasons. But if a crazed killer said to you 'Nup, sorry, that is just so unbelievable the way...This book is just so not like it is.', wouldn't we care then? Yes? No? On the usage of the comma in relationship to \u2018and\u2019, a source of some discussion recently as I'm confused by how often it is used and why. p.270 We have the sentence \u2018But we do have to stay on top of what the police uncover and worm out of them what they know.\u2019 I had to read that a couple of times before I understood it meant: \u2018But we do have to stay on top of what the police uncover, and worm out of them what they know.\u2019 I thought it meant that the police were uncovering and worming, though of course that sentence doesn\u2019t make sense. Then, what about these: p. 231 \u2018They had heard no sound from the apartment, and nobody had answered the bell. They returned to their car and parked where they could keep watch on the door.\u2019 Why? Why a comma before the \u2018and\u2019 in the first of these back-to-back sentences? And if so, then why not in the second? ------------------------------------------------------------------ ...more This is the sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and it was immediately as good as the first but this time I knew this from the very first page.

This one it starts off with a bang and you know immediately from the first page it is going to be just as good if not better. Blomkvist takes a back seat here and Salander takes the lead. She after all is really the most interesting character. It is slightly coincidental how Blomkvist is involved with the storyline but not so much it is a gaping hole in the plot at all. Once again the book is full of excitement and twists and turns. It has a steadily fast pace that never stops. One minute you're thinking it is going one way and then it just goes another. It never stop moving. I'd say it has a different tempo then the first one. It is much better paced I think from start to finish. The characters are already established for one thing. It is an entirely different story from the first one. However, Larsson still continues to highlight inadequacies in the government and system. So many characters are corrupt or just downright awful, people. Most of them are men. Larsson seems to have gone to war against the male race yet again. He still goes on his mini-rants but they're not quite so prominent as last time and fit much more into the story. I enjoy the straight forward style of writing - obviously this is through a translation of Swedish to English, but it feels different to other things I have read. Again, as with the first it feels very much as if Larsson has put his life and soul into writing these books and you can feel that emanating from the pages. I loved this just as much as the first - and he left it just at a point when you NEED to read more but it isn't a drastic cliff hanger but I am now eagerly and very impatiently waiting for the next book. ...more Unfortunately not as good as M\u00e4n som Hatar Kvinnor .

But, before I get too critical, I must admit that I couldn't put it down, and that the main characters, especially Lisbeth, are wonderful creations. I'm sure I'll read the third volume soon. ...more If loving the Millennium books is wrong, baby, I don't want to be right.

And you know what? Don't care. Don't give a shit. Because all I ask of genre literature is that it tell a helluva good story and Larsson, for all of his sins against the church of high literature, can tell a helluva story. Because a book like this relies so much on plot, here's the basic summary without any spoilers: Lisbeth Salander returns to Sweden after months of living abroad on the billions she stole from Wennerstrom; Mikael Blomkvist is now a media celebrity, though he continues to doggedly search for Salander; Millennium plans to publish a book on the Swedish sex trade (and they plan to name names of police officers and politicians who are involved, as well as bring charges against them upon the date of publication); both Salander and the author of the book become obsessed (for very different reasons) with finding a man named Zala; IKEA's 2010 spring catalog is described in detail; Salander is accused of a double murder and has to go into hiding; Blomkvist doggedly attempts to prove an uncooperative Salander innocent. Of course all of these plot threads, as well as many others, are brought together in the end. What makes this novel really work is the character of Lisbeth Salander. In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Salander is established as a bad ass you do not want to tangle with. In the movies, we have become accustomed to our female action characters as being towering Amazons with pouty lips, glamorous wardrobes, and double D's spilling out of Victoria's Secret push-up bras. The irony of strong women in film (and many books) is that they have to be model beautiful and highly sexualized femme fatales that are desired by fanboys everywhere. And in Lisbeth Salander, Larsson has created the antithesis to all of that hyper-feminine-but-I'll-kick-your-ass-and-look-good-doing-it bullshit. Salander is not tall, she is not glamorous, she is not beautiful. She's described by others as looking like a rag doll or a teenage boy. She's the last person you would expect to hand you your ass on a silver platter. But if you cross her, you can expect things in your life to go very wrong very quickly. The other genius thing Larsson has done with Salander in this novel is that she's beginning to evolve. Using her unexpected wealth, Salander has traveled the world and learned more about herself. She's begun to question her previous lifestyle and has realized that she has few true friends--and that it's her fault. Being anti-social and emotionally closed off has always been a defense mechanism for her, but it's beginning to dawn on her that the price she has paid for keeping her guard up may be too high. For the first time in her life, she has the opportunity to live a different life, but she's not quite sure how to go about it. There's an unexpectedly poignant scene in which Blomkvist looks around Salander's mansion-sized apartment and finds that she is only living out of 3 of the 21 rooms. He notes that, despite all of the new furniture, her home is soulless and completely devoid of mementos, photographs, or anything personal; it's as if she's uncertain how to make this a home and the loneliness of her life is evident. Despite this, she certainly hasn't lost her edge and she still lives a life of stringent moral standards, punishing her enemies without mercy and basically ignoring her friends. I also appreciate that Larsson does not set her up as someone who should be emulated (when Blomkvist blames Salander's mental state on her past, Holger Palmgren tells him, \"I hope you understand that there really is something wrong with Lisbeth . . . Her problems go way beyond problems she had at home\"). To me, Salander is a tragic figure. Sure she's MENSA-level intelligent, has a photographic memory, the ability to kick ass and take names, but who would want to be her? We also learn much more about her troubled background in this novel, which further explains some components of her behavior. As for the central mystery of the novel, I didn't find it as compelling as that of Tattoo and there's a twist at the ending worthy of a soap opera reveal, but I still enjoyed the ride enough that I've already ordered my copy of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

Plenty of men are short and women are tall. Plenty of women are athletic and men sedentary. Gender has very little to do with physical strength, abilities, or athleticism. And, of course, plenty of men experience indoctrination that they are weak or lazy, and plenty of women, thankfully, live in families that undermine these stereotypes, so I'm not talking in specifics here. What I'm talking about is media and culture and the gendered expectations they impose as a sort of zeitgeist based in gender. That spirit is still that femininity is weak and masculinity is strong, and even where we see it making no sense, it is easier said than done to untangle right from wrong. This second installment of the adventures of Lisbeth Salander looks very academically at appearances in basically the same manner as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo analyzed consent. It has Lisbeth with dark hair and light, tattoos and implants. It sizes her, the smallest of small girls, up against the most giant of giant men. It is also clever, in the same academic way that GWTDT was with consent, in easing the reader into comparisons and becoming more extreme, developing the idea to its furthest, as the book goes on. The boxer takes on the giant; Lisbeth takes on the douchey biker: Larssen eases us into the comparison of sizes and appearances. And the idea is this: appearance and size do not dictate our successes and failures; they should not dictate who we are. I think the idea of Lisbeth getting implants early on in the book is interesting. The feel of the way it plays out with her seems . . . off, but I still can appreciate a sort of contrast between my instinctive reaction to Lisbeth altering her body with tattoos to my reaction to her altering her body with implants. On the one hand, I do think my aversion to the idea of implants is valid because of all of the women I\u2019ve known whose implants have become infected or calcified. It\u2019s just a bad health decision in most cases, in my opinion, in a way that I don\u2019t think tattoos are unhealthy as a rule. On the other hand, I can see how altering your own body, in any way, can be experimental and interesting and give a sense of ownership. So, to the extent I start to judge the choice to get implants as succumbing to an oppressive social idea of women\u2019s bodies, and getting tattoos as valid and empowering, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being entirely fair. I am cool with a woman doing what she wants with her body, and judging a woman based on plastic surgery ultimately seems as dumb to me as judging her based on her tattoos. Still, it seems unlikely to me that a woman who had a bad day would run herself a Jacuzzi bath and sink to the bottom of it, pinching her nipples really hard, even if she had just gotten a boob job she was super excited about. That seemed weird. It also seemed weirdly simplistic to me to describe how pleased Lisbeth was with her implants and how they made her feel attractive. I don\u2019t dispute the idea that implants could make a woman feel attractive, but that seems like a shallow emotion to describe compared to other, underlying feelings that go along with it. Maybe it is not true for every woman, but when I drastically change my appearance to look more like a magazine and get a lot of positive feedback for it, there is always a feeling of betrayal I have that goes deeper than the flattery. I look more like a doll, and what people want from me is that I be a doll. But, I know that is not who I am or want to be. It also reminds me that people are suckers for media. So, while I don\u2019t think those are universal feelings, I do think that Lisbeth and I have similar enough outlooks that it throws me off that she would be so single-mindedly pleased with her boobs. Also, I will tell you right now that blond hair is not a good disguise. You go from dark hair to blond and you immediately get a lot more attention. Not that I think people would have identified Lisbeth, because I think they would have just been looking at her hair and boobs, but it is not a good disguise. So, I appreciate the academic comparisons of appearance, but I felt very disengaged with this story and these characters overall. Blomkvist is such a douche. Every time he said something, with his simpering patience, I wanted to punch him. The letter he wrote to Salander. Oh my god. I hate that guy. What a manipulative, selfish martyr. What was with Larsson being totally cool with Salander\u2019s statutory rape of the island kid? Oh wait, huh, did he say later in the book that the age for statutory rape in Sweden is super young? Nevertheless, why was Salander okay with that? Everything that happened at the beginning of this book was very disorienting. In GWTDT, you could have cut the first 100 pages, but in this, you could have cut the first 200. Not looking forward to the first 300 pages of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest . I don\u2019t hate Salander at all, but I do feel somewhat indifferent about her. At the end of this one, when (view spoiler) [she dies and gets buried, I was like, \u201cHuh, that is a bold move,\u201d but I felt no emotion about it. And then it is made less bold by her rising again, but whatever (hide spoiler) ] . Partly, regardless of what happens to her, I think Lisbeth\u2019s life is already forfeit to this war she is fighting, so it is difficult to have hopes for her. She isn\u2019t really a person, with her own dreams, because that isn\u2019t possible for her - she is a sort of slave to fighting hatred of women. That is important, and I love that about her character, but at the same time, it\u2019s not very human. It\u2019s not emotionally complex. Or, maybe it is ambivalence I feel about Lisbeth, not indifference, because in this one, like in GWTDT, there was a moment where she quoted something I recently said. It came about three-fourths of the way through the book, like it did in GWTDT, and it was sort of like a slap in the face. Like watching a robot take on my personality. Weird. I feel connected to Lisbeth through those things that she says, but it still always feels like Larsson was following me around, saw me say something, and wrote it down. And seeing me from the outside didn\u2019t really tell him what was behind the thing I said. That\u2019s how I feel about Salander \u2013 like Larsson couldn\u2019t crack through her character to tell me what was inside. Those are the things I want to know about a character: the guts and innards. I want an author to take them apart and show me the character\u2019s beating heart. That is not Larsson\u2019s skill, so I end up feeling disconnected. It is interesting that so much of this seems so purposeful, but an almost equal amount of it seems like a waste of space. After the first 200 pages, I was with the story, but until then I was doing some serious sighing and eye-rolling. I think it is a good policy to read these books in one sitting, and probably not while you\u2019re reading The Iliad , which is what I did. The Iliad is like a bowl of rich chocolate mousse, where you can take one bite and be satisfied for days. This book is like what I imagine a Billy\u2019s Pan Pizza to be: something sort of tasteless to rush through for the satisfaction of feeling full in the end. There is nothing to savor, but it has its place. ...more I struggled through this 514-page book. To begin with, all the homo, bi, double-partner, and heterosexual talk was a bit much.

He has a way of making you feel exactly as he does, it is brilliant. This book is more personal then the first, since it revolves around Lisbeth Salander. While the mystery of the Vangers in the first book was terribly engrossing and I couldn\u2019t wait to find out what happened\u2026this one is almost physically painful. I had to know what was happening, and I inhaled this book. His plot has so many twists and turns, every time you think you have enough information to form a theory he throws something else in the pot and your own mental calculations have to start over. He never lets you catch up to the story until the very end. Now that we\u2019ve cracked a chunk of the mystery behind Salander, I can\u2019t wait to pick up the next book. It is a horrible shame that we won\u2019t get the 10 books that Larsson intended. ...more OK I put this down minutes ago so this is going to be detailed and disorganized and inside baseball, okay?

This is a brick, first of all, my shoulder will thank me now that I no longer have to carry it around town. I was thrilled to be able to jump into it a day after finishing DRAGON TATTOO; basically when that one was over all I wanted to do was learn more and more and more about Lisbeth Salander. So it's good that I felt that way when I started because for about 75 pages this book is a lot of mysterious interludes broken up by accounts of Lisbeth's IKEA furniture. And yet, I cared. DRAGON TATTOO is complicated, I think we can all agree, and the writing is deliberate, methodical. It works out well because the hook is a cold case, and in order to turn up anything new it makes sense to take the details slowly. FIRE is driven by current events, but the same deliberateness is applied--more IKEA furniture, more Apple commercials, even several sections where scenes are repeated. You'll first read them from one character's POV, then 25 pages later you'll see them again from another character's POV. Every single time you start to think to yourself that maybe you'll just quit because there's no way you'll make sense of anything going on, Larsson revs up into some ridiculous action sequence. His action sequences incidentally are kind of great, and ridiculous, and completely insane. Halfway through the one with the celebrity boxer vs. the giant I was basically just laughing because why, how, what? Celebrity boxer? Come on. That's funny. I'm glad we're all having a good time here. The accounts of the violence are brutal, and if you had any trouble with the violence against women in the first book, this won't be any better for you. It's not exploitative or titillating, though--Larsson gives it the same treatment as anything else. It's journalistic if it's anything, it's the facts and he makes no bones about his own opinions of the creeps who commit those crimes. You can see his education and his years studying these crimes peering through every single sentence, and the accounts are sometimes so somber you just know they're not entirely fiction. I've spoken to some folks who couldn't get beyond the first chapter, and I really would urge everyone to continue--when you've completed the book, you'll find out that the first chapter isn't exactly what you think. Over and over again I was impressed with the victories Larsson gave Lisbeth, just because it feels so unusual to see a girl kick ass so so so so much. A girl who people constantly misjudge, you know, it's such a simple conceit but so powerful to me. However, if you really pile those victories up against each other, there are maybe too many. Possibly that's why the boxer gets in the act, otherwise it's just scenes of Lisbeth ruling everyone. I appreciated what he did with the ending--I appreciated the point he made, how much it really takes to incapacitate her. Maybe over the top but I kind of teared up anyway. If Lisbeth was Faith in the first book, she was latter-day Buffy in this one. Uhhhh what else. Oh: plot holes? The police work seemed unreasonably shoddy to me, particularly considering how far the circumstantial evidence is taken. Also why did it take anyone so goddamn long to go talk to Palmgren? Did the cops never even consider it? I did like the variety of police characters offered up, I also like that Armansky is given a little role of his own and it looks like he'll be back for the third round. Also hoping to learn more about Camille. Not entirely sure if I care about what's gone on with Berger; she got short shrift towards the end of this one. Also I realize I've gone this whole huge review without saying a word about Blomkivst. I'm with Lisbeth on this one, I think. Dude means well and I secretly love him, but also, I wouldn't necessarily answer his calls. ...more Larsson keeps up the terrific thriller and suspense work he started in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' even though that had to be one tough act to follow!

Mikael doesn't have it so good, either, but it's two of his colleagues who suffer the worst, most horrific fate. Actually, horror visits just about everybody in the book, but that's Larsson for you. Not only do we get a whole new plot, with intricacies galore in this second book, but we see our favorite characters evolve and deepen in complexity. We get new villains and we are revisited by some of the old ones. (Who knew Stockholm, city of majesty, light, and elegance, had such a nether side? Drugs, murder, political corruption, prostitution, rape--Stockholm's got it all.) Because I can't say much about the plot without giving it away, I'll just say that this is a fantastic read, maybe just one smidgeon less engrossing than 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ,\" but still guaranteed to make you stop everything else in life to finish it. ...more You do NOT want to get on Lisbeth Salander\u2019s bad side\u2026 The anti-social genius computer hacker is back in this terrific thriller that improves on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

Following the events of the first book, Lisbeth has left Sweden and been traveling abroad for over a year. She\u2019s angry with Mikeal Blomkvist and has broken off all contact with him, but he has no idea why since Salander is far too socially awkward to ever explain herself or try to mend a damaged relationship. Blomkvist is busy himself since recent events have made him an extremely famous journalist and the magazine he co-owns, Millennium, is still riding high based on his work. As Salander returns to Sweden, she\u2019s unaware that an old enemy is plotting against her. Meanwhile, Blomkvist and the Millennium staff are preparing to publish a special edition and book based on the work of a free-lance journalist who has collected a damning amount of material on the Swedish sex-slave trade and the government officials and customers who have allowed it to flourish. When Salander gets word of this, she takes a personal interest, but in typical Salander fashion, she does it on her own terms and still won\u2019t contact Blomkvist. This time, her independent ways backfire and she ends up framed for murder. Misperceptions of her background soon make her tabloid fodder as she\u2019s on the run and the most wanted person in Sweden. A handful of friends, including Blomkvist, are convinced she\u2019s innocent and try to help, but Salander is far more concerned with getting revenge than clearing her name. As with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, the main appeal of this book is Salander. Lisbeth would be a huge pain in the ass to know in real life, but she makes for fascinating reading. Her continued refusal to engage an authority figure for any reason, and her pursuit of complete revenge against those she perceives as enemies make Lisbeth a wildly original character. She only has three ways to deal with other people. Mild acceptance of those she tolerates, completely ignoring the vast majority, or the scorched earth policy she uses against her enemies. There\u2019s no compromise or quitting for Lisbeth, and with personal grudges to settle in this one, she\u2019s pulling out all the stops. Reading the first two books by Larsson is a kind of enjoyable torture since we know that he only wrote one more before his death in 2004. I sincerely wish he\u2019d have been able to write a dozen books with Salander and Blomkvist because I already know I\u2019m going to miss them after the third one is released here in the U.S. Like the first book, this one also has a strong theme of exploring the misogyny and exploitation of women in Swedish government and culture, and that leads to some frank, but not graphic, scenes of rape and abuse. And to anyone interested in these books, I\u2019d definitely recommend reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo first because reading this one completely reveals the entire plot of that one. ...more WHAT WAS THAT ENDING??? ugh. ...am I allowed to ship them yet?

If I didn't have two books waiting to be read/listened to, I would dive straight into Hornet's Nest in the morning. Ah well, the downtime gives me space to go watch Played With Fire on Netflix. Have I mentioned my love of Noomi Rapace yet? To be frank, Stieg Larsson was gone from this world too soon. I would have loved to see more of his characters, because everyone in these books (and it's a rather large cast by now) feels like a real person that you could meet in everyday life.

Yes, but oh so true to the story! On the surface, \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\" is about sex trafficking and prostitution in Sweden and high-ranking men who abuse underage girls. But, just like the first novel, it's not quite that simple - the story gradually morphs into a tale of sexual prejudice, abuse of power, and governmental conspiracy. And even more, this book is about Lisbeth Salander, her past, her roots and the events in her life that made her who she is - a violent vigilante who hates men who hate women. It is a great book, much more so in the second half than in the first. We get to know and understand Salander much better, her personal story is painful and at the same time inspiring, her violent crusade against abusers is compelling. However, as much as this book is a page-turner, the flaws can't be overlooked. The novel has a slow start - too many pages are dedicated to exploring everyone's sexual preferences/histories/partners/encounters, \"testing\" of Salander's newly acquired breast implants, etc. This part should have been trimmed down. Do I really need to know that Erika prefers doing IT with two men? Don't think so. The other thing that is even more apparent in this book is that Larsson has a habit of repeating himself, narrating the same events several times by multiple characters. Editing should have taken care of it. And my final qualm, this novel just seems a little incomplete, there are some loose ends left and it definitely lacks an epilogue that would tie the story together. Regardless of the flaws, \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\" is a worthy sequel and I think fans of the first book will enjoy the second just the same. I did and am now anxiously awaiting the release of \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.\" ...more The struggle with this book is finally over.

I needed one week to get through the first book of the series. And one entire month to get through the second. At first, here's what I liked about it (spoiler-free!): Lisbeth Salander is one of the most amazing characters I've ever met in literature. Scenes with her as a present force were the ones which kept me reading. The character development is brilliantly done, the exploration of her personal background comes very close to being shattering and fascinating at the same time. In addition, the villains are actually allowed to be called characters in their own right. They have motivations, they have fears, they have scruples, they have feelings, and yet they commit the deeds they are called villains for. Stieg Larsson cedes a lot of text to describe the characters' social backgrounds, their working environment and private relationships as well as the relations between each character. All of them are flawed, and - likeable or not - characters whose motivations you can at least retrace, even if not always understand or share. And last, but not least, Stieg Larsson knows how to write a thriller. During the last three chapters, this book was a real page-turner, gripping and compelling alike. But then, why didn't \"The Girl Who Played With Fire\" keep up with its predecessor's quality level? The aspects I liked about the novel are simultaneously exactly the aspects I disliked about it. Lisbeth is the most interesting character out of the entire novel, yet she doesn't even appear for more than 200 pages. The characters themselves are written in an interesting way with all their backgrounds, relationships etc. - yet there are so many, the reader would have needed a glossary to keep them apart from each other. How can I be supposed to distinguish two people called Sonny who both only appear twice or thrice throughout the entire novel? Maybe I do have no good long-term memory, but I just didn't mind twenty newly introduced characters, all working at the police force and investigating the crime case, contributing nothing to the plot and not being close to becoming interesting enough for me to keep up with their scenes. We still had a lot of Mikael and Lisbeth, but Stieg Larsson also included a lot of material surrounding minor characters, material which perhaps made the story feel more realistic, but which also made me feel bored throughout the course of very, very long-winded chapters. I am pleased with the thrilling climax and the cliffhanger, but if it takes 680 out of 760 pages to lead me into the story's core, I just don't care anymore. Two other major issues with this novel included the lack of realistic dialogues and the descriptive writing style which was already present in the first part of the series, but even more so in this one. Do we really have to spend six pages with Lisbeth buying furniture and thinking about how to arrange her new apartment? Apart from that, I had a lot of problems with trying to get into Mikael's head. In contrast to \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\", where Mikael was the uncontested protagonist, he appeared like a minor character in this one, and we did nothing but observe him while he was doing his work. Nothing really happened for a long time of the story. Ultimately, I was bored by it. The plot was indisputably well-developed, but the implementation into written words lacked exactly the author's affectionate devotion I monitored while reading the previous novel. For me, this was a huge disappointment, but I will definitely read the third book, \"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\", soon, and I can only hope it will be a dignified completion of the series. ...more I love this series so much!!!

So while I adored this book just as much as the first one, the first one has that first book in a world nostalgia that the rest just don't have (similar to the first Harry Potter book).

About to publish a book that reveals many dirty secrets concerning the international sex trade in Sweden, Blomkvist is caught up in a deadly race for the truth when his two authors are murdered and Salandar is accused of the crime. Larsson touches on corruption at all levels in this tale of women used and abused, treated like any other imported illegal product and powerless to protest. From low level johns to misogynist cops, from dark psychologists to supersecret intelligence agencies, many layers of Swedish society come under Larsson\u2019s microscope. It is not a pretty picture. Stieg Larsson - from famourauthors.org Salandar, back in Sweden after an extended sabbatical, has grown somewhat from the character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , but remains hard-core, justifiably paranoid, blessed with almost magical techie powers (maybe a bit too magical), and an impressive command of several forms of combat. She is, as usual, totally victimized and misportrayed by the powers that be, and needs all her savvy to try to right the latest wrongs. Blomkvist is perplexed by Salandar\u2019s unwillingness to communicate with him, but he has had girl-troubles before. He remains what he was in volume 1, a dedicated, moral actor trying to use his skills to make Sweden a better, or at least more honest, place. Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander - from wikimedia Blomkvist and Salandar are characters one can care about and the subject matter makes for pretty stark, sometimes cartoonish, delineations between good and evil. Maybe a bit more ambiguity would have worked too. But that is a quibble. This is a fun read, a book you will not want to put down, one that leaves you panting for volume 3. ...more Una excelente continuaci\u00f3n de saga. Me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s que el primero.

So the quote on the front cover says \"Even more gripping and astonishing than the first...This novel will leave readers on the edge of their seats\". If you replaced \"gripping\" with \"frustrating\" and \"astonishing\" with \"tedious\" and also \"on the edge of their seats\" with \"gnashing their teeth\" I would agree with that endorsement. I read the first in this trilogy during my holidays last year and quite enjoyed it. Perhaps I was under the influence of too many nutella crepes and those revolting throat soothers. I don't remember it being as long-winded as this though. I think its length could have been halved. The blurb on the back (and you may already know I'm suspicious of those who write back-cover blurbs and feel quite strongly there should be some kind of inquiry into their practices) states that our heroine is wanted for murder (!!). Yet the murders in question do not actually occur until about page 190. What were all the previous pages for? Amongst other things, we follow our heroine on her international holiday where she experiences a tropical hurricane and saves a woman from being murdered by her husband. All very nice, but not at all relevant to what then becomes the plot. Also, when the investigation gets going there are THREE (3) separate parties doing the investigations. So we have to put up with THREE (3) separate parties running up against dead ends and feeling as if some breakthrough was just there, out of reach, but they were too tired to see it. (Kill me now). Also also, the author spends a lot of extra words describing in detail how people get from A to B, or what model and colour of computer they use, and all sorts of other unnecessary details. (NB Is this a guy thing?). So you may be getting the impression I'm kind of cranky with this book, which is true. But I finished it because I wanted to find out what happened. Larsson is good at plots, even if slow to deliver. I don't know how people think of plots. A shame that his plots seem to revolve entirely around violent sex crimes though. I worry (yes I do) that the popularity of this series is because of some kind of morbid voyeurism on our part. I persisted with \"The Horse Whisperer\" (my least favourite book of all time) because of the terrible accident at the start. What a ghoul. Maybe that's why I like ye olde English detective fiction - the corpse is generally found in their chair at the club, or possibly in a bathtub. Usually there is no evidence of torture or gaping bloody wounds. Then the detective can say something like \"By Gad!\". ...more Over a year after reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo , Stieg Larsson has finally suckered me into continuing his series - or at least getting through the second book. This is mostly due to the fact that I recently saw the movie version of The Girl Who Played With Fire and got the sense that there was a lot that got cut out, but also everyone is starting to get excited about the American adaptation of these books, and I'd like to be fully informed before I start sneering at Rooney Mara's perf Over a year after reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo , Stieg Larsson has finally suckered me into continuing his series - or at least getting through the second book. This is mostly due to the fact that I recently saw the movie version of The Girl Who Played With Fire and got the sense that there was a lot that got cut out, but also everyone is starting to get excited about the American adaptation of these books, and I'd like to be fully informed before I start sneering at Rooney Mara's performance as Lisbeth Salander. First off, a quick note on the movie vs. the book: the book is structured differently from the movie, and goes into greater depth about nearly everything (this is sometimes a good thing, and sometimes a very, very bad thing). Entire characters and subplots are omitted, but the bare bones of the story is still intact. So I'd recommened the movie, but with the addition that you should read the book if you want to fully understand everything that goes on. Anyway, on to the book. It's been a while since I've done a review in my \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" style (PATENT PENDING), so here we go. The Good: Lisbeth Salander is still awesome, and always will be. Especially interesting is the transformation she goes through in this book, where she stops dressing like a teenager, removes one of her tattoos and most of her piercings, buys an apartment, shops for furniture, has a somewhat stable relationship...essentially, we get to see Lisbeth becoming a grownup. But rest assured - her awesome is in no way diminished by her newfound domesticity. She still fucks everyone's shit up on a daily basis, and a disinterested sneer is still her expression of choice. Additionally, the story itself is really interesting, not in the least because we get a detailed look at Lisbeth's background and how she became who she is. Blomkvist's detective work is still fascinating to watch, although I was less thrilled to learn the details of the continuing saga entitled Mikael Blomkvist Sleeps With Everyone And It's Totally Normal. (I mean, Jesus, Micke - Harriet Vanger? Dude. DUDE.) The Bad: I don't really know what went on in the editing process for this book, or if there was any. The only explanation I can come up with is that Stieg Larsson's editors, out of respect for the recently-deceased author, decided that it would be a fitting tribute to send his books out exactly as they were in the original drafts. That has to be it, because there's no other excuse for the staggering amount of pointless details we're subjected to in this book. I thought it was bad in the first book. I had no idea. Not only do we have to wade through pages and pages of the bullshit office drama plaguing the Stockholm police department and hear about every damn detail of Blomkvist's sexual exploits, but we also, in true Larsson form, hear about what every character wears every day, what kind of computer they use (always wanted to know how much RAM Lisbeth's computer has? You're in luck!), what brand of car they drive, and what they eat for every. goddamn. meal. When Lisbeth buys her apartment and has to furnish it, she naturally goes to IKEA (that's the only store they have in Sweden, right? Besides 7-Elevens, which are aparently everywhere and a great place for an affluent businessman to have lunch). The description of her shopping trip, where we are given an inventoried list of everything she buys , lasts TWO WHOLE PAGES. *facedesk* You're killing me, Larsson. The Ugly: Stieg Larsson, as far as I can tell, wrote these books mainly as a social statement about misogyny and sexism and how women are abused and mistreated by The System. He's not just aiming to write a series of exciting detective stories, he wants to open his readers' eyes to the very real problems of sexual abuse that women go through every day. For taking on this task, I applaud him. But he might be a total hypocrite. Stick with me, and I'll explain. Early in the book, we spend a (way too long and essentially pointless) few chapters learning about what Lisbeth is doing during her vacation in Grenanda. Basically she spends her time spying on a guy who's beating his wife, sleeping with a sixteen-year-old, and reading about math. ...hang on, what was that middle one? Ah yes. During her vacation, Lisbeth seduces and then starts a relationship with a sixteen-year-old boy. This is not as creepy as it could be (it's completely consensual, there's never any doubt about that), but it's still pretty icky. I don't care that Lisbeth looks like a teenager, she isn't. She's a twenty-four-year old woman having sex with an actual teenager. I don't know, maybe the laws are different is Sweden, but in the United States it doesn't matter how consensual the relationship is, it's still called statutory rape. I think I would have less of a problem with this if Larsson and his characters didn't spend every moment of his books shouting at us, \"Sexually abusing women is the worst crime a person can commit! If you rape someone, Lisbeth Salander will come after you and ruin your life because raping a woman is WRONG.\" I agree, but what Larsson is forgetting is that men can be sexually abused, too. What Lisbeth is doing is taking sexual advantage of a minor, and she never even takes a moment to wonder if maybe this is wrong. It simply does not cross her mind that, if she encountered an older man having a relationship with a sixteen-year-old girl, Lisbeth would make him suffer for it with no hesitation. Larsson got so caught up in making a statement about men who hate women that he completely forgot that his herione commits a similar crime. And that's not okay. Final thoughts: this was an interesting book, and I liked learning about Lisbeth's past, but I think I'm done. Thank you for your time, Miss Salander. It's been real. ...more", "Title": "The Girl Who Played with Fire"},
