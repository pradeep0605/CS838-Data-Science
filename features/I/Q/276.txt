This is an epic film on paper, gloomy and engaging, smokey, noir with crumbling ruins, young love, disfigurment, lust, torture...the stuff of Dumas, DuMauier and, as of late, The Historian. I woke up at five a.m. and had to sweet talk myself back to sleep: all I wanted to do was read. One Friday, after work, I took sanctuary in The Hotel Biron, those little tables in the dark, pages flickering with candles and drank a glass of wine in solitude, completely enthralled in the world of 1940's Barcelona. I walked home from the train at night and found myself saying the characters names beneath my umbrella, hoping no one would hear me talking to myself , but they were, quite simply, too beautiful to ignore: Julian Carax, Daniel Semepere, Beatriz...Tomas, Penelope Aldaya and Nuria Monfort. In a movie this would be too many people, but for this novel they were perfectly seamed, each point of view more entralling and taxing than the one before. Most refreshing, clearly the author wasn't poisoned with the desire to simply keep the reader in the dark: instead this story, with attention, was something you could figure out--because that's the way life is. The mystery itself isn't supposed to shock you intensely into thinking a book is good, that's a dirty trick. Instead, the STORY carried you. You cared about the story and it was a tragity and mystery all the same, simply because you were invested in these people and what became of them. To know them so intimately from childhood to adulthood and old age, to know them through various degrees of point of view seperation--to hear there is no Penelope, and then to know she is a sister, a love, but to some non-existant...well, it's gothic literature at it's very best. With a book like this I am almost, ALMOST tempted to give up my most pedantic and pretentious thoughts, paralells and character development--this story is a story and it's just that good. It is the Phantom of the Opera, those dark tunnels and pressure points, a lake with candles or drawing rooms with no fire in the grate and crazy wives being stored in attics over head. This is, quite literally a timeless tale, and yes, reading it will make you smarter, more interested, more cultured (the back of the book includes a walking tour of Barcelona. I missed Barcelona but I am quite determined to go now, with my copy of A Shadow of the Wind in hand, just like wanting desperately to visit Eastern Europe after I finished The Historian and see it all), but more importantly real life simply fades to black as you become completely, totally and fantastically helpless and wrapped up in the lives of others. While there are fun hybrids--Crash Topics in Calamity Physics, for one, which combine a courses, authors, quotes and plot lines from a thousand famous novels, this book really makes that unnecessary. This is a classic without any help, no cheat cheats necessary. Read it. Read it. Read it. **I write on books and other stuff at www.snapshotnarrative.tumblr.com ...more I read the opening few pages and instantly knew 3 things: 1. I was going to love this book. 2.

I was going to love this book. 2. I needed a whole pad of post-its to mark quotes. 3. I wanted to read this in Spanish for the rich poetry the language would add. A young boy Daniel is taken by his father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and told to salvage a book which he must take stewardship over. He choses a novel\u2014or maybe it chose him\u2014that touches him, stirs his desire for literature, and forever entangles him with the fate of the book and its author. The strange author died in poverty but now someone is seeking out all remaining copies of his unsuccessful novels to burn. Daniel embarks on a mission to solve the mystery of the author's story being watched by a revengeful cop and the book burner himself. As the story twists and slowly unravels he doesn't know whose account to trust or how it will affect his life. Wrapped up in the mystery is a message of death: do we live a full life or wander through it numb? <+++>The Shadow of the Wind</+++> is an allegory for death in a fictitious novel by the same title. Shadow is a perfect symbol for death evoking images of how death can be metaphorical instead of literal\u2014living shadows of lives, chasing shadows of dreams, being shadows of others, letting memories shadow life. Every character had shadows which could engulf them or they could overcome. In this sense death becomes a fate we chose ourselves. For death is not always the worst thing that can happen (\"words are not always the worst prison\"). Every time the word shadow was used I considered its illusion of death. It was with much thought that the word was scattered throughout the book. Spoilers Just as the fictitious novel was an echo of the book and Julian's life, I loved watching Daniel's life parallel Julian's. Both grew up poor without an ideal family life, fell in love with a rich girl who was the adoration of her father and whose brother was a best friend, evoked murderous anger from her father after impregnating her, and when they have a brush with death, extremes of hate and love anchored their fight to survive. As Julian's story unfolds, Daniel unwittingly finds himself in the exact same point of their duel destiny. Once Daniel is aware of the correlation, the comparison stops. Is it because Daniel consciously chooses to chance his path or has fate dealt him a better hand? Julian wrote \"There are no coincidences. We are the puppets of our subconscious desires.\" But while the message is clear that we chose our own fate, it seems there was no fate but failure for Julian. The sad thing is I believed Julian's love for Penelope as it grew in obsession more than Daniel's love for Beatriz which seemed a happy chance of lust. Themes of devils and angels are prevalent as characters save and ruin each others' lives. Clara is a physical angel who is blind while Fumero an emotional devil blinded by hate. While women tended to be described as angel and men devil, most characters held both in different shades. Take Julian the angel child bringing life (love, novels) who turned into the devil Lain Coubert bringing death (destruction, fear). But the characters pick whether to accept the destiny allotted them. Fermin was living death in the shadows of the street who had to get over his demons to find life worth living. The shadows for Nuria, Julian, Fortuny, even Fumero didn't have to give them a reason to quit living. They chose shadows. The book reminded me of The 13th Tale thematically, linguistically, and in delivery, although I loved this book so much more. The way the mystery unfolds finding tidbits from different perspectives enhanced the mystery and aided the depth of characterization. When I can see the vicious wife beater, deceived husband, and regretful father all in Antonio Fortuny I get a more well rounded sense of his motives. I enjoyed how the characters played different roles for each other. I love Barcelona as the setting. If you've been to the artistically enchanting city, you know it's the perfect backdrop to this eloquently enchanting tale with a gothic feel. The Spanish have a way of making all things metaphorically beautiful. The vivid romantic passages had me smiling and at times laughing out loud. I highly enjoyed the writing and it wasn't until two-thirds of the way into the book that the story finally stole my complete attention. Julian was my initial guess and while the story kept me questioning, it was the best solution and I was happy with the conclusion. But no novel is perfect; my issues are these: 1. The readymade quotes are extreme. Zafon salvages this by calling himself out on the commentary. He sets the comments up in dialogue and then uses another character to mock the snippets. 2. Perspective, particularly in Nuria's letter, is off. How could she know what Miquel looked at when dying? The chapters of her letters change from direct commentary to Daniel to third-party narrative. Elsewhere in the novel Daniel summarizes conversations in italics but I wondered from whence the interruption of her narrative with Fumero's story came. 3. I always hope historical fiction will showcase a more accurate moral setting, but it rarely happens. While I believed the sex about Zafon's characters, done in secret and with fathers chasing down the culprits, how could they find out they were pregnant the next day? I was also disappointed that all marriages were displayed as wrong and wives disregarded. Oh well. I guess it added to the Spanish flavor of the book. 4. American authors tend to impose unrealistic happy endings while Europeans favor poignant sad ones. At one point it seemed bad things happened to Julian for nothing else than this love of tragedies. It seemed Zafon was going to ruin the characters lives to make a point. But he makes his point with Julian and leaves Daniel to gives us a satisfied ending. A story about the living dead cannot be all bliss but we still find redemption as the characters step out of the shadows and live their lives. Quotes: Few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart. I believed, with the innocence of those who can still count their age on their fingers, that if I closed my eyes and spoke to her, she would be able to hear me wherever I was. A secret's worth depends on the people form whom it must be kept. Women have an infallible instinct for knowing when a man has fallen madly in love with them, especially when the male in question is both a complete dunce and a minor. Death was like a nameless and incomprehensible hand...like a hellish lottery ticket. But I couldn't absorb the idea that death could actually walk by my side, with a human face and a heart that was poisoned with hatred. The eternal stupidity of pursuing those who hurt us the most. Paris is the only city in the world where starving to death is still considered an art. Arrogant as only idiots can be. I felt myself surrounded by millions of abandoned pages, by worlds and souls without an owner sinking in an ocean of darkness, while the world that throbbed outside the library seemed to be losing its memory. Presents are made for the pleasure of who gives them, not for the merits of who receives them. Television...is the Antichrist...our world will not die as a result of the bomb...it will die of laughter, of banality, of making a joke of everything. I realized how easily you can lose all animosity toward someone you've deemed your enemy as soon as that person stops behaving as such. People talk too much. Humans aren't descended from monkeys. They come for parrots. God, in His infinite wisdom, and perhaps overwhelmed by the avalanche of requests from so many tormented souls, did not answer. Silencing their hearts and their souls to the point where...they forgot the words with which to express their real feelings. People are evil. Not evil, moronic, which isn't quite the same thing. Evil presupposes a moral decision. The words with which a child's heart is poisoned, through malice or through ignorance, remain branded in his memory, and sooner or later they burn his soul. Marriage and family are only what we make of them. Sometimes what matters isn't what one gives but what one gives up. Destiny is usually just around the corner. But what destiny does not do home visits. You have to go for it. Just an innocent boy who thought he had conquered the world in an hour but didn't yet realize that he could lose it again in an instant. Keep your dreams. You never know when you might need them. Fools talk, cowards are silent, wise men listen. Waiting is the rust of the soul. Sometimes we think people are like lottery tickets, that they're there to make our most absurd dreams come true. While you're working you don't have to look life in the eye. Most of us have the good or bad fortune of seeing our livs fall apart so slowly we barely notice. Time goes faster the more hollow it is. I learned to confuse routine with normality. The world war, which had polluted the entire globe with a stench of corpses that would never go away. The clear, unequivocal lucidity of madmen who have escaped the hypocrisy of having to abide by a reality that makes no sense. A story is a letter the author writes to himself to tell himself things he would be unable to discover otherwise. The art of reading is slowly dying, that it's an intimate ritual, that a book is a mirror that offers us only what we carry inside us, that when we read, we do it with all our heart and mind, and great readers are becoming more scarce by the day.

Please allow me to quote the author: \u201cOnce, in my father's bookshop, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.

On the one hand, this is such a beautifully written book, and is in essence an ode to literature. On the other hand, there are some serious flaws which distracts from the whole experience. The best thing about the book, in my opinion, is Zafon's skill in artistic writing. It reminds me of why I love to read in the first place, and makes me wish I could write as beautiful as this. The book contains lots of memorable quotes as well, definitely a good thing as far as I'm concerned. So after about 50 pages in, I was ready to love this book as I seldom loved another book before. But as the story progressed, that resolution started to diminish slowly but surely. Ironically, one the more obvious flaws is Zafon's overuse of stylistic writing. It seems like everyone acts or talks in a very elaborate manner, even in the simplest of situations, and this can really become tiresome after a while. The plot also isn't as ingenious as the hype would make you believe. Zafon does a good job creating a sense of mystery early on, and there are obvious parallels between the main character <---C>Daniel Sempere</---C>, and Julian Carax, the writer whose past he is trying to uncover. But ultimately, the stories of Daniel and Julian are seperate ones, and they just happen to interconnect with one another more by chance than by design. By far the most troublesome flaw is the way the mysteries are \"resolved\". All too often, answers are given by having some side character or another tell his or her story for pages. Nowhere is this more evident than at the end of the book, where literally every single detail is revealed in the form of a (very) long letter, even details which the writer of the letter never could have known, since she wasn't even involved in those events. It's as if Zafon did not have a clue or the motivation to write a logical conclusion, and decided to just dump all the information in one place. With a bit more attention to actual plot and character development, this could have been one of my favourite books. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed reading the Shadow of the Wind. It's just a shame that it falls some way short of its potential. ...more It's been a couple years since I read this book so I shouldn't and won't go into details, but the effect has lingered all this time.

I see how amazingly it is.. A Sad sad story of Coming of Age, Tangled Fates , Lost Old Friendships..Lost Lovers..but without losing Hope.. It may categorised as Magical Realism , but the hard sad Realism of Barcelona, Spain after the Civil War drowned the Magical aspect, but there's always that most real magic in it... Hope .. So yeah, I got teary sad eyes by the end and even nostalgic to the beginning of it...very excited and sad by the climax of the story, and just don't want it to end.. (view spoiler) [And so I got very teary with joy for the happy happy Ending for this Sad sad story... which make me rate it higher than I expected. (hide spoiler) ] And I have to admit that although I loved the first chapter so much, The one with The Creepy Cemetery of the Forgotten Books , but after that felt bored at many points, I even almost put it down for later.... Too much stories that split of the main plot just as the protagonist described The Shadow of the Wind he has read.. But the narrate came with too much descriptions and details that most of it have a minor relation to the main story.. also the very prolonged dialogues of a certain character -good for quoting though- made me fast read many parts of it. which was alright, fast reading some of this book didn't affect my overall Loving the story....

Juli\u00e1n Carax died mysteriously ,and every copy of all of his novels are burnt by a mysterious character sought to diminishing every memory of Carax...every shred of his soul.. It's a story about the Soul of Books... \u201cEvery book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.\u201d But our protagonist and narrator, Daniel, didn't know searching for the real life story of Carax and his mystery will lead him into very tangled stories that will also get tangled with his own story.....even his own fate... It's a story about Tangled Characters and Fates.. and while Daniel's searching the truth about Carax, he meet with different characters, and a new odd friend, Ferm\u00edn Romero de Torres who met accidentally with him as a beggar turned out to be fugitive of Inspector Javier Fumero a corrupt and fascist police inspector as many in these hard times and upheaval that was facing Barcelona. Ferm\u00edn became a good useful assistance for him and his father ,and who help Daniel searching for Carax story...but things isn't easy when Inspector Fumero is there ,and nit just for Ferm\u00edn, but for bigger secret from the past of Carax himself. And it's not only one with secrets...there's Nuria Monfort with her sad life in shadows.. who was an acquaintance to Carax, which may break your heart with her story.. there's tangled fates between so many characteres .. Pen\u00e9lope Aldaya the love of Carax and the sister of his best friend..and how their sad cursed love long ago tangled with the fate of Beatriz Aguilar who Daniel admires ,and the sister of his only friend.. (view spoiler) [I hated the very melodramatic step of the story when we find out that Carax and Pen\u00e9lope are brother and sister, that was too much sadness , yet it may explain why their love was cursed -as in One Hundred Years of Solitude- but was glad that Carax never find out this sad part till the end. (hide spoiler) ] There's Father Fernando Ramos and his sad nostalgia to the lost old friends... And above all, there is Sempere , Daniel's father who is one of the best fatherly characters I ever read...I loved so much his relation with his son and its development through the time....., \"I found my father asleep in his dining-room armchair, with a blanket over his legs and his favourite book open in his lap - a copy of Voltaire's Candide, which he reread a couple of times a year, the only times I heard him laugh heartily. I observed him: his hair was grey, thinning, and the skin on his face had begun to sag around his cheekbones. I looked at that man whom I had once imagined almost invincible; he now seemed fragile, defeated without knowing it. Perhaps we were both defeated. I leaned over to cover him with the blanket he had been promising to give away to charity for years, and I kissed his forehead, as if by doing so I could protect him from the invisible threads that kept him away from me, from that tiny apartment, and from my memories. As if I believed that with that kiss I could deceive time and convince it to pass us by, to return some other day, some other life. Time....... It's a story about Time... God, this part always touching me deeply and dreading me As well...but I love to read stories like this, specially when it's really perfectly written... There's more I wish I tell but that's already too much... finally It's a story about A City facing a hard phase... 'This city is a sorceress, you know, Daniel? It gets under your skin and steals your soul without you knowing it.' It may be just Barcelona in a hard time... City of Shadows, Days of Ashes those are chapter titles, and it fit the background story of the Spanish Civil War and these days after the fall of Barcelona. But the description and details of the city streets, the tram ,the gothic atmosphere , even the fictional Doors of the Cemetery of the Forgotten Books is very beautiful and unforgettable, The weather...sun rays ,even the hard snow storm by the climax is magically written making not only the city is a sorceress, but the novel itself...getting under my skin though all the boring bits..and stealing my soul into it by the end, making this Journey forever in my mind and imagination...

It must only mean that there are a lot of people out there that think very differently from me. Don't you be one of them. Seriously. Don't be fooled by this book. It is insipid, lame, and poorly written. First. The prose is so overblown that the author uses three adjectives for every single noun. Count them. He evidently was told that to be a writer you have to make everything as descriptive as possible, and then he decided that meant that each noun had to be modified three, always three, and only three times. Argh. Second. The author must have looked up every word he could in a thesaurus and chosen the one that was most obscure or had the most syllables. Who is he trying to impress? Maybe it was the translator's fault? Maybe not. Either way, this style is used even when describing what the ten year old character sees and says. Which brings me to my next point. Third. Every character in this book speaks with exactly the same voice. All you hear is the authors voice, not any different characterizations. And that voice demonstrates the problems I described in my first and second points. But that's not all. There is an even worse, and definitely fatal, problem with this book. Fourth. This story was written as a mystery. Nine years lurch by as the character slowly tries to unravel the details of the main conflict. I actually don't have a problem with this in theory. Unfortunately, after three quarters of the book, and numerous new characters, the mystery is no clearer. So what does the author do about it? He has one of the characters write a 30 page (or so) letter to the main character telling him what really happened. Ta-da. The mystery is solved. The author is such a terrible writer that he can't even solve his own mystery. He has to use a cheap cop-out to clear everything up. I can't respect that. Sorry. I can't believe so many other people have. Boycott the book. Really. ...more I found this novel by accident, while quickly browsing shelves at the local library, and let me just say it was the best accidental find i've had in years. From the very first line to the end i loved it, and as a reader i am not easily pleased by anything. I love stories out of the ordinary that captivate my imagination and run away with it. That is exactly what The Shadow of The Wind did. Right off the bat the plot intrigued me, Daniel Sempere is taken to the a secret labyrinth of forgotten book I found this novel by accident, while quickly browsing shelves at the local library, and let me just say it was the best accidental find i've had in years. From the very first line to the end i loved it, and as a reader i am not easily pleased by anything. I love stories out of the ordinary that captivate my imagination and run away with it. That is exactly what The Shadow of The Wind did. Right off the bat the plot intrigued me, Daniel Sempere is taken to the a secret labyrinth of forgotten books - the place where books are brought for their final rest after the world has forgotten their existence - and told by his father to pick one to always care for and protect. He chooses The Shadow of The Wind and his life is forever changed by his fascination with the book, its author and his determination to uncover the mystery surrounding the doomed fate of all other works by the author. What fascinated me most as Daniel started to get entangled in the mysterious web of the book and its author's history, was how Daniels life began to mirror Carax (the author of the book). The writing is almost poetic yet simple to follow and enjoy, their are subplots that run alongside the major plot so the book isn't one dimensional and boring. Overall this is a fascinating read that is sure to take you on an adventure that will make you wish there were more pages to read after you turn the last page. Highly recommended for those who are not afraid to explore other worlds or allow a book to engulf their senses completely. ...more \u0646\u0639\u0645 ..\u062b\u0645\u0629 \u0633\u062c\u0648\u0646

Todav\u00eda recuerdo aquel amanecer en que mi padre me llev\u00f3 por primera vez a visitar el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados. Porque cinco estrellas no me alcanzan para la constelaci\u00f3n mayor que quiero armar en este firmamento digital, porque pase las cuatro de la ma\u00f1ana devorando frases, p\u00e1rrafos, paginas, hojas y cap\u00edtulos como un hombre que ha estado hambriento de arte por bastante Hoy se celebra el 15 aniversario de la publicaci\u00f3n de esta maravillosa obra de arte, que no me canso de recomendar. Todav\u00eda recuerdo aquel amanecer en que mi padre me llev\u00f3 por primera vez a visitar el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados.

No pod\u00eda evitar pensar que si yo, por pura casualidad, hab\u00eda descubierto todo un universo en un solo libro desconocido entre la infinidad de aquella necr\u00f3polis, decenas de miles m\u00e1s quedar\u00edan inexplorados, olvidados para siempre.

I appreciated what the author was trying to do, but he didn't do it well enough to keep me reading. Yes, Romantic lit is full of cliche, but the thing is to do it in an intriguing way and with enough wit to keep your audience interested. This book did not have that balance.

I know it lost something, actually, because some of the sentences are rather awkwardly phrased. But Arturo Perez-Reverte's gothic-esque novels were also in Spanish, and they still had their magic in translation. So, I don't forgive this guy enough to finish the book. Which I didn't, by the way. Got about halfway through because I was hoping it would get better, but it was still not grabbing me, so. Onto the next! ...more 2/2.5 stars .

Despite its obvious qualities, I have to admit that I'm a little baffled of its status given that all the flaws, if found in some random YA book, would be called out without any doubt. \u2718 Caricatures as characters , from Daniel the Romantic whose constant whining reminded me of some 18th Century hero (someone saves me from Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand , please), to the twisting-moustache villain whose mother, you guessed right, was a crazy bitch (mwahahahaha). As for the women (OMG, the WOMEN), they're either sexual creatures (often vile and manipulative, because of course *roll eyes*) or solely conceived for the Great Goal of Bearing children (or assuming their care). It's pretty simple, actually : the good girls are those who get pregnant or are desperate for it, and all women are portrayed through their looks. All of these characters were flat and forgettable in my book. \u2718 Blatant sexism pouring through every page , and before you mention it, I KNOW, the society in 1945/1950 wasn't kind on women. I do know that, yet I don't believe that the portrayal of sexist behavior had to be so IN YOUR FACE. In the past I've read historical novels that let me furious about the way women were treated and categorized into little boxes (mother, virgin, whore, if you're asking) but in The Shadow of the Wind I never felt that the issue was handled or acknowledged, or barely (they do mention it in other men, but for me they were no better) . It was just THERE. All the time, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to care about characters - Fermin and Daniel, for example - who constantly objectify women, when they're not busy expressing stereotypes like, \"women can't do Maths\", or, \"women who let you touch them the first time are whores\", etc, etc. I read the French translation, so I'm not going to write down the quotes, but they are EVERYWHERE. I felt like drowning. \u2718 The instalove, anyone? Far from me the intent of spoiling the story to you, so I'll just say this : there are three couples in this story, and the THREE OF THEM suffer from major instalove (the kind where people see each other once, talk twice, and share iloveyous). What the hell?! Again, if this book was called The Storm and The Thorns , and some generic YA bullshit, it would have annoyed me, because I cannot feel invested in a romance if there's neither growth nor depth . Why in the world should I feel differently this time? I do not. Honestly? I couldn't care less. \u2718 The resolution of the intrigue did not satisfy me, because I found the way it was revealed rather lazy . Sure, I did not expect it, but after having remained in the dark during 80% of the book, I was a little disappointed by the avalanche of information that was thrown in my face, in a info-dumping fashion. Even with the interesting (view spoiler) [meta narration (hide spoiler) ] , it felt like such a cop-out. \u2714 The atmosphere is darkly enticing, captivating, even, and for me the real MC is Barcelona . Indeed I couldn't look away from the fascinating picture Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n created, from the vivid slices of life put into black and white letters. I wish the descriptions of Paris would have reached this level of brilliance, but I didn't really mind. Albeit the difficult times described, reading The Shadow of the Wind made me want to come back there, and I probably will very soon. \u2714 The writing, if not free of some cheesy figures of speech - but it could be the translation - is addictive and compelling . From the first page I was hooked, and my interest didn't falter before reaching the second half (but I already explained why). \u25ba All in all, The Shadow of the Wind was a disappointment for me. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but in the end, the story didn't convince me, and even the message - no matter how great it was, or wanted to be - felt a bit superficial because spoiled by the lack of depth of the characters. *Shrugs* For more of my reviews, please visit: [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more \"Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you.\" Well, I wonder then what part of me I saw inside this book - a book I adored despite its imperfections, despite its frequent veering into melodrama, despite (or maybe because of?) its densely Gothic atmosphere. Whatever it was, it was enough to make me lose myself completely in the rich setting of mid-20th century Barcelona, in the world of seductive dangerous power of literature and perils and passions of young love, a \"Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you.\" Well, I wonder then what part of me I saw inside this book - a book I adored despite its imperfections, despite its frequent veering into melodrama, despite (or maybe because of?) its densely Gothic atmosphere. Whatever it was, it was enough to make me lose myself completely in the rich setting of mid-20th century Barcelona, in the world of seductive dangerous power of literature and perils and passions of young love, and the contrasts of idealistic innocence with the weariness of experience, all against the rich tapestry of the city full of beauty and secrets and vividness, all told in a lavish idiomatic language that makes you forget you're reading a translation. And over all of this gothic surreal passion turned into words hangs a real grim presence of those in power who can come after you whenever they please, and who will try to silence you whenever they feel like it. \"I told her how until that moment I had not understood that this was a story about lonely people, about absence and loss, and that that was why I had taken refuge in it until it became confused with my own life, like someone who has escaped into the pages of a novel because those whom he needs to love seem nothing more than ghosts inhabiting the mind of a stranger.\" This is really a story within a story. Narrated by a young Daniel Sempere, it chronicles his transformation from a child to a young man in a Francoist post-war Spain, his loves and obsessions, his brushes with the world of mysteries and reality - both of these worlds equally dangerous and fascinating. But Daniel is really a medium through which we learn the heart and soul of this book - the story of Juli\u00e1n Carax, a man who wrote a book that finds its way into Daniel's life, a man whose past and present shape the course of all the events in this narrative, Juli\u00e1n Carax who seems to be the embodiment of both driving force and destructive force in the pages of this novel. \u201cThere are few reasons for telling the truth, but for lying the number is infinite.\u201d This book left me in an enchanted daze, and I'm still struggling to figure out why or how. What was it exactly that made it so easy for me to overlook the imperfections and blemishes of this story - the not-uncommon sexist male gaze, the telenovela-like melodramatic developments, the sometimes strange choices of inserting exposition into the narrative flow. \"A story is a letter that the author writes to himself, to tell himself things that he would be unable to discover otherwise.\" And the only answers I can find are these - it was the fantastic engrossing atmosphere and the sincere unabashed love of literature, combined with the language that sings to you in all its exuberant beauty. The atmosphere is built on a classic Gothic setting. The foreboding darkness haunts the story, complete with foreshadowings, strange haunted old mansions, dark secrets waiting to be unearthed, feverish passions and dark past tormenting the characters, emotional epistolary confessions, menacing villains, and dark stormy nights in abundance. Shadows are everywhere, and things lurk in them, be sure of that. And destiny seems to reach in with its meddling hand and place things in necessary to it order. And the tortured, passionate love stories - oh yes, they are here, too. \"Memories are worse than bullets.\u201d And yet the framing setting of 1950s grounds the Gothic atmosphere, forces it into reality. And the pervasive sharp humor makes the story quite self-aware of its own stylized nature, making the elements that can easily turn annoying into fascinating bits instead. \"Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.\" Daniel, a son of a bookshop owner, has a special connection with books - after all, he was introduced by his father to the mysterious place known as Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a place in the heart of Barcelona where abandoned books are stored, a place from where he is allowed to 'adopt' a book - and what calls to him is the book by an obscure writer Juli\u00e1n Carax, a Barcelonian himself, a man long-dead, a man whose remaining books are hunted and burned by a mysterious stranger. \"I began to believe that Juli\u00e1n was not a man, he was an illness.\" It's Juli\u00e1n Carax, his elusive past and present, the enigma that surrounds the man and is impossible for Daniel to resist that form the cornerstone, the centerpiece of this novel. Juli\u00e1n, a tragic hero of the Gothic novel, whose life and character are slowly revealed bit by bit, until you realize you are just as enchanted with him as the people who have met him seem to be - and all that without Juli\u00e1n ever making an appearance himself. And by the time we see the warning signs of Juli\u00e1n's single-minded destructive obsession, it is too late to turn back, and we begin to understand the strange obsession with him that more than one character carries. \"There are worse prisons than words.\" This book is an example of the journey, not the destination. The plot twists are not pivotal. The reveals that come are not that important, and there are plenty of clues for the reader to come to the conclusions well before they are revealed. What is important, however, is allowing yourself to step into the world Zaf\u00f3n creates, into the early- and mid-century Barcelona, under the shadow of gothic buildings, into the world that no longer exists. Lovely, lovely book; not perfect but engrossing and beautiful, and well-deserving of the attention it has received. Reading it is a quite an experience. 4 stars. \"Once, in my father's bookshop, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart. Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a palace in our memory to which, sooner or later\u2014no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn or forget \u2014 we will return.\" ...more Second reading: May 23-25, 2015- Okay, I can confidently say, upon re-reading this, that it is one of my all-time favorite books.

The weaving together of so many storylines and characters is remarkable. I can't gush enough about this book, so I will just say EVERYONE GO READ THIS NOW PLEASE. You won't regret it. First read: May 12-17, 2014- Everything about this novel was captivating. The story follows Daniel, a young boy, whose father is a bookseller. He is taken to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and allowed to pick out one book that he is expected to 'save' or, in a sense, remember throughout his life. He picks a novel by Julian Carax titled \"The Shadow of the Wind,\" and is immediately sucked into the story. From there, the novel follows Daniel as he begins to learn more about the illusive author, Julian Carax, and about the web of lies and intrigue that he gets trapped in. The writing is absolutely gorgeous. The book is full of incredible quotes, wonderful, beautifully strung out sentences. I never underline in books. This book, however, required a pencil at the ready at all times, because I couldn't pass up underlining some amazing parts. Though the plot isn't super strong, there is a mysterious and magical quality to the book that propels you through it, page after page. The characters feel so real, and thus their lives seem to be playing out for you in such a real way that you are concerned and invested, wanting to know what happens next. I loved the setting of Barcelona. This is also a book translated from Spanish, which is even more impressive on the part of the translator. I think the translation was incredible. Overall, this is a book that I will return to again in my life, I am sure. It is captivating and a new favorite. 5/5. ...more Dire.

He chooses an obscure novel, The Shadow of the Wind by the enigmatic Juli\u00e1n Carax, an author whose life and work is shrouded in dark mystery. Over time, the book awakens this socially awkward boy to fresh possibilities and new friendships in a city that is still shackled by its recent history. Daniel himself describes the novel thus: \"It is a story of love, of hatred and of the dreams that live in the shadow of the wind.\" In the honeymoon period of my read I was already thinking it to be one of the best books that I've read in a very long time. After a handful of chapters, I was wishing that Goodreads would allow 5-star-plus ratings for special books such as this. The author's character imagery is up there with M\u00e1rquez and Rushdie. The story has heart and soul and it nobly champions the underdog in an unjust world. Look out for nasty piece of work, Chief Inspector Francisco Javier Fumero, he of the pencil moustache and greasy grin, who is very much the b\u00eate noire of the piece. Z\u00e1fon's expressive prose held me in a dizzy state of veneration and had me purring in my armchair like a pampered pussycat. But, oh! Alas, damnation and gadzooks! Did you hear me? Gadzooks, I said!! The author somehow almost snatches defeat from the jaws of victory by allowing his dazzling story to become bogged down by a warehouse load of wearisome narrative in the middle orders of the piece. \"Get on with it, Z\u00e1fon!\" I shouted. (He didn't hear me). And where's a book defibrillator when you need one? It's a real shame, because this book is infused with brilliance; Carlos Ruiz Z\u00e1fon is incontestably touched by greatness. In my humble opinion, this magical rites of passage, good-versus-evil sprawl of a novel would have easily merited that unattainable 5-star-plus rating, were it not for the drawn out tedium of its meandering epicentre. Editing out a hundred or more pages would've done it a power of good. I'm still awarding it 4.5, rounded up to 5. Its sublimity outweighs its imperfections. And listen up, my Goodreads' brothers, sisters, funsters, pseuds, bibliophiles and savants. Daniel Sempere's book epiphany is one which will resonate with each and every one of you. For each of us there is one book that has been waiting for us from before we were born.

Posted to The Literary Lawyer.ca A Magical Journey - 5 Stars I has been a few years since a story has captivated me so completely. Several days after finishing this novel, I struggle to find to words to express my feelings. For me, The Shadow of the Wind is a novel that has a mind, emotions and a soul. It was a story within a story in which the reader becomes a participant. Through the eyes of Julian we death and resurrection. Through Daniel we see a parallel with the benefit of foresight. Through the eyes of each reader, we connect the enduring themes to the parallels in our own lives. A truly remarkable experience. Plot The story unfolds in several layers. At its base, it is a story of young Daniel Sempere and his coming of age. The son of a single father and bookstore owner, Daniel is taught early of a love for the written word. Daniel's world is changed on the day his father brings him the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. As a repository of rare and books in danger of disappearing forever, Daniel is told to choose a book for which he is to become guardian. Daniel chooses a sparsely published book by the obscure author, Julian Carax. Daniel begins a journey to learn of the book's origins, the reasons for its rarity and the story behind the enigma that is Julian Carax. Daniel soon finds himself tangled in a web of shared history, revenge, lost love and the pursuit of purpose through art. My Take This novel was engaging in most every aspect. The plot was gracefully constructed. The reader was taken on a personal journey in which the protagonist learned about himself through the history of an underappreciated, little know author. The plot was deeply layered and expertly drew parallels in the life of protagonist and life and trials of the mysterious author. On its surface, the mission undertaken by Daniel appears unimportant and unduly dangerous, yet both Daniel and the reader become desperate to understand the mystery and the humanity of Julian. Despite the attention to plot, the characters do not suffer neglect. Daniel is young, innocent and na\u00efve but he is able to understand the complexities he discovers though the mentorship of his older, streetwise friend, Fermin. Although Fermin occasionally teeters on the edge of stereotype, his carefree and careless shamelessness is a striking contrast to the brooding intensity and youth of Daniel. Daniel and Julian are crafted with such care that a fan of the character novel, will find much to appreciate. Much of what I enjoyed in this novel is intangible and distinctly emotional. The story was able to elicit the feelings of the awe of youth, the kinetic excitement of young love and the blind intensity of youth. The reader experiences this, not through the manipulation of the their emotions but with an empathy of shared experience. Final Thoughts At some time in the future, I will come back to this story and reflect on the novel's allure. Maybe at that time, I will better be able to explain my thoughts and reactions. Until that time, contemplate the emotions emanating from your own experience and imagine a story that shares those dreams, fear and desires. An amazing novel and the newest addition to my all time Top 10 list. It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex - 2.5 There are several instance of sexual encounters. The instances are mild and are not descriptive. The content is not graphic. Language F-Word - 9 instances Mild Profanity - Approx. 30 Religious Exclamations - 5 Violence - 3 One of the characters has suffered a lifetime of violence. While the descriptions are not graphic, he suffered abuse and other violence through his life. A character is found badly beaten as a result of his sexual orientation. There are several murders discussed in the book as well as knife/gun fight. Violence plays a role in the background but is rarely graphic in nature. ...more I went for a re-reading of this book as a prelude to my going to Barcelona last week.

I first read it ten years ago and was utterly enthralled by it. Books change \u2013 though of course it\u2019s we who change \u2013 as time passes, and this was in several ways a different reading experience. I may not regard it as quite the masterpiece I did back then, but it is still a bloody good yarn. To quote the Scotsman : Good old-fashioned narrative is back in fashion\u2026 his (Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s) tale has a dramatic tension that so many contemporary novels today seem to lack. The most significant way this was a different reading experience was that this time I no longer only imagined the narrow streets of Barcelona. I walked them, sucked in the atmosphere and basked in the Gothic setting, which is so rich and all-empowering in the city \u2013 and such an important backdrop for Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s story. This is the street in which Daniel and his father live and have their bookshop: Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s plotting is intricate and labyrinthine (and made me think of Zadie Smith\u2019s advice to writers: Watch \u2018The Game of Thrones\u2019 series to learn about plot in stead of just experimenting and going inward, apropos of the Scotman\u2019s comment), and I marvelled at how Zaf\u00f3n managed to control all these different, quirky characters and their separate, yet connected, storylines. A beautiful lamppost on La Rambla which Daniel and his Fermin (by far the novel\u2019s most interesting character) notice and comment on: The novel encompasses a literary mystery \u2013 a search for a mysterious, possibly murdered author \u2013 as well as several intertwined love stories, Gothic melodrama, an evocation of post-Civil War Spain (or Catalonia), a coming-of-age story and a historical thriller \u2013 all in a tone that manages to be alternately beautiful, humorous and entertaining. Some of the quotes I recognized as being perhaps a wee bit popular, but Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s tongue-in-cheek mastery of them hardly ever made them appear too clich\u00e9d or banal. There was just too much exuberance for me to stop and wrinkle my brow at them. A few examples: There\u2019s no such thing as a dead language, only dormant minds. The man\u2019s oratory could kill flies in midair. One of the pitfalls of childhood is that one doesn\u2019t have to understand something to feel it. By the time the mind is able to comprehend what has happened, the wounds of the heart are already too deep. These people who see sin everywhere are sick in their souls and, if you really press me, in the bowels, too. The endemic condition of the Iberian saint is chronic constipation. Prior to re-reading it, I had read a review in which the reviewer was disappointed (though most of my GR friends love it), so I went in with somewhat tempered expectations, anticipating a tut-tutting disdain for more genre-oriented literature. Alas, in that I was disappointed \u2013 happily so. Because Zaf\u00f3n is too intelligent and too witty for the entertainment of the novel to feel flippant or overly young adult. As I sped towards the end of the novel, I felt excited, then moved, then \u2026 well, I won\u2019t say how I felt about it at the end because that would rather spoil it for anyone who belongs to that minority of people who still haven\u2019t read this book.

You have to go for it yourself. ...more \u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd

An innocent boy tries to find his favorite author\u2019s story without realizing that the danger will come to his life.. You guys should know how much I love Gothic romance, but it\u2019s not that every gothic fiction will be incredibly fantastic like this. It\u2019s not just an intense gothic mystery. It\u2019s also suspenseful, beautiful , and gut-wrenching. Gosh.. when all the mystery begins to unfold, it\u2019s crazily unputdownable that I don\u2019t even want to work, do the job or anything. Shock. Terrify. Smile. Surprise. Oh.. All the freakin' feels! Daniel Sempere in his 10 year-old is taken to visit The Cemetery of Forgotten Book by his father.

Daniel finds an interesting book by Juli\u00e1n Carax.. \u2018The Shadow of the Wind\u2019.

The secret about hatred, scandal, and doomed love.. I want everyone to know this book, man. Not only the story is very-well craft and planned. The Romances are also awesome! I found myself giddy, giddy and happy with Daniel\u2019s romance. Love their tensions actually. See, I don\u2019t even want to tell you guys who is the heroine! lol For another romance , the romance from Carax\u2019s story is so heart-wrenching. I felt sad, shock, and almost cry. ( If only I haven\u2019t read in public, I think I would cry ) The Bromance is also awesome! The one in Carax\u2019s story and the friendship between Daniel and Ferm\u00edn . Love how loyal Ferm\u00edn is! As much I love Daniel, Ferm\u00edn might be my fave. I just love his wit, I don\u2019t know why? lol! I cannot tell you much since it will be the spoilers.

It started with a real bang: \"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\" is a masterly creation, also the concept of a book choosing an owner. And when Zafon starts telling a story about a book every copy of which mysterious entities are bent on destroying, an author who seems to have disappeared under strange circumstances, and weird characters who seem to have sprung to life from the pages of a romance, the reader is hooked for good.

Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there (for me, at least). The Shadow of the Wind is nothing but an ordinary Gothic Romance with all its attendant paraphernalia. Beautiful heroines, penurious suitors, comic sidekicks, lustful debauchees and loathsome villains populate its pages. We have all the steamy sex scenes, over-the-top dialogues, distressing happenings and graphic violence. The language is suitably flowery and over-rich. Mind you, I do not consider any of this a drawback - I love intellectual junk food as much as the next person. What pissed me off mainly were two things: the book's pretentiousness and its totally unlikable characters (including the protagonist, Daniel Sempere). Let me talk about the second issue first. I felt that none of the characters were well drawn. The author tries his level best to describe them in detail, but it stays just that: description. They don't come to life. And most of them do not raise any empathy in you (the character Zafon has outdone himself on, Fermin, is easily the most obnoxious) - and almost all of them are unabashedly sexist. But the main problem I had was that the novel tries to be something which it is not. It's as though you invite Gabriel Garcia Marquez for dinner, and at the end of the first course, he removes his mask and says: \"April Fool! I'm Dan Brown in disguise!\" Still, I will give it three stars for a fast read which could be enjoyable if you did not approach it with any expectations. Edit to add : I would be guilty of a big sin of omission if I did not mention that I absolutely loved the setting of the book - the Barcelona of the civil war and post-civil war era. I love dystopias, and I believe that Zafon has masterfully captured the essence of a city and nation in the throes of death and rebirth. The three stars are for that, too. ...more I remember taking a Canadian edition with me to vacation in Dubai... And when we went to see Golden souk, instead of, like true female, enjoying all the displayed golden wonders, I found first bench and finished the book, while my family ohed and ahed over so much gold in one place... one of the five best books I've read in last 10 years Here is one for those of us who absolutely adore great literature. It is almost as though The Shadow of the Wind was written for book lovers everywhere. An adrenaline laced, pulse pounding, suspense filled, dark and romantic, gothic adventure, peopled with brilliantly developed, colourful, charismatic and ultimately,unforgetable characters. It really should come with a warning as it will keep you reading late into the night and long after you should have put it down. Fantastic!

It\u2019s really a bit of everything \u2013 coming of age, mystery, tragedy, but ultimately it\u2019s really a book about a book. The Shadow of the Wind reminds me of the movie A Very Long Engagement in atmosphere, mainland Europe in the aftermath of World War I didn't read the blurb of The Shadow of the Wind before I started reading so all I knew was that it had a 4.22 average rating and the title reminded me, well, of farts left on cushions (because I\u2019m really just a 10 year old), but what is it really about?

The Shadow of the Wind reminds me of the movie A Very Long Engagement in atmosphere, mainland Europe in the aftermath of World War II, when the world sought closure and struggled for the normalcy as known before the war. During this time in Barcelona, Daniel Sempere is chosen as the keeper of the book titled The Shadow of the Wind by an unknown author Julian Carax, and because Daniel Sempere is one of us, he sets to find the rest of the author\u2019s works. In his search, he soon discovers the tragedy that is Julian Carax and the mystery that is Lain Coubert. With the unraveling of the secrets surrounding The Shadow of the Wind is the juxtaposition of events in Daniel\u2019s life. Props to Lucia Graves for the wonderful work, really, it\u2019s quite hard to tell that this is a translation, but I\u2019d still give my left lung to read this in Spanish, if only I understood Spanish. The writing is beautiful, the parallel stories woven skillfully and the mystery pretty much remained under wraps until the last 80% or so. My only issue is that it gets quite long winded at times, especially the part when (view spoiler) [Nuria spills her guts, no pun intended, through a letter to Daniel. In that letter she tells her story, and in that story she tells Miquel\u2019s and Miquel tells that of Jorge\u2019s and so on. So meta, yeah? (hide spoiler) ] My favorite character in this novel is Daniel. He's a little awkward, a little bit of a dawg, and stubborn as only a teenager can be. Julian , I did not like very much, not because he is a walking tragedy, but because he\u2019s rather a little too good given his craptastic life. The character I didn\u2019t quite get though is Miquel, (view spoiler) [mainly because of his compulsion to sacrifice everything for Julian. I know they\u2019re bros, but after years of personal tragedy, shouldn\u2019t self-preservation kick in before friendship? So yeah, I like characters who feel human - generally good but a little selfish. (hide spoiler) ] Overall though, I found the characters well-developed. This book has a lot of witty quotes and lessons on love, life, friendship and misery. I won\u2019t rob you of the pleasure of discovering them yourself, but please indulge me to impart one of the lessons I got from The Shadow of the Wind, and that is to always lock the damned door when you do the nasty. It saves everyone the awkwardness, possibly even trauma, and the disruption of a pleasurable activity.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more", "Title": "The Shadow of the Wind"},
