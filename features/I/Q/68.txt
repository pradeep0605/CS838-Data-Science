{"Comments": "Wow! I felt like a 13 year old reading the final installment of Harry Potter. Other than bathroom breaks and a quick dinner, I did not put this book down. <---A>Jeffrey Archer</---A> is a master with characters, twists and storys within storys. I am going to write a novel like this as soon as I can! In an interview included in my edition of this book, James Archer (<---B>born 1940</---B>) said that this novel is a contemporary retelling of Alexander Dumas The Count of Monte Cristo. Since I have not read yet the said classic book, I checked its synopsis in Wikipedia. It seems that Archer did a good job by using the plot but making it current by putting his personal touch on it. Among the different literary genres, I must admit that suspense thriller and romance are my least favorites. I love reading read In an interview included in my edition of this book, James Archer (born 1940) said that this novel is a contemporary retelling of Alexander Dumas The Count of Monte Cristo. Since I have not read yet the said classic book, I checked its synopsis in Wikipedia. It seems that Archer did a good job by using the plot but making it current by putting his personal touch on it. Among the different literary genres, I must admit that suspense thriller and romance are my least favorites. I love reading read fiction, classics, memoirs and children's. Sometimes, I also pick up books belonging to sci-fi,<---M> young adult</---M>, travel, and history but I rarely read suspense thriller and romance. I think the main reason is that these two follow certain formulas and the author should only inject the plot, characters, milieu, conflicts, climax, denouement and conclusion. One cannot deviate from the formula since readers who go to the bookstore know what they want. As examples, in suspense thriller, the issue must be resolved in the end while in romance, the boy and the girl should end up together. In other words, they should have T\"happy\" endings. In fact, among the 500 novels I've read, I've only read: Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code , Angels and Demons and The Lost Symbol ;Ken Folett's The Eye of the Needle , Hornet's Nest and Whiteout ; John Le Carre's The Spy Who Came in From Cold ; Ian Fleming's Casino Royale ; Vince Flynn's Protect and Defend ; John Grisham's The Appeal and Robert Ludlum's The Ambler Warning. For me, among all of those, <+++>A Prisoner of Birth</+++> is one of the best, maybe comparable to those works by Le Carre and Fleming. Archer is definitely better than Flynn, Ludlum and Grisham. Archer is said to be the British equivalent of the American Grisham.<---F> I do not agree with this</---F>. For me, Archer is better than Grisham. <---C>Danny Cartwright</---C> is an illiterate man who is about to get married to Beth Wilson . However, on the night of Danny's proposal to Beth, a drunk military man Spencer Craig kills Beth's brother Bernie Wilson who is with the couple on that night. Spencer is with his 3 other friends who are all influential and the court gives weight on their testimonies in favor of Spencer. So even if Danny is innocent, the jury gives him a guilty verdict: imprisonment of 22 years. In prison, Danny meets his lookalike Nicholas Moncrieff who is an ex-soldier and an only scion of a rich businessman. Nicholas taught Danny on how to read, write and act like him. However, Nicholas is killed by a fellow prisoner and this gives opportunity for Danny to pretend to be Nicholas and see the outside world as a free man earlier than the completion of his sentence. What follows is how he takes revenge over the 4 men who has wronged him and his fiancee. Very engaging, detailed court scenes. I have not been into an actual court hearing so I appreciated how Archer depicted in details the court drama. The prison scenes are likewise very realistic and in the same interview, Archer said that he based everything on his own experienced. Archer was also imprisoned in 2001-2003 for perjury and perverting the course of justice. (Source: Wikipedia) My only question are there still illiterate people in London? . I mean, in the Philippines, which is a third-world country, illiterates seem to be too few that in my 46 years in the country, I only met one no-read, no-write person so far. Other than this, this novel is highly recommended for all suspense-thriller fans. If you love Grisham, I am telling you: Archer is better. ...more As a friend very rightly put it\u2026 \u2019<+++>A Prisoner of Birth</+++>\u2019 has all the makings of a Bollywood Masala Movie. Danny Cartwright , a humble East-End mechanic has just proposed to his childhood sweet heart Beth. He decides to celebrate by treating his fianc\u00e9e and best-friend Bernie Wilson (who also happens to be Beth\u2019s brother) at an upmarket bar \u2018The Dunlop Arms\u2019. Also present at the bar, are a drunken party of four men, who started passing lewd comments at Beth and raise Bernie\u2019s ire. Despite Danny\u2019s prot As a friend very rightly put it\u2026 \u2019A Prisoner of Birth\u2019 has all the makings of a Bollywood Masala Movie. Danny Cartwright , a humble East-End mechanic has just proposed to his childhood sweet heart Beth. He decides to celebrate by treating his fianc\u00e9e and best-friend Bernie Wilson (who also happens to be Beth\u2019s brother) at an upmarket bar \u2018The Dunlop Arms\u2019. Also present at the bar, are a drunken party of four men, who started passing lewd comments at Beth and raise Bernie\u2019s ire. Despite Danny\u2019s protests, the two parties decide to take the fight out into a back-alley..and what follows is something that changes Danny\u2019s life forever. Danny is charged with the murder of Bernie\u2026\u2026a crime he never committed. Despite the best efforts of his able lawyer, the young and relatively untried Alex Redmayne \u2026\u2026Danny is sentenced to twenty-two years at the maximum-security Belmarsh Prison. After all who would take the word of a grubby mechanic over a stalwart quartet of an upcoming barrister, a leading actor, a member of the aristocrat and the youngest partner of an established firm? Danny\u2019s long sentence is made bearable due to his two cell mates: Sir Nicholas Moncrieff , who looks and behaves more like an officer than an inmate. And running-more-true-to-form, the rough and rugged, heavily-built Big Al . Nicholas bears a startling resemblance to Danny and herein lies the crux. When Nick is accidentally murdered, just a few weeks before his release\u2026Danny (with careful mechanisations by Big Al) walks out a free man\u2026as Nicholas Moncrieff. \"Act like Nick.Think like Danny.\" Constantly keeping this in mind\u2026\u2026Danny launches into an intricate and well-planned revenge. A page-turner with certain implausible points. Look-alike Nicholas Moncrieff seemed to be aware from the beginning that his identity was for the sole-purpose of being used to prove Danny\u2019s innocence. He trained him in all the niceties and etiquettes which a Moncrieff should exhibit in genteel society. He educated Danny and even conveniently maintained well-transcribed diaries which proved to be valuable evidence in the later trials. A post-Belmarsh Danny appears to lead a charmed life. All the people he hopes to have on his side, unflinchingly accept that he is indeed Sir Nicholas Moncrieff, never once cross-checking the fact. While Danny Cartwright is a likeable hero, his transformation from the wronged East-Ender to a polished and articulate businessman is a little too good to be true. At the end of the day, I enjoyed the cast of supporting characters: Big Al, Alex Redmayne\u2019s father; rt. Hon. Sir Matthew Redmayne KCMG QC , who handles Danny\u2019s case in the end\u2026and ofcourse, the wise Scottish solicitor Mr.Fraser Munro . I particularly liked the miniscule speech Mr.Munro gives towards the end of his testimony: \u201cI have discovered with advancing years that few things are entirely black or white, but more often different shades of grey. I can best sum it up, My Lord, by saying that it was an honour to have served Sir Nicholas Moncrieff and it has been a privilege to work with Mr.Cartwright. They are both oaks, even if they were planted in different forests. But then, m\u2019lord, we all suffer in our different ways from being prisoners of birth\u201d. In all, an interesting saga with an Indian tadka... ...more .\u0643\u0644 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0646\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0641 \u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628

More than the first half of the book had some merit, but it was only about build up, promise, and expectation. All three undercut, broken, and betrayed, respectively. If a restaurant makes you wait for so long that you're not faint of hunger but bored, impatient, and surly, do you feel satisfied in any way when a bunch of tripe is served to you? Of course(no pun intended) not; that is not sweetening the deal. This modern imagining of The Count Of Monte Christo is by contrast more barbaric than the original. The manner in which Beth's(the new Mercedes) and Danny's(Edmond)critical reunion is not depicted at all, is not a device or technique of the writer, but an admission that he doesn't have the talent or daring to write a true emotional scene that if pulled off, could have earned deserved plaudits for Archer. I almost forgot to mention how my ability to suspend disbelief snapped when reading this. I now know why so many book aficionados despise Archer...he has little respect for his readers. For me he's a very good storyteller, but he must have been stoned when planning for A Prisoner of Birth. How ironical it is that a story of an impostor is itself an impostor to Dumas pere's work. ...more 'A Prisoner Of Birth' by Jeffrey Archer is a modern retelling of the classic 'The Count Of Monte Christo' .

The book follows story of a man who is wrongly convicted and now willing to extract revenge . Sadly I have to say that I found this book the weakest among the books I read by Archer . It seemed that Jeffrey Archer ran out of ideas while writing this novel ( A look alike prisoner , seriously ) . Many of the incedents in the novel are needlessly put and these incedentes slows down the pace of the story . This was the slowest moving story by Archer I have ever read . The book is divided into five parts and in these parts almost every chapter has many weakly built characters and many loopholes . The one thing that I liked about Jeffrey Archer was stout character building but this novel is full of lame characters . Even the character of protagonist was not well built . All other characters were appearing over long intervals . Overall A Weak Book . 2 Stars . ...more My father lent me this book, and I hadn\u2019t even realised Jeffrey Archer was writing again. I previously read his Kane & Abel series which were really good, but that was quite a long time ago, and I struggle to remember things that far back!

I wasn\u2019t disappointed. It really is a page turner, and yet at the same time there is so much detail that does nothing other than get you right into the heart of the book. The descriptions of life in prison are incredible, and clearly taken from his real life experience. Apparently this book is a reworking of the classic Count of Monte Cristo, which I am only vaguely aware of. I will have to give that one a go. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything by giving too much plot away, but it is safe to say Danny is wrongly convicted of murder and goes to great lengths to try and prove his innocence. That\u2019s as much as I can say because I recommend this book to one and all and don\u2019t want to give anything away. ...more \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u062c\u064a\u0641\u0631\u064a

Not an Archer fan I was happy to find one of his books that I could enjoy. A Prisoner of Birth was a fairly good book. The plot was very interesting and intriguing. I did find that a couple of parts were a little bit farfetched, but still enjoyable. Danny was a deep and complex character, but was the only character I felt was developed for the reader. Some sections were slow, but I found that if you pushed past them you found out important details. I liked the European setting that was explored as it was not the parts of London books and movies often focus on. I recommend A Prisoner of Birth to anyone looking for a good drama and any Archer fans.

Jeffrey Archer did a great job of creating a story line that was interesting and characters that were compelling. I enjoyed the writing and the drama very much, it was suspenseful even though predictable.

There were so many ups and downs in this novel. I got swept up in the emotions of the characters and actually got so upset when things weren't going well for the protagonist, Danny Cartwright, I had to take a break; which didn't last long. I can't wait to start another one of Jeffrey Archer's masterpieces. I thought his modern version of Cain and Abel was good, but this takes it to another level. He is not recognized enough for how smart, modern, humorous, and witty his writing is. It's been a long time since I've been able to say \" Wow! That was SUCH a good book!\" Thank you Jeffrey Archer.

It is definitely a book with religious undertones, but being an agnostic I still share the messages this book postulates, namely the spirit of those rules of peaceful co-existence - charity of spirit and charity with money. The religious messages and episodes are of a mundane nature, not of a proselytizing nature. Their presence is to confirm the idea of fairness and justice, and not the doctrine of 'the winner takes it all'.

But when the prosecution witnesses happen to be a group of four upper-crust college friends\u2015a barrister, a popular actor, an aristocrat, and the youngest partner in an established firm's history\u2015who is going to believe Danny's side of the story? Danny is sentenced to twenty-two years and sent to Belmarsh prison, the highest-security jail in the land, from where no inmate has ever escaped. But Spencer Craig, Lawrence Davenport, Gerald Payne, and Toby Mortimer all underestimate Danny's determination to seek revenge\u2015and the extent to which his fiancee Beth will go in pursuit of justice. My Thoughts: The result of the intriguing trial...which sees a novice defense lawyer against a well seasoned and skilled prosecutor...is a 22-year sentence for Danny. However Danny is lucky enough to share a cell with Sir Nicholas Moncrieff, who teaches him the ins and outs of surviving prison life. Danny learns well and begins to plot a scheme to enact his pound of flesh on the three men responsible not only for the death of his best friend but in a large part to Danny's 22 year sentence for a crime that all readers know....he didn't commit. Just when you think you have things figured out...Archer throws us an ending you just won\u2019t see coming. Anyone that thrives on courtroom dramas will find this book irresistible. ...more Having read most of Jeffrey Archer\u2019s work, I would rank this novel among his top-tier. That\u2019s pretty good considering he is the author of As the Crow Flies and Kane and Abel , both among my all-time favorite novels. As others have said, (and in fact, the author himself), this novel is a loose re-imagining of Alexandre Dumas \u2019 The Count of Monte Cristo , brought forward into modern day England. Novels of false imprisonment and subsequent revenge on the conspirators are always compared to Dumas\u2019 mast Having read most of Jeffrey Archer\u2019s work, I would rank this novel among his top-tier. That\u2019s pretty good considering he is the author of As the Crow Flies and Kane and Abel , both among my all-time favorite novels. As others have said, (and in fact, the author himself), this novel is a loose re-imagining of Alexandre Dumas \u2019 The Count of Monte Cristo , brought forward into modern day England. Novels of false imprisonment and subsequent revenge on the conspirators are always compared to Dumas\u2019 masterpiece but this time, the novel stands fully on its own and is quite an enjoyable read. Much like Dumas\u2019 protagonist, Edmond Dantes, Danny Cartwright is a working class man engaged to be married but arrested for a murder he did not commit. Most of the first third of the novel is devoted to his time in jail as he works towards winning his parole hearing and it is great fun to watch him learn the ropes from his two cell mates who would become instrumental in his eventual escape, revenge, and redemption. This is a fairly lengthy book and there are a lot of courtroom scenes which in a lesser author\u2019s hands could become dull and repetitive. But the story and the characters have been so well drawn and the complex revenge plot so well constructed that those scenes serve to enhance the tension and drew me to the edge of my seat. It helped that Danny\u2019s escape and revenge scheme was not perfect and was not saved by simple good luck but rather drew on the relationships he was able to build with those around him. Another nice one from Jeffrey Archer, a controversial figure in his own right, but one who has lived a life much like a character from one of his own books. Perhaps his own legal entanglements, courtroom appearances, and prison time has led to such powerful storytelling. Sometimes he hits and sometimes he misses but he remains one of my go-to authors. ...more Jeffery Archer released his latest novel entitled \u201cA Prisoner of Birth\u201d and is now available in paperback. The title was most apt for the storyline that was written. I spent past few days reading it and I could hardly leave the book.

The storyline captivates you and you just wanted to read till the end to see how it develops and ends. That explains why I have not been able to blog for the week. Jeffrey Archer still has his magic and able to weave a story that has its fair share of unexpected twists and turns. However, at most times, you would have expected the outcomes that you intended. In this case, it pampers and writes for the readers in mind. Jeffrey Archer\u2019s stint in the prison came through very well in the book. I believed that allowed him to write with such authority and convictions in that part of the story. It is real and believable. It takes personal experience, though not so pleasant and even traumatic, for writer immersed in the situation to write that well. As I journeyed with the lead character in the story, I became the character wanting to do what he set out to do. Jeffrey Archer's major strength is in writing witty exchanges in the various criminal court hearings. You have to read it to appreciate and savour the power of the English language used, which is his native tongue. ...more I've been a fan of Archer for quite some time now. My favorites have included Kane & Abel, Not a Penny More Not a Penny Less, As the Crow Flies, and his prison diaries. This is his second novel since being released from prison, having served two years for perjury. I found those journals fascinating, as I did with this book.

The premise of the book is: Danny Cartwright is convicted of murdering his best friend, who also happens to be his soon-to-be brother-in-law. Even though his fiance was there and testified, the other four witnesses convinced the jury to convict Danny. Danny determines to seek revenge on each of the four witnesses, one of whom Danny knows is the real killer. The book has shades of Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, but does not even come close to the intricate plot twists and turns. More disappointing was the book jackets promise of a shocking ending. Archers unexpected plot twists are what I have enjoyed most about his books but this book does not have those. It is quite predictable. Even the ending is not shocking as promised. Still, it was interesting. Especially the first half of the book detailing Danny's prison days. ...more This book was definitely a page turner, and really interesting plot, but there were just some things that bugged me. Maybe I'm just a cynic, but it's seemed awful convenient to have Danny's cell mate become him best friend, and happened to look exactly like him, to the point that his family wouldn't even be able to tell the difference. And I thought it was a little trailer trashy that the girlfriend was 6 months pregnant at his first trial, then after a 4 day rendevous, ends up 6 months pregnant This book was definitely a page turner, and really interesting plot, but there were just some things that bugged me.

And I thought it was a little trailer trashy that the girlfriend was 6 months pregnant at his first trial, then after a 4 day rendevous, ends up 6 months pregnant at his last trial. And why didn't Big Al get upset that he only got 10,000 pounds of Nick's millions, and Danny got the whole estate, when Al had worked with him for years before prison, and known him much longer. I would've felt a little slighted. Other than that, though, the book was really enjoyable. ...more I enjoy Jeffrey Archer books so much, including this one. This was a modern 'Count of Monte Cristo' which I loved. Jeffrey Archer can weave a great story. I'm always pulled in to the twists and turns. He also creates rich characters that also lead me along. I liked the MC in this one. I also liked the antagonists in this one. He built them up so much. I was eager with anticipation to see how hard they would fall. The suspense was great.

I thought of him to be a great and blockbuster writer owing to his extreme fan-following, but I must say the book both in plot and in writing disappointed me. The plot, though interesting, is too ideal and unrealistic. Most of what happens with the hero (for I don't remember his name now) need huge amount of luck and excellent fate to execute. Plus, I found the writing weak too. The characters were great though and memorable too. I wish this is one of Its the first and only Jeffrey Archer I read.
