Well, frak me, spank my petunia and call me Susie!! If your Jericho Barrons, that is. He could call me Susie, Fiona, Mac (Miss Lane if your nasty). Whatever the hell he wants to call me.

Seriously, some of the other girls have already agreed with me that we need to find this man and spank him. So, who's with me? SO SAY WE ALL! Sorry, I know I keep throwing Battlestar Galactica references in her but I only because I love these books so much! They are EPIC.<---F> Epic like Battlestar</---F>. Oh by the way, Barrons, who's your favorite little rascal? Is it................ Spanky?? One of my favorite scenes between Barrons and Mac: He shakes me. \"Say my name.\" \"No.\" \"Damn it, would you just cooperate.\" \"I do not know that word, 'cooperate.' \" \"Obviously,\" he growls. \"I think you make up words.\" \"I do not make up words.\" \"Do, too.\" \"Do not.\" \"Too.\" \"Not.\" I laugh. \"Woman, you make me crazed,\" he mutters. A perfect summary of their relationship. Simple, yet intensely complicated. Okay so I'm not usually a strictly romance or erotic book reader. I like some tenderness to my meatballs. I do NOT like them overdone. This is faaaaar from overdone. There was tons of set-up and build-up before anything close to an explicit scene happens and even THEN, it is still under certain unnamed extenuating circumstances. And the tension and passion is honestly the most intense thing I have yet to read. If you are at all uncomfortable reading about sexual situations, then this is not for you. Not at all. Maybe the first three, but then, by the time you get to this one -- you may be changing your tune. This woman really knows how to throw spikes at you at exactly the right moment, making you unable to dodge them. She loves her cliffhangers, and I am hanging on every word. Up until chapter three, I was a little ticked. I did not like the alternate perspective that we were getting. The thoughts were fragmented and childish. I like her as a character but not as a perspective character. After that, geez, I was going crazy. Barrons is so effing hot. When she describes the sound he makes.... Whew! Anyway..... I think a visual aid is in order. Hummina, hummina. Humminaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I'm sorry but I had to post this guy, too. He has the long hair. And look at those eyes . [image error] I didn't like it at all when Barrons wasn't around for so long, and that was more often then I had expected. But this whole series moves ridiculously fast, so it doesn't phase me as much as I always think it will. It's the anticipation that keeps me going. And the ending: WHAT THE EFFING HELL?????? GRUMBLE, GRUMBLE. A recurring thought seems to be: \"How can this possibly get ANY better!\" and then it does. Another recurring thought: \"How can this possibly get ANY worse?\" and then it does . I had to start Shadowfever before I wrote this review, because I had to at least know if it was who I thought it was. And that better not be permanent or I will hate KMM forever! I'm not happy about the ending but I'm happy about the book, and the series, and generally about my love for Barrons! Well, back to my happy dance. And if you want to be happy too then READ THIS SERIES!!! I'm doing the happy dance but I'm not happy about it. Yeah, okay. So this is more of a scared and reserved happy dance but it sums up how I felt at the end..... My review for the first book, Darkfever . Spoiler FREE. For the second book, Bloodfever .

This was an excellent book, as all the others are, with deep and interesting characters, character growth, a brave new world to explore with excellent writing, as I've come to expect from Ms. Moning. Rich in language (though I wish she'd ease up on two words: demarcation and irrevocably (I wish OTHER authors would stop abusing the latter as well but that's a story for another day)). The book is fast paced, action packed and full of the kind of rich, original and immersive story each of the previous books have enjoyed. I thoroughly recommend this series. Except for the freakin' endings! This book has the worst case of cliff-hanger fever I've ever seen! KMM, the last book better wrap up nice and neat or I am seriously going to lose my cool. ...more WTH? Who ends books like this? What was the point?

As if I wouldn't read Shadowfever without this awful cliffhanger. Dreamfever 's cliffhanger ending really touched my nerve. I was barely able to tolerate Faefever 's mid-scene cut-off, mainly because I had the next installment readily available to me, but this time I have to wait for almost 6 months to see what happens! Pardon my language, but that's a fecked up thing to do to the readers! Ok, I am going to calm down now. Dreamfever starts where Faefever left off. Mac is in the hands of 3 Unseelie Princes and one unknown entity and is being turned Pri-ya. She is almost dead and finally saved by none other than Dani. Soon Barrons shows up to get a hold of his OOP detector and to administer his special Pri-ya \"medicine.\" He succeeds, and Mac emerges after her ordeal, once again, a changed person. What follows is familiar to us non-stop chase for the Book, the Hallows, the answers, only this chase is more urgent because the world is literally crumbling down under the assault of the Unseelie. Dreamfever is another very readable book full of excellent lore, mysterious characters and adventure. At the same time this installment caused me more angst than any other book in the Fever series. It is dark, dark, dark. Pri-ya Mac and her \"relationship\" with Barrons totally depressed me, because I love the two together and simply hated to see them finally get together in such a messed-up way. My other complaints are in tune with those of other readers: - Give me some answers finally! I've read 4 books out of 5 and I still have more questions than answers. How can they all be answered in the last book? - The structure of the last two books in not satisfying. They don't read like separate books and should have been plotted tighter. For instance, Dani's chapters in Dreamfever were totally unnecessary. Too much plodding around and no sufficient build-up to climaxes. And the cliffhangers! In spite of my complaints, I still enjoyed the book immensely and dying to finally have all my questions answered. I just hope Moning will be able to deliver the ending that will meet all readers' expectations. P.S. It better NOT be Barrons! ...more 4.5 stars WOW, great start to this one.

For example, seeing Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen (Legolas and Aragorn, to the uninformed---I weep for you) standing next to Peter Jackson.

I didn't know that I could be so rudely jolted out of a reverie while reading a book until I read the opening chapters of Dreamfever . We start with Mac, who is not Mac, who is Pri-ya , and being raped by the Four Unseelie Princes. She is incoherent with unwanted lust, her mind wrestling with the horrifying effects of fae glamour. Her mind, her body is being violated, she can barely remember who she is. Who the fuck are you? Here on the floor, in my final moments\u2014<---C>MacKayla Lane</---C>\u2019s last grand hurrah\u2014I see that the answer is all I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m nobody. The situation is appalling, and I an rather outraged at myself for loving her inner monologue in this moment, but it can't be helped. Mac's voice, her inner thoughts, are so beautifully written that I am at doubts with myself. And then---like a hopelessly lost marching band that has somehow wandered into a Rachmaninoff concerto, Dani appears. Well, feck me! How diddly ho, dudes! We're gonna fecking hunt us some fecking fey right fecking NOW with my supercool supersword!! As I said. Discordance . 10 pages later, I'd had it. It was only after a friend told me that Dani was only the narrator for the first few chapters that I picked it up again. My god, Ms. Moning, I don't know whether to hate you or to congratulate you on the fact that you wrote a character so convincingly annoying that I wanted to strangle her on the spot. Did I ever hate Mac for using petunias and daisies as swear words? I take it back. Fecking this and fecking that takes the fucking cake for pissing me off every time. I question the presence and the age of Dani in the novel, I really do. Was it so necessary to make her 13 years old? Was it so necessary to insert a girl who is little more than a child into a book that is so utterly adult in its darkness, in its intensity, in its sexuality? Was it so necessary to make her so utterly immature and at the same time, so completely competent in her capabilities and super(ha!)natural abilities? I understand that Mac needs someone to care for, that she needs someone relatively uncomplicated (because Barrons and V'lane is more than any woman can simultaneously handle) to look after, to be an alternate sibling. I understand that Dani's shell is a cover, in parts, for her dark past, for being forced to grow old before her time. But 13 year old Dani, really? I would raise an eyebrow at the insertion of a 16-year old companion to Mac. But a 13 years old...and such a caricature of an annoying, overly sexual teenager. It is just too much, and I don't know if I can handle the next book if there is more of Dani, in the role of narrator, in it. I really don't know how to feel about this book, and maybe that is part of the series' charms . I absolutely loved the first 50% of the book, I absolutely hated the utter pointlessness of the Silver in the last 25%. I loved Mac and her bravery, I was there with her as she struggles with herself, her distant, vague recollections, her struggles with memory, her amnesia, her inexplicable distress at hearing the word \"sister.\" I was intrigued when observing black Mac, Mac 4.0 . I enjoyed seeing her wrestle, often with futility, verbally and physically (and sexually) with Barrons. I cheered when Mac returned to us. I always love it when I see my heroine snap out of a \"state,\" be it comatose, be it grieef, be it amnesia. That moment when she wakes up, and gets ready to kick some fucking ass is a thing of beauty. With an explosive inhalation, I snap upright in bed, and my eyes fly open\u2014like coming alive after being dead and interred in a coffin. I am Mac. And I\u2019m back. And she is pissed. Understandably so. Fucking Barrons. Fucking V'lane. Fucking useless, the lot of them. One of the rare moments in which I actually agreed with Dani is her observation of how completely fucking useless Barrons had been in protecting Mac. And Barrons\u2014what\u2019s his deal? Doesn\u2019t he want her alive? Why have they all abandoned her when she needs \u2018em the most? Men. Dude, they suck. I had hoped that this would be the book that settled it once and for all: is Khanh on Team Barrons? Nope, he's still a complex douchebag to me. If anything I'm even MORE confused on how I feel towards him. On the one hand, he did something pretty despicable in my eyes: he sleeps with Mac, without her consent. It was Mac, but it was not Mac. Mac was under a spell, she was Pri-ya , driven almost insane by the fae, and is now in a desperate state of lust. Mac has amnesia, she does not remember anything. It took Barrons weeks to reteach her English. Yet he has sex with her anyway. \u201cI was out of my mind. I\u2019d never have done it otherwise.\u201d Really, his dark eyes mocked, and in them I was demanding more, telling him I wanted it to always be this way. I remembered what he\u2019d replied: that one day I would wonder if it was possible to hate him more. \u201cI had no awareness. No choice.\u201d I searched for words to drive my point home. \u201cIt was every bit as much rape as what the Unseelie Princes did to me.\u201d I agree with her. One may argue that it's pretty hard to resist a naked girl who's crawling around begging to be fucked, but this is Jericho fucking Barrons; I expect better of him, I have higher expectations of him. He had never crossed that line with Mac before, and he let me down by doing so now, and I think I hate him more as a result. Yes, what he did to help Mac recover her memories was pretty sweet, he painted her nails, he replicated her room, etc. It's not enough. He didn't have to screw Mac without her conscious consent. The last half of this book was a letdown. It felt random as hell, and I felt there was no point to plopping Mac smack in the middle of another realm. She also made a pretty dumb decision that I thought was more Mac 1.0 than Mac 4.0, she knows how valuable she is, she knows the Lord Master is baiting her, and she decides to take the bait because of her chivalrous need to save her parents. I want Mac 3.0 back. Is it wrong of me to want more destruction? The world is in pieces, but it never felt like it . I wanted more descriptions of the horror. I wanted more blood, more death. Instead, I got a freaking World After scenario in the Aerie with freaking human girl groupies waiting to pleasure the fucking (I keep wanting to say fecking now, thanks a lot, Dani) Fae. The destruction of the world never felt enough, it never felt completely urgent, it never felt horrifying to me. Maybe I'm just immune to violence now, but I wanted more of it. It was still a good book, but I feel very let down by the actions of the characters of whom I had grown fond. ...more You tried, you really did.

Would you claw and scrape your way back to yourself, evolve into a creature that could stand on its own two feet, look the monsters in the eye and roar at them in defiance? In Dreamfever we learn Mac\u2019s answers to these questions. We see her fight her way back from the oblivion that is Priya with the aid of a man she never thought she could trust. What emerges from the cocoon they create is a creature we\u2019ve only caught glimpses of before. Savage Mac is here. And she hates pink. In the early books Mac devoted massive amounts of time to painting her nails, matching accessories to rainbow colored outfits and spewing sunshine and flowers from her mouth. Always the optimist, never willing to let anyone\u2019s cynicism browbeat her into frowning, Mac was a happy person, even while her life was going to hell. Now\u2026not so much. Now she chooses to wear uninterrupted black leather because it\u2019s easy to sponge someone else\u2019s death off the material and blood stains don\u2019t show on it. Her accessories come in the form of automatic weapons and hard steel and she goes from spouting charming southern anecdotes to this: \u201cI could trust no one. Rely on nothing but myself.\u201d \u201cI would never count on him again but I would use him if I could.\u201d This book is non-stop from the opening to the gut-wrenching cliffhanger it ends with. It doesn\u2019t give you a single moment to just stop and take a fecking breath . It\u2019s gritty, it\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s infuriating. It answers none of your questions and leaves you yearning for even more answers than before. You\u2019ll get them in the next book.

It is something I have encountered in one too many books lately. That's what really bothered me in Dreamfever.I absolutely love the Fever series and had grown extremely fond of Mac and her gradual coming of age,of strenghts.A painful,humiliating incident takes that slow and realistic development and turns into a full 180-degree turn.It's cliched.It's redundant. I am not okay with sexual abuse in books, but that is a personal preference and I don't consider it a minus of the novel. What I am not okay with is when it is used so readily as a plot and character device. Mac not only loses her mind,she suffers a complete and utter tranformation. She is now a \"badass\", a sarcastic, leather-clad, cynical chick.I do not understand why such a change would need to occur in the first place,but even so, the manner of it was downright insulting to me. That said, have another confession.I really hate Jericho Barrons.::ducks for cover:: I know,I know,I'm probably the only one but I cant' help it.The guy just pisses me off.I swear a part of me kept screaming \"Just pound his dark-eyed,high-cheekboned,fully-lipped face in!*Not* a time to be an adult!\" Yes, throughout the series we are treated into tantalising little insights to his character and his true feelings,and I have to admit that Jericho is indeed a most intriguing and thorough creation.But I absolutely don't consider him a good romantic interest. He is harsh, cruel and outright abusive to Mac. The mocking comments about Mac's gang rape and her subsequent loss of self? I was horrified. Horrified . I get where he's coming from,but that is no excuse. I used to love these books, I really did,and perhaps that's why this installment disappointed me so much.

Was he letting me see this, or had intimacy given me a window into his soul. As if he had one. He deserved no less. He hadn\u2019t done it to save me. He\u2019d had sex with me because it was the only way he could continue using me. He\u2019d had sex with me to steal my services back from his enemies at Camp Pri-ya. And for the first time since the morning he\u2019d gotten up and walked out, leaving me painfully, horrifically aware of both who I was and where I was\u2014in Jericho Barron\u2019s lust-drenched bed on the verge of begging him not to leave me while in full possession of my senses--I could see that it hadn\u2019t left him nearly as untouched as I\u2019d thought. As he\u2019d led me to think. I searched his face. Beneath his left eye, a tiny muscle contracted, smoothed, contracted again. That minute betrayal was Barron\u2019s equivalent of a normal person having a full-blown hissy fit. Oh, no, far from untouched. Had he stood outside my door as I\u2019d stood outside his, fists at his sides, lips drawn back? Did it have him as bad as it had me? Was it eating at him, gnawing at him with the same sharp vicious little teeth that wouldn\u2019t let me sleep? Yes, it was. I could see the rage of insatiable, uninvited lust in every line of that dark, stoic face that had once been too subtly etched for me to read. I wasn\u2019t the only one lying awake at night, fevered with memories, tossing, turning, soaking my sheets, burning up--not for Fae sex, but him, damn it all to hell, him. Remembering being too naked in body and soul, trembling with need. Backing to him, a wild animal. Later, straddling him, holding him down and demanding more and more because Jericho Barrons couldn\u2018t be depleted. Of anything. Whatever he was. He was without limit. He hadn\u2019t erased the Fae Princes\u2019 marks--he\u2019d burned his own into them until I could no longer discern the shape of the marks they\u2018d left. He\u2018d scarred their scars out of me with a bigger scar. The bastard. And if I\u2019d managed to carve up some part of him in return\u2014 \u201cGood,\u201d I said, hard and low. \u201cWelcome to my world, Barrons. I hope it hurts like hell.\u201d His hand was on my throat and my back was to the wall. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I didn\u2019t need to. He was touching me. Two enormous magnets, repelling and attracting; a manifest of nature, not a matter of will at all. The air between us crackled with energy. Did I smell flesh burning? \u201cGood?\u201d he said softly, and staring into those black eyes was like staring down the shadowy, demon-littered corridor of the Unseelie mirror in his study. \u201cYou think it\u2019s good to have something like me obsessed with you? My dear, dear, bloody idiotic, suicidal Ms. Lane, you have no fucking idea what\u2019s gotten the scent of you in its nostrils, what has the taste of you in its blood, or you\u2019d run. You\u2019d run for what little remains of what you think of as your life.\u201d He whirled, long black coat fluttering, was out the door, and gone. I stared into the deepening twilight into which he\u2019d disappeared. Nightfall was painting the stone walkway one of those new Fae shades that hadn\u2019t existed before the walls had come crashing down around our ears; a dreamy silvery-violet, spider-webbed with moonbeams that was eerily beautiful. I shivered. I hated the new colors. They were\u2026.somehow just\u2026wrong. I shook it off. Obsessed, Barrons had said. I smiled. Good. Okay, and this was deleted why?! It's fecking awesome and HOT ! Original review: Behold, I give to you my reaction to the first 50 pages of Dreamfever : #*$@%*%@$@&$*(@!>?<#&WTF?*faints*#**&^@!$%^#%^7053 .........................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! More on that later. Remember when I said in my review for Darkfever that I wasn't as batshit crazy over Barrons as most people but that I eventually would be? That day has come, my friend. With each book I've grown to love him more and more. I've slowly learned how he operates and slowly become used to his ways of doing things. And let me tell you, they're anything but conventional. Barrons isn't like any leading male character that you will encounter in any genre. Simply put, he's one of a kind. Barrons is the type of character where you have to stay very open minded upon meeting him else you'll be offended almost immediately. I almost was, myself. But patience and keeping an open mind will pay off. The thing about Barrons is, most of the time, he's rude, insensitive, stoic, and, at times, barbaric. But despite all of this he's become one of my very favorite male characters. If Ms. Moning ever chose to write a story solely about him, I'd be the first person at the bookstore to buy it. Mac's character continues to surprise me and she'll always be a favorite of mine. The only idiotic err she made in this was at the end. How could she NOT know that he was the beast? I mean, come on! I started to figure that out in book 1! I thought that that was a simple 2 + 2 = 4 equation, but apparently I was wrong. I don't know what Mac was thinking. Since reading Darkfever I've been thinking that it's Barrons keeping his and Mac's nonexistent relationship from ever becoming something more. I was wrong. Dreamfever shows you something else. In Dreamfever we see that while Barrons is often times aloof and hard for Mac to understand, he's been wanting Mac for quite some time. You see that if Mac would just take her foot out of her ass and take what she really wants (let's be honest with ourselves, she wants Barrons -- Who in their right mind doesn't, anyway?) she'd be a hell of a lot happier and less confused. Besides the beginning that I dare you to only read once, there're quite a few luscious little moments between these two that I really enjoyed. One of them was this: \"I'll snoop anywhere I damned well please, Ms. Lane. I'll snoop inside your skin if I feel like it.\" \"You just try,\" I said, eyes narrowing. He moved forward in one swift, violent lunge but caught him- self and locked down hard. I mirrored the move, without conscious thought at all, as if our bodies were connected by puppet strings. Lunged forward, froze. Fisted my hands at my sides. They wanted to touch him. I looked down. His hands were fisted, too. I uncurled my hands and crossed my arms. He crossed his at exactly the same moment. We both practically flung them down at our sides. We stared at each other. The silence lengthened. You could cut the sexual tension with a knife. I found that scene to be both adorable and frustrating. Dreamfever is easily my favorite of the series thus far because even though it's not under the circumstances I would've liked, Barrons and Mac finally get intimate. And, all jokes aside, I cried during parts of those scenes. This is one of the parts that really got to me: He touches my face. There is something different in his touch. It feels like he's saying good-bye, and I know a moment of panic. But my dream sky darkens and sleep's moon fills the horizon. \"Don't leave me.\" I thrash in the sheets. \"I'm not, Mac.\" I know I am dreaming then, because dreams are home to the absurd and what he says next is beyond absurd. \"You're leaving me, Rainbow Girl.\" If you've read this then you know what that is referring to and you know what it means for Barrons to say something like that. Yep, I'm a complete sap and I'm not afraid to admit it; I went from having totally inappropriate/appropriate feelings while reading that scene to crying to the point where I could no longer make out the words on the page. Any author that can make me feel such contrary emotions juxtaposing within the same scene is at the top tier in my opinion. Bottom line, Dreamfever is fantastic, this whole series is fantastic, and Ms. Moning herself is one fantastic writer. Here's to hoping that Shadowfever won't disappoint. Cheers, fellow Fever fans! ...more [4.5 Stars] OMG THAT ENDING THOUGH Other thoughts: (view spoiler) [My favorite part was when her monster (Barrons, I presume) kept urinating in a circle around her.

Suddenly realizing I did not have a copy of Dreamfever\u2026.OMG\u2026.i wanted it now\u2026.i spent a day trying to find a copy\u2026yes\u2026.it was sold out at most of the bookshops\u2026I even tried secondhand shops..no luck. Eventually I was told 1 copy was available at a bookshop which is miles away from my home\u2026but did that stop me????? Absolutely not\u2026\u2026\u2026.dashed off and that night I again found myself in Dublin and in Mac, Barrons and the Fever World!!!!!!!!!!!!! Couldn\u2019t stop turning the pages\u2026and my love for Mac & Barron kept growing as I continued spending time in their world. Mac\u2019s journey is going through some dark moments but she\u2019s stronger than she was before..and it is this inner strength of hers that she is able to survive being turned Pri-ya (sex slave) by the Unseelie Princes. Having been rescued by Dani (so happy to hear that she\u2019s going to have her own story) and taken to the abbey, where she is imprisoned by the wicked Rowena \u2013 she\u2019s definitely hiding something \u2013 before Mac is rescued by Barrons. The rescue scene is really touching\u2026.confirms how much he cares for her. Mac\u2019s sex addiction is complete and Barrons does everything for her to try and come back from the hell she is at. They are growing closer to each other and to finding the darn book of evil!!!!!!!!!! The human world is quickly being overtaken by the dark Fae\u2026.and Mac, as she comes out of her addiction, discovers more of her powers and is prepared, even more so now, that no one and nothing will step on her quest to attain her quest. There are still so many questions left at the end of this book\u2026..Who and what is Barron\u2019s? Why is he feared so much\u2026even by V\u2019lane\u2026who is more than what he appears to me\u2026.he has some agenda that I feel is going to surprise us. The Lord Master is determined to get something from Mac and even kidnaps her parents to force her hand. What does Mac have that everyone wants it? Who is she really???? I think more than what we are led to believe\u2026more than just a sidhe-seer. She is the catalyst to either the saving or destruction of the human world..and perhaps even the fae as well. The cliffhanger in this book devastated me\u2026\u2026..if I for one moment thought the previous cliffhangers stunned me\u2026\u2026..this one shocked, angered, saddened me. I wanted to scream at the betrayal and lies that caused such pain to Mac. No, this cannot happen I said to myself. Why???? For what reason????? Why didn\u2019t Mac trust Barrons????? The last sentence had me in tears\u2026\u2026..\u201dFor a time, I have no idea where he ends and I begin\u201d. I wish I had the next book, Shadowfever\u2026but the hardcover is sold out and I will have to wait for the paperback edition, which I hope will be soon. I know that it will be an incredible ride and finally have the answers to all our questions in Mac\u2019s story.

But man, the beginning? *drool* Still SO FREAKING HOT! Still my favorite series. Our first annual re-read of the Fever series with the MacHalo group starts October 26, 2015! Here's the schedule (sorry, I can't keep to a schedule with this series - it takes over and I have to devour it once I start): Darkfever: October 26 / Bloodfever: November 9 / Faefever: November 23 / Dreamfever: December 7 / Shadowfever: December 21 / Iced: January 5 / Burned: January 12 New thoughts on the second read: This is pretty much the sidhe-seers book. After we get past the delicious beginning of the book (view spoiler) [ HOW DARE YOU LEAVE THAT ROOM MAC?!?!? (hide spoiler) ] , the whole middle is pretty much about Mac getting to know Dani, Kat, and trying to figure out how to outwit Rowena. It's about her trying to find a way to get the abbey girls to trust her and work with her. I didn't find this as interesting as the first time, but it's still a vital part of the story, and I totally understand why most the book was spent on this. A lot of important information came out about the past, we got more V'lane, Ryodan, and a little of Mac's parents thrown in. My thing is just that all I want to read about is BARRONS , so, yeah, well... he's not in this one enough. Hmmph. The ending was just as crazy-good as the first time. Incredible cliffhanger ending that you just can't read fast enough. Still one of the best urban fantasy series EVAH! Original review: Now that cliffhanger was just a really mean thing to do. BUT OMG I LOVED THIS BOOK. LOVED. LOVED. LOVED. The section with Dani's POV was a little different, especially seeing as how we only heard from her POV one time, in the beginning of the book. She's an interesting character, so it's all good. I am sure there will be more to come from her, that much is obvious. Barrons was epic. In the beginning with Mac... I can't even. I need more answers, though. I want more of him. MORE. I totally understand why Mac would pull away from him and it'd be awkward - after, ahem, everything they did. So much happened and there is still a lot to wrap up. Mac is really shaping up to be quite the badass. What a great heroine. I'm in my happy place with this one. Ok, off to start book 5. Well, maybe I'll do a quick re-read of Mac and Barrons in the beginning first. ;) BARRONS.

In Dreamfever you will get a lot of answers to many earlier questions, and you will form new theories and opinions as to who/what everyone is and what they really want. But you will also be left with a large handful of new questions to ponder for the next book! Oh man! SO am I sorry that I didn't wait until all books were published before reading the series?

She\u2019s definitely one of my favourite heroines in UF. After the ending in Faefever, I nearly lost it. I sprinted to my shelves to grab Dreamfever and read the first two chapters. The emotions rolled through me but still, I found I way to stop myself. I purposely waited until the release of Shadowfever so that I wouldn\u2019t have to wait such a long period between books.With how Dreamfever ended, I\u2019m sooo damn glad I waited this long! Shadowfever is patiently waiting on my ereader at the moment and I am so eager to devour it next! Mac is such a fierce heroine! I absolutely loved reading from her POV. I loved the differences in writing style when she was Pri-ya and then later on for the rest of the book. I don\u2019t think I can rave about her enough! Love her! Then there\u2019s Dani whom I fecking adore! I seriously love this kid. She has some of the best lines in the book. Here\u2019s one of my favourites: \"I been wearing sandals a lot, even though it's cold. What a way to go: death-by-shoe Shade. I grin. I have a black sense of humor. You try living my life, see what color yours turns.\" The fact that some of the early chapters are from her POV was great! I can\u2019t get enough of her! Barrons aka the love of my life - I never thought I would be so infatuated with a fictional character like him, but I am. You can probably guess which my favourite scenes with him were. Probably the most interesting thing was when Mac got glimpses into Barrons mind. So worth reading the series just for those little moments. I could go on forever. Seriously.

It was amazing to be in her head while she was being \"cured\" and see the raw animalism that makes a person pra-ya. It makes us understand the fae world that she has built. It was very cool! World building is definitely not overlooked in this series. One of the best I've ever read. Dani was also much more present in this one and actually had a few chapters in her POV. Dani is 13 years old, and you could tell! Moning wrote her nonchalance and teenage behaviour wonderfully. It served well to differentiate the characters and mindsets. I've read lots of books where there are multiple POVs but they all sort of blend in together. So props to good writing. At this point in the game there is nothing much else to say.

I wound up rereading that chapter four times in a row and I'm not any closer to knowing than I was after the first time. I have some theories but can just as easily talk myself out of them as I can talk myself into them. This was the fourth installment in a series of what will be five and just like last summer after the third came out, I'm left feeling a little strung out.

When Mac and Barrons are having sex together finally, it will be fantastic but it will also be bitter. Because it is not a matter of a mutual decision or because they realize that they love each other. It will be mainly a matter of survival. This is the book where all the major players of the series are finally brought together. All the enemies, friends and lovers (hard to tell who is what still): Barrons and his team (yes, there are a lot like him), Ryodan, Mac, V\u2019lane, Derek O'Bannion, Christian MacKeltar, Rowena, Dani, Kat, the three Unseelie Princes, a strange monster who will have a strange ending and who may be someone we know. This is a fast paced, excellent written, smoothly executed, originality oozed book. Everything and everyone matter in this book. Most of the scenes are worth mentioning. I am picking the most heartbreaking one: He touches my face. There is something different in his touch. It feels like he\u2019s saying good-bye, and I know a moment of panic. But my dream sky darkens and sleep\u2019s moon fills the horizon. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d I thrash in the sheets. \u201cI\u2019m not, Mac.\u201d I know I am dreaming then, because dreams are home to the absurd and what he says next is beyond absurd. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me, Rainbow Girl.\u201d ...more First Re-read: November 2014 \"Now I've lost everything.\" *__* And I just dove in thinking: \"Hey, I know what will happen.

And today I read this review : (view spoiler) [ Rape. There is a lot of rape, attempted rape, and mind rape in this series (so far). Personally, I don't think this author could handle the subjects she was trying to talk about at all. She brushed them under the rug, which means that all of her characters also brushed them under the rug. The male love interest REGULARLY MOCKS THE WOMAN HE \"LOVES\" ABOUT BEING GANG RAPED. This is the man the ladies are pining after. He tells her it was her fault for not calling for help, he jokes that she shouldn't be kissing a Fae because she's had enough Fae in her mouth recently (when she was gang raped), he says that she seems perfectly fine for having been gang raped recently, he continues to humiliate her by bringing up all the times they had sex together when she was basically drugged. When she tells him that he raped her too (WHICH HE DID) (THE EQUIVALENT OF ROOFIES), he tells her that it wasn't rape because she didn't crawl away, she walked away. (hide spoiler) ] Guess what? I don't have much problem with sexual violence in novels, but I'm absolutely sicked of those women have to get raped first before they become badasses cheap plot device and character development (if you can call it that...). Plus, have anyone ever noticed that throughout the first three books of the series, no one seems to show much sympathy nor concern toward those Pri-ya , female fey-seers who are addicted to sex with the feys. You know, feys can use seduction to force themselves on mortals, whether the mortals want it or not. So why shouldn't those Pri-ya be viewed as victims instead of SLUTS who asked for it? So, don't ask me to feel sorry for Mac when none of the characters seems to feel sorry for those Pri-ya in the first three books. No one seems to care that they might just be as helpless and victimized as poor Super Special Innocent Snowflake Mac. Those nameless, faceless Pri-ya do not deserve to be sympathized because they are not Mac, you know. But of coruse, God forbid that sympathy and care to be showed among women, that's how things usually go in this Fever series, women can only hate, slut-shame, be jealous of, try to control each other instead of showing sisterly concern and sympathy, and it sucks. Edited@25/06/2015 Actual review starts here: Looking for great urban fantasy novel series with strong heroine, realistic characters, heart-stopping suspense, brave men and women going up against truly horrible situations, and great battles between good and evil? Well, please look somewhere else, you are not going to find any of these within Dreamfever , book 4 of the best selling Fever series. Yes, right. It's the fourth book already and guess what? Things still aren't getting better. Arguably, it gets worse. Okay...to be fair, the world building and the setting about the deadly Fae and their supernatural realms are still doing great, and this book really isn't as awful as the previous book: Faefever , mostly because there are a decent amount of battle scenes and action scenes with this fourth book (Faefever had even failed to provide us this, nothing happens in Faefever), plus it's nice to see Mac finally taking matter into her own hands. Still Dreamfever continues to be marred by the same old flaws which plagued the previous three books. To make matter worse, new flaws can also be found, such as: Warning: There are unmarked spoilers for the previous book and its ending in the follow part: (1) How rape is handled in the story: You think you are going to read about a heroine surviving the traumatic experience of sexual violence and violation against her free will and body, and rape will be addressed in a meaningful way? Sorry, you had picked up the wrong book. By the end of the previous book, Mac, the main character, was raped by three Unseelie princes and lost her mind. She became addicted to sex with the deadly Fae and became mentally enslaved. Then the Male Lead of this series, the What Is His Name Dangerous Sexy Alpha Male Bad Boy (see? I'm still not going to dignify this guy by remembering his name) came to her rescue and helped restoring Mac to her sanity by...having countless of monkey sex with her until she slowly came to her sense months later. To tell the truth, I'm not against this particulate plot development, but I do know many readers are upset that What's His Name did it with Mac when she lost her mind, which made the guy as much a rapist as those Fae princes who gang raped her. And I fully understand why people are upset about it. However, I still found the scenes with Mac and What's His Name together and how things go between them to be satisfyingly written (especially the nice things What's His Names had done for Mac). I also found Mac a great deal more tolerable when she was crazy and had nothing but sex in her mind. I mean, it's still better than her hateful, judgmental old self (am I a horrible person for saying that?) Then, let me tell you what I truly have problem with. It takes place after Mac came to her sense, then she faced What's His Name once more, only to have the guy insulted her over the fact of her being gang raped. He also went out of his way to remind her *repeatedly* how she had just been recently raped. Not only this, the guy also threw rape jokes at Mac's face, for more than once. (Link: http://www.jpopasia.com/forums/posts-... ) Oh, my goodness. As much as I hate Mac and want a monster to eat her, Mac still doesn't deserve this. It also makes me wonder: is that really the kind of guy whom women from both within and outside of the book are wetting their underpants for? A guy who insults women for being raped? A guy who says BS that basically telling the raped victim: \"You had been careless and unwise, you brought it upon yourself\"? (Link: http://kathy-kyuhyun.deviantart.com/j... ) Not only this, who can forget Kat, a female character's loving remark of \"she (Mac) asked for it\"? Hell, to the no. (2) Too Stupid To Live characters (and Mac is not the only one) By the middle part of the book, Mac and Dani, the two main female characters had done a couple of dumb things, rushing headfirst into dangerous situations without checking and thinking about it first for too many times, it makes me wonder why they still hadn't gotten killed yet. And they are not the only ones. The other sidhe-seers, who hidden themselves in a 'heavily guarded abbey' to avoid the evil Fae and other monsters, are no better. Not only Mac can just went to the abbey, firing a burst of bullets at the handle of the front door and then kicked the door in and then walked into the abbey, simply because those stupid bitch sidhe-seers were so stupid that they just left the front door unguarded and unwatched. Later on, they also just left the side door unguarded so Dani could just slip back in. Later on, Mac, What's His Name and the Fae Prince (I also have no desire to recall his name) had a fight on the hallway, and none of those stupid-bitch sidhe-seers heard anything and came to check on them. That's ridiculous. (3) A lot of stupid things just...happen. I wonder had the author of this book even paused and thought about what she was writing when she created this book? I have a good guess that she hadn't because a lot of stupid things just happen in the story and characters are making some really stupid choices. For example, Mac kept on calling the guy who killed her sister 'LM', short for Lord Master. *facepalms* For example, Mac did not hesitate from drinking a cup of coffee handed to her by the Lord Master LM, a.k.a the evil guy whom arranged for her to be raped and whom she believed had murdered her sister. For example, Mac and Dani repeatedly and publicly disobeyed Rowena, the leader of the sidhe-seers, even stealing important Hallow Objects from her, but they never had to face any consequence. For example, no one seems to suspect (view spoiler) [Rowena for being a traitor, even after she left the sidhe-seers poorly trained, keeping life-saving information from them and then sending them off to the war zone. (hide spoiler) ] For example, Mac became finer shaped and able to kick asses right after she snapped out of her sex-crazed trance. During said trance, she wanted nothing but sex, she didn't even want to eat food. But obviously tons of sex with What's His Name keep her body in shape and better than before. Ladies, let's find a Big Strong Guy and have tons of monkey sex with him! it will make your bodies more healthy and better shaped! (Link: https://www.tumblr.com/search/yamamur... ) (4) Mac is the most Super Special Innocent Snowflake Mary Sue ever. It's an old problem actually, but by now Mac is so special there is a prophecy about her. Give me a break. (5) The ending. Mac was finally going to face the Lord Master LM and save her parents! (view spoiler) [But not really! Suddenly Mac is sent magically to another worlds through the Fae Slivers! So no confrontation between Mac and the villain! (hide spoiler) ] Seriously, what kind of author does this kind of thing by the ending of her book? Whoever had claimed the latter books of the series are better, now I'm holding you responsible for the loss of my time and the death of my brain cells.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more", "Title": "Dreamfever"},
