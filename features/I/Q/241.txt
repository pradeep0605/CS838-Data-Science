It was eye-opening without being preachy or didactic.

Creative Team: Creator, Writer & Illustrator: Marjane Satrapi REVOLUTIONARY WORK I remember the days when we traveled around Europe, it was enough to carry an Iranian passport. They rolled out the red carpet. We were rich before. Now as soon as they learn our nationality, they go through everything, as though we were all terrorists. They treat us as though we have the plague. Persepolis is the masterpiece by Marjane Satrapi, a pseudo-biographical work, illustrating her life since 10 years old (1980) until 24 years old (1994), where she experienced her coming-to-life, in her native Iran, during the Islamic Revolution and the war with Iraq, along with four years in Europe, and her return to Iran again. In this graphic novel you will witness many of the convoluted events happening during the decade of the 80s in the Middle East, from the point of view of a brave girl that was living at the heart of the incidents. Marjane is able to present each topic that she wants to expose in titled parts where you learn about relevant facts of Iranian\u2019s society, its past, its present and its future. However, what makes unique Persepolis is the brilliant approach by Marjane Satrapi of those events, since while she is fearless to show the brutal side, she is also honest in showing her failures and doubts during growing up, and even she goes to the funny side of life. Since it\u2019s impossible for any human being to live in constant stressed status, people need to breath, to liberate the weight of their risky existence in many different ways. People needs to smile, not matter where they live. They need to live. And Marjane knows that. Therefore, she masterfully is able to tell her lifestory, full of political episodes and social chapters, but always adding humoristic elements with taste and without ridiculing the seriousness and gravity of the situations. Anybody can tell a tragedy but\u2026 \u2026a dramedy requires talent, tact and wit. Brace yourself and meet Persepolis . ...more \u0623\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0642\u0637 \u064a\u0633\u0642\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a

Way to feel dumb as shit in the (French) bookstore, I assure you. Things I know now : Marjane Satrapi , as a French-Iranian, can't enter the US now. But hey, it's for your \"security\" , all that shit.*** *** I just learned that French-Iranian had been authorized to go to the US with a Visa. Favorite quote from the whole collection : \"As time passed, I grew increasingly aware of the contrast between the official representation of my country and people's real lives, what happened behind doors\" (approximate translation by me, I don't own the English version to check) ... because we're at the core of what makes The Complete Persepolis so interesting and, I'll say it, indispensable. For me, the strength of Marjane Satrapi 's graphic-novel relies on the insight it offers the reader : where more classic nonfiction books can easily end up as mere juxtapositions of historical events (which is often boring, okay?), The Complete Persepolis successfully breaks the codes by combining Iran's History with Marjane Satrapi 's experience. I, for one, believe that we need this kind of insight just as much as history books, because as I said in my review of Rooftops of Tehran , it's way too easy to dehumanize people we know nothing about, to forget the much real people living in the countries that our leaders target. This is what I mean when I say that there's nothing political anymore in strongly disagreeing with Trump's decisions, especially when it comes to Muslims. At this point, it's not about agreeing on reducing taxes for the rich in order to avoid flight of capital, it's about acknowledging that everything in Western culture participates in feeding our prejudices. Really it's about acknowledging that these prejudices are real and that it's an everyday, conscious work to fight against them. What fighting prejudices does not mean : It doesn't mean agreeing with everything. It doesn't mean, oh my god, erasing western culture** - and that concept, loved and spread by so many of far right voters is so fucking ridiculous given the fact that we have controlled the narrative for so long, it's not even funny. The \"great replacement\" so dearly loved by FN voters is merely another way for them to express their islamophobia and show their lack of basic education. Forget me with this shit. ** I'm using \"western culture\" as a generalization here - I don't believe that all western countries share the *same* culture, far from it. What fighting prejudices means : it means accepting that different experiences are just as much valid. It means educating yourself, reading about and from people from different cultures. It means rejecting any attempt of categorizing cultures as being good or evil as a whole. It means a lot of listening and maybe less talking. Trust me, I very much include myself when I say that we have to educate ourselves. The truth is, I have a shit tons of biases. I'm desperately secular, hopelessly Cartesian and very much on the Left spectrum. I've beneficed from my white privilege my whole life. I'm a straight, abled woman from Europe. I will never understand religion - I am interested in religions, but it's not the same thing and it never will. As far as I'm concerned, though, people can believe what they want as long as they don't try to convince me that I should believe and live my life according to thus beliefs. And just to be clear, right now the intolerant people who are being vocals about condemning abortion or LGBTQIA rights in my country are very much Christians. Nobody asks you to change what you are , but to accept that others aren't the same. Am I going to screw up and fail to notice hurtful contents in the books I read? Probably, unfortunately. Yet I think that in the end, what baffles me and makes me so sad and so angry is the fact that so many people genuinely do not want to listen, learn and do better. Everything starts with education, and I'm not saying this because I'm a teacher. Nobody should ever forget that \"[we] know one thing; that [we] know nothing\".

I began by reading the Spanish edition of Le petit prince , which got me started nicely. Now I wanted to try something harder. I had in fact read Persepolis in French not long after it came out, but I remembered very little of it; this would be a proper test of whether I had actually learned anything. I was pleased to find that I could read it! I'm still having to guess Visiting Spain for a conference earlier this month, I impulsively decided to do something about my almost non-existent Spanish. I began by reading the Spanish edition of Le petit prince , which got me started nicely. Now I wanted to try something harder. I had in fact read Persepolis in French not long after it came out, but I remembered very little of it; this would be a proper test of whether I had actually learned anything. I was pleased to find that I could read it! I'm still having to guess a lot of words, and every now and then I found a sentence that made no sense at all, but I could follow the story without difficulties. The thing which surprised me most was that I found I liked the book better in Spanish than I had in French. After a while, I figured out why: my very uncertain language skills forced me to look carefully at all the pictures, and I realized that I hadn't properly appreciated them first time round. I'd read the book pretty much in one sitting, which didn't do it justice. This time, I gave the graphical aspects the attention they deserved. But dammit, forget the Spanish and the artwork: it's still the story that wins. Her horror and indignation over the dreadful Iranian republic are so powerfully expressed. There's one episode in particular that I can't get out of my head. She's been characteristically loudmouthed at school. The teachers call her parents, and they tell her very seriously that she must be more careful. Does she know what had happened to the teenage daughter of the man they knew who made false passports? Marji looks at them. Well, say her parents, they arrested her. And they sentenced her to death. But, according to Iranian law, one may not put a virgin to death. So she was forcibly married to one of the revolutionary guards, and he deflowered her. And then they could shoot her. But, again according to Iranian law, the groom must give the bride a dowry, and if she is dead he must give it to her parents. So the next day, a representative of the revolutionary guard called on them. And he gave them fifty tumanes - about five dollars. That was the price for her virginity and her life. I'm sorry, says Marji, stunned. I didn't know. The truly terrifying thing is that the tone, throughout most of the book, is one of amused irony. As she says in another very powerful passage, when she meets a friend who's been horribly mutilated after serving in the war with Iraq, you can only complain up to a certain point, when the pain is still bearable. After that it makes no sense any more. All you can do is laugh. ...more This was brilliant: a graphic novel depicting the coming-of-age of a young Iranian girl living in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, who is eventually sent to live in Austria for 4 years for her safety. It shows the horrors of living in a war-torn nation, as well as how terrifying it must be to live in a country run by religious fundamentalists/fanatics.

The Muslim leaders recruited 14 year old boys in the war effort, closed down schools, targeted intelligent people and women wearing jeans and nail polish... As a woman, the sexist views of the Islamists made me angry. One panel shows an Islamist on television saying \"Women's hair emanates rays that excite men. That's why women should cover their hair.\" If that isn't the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard :/ This was a very raw and candid portrayal of life. Satrapi didn't really try to sugarcoat anything. I liked the precocious child, Marji, who was trying to understand the world that was going on around her and wasn't scared of questioning the hypocrisies she witnessed. And her self-realization as she tried to determine her identity in Austria and when she went back to Iran and was perceived as an outsider and a worldly woman also held my attention. It made me think of people,especially children, living in other war-torn places such as Syria, what must they be going through everyday? What must they be witnessing? Torture, death etc? How can someone get over that? Definitely a must-read for everyone. Disclaimer: This book isn't anti-Islam, it's anti-fundamentalist. Satrapi mentioned how fundamentalists in every religion are dangerous, and I wholeheartedly agree. ...more 4.5/5 My first memories of Iraq and Iran consist of mixing the names up, having nothing more than the vague knowledge from television talkers that someone was fighting someone and we, the United States, were fighting everyone.

Persia was where my best friend in first grade was from, a place she once told me didn't exist anymore before she changed schools in third grade and we completely lost contact with each other. The intervening years between then and now filled up with reports of war and terrorism and an overwhelming fear mongering, leaving me with the feeling I was being force fed bullshit at such an insidious level that I couldn't even trust myself to seek out the least poisoned method of discovering the other side of the story. Since upgrading the status of literature in my life from hobby to livelihood, I've had more time to get down to the bottom of Introduction to Iran 101 - Autodidact Style entry on the neverending Lit bucket list, and I have to say, I can't imagine a better way than this book. Graphic novel, really, but with Watchmen on the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list and The Complete Maus regularly touted as a modern classic, the faster the academic niches of capital L Literature come to terms with the more than capable qualities of the Graphic Novel in terms of Meaning and Importance and yadda yadda yadda, the better. Three hundred years ago it was the novel in Europe, two millenia ago it was the writing things down in general in Greece,, and really, if you can find a memoir that is erudite as it is hilarious as it is heartbreaking as it is politically conscious in a social justice manner as it is life affirming as it is of a country that has for decades been horrendously misconstrued six ways to Sunday by the United States as this one, please, let me know. Member of the Guardians of the Revolution (MGR): Madam, why were you running? Marjane: I'm very late! I was running to catch my bus. MGR: Yes..but...when you run, your behind makes movements that are...how do you say...obscene! Marjane: WELL THEN DON'T LOOK AT MY ASS! I yelled so loudly that they didn't even arrest me. One of the first popular conceptions that comes to my mind when I think on Iran is how bad the women in that country have it. Now, the Wikipedia page for Rape culture states: According to Michael Parenti, rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as victim blaming, reluctance by the authorities to go against patriarchial cultural norms, as well as fears of stigmatization from rape victims and their families. That description is the United States, complete with dress codes, lack of sexual education regarding consent, incidents such as Steubenville and statistics such as 1 in 5 women in universities have been raped at some point during their enrollment. This commentary has nothing to do xenophobia of the civilized countries of the so called West, or with Iran consisting of all kinds of people worn down by death and fear and love of their homeland and culture being controlled by Persian fundamentalists, or the CIA's involvement in taking down countries so as to slake the US's lust for oil, or the fundamental differences between Iran and Iraq and Kuwait and all those other countries media crews love to lump together and poke at, but it does have to do with my basis for relating with Marjane and her growth from child to adult. In comparison to the big picture of her story, it's not much, but it is enough to get me off my commonly accepted high horse of US superiority and start listening. Marjane: 'I don't want to leave the country right away.' Reza: 'It's because you are still nostalgic. You'll see, a year from now people will disgust you. Always interfering in things that don't concern them.' Marjane: 'Maybe so, but in the West you can collapse in the street and no one will give you a hand.' It's a crying shame that it took me this long to read a work that wonderfully cuts to the heart of that vague sensationalism that is the US's treatment of the Middle East. It's an even greater shame that this sort of work is a rare breed in the field of public perception. However, while it may have taken me the length of my own path from childhood to adulthood to experience a good introduction to the reality of things, a start in the right direction is a start. ...more One of the things I loved about this book was Marjane's very individual voice and how it transformed from the start of the book when she is 10 to the end, when she is 22.

Ten-year-old Marjane, by the way, is about the most awesome kid I have encountered in print. She reminded me of Harper Lee's Scout, except Marjane was cuter and more hilarious. Also, more political. Most readers are unlikely to be really conversant in 20th Iranian political history and it is absolutely fascinating to be introduced to the topic through the eyes of an impressionable child, an emotional teenager and a jaded young adult. Marjane tells her story in an intense, honest, funny and heartbreaking fashion. The style of art is beautiful and everything is drawn in a kind of a kooky way. I though that the style reinforced that this whole story comes from one young person's distinct point of view. As in all graphic novels, the images are just as potent, if not more, than the plot itself and this is no exception. \"Persepolis\" is the best book I can think of to introduce the uninitiated to the world of graphic novels. The subject matter is the polar opposite of the superhero comic stereotype and the intense, skillful storytelling will captivate even the mots doubting reader. I adored it. ...more Ugh.

I never thought I'd be one to criticize profanity or being up-front, but I found that they made Marjane very unsavory. ...more I keep promising to write a full review for this but never get around to it.

A book about a major world event (The Islamic Revolution) Books such as this and The Complete Maus remind us how powerful the medium of \"comics\" is. It is not all Walt Disney and Tom and Jerry, folks. A question I heard a lot while I was reading this book was \"how does it compare with Maus ?\" -- and if I were to answer that question, I would say, I suppose, that I thought that Maus was more compelling, with more classically heroic characters, detailed, careful artwork (and-I-mean-come-ON it was about the holocaust , haven't we all agreed that's the official trump card?) -- but I'm not sure that it actually makes much sense to compare this book with Maus .

Sure, they're both graphic novels whose subject is generally similar. They're at once historical, tragic, and personal. But other than that, they're just two very different books, written by two very different authors regarding two different conflicts. It would be as if you were reading Red Badge of Courage , and people kept asking \"so, how does it compare with War and Peace ?\" Aaaaaannyway. So! About Persepolis . I went into this novel knowing essentially nothing about the war(s) in Iran, and to my surprise I left this book knowing essentially nothing about the war(s) in Iran. Just when the narrator reaches an age when she could really perceive what is happening in her country and act out against it or submit and meld into it, her parents wisely ship her off to Austria, and once there she specifically avoids watching the news and connecting with political developments back at home. Thus, for a large portion of the story we're led through her various musical tastes, hair styles and relationship developments (can you beliiieeeve that first boyfriend and the croissants?). There are no post scripts, tangents, or musical bridges conveying basic information to the reader, no \"meanwhile, back at the ranch, lots of people went to jail for silly things, and also there were deaths or something\". The narrator was divorced from these concerns at the time, and so are we the readers. Primarily, this novel is an autobiography: the details of her homeland function mostly to describe the main character, not the country or turmoil therein. Egotistical? It seemed that way, sometimes, but maybe it depends what you expected from the book. That said, Marjane Satrapi's character is a well-developed one: never the perfect angel, not always striving to even just be good, but continually just trying to figure things out and attain the same, elusive happiness everyone else seems to have. She's likable, interesting, self-deprecating and ever-changing, and for what it's worth I found it really difficult to put the book down. (To me, actually, that's worth quite a lot. I weep for a lost childhood in which I could never, ever seem to put a book down: I finished one and then desperately started another, consuming them like cocaine. Why aren't books like cocaine anymore? Maybe I should just give up on literature and try harder drugs. Or more graphical novels by Marjane Satrapi.) Thoroughly enjoyable, with artwork that really grew on me with time, and definitely recommended. Just don't expect to want to start a revolution afterwards. ...more Sem d\u00favida uma experi\u00eancia diferente da primeira leitura.

Graphic novel was the perfect medium for this story.

Here it is, I think that it is more appropriate that you hear from someone who knows more : Elham's review of The Complete Persepolis I think this is will be more response than review. Satrapi's Persepolis fulfills its purpose as a memoir, but I will tell you right from the start, that it is indeed overhyped, particularly if you have read the rave critical reviews.

Perhaps, since the field of graphic novels as memoirs is relatively new, a work like this could be called ground-breaking. Persepolis as a memoir is an interesting read. I say this only as a result of having read Part Two of this book, The Story of a Return . If I had read The Story of a Childhood alone, I probably would not have liked this book at all. As a memoir, her account of her childhood is biased politically. I'm speaking of Iranian politics and social affairs -even history- rather than any foreign policy. Satrapi would like to paint herself as an educated, superior specimen of progressive thought, but to be frank, one can embody all of her views in two words: westernism and nationalism. She worships \"punk\" and calls her family \"avant-garde.\" She considers herself the very spirit of Iranian society, the last bastion of reason in her country, but she goes to a French school and adopts Western, dress and idols. She does not seem very avant-garde to me. She seems to be the typical Eastern child who envies the Western one. I questioned at times whether she could truly be proud of her heritage-- or simply what she thought to be her heritage. I didn't see that adopting European principles or dress was any more or less admirable than adopting Arab ones. Even when she reads, she reads only foreign philosophers. Her patriotism seems a shell. This is precisely why I was skeptical-- because any book praised by a mass of American critics generally affirms American values, American superiority (the rest of the world is backwards) and/or American-approved values. Such a work will generally portray a one-sided view of the culture in question, i.e. the approved view, as this one does. In fact, I'm finding there is a slew of Iranian authors jumping on the bandwagon of vilifying Iran (to an all too receptive audience) and glorifying everything Western. In the introduction, she writes \"...this old and great civilization,\" and I have to wonder which civilization she means since she laments that so much culture has been imposed on Iranians. What is essentially Iranian? Zoroastrianism? She doesn't strike me as Zoroastrian. Satrapi fails to consider the dynamics and nature of culture, to adopt, borrow, and grow. That is progress. Satrapi writes of Iran, it \"...has been discussed mostly in connection with fundamentalism, fanaticism, and terrorism. As an Iranian who has lived more than half my life in Iran, I know that this image is far from the truth.\" In fact, Satrapi does nothing to negate this view. She simply replaces it with a new paradigm, all religious Iranians are fanatics. The rest adopt Western customs; they're civilized. This is not debunking misperceptions, it's only espousing the latest Western policy: non-religious Easterners are acceptable. She does nothing to help her people here. The book speaks only in the briefest way (a line or two) about American relations, so do not be concerned about any bias in that regard. So if we call the first part Politics, the second part -the book is really not complete without it- is more honest. In The Story of a Return , she speaks of her experiences as an immigrant in Europe, and these strike me as less politicized and more genuine. As for her return, we know that Satrapi returned only to say goodbye. She is an expatriate in Paris, living the culture that she so worshiped as a child. That said, as a memoir, this book is pretty interesting and does indeed describe the forces that shaped this woman. The iconic, stylized, almost childlike art cushions the narrative, so that the political content is less threatening. It's cute. And it suits the tone of the book, which is fanciful and ostensibly a protest against a black and white world (though Satrapi is a little rigid herself). It's worth a read if you have some spare time. It was better than I expected after reading the first half, but it won't be on my Best Of list anytime soon. ...more 4.5 stars - Spoilers -Brilliant, this was so much more than what I expected.

It was simple yet powerful. -Marji's struggles in Iran were portrayed so well, I believed everything I was reading. One of the main issues I have with fact based or autobiographical novels is that I always feel things are exaggerated, hidden or changed so that the story can seem more glamorous or thought provoking or profound. In Persepolis I never felt that way once, I was swept away in the story, and it felt like I was there watching and experiencing all the good and bad in Marji's life \u2014 it was brutal and honest storytelling. -Marji was mostly a horrid character. She was self centered, angry, jealous and self pitying, yet she still made for an engaging and interesting character. I was really put off with her getting an innocent man in trouble (probably getting whipped or beaten) just so she could protect herself. I wouldn't have minded her doing that if 1. It was certain she'd even get in trouble in the first place or 2. If the guy had been guilty for some other crime. It was unforgivable what she did, and it actually made for uncomfortable reading\u2026 Especially when she laughed about it and felt no remorse. I have to say that there were parts where I loved Marji, like when she was being rebellious towards unreasonable authority figures. There were a lot of times where her strict teachers or elders would tell her off or threaten her for wearing certain clothes/make up, listening to music, talking to guys, etc. And I loved that Marji stuck up for herself\u2026 I cheered when some Guardians of the Revolution told Marji not to run for the bus because the movements were obscene (and would tempt some poor guy into wanting sex), and she basically told them to fuck off, and to not stare at her arse if it turned them on so much. -What I thought was done really well was Marji's depression and loneliness in the years she spent alone in a foreign country. Her parents sent her to school in Vienna so she'd be away from the war between Iraq/Iran, they wanted her to be safe and happy but she ended up being lonely, misunderstood, used and abused. I really felt for her, she had loving parents but because she was on her own, she felt unloved and unimportant. -I was a bit confused about whether Marji was a muslim or not. She drank, dated, had sex and did drugs\u2026 She never prayed or read the Koran\u2026 Although she did have conversations with God. I just never got the sense that she was a muslim \u2014 maybe it was because her parents weren't religious? -I liked the illustrations, they were clear and easy to follow\u2026 But they didn't blow me away\u2026 That's one of the main reason that I gave this 4.5 stars instead of 5. I was really impressed with Persepolis \u2014 especially how it showed the human and forward thinking side of Iran, and also the repressive and fanatical side. I feel that western media doesn't show nearly enough coverage of the majority non-extremist and very much human side of muslim countries \u2014 there should be more of it shown, it'd be one way to help relations between everyone. ...more Okay, I have finally finished this magnificent book and I am really really really glad that I chose this to read.

There is a line- \u201cWar always takes you by surprise.\u201d Yeah, true. For a girl of twelve, religious rebellions are nothing but a surprise, a shock. But Marjane was undoubtedly valiant and so were her parents. When everyone was busy to hide under the veil, her parents taught her to be bold, to be brave. I liked her courageous approach of showing the whole world what she had to experience, without tampering anything. She told about every miserable episode of her life. How pathetic her life became on those war days, how she and her parents endured the pain of losing the dear ones, how she ended up in Austria, how people insulted her because of her appearance, how desperately she wanted to remove the image of an Iranian girl, how she got along with the anarchist, how she wanted to kill herself, everything is written with honesty.

And then there's also the #ownvoices factor for those who are interested. This is a very personal story, one in which the author is not afraid to talk about things that are tough or even things she did wrong in her past. For a westerner, it's worth it to read this just for the sake of learning about a culture that the west really does look down on. And while we might have more or less the right understanding politically, culturally we are pretty much blind. Also, all of it is presented in a lighthearted way, even though it is all tough stuff like war and loss. I do agree though that reading was sometimes hard because of all the politics, especially at first, but the author does present it in a very friendly and understandable way. It's approachable. I don't know how much of that I'll retain, but I'm sure I'll come away with something more than I started with (......basically, zero). Anyway, I don't know how much I succeeded in making this short, but hey. Moral of the story: this is definitely worth your time.

It's an honest account of a young girl coming of age in Iran beginning in the early 1980's and advancing into the 1990's when the author left her country to make a life outside it. It's an insider's look at what many people might have certain preconceived ideas about when it comes to Iran and its culture, having only seen things previously from the outside. I was grateful for the opportunity to learn more and have a quick history lesson of Iran told in simple terms, though it is far from a simple subject. And I was glad to learn why certain customs and practices came to be in that region, many of them forced upon the people living there. Reading this book certainly gave me an appreciation of the freedoms I enjoy and made me wishful that others could preserve their cultures and not at the cost of their own freedom. This book also showed what it was like living in a war zone with danger coming not only from the outside but from within, with the enormous pressure from all sides closing in on the people living there. This is a serious novel suitable for people ages 16 and up in which, surprisingly, the author deftly included humorous elements, keeping it from being dry or overly depressing. But it never lost its urgency or the message the author wished to convey which she stated at the beginning of the book: \"I believe an entire nation should not be judged by the wrongdoings of a few extremists. I also don't want those Iranians who lost their lives in prisons defending freedom, who died in the war against Iraq, who suffered under various repressive regimes, or who were forced to leave their families and flee their homeland to be forgotten. One can forgive but one should never forget.\" The author achieved her goal by making this story personal, something that anyone can identify with no matter where they live, about the challenges of growing up, while telling a broader story of remembrance that informed. The remarkable illustrations helped, showing action and emotion through a mix of refined drawings and more basic images: http://blindmanwithapistol.files.word... http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/photo... http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/...

It is the story of the author's youth, growing up in revolutionary Iran before moving to Austria at 14, and then later returning to Iran before escaping again, this time to France, where she still lives. Her story is both familiar and alien - a story of being a child enjoying her childhood during the revolution of '79, and how it impacted on her life; learning about the history of her country, the religious hypocrisy, the regime; being a teenager in the 80s in Europe, delving into pot and nihilism, trying to find a place in the world but never really fitting in. The story is often funny, and the method of telling it in comic-strip style suits it perfectly. There's not a wasted panel, and the illustrations add layers to the dialogue and exposition captions. While it's also a very controlling method - in that, because graphics are supplied, you're not really able to imagine it freely on your own - there's so much in the details, and so much feeling in the illustrations, that I'm reminded of that saying, \"a picture speaks a thousand words\". It was fascinating to learn about what Iran's been through from someone who's lived through it - I used to read a lot of those books written by women in Iran and Saudi Arabia, but they lacked a broader scope of understanding, and exposure to foreign political ideology and perspective. Satrapi read a lot of philosophers etc., and while some of her youthful ideologies are captured with a degree of irony, she still had a clear understanding of the situation - aided by her free-thinking parents and her wonderful grandmother. While I had trouble in the beginning keeping up with the history of Iran's political leaders, which I found confusing, the story is easy to follow and is a great way to introduce people to the reality of Iran - up to the mid-1990s anyway. The hypocrisies, contrasts, day-to-day living, life-style, dreams and ambitions are all rendered in clear, distinctive black-and-white illustrations and laced with irony. There were many moments were I laughed myself silly, and other moments that were poignant and sad, but always, always, Satrapi is brutally honest with herself and her readers. Highly recommended. ...more It's touching, brutal, strange, foreign and very real.

Sometimes it just screams, \"Why don't you listen to me?\" Take a look at some arab countries and you'll know what I mean.. religion is forced on the people, and some ignorant people supporting or lets say worshiping some regimes or presidents that are not great but just because it hates islamic system or it hates seculars -------- Hijab One of the major things the new regime forced on the people is the veil(hijab), or thats what you will feel like because the main character Marjane is female. I hated the new regime and sometimes I asked my self why we wear Hijab and don't drink wine, etc.. but then I answered my self, Hijab is sign of a free women (Omar ibn alKhattab said that only the free women are allowed to wear Hijab), you may ask your self how?? just see this video(the daily show): Dalia Mogahed with trevor noah and please(females) don't deny it.. its easy to get what you want by using your body than using your brain or character! and thats exactly why Islam said you must wear Hijab(or at least that what I think), God didn't create you to be put in a vitrina, or to be in every commercial just to increase the sales, its your brain that matters! the regime in Iran that time is not different from France these days, when 4 police men orderd a women who was wearing burkini to undress .. while criticizing ISIS that ordered women to wear Niqab ------ Nationality our main character will suffer alot, specially when she will travel to Austria, to live her life in an unoppressed environment, but there is a cost.. her identity. she'll try to be like the others to blind in, and sometimes she'll tell the others that she is not Iranian, either be saying or by her attitudes and her style! forgetting the only advice her gandmother gave to her: Always keep your dignity and be true to yourself. ...more I remember renting a copy of the film adaptation of this graphic novel back in 2005, and really enjoying it.

So it makes sense that only a handful were truly allowed close to the girl, and therefore me as a reader. That's how I've interpretated it anyway! Marjane's love/hate relationship with Iran is palpable. Her struggles outside the country could have been a lot worse, and current affairs came to mind strongly during those scenes. I think for that reason this story will continue to be relevant and powerful for many years to come. Finally, I definitely think graphic novel was the right medium choice for this story, it helped to connect with the characters, even though the black and white drawings are simple - it definitely helped me to keep up with the story and timeline, and added an element of innocence and detachment from the more horrifying scenes that can only come from a storyteller who has grown up in that world. I also think that some of the more historical and political parts could have gone over my head without those accompanying images. Overall I very much enjoyed it, and I think I I'll continue to think about it for a few days. ...more<---C>Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h</---C>", "Title": "The Complete Persepolis"},
