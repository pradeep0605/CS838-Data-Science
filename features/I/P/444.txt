It\u2019s just the sort of book I should have given 5 stars: my MA is in Victorian Lit., Charles Dickens is a favorite author, and I adore historical fiction, particularly Victorian pastiche: Possession , The Crimson Petal and the White and English Passengers . And yet The Luminaries didn\u2019t grab me. It has all the elements of a pitch-perfect Dickensian mystery novel: long-lost siblings, forgeries, opium dens, misplaced riches, a hidden cache of letters, illegitimate offspring, assumed identities, a s\u00e9ance, a witty and philosophical omniscient narrator\u2019s voice, and so on. If this was a Victorian paint-by-numbers competition, Catton would have top marks.<---F> But something is lacking here</---F>. I can\u2019t help feeling that despite its technical perfection, The Luminaries is a book without a beating heart. Lest I seem unfair, here are some more of the novel\u2019s strengths: Catton proves a dab hand at revealing characters through both minute physical description and acute psychological insight. She\u2019s especially good at examining interiority vs. exteriority (one of my favorite lines was \u201che built his persona as a shield around his person\u201d), and the ways stories are altered in subsequent retellings. Her use of contemporary slang, circumlocutions (\u201cd\u2014ned\u201d), chapter introductions (\u201cIn which\u2026\u201d), and a host of overarching fairy tales and ideologies, including the angel-whore dichotomy of nineteenth-century womanhood and the witch vs. the babes in the wood (brothel-keeping fortuneteller Lydia Wells against Anna Wetherell and Emery Staines), is all spot-on. Staines, in particular, is a brilliant creation: a thoroughly amiable, guileless na\u00eff to rival any of Dickens\u2019s fresh-faced heroes. And, indeed, the echoes of Dracula , Moby-Dick and the very best of Dickens \u2013 Our Mutual Friend especially, but also Bleak House and Great Expectations \u2013 are well-earned. If I had to list a few minor quibbles, I\u2019d mention that some of the more fascinating characters fade into the background as the novel progresses, rendering the original council of 13 largely irrelevant: brooding Walter Moody would have made for a great everyman protagonist, and Tom Balfour promised to be a delightfully tenacious detective like Dickens\u2019s Inspector Bucket. Moreover, especially in the first half, Catton is over-reliant on the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate as a means of advancing the plot; it is easy to grow weary of the tedious string of one-to-one meetings. My main problem, however, is with the opacity of the astrology angle. The novel\u2019s supposed uniqueness lies in this astrological framing device, but I remain unconvinced. The esoteric material (including horoscope charts at the start of each Part, chapter titles that reference zodiac signs, and lunar cycles that bring the narrative back around to meet its starting point) adds little, if anything, to the plot. Readers don\u2019t need overt references to the Age of Pisces to spot themes of twinship and hiddenness \u2013 the clues are there already. Furthermore, Catton\u2019s commitment to portraying a full year\u2019s astrological changes requires looping back to revisit the events of 1865-6 for almost the full last quarter of the novel (thus, also, the unsubtle metaphor of the ouroboros \u2013 the ancient symbol of a snake biting its own tail \u2013 and the translation of the town name \u201cHokitika\u201d as something like \u201cfull-circle\u201d). I do now understand how sly that cyclical technique is (it also ties in with the cover image of the waning moon); thank you to Elizabeth Knox, Catton\u2019s fellow New Zealander novelist, for explaining that each successive Part is half the length of its predecessor \u2013 such that before long the chapter introductions are longer than the text they preface: commentary exceeds action. While I certainly recognize the skill that such a formal stricture displays, once again this is proof to me of academic accomplishment rather than novelistic vitality. In this respect, the novel appears too clever for its own good. It\u2019s a somewhat dispiriting experience for the reader to feel the plot winding down around page 600, only to realize that another 230+ pages remain. I will make a defiant claim here: I hold that the novel should have ended on page 628 (for those with page numbers different to my ARC, that\u2019s after the first chapter of Part Four). Apart from a first-rate courtroom scene, you won\u2019t miss much after that point. You will already have unravelled all the vagaries of the plot by then, and you can end on the sweet note of Anna and Staines arriving in New Zealand, ready to face the myriad adventures that await them in the previous 627 pages. If not there, page 622 would do (the end of Part Three), or perhaps page 717 (the end of Part Four). But, alas, it\u2019s as if Catton just doesn\u2019t know when to put the book to rest. In scope and seriousness, The Luminaries rivals almost any Victorian triple-decker \u2013 an impressive feat from a 28-year-old author, there\u2019s no denying that. (Am I jealous at the scale of her accomplishment, given that she\u2019s two years my junior? Perhaps, a touch. Still, I feel I\u2019ve been fair here.) I love door-stopper novels \u2013 when every page is necessary. But when, as is the case here, nearly a quarter of the page count feels superfluous, there\u2019s something ever so slightly off. I wish I could have deemed The Luminaries a five-star book. It\u2019s a rollicking, meticulously plotted mystery, as well as an enjoyable read. Plus it\u2019s always nice to see something a bit different on the Booker longlist. It deserves its accolades thus far and I do hope it makes the shortlist, but did I love it? No; I admired it, but it didn\u2019t earn my affection. Ergo, three stars. ...more I am ashamed. I am a foolish reader who, like many, take on a booker short-list, or a booker winner, and expect it to wow me. And it did, and it didn't. I have an unsophisticated mind. To any reader who reads books as an art critic views a great master, they will read and hear the subtleties of the writer's mind as they structure their work, layer upon layer, until a masterpiece is drawn. They will see and know the influences that formed the concept and guided the writer's pen in its construction. I am ashamed.

And reading <---A>Eleanor Catton</---A>'s masterful use of the English language, and her homage to the Victorian masters of literature, I was greatly humbled, and completly understood why she was shortlisted. She is a sublime writer. For a 'proper' review I would urge you to read Antinomasia's review on GR. No review have I read sofar is so discerning and informed. If I had read this before I bought and invested so much time reading a book too long for this reader to enjoy, I would never have bought it in the first place. It is a book for the discerning reader, and not the 'pop' reader, who likes his fiction to the point, entertaining, engrossing, informative, and exercising (to a degree)... well I'm an easy read... I am a lazy reader, prolific, but utimately shallow. Present me with too many concepts and inventions in a book then I grow impatient. Join too many 'exercises' in the writer's craft together, and I become frustated. Strip away the artists concept, and if I do not have a picture that I can glimpse and enjoy for all its colour and story then all I see is a few squirls of paint, thoughtfully applied, but ultimately a poor picture to fill a mind with interest. The Luminaries is an average story. It is like so many winners of the Tate Prize in art. How many winners would you really want to grace your shelves, tabletops and alcoves? And at 800+ pages the Luminairies is an 'instalation' and not a piece of work to sit upon a humble shelf, alongside my Cornwell, Austin and Dickens, Rupert Bear Albums, Tin Tin and Ant & Dec (Oh what a lovely pair!) My shelves no longer have room for such large tomes. What can I remove to the charity shop. Ant & Dec perhaps! So I found The Luminairies a master writer's/crtitic's wet dream, but as a story... well sentence by sentence it is beautifully crafted, but the shear number of them in relation to one scene, or description (particulary at the the beginning) wore me down. Characters were so many, their voices seem to merge into the same sound. They began to form a crowd in my mind, all speaking the same voice, their personalties indiscernible. The astrology was lost on me. The Luminaries is indeed a worthy Booker winner. It is art in writing. But for a reader who takes Alister McClean to the beach, Jeffrey Archer to bed, and lies on the summer grass filling his head with Asimov... I was never the reader for this book. ...more I'm abandoning this book, with regret for having read it against my better judgement, without more thorough research. And yes, I'm two-starring and reviewing an unfinished book. If that offends you to your very core, then stop reading now. You've been warned! 1. There's a trend among reviews of three stars or less on this book to say things like: I\u2019ll simply attempt to explain why I gave such an accomplished book only 3 stars. It\u2019s just the sort of book I should have given 5 stars.... I am ashame I'm abandoning this book, with regret for having read it against my better judgement, without more thorough research.

And it did, and it didn't. I have an unsophisticated mind. Everyone here is raving about this book including people who write great novels themselves. I'm feeling pretty miserable about the fact that I couldn't get into it, forced myself to read halfway, started again and then gave up in despair. The Luminaries is a very long mystery novel which did not enlighten or move me. I am probably not a good judge.... I find these kinds of comments sad, but telling. Buck up, goodreaders who don't much like The Luminaries ! There's enough conspiring against us to make us feel stupid; we don't need books to do that. 2. I'm way over feeling like it's some flaw in me when I don't like a book that almost everyone else likes. It's not me, book, it's you. I'm just not that into you. We haven't spent that much time together (then again, I've read more pages of you than are in the average contemporary novel), but I know you well enough to know this isn't going to work out. So farewell, best of luck, and I know you're going to find a whole heap o' love out there, coz' you're a real looker, you Man Booker. 3. Man Booker. FFS. 4. This book has two fatal flaws for me: 1) fussy structure over character; 2) metaphor gone wild. 5. Although it's not really metaphor gone wild; more like metaphor that is so subtle as to be irrelevant to most readers...unless they know astrology well enough that they can pick up what she's doing using astrological concepts to illuminate character behaviour/plot. I certainly do not, and did not. 6. I think astrology is fun, but dumb (here, in both senses). 7. On structure, I know it's there because I've been told so. But all I felt while reading, certainly in the first 300 pages, was: why is this language so expositional and why are these actions so overblown? Why do all these irrelevant details matter? 8. They don't. And neither do the characters, although each one is really intriguing. I would have liked them to be central to the plot, and for the plot to be ascendant over structure. I guess it wasn't in the stars. 9. Also, setting: New Zealand, 1860, during a gold rush and early settlement. I was so looking forward to being immersed in it; alas, I got absolutely no feeling for it. Biggest disappointment, by far. 10. The final blow comes from a GR review citing The Guardian's review : \"It's not about story at all. It's about what happens to us when we read novels \u2013 what we think we want from them \u2013 and from novels of this size, in particular. Is it worthwhile to spend so much time with a story that in the end isn't invested in its characters?\" 11. No. 12. I'm increasingly factoring opportunity costs into the arithmetic I do to determine when/if to abandon a book. In other words, I could've been reading Shirley . Or Anna Karenina . So, 12 reflections on The Luminaries. Heh. See what I did there? ...more \u0627\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \"832 \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629\" \u062a\u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u062c\u0627\u0626\u0632\u0629

This is Twelve men meet at the Crown Hotel in Hokitika, New Zealand, in January, 1866. A thirteenth, Walter Moody, an educated man from Edinburgh who has come here to find his fortune in gold, walks in. As it unfolds, the interlocking stories and shifting narrative perspectives of the twelve--now thirteen--men bring forth a mystery that all are trying to solve, including Walter Moody, who has just gotten off the Godspeed ship with secrets of his own that intertwine with the other men's concerns. This is not an important book. There is no magnificent theme, no moral thicket, no people to emancipate, no countries to defend, no subtext to unravel, and no sizable payoff. Its weightiness is physical, coming in at 832 pages. And yet, it is one of the most marvelous and poised books that I have read. Although I didn't care for the meandering rambling books of Wilkie Collins, I am reminded here of his style, but Catton is so much more controlled, and possesses the modern day perspective in which to peer back. I felt a warmth and a shiver at each passing chapter, set during the last days of the New Zealand gold rush. Catton hooked me in in this Victorian tale of a piratical captain; a Maori gemstone hunter; Chinese diggers (or \"hatters\"); the search for \"colour\" (gold); a cache of hidden gold; s\u00e9ances; opium; fraud; ruthless betrayal; infidelity; a politician; a prostitute; a Jewish newspaperman; a gaoler; shipping news; shady finance; a ghostly presence; a missing man; a dead man; and a spirited romance. And there's more between Dunedin and Hokitika to titillate the adventurous reader. Primarily, THE LUMINARIES is an action-adventure, sprawling detective story, superbly plotted, where the Crown Hotel men try to solve it, while sharing secrets and shame of their own. There's even a keen courtroom segment later in the story. And, there are crucial characters that are not gathered in the Crown that night who link everyone together. The prostitute and opium addict, Anna Wetherell, is nigh the center of this story, as she is coveted or loved or desired by all the townspeople. The layout of the book is stellar: the spheres of the skies and its astrological charts. You don't need to understand the principles and mathematics of astrology (I don't), but it is evident that knowledge of this pseudoscience would add texture to the reading experience, as it provides the structure and frame of the book. The characters' traits can be found in their individual sun signs (such as the duality of a Germini). The drawings of charts add to the mood, and the chapters get successively shorter after the long Crown chapter. The cover of the book illustrates the phases of the moon, from full moon to sliver, alluding to the waning narrative lengths as the story progresses. \"But onward also rolls the outer sphere--the boundless present, which contains the bounded past.\" Take note of the cast list at the beginning, which is quite helpful for the initial 200 or 300 pages. With so many vivid characters coming at you at once, it is difficult at first to absorb. However, as the pages sail (and they will, if this appeals to you), you won't even need the names and professions. The story and its striking, almost theatrical players become gradually and permanently installed, thoroughly and unforgettably. From the scar on Captain Francis Carver's cheek, to the widow's garment on Anna Wetherell's gaunt frame, the lively images and descriptions animate this boisterous, vibrant story. Catton is a master storyteller; she combines this exacting 19th century style and narrator--and the \"we\" that embraces the reader inside the tale--with the faintest sly wink of contemporary perspective. Instead of the authorial voice sounding campy, stilted, and antiquated, there is a fresh whiff of nuanced canniness, a knowing Catton who uncorks the delectable Victorian past by looking at it from the postmodern future. You will either be intoxicated by this big brawl of a book, or weighed down in its heft. If you are looking for something more than it is, then look no further than the art of reading. There's no mystery to the men; Catton lays out their morals, scruples, weaknesses, and strengths at the outset. The women had a little poetic mystery to them, but in all, these were familiar players--she drew up stock 19th century characters, but livened them up, so that they leaped madly from the pages. There isn't much to interrogate except your own anticipation. If you've read COLOUR, by Rose Tremain, don't expect any similarities except the time, place, setting, and the sweat and grime of the diggers. Otherwise, the two books are alike as fish and feathers. The stars shine bright as torches, or are veiled behind a mist, like the townspeople and story that behave under the various constellations. Catton's impeccably plotted yarn invites us to dwell in this time and place. At times, I felt I mined the grand nuggets of the story, and at other times, it blew away like dust. \"But there is no truth except truth in relation, and heavenly relation is composed of wheels in motion, tilting axes, turning dials; it is a clockwork orchestration that alters every minute, never repeating never still...We now look outward...we see the world as we wish to perfect it, and we imagine dwelling there.\" ...more [4.5] A rip-roaring yarn and awe-inspiring use of experimental form - it's not every day you see that in a book.

Like Catton's previous near-masterpiece, The Rehearsal , this suffers from a rather misleading cover. The illustration, and the very title The Luminaries seem to allude to \"a different world entirely... a world of drawing rooms, and calling cards, and gowns\" (p.31) - not a mystery/ adventure involving gold prospectors, prostitutes, drug addiction and frontier-town bigwigs. One likely to appeal to quite a number of readers who may be put off by the first impression of yet another Austen/Dickens pastiche. The Luminaries certainly is a pastiche of a kind, though it was never so overwhelmingly Victorian in its style as I expected after seeing a well-known book blogger mention how he abandoned it: \"Jeanette Winterson said, \"If you want to read 19th-century novels, you may as well read the real thing, and not go out and buy a reproduction.\" It strays further from faithful Victorian reproduction after the early chapters, still making wonderful use of the depth of characterisation that's too often missing from contemporary British novels. And it's certainly faster reading than most nineteenth-century originals. The narrative voice has hints of George Eliot (whom I was delighted to read Catton also prefers over the Brontes and Austen). But (perhaps because I've never read Wilkie Collins, with whom this book's most often been compared so far) the experience of reading The Luminaries made me think most of all of Arthur Conan Doyle, back before I'd read the Holmes stories so often they'd become a little boring. Tales of skullduggery and crime often recounted through the medium of conversations between men - sometimes in the telling itself, sometimes as a deep-sea dive into a framed narrative like Heart of Darkness . Still, those were comparisons to the actual Victorian... Neo-Victorian isn't a trend in which I've had much interest other than the odd work by big names like A.S. Byatt, Sarah Waters and Alan Moore. The larger-than life characters and the sheer pointless fun of this story do, for me, recall comics put into prose. (Michael Chabon was perhaps the most unlikely comparison I kept making as I read.) Catton seems like an intellect every bit as formidable as Byers but she so far has applied it to structure rather than essentially highbrow story-topics. Unlike Waters (and many other historical novelists) her application of modern values is subtle; characters are people of their time, though perhaps a greater percentage of the well-off white men are, without fanfare, decent and civil to ethnic minorities and to women of questionable backgrounds than may have been the case in the real mid nineteenth century. Characters of all origins are treated with equal dignity by the narrative, again, without ever making a song and dance about it, which periodically gives a rather pleasant time-warp effect. The setting, at least for most non-ANZ readers, has much novelty and interest, when so much Victoriana focuses on London; plus it has similarities to the Wild West along with its own distinctive character. It's often quite possible to imagine if only one could put the words together a bit more nicely, had greater stamina for writing at length &c, how it might have been possible to write various books. The Luminaries though, is from a writing perspective a fairly mind-boggling achievement that sounds almost as difficult,and almost as much a potential impediment to producing a good story, as do the letter-missing-out antics of Georges Perec. 1) It is a highly complex mystery which would in itself be a considerable invention. 2) Each of its 12 parts has a word count exactly half that of its predecessor. 3) Astrology, a pre-existing complex (fictional) system has been used as a starting point for the characters' interactions. (A three-stairs-in-one-stride step up in intricacy from the use of playing cards in The Rehearsal. ) Not only that but Catton has partially refashioned astrology to her own purpose by making each of the main characters a sign or a planet, and various buildings the houses on the chart - such that, for example, Mercury in Aries means a meeting of those two characters. (I think it would also be perfectly possible to enjoy the book as a story whilst ignoring or knowing little of these aspects.) Towards the end of the book, it's possible to see the decreasing word-count become slightly burdensome as the \"in which\" chapter descriptions start to near the length of the text they precede. These same length constraints mean that there are several short chapters going into detail about earlier events to a level that isn't always necessary, but which I nearly always found interesting. At least Catton doesn't use this tailing-off to tie the \"present\" fates of the characters up too neatly. I (and probably a lot of readers of a book like this) prefer some unknowns at the end - although it's not terribly Victorian. What is impressive, though, is that the content never seems forced or unnatural - only the layout and chapter divisions indicate something unusual is going on. The astrological-themed characters are an object lesson in how a seriously good writer can make archetypes into interesting personalities, few of whom end up seeming like stock characters; there's something atypical or unexpected about nearly all of them which offsets their origins. (Sometimes it's easy to spot how it's done: e.g. a spendthrift dandy ... who's Scandinavian.) Most have a cartoonish yet complex quality which reminds me of good comics. I didn't find out that twelve of the characters were based on star-sign attributes (though the planetary ones were clearer, somehow from the oblique dramatis personae ) until I'd read over 200 pages. Once I knew this it all fell into place \u2013 and I occasionally had to banish mental pictures of the early 90's Creme Egg ads when certain characters appeared \u2013 but given that a) I know far more than I'd like about astrology and b) I think I read quite closely I was all the more impressed with Catton's characterisation for not having been able to help making it ridiculously obvious as many authors would have. A drawback of the astrological scheme is that the planet-in-sign chaptering led to rather a lot of one-on-one conversations. What they characters are saying is generally exciting, and sometimes the chats become a framing device, but the format led to a slight background monotony that was at odds with my otherwise great enjoyment of the book. (This is why it's a rounded-down, not rounded-up 4.5.) The quieter among these conversations, in which we witness characters' communication of information - some of which we may already know - and their reactions, and in which \u201ctelling not showing\u201d is really part of the useful action, reminded me of 18th-19th century epistolary novels. Whilst sceptics surely can't argue with the idea of using one made-up system to make up something else, I've noticed a few press reviews which are puzzled by the astrological basis of the novel when only one character, Lydia Wells, has any enthusiasm for star signs. To me it seemed another mental leap by the author; to use this scheme for a story with a cast of hippies, psychics etc would have been obvious. Instead the story in The Luminaries is seasoned with astrology but not, I would say, overwhelmed by it \u2013 similar to the way Celine & Julie Go Boating is seasoned with magic both stage and esoteric. Though perhaps it's only if one's had much familiarity with astrology that it doesn't seem off-key to see it applied to non-adherents, to things and people which seem unrelated to the subject. Everyone has a horoscope, whether they've ever taken any notice of it or not. Even Richard Dawkins. My own knowledge comes from OCD-like phases of struggle with superstitious systems plus a tendency to hoover up information. (I managed to break from astrology after discovering \u201cfixed star\u201d astrology which added a near-exponential number of extra possibilities so that, crucially, from within the system itself and not only from outside, it all started to seem nonsensical and as if it could be made to say anything.) I was a little disappointed that, according to this interview Eleanor Catton seems \u2013 for the moment - to embrace astrology unquestioningly although she must be enormously intelligent. But she has at least made a rather stupendous work of art out of it - one started when she would have been only 26. This is, incidentally, the first novel of its size I've finished in exactly six years. The last one was Darkmans - pure coincidence that the names almost mirror. And like the Nicola Barker, it was so enjoyable that the book was rarely burdensome (even if I did take a day off in the middle for a sub-300 pager, which helped). I would love to see The Luminaries win the Booker. (There are two or three contenders between which I can hardly choose.) Though its scale of ambition and experiment, and sheer bulk, lead inevitably to a few imperfections that wouldn't be found in a more conventionally-structured, polished novel of a quarter of its length. Regardless, it was enormous fun, very readable and ever so clever. ...more 5 \"superlative, intricate and fascinating\" stars 4th Favorite Read of 2015 Wow just wow.

This book reminded me of a complex mandala ....broad at the outside and like a whirlpool draws you in quicker and quicker so that you are immersed in a world that you never want to leave. This novel is systematic, mystical and endlessly fascinating. She uses astrological charts and also personality traits to predict the futures of her fifteen or so main characters.

Fearsome, single-minded Aries! This book does not fall under the sign of Aries; it is invested in the past, it is enchanted by it. The past is such an important part of the novel that the narrative continues after its climactic resolution with a series of escalating chapters that take the reader back to where it all began. The Luminaries' characters live under the shadow of their own pasts, they judge others by their past actions as well. Aries is well-represented by Te Rau Tauwhare, a Maori greenstone hunter. Taurus the Bull is a sign of love, in all of its strength and awkwardness, its earthiness and purity. Obstinate, strong-willed Taurus! This book has a strong Taurean influence: it has at its heart a passionate and moving story of star-crossed lovers, determined to persevere, blind to reason - two parts of a whole that yearn to merge. Taurus is represented - poorly - by the aloof banker Charlie Frost. Gemini the Twins , sharp and cutting, a sign of the mind, of the air. Impulsive and restless Gemini! This book has a marked Gemini influence in its clever narrative voice, one often sidelined by description and dialogue yet still distinct, full of wit and sly innuendo. Gemini's influence is even stronger when considering the almost dizzying ingenuity of the book's look-at-me structure and its increasingly cheeky chapter introductions. Gemini is represented by Benjamin Lowenthal, a Jewish newspaper editor and a character in need of richer development. Cancer the Crab moons about in its shell, moody and self-absorbed, yet caring and loyal to the end. Complicated, sensitive Cancer! The Crab has little to do with The Luminaries, except when looking at novel in general terms. A strong and thick hardcover book, a complicated structure, a soft heart lurking within. Cancer is well-represented by the hotelier Edgar Clinch. Leo the Lion sits back, the very image of self-satisfaction, a magnet to lesser men, a sun that would have the whole universe revolve around it. Confident and surprisingly generous Leo! The heavy-lidded sensuality of the Lion holds court throughout The Luminaries, its beautiful imagery and its rich descriptive prowess openly displayed; well-hung Leo also clearly influenced this book's impressive length. Leo is represented by Dick (lol) Mannering, a goldfields magnate. Virgo the Virgin is the sign of this reviewer. It is the most wonderful sign imaginable: critical yet fair, judgmental but only in the most loving of ways, altruistic, well-read, self-sacrificing, practically perfect in every way, the Mary Poppins of the Zodiac. All must bow to the wonder of Virgo! The Virgin is terribly represented by Quee Long, who is about the opposite of any decent Virgo. For shame, Eleanor Catton, you have betrayed the Zodiac with your libelous portrait of a so-called Virgo! Okay here's the one thing that bothered me about The Luminaries: the way it treated its Asian characters. Perhaps because I'm a hyper-critical half-breed who favors his Asian side, I'm always on the look-out for things to irritate me in the way that Asians are represented. Now I don't think that Catton has an issue with Asians, but it does chafe on a personal level how little they are respected in this novel. I understand the lack of respect coming from other characters, given the time and place. But I resented their actual parts and paths in the narrative - and that's all Eleanor Catton. One Asian is presented as single-minded in the most simple and greedy way possible; another is an opium addict and merchant whose tragic life and grand quest for revenge end in a limp little fizzle, off of the page. I raged (a bit) at the injustice of it all. Libra the Scales is a sign of beauty, and much like Beauty itself, displays both grace and superficiality, charisma and vanity. Lovely, indecisive Libra! Libra's scales are seldom in balance; this sign seeks to make things equal and often fails. And so it is with the author of The Luminaries, a Libra on the cusp of Virgo. Her favorites among the novel's astrological characters are dynamic and richly developed; those less-favored are given mere cameo appearances. But don't look for fairness from a Libra - look for beauty! And there is much beauty within the pages of The Luminaries. Exquisite prose, gorgeous imagery, lovely moments within its lovely love story; the beautiful mind of its author, yearning to be recognized for its brilliance - and rewarded by the 2013 Man Booker Prize. Libra is represented - perfectly - by Harald Nilssen, a commission merchant. Scorpio is the Scorpion , and the Eagle as well. It soars above the earth and lives in its holes. This strange sign is the Investigator of the Zodiac and is also its greatest conundrum - secretive to its core, yet suspicious of secrets in others; dark and unyielding; often cold yet deeply sexual. Mysterious, obsessive Scorpio! The Luminaries is intimately connected to the Scorpion, in its basic nature as a Mystery Novel and in its refusal to solve certain mysteries, to keep them shrouded in ambiguity. The Eagle dislikes having to explain itself. Scorpio is represented by Joseph Pritchard, a chemist and a perfectly executed character who is left almost entirely off of the page. Perhaps Catton feared the perverse potential lurking within him and so curtailed her exploration of his depths. I also felt the Scorpio influence upon this novel's villain, the dark, manipulative, unknowable Francis Carver. Sagittarius the Archer shoots an arrow into the future, his true place; Sagittarius the Centaur gallops quickly, heedless of those too simple and slow to keep his pace. Strong-willed, independent Sagittarius! This sign's influence on The Luminaries is striking: it has no patience for readers of the idiot class. It makes scarce concessions to those longing for explanations or a simple plotline; it will give you the opportunity to come into its world and be surrounded, enveloped... and it will leave you behind if you are unable to keep up. Sagittarius is well-represented by Thomas Balfour, a shipping agent. Capricorn the Sea-Goat : \"still waters run deep\" was surely coined for this sign, one whose stable and inhibited surface appearance belies the complicated ambitions within. Patient, resourceful Capricorn! A courageous introvert, a fastidious intellectual, virile yet chilly, dignified and aloof and rich with hidden depths. The novel The Luminaries was born under the sign of Capricorn. The novel's birth sign is represented - perfectly - by Aubert Gascoigne, a justice's clerk. Aquarius the Water-bearer abhors restrictions and eschews barriers, seeking the enlightenment beyond, traveling the stars without and within, ever in search of wisdom. Inventive, rebellious Aquarius! A shallow reviewer of the novel would find little influence from the Water-bearer as the book is a carefully constructed puzzle rather than an ingenious invention, a mathematically mapped-out pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance rather than a spontaneous improvisation. But dig deeper and you shall find the sublime Aquarian ruling an eerie and haunting love story, one full of unexplainable visions and brazen leaps of faith. Aquarius is well-represented by Sook Yongsheng, a Chinese hatter and lover of opium. Pisces the Fish , Pisces the dreamer, the last sign and the oldest. Pisces yearns for escape, in dreams, in drugs, in art, in the dark damp spaces. Elusive Pisces, the sign of self-undoing! I had a Piscean experience when reading this novel. It was my go-to book for a certain period of time, a little bit nearly every morning and every afternoon, for almost 3 months. I escaped into its depths, it was my sweet sweet drug and I fear that I am suffering from withdrawal. This lengthy review was an attempt to live in it again. Alas, now even this review is over. Pisces is represented - rather poorly - by Cowell Devlin, a chaplain. ...more \u201cThe proper way to understand any social system was to view it from above.\u201d \u2015 Eleanor Catton, The Luminaries There is certainly a lot to like about Eleanor's novel.

The plot is interesting, but at times ends up being a little redundant. Do we really need to look at the same event from twelve different angles? OK, I'm not sure if that actually ever happens, but at points in the novel it felt like it did. The problem with Catton is all the writers I want to compare her to (Pynchon, Dickens, Carey, Nabokov) demolish her prose. Her language while precise didn't twinkle or thrill me. Her plot while interesting didn't pull OR push me. Her characters while curious didn't move or provoke me. And her setting, while exotic didn't capture or entice me. I want to give her credit for her MFA/MCW-boxed ambition, but great literature can't be solely rewarded for its ambition and potential. 'The Luminaries' lacked the heart, soul and transcendence that a book about the stars and lovers almost demands. She belongs on the shelf next to Eggers, just not next to Nabokov. ...more Disclaimer: I received this book as part of the Goodreads \"First Reads\" program. A short word before I get into my review.

A short word before I get into my review. I understand that this book just isn't for me. It's longlisted for the Booker, Goodreads reviewers generally love it, the author is a real up-and-comer... but it just didn't do it for me. I think it may have been unfortunate that I read this book so quickly after reading another that really blew me away (Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates), so I kept comparing them (even if I didn't want to or mean to) as I read this one. As a quick glance into my mindset, I'll post a comparison here and maybe you can understand why I just couldn't get into the book. Both books included parts where people were looking into mirrors, as a way for the author to describe what drives these superficial, yet self-conscious, people. One of my favorite passages from Revolutionary Road describes *so much* about the character in a single line: \"He looked at himself in the mirror, tightening his jaw and turning his head a little to one side to give it a leaner, more commanding look, the face he had given himself in mirrors since boyhood and which no photograph had ever quite achieved...\" Amazing. One glance in a mirror and we see how superficial and vulnerable this person is. In The Luminaries, Catton describes a man looking into a mirror in this way. I find it to be terribly long-winded and boring: \"Moody was not unaware of the advantage his inscrutable grace afforded him. Like most excessively beautiful persons, he had studied his own reflection minutely and, in a way, knew himself from the outside best; he was always in some chamber of his mind perceiving himself from the exterior. He had passed a great many hours in the alcove of his private dressing room, where the mirror tripled his image into profile, half-profile and square: Van Dyck's Charles, though a good deal more striking. It was a private practice, and one he likely would have denied - for how roundly self-examination is condemned, by the moral prophets of our age! As if the self had no relation to the self, and one only looked in mirrors to have one's arrogance confirmed; as if the act of self-regarding was not as subtle, fraught and ever-changing as any bond between twin souls. In his fascination Moody sought less to praise his own beauty than to master it. Certainly whenever he caught his own reflection, in a window box, or in a pane of glass after nightfall, he felt a thrill of satisfaction - but as an engineer might feel, chancing upon a mechanism of his own devising and finding it splendid, flashing, properly oiled and performing exactly as he had predicted it should.\" Wow. That's a mouthful that does two things: 1. describes how vulnerable he is via his superficial nature, just like the single line used by Yates, and 2. puts me to sleep. I like the bit about the engineer, it's a great line. That plus one other sentence would have been sufficient. But this book is filled with paragraphs upon paragraphs, pages upon pages, which could be cut out completely or at least shortened considerably. It's over 800 pages that could literally be used to fend off a home intruder. I worry that some young authors feel that they have to write a two-inch-thick saga in order to be taken seriously. I really struggled to read it and found that time was grinding to a halt. I read so I can relax and enjoy being swept away into another world. If this other world is so boring and tortuous that it makes me want to stop reading, it's just not worth it. I obviously don't \"get\" the book. It's nothing against the author, who will have a long and fruitful career even though I didn't like what she wrote. I feel bad giving it one star, but given that this book made me dread the act of reading - something that I normally *love* - I really couldn't see any other alternative. ...more For me, at least, the greatest mystery of this massive whodunit is how it won the Booker Prize.

While the reviewer sees these traits as a mark of (meta)literary genius, for me it was just the opposite: \"But it is also a massive shaggy dog story; a great empty bag; an enormous, wicked, gleeful cheat. For nothing in this enormous book, with its exotic and varied cast of characters whose lives all affect each other and whose fates are intricately entwined, amounts to anything like the moral and emotional weight one would expect of it. That's the point, in the end, I think, of The Luminaries. It's not about story at all. It's about what happens to us when we read novels \u2013 what we think we want from them \u2013 and from novels of this size, in particular. Is it worthwhile to spend so much time with a story that in the end isn't invested in its characters?\" In that respect, my answer is decidedly \"no,\" in marked contrast to my experience reading Hannah Kent's Burial Rites - a spare, but beautifully written historical novel of few yet deeply invested characters that also unravels a murder mystery. And which, to deepen the mystery, wasn't even longlisted for the Booker Prize. Go figure. ...more The Luminaries won the Man Booker Prize in 2013 so obviously I had to someday read it.

It\u2019s heavy!! I\u2019m not a fan of weighty books (I have weak wrists) but the gods of Booker were calling me soooo I took the plunge and borrowed it from the library. So what is The Luminaries about??? After 832 pages you think I\u2019d have an answer for you right?????? Yeah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.*grumbles* Okay, okay I am being facetious. It was about solving a series of mysterious occurrences and crimes in 1800s New Zealand when mining the goldfields was the way to make your fortune. So you could say that The Luminaries at its heart was a love story between man and gold! Sing it random dance song whose artist I don\u2019t recall!!!!! It\u2019s all about the money!!! But the reason I was facetious about the plot of this book is because of how long the story took to get going. Oh my god 360 pages of set-up...sooooooooo exhausting!!! (And even after that the story still didn\u2019t feel like it was progressing that much.) Needless to say it got tedious!! So I guess you could say, \u2018hey Emer! It seems it was a slow burner, I thought you always said you LIKED slow burners???\u2019 And you know what? You would absolutely positively 100% be right!! I LOVE a good slow burner. Oh when the plot is filled with atmosphere, tension, gorgeous descriptions, in depth characterisations\u2026. Gimme Gimme GIMME!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS however\u2026\u2026\u2026 Oh. My. God. D.U.L.L. So here\u2019s the thing Eleanor Catton IS a great writer. Absolutely! Positively!! Yes!!! What she is not , is a good editor!!!! If she can describe one tiny element of person or situation in one paragraph then it is MUCH too brief for her. She needs to write at least two pages about the one thing! And more often than not, it\u2019s not even relevant to the main storyline. And as I said it is lovely to have everything so detailed and described... but to a point!!! If you get too much of one thing it makes you feel queasy. Or it gets boring, dull, repetitive!!! I just wanted to tear my eye balls out from the tediousness of her writing style at times. IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH!!!! I guess I can see how the critics fawned over this writing and her wonderful grasp on the English language but it felt like showing off!!! \u2018Hey look, I just thought of another way to say this super smart thing so I\u2019m going to put this in there too\u2026.\u2019 *face palm* Sometimes less IS more\u2026 know what I\u2019m saying??????? And then we get to the omniscient narrator, narrators, whatever\u2026\u2026. He, she, we, it\u2026 I do not care!!!! We get it dear all-knowing and powerful narrator!!! You are smart. You are wise. You are always in control directing us poor meek clueless readers\u2026. SPARE ME!!!!!!!!! There is nothing I hate more than a patronising narrator. And good gosh this was a patronising narrator. Oh the arguments I had with this creature\u2026 be glad dear goodreaders that you weren\u2019t present to hear the air turning very blue as I unleashed yet another diatribe of expletives on this omniscient douchebag! So let\u2019s talk about the actual book characters. 832 pages they must have been beautifully detailed, exquisite backstories, multi layered, multi-faceted, multi-everything!!! You\u2019d think right??? What we got were pastiches at best. Yes characters had some backstory but they all felt uninspired to me. Predictable. Lacking emotion. Not one character did I feel anything for\u2026 not hate, not love, not even like\u2026 just a whole lot of apathy. But you kept reading for 832 pages Emer and your status updates stated that you enjoyed the book?? Explain that one!! Hi! My name is Emer and I love to argue with books. In fact I often talk back at them\u2026 it\u2019s weird I know!! I have also been known to fire books across rooms (carefully avoiding both small animals and breakables, because animal abuse is wrong and I have to pay for any damage) but then I pick them back up again because love/hate relationships are my jam! See I get this perverse pleasure out of disagreeing with books, especially books with omniscient narrators!!! And even though the writing was oh-so-tedious, in places it was brilliant AND the plot was rather good!!!!! I know, I JUST PRAISED THE BOOK *shocked faces all around* Let\u2019s talk about the plot without spoilers please!! Okay\u2026 ahhh this is hard!!! Well as you can imagine at 832 pages this was a plot that kept building and building, and building some more!! The author was very smart with her plot; I will definitely give her that. The whole book was like a puzzle that you had to piece together to figure out the final picture and it was a WHOLE lot of fun!!! Ahhh this is how you do plot twists and turns. I loved how the story built up to a certain day and an event\u2026 and then the story moved back in time piecing together all the little snippets of information until the final picture was revealed. Nicely done\u2026 UNTIL \u2026 The last few pages\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 *sigh* Oh we were doing so well dear Luminaries but just go away with your ridiculous ending!!! After 832 pages it needed a stronger finish. It\u2019s not that the story leaves you hanging nastily or anything, although as you might know I do like open-ended narratives\u2026 It\u2019s just that it was weak; too quiet. It needed to finish with a bit more fanfare than say a dirge! *sad face* Okay what about all the cool astrological stuff in the book??? I heard that the chapter layout does this really awesome winding down thing??? Ah the astrological crap stuff\u2026 It was more of a quirky thing than anything; something to make the book stand out from the masses. Basically different characters were represented by different stellar and planetary objects, and at the beginning of each chapter you could figure out certain things about the events and characters in that chapter\u2026 It wasn\u2019t crucial to the storyline; in fact I would go so far as to say wasn\u2019t necessary but it was a bit of fun! And I know nothing about astrology and I was able to figure (most) of it out so it shouldn\u2019t put anyone off reading the book. As for the chapter thing? Well the book is divided into 12 parts and each part is subdivided into chapters. Part one has 12 chapters, part 2 has 11, part 3 has 10 etc until part 12 ends with just the one chapter. Bit of a gimmick!! If the chapter lengths had been roughly equivalent then I would have been more convinced that this was integral to the story but the final 8 parts took place over 120 pages or so??? And the first four parts took roughly 710 pages!! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was VERY grateful that those last 8 parts picked up the pace because the story needed it desperately ; it\u2019s just that sometimes I felt chapters were only called chapters for the sake of this theme and that on many occasions they were just awkwardly divided up. So the big question is overall did you like The Luminaries and would you recommend it? It\u2019s a case of yes and no for liking the book. I am going to award it three stars because it took A LOT of effort to write and absolute respect for that, the plot was intricately woven and I LOVED that\u2026 but the narrator needed to be punched, the book needed some serious editing and the characters needed to be more rounded\u2026 so I think three is fair enough!! And as for recommending it\u2026 HELL YEAH!!! It\u2019s so fun to be all superior and smug at the dinner table saying that you frequently read Booker Prize winners. Way to make your other friends who are only into reading FSoG and gossip mags feel inadequate!!! I absolutely would recommend it because even though this book frequently drove me to the point of insanity it was kinda fun getting that annoyed!! And also I\u2019d really like to discuss this book with my Goodreads friends so READ IT!!!!! And if I can't convince you with my utterly ridiculous and essentially nonsensical review then read Medini\u2019s super awesome review instead. She had a much more positive experience with the book and as I always say, it's always best to get a few differing opinions if you are on the fence about starting a book. three stars ------- 832 pages and THAT'S the freaking ending!!!!!! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?? All of that build up and puzzle clicking and that's the ending the author chose to go with... *eye roll* And this won the Booker Prize in 2013??? L.O.L. Review to come... ---------- 832 pages long and it weighs more than my dog... Okay that's a slight exaggeration and my dog is freaking tiny but still!!!! JUST THINK OF MY POOR WRISTS PEOPLE!!!!!!! But this book is award winning and oh how I do love to hate recipients of The Man Booker Prize... And then there was Medini's awesome review which is what really swayed me into adding this to my TBR so when I saw this in the library today I had to take it home with me! Wish me luck!! ...more Wow, I have never ever in my life read a book like this before!

It basically feels like Eleanor Catton took my mind and tossed it into a tornado before letting everything settle in great understanding. Are you confused by this description? Well, that's what this book does to you. This story takes its focal point in Walter Moody, but at the same time it's not at all about Walter Moody. It is set in New Zealand among gold diggers; however, very little of the story deals with actual gold digging. I think what impresses people the most about this book is the way it is beautifully structured around stars and destinies among stars. The first chapters are endless with one-line introductions - the last chapters are shorter than their introductions. Everything fits perfectly, and this perfection entwines with the story which starts out as a confusing mess but ends with all the answers. I need to reread this book someday because this is one of those books that you need to read again in order to understand everything. However, if you've never read it, I recommend that you do so because this is quite a unique reading experience! :-) ...more The Luminaries: What Hath Eleanor Catton Wrought?

It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.-Macbeth, Act Five, Scene Five, William Shakespeare Eleanor Catton remains the youngest woman to have been awarded The Man Booker Prize. Her novel, The Luminaries , logging in at eight hundred thirty four pages, is the longest novel to have received the award. Ms. Catton is one of only two New Zealanders who has won this distinguished literary prize. These interesting tidbits of information do not address, nor should address the literary merit of this massive novel. Having quoted Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" I do not intimate that The Luminaries should be considered a tale told by an idiot. Oh, no. Catton has artfully crafted a complex behemoth of a tale of the Gold Rush of 1866 in New Zealand. This is a work that carries great promise. The scope of Catton's cast of characters intimates she has done her research on the New Zealand gold fields. The ultimate question is whether Catton's tale, artfully crafted or not, leaves the reader with the satisfaction of having completed a work that leaves a lasting impression, or at least some semblance of significance. The Luminaries is replete with diggers, businessmen, politicians, Chinese miners and dispensers of opium, ladies of the evening, to use the appropriate Victorian vernacular. The plot winds through time, conveying the reader through the perceptions of a dozen characters. It stands to reason that while the perception of an individual may constitute reality to that particular person, the perceptions of twelve different individuals definitely does not constitute a reality the reader may recognize as accurate. Careening through Catton's convoluted plot, her players strutting upon her literary stage never develop substantive form. They are incomplete shadows. We never develop a true sense of who these people are. This novel has been called a parody of the Victorian novel. The reader is tempted to resort to the term Dickensian. The name Wilkie Collins has also been bandied about as a writer whose style Catton so ably captured. However, what is obviously Catton's cleverness in the construction of this novel, leaves this reviewer with the impression of having been told a joke overly long that concludes with a punchline that did not merit the length of the telling. And, so it goes. ...more Punching below its weight Maybe the fashion for the kind of book that would land you in the Accident and Emergency Department of your local hospital if you dropped it on your foot has to do with a reaction against our concentration-challenged age of swift soundbites, manic multi-tasking and permanent drip feed of tweets and messages that collude to reduce our ability to focus long and lovingly on one task to the level of a mosquito on speed.

David Mitchell recently embraced modern technology by publishing a story on twitter. On my calculation, that format would take around two weeks just to get through the Character Chart that is so helpfully placed at the beginning of this hefty tome. So, here we have 832 pages of what is a very clever, intricate, well-written, historical mystery novel. But even reading for several hours at a time, an indulgence made easier by the fact that we have no TV blethering in a corner of the room, and more difficult by the fact that there is a need to earn a bit of money and speak to people and get off the sofa and move about a bit sometimes, it still took me eight days to plough through all 832. Why on earth, I kept asking myself. Ruth Rendell is just as good, if less historically minded, if I want a cheery bit of murder and mayhem and a nice wee puzzle solved at the end. Why on earth does Ms Catton have the gall to expect me to spend so much time on a glorious gallimaufry that gets untangled quite nicely, yes, thank you, but at great, irritating length? And how, oh how, did this ever win a literary prize? Indeed, one of the respected literary prizes. It is competent, no question about it. The puzzle is very intricately plotted, and everything comes together satisfactorily, no loose threads left dangling to snag on a hangnail, no. But why does Ms Catton have to take three hundred and eighty seven pages on her exposition alone? Well, for one thing she does take loving care over her characters, taking paragraphs to carefully fill in all the details of their appearance and personality. And it is all wonderfully done, yes, but the thing is it doesn't matter . Walter Moody, for example, physically attractive, easy to get on with, roguish, unsullied vigour, uninclined to sulk, people take to him easily, Edinburgh background, troubled family, not superstitious, blah blah blah blah bah, but then, having met this charming chappie, we never see him again for around 350 pages, and when we do, he is there in order to resume and summarise the intriguing and complex set-up, helpful, yes, but his character is entirely irrelevant to the function he has to fulfill. All we really need to know about him is that he has some legal training, because later he will do a fantastic job in The Courtroom Scene. But whether he wears yellow trousers or grey, or blows his nose into a hanky or his fingers doesn't make any difference to that. I'm sure that Ms. Catton was trying to be helpful, build up a picture in the reader's mind, so that she would recognize the bank clerk, the commission merchant, the justice's clerk when she meets them again. But this particular reader had trouble storing quite so much information about 15 white men, so I ended up thinking that maybe Dickens got it right, giving a character an unmistakeable quirk: an odd name like Uriah Heep, or an eccentric way of speaking, like Jingle. Dickens' characters may have been flat, but as Forster said, they vibrate very fast. But for all that, a literary prize winner that demands so much time should offer more, surely? Layers, depths, something that quivers and resonates with more than mere curiosity to see how it works out? I thought I had spotted the odd hint: a thought about loyalty opposed to honesty; the conflict between different codes of morality, amongst the men of the goldfields opposed to official, legal authority; how hard it is to break out of our own concepts. But they fizzled out very swiftly, so that all I was left with was the weird astrology stuff, Venus in Aries, True Node in Sagittarius, Jupiter in Aspic. Whatever. Are we really expected to take all this seriously? I don't think so. Oh, and how clever the structure is, each section half the length of the one before and so on - it's admirably clever, but it doesn't mean anything. It has done one thing for me. Apart from exercising my flexor carpi ulnaris. I have decided to go more with non-fiction for a while. It doesn't feel like quite such a waste of time. ...more If I were to rank the books I\u2019ve read during the last five years (and there are over 500 of them) in order of enjoyment, Eleanor Catton\u2019s The Rehearsal would be right at the top of the list.

I bought it on a whim, knowing nothing about it; I was nearly put off by its mannered style; but then everything clicked into place, and I ended up with one of the greatest reading experiences of my life. Naturally, then, I\u2019ve been eager ever since to read a second novel by Catton. Four years after reading The Rehearsal , I have now had that opportunity. At first sight, The Luminaries appears a very different proposition from Catton\u2019s debut: at 830 pages in hardback, it is more than twice the length of The Rehearsal . Where the first novel was set in a deliberately non-specific contemporary Western milieu, the new book is tied firmly to a time and place: the New Zealand gold rush town of Hokitika in 1865-6. Where The Rehearsal was fractured and stylised, The Luminaries has the appearance of being more conventional: the chronology leaps back at one point, and the novel\u2019s twelve parts grow progressively shorter, but there\u2019s nothing as obvious as The Rehearsal \u2019s non-linear blurring of realities; and Catton\u2019s prose remains within a largely convincing 19th-century idiom. Things are not as simple as they seem, however. What made The Rehearsal stand out so much for me was how its unconventional form and style so completely embodied its central concern of performance, and reflected that back in myriad ways throughout the book. Catton does the same thing in The Luminaries , with a different set of concerns \u2013 but the extent of it only becomes apparent once you\u2019ve finished. Before I get further into that, some plot: we begin on 27 January 1866, when Walter Moody, a Scottish lawyer, walks into the smoking room of Hokatika\u2019s Crown Hotel, disturbing twelve men in conference. Gradually gaining their trust, Moody hears their story: a couple of weeks earlier, a hermit named Crosbie Wells was found dead in his cottage, and a not inconsiderable fortune soon after. Around the same time, a young woman was found unconscious from opium in the road, apparently having tried to commit suicide. Through acquaintance with each other, each of the twelve men discovered that he was somehow connected to these events; so they decided to gather together in this room to discuss what may have happened, and what could be done. As the novel progresses, more and more connections between the characters become apparent, revealing a complex and dastardly plot. It\u2019s not for me to say much more about the twists and turns; but I will say that, if you want a page-turning murder mystery, you will find one in The Luminaries . This book is as tense and exciting a read as I have come across in a long time. But Catton does not stop there. If you read any articles about The Luminaries , you\u2019ll soon hear about its elaborate astrological underpinning. Twelve of Catton\u2019s characters (the twelve men interrupted by Walter Moody) represent the signs of the zodiac; another seven represent planetary bodies (Moody is Mercury, for instance). Catton calculated the horoscope for Hokatika during the calendar year in which The Luminaries is set, and transposed the changing positions of each body into the relationships between her characters. Now, for many readers (including myself), I suspect this would not be a satisfactory end in itself: if you don\u2019t know much about astrology, you won\u2019t spot the connections; if you don\u2019t believe in it, then you probably won\u2019t care anyway. But what this astrological foundation does, to my mind, is set up some of the novel\u2019s main subtexts. One of these, as I\u2019ve hinted above, is the idea of connection and relation. This is perhaps most obvious in the mystery itself: \u2018there is no truth except truth in relation\u2019 (p. 364), as Catton\u2019s omniscient narrator puts it; and, indeed, no single character knows the full truth of Crosbie Wells\u2019s death, or the plot going on around it. But we also see this theme manifest in the way that so many of the characters are trying to forge their own paths in life, to act on or against the world (gold prospectors in search of a life-transforming nugget, of course, but others as well), yet are scuppered by the actions of others. Catton\u2019s characters are enmeshed in a web of interdependence that they can only begin to comprehend. But the zodiac is not only a structure for connecting relationships in this novel; it\u2019s also an artificial pattern imposed by humans on the night sky \u2013 and most of the characters have no truck with it. There are several ways in which Catton examines how we try to impose order on reality, and the implications and limitations of doing so. A murder mystery, for example, traditionally relies on a pattern being imposed upon seemingly unconnected facts. There are two major scenes in The Luminaries where this happens: when Moody sums up the accounts of the men in the Crown Hotel, and a later courtroom scene. Both of these sequences end with someone rushing in to announce an unexpected development. It\u2019s a rather melodramatic device, but I see it as a literal interruption of disorder: the facts have been arranged to the characters\u2019 satisfaction; everything seems to make sense \u2013 then in comes someone to reveal that it doesn\u2019t. A classic fictional edifice is undermined with one of its own tools. More pointedly than murder mysteries, there\u2019s another example of a pattern placed over reality in the form of the gold mines themselves. These affect the world physically, silting up the Hokitika River; and Catton never allows us to forget that this is land which once belonged to the Maori. \u2018You with your greenstone, us with our gold. It might just as well be the other way about,\u2019 says one character to the Maori Te Rau Tauwhare. \u2018No,\u2019 replies Tauwhare, \u2018it is not the same\u2019 (p. 814) \u2013 but that is as much as we hear. These issues may not be explored in detail in The Luminaries (the book's structure restricts Tauwhare's voice, mirroring the wider society) but Tauwhare still speaks eloquently, for all that he does not say. I said earlier that each of the novel\u2019s twelve parts is shorter than the last; more precisely, each part is half the length of the previous one (so Part I is nearly half the book, part XII just a few dozen words). This gives The Luminaries the shape of a golden spiral. It also acts like a spiral \u2013 or, to keep up the celestial theme, a black hole, stripping out information as it goes. Though the novel begins with the immersive detail of a mystery, when the focus moves back to 1865 to tell the events leading up to Crosbie Wells\u2019s murders, the chapters then get shorter and shorter \u2013 the narrative breaks apart. Here, the novel begins to embody the tension between the open future and rueful hindsight, the sense of predestination and the sense of free will. The summaries heading each chapter (all beginning: 'In which...') take on more of the detail. Without these, each chapter would be a floating fragment of time with no context; the only reason we can place them is that we know what has come afterwards. So the novel spirals down to a singularity, a moment poised between the infinite possibility ahead for those experiencing it, and the inevitable tragedy that we know will unfold. What may seem foreordained after the event is, we see, nothing of the sort in the present moment. I finished The Luminaries grinning from ear to ear at the experience of having read a novel so completely and idiosyncratically realised. Moments like that are one reason I read books in the first place; and they\u2019re why, for me, Eleanor Catton belongs in the first rank of authors writing today. ...more jeez!!! holy smokes, you guys!! i finished this book nearly a week ago now and have been struggling so hard with my thoughts on it. i didn't love it and i didn't dislike it, but there's something i just can't quite put my finger on here, that made the book feel kind of off for me. i had been anticipating this read so, so much, so i definitely feel disappointed. i don't think my expectations were sky-high and impossible though. i have not yet read catton's first novel, The Rehearsal , though i do o jeez!!! holy smokes, you guys!! i finished this book nearly a week ago now and have been struggling so hard with my thoughts on it. i didn't love it and i didn't dislike it, but there's something i just can't quite put my finger on here, that made the book feel kind of off for me. i had been anticipating this read so, so much, so i definitely feel disappointed. i don't think my expectations were sky-high and impossible though. i have not yet read catton's first novel, The Rehearsal , though i do own it. so my excitement was not based on already being a big fan from her previous work. i think my expectations were mostly based on the book's setting - i really have not read very much new zealand-based fiction, and then the chunk-factor was running high for me -- it's a big, fat novel, 800+ pages. YAY!! i did really enjoy when the book focused on the location and described the settings. that was probably my favourite bit. but this book is, i think, more complicated than it needs to be. when i say complicated...i don't mean hard or challenging. there are a lot of characters (20 of them) and a thread of plot is woven through each one. they are all tied together by a single plot point. this is fine -- the characters are distinct enough and interesting enough that they aren't confusing. but to stretch out one single aspect of any novel, for more than 800 pages...well, it's a lot. the narrative is non-linear. i am fine with that. and as much as i love big, fat books...i think this book could have been amazing if 200-300 pages were edited out. there were definitely times when i felt like i was just reading padding and imaging what might have been in a tighter telling? there is a bit of a gimmick going on too, with over-informative chapter introductions, (for example: chapter titled \"Mercury in Aquarius\" : \"In which Moody passes on some vital information, and Sook Yongsheng presents him with a gift.\" which is a less informative example, to avoid spoilers for you all...but you get the idea.) astrological signs and stellar & planetary phases. for me, this aspect of the story was a bit too much telling from the author. i understand the intros to each chapter may be borrowing from victorian lit., but it didn't add to the novel. in fact, it served to irritate me and i tended to skip over them, then read them once i had finished a chapter. re: astrological signs and moon phases: the characters were well-drawn, we were able to gain a solid picture of what they were each about without the padding from their star signs. i think i get what catton was aiming for in this purposeful choice - some characters are represented in the 'stellar' phase of the novel and others are 'planetary'. one man = dry land/earth. there are 12 related houses (settings) and 7 related influences (reason, desire, force, command...) how much in life is based on internal forces/choices and how much is external/fate? but it just didn't work for me. it was a bit twee. so...since finishing the read, i have been reading many, many reviews for the book, trying to wrap my head around my own thoughts and feelings. overwhelmingly, this book is loved. the critics are a-gushing. of course, if you follow these things, the luminaries was longlisted shortlisted won the 2013 booker prize. so i am glad i read this one. as the book becomes more widely read, i will be interested to hear what others think. ...more This is my speech for the launch of Eleanor Catton's The Luminaries at Unity Books in Wellington, 3 August 2013.

This is the South Island of New Zealand, circa 1866, in the wet, green folds of the Southern Alps where they tumble into the Tasman Sea. Eleanor Catton\u2019s The Luminaries is also the frontier of storytelling\u2014a no-holds-barred, raucous flight of imagination that I devoured with Epicurean pleasure. Jumping into its alphabet-soup cast of characters with chewy names like Emery Staines (an angelic young man, popular, rich and missing), Cowell Devlin (a man of God), George Shepard (whose flocks are housed in the town jail) and Anna Wetherell (a prostitute~ingenue who weathers all kinds of storms) is like tumbling in a dryer with towels and tennis shoes. You never know when you\u2019ll get smacked upside the head with a plot twist. This is a Gold Rush-era version of The Usual Suspects : Everyone\u2019s got a story and no one is telling the truth. In this case, a hermitic prospector is dead, the town\u2019s richest man is missing, a prostitute is senseless and wearing a dress lined with gold, a politician is being blackmailed, a body rises from its makeshift coffin in a doomed ship\u2019s cargo hold and a beautiful redhead has just sashayed into town, claiming to be a widow and seeking what remains of her husband\u2019s estate. Spinning all around this stage are twelve Luminaries: a constellation of men whose points of view we dip into throughout the novel, trying to unravel a mystery that is woven more tightly with each page. Much has been made of Catton\u2019s clever structure: The Luminaries is a set piece held aloft by an astrological chart that divides each part into smaller and smaller sections (Part One is 358 pages long; Part Twelve, two), according to celestial logic. But don\u2019t be deterred by this ornamentation. I didn\u2019t pay a whit of attention to the charts that precede each section\u2014I couldn\u2019t be distracted from carrying on with the story. Yet, there is something to be said for Catton\u2019s conceit. The novel begins with a crowded, opulent jumble of characters and detail, like a sky full of dazzling stars. As its 832 pages turn, black space is allowed in, the focus narrows and individual details begin to sharpen. The tale is told first from outside-in, then inside-out, from high to low, back-to-front, by the dead and the living, in court, in bed and in confession. Mystery is added to adventure and star-crossed love eventually conquers all. I can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve taken such delight in reading, when I felt the author\u2019s sheer joy in writing. I've seen a handful of gripes that Catton\u2019s story and style lack warmth and her characters are shallow. I dunno. I didn\u2019t get a sense that she intended to write epic historical fiction in which the characters\u2019 characters rise and fall and rise again and we feel morally lifted from the lessons learned. Sometimes it\u2019s perfectly all right for the reading experience to be sheer pleasure. When it\u2019s not only pleasurable, but intellectually stimulating, laugh-out-loud surprising and historically illuminating, you\u2019ve got a five-star read. Eleanor Catton has crafted a rollicking, unexpected and deeply satisfying carnival ride that ends all too soon. I doff my top hat and bow. Brava. ...more Why I did not want to read this book initially: 1. This book won the Booker Prize in 2013 .

I didn\u2019t want to read such a huge book in the ebook format. But then I visited a library recently and my sister picked this book up. It took me almost a week to read it, but I am SO GLAD . Coz The Luminaries blew me away. It is 1866, and young Walter Moody has come to make his fortune upon the New Zealand goldfields. On the stormy night of his arrival, he stumbles across a tense gathering of twelve local men who have met in secret to discuss a series of unexplained events: A wealthy man has vanished, a prostitute has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk. Moody is soon drawn into the mystery: a network of fates and fortunes that is as complex and exquisitely ornate as the night sky. This is not just a book. It is a masterpiece with a marvelously structured storyline, a devilishly intricate plot and superlative writing. \u2018\u2026 his memory, recoiling upon itself, had met its obverse, the power of forgetting, and had conjured the mist and driving rain as a kind of cloth, spectral, to screen him from the shapes of his own recent past.\u2019 Why should you read this book? 1. Firstly, the most unique thing about The Luminaries is its structure. There are 12 chapters, each of which is almost exactly half the length of the previous. So the chapters go on decreasing in length steadily, till the twelfth chapter wherein the introduction is longer than the content itself. Also, the book is constructed like the phases of the moon. The plot begins and 400 pages in, it reaches a climax. Then the flashbacks begin and the last chapter ends once again at the beginning. So it\u2019s really like the lunar cycle; the narrative is brought back around to meet its starting point. Incidentally, the city in which most of the story is set in, \u2018Hokitika\u2019, literally means \u2018full circle\u2019. 2. It is historical fiction set in 1865-66 . If you\u2019re a fan of this genre, then this book should be at the top of your TBR. 3. Unlike the Victorian London and American historical fiction setting (SO commonplace), this is set in New Zealand! Which is so refreshing! I\u2019ll be the first to admit that the cities and names were a little unusual, but it\u2019s still amazing! 4. The plot is centered on the New Zealand Gold Rush. We learn about diggers, the gold mines, the process of retorting and smelting gold, gold magnates, prospectors, the greed, corruption and yes, sometimes moral fiber that controls the actions of the characters. 5. There is a murder. But to call this book a murder mystery would be like calling Harry Potter a book about 'this boy who knows magic' , or A Game of Thrones a book about 'this girl with dragons' ! You get my drift, right? The Luminaries is so complex ; there are opium dens, s\u00e9ances, exotic dancing bars (\u201cThe House of Many Wishes\u201d), forgeries, long lost siblings, prostitutes, adultery, fraud, blackmail, theft, betrayal, politics, banking, shipping, insurance, finance, a fabulous courtroom scene and yes, there\u2019s a romance too. 6. There is an eclectic cast of morally ambiguous characters. They\u2019re written with a lot of insight and have their own flaws and quirks, which make them unique and unforgettable. There are 12 major ones, each represented by a zodiac sign. There are 5 other equally important characters represented by planets. Each chapter begins by telling you what\u2019s gonna happen, like, Jupiter in Sagittarius , so you can figure out who\u2019s Jupiter and you can relate the characteristics of Sagittarius to the character who represents it. It\u2019s not as tedious as it sounds. It\u2019s a lot of fun. 7. There\u2019s a paranormal element , which reveals itself towards the end. I loved, LOVED the cosmic twins theory connecting (view spoiler) [Anna Wetherell and Emery Staines (hide spoiler) ] , two of my favorite characters. Read more about this here . 8. The writing (for me) was spot on. Eleanor Catton \u2019s use of metaphors and her sentence construction drew me in like the sweet, intoxicating haze of opium smoke. \u2018\u2026 the bloody smell of slaughter intermingled with the sour, briny smell of the sea, putting one in mind, perpetually, of an untended icebox in which an uncured joint has spoiled.\u2019 \u2018Within minutes they sighed, became drowsy, and passed into the underwater moonscape of a strange, scarlet-tinted sleep.\u2019 9. You don\u2019t need to know a damn thing about astrology, mining, banking or shipping to savor this book. Every detail interspersed, every astrological chart at the beginning of each chapter contributes to this book\u2019s richness. 10. I\u2019m not ashamed to say I learnt a lot of new words. I mean, it\u2019s not every day you come across words such as \u2018chorister\u2019 or \u2018scree\u2019 or \u2018andiron\u2019 11. Eleanor Catton is fiendishly clever . She\u2019s woven these minute details, which seemingly make no sense, but are all part of the gloriously twisted web that is The Luminaries . For example, the value of the gold discovered is exactly 4096 pounds. 4096 is 2 to the power of 12 and there are 12 chapters. 12. When you do manage to sort out this tangled skein of plot threads and unravel all the mysteries, the revelation is like scattered stars finally forming a magnificent constellation and everything makes sense again. Bear in mind, this book isn\u2019t for everyone. I did object to a few parts, the excessive ill treatment of the Asians and the unequal page space for all the characters. Also, I would have liked to know more about Walter Moody and Ben Lowenthal. However, I finished the book with a dropped jaw and a mouth hanging open. I can\u2019t wait to re-read this beauty and witness the subtle nuances better, the second time around. *ALL THE STARS IN THE SKY* [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more The setting is in the gold rush days of 19th century New Zealand.

Just as astrology (which incidentally Catton regards as \u201csilly\u201d), represents the interaction of the planets and constellations, so goes the course of the story. Nothing is true except when compared to something else. (See Aaron's great review about the role of the astrology: http://www.typographicalera.com/lumin... ). But this is a framing device well cloaked in the Victorian story-telling style. It is an old-fashioned yarn, taking part in the \u2018olden days\u2019, and is replete with reprobates, whores, greedy graspers, moralising bigots, and a fair share of pompous white guys representing the self-regarding pillars of society. One Maori fella (a surprisingly minor role for the Maori in this tale) and a couple of Chinese characters from Chinatown round out the cast. Someone dies, by fair or foul means? And who gets his gold? The characters\u2019 psychologies are richly drawn: \u201cMoody was not unaware of the advantage his inscrutable grace afforded him.

They sought these women when they looked at Anna, but only partly, for they also sought themselves: she was a reflected darkness, just as she was a borrowed light. Her wretchedness was, she knew, extremely reassuring.\u201d Anna knows that \u2018A woman fallen has no future; a man risen has no past.\u2019 It is the exceptional psychological portraits and lyrical prose which elevates this beyond a Victorian murder mystery dressed up in a gimmicky device. It is a stellar achievement. ...more This is the most cliched review you'll read today but: Show, don't tell. Like come on, guys! To know this axiom is to have completed the third grade.

But all this quaintness and repetition got on my nerves. None of the nineteenth century novels I've read have been so redundant and long winded. I've read that writers should show and not tell; and cut anything that doesn't advance the story. Catton follows neither of these dictums. She does a lot of telling, and there is a lot of blah-blah-blah that doesn't advance the story, but merely repeats things we already know. Nevertheless, I gave this 3 stars, not 2, since the story and characters are interesting. So is the local color and history. Much of the book, including chapter headings, is structured around astrology. Hence the book's title, a pun referring to both heavenly bodies and inspiring people. The convoluted epic plot involves many characters. It mainly takes place in and around the New Zealand gold fields in 1865 and 1866, specifically in the towns of Hokitika and Kaniere. There are also some scenes on board various ships, especially the Godspeed, captained by Francis Carver, who I describe a bit more below. For the first half of the book, we learn very little, but the same facts are repeated over and over again. It's not until a meeting of twelve (get it? the twelve signs of the Zodiac) local men to share their separate knowledge of events (an artificial plot device if I ever saw one) that our understanding of the story advances. (Actually I think it becomes thirteen men, after one addition, but he's an outsider. Not positive I got those numbers right, though). The meeting starts at the book's beginning, but it's not until we're nearly half way through the novel that we get to piece the individual stories together. And it's not until nearly the end of the book that we learn most of the remainder of the story (in spite of the book's excessive length, we never really get the complete picture, which is also frustrating). I guess this is supposed to be a crime novel/murder mystery of sorts, although I don't think it's terribly successful along those lines. Fairly early in the book, a dead body shows up. Through an endless series of plot complications we eventually find out why it happened. Although honestly, at the end I still wasn't totally clear on all the details of how this character died. We meet a large and colorful cast of characters. We encounter most of them in Hokitika, although many have come there from elsewhere. There is Anna Wetherell, a pretty and popular local whore. She is unpretentious and straightforward (for the most part). Many local men enjoy Anna's company; several are in love with her. She develops an opium addiction. Crosbie Wells is the dead man. He was married to Lydia Wells (nee Greenway), a beautiful woman and a local entrepreneur/madame. At the time of Crosbie's death he and Lydia are separated. There's Dick Mannering, another local entrepreneur (also a whoremonger). Charlie Frost is a naive, young banker. There are two Chinese men: Sook Yongsheng, an indentured hatter (local terminology for someone who digs for gold alone) and small time Kaniere opium dealer; and Quee Long, a goldsmith. There's Jo Pritchard the local chemist (pharmacist) and Aubert Gascoigne, a Frenchman who clerks for a local judge. Alistair Lauderback is a politician running for office. Edgar Clinch runs the Gridiron, a Hokitika hotel. Te Rau Tauwhare is a Maori guide and interpreter, who hunts greenstone, which is esteemed by the Maoris. Irishman Cowell Devlin is the chaplain at the jail. George Shepard is the governor of the jail, and his wife is Margaret. Walter Moody, trained as a lawyer in Scotland, comes to dig for gold. Emery Staines, a rich young prospector who owns half of Hokitika, is missing and may also be dead. Last, but not least, is Francis Carver, a ship's captain and ex-convict. There are many other minor characters, such as various lawyers for the prosecution. About three quarters of the way through the book, there is a big court trial. This is mostly a plot device for us to find out more about what happened. Not a terribly original plot device, but I suppose it works. The story is quite convoluted. Besides, I don't want to reveal any spoilers. There's lots of plotting and double-crossing. Several characters have a virulent hatred of Chinamen. I won't say much more about the story itself. I wasn't always crazy about Mark Meadows' style of reading the audio. He got the many different types of accents correctly, I think. But sometimes he hammed it up; and I'm never wild about ham actors. He read Mrs. Wells as if she were a drag queen, exaggerating all of her speech. He did something similar with George Shepherd. Admittedly, both of these characters are jerks, but I think that could have been conveyed in a more understated way. I listened to the audiobook, but also read along in the Kindle version. I recommend looking at a physical or digital version of the book in addition to/instead of listening to it. There are illustrations and maps that one needs to see. Many of the chapter titles are astrological, and have accompanying charts ...more (view spoiler) [ Bettie's Books (hide spoiler) ] OMG OMG can I just do the gasp breathe gasp thing here Dobar krimi\u0107 nikada nije prvenstveno i nikada nije samo krimi\u0107.

I really wanted to like some of these men, care about what happens to them, but for all Catton's depth of description, I couldn't get involved. And who are the women in this novel? A couple of prostitutes -- and the only characters not fully realized. Sure, some of the plot has to do with them, but the women themselves are mostly in the wings. The zodiac allusions seemed to me to be an extraneous device imposed upon the plot. After about 400 of the 800 pages, the action begins.

I like unruly readers and unruly reading. Given this, I say again, I read *The Luminaries* wrong. And hopefully my experience will help others. It really boils down to one thing: Don't read this book as an E-book! Not only were the star charts so tiny on my Kindle as to strain vision as well as coherence, but also the plotting here is so intricate--new revelations constantly hearkening back to facts and characters you met glancingly at the beginning--that you MUST be able to easily skip back to refresh your memory. This book really invests in the materiality of the novel as an object that can be accessed in time from many different perspectives at many different moments. This is also Catton's perspective on history, psychology, and the supposed omniscience of the narrator. Her narrator and her characters ask whether any one or any story can be known without multiple fragmented perspectives. What she means, besides the obvious I've-sent-a-Victorian-novel-through-a-postmodern-prism effect, is FLIP AROUND IN HER BOOK. The fact that I couldn't flip around in her book (without frustrating loss of my virtual \"page\" and incessant back clicking) meant that I basically disregarded the star charts altogether. I have no idea how the characters interact with their astrological sign. The increasing slenderness of chapters only reminded me of the moon's cycle because a bunch of reviews told me that it was amazing that Catton used structure in this way. So, brava, Catton, for your marvelous, intricate structure! I did not have the patience or the medium to figure it all out. That being said, there were many things I liked about this book. It reminded me of Deadwood (without the fabulous obscenities that make the language of that show so rich); it introduced characters who were self-estranged because of the effects of empire and globalization (see the New Zealand-based banker homesick for an England he has never seen, the Maori jade digger who worries he's not spiritual enough); it pointed out the gendered nature of the gold-digging adventure story (men can strike it rich, women fall into prostitution). She also really does an amazing job capturing the tone of a chatty Victorian novel with its emphasis on plots and nefarious villains. Dickens and Wilkie Collins would be proud. I found some of the characters a bit flat as the result of the wide catalog of characters and their Victorian moral distribution into good and evil. One of the reviews I read claimed that part of the complexity of the novel lay in good characters doing bad things and bad characters doing good things, but I honestly found these shades of gray much less murky than did that critic. The hooker with a heart of gold and the earnest boy searching for his fortune turn out to be the heroes of this novel. I was much more interested in the more complex story of someone like Ah Sook, the victim of an imperial trade in opium *both* because he lost his fortune and good name through the machinations of a British trade and because of his addiction. (Though now that I type that out, that also feels a little obvious/stereotyped, no?) For me, this was a lackluster if exceedingly well-conceived book. I think it's very accomplished, and I wonder if I would have liked it better had I read it correctly. ...more // 4.5 I loved this book so much!

Auf diesen 1040 Seiten passiert so unfassbar viel, es tauchen zahlreiche Schl\u00fcsselfiguren auf und alles und jeder ist so miteinander verwoben und verflochten, dass es mir einfach nicht m\u00f6glich ist, die Geschichte richtig zu fassen und in wenigen S\u00e4tzen wiederzugeben \u2013 ich will es aber trotzdem einmal versuchen. Die Geschichte der Gestirne spielt zur Goldgr\u00e4berzeit in Neuseeland \u2013 viele junge M\u00e4nner machten sich zu der Zeit auf den Weg dorthin, in der Hoffnung auf Gold und damit einhergehendem Wohlstand. Auch der Schotte Walter Moody ist einer dieser erwartungsfrohen M\u00e4nner, der sich Anfang 1866 in Hokitika einfindet, hier aber nicht wie erwartet auf eine Goldader st\u00f6\u00dft, sondern auf eine scheinbar willk\u00fcrliche Versammlung von zw\u00f6lf M\u00e4nnern, die dabei sind, all die Geheimnisse und Verbrechen, die ihre kleine Stadt in der letzten Zeit heimgesucht haben, aufzukl\u00e4ren und eine plausible L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr all das zu finden \u2013 f\u00fcr den Tod eines scheinbar bedeutungslosen S\u00e4ufers und dem pl\u00f6tzlichen Auftauchen seiner unbekannten Witwe, \u00fcber die Tatsache, dass sich in seiner H\u00fctte ein unerkl\u00e4rliches Verm\u00f6gen befunden hat, \u00fcber das Verschwinden eines jungen Mannes und die Mysterien, die sich um eine opiums\u00fcchtige Hure ranken, um den fragw\u00fcrdigen und durchtriebenen Kapit\u00e4n eines Schiffes und \u00fcber noch so vieles mehr. Im Laufe der Geschichte finden sich zwar immer wieder Antworten auf all diese Geheimnisse, aber die Fragezeichen werden deswegen nicht weniger, weil es gleichzeitig auch immer wieder neue Erkenntnisse gibt und ach, es f\u00e4llt mir so schwer, Worte zu finden f\u00fcr diese unglaublich dicht gestrickte Geschichte, in der nahezu jeder mit jedem verbunden ist und sich jeder Handlungsstrang immer und immer und immer wieder mit denen der anderen verwebt und letztendlich ein undurchdringliches Gef\u00fcge ergibt, das dem Leser wirklich auf jede Frage eine Antwort bietet. F\u00fcr mich sticht allerdings nicht nur die Grandiosit\u00e4t dieser dichten Geschichte hervor, sondern insbesondere der Schreibstil \u2013 Eleanor Catton ist noch eine so junge Frau und Autorin und dennoch hat sie einen unheimlich ausgereiften und wunderbaren Schreibstil, der sehr ausf\u00fchrlich und malerisch und einfach gekonnt ist und den Anschein erweckt, als h\u00e4tte dieses Buch ein erfahrener Autor und nicht eine so junge Frau, wie sie es ist, geschrieben. An dieser Stelle muss auch ein gro\u00dfes Lob an die \u00dcbersetzerin, Melanie Walz, ausgesprochen werden, der eine fantastische \u00dcbersetzung gelungen ist. Das ganze Buch lie\u00df sich angenehm lesen und war vor allem auch dank der ausgeschm\u00fcckten S\u00e4tze so sch\u00f6n zu lesen \u2013 es hat einfach richtig Spa\u00df gemacht und sich wie ein echtes Meisterwerk angef\u00fchlt! Dabei spielt wohl auch die Wahl eines auktorialen Erz\u00e4hlers f\u00fcr die Schilderung dieses Romans eine gro\u00dfe Rolle \u2013 denn bei einer so gro\u00dfen Palette an Protagonisten w\u00e4re es wirklich schade gewesen, immer nur in den Kopf eines einzigen schauen zu d\u00fcrfen. Dadurch blieben die Figuren auch nicht nur oberfl\u00e4chlich, sondern gewannen an Tiefe, was gerade bei der Vielzahl an Figuren half, den einen vom anderen unterscheiden zu k\u00f6nnen und nicht den Faden zu verlieren. Besondere Erw\u00e4hnung verdient an dieser Stelle auch die Tatsache, dass jeder der Charaktere unglaublich individuell und authentisch war und stets nachvollziehbar handelte. Speziell war auch der Aufbau des Buches: Eingeteilt in zw\u00f6lf Teile und diese auch nochmal unterteilt in mehrere Abschnitte, waren diese zu Beginn des Buches noch unfassbar lang (allein der erste Teil dehnt sich \u00fcber fast 500 Seiten aus) und nahmen dann von Teil zu Teil immer mehr an L\u00e4nge ab (- mathematisch gesehen verk\u00fcrzte sich die Seitenzahl von Teil zu Teil immer um die H\u00e4lfte). Zu Anfang eines jeden Kapitels wurde au\u00dferdem kursiv kurz darauf hingewiesen, worum es im jeweiligen Kapitel gehen w\u00fcrde \u2013 war diese Anmerkung zu Beginn immer sehr knapp, wurde sie in den letzten Teilen sogar l\u00e4nger als das eigentliche Kapitel. Gerade die letzten Teile und Kapitel wirkten durch ihre K\u00fcrze sehr abgehetzt und hektisch, vieles wurde nur noch angedeutet, ergab sich aber stets aus den Ausf\u00fchrungen aus den vorangegangenen Teilen, sodass der Leser nicht mit Fragezeichen zur\u00fcckgelassen wurde. Ganz sicher bin ich mir nicht, ob ich die astronomischen Aspekte verstanden habe. Es hat dem Verst\u00e4ndnis der Geschichte keinen Abbruch getan, aber ich w\u00fcnschte trotzdem, ich w\u00e4re schlauer aus den Kreisdiagrammen zu Beginn des jeweiligen Teiles und auch aus den \u00dcberschriften der Kapitel \u2013 \u201cMerkur im Sch\u00fctzen\u201d beispielsweise \u2013 geworden. \u201cDie Gestirne\u201d ist ein au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches und komplexes Buch, das mit einer fesselnden Geschichte und einem noch fesselnderem Schreibstil aufwartet und das einen mit interessanten Charakteren und noch interessanteren Handlungsstr\u00e4ngen in seinen Bann zieht. Dieses Buch ist Krimi und historischer Roman in einem und wirkte auf mich unfassbar authentisch. Die 1040 Seiten wirken anfangs zwar bedrohlich \u2013 zum Schluss h\u00e4tte ich mir aber gerne sogar noch mehr Seiten gew\u00fcnscht, weil ich mich aus dem Neuseeland des 19. Jahrhunderts und den von Eleanor Catton geschaffenenen Figuren einfach nicht verabschieden wollte. Trotz allem war mir das Ende, das zwar keine Fragen offen lie\u00df, aber trotzdem einfach so hastig und \u00fcbereilt war und nicht einmal mehr einen kleinen Ausblick auf das zuk\u00fcnftige Schicksal der Charaktere gew\u00e4hrte, einfach ein zu abruptes, weswegen das Buch von mir 4.5 von 5 Sternen und eine gro\u00dfe Leseempfehlung bekommt! ...more
