THIS DARNED GREAT BOOK MADE ME STAY UP SO LATE! ____________ Okay! So it's the 27th now, and I'm ready to write my review. The first thing that should be apparent is that I loved this book. I gave it 5/5 stars, and it kept me up into the ridiculous hours of the night on both of the days that I read it. I recommend it to all! Now, let's break it up. Firstly, plot. One of the main reasons I loved this book was because it was constantly exciting. The plot kept up at a great pace and it NEVER lulled. I never found myself thinking \"I wish this would speed up!\" Obviously,<---M> because this is the first book</---M>, there is a fair bit of information dropping to set up the whole world concept, but the author did this in entertaining ways by weaving it into conversations and other moments. Also, the whole concept of this world is so cool that I didn't mind slowing down for a while to know more about it! Plot gets top marks for constantly keeping me intrigued! Also, I need to add, that this book was at times HILARIOUS. Like, I have honestly not laughed out loud at a book for what feels like a year and this book had me bursting out at laughter, with tears in my eyes, like five times! Secondly, characters. I love characters in books. They are the vessel through which the plot and world impact us. You can have a fantastic world but terrible characters and the book will be ruined. I was so lucky in this book that not only did I have a thrilling plot, but I also sad home of the best characters I've read in a while! One of the reasons that I don't like supernatural books, and this does have some supernaturalish aspects, is because the characters are usually so fake. They are in the world for maybe 2 days and BAM! They totally get it, fear nothing, understand all. Not here though! The main character grows up around this world, but she's never really in the know about it. And when she IS thrust into it she reacts in exactly the same way I would actually believe a person to act! She's scared, and frustrated, and excited! She acts kind of \"dorky\" about it, because it's so new to her! I thought it was so refreshing to have a character that admits that she doesn't understand her surroundings but that she's willing to give it a shot! She also had some really great moments where she took chances and was brave, and I really liked it. The other characters, although less developed, were also great. Her mother has a big role, which I love in YA novels because parents do exist! She also has a best friend who I really really loved. She isn't in on this time travelling world, but helps the main character as much as she can! They spend a lot of time looking things up on Google which I truly appreciated (how many times has a character in a book been confused and you know it could all be solved if they just went to the internet?!) and she's supportive, like telling Gwenyth to tell her mom about her situation and making sure that Gwenyth is okay. Overall, characters were fantastic! Finally, I want to talk about theme. Because honestly, there wasn't one. I think themes and lessons are important in books, and a lot of the time, if they aren't there, I don't want to give a book 5/5 stars because it's missing such an important aspect. However, in this book, it just didn't need it. There are obviously some small ideas, being brave and taking chances, but that was okay. I enjoyed this book for the thrill ride that it was! It was an honest, exciting, fun book that kept me up until way past when I should have been asleep. Translation Note: This is the first book I've read where I knew that it was translated. (I have probably read other books that are translated but I didn't know that while reading!) While I was reading I kept it in the back of my mind, but honestly, I didn't really notice anything! There were a couple times, admittedly, where some words were a bit too highbrow to seem natural, as if I doubted that the author had actually chosen THAT stuffy word and that the translator had not been able to find an easier translation and had had to use the \"proper\" word. Like, there was a moment when someone asked something mundane and the person answered \"My day was outstanding!\" .. it just didn't feel natural. However, this only happened like four times and it was never distracting or unsettling. It was just a thing. I LIKED THIS BOOK. IT WAS GREAT. I RECOMMEND YOU PICK IT UP! I'll be getting my hands on the second book, Sapphire Blue, as soon as possible, and I hope it lives up to <+++>Ruby Red</+++>! ...more DNF - 25% Consider checking out Tatiana's review before reading this book, as I should have done.

Gwen is such a charming and funny character, her voice and personality were great! The time travel aspect was well thought out, and I'm really liking how the main mystery is developing.

(Update: underrated in America. Europe knows what's up) . It's a pretty unique time traveling plot that almost reads like middle grade at times, but the story is fun enough that that doesn't ruin anything. It starts out in modern times with Gwyneth watching her cousin train to be a time traveler. One person in each generation in their large family is born with the ability to travel back in time (they can't control it -- they just suddenly vanish) and everyone assumes it's the cousin. But obviously it's the main character... who just suddenly vanishes and has to cope without all of the history lessons and training in etiquette, fencing, etc. She's able to travel back for short periods of time and then returns to the present. Suddenly Gwyneth is swept up into the institute of \"guardians\" who were previously training the cousin for their plots. They put Gwyneth's blood in a chronograph device that allows her to coordinate where she ends up when she travels back in time, except... there's a second missing chronograph, two missing time travelers from previous generations, and a whole lot of people with conflicting plans. The guardians want to get the blood from each of the time-travelers registered into the chronograph so they can find out some prophecy and plan creepy plans. Gwyneth is way out of her league as bits of truth come out and she has to figure out who to trust and who to stop. Gideon De Villers, the guy from the second time traveling family who was originally training for a mission with the cousin, now needs to grudgingly train with Gwyneth and a slow burn romance starts there. It's mostly just tension in this book, though. The plot in this first story could flow better, but a lot more information comes in in the sequels! It definitely gets better as it goes. There are a lot of conspiracies that weave throughout hundreds of years, plots and traitors, ghosts, plot twists, and a pretty awesome historical setting! Gwyneth's character is definitely aimed at younger crowds - she's 17 but sounds like she's in middle school at most. But this book was originally written in German, so the translation actually works pretty well overall. It's a fast read that leads right into the sequels and I would totally recommend it to middle/high schoolers or anyone who can handle some \"younger\" characters & humor. ...more I had so much fun reading this book. I love the narrator! I just posted my booktalk/discussion: http://youtu.be/b5bTqUrWG2I =D I knew Ruby Red wouldn't be quite my type of YA lit after reading first couple of pages of it. Even though the main character, Gwyneth, is 16 going on 17, she sounds about 12. Naturally, a quick decision-maker that I am, I made up my mind to drop it right after finishing chapter 1.

After finishing chapter 1 I decided to drop it after chapter 2, and so it went... Gwyneth is a member of the family of time-travelers. Every other generation or so her family produces a girl who starts uncontrollably travel into the past and back for short stretches of time at around the age of 16. This generation everyone thinks Gwen's cousin Charlotte is destined to be the next time-traveler. Only they are mistaken and it is Gwyneth who suddenly finds herself in the past. A lot of drama ensues and the girl is thrown into a web of old secrets and conspiracies that up to that point have been hidden from her. Considering the fact it only took me about 4 hours to read Ruby Red in its entirety, it's safe to say it is a reasonably entertaining and fast-paced novel. The plot is moderately original and well organized, although it is obvious that this trilogy is of a kind whose books don't really have self-contained story arcs but rather are parts of one big story. So don't expect a satisfying temporary conclusion here. I am not sure this series has an appeal to adults, like some middle-grade books do. The conflicts and relationships are fairly juvenile. The concept of time-travel is oversimplified and won't stand up to scrutiny by an adult mind - the real affect of time-travel and and constant contact of people from different eras on the future is never addressed. But for a younger crowd it's not a bad reading choice. Ruby Red offers a nice mix of PG-rated adventure, mystery, romance and cursory historical details, but nothing more. Tween girls will love the packaging too. Even my ARC is super-pretty, red and bejeweled. ...more \u201cIf we were in a film, the villain would turn out to be the least-expected person.

It took me a while to get used to the reader's posh British accent but eventually I really got into it! The story is centered in England so it was kind of fitting anyway. First of all, I loved the whole time traveling idea and it was thought out beautifully! I've never read a book about time travel before, and I loved that it wasn't scientifical but just something that occurs in Gwyneth's family when some chosen people reach a certain age. All the events happening in this book were really exciting, from Gwyneth discovering it's her possessing the time travel gene and not her cousin Charlotte, to all the funny and sometimes scary situations she encounters during her expected and sometimes unexpected time travels, to Gwyneth seeing dead people's ghosts... Everything had me yearning for more and I wonder how it all connects! What I didn't like however, were practically all the major characters. The side characters, like Leslie, James, Gwyneth's mom, Lucy, Paul, and even Charlotte, were all pretty interesting and likeable. They were all unique and a big part of what made this story so good. But oh dear gods , I didn't like Gwyneth and Gideon at all! Gwyneth acted like a scared, whiny and clueless little girl most of the time, which annoyed me to death! I sincerely hope she'll grow some backbone soon. Gideon however is just a bossy, cocky prick and I don't trust him one bit ! I really hope to see some major character development in the next books. All in all, I liked it but I didn't love it. I'm going to listen to the next two audiobooks anyway though! They really can't leave me hanging like this after ending Ruby Red with a kissing scene, ugh! I'd love to read more aboud Gwyneth's supposed magic as well. ...more Sometimes I really wonder what young adults see in certain young adult books. This series has pretty good ratings but I just don't see it. I was so bored for the first eighty percent of the book. I felt as if I had no idea who this heroine really was.

Since each year makes a big difference when it comes to teens, not knowing if she was twelve or seventeen was weird. So much o Sometimes I really wonder what young adults see in certain young adult books. This series has pretty good ratings but I just don't see it. I was so bored for the first eighty percent of the book. I felt as if I had no idea who this heroine really was. I don't even think it says how old she is until late in the book, which left me feeling a little off about her character. Since each year makes a big difference when it comes to teens, not knowing if she was twelve or seventeen was weird. So much of the story was a bunch of old English people sitting around talking to each other. The story of the guardians and the time travelers is so full of plot holes, and so many questions that I have aren't even alluded to. Or if they are answered, it's basically with a big ole question mark. As if the author didn't really know how to explain why there is an apparent \"time travel\" gene. She just allows the characters to say \"Well, we're not really sure.\" Why one male, one female? No clue. It just is. What's the point of the time traveling if it's only for a few minutes to a couple of hours? It seems so pointless. There's no fantasy here, just an odd, secretive political intrigue about a secret society of once-a-generation time travelers who go back into time to...what, talk to other time travelers? I just don't see the point. They're not doing anything meaningful, just hopping back and forth and arguing about it. I may continue the series if I get a wild hair all of a sudden. The last twenty percent was actually fairly fast paced and interesting, finally. The romance peeks out for half a second, there's some blood and guns and swords and chasing. And then it ends extremely abruptly. So abruptly, in fact, that I thought that my audiobook had failed to finish transferring to my phone. I actually went and checked the library's website and my Overdrive account to see if the entire last part downloaded. It was weird. And frustrating. ...more Before I delve into this review I first want to point something out - I should NEVER have picked up this book. Why you may ask? Well, because this does not even remotely sound like a book I would enjoy. The blurb alone would be evidence enough of that, two particular sentences stand out the most: \"can spend her time hanging out with her best friend, Lesley, watching movies and talking about boys.\" Oh and it gets worse... \"He's obnoxious, a know-it-all, and possibly the best-looking guy she's seen i Before I delve into this review I first want to point something out - I should NEVER have picked up this book. Why you may ask? Well, because this does not even remotely sound like a book I would enjoy. The blurb alone would be evidence enough of that, two particular sentences stand out the most: \"can spend her time hanging out with her best friend, Lesley, watching movies and talking about boys.\" Oh and it gets worse... \"He's obnoxious, a know-it-all, and possibly the best-looking guy she's seen in any century...\" So, from this blurb you can easily gather that the romance is going to pretty central to the plot and if you have to happen to like that, that is great and you may well just enjoy this book. I, however, HATE plot lines driven by romance so I should have known better than to read this book, but guess what?...I didn't even read the synopsis. I purely bought this book due to all the hype surrounding it, something I did quite a lot when I described the book blogging/booktubing communities. So that is just pretty much just a disclaimer to say that while I had strong feeling of dislike towards this book it is not because the book promised to be something more, I was just too silly to read the synopsis and know not to read it. Now, onto the less than glowing review. One of the worst things about this book, for me, was how it read. Words and sentences did not flow together like they should, their were several typos in the first page alone and it felt like I was reading a book aimed at children rather than young adults in the sheer simplicity of the language. Now, don't get me wrong sometimes simple language is a great deal better than the convoluted overly metaphorical language used by some authors but this was too simplistic. Now I feel a bit harsh commenting on the writing style and language as this is a translated book, so do bear that in mind if you plan on reading it. It was not only the writing style that appeared to be aimed more towards pre-teens but the plot as well. The protagonist of the story Gwen was supposed to be a sixteen year old girl, but read more as a twelve year old. For example her discussion of \"kissing boys\"... \"Kissing, said Lesley, ought really to be taught as a school subject...We often discussed what the ideal kiss would be like, and there were any number of films we'd watched over and over again just because of the good kissing scenes in them.\" A twelve year old talking like that...okay fair enough but SIXTEEN...no. Not only is Gwen really immature but she also really dense. Okay harsh I know but she genuinely knows nothing, and can't even remember a password that she has heard like ten times, \"The password?\" Quark edit bisquitis. Or something like that. \"Qua redit nescitis.\" Well, i'd had it almost right.\" . There are plenty more incidents just like this that make Gwen out to be a total ditz. My favourite line of all had to be this, \"When we had come in, someone had risen from a chair at the desk , nodded to Mr. George, and left the room without a word. \"Was that man mute?\" I asked. It was the first thing that came into my head.\" Oh, but of course he is mute because what other explanation could there possibly be... Gwen's best friend isn't much better(again, more twelve than sixteen), she was the most flat and pointless character. She had no personality except to be the friend who googled everything and finds out loads of information and is soooo excited for her friend. Booooring. There was not one character in this story that I actually liked. Gideon was, of course, the most beautiful specimen to ever grace the earth and also a complete chauvinist along with every other male in the story. Every character was just so unoriginal - you had the crazy great aunt, the snobby aunt, the self-righteous cousin, the worried mother, the excited friend and the handsome love interest...need I say more. Aside from all of that, the most annoying thing about this book was the complete and utter lack of a plot line. I mean, nothing happened...NOTHING. After 100 pages in I thought, okay something is going to happen now...nope...200...nope...then towards the end something happens...just nothing exciting. I am not even going to discuss the romance... I want to finish on a positive note so I will say I liked the idea of time-travel... I will not be continuing this series for very obvious reasons... ...more I decided I was going to take some time to percolate my ideas for this book, but it's still up in the air what I exactly think.

Normal enough, but she comes from a family who can time-travel. Thankfully the gene bypassed her and was given to her perfect cousin Charlotte. Gwen can enjoy a normal life without all the drama that comes with having the \"special\" gene. Well can you tell what's gonna happen? Gosh darn it you got it! (I'm not usually this cynical really; I'm just kind of irritated about my feelings about the book). Gwen's got the gene instead and there is lots of mystery shrouded around why this is. Now with Gwen thrown into this whole new world she meets Gideon (who is a bit of distraction to Gwen, to her great dismay); together they have an important mission to accomplish but it's hard to tell who are the bad and good guys, and if they can even trust each other. The workings and the history behind the society is interesting. It reminds me of setups of other secret societies actually. What kind of bothered me was how Gwen has thoughts and says things like a twelve or thirteen year old which would have been fine if that was her age. Then when she meets Gideon and gets in deep with the time-traveling stuff she shifts, which was nice to see but kind of abrupt for me. Of course it has those cool scenes of how events clash the present, past and future. I\u2019ve always loved stuff like that, and that was in here. Even though I have my reservations about it, I know others will just eat this up. I hate when I'm indecisive about a book, but you need some books like that so you can appreciate the amazing ones. What I think is bothering me so much is that I did expect to love it and for it to be epic, and it had all the pieces but it wasn\u2019t quite there yet. *sigh* Anyhow, at the end it leaves you in mid-stride. There is no major piece of the puzzle solved but it tantalizes you mercilessly and I will read the sequel. No matter my confusion of what I think I have to know what happens. HAVE TO. ...more \u201cIf we were in a film, the villain would turn out to be the least-expected person.

However, she knows nothing. She wasn't prepared. Everyone was being discreet -and still is- about the whole thing until their efforts were proven wrong. Then, she meets Gideon. The gene carrier of the de Villiers family. He's interesting and very handsome true. But also arrogant and treat our heroine like she's a useless ordinary girl. And now they have a mission to accomplish together. But who should she trust when even her mother is not telling her everything? Minor spoilers ahead Let's see. First of all, time traveling and telling things about the future here and there should much more complicated. A single act can change the future (at least for the family) but not here. If they informed the count that the Gwyneth is the one who has the gene and not Charlotte and he recorded it in the Annals, that won't mean that they'll teach her instead of the other one? I could go on all day how they could change the future and how to prevent Lucy and Paul from accomplishing their goals. Nope, too many illogical things. And what's up with Gwyneth? She's way too immature for a 16 years old girl! Why couldn't I feel anything for Gedeon? I really hope I'll like him better in the next book. Even though he treated her like trash, she still adored admired him. Well, at least, it was enjoyable. I was going to give it 3 stars but then noticed that the flaws were too many. And they talk about logic for God's sake! Also her mother, she wants to protect her? She has to be more convincing! How can her daughter trust her if she keeps from her all the secrets? Too many messed up things. No, the whole family is messed up, truth be told. (view spoiler) [It was too obvious that she wasn't her daughter. If the whole family have red hair and she doesn't you always know that isn't their real child!!! I also thought that she's Lucy and Paul's daughter when they were that concerned. But I want to know the detailss!! (hide spoiler) ] ...more I can seriously not express my love for this book. Maybe a five star rating is a little bit too much but literally my mind is blown at this moment!! So incredible and fast paced!

Ich bin so begeistert von diesem Buch, dass ich es in weniger als 24 Stunden gelesen habe. (Das hei\u00dft schon etwas, oder? Schlie\u00dflich passiert das auch nicht bei jedem Buch.) Die Charaktere waren sympathisch, vielf\u00e4ltig und teilweise auch etwas unheimlich. Die Geschichte hat mir bisher sehr gut gefallen. Ich habe immer mit unseren Hauptprotagonisten mitgefiebert. Ich kann gar nicht so recht glauben, dass ich so lange gebraucht habe, um diese Trilogie zu beginnen. Ich freue mich schon auf den 2. Te Ich bin so begeistert von diesem Buch, dass ich es in weniger als 24 Stunden gelesen habe. (Das hei\u00dft schon etwas, oder? Schlie\u00dflich passiert das auch nicht bei jedem Buch.)

Pero no lo har\u00e1 sola,sino que la acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 el ante\u00faltimo viajero del tiempo que tambi\u00e9n posee el gen,una inteligencia incre\u00edble y sobretodo una personalidad muy arrogante. La historia me ha encantado de principio a fin . Apenas comenc\u00e9 a leerlo sent\u00ed que me iba a divertir mucho con esta historia y as\u00ed fue. Si bien no sabemos hasta el fondo quienes son estos viajeros del tiempo o los vigilantes y tampoco sobre los secretos que ocultan estas familias portadoras del gen de \"saltar en el tiempo\", tenemos bastante informaci\u00f3n para quedarnos conforme en el primer libro . Tengo que admitir que quiz\u00e1s se nota mucho que es un young adult, pero eso no evit\u00f3 que me gustara mucho. (S\u00ed,s\u00ed ya se que lo dije tres veces). Hay algunos young adult que se estancan en detalles absurdos y conflictos idiotas pero no sucede esto en Rub\u00ed . Todas las situaciones de las que somos testigos nos encantan, nos entretienen y hasta nos hacen reir. La historia es tan fluida que lo lees super r\u00e1pido, cuando te das cuenta te faltan menos de 100 hojas para terminarlo. La historia est\u00e1 narrada en 1\u00ba persona por Gwendolyn y tengo que admitir que la lectura es muy r\u00e1pida y entretenida. Son pocos cap\u00edtulos y cada uno te atrapa,lo que se te hace complicado detenerte ya que quer\u00e9s seguir leyendo y leyendo. La escritura es sencilla y me encant\u00f3 que se detallaran todas esas diferencias en los lugares/hechos/personas con respecto a las distintas \u00e9pocas. Disfrut\u00e9 mucho viajar en el tiempo con Gideon y Gwendolyn. Los personajes son excelentes . Gwendolyn me gust\u00f3 mucho. Aunque al principio dudaba de su personalidad entend\u00ed que, al fin y al cabo, es una adolescente que no esperaba nunca en su vida que pudiera ser una viajera del tiempo. Pero es que...no entiendo por qu\u00e9 tard\u00f3 tanto tiempo en contar su secreto. (Me puse tan hist\u00e9rica cuando no sab\u00eda si contarle lo que pasaba a su madre que casi grito m\u00e1s que Leslie). A\u00fan as\u00ed me pareci\u00f3 un personaje tan real y completo que me encari\u00f1\u00e9 con ella. Quiz\u00e1s le falta un poco m\u00e1s de fiereza pero se nota que no se deja manejar y que ella va a hacer lo que crea conveniente y nos sorprender\u00e1 en los siguientes libros. Gideon ... ( se vuelve tan complicado no extender mi lista de novios literarios ) Me encanta, me gust\u00f3 y me divirti\u00f3 pero lo que m\u00e1s me enamor\u00f3 fue su manera de proteger a Gwendolyn. A pesar de que comenzaron con el pie izquierdo se nota que algo pasa entre ellos. A\u00fan no sabemos mucho sobre \u00e9l, salvo la informaci\u00f3n que pudo investigar Leslie y las preguntas que le hizo Gwen pero aparte de eso solo sabemos que es un viajero del tiempo de pelo largo,con ojos verdes,una inteligencia incre\u00edble y una hermosura desbordante ( es que ya empiezo a fangirlear ). Los personajes secundarios me gustaron todos realmente me gustaron cada uno de ellos. Desde los hermanos de Gwendolyn hasta James su extra\u00f1o amigo . Pero no quiero entrar en detalles, le sacar\u00eda la magia a los futuros lectores.. Rub\u00ed es un libro que te sorprende. Desde el principio la historia se vuelve atractiva y a medida que sabemos m\u00e1s sobre esta ,m\u00e1s queremos continuar su lectura. Es un libro diferente y muy agradable que simplemente te transporta al interior de esta historia haciendote olvidar de lo que pasa en el exterior. Me qued\u00e9 tan encantada ,tan enamorada con este libro que ya voy a comenzar con Sapphire Blue porque si hay algo que logr\u00f3 este libro es que me ha dejado con mucha intriga. ...more Unpopular opinion time!

A bunch of my friends gave lovely reviews to this book but I saw Rachel had given it a one star and I was immediately apprehensive. We tend to have similar taste, especially with fantasy (and wedding dresses) or whatever the hell this was so I should have known better. I have never been so bored with a fantasy novel. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. Yes, we get that Gwyneth is is special and she has powers that her jealous and sort of horrible cousin was supposed to inherit but that's it. There's no danger here. There's nothing going on besides running around in the past in period appropriate clothes trying to catch the right timing. It's all a bit silly. Then there's this whole secret society thing where everybody in the world knows about time traveling but nobody knows what they actually do with these powers. I'm sorry, but people would be trying to infiltrate that shit and kill people off. There would be legitimate danger at some point. But besides one assassination attempt, they just frolic around in their corsets and top hats and ride in carriages. Also, Gwyneth makes a horror/action movie mistake when she tells her best friend everything about what is going on in this super secret society. I mean, come on. You are asking the girl to get killed, kidnapped, or something. Nothing ever good comes out of something like that, especially when ONE OF YOUR FUCKING TEACHERS IS IN THE SECRET SOCIETY. The love interest, Gideon, was rather stupid and shallow. Super judgmental and flip flops very quickly about what girl he likes. Does he like Charlotte? Only if she's a special snowflake which she isn't. As soon as Gwyneth is special, Gideon likes her. There's insta-love and a male lead that ended up irritating the hell out of me. He acts like he is top shit but gets over powered and out maneuvered on several occasions. So here it is. The Big Finish! The Rude Conclusion! Main female lead that is too stupid to live. Would have slapped her given the opportunity. Nothing actually happened throughout the book. Male lead is an idiot and shallow as hell too. ...more Gonna read this gonna read this hooray Stand: 2010 Warum das Buch eines der besten Jugendb\u00fccher ist und ihr es deshalb lesen solltet? 1.

Ich sag nur \"Elisabeth die erste war so krass h\u00e4sslich... \" Jaja, der gute Gordon Gelderman ist eben ein Ass, was Aufs\u00e4tze angeht... 2. SUCHTFAKTOR Buch eins und zwei hatte ich innerhalb von 30 Stunden durch. Man kann sich einfach nicht von der Geschichte losrei\u00dfen, wenn man einmal angefangen hat. Allerdings erscheinen einem die B\u00fccher leider auch l\u00e4nger als sie tats\u00e4chlich sind, weil es zwischen jedem Kapitel eine Kleinigkeit zu lesen gibt. Ein Zitat oder aber auch Ausz\u00fcge aus den \"Chroniken der W\u00e4chter\", die sehr viel Platz einnehmen und daf\u00fcr gesorgt haben, dass das Buch \u00fcberhaupt die 300 Seiten knackt. 3. Die Charaktere Sie sind einfach nur unheimlich gut ausgearbeitet, autentisch und sympathisch. Beispielsweise Leslie. Sie ist eine Art D\u00e4mpfer f\u00fcr Gwendolyns ab und an aufkommende Naivit\u00e4t und ihre Sichtweise auf Gwen war auch ganz angenehm. Normalerweise hat man ja immer die ganzen Selbstzweifel der jungen M\u00e4dchen in den Young Adult Romanen ohne dass mal jemand hingeht und sagt: M\u00e4dchen, rei\u00df dich zusammen! Leslie tut das hier aber regelm\u00e4\u00dfig, was so auch Gwen gleich viel sympathischer machte. Vor allem, da Gwens gr\u00f6\u00dfter Fehler eigentlich viel mehr ihre Verplantheit ist... Au\u00dferdem bin ich ein James-FAN! Oh, oh, OH und Tante Maddy! Wenn ich eine solche Tante h\u00e4tte... xD 4. Die Struktur Man merkt beim Lesen, dass Kerstin Gier alles fertig geplottet hatte bevor sie mit dem Schreiben begann. Es greift alles ineinander \u00fcber. Beispielsweise findet man im ersten Buch durch Gwens Zeitreisen eine Szene, die erst im dritten Buch richtig stattfinden wird. So war Kerstin Gier quasi dazu gezwungen ihre Geschichte gut zu durchdenken und das merkt man ihre auch an. 5. Die Lesern\u00e4he Obwohl sie jede Menge B\u00fccher geschrieben hat, nimmt Kerstin Gier sich trotzdem die Zeit, im Forum Leserfragen zu beantworten selbst wenn sie schon zum hundertsten Mal gestellt wurden... Daumen hoch daf\u00fcr! \u2665 FAZIT Humorvoll und mit viel Herz. Eine wirklich sch\u00f6ne und unterhaltsame Geschichte, die auf eine grandiose Art und Weise erz\u00e4hlt wurde.

I had a lot of fun reading this book, and it was the perfect read at the perfect time, since I am still emotionally scarred by Captive Prince . Ruby Red is what I would recommend if you're in a reading slump and trying to get out of it, if you are stressed and need something quick and funny to read or if, like me, you've just finished reading an emotionally challenging book.

Ruby Red is what I would recommend if you're in a reading slump and trying to get out of it, if you are stressed and need something quick and funny to read or if, like me, you've just finished reading an emotionally challenging book. At first I wasn't really fond of the writing, since it's extremely simplistic (but again, it's a translation. I usually try to avoid translated books, but there's no way I would be able to read an entire novel in German), but I also think it's somehow... appropriate. It feels exactly like being inside a teenager's head. Gwyneth is a sixteen-year-old girl from a family of time travelers, and she's wonderfully normal. She goes to school, has an amazing best friend, Lesley (who would deserve a paragraph of her own, because she is that amazing) and together they do the most ordinary things. They watch movies, make friends, sometimes crush on boys. It was so refreshing to have a normal girl as a main character - not an outsider, not a special snowflake who was oh-so-different from everybody else. Gwyneth is funny and sometimes endearingly awkward, and she always stands up for herself. I loved not only her relationship with Lesley (really, female friendships in books make me happy) but also the one she had with her family. She was very affectionate towards her younger siblings, and I adore books in which the main character has a large family and has to deal not only with their parents and siblings, but also with a spiteful aunt, an icy-cold grandmother and a know-it-all cousin. Gwyneth is not supposed to be special. She's supposed to live an ordinary life, leaving the spotlight to her cousin, Charlotte, who should be the one carrying the time travel gene (a pretty confusing theory, if you ask me; we're not given a lot of explanations. Though from now on I won't ever be able to read about Newton again without grinning and thinking about Gwyneth.) Instead, against all expectations, it's Gwyneth herself who is able to travel backwards in time. Now, for a time travel book, the actual time travel started to happen pretty late. I was expecting days-long journeys back to the 1800s, but Gwyneth never stays in the past for more than a couple of hours (though the few times she does go back in time, a lot of exciting things happen!) However, she may be the last time traveler, but she's not the only one. Gideon De Villiers is heir to an ancient family of time travelers, and Gwyneth's new companion. He's full of himself and often annoying - so, yes, of course I loved him. The thing about Gideon is that he's unexpectedly kind, and actually cares about Gwyneth, but also has his own goals. The two of them had the funniest banter, and I think he makes a great love interest. The book has a lot of other cool fantasy elements as well, like enigmatic visions of the future, a secret society of time travelers and, last but not least, ghosts. Gwyneth has been able to see ghosts, gargoyles, demons and all kinds of otherworldly creatures since she was a child, which was a very interesting detail about her. Long story short, Ruby Red is pure entertainment. The writing is a bit too simplistic and sometimes the book reads almost like a middle grade novel - I'm not sure if that's because of the writing itself or because Gwyneth is still a kid, after all - but I enjoyed it immensely. It's funny and fast-paced with wonderful characters, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. ...more My mind is literally blown at this moment.

Just run to the nearest store or library and start reading. First of all, Gwyneth is one of the most likable heroines ever. Yes, truly. Ever. She's hilarious, brave, clever, and absolutely endearing. She reminded me a lot of Sophie in the HEX HALL series but rather than a world of witches and demons, Gwyneth is in a world of time travelers and ghosts. And boy did I LOVE that world. Sure, it's modern day London--but not really. It's also the early 20th century, the late 18th century, and pretty much every-when in between. Everything about it felt like something just outside of time--and I loved that. And did I mention Gideon? Talk about swoon-worthy! Everything about his banter with Gwyneth was grin-inducing. OH, WHY ISN'T THE SEQUEL OUT YET? I NEED IT. Seriously, this ache in my chest will not be erased until I know what happens. Who's good? What do Gwyneth's new powers all mean? And what the heck will happen with her and Gideon?? Also, I wanted to say that I am downright amazed by the quality of this translation (done by Anthea Bell). It was flawless, and whatever tweaks she did to make it all transition between languages correctly, they were superb. ...more All in all, Gwen annoyed the shit out of me (she was idiotic), there are giant, gaping plot holes, and while I understand a lot of these will probably be answered in the other two books (it certainly feels like part one of a big story, instead of having its own seperate arc within a bigger picture), it just wasn't enough to be satisfying.

The mystery aspect of this was enough to keep my reading though so I think I will continue with the series, if only to get some answers! ...more Ya ben \u00e7ok sevdim bunu*-* A\u015f\u0131r\u0131 kolay okunan tatl\u0131\u015f, komik ve e\u011flenceli bi kitapt\u0131.
