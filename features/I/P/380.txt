Too ma I read an interview with CH saying she had started this book, got off an tangent, and realized she'd finished the book not just the tangent. This book has that feel... like it's really just 3 or 4 tangents and not a fully developed, interwoven novel. CH is an amazing author so I don't fault her. I chalk it up to this is the 8th book in a series of first person narrative that has gotten so complex with so many overlapping story-lines, it was bound to happen. This is, to me, a wrap-up book. Too many subplots have been left loose for too long. In order to move on to bigger and better things, these loose ends needed tying up. Loose End #1 aka the Were War My heart hurt every time a new Were died. It was HP7 all over again, but instead of Hedwig, Dobby, and Fred, it was Maria-Star, Christine Larrabee, and Amanda. Did CH realize she had far too many characters to for readers to keep up with, and some weeding needed to occur in order to introduce more characters? I\u2019m keeping that theory because it works so well for happens later on. I have mixed feelings about Alcide as the new pack leader, but Sookie seemed to think he\u2019d grown up a bit. Loss will do that to a person (<---B>Dad, girlfriends, packmates, etc</---B>). I was mildly disappointed Patrick Furnan was erased as a viable threat to Sookie so quickly and easily. A little deus ex machina, but whatever. This is a subplot I\u2019m only mildly interested in anymore. Loose End #2 aka the Vamp War GAH! I loved Sophie-Anne. I wanted her to go down in a blaze of glory, not an afterthought or just a package delivered safely by lawyers to be poorly defended by Andre the giant. Where was Mr. Cataliades throughout all this? Did he go down with queen? Or save his own ass when the getting was good? Hmmm\u2026 CH seems to want us to remember why Sookie should not be eloping with Quinn right this minute. All these sexual thoughts about the ever present Eric, and Bill being super sweet and available (good-bye Selah. No one will miss you or Portia). And Eric\u2019s memories magically returned? (Har har). More sudden fortune or absurdly good timing? I was completely in dire straits with Eric over the hostile takeover. LOVE that Pam. In light of finally meeting Felipe Castro, it seems like a good decision. I only say that b/c it all worked all well for Sookie. Loose End #3 aka What happened to Quinn? My heart completely jumped out of chest, ran down the road, and began kicking the shite out of this completely two-faced, blind main character who has lost all her good sense and ability to see the world clearly. She realizes she\u2019s being selfish by wanting to be someone\u2019s number #1, yet she tells Jason never to contact her again b/c of his selfishness? And who is this person who\u2019s been bemoaning her lack of family for 7 books now coming down on someone else, who also has very little family, needing to be there for them? She even thinks her reasoning is faulty when she chooses what to say to Frannie and Mrs. Quinn. Sookie used to be great at self-evaluation and changing her mind when she was wrong. What happened? She does not know that he would always choose them above her. In real life, they\u2019d compromise and make it work. She would be a huge help to him, and they would all be a big family. The Sookie of book 1 would know that. Sookie of book 8 has had too much vampire exposure and near-death experiences to understand ordinary life anymore. I\u2019ve always been on Sookie\u2019s side no matter what, her cheerleader through and through, but she\u2019s about lost me on this one. It\u2019s blind and stupid beyond belief. The only explanation that makes any sense to me is that happy, settled characters tend to end the series. Sookie can\u2019t be happy in a relationship or there\u2019d be nothing more to write about. She has to be conflicted and guy-hopping in order to maintain the sexual conflict of the books. Honestly, if CH wanted Quinn out of the picture, I would have preferred they get married and Bill/Eric kills him. That would have made more sense. My prediction: Sookie will realize her horrid mistake just in time for Quinn to die in her arms at a later date. She\u2019s too smart to let this stupidity go on forever, but it will cost her. On a brighter note, all this off stage action happening with Quinn has given me FABULOUS material for my Quinn perspective writings here and on MySpace. :) Loose End #4 aka Family business, to be continued. Hi Grandpa! How are you related to my sexually molesting uncle again? Oh how convenient Claudine and Claude are my cousins! Errrrr. Wonder if Niall knows about Hunter? That will be interesting. He might since Sookie pointed Remy out to him. I doubt Niall wouldn\u2019t investigate this person I\u2019m looking up for g-granddaughter. Hmm, I predict a flash flood coming for Remy and Kristine. Enemies of Niall again perhaps? Who\u2019ve I left out? Sam of course! Always discounted but coming in big to save the day in the Were war and playing a bit part in the Vamp war. I don\u2019t see the Sandra/Tanya angle being dismissed so easily. Sandra is a witch too, if I recall. Time for a little love spell for Sam? And all the attention to Dawson was a little odd; he\u2019s a little too similar a character to Quinn for me. And what\u2019s with every single time the man speaks, \u201cthat\u2019s practically a speech from Dawson.\u201d We get he\u2019s isn\u2019t loquacious! Good lord. Simon R. Green, get out of my Sookie books. All in all, this book packed a punch. I\u2019m uber disappointed in the resolution of Quinn\u2019s character. I don\u2019t think Eric or Bill or even Sam is good enough for Sookie. She likes the nookie, but she won\u2019t settle. Quinn was nigh on perfect and she turned it down. She\u2019s self-destructive. I\u2019ll give this to CH. MUST READ MORE!

A fistful of (largely) unrelated things happened all about the same time, pretty much willy nilly. The pile up of coincidences is too much for me. Also, Sookie is unusually cranky in this book. Okay, there's a lot of crap piling up on her head, but she's usually so sweet. However, all that said, CH is clearly setting up some really really interesting stuff for the next four or five books. I understand when series need these \"set up\" books -- it's hard to keep over-arching plots going four or five books ahead without taking a pause.

Maybe it's that Sookie's inner voice is starting to sound like that of Harper Connelly, the protagonist of Harris' other paranormal series, and that's not a good thing. Like Harper, Sookie seems detached, reacting to events without really feeling anything. The shallow writing style also makes it seem as if Sookie isn't very bright.

(Her Southern dialect is much more pronounced in this book. I remember smiling at the occasional Southern-style phrasing in the earlier books, but now it's really thick.) Maybe it's that every scene seems incomplete, and every conversation gets cut off before any real discussion takes place - especially any conversation with Bill or Eric, who drop in for 15-second sound bites and then disappear. It's very unsatisfying. The author includes a lot of mundane details about Sookie's life. She paints her toenails, goes grocery shopping, and cleans up at the bar. I like these kind of details, I really do, but this book isn't long enough to support them. It feels like the author has padded out a short story into a novel. And on a final whinging note, this book is a full-sized hardback, which means it doesn't match the rest of my set. ...more Book Eight, and Harris can\u2019t even get past the first line of the \u201cPreviously in this Series\u201d summary before annoying me with her inaccuracy and stupidity.

Britain i Book Eight, and Harris can\u2019t even get past the first line of the \u201cPreviously in this Series\u201d summary before annoying me with her inaccuracy and stupidity. She begins: \u201cIf this was The Lord of the Rings and I had a smart British voice like Cate Blanchett, I could tell you the background of the events of that fall in a really suspenseful way.\u201d This annoys me for three reasons: 1.\t Cate Blanchett doesn\u2019t have a British voice. She is Australian. 2.\tThere is no such thing as a British accent. Britain is made up of 3 countries (More if she means the British Isles). Each of these countries has many different accents associated with them. The fact that Sookie either negates Wales and Scotland or conflates them with England is racially and socially ignorant. The fact that she imagines that everyone (or indeed anyone) in England speaks like Galadriel in Lord of the Rings is ridiculous. 3.\tSpeaking with any of the accents originating from Britain does not make you automatically sound smart. Not unless the person listening to you is as much of an irredeemable idiot as <---C>Sookie Stackhouse</---C>. With a beginning this bad, the chances that Harris had suddenly developed some writing talent, or that Sookie had become a less appalling character, were slim. And indeed, this is yet another terrible book to add to the Stackhouse mound. It commences in possibly the most boring way possible, with a long and details description of a wedding. Apparently it\u2019s an Episcopalian wedding, but since I am nowhere near as interested in Christian denominations as Harris\u2019 assumes, I have no idea what this means or why I should care. At any rate, said wedding is massively dull. It does however give Sookie a chance to re-describe every character in the series once again, including the compulsory mention of Sam\u2019s \u201chalo of strawberry blond hair\u201d , which she has somewhat of an obsession with. She also has another opportunity to display herself as the woman-hating bitch she is, when her ex-boyfriend Bill makes some tacky gesticulation in her direction to indicate that she is still in his heart, or some such mush. This she finds very romantic, despite the fact that his current girlfriend, Selah is sat next to him at the time. Selah\u2019s feelings on the matter go unrecorded. A few pages later Bill creeps up on Sookie whilst she is getting undressed and declares that he would love to sleep with her again. She is mildly annoyed at this voyeurism, but since being called fuckable is the greatest compliment possible for Sookie, she forgives him. To be fair, by this point Sookie has been repeatedly sexually harassed by all her soon-to-be-, current and ex-boyfriends to a point where this sort of incident must seem rather minor to her. She seems much more annoyed at Selah\u2019s temerity in asking her about this episode than she does the matter itself, and certainly neither shows her any sympathy or evinces any interest in her situation. This is because Sookie has absolutely no fellow-feeling with women whatsoever and the only emotion they inspire in her is jealousy. Sookie\u2019s problems with other women, prominent throughout all the books in this series, reach a previously unmanaged level of vileness in this volume. During a meeting with her previously absent great-grandfather Sookie is led to give a slight amount of thought (which is the most she can manage in any case) to her most recent ancestors. She recalls some problems in her relationship with her mother, adds this to the new information that her father was \u00bc fairy, and concludes that obviously her relationship with her mother, who died when Sookie was seven, was strained because her mother was obsessed with her husband, Sookie\u2019s father, and thus felt sexual jealousy toward her young daughter regarding him. Personally I would have at least considered the fact that Sookie\u2019s mother would have been coping with a child who exhibited unexplained supernatural powers, which could have contributed to her difficulty dealing with her daughter. But not Sookie. Sookie\u2019s mother didn\u2019t adore her. Sookie\u2019s mother was a woman. Ergo, Sookie\u2019s mother was a bitch who was jealous of Sookie QED. If this damning indictment of her own mother and females in general wasn\u2019t enough, Sookie, learning of her grandmother having born children to a man other than her husband, then proceeds to make one of the most disgusting statements I have ever had the misfortune to read: \u201cHe raped her,\u201d I said, almost hoping it was so. My grandmother had been the most true\u2010blue woman I\u2019d ever met. I couldn\u2019t picture her cheating anyone out of anything, particularly since she\u2019d promised in front of God to be faithful to my grandfather. Apparently Sookie would rather think that her beloved grandmother, the woman who raised her and cared for her before being brutally murdered, was raped on at least two occasions and almost certainly more over a period of several years, rather than have her morality offended by the thought of her grandmother committing an infidelity. This is what passes for Christian sensibility in Sookie\u2019s neck of the woods. This is not the first time by any means that Harris has made light of rape, but previously I was able to temper my repulsion somewhat with the hope that she spoke in ignorance alone. However in light of these remarks I am forced to assume that she is in fact a contemptible, narrow-minded, judgemental bitch. There\u2019s certainly plenty of corroborating evidence for this assumption in each and every one of these awful books. After discussing such a serious and offensive matter my usual glib criticism seems rather shallow. But since Harris has worked so hard to earn my animosity so fully, I shall continue with the denigration she so richly deserves. The plot seems even weaker than usual, although perhaps that\u2019s only due to it beginning to wear out through overuse. Once again Sookie is harassed, sexually and generally, by a variety of characters. The plot combines the mystery of her missing boyfriend, which goes nowhere, with the mystery of yet another random spate of werewolf attacks, which meanders through the first half of the book in constant danger of petering out. These plots eventually lead to yet another supernatural battle or incredible dullness. Meanwhile we hear a lot more about Sookie\u2019s prowess at cleaning houses and her more limited culinary abilities, which is obviously fascinating. There\u2019s also a spate of boyfriends and ex-boyfriends letting themselves into Sookie\u2019s bedroom, often whilst she\u2019s asleep. For some reason she\u2019s not even slightly perturbed by this obsessive stalker behaviour. In other random events, Sookie confesses to murder several times to random friends and acquaintances, all of whom are similarly unperturbed, and the parents of Sookie\u2019s murder victim suddenly turn out to have died together in a car accident, thereby allowing a boring plot from several books back to proceed. This is partially resolved when Sookie deals with a woman with whom she has a slight disagreement by having said woman\u2019s current boyfriend (an ex love-interest of Sookie) kidnap her, and helping two witches to erase her mind of all thoughts that Sookie doesn\u2019t like. This seems like the actions of a crazy, self-obsessed bitch to me, but as none of the characters other than the girl herself share my view the mind and character alteration proceeds. After this Sookie participates in catching her brother\u2019s pregnant girlfriend cheating on him. Meanwhile Sookie\u2019s flatmate has a brief lesbian relationship with Pam the vampire before deciding \u201cPam and I are more buddies than honeys\u201d as soon as a man shows a sexual interest in her; this homophobic dismissal oddly earns her no apparent animosity from Pam, although it does save Harris from having to describe anything other than a heterosexual relationship. Then there is a random vampire-related attack which makes very little sense. Finally, Sookie decides to visit her long-lost nephew for some reason. This accomplished, the book ends. None of the various plot-strands are tied together, or at any point rendered interesting.

The worst part, if I can possibly isolate an individual element from the overall horror, is the coy little stammer as Sookie can\u2019t bring herself to say a rude word. Stupidest Death Sookie is attacked two or three times a book by ciphers, in a vain attempt to add some tension to the plot. After these attacks Harris routinely disposes of the attackers in a variety of contrived ways in order to avoid straining herself by having to create any more characters or provide them with any motivation. The methods of dispatch are usually any that absolve Sookie from moral blame, such as death by a nearby supernatural or death by accidentally throwing themselves on a stake Sookie is holding. However this book features a particularly poor effort. Sookie and an innocent bystander are attacked in a library. Sookie throws a book at the threatening assailant, trips him up, and he promptly accidentally falls on his own knife and dies instantaneously. Now, I\u2019m not expecting a great deal of medical accuracy in these books, but I would like to know what type of wound Harris thinks an adult male is likely receive from falling on his own knife that would kill him so rapidly. I\u2019m beginning to think \u201cattacking Sookie Stackhouse\u201d is a valid cause of death in Bon Temps.

I understand that Harris likes to point out how brilliant the USA is at least once a book, but this doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Most citizens of monarchies are not \u201cused to bowing\u201d, as they usually don\u2019t meet said monarch on a day to day basis. I myself have the misfortune to be a citizen of a country which still ascribes to the outdated notion of a monarchy, and I resent the assumption that because I wasn\u2019t born in the \u201cLand of the Free\u201d I must be used to servility and self-humiliating gestures.

But whatever the details I feel one very salient point is being ignored. Sam is a shifter. He can shift into any animal he likes. So surely he would shift into a mouse and crawl out of his bonds, or a mountain bear and tear them apart, or something of the sort? No. He just stands there until Sookie saves him, doing absolutely nothing. Eventually the series of random events masquerading as a novel simply stops, without conclusion or cliff-hanger. I presume Harris simply got bored. So did I. Sadly, somewhat earlier than she did. ...more <+++>From Dead to Worse</+++> is the eighth Sookie Stackhouse book and, after reading it, definitely a comfort Sookie for me.

Right up there with numbers four and five-- Dead to the World and Dead as a Doornail . And, yes, I realize that my favorite Sookie books are also the ones with a high Eric factor. That's just the way it is. Fortunately, Ms. Harris seems to be channeling the good Eric vibes as well, because I continue to like where his and Sookie's relationship is going. And I like that it's not speeding but taking its time. Although, I will put in a request for \"that conversation\" to happen in the next book, please thank you. This installment sees Sookie and company recovering from the repercussions of the disastrous vampire summit in the last book. Post-Hurricane Katrina Louisiana is also still recovering and several new people come into Sookie's life as a result of this necessary shifting around of their state and their lives. This story seemed very real to me. The trademark humor is still there and as charming as ever. But Sookie makes several weighty decisions throughout the course of this book. Forces herself to, in some cases. And where a few new characters come in, a few older ones make what I would term exits. Wisely chosen ones, I thought. Sam maintains a quiet but firm presence in Sookie's life. Bill determinedly lingers around the edges. And, even though I will always despise him, he did remind me (and Sookie) of a few of the reasons they got together in the first book. And Eric and Sookie continue to navigate the deep waters between them (their increasingly powerful blood bond, that pesky long-term amnesia thing Eric's got going on, etc). I enjoyed this installment because it was low key, but carried simmering consequences and intriguing possible developments under its calm-ish surface. Sookie was superb. Extremely mature, unafraid, and determined. In all the best ways. Another hit for Charlaine Harris . Can't wait for book nine. ...more From Dead to Worse is the eighth book in Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series.

This book seemed like somewhat of a transition. After the huge events of the last book and the vampire summit, this book seemed to take a breath and recover a bit. The cast of characters expands as Sookie meets a relative (or two) that she didn't know she had, and we're also introduced to some witches as Sookie's group of supernatural friends grows. And as always, Sookie's romantic interests are a source of tension in the book as she tries to work out who and what's right for her - shifter, weretiger or vampire. It also contracts a bit as some characters were written out or killed off. No spoilers here, but it did seem a bit like Harris was wrapping up some loose ends so the story/series can move on. Alan Ball has created a series based on these novels for HBO... and after reading this latest addition to the series I'm back on board (I wasn't so sure after the last one) and looking forward to the show and the next book. ...more 4.5 stars From Dead to Worse is the eighth full-length novel in the Sookie Stackhouse series by popular American author, Charlaine Harris.

She also finds herself in the middle of a hostile takeover of the Louisiana vampires, a takeover that results in several of her vampire friends permanently dead. Spells are cast, a killer exposed and a fledgling relationship ends. Sookie breaks a finger (but not one of hers), does a bit of mediating and saves quite a few lives. There are several attempts on her life by the end of this instalment, so Sookie is surprised and rather satisfied to find herself now under the protection of three powerful individuals. And after her brother Jason\u2019s disappointing behaviour, Sookie is pleased to learn she has two more living relatives of whom she was unaware. Questions remain unanswered so there\u2019s plenty to be going on with in the next book, Dead and Gone, but the last few pages will warm the heart of the most cynical reader. Another entertaining read. ...more Flufftastic. The Sookie soap opera rolls along in yet another installment. Life in Bon Temps, Louisiana, is never dull.

On the friend front, Sookie gains another female roommate who has potential to be a friend as well as a witchy helper. Yay for women friends! There\u2019s a lot of conflict in the book, as there are upsets in both the Were and Vampire worlds that Sookie must adjust to. She, of course, ends up in the middle of both of them, but at least not grieviously injured in either. In fact, she proves once again to be more street-smart than her vampire friends on at least one occasion. We also learn more about Sookie\u2019s genealogy and about fairy lore in the Sookie universe (which I am glad to report is not all flowers and unicorns). When questioned by Sam about whether she would like her quiet \u201cbefore\u201d existence back, Sookie declares that all the trouble that she has been through has been worth it for the shake-up of her previous boring existence. The writing is still not the best quality, but the story line is fun and pulled me along in the best serial-adventure style. The series is getting a bit convoluted and somewhat tired, but I\u2019m still enjoying them. ...more Rating: 3.75* of five The Publisher Says : After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing.

And when the fur has finished flying and the cold blood finished flowing, her world will be forever altered. My Review : After being sorely, sorely disappointed in book 7 of the series, All Together Dead , this was a refreshing, unsaggy unbaggy pointed read. It feels so good to be in Bon Temps again, and to have Sookie acting in her accustomed tartly self-possessed way. She's facing huge changes to the supernatural universe, of course, after the events of the last book, but she's doing so with a sense of purpose...which is what the last book lacked. Among my most favoritest moments of all time in the series is the un-catting of Bob. 'Nuf sed. Felipe de Castro, the new King of Louisiana, is memorably vile, and leaves you eager to see how Eric and Sookie will cope with his bland, banal evilness. His catspaw Victor Madden...well, nothing too bad can happen to someone like that, undead or not. But the shocker of this book, the big baddie, is so horrible that I was compelled to put the book down and breathe deeply for a minute or two. Just, well, it's as bad as anything in the series. For sure and certain. Better than I'd ever thought to hope, after last outing.

Overall, the plot is wobbly and far from air-tight. Both the weres and the vampires are involved in bloody struggles for power, but each conflict fizzles, with little build or climax. This book is mostly about wrapping up old plot threads. ...more Find this review, plus more, on my blog: Booklikes OR Blogger Basic Info Format: Kindle Pages/Length: n/a Genre: Vampire; Werewolves; Magic; Fantasy Reason For Reading: Continue series At A Glance Love Triangle/Insta Love/Obsession?: All.

Meh. ...more Longer than the last couple of books, better in some ways, it had multiple story lines. Sookie generally has one major issue to work through, this time she had half a dozen or so & it made the book feel a bit unfocused. Not bad & I'm glad I read it. It's fun, fluffy candy reading - very relaxing & enjoyable. It should certainly be read in order with the rest of the series.

A fine addition to the Sookie Stackhouse books, Dead to Worse sees Sookie dealing with the continuing aftermath of the debacle in New Orleans. Her boyfriend is still missing, the witch she picked up as a roommate is still complicating her life, her real grandfather wants to talk to her and all of Louisiana's supernatural communities are reeling from the devastation brought by hurricane Katrina. In Poppy Z. Brite 's parlance, this is a \"post-K\" book, the sort every Louisina author (or author setting material in Louisiana) has to deal with. The overall mood is devastation and the themes are change and uncertainty. The physical, social, and economic restructuring from Katrina is mirrored in the supernatural community as well as in the personal lives of the major characters. The book is roughly split in two sections: the first deals with the Shreveport werewolves and the second with the vampire hierarchy. Both power structures are up for grabs with the current power holders weakened by the results of the previous two books. Both call on Sookie as a stabilizing influence, whether she wants it or not. The contrast, or lack of contrast, is interesting. The werewolf conflict is bloody and short. It begins with random-seeming murders and Sookie steps in (in a quintessentially Sookie moment: calling the pack leader and asking, \"why are you trying to have me killed?\") and plays mediator. Well, she plays lie-detector. As a result, the occasional murders turn into a full-fledged war with fur and death all around. And both sides of the pack hierarchy thank her for it. The vampire conflict seems more civil at the start, with an established order to maintain and a structure for negotiations and agreements, but in the end it is at least as brutal. Sookie provides the framework for the solution, but the vampires themselves have to solve it. In each case, there is an outside agitator element and the locals have to decide, regardless of their local relationships, whether they are loyal to their friends, their community, or themselves. In particular, Eric has to choose between his queen, his position, his club (and staff), and his pride. Another recurring element of the book is Sookie standing up and doing something hard. She hasn't been good at that in previous books and it's nice to see that the events and growth of the last year or so are taking hold. Not really something developed in Worse but we're shown how it affects her. Not a huge amount of character growth or any expansion of the world--although the ongoing \"will the shapeshifters come out of the closet\" question gets some discussion--but a nice breather to let the changes in the world and characters settle in. A fun one-sitting read and a fine addition to the series. ...more So I liked this book, but I also disliked this book. I think this is the most confused I've been about a book ever.

Sookie is getting a backbone, which is good, and during her whole talk with Quinn, I was screaming \"You go girl!\" because face it everyone wants to be someone's only one. I mean he should have called her after leaving the hospital to say \"Hey, my mom's gone crazy so I got to go save her. I'll be in touch. Love you. Smooches.\" That's all he had to say to her, but did he? No. Stupid boy. But the reason I didn't like this book is that there is no central plot other than Sookie figuring out that life is complicated and people are complicated. Nobody fits in a perfect \"best friend\" box or a perfect \"boyfriend material\" box. Also, is it me or does she have way too many guys sniffing up her skirt? I mean seriously that does not happen in real life. Especially them all being major hotties. But yeah, (sigh) Eric getting his memory back. Me = big Eric fan. But also I am a big Sam fan. She just needs to push everyone away and give Sam a chance or she'll be mad at herself later. And all this \"Sam would be happy with her because they can run under the moon together\" bullshit needs to stop. If that was a big deal to him, he would not be slyly courting her as he is. I really like how her family situation is morphing. She's making her own family with the witches and Hunter (and Hunter's dad) and her new Grandpa and at the same time seeing that family ties you grew up with are not always healthy (ie breaking things off with Jason but realizing that she will have to talk to him eventually). So I liked the book; it is definitely setting up for some more good times in the Sookie-verse. But instead of sating me on Sookie for a while, it's just increased my angst for the next book. (Sneaky trick!) ...more \"Men are incomprehensible assholes,\" I said to Amelia. \"No shit,\" she said. \"When I was searching for Bob today, I found a female cat in the woods with kittens.

I swear, baby, it's not what it looks like! So, there are a lot of different storylines going on in this book, but no romance at all. That was kind of refreshing. \"Men are incomprehensible assholes,\" I said to Amelia. \"No shit,\" she said. \"When I was searching for Bob today, I found a female cat in the woods with kittens.

She also meets her fairy great grandfather, but that also feels like a set-up for a future story. And, she gets involved in both Were and Vamp politics - again. It almost felt like a transition book that was clearing the way for the next story. But, it was still entertaining enough. Sookie herself doesn't seem to grow-up much in these books.

We've got followup on the backlash from a certain action Sookie had to take to defend herself in Book Four, and we've got followup on the screwup a side character made a couple books ago. We even get Sookie making a Significant Family Discovery at the end. All of this is very well and good, but with so many things going on in the story, it made it a crowded read for me. All of the individual plotlines were interesting, but none of them really felt like they got enough attention. Overall, the book feels very much like a bridge between what's come before and what's due to come after. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the problem with a bridge is, it takes you from point A to point B and seldom gives you a reason to linger on itself. For this bridge of a book, three stars. ...more Oh, Sookie! What's not to love. I was ecstatic when this came in the mail yesterday. I had almost forgotten that I had bought it!

What I originally liked about Sookie was that despite her ablities, at heart she was a hometown girl with a low paying job and bills to pay. Her life wasn't perfect and it wasn't always easy for her to fit in with her friends and family, but she was a tough young woman that was scrappy enough to get by. When she started to become the central focus of every supe and man around her in the last few books, I worried she would go the way of Anita Blake. Then she hooked up with the truly annoying Quinn and I could not figure out what Sookie saw in him. Altogether Dead made Sookie even more Mary Suish and I felt really disheartened. So I was pleasantly surprised when this book returned Sookie to her regular life and included the secondary characters I enjoy so much. I loved seeing more of Sam and I enjoyed Bill's interactions with Sookie. I'm still a big Bill fan, mostly because I know he would die for Sookie. I believe he really does love her. Eric is sexy, but he is still self-centered and would sacrifice her if he had to. A lot happened in this book and another author may have taken the two big moments and made one book for each event. But I enjoyed that Ms. Harris melded the supernatural world events into Sookie's every day life. I liked Amelia a lot more in this book and Ocatvia intrigues me. And I have to admit, the last scene in the book was very touching. I loved it. So I'm firmly back onboard with the Sookie books and glad to be. ...more [Quoted from this book:] My heart sank into my bare feet. \u201cThe wards will hold,\u201d Amelia was saying to herself in a rapid whisper. \u201cThe wards will hold; the wards will hold.\u201d Bill was gazing at me with his dark eyes, thoughts flickering across his face in rapid succession. Frannie was looking vague and detached, but her eyes were fixed on the door. She\u2019d heard the sound, too. \u201cQuinn\u2019s out there with them,\u201d I whispered to Amelia, since she was the only one in the room who hadn\u2019t figured that out.

Amelia said, \u201cHe\u2019s on their side?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got his mom,\u201d I reminded her. But I felt sick inside. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got his sister,\u201d Amelia said. Eric looked as thoughtful as Bill. In fact, they were looking at each other now, and I could believe they were having a whole dialogue without speaking a word. All this thoughtfulness wasn\u2019t good. It meant they hadn\u2019t decided which way they were going to jump. \u201cMay we come in?\u201d asked the charming voice. \u201cOr may we treat with one of you face-to-face? You seem to have quite a few safeguards on the house.\u201d Amelia pumped her arm and said, \u201cYes!\u201d She grinned at me. Nothing wrong with a little deserved self-congratulation, though the timing of it might be a bit off. I smiled back at her, though I felt my cheeks would crack. Eric seemed to gather himself, and after one long last look at each other, he and Bill relaxed. Eric turned to me, kissed me on the lips very lightly, and looked at my face for a long moment. \u201cHe\u2019ll spare you,\u201d Eric said, and I understood he wasn\u2019t really talking to me but to himself. \u201cYou\u2019re too unique to waste.\u201d And then he opened the door. ...more Well, so far this one's better than the last one. I'm about halfway through at present. I love Pam/Amelia, Octavia, the abundance of Eric, and the fact that Quinn's missing. And although I didn't like the introduction of fey characters into the series, they're improving slightly from their origin at the outset. I am so, so tired of the weres -- I wish I could skip all the were scenes without missing important plot points (harder to do when you're listening on audiobook like I am).

I'm hoping the altercation with Priscilla is the end of their part in this book. ..... Finished. I agree with other readers that Sookie's breakup with Quinn was cold. I didn't like Quinn, at all, but it was still pretty callous. I also agree with people that the end was totally abrupt. I'm also bummed that Amelia hooked up with Tray, who sounds like a totally uninteresting biker dude with a moustache. Pam is no comparison -- so obviously better! Better than the last one, but still pretty average, over all. Also, to add to the list of weird obsessions of Charlaine Harris: anybody else notice she's obsessed with silk shirts? Nobody wears silk that often in real life. ...more Again Parker does a great read of another fun look at Harris' world. Maybe it's a guy thing, but Sookie really ticked me off. (view spoiler) [ Again, she craps on a boy friend for doing what he has to do. Poor Quinn. He's better off without her, although I wonder about her reasoning. It doesn't really make sense to me. I wonder if it isn't her blood tie to Eric talking. (hide spoiler) ] Still, I have to admire her for the way she keeps her cool & works through the horrors.

Has she become a born-again Christian? I don't remember her being like this... perhaps it's just me. I miss the irony and sarcasm of the previous book. This book is messily trying to tie-up some loose ends from the previous books, and quite un-elegantly. It should instead have been re-written as a collection of short stories I think, for too much mundane trivia and repetitive information is used in the attempt to tie th 1/2 stars.
