First things first, <+++>Warbreaker</+++> is the first book by Brandon Sanderson I read which aren't from the Mistborn series and while it doesn't live up to the greatness of the original Mistborn trilogy for me, this is still a really great read. Sanderson haven't disappoint me so far and I don't think he ever will, at least in his Cosmere works. Let me say firstly that this book is so vibrant and rich with colors. A lot of element in this book revolves around colors,<---M> from world building</---M>, plot and its magic system. This is me basically reading the entirety of the book. Plot & World-building is superb as always. Sanderson created another world, this time it is called Nasthil for us to dive into and even though this is a standalone book, it's still filled with tons of history and mythology that made the world richer in content and more immersive. There's a huge plot twist in the book which I really didn't see coming, intriguing politics, mystery and combined with Sanderson's writing, it's a guarantee the book will hooked you in from prologue to epilogue. It needed to be said though the book's pacing is really slow in some part which might bore you a bit if you're not focused. (I personally find it moving like a Ferrari compared to the last book I read so I have that going for me.) Warbreaker's pacing reminds me a lot to Well of Ascension, book 2 of the Mistborn trilogy, the pacing can be a bit slow sometimes cause it builds up heavily for the intense and great climax. No kidding, the last 10% of this book is so intense I forgot to breathe sometimes. I personally don't mind slow pacing as long as there's still some progression in the plot and world-building, which Sanderson always does but I can understand if it could bore anyone who's looking for a stabby stabby whacky whacky actions in most of the book. Almost all the main and side characters in this book are fantastic and interesting. Siri, Vivenna, Vasher, Nightblood and especially Lightsong the Bold. Here's my favorite quote by Lightsong and it summed up why I don't mock woman in real life. \u201cMocking a woman is like drinking too much wine. It may be fun for a short time, but the hangover is hell.\u201d There's too many things to explain on how great and original these characters are. The book really relies heavily on these character interactions and their developments which honestly I can't seem to get enough cause I want more of them by the end of the book. If you're looking for main heroines with great developments and not whiny, you definitely can't go wrong with reading Warbreaker. The magic system are unique and intricate, I'm starting to see that this is one of Sanderson's main specialty. It's not as complicated as Allomancy, Feruchemy & Hemalurgy from Mistborn series but it still requires a bit of thinking (I won't even bother explaining how it works). Sanderson still managed to deliver it in a way that we could understood it easily with his well structured and simple writings. The magic this time is called Breath and as I mentioned before, it revolves a bit around Colors. Just read it okay, my explanation is turd compared to him. This is the end of my review and even though Warbreaker were supposed to be a standalone, apparently we will get another sequel in the far future titled \"Nightblood\" and I definitely can't wait to read the continuation of the story. I would like to conclude this review by giving this book 4.5 colorful stars and saying Warbreaker managed to *puts on sunglasses* color me impressed and left me breath less. Get it..? cause you know.. the book's magic system is called Breath and have to do with color.. no? okay, I'm so sorry you have to read that horrible pun. I'll let myself out. ...more \"My life to yours. My Breath become yours.\u201d Buddy read with my homies at fantasy buddy reads & some of my favorite people; 1. Mary 2. Patty 3. Celeste 4.

Choko HOLY SHIT SLAP MY ASS AND CALL ME SUE! WHAT IN GODS NAME DID I JUST READ?!

Seriously how does he manage to do it ? Like honestly how does this genius think of such complex magic systems and pull them off everytime! How does he fit so much talent into one brain? I feel like Sanderson isn't even a real person, I have never ever been so mind blown before & can't believe he manages to shock & excite me with every single book he writes. All his books are just so intense and fantastic. I literally loved every second spent reading this. I kinda wished I read this before Stormlight Archive, I know it isn't in the right order to read Warbreaker first but I feel I wouldn't have missed a few connections if I had read this first and I certainly would have understood Nightblood and Zahel a lot more. (Do not Google these characters if you plan on reading Sandersons other series). This book was just so good like all of Sandersons works it is a slow burner and doesn't get action packed until about halfway through. This is one of my favorite things about Sandersons writing style, I love the slow burn & the build up (I feel like I might die of a heart attack everytime the build up starts its just intense to say the least). I'm always on the edge of my seat because his stories are so full of twists and are the least predictable books I've read. Whenever I pick up something from his Cosmere works I find myself trying to work everything out from the beginning, I feel like a detective, I'm always on the lookout for his world hoppers especially Hoid. It's like playing Where's Wally only in a book. And I feel I can never trust anyone because the bad guy is always who you don't expect. Sandersons books should come with a warning label expect the unexpected . This book had such a fantastic ending that I almost jumped out of my seat cheering for the characters I loved & I was so shocked to find out who the bad guy was, let me just say I never expected it to be that person. I read 50% of this book in three hours, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I turned a page I felt sick with anticipation. The almost sex scenes in this book shocked and surprised me, I loved it. I know Sanderson is a practicing Mormon and doesn't write sex scenes but it was awesome to have a little more passion in this book. Okay that's enough raving, this story is set in the Shardworld of Nathlis. It's about two sister Siri and Vivienne who are from Idris, basically Vivienne has been trained her whole life to be the God Kings wife to form a treaty between Idris & Hallandren. The king of Idris decides to send his youngest daughter Siri instead. Vivienne goes on a rescue mission to save her sister because a war is brewing between the two countries. In Hallandren there are living gods called the returned and basically shit turns sour and the girls & gods go on one hell of a ride. The magic in this story is in their breath.. Yep in their fucking breath.. What will he think of next ? 'Another precaution. In order to Awaken, the man would need three things: Breath, color, and a Command.' I absolutely loved Siri, I thought she was the sweetest buttercup ever, she is kind, caring, opinionated & extremely naive but she's still clever. She reminded me of Shallan from WoK. I enjoyed Siri's character development and by the end was so obsessed with her, I wanted to defend and protect her, she's so bloody sweet. Vivienne impressed me so much, like wow. Her character at the end was so badass. A few times in this book I thought she was just a pompous princess who liked tooting her own horn, but she turned my opinion around and I actually ended up liking her more then Siri. I wish I could grow my hair & change color like the princess's can, I'd never have to see a hairdresser ever again. \u201cYou're a very difficult person to manipulate, you know.\" \"Nonsense,\" he said. \"You just have to promise me that I won't have to do a thing, and then I'll do anything you want.\" \"Anything?\" \"Anything that doesn't require doing anything.\" \"That's nothing, then.\" \"Is it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, that's something.\u201d Lightsong... Ahh where do I begin ? From the start I loved Lightsong, his description was so sexy. He made me laugh everytime it was his POV, but he did end up annoying me a tad. I loved his priest and the reveal at the end made me cry so much, he is truly a wonderful person and a horrible liar. '\u201cI swear, my dear. Sometimes our conversations remind me of a broken sword.\" She raised an eyebrow.\"Sharp as hell,\" Lightsong said, \"but lacking a point.\u201d Blushweaver is a character that I couldn't stand, I do not like the bitchy pretty characters that are like \"look I've got a great set of tits and no how to use them\". I did however enjoy her flirtiness and enjoyed even more seeing her get rejected. I do feel bad for blushweaver because she wasn't that bad. 'Susebron, the God King. Awesome, terrible, holy, majestic. He had been stillborn, but had Returned.' The GOD KING, wow.. Wow.. WOW.. totally not what I expected and I loved him so much, seriously what a precious little cinnamon roll, he is so bloody lovely. What a fantastic character & what a great twist at the end. Nightblood a talking sword, that's a creep and a smart ass without even noticing. I loved his blood thirstiness he just wants to kill everyone haha oh and I also loved when he was like \"DESTROY\" wow wow wow it gave me tingles. 'He was rough. He was brutal. He had a terrible temper. But he was a good man. VASHER.... Oh me oh my... Where have you been my whole existence ? Obviously not created, haha but my god I love him. Thanks Sanderson for once again making one of the most awesome & loveable badass character ever. He was so GRUMPY I loved it. He is my grumble bum<3 also when he drew Nightblood I had goosebumps HOLY FUCKING SHIT. That was such an incredible fight scene. I really wish I could say more and write down all my theories/discoveries but I want everyone to enjoy a spoiler free review. I'm happy to keep my other secrets safe in my brain haha. \"Unknowing ignorance is preferable to informed stupidity.\u201d I recommend this book to every single person, go READ IT NOW or I'll DESTROY you with nightblood.

If a character does even a single eyebrow-raising thing, you've got their number. Anything that qualifies as \"questionable\" behavior a suspect makes. Take that well-developed cynicism and combine it with my OCD detail-orientedness, and, well . . . it's not often that I don't at least speculate when something's amiss. And so I say again: I've. Been. HAD. *grumbles* (view spoiler) [In hindsight, I feel like an idiot. The only thing keeping me from throwing myself off a cliff b/c SHAME is that so far (and don't you dare be the first) no one else saw it coming either. I told someone in a comment on one of my status updates that I felt like that Stupid Girl who thinks she can change the mind of Bad Boy who tells her up front that he's not interested in a relationship. B/c THEY TOLD US. And the WHOLE TIME I'm sitting there chuckling, thinking, \"Those guys . . . sooooo funneh.\" Not funny. Not funny at ALL. (hide spoiler) ] Moving on . . . Worldbuilding: This world is another brand new concept to me, based on color, and, honestly, it probably wouldn't have worked if it wasn't so easy to visualize (b/c not a visual person). I don't have a movie playing in my head as I'm reading a book. I have vague to not-so-vague impressions of what things and people look like, but unless a description is so detailed that I associate it with something else I've already seen, I don't develop a clear picture. And maybe that's exactly what was going on here ( The Wizard of Oz , anyone?), but, regardless, it was easy to imagine, so it did work. The basic idea revolves around a magic system fueled by soul energy (sort of . . . maybe . . . ). Only it's called Breath. The more Breaths you have, the more colorful the world around you becomes and the more magic (animating) you can perform. A person whose Breath has been stolen/taken/given up willingly is called a Drab. They're alive, but they've lost some essential spark. It's quite hideous, actually . . . but strangely compelling all the same. Characters: Sanderson does this thing . . . he gives you a character (or three) that you don't like--I don't think you're even supposed to like them--and then he grows them. Slowly. Painfully . By the end, even if you still don't like them, you have respect for their journey, and you see how you could like them once they've weathered life's storm of reality checks. These characters are always young adults, so the forging process is entirely believable. This sort of thing doesn't work for me outside of fantasy, b/c not enough book. Here though . . . there are plenty of other characters you do like to take the heat off the ones you have to patient with. I like it. It adds depth and makes the scenario-- fantastical as it is --more credible. I'm not going to say anything about specific characters, b/c I don't think I can without launching a rant (b/c tricked and/or heartbroken). Just believe me with I say that they are wonderful and easy to connect with. *rants* *sobs* *glowers* *wails* Plot: This is going to be short, not b/c it wasn't compelling, but b/c the plot points are simple and effective: arranged marriage to unify two nations on the brink of war. It does not go as planned. Conjecture: (view spoiler) [I think Clod the Lifeless (HA!) is really Arsteel. I think his pseudo-sentience can be explained by being a Returned who was turned into a Lifeless. It would also explain Vasher's strange response to Vivenna when she mentioned that Denth and co. had a Lifeless. (hide spoiler) ] Everything else: This is only my second Sanderson read, but in addition to the character(s)-you-don't-like, other patterns are also emerging. I like this, too. It makes me feel like I understand the author and his story-telling process, so when he does one of those things that are typical of him, I can sit back and say, \"That Sanderson . . . ha ha, ho ho . . . look at him doing that thing he does,\" b/c it feels like I know him. These things are: 1. SURPRISE Bad Guy 2. Last 10% that might literally kill you (b/c heart attack). 3. HERO. As in true Hero to inspire epic poetry, b/c gloriously selfless and loyal and ALL THE THINGS that a Hero is supposed to be. There are probably others, but I haven't picked up on them yet, b/c Sanderson noob. BUT. Believe me, I will keep you posted, and WARBREAKER is a must read, regardless of where you happen to be on your journey through the Cosmere. Highly recommended. .[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more This is not on the same level for me as Mistborn but I do have a feeling that I'll appreciate this one even more as time goes on and I'm looking forward to discussing it more in detail during with my gush video! \"My life is yours.

And so, to avoid war, one of them must leave her home to marry the God King of Hallandren, a man reputed to be a monster. Read a book by Brandon Sanderson, and certain things are guaranteed to appear. An innovative magic system for one, and a really interesting religion. As a huge fan of traditional magic in fantasy, I am practically never impressed by new and innovative magic systems, and since this is more or less Sanderson\u2019s most well-known strength it may be part of the reason why I am not so fascinated by his writing as a lot of other people are. Religion has always fascinated me however, and the mythology surrounding the God King of Hallandren and the Court of Gods was perhaps what I enjoyed the most about this book. The religious aspect is even more visible here than in the Mistborn trilogy. The characters\u2026 what to say about those? There are four POVs of any importance. Siri and Vivenna are mostly boring, and the latter is also quite frustrating from time to time. Might be an unpopular opinion, but there it is. The third is Lightsong the Bold, god of bravery, and though he\u2019s a really nice guy whose repertoire of witticism and puns never seems to be depleted, his chapters are the ones where absolutely nothing is happening. But after more or less calling three of four POV characters boring, I should also mention that there are exceptions. Almost all the POVs have interesting chapters, especially towards the end. However , and it is a really important however, the fourth POV is absodamnlutely amazing. Vasher is a mysterious guy running around in the shadows of Hallandren with his companion Nightblood, who is nothing less than a sentient sword. I\u2019ll leave the details hanging, but if someone could challenge the great Kelsier as my favourite Sanderson character, it would most definitely be this duo. And, apparently to compensate for the boring main characters, Sanderson has included yet another amazing duo in this book: namely Denth and Tonk Fah, the mercenaries with the fabulous mercenary humour. At first they seem almost to be introduced to the story as comic relief, but as the story progresses, the reader discovers that they are really so much more. One other thought: while reading this book, it struck me how simple it actually is. That is not meant in any negative way, but despite the innovative magic system and the developed religious system that are apparently mandatory in a Sanderson book, this is not particularly complex. The plot is fairly straightforward without any completely unpredictable twists, the characters are witty and simple people, and the purity and innocence of some of them is actually quite funny. So in the end, I\u2019d say that this was a good book, and a recommendable one, but not as good as I would have hoped. I have now read five Sanderson stories of which only one was a masterpiece, but I\u2019ll expect him to provide me with more in the future. An author this popular will always get the highest possible expectations from me, but I still believe he is perfectly able to meet them. \u201cIt's odd,\u201d he finally said, \u201cwhat history does to a man.\u201d ...more What is better than Pi day (3.14)?

This is my 8th Brandon Sanderson book and while I\u2019ve read eight books by other authors you always know their pattern or formula for the books and they get a bit repetitive. That is so not true with Brandon Sanderson. The only formula he follows is how to be awesome. Just when I think I know who the bad guy will be or what he is planning because I\u2019ve read his other books I find that I was completely wrong and he broke that mold after he used it and will never use it again. Warbreaker is a world where the magic exists from the life force or breaths of people and colors. The more breathes you carry the more magic you can do and the more attuned your senses are. This is a world where some men and women have returned from the dead and they live off those breathes or breathes can be used to reanimate inanimate objects and dead things. It is an unusual and unique magic system and once again Sanderson was able to create a fantastic world around it. There was a great war over 300 years ago and that is when a Returned took over the region in a great war. Only a few of the areas kept their sovereignty and Idris was one of them. That is where the original royal family retreated to. Now after many years Idris is supposed to send a princess to the returned God King in an attempt to blend the royal lines and produce an heir with royal blood. Once that task is complete the princess will most likely be killed. No matter what it seems like a war between Idris and Hallandren is imminent. Like all of Sanderson works the world is creatively made with a magic system, religions, political machinations and so many rich characters and cultures that it is impossible not to fall in love with the world and he creates. I always enjoy the way that he intertwines the religions and the cultures. Sanderson is able to give an unbiased view for all by using PoVs on all side of them and giving unique insights into the belief system of each. It just shows that perception is everything and right and wrong really seems different depending on where you are standing. \u201cThat's why we get annoyed by you Idrians. So high, so certain that what you do is right. If your god asked you to give up your Breath\u2014or even the Breath of your child\u2014wouldn't you do it? You give up your children to become monks, forcing them into a life of servitude, don't you? That's seen as a sign of faith. Yet when we do something to serve our gods, you twist your lips at us and call us blasphemers.\u201d The Characters : I always praise Sanderson books for all of the rich characters. He has some of the best supporting characters of any author I\u2019ve ever read. Lightsong a Returned in the God Court was one of my favorite characters in the book. He gets to be the funny character that is a God in a religion he doesn\u2019t believe in. The other Gods are all playing at politic around him but his only ambition in life currently is to be as useless as possible. However for as useless and redundant as he tries to be it seems that he will be caught up in whatever is happening one way or another. All of his conversations are so much fun I laughed at nearly all of them. \u201cRegardless, you ask why I did not greet you. Well, let us assume that I had acted as you suggest I should. Upon your approach, you would have had me gush over you?\u201d \u201cNaturally.\u201d \u201cYou would have me point out how stunning you appear in that gown?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t complain.\u201d \u201cMention how your dazzling eyes glisten in the fireworks like burning embers?\u201d \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d \u201cExpound on how your lips are so perfectly red that they could leave any man breathless with wonder, yet drive him compose the most brilliant of poetry each time he recalled the moment?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d be flattered for certain.\u201d \u201cAnd you claim you want these reactions from me?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cWell blast it, woman,\u201d Lightsong said, picking up his cup. \u201cIf I\u2019m stunned, dazzled, and breathless, then how the hell am I supposed to greet you? By definition, won\u2019t I be struck dumb?\u201d She laughed. \u201cWell, then, you\u2019ve obviously found your tongue now.\u201d \u201cSurprisingly, it was in my mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cI always forget to check there.\u201d There is also the rebellious princess Siri that has been sent by her father to marry the God King and is surprised by what she finds at the palace. Her sister Vivenna who is convinced she must save Siri from a terrible fate who is trying to stir up trouble in the city with the help of a band of mercenaries. And Vasher who has a mysterious sentient sword that speaks inside your head. Vasher was one of the more interesting characters. He was an enigma for most of the book and I will say that sword is creepy and wonderful all at the same time (view spoiler) [The fact the sword is in WoR worries me a lot because it is super dangerous in the hands of the man in black (hide spoiler) ] I grew to like his semi grumpy ways. He has been around for a while and has a past to make up for. \u201cIt was strange, how easily and quickly protection could cause destruction. Sometimes, Vasher wondered if the two weren't really the same thing. Protect a flower, destroy pests who wanted to feed on it. Protect a building, destroy the plants that could have grown in the soil. Protect a man. Live with the destruction he creates.\u201d The resolution wasn\u2019t quite as great as some of his other books, still it all filters out in the end and that last 20% like always is a doozy.

The number of perspectives, the intricacy of the plot, the pace of action, everything was just perfectly well written. I want to take a moment and explain a small thing about myself and why this book, as well as Sanderson's \"It's funny, Vasher thought, how many things begin with my getting thrown into prison.\" Warbreaker is one of those books that I will think back on and say \"Wow that was a really well balanced fantasy novel.\" And by well balanced I mean that everything was in perfect proportion. The number of perspectives, the intricacy of the plot, the pace of action, everything was just perfectly well written. I want to take a moment and explain a small thing about myself and why this book, as well as Sanderson's other works, are among my favorite fantasy novels. I come from a religious background. I won't go as far as to say that I suffered abuse at the hands of my religion, but I definitely feel that I was brainwashed to an extent. When I turned 17 or 18 I really started to question the things I had been taught, and it was a devastatingly emotional process for me to reevaluate my values and belief system. I now feel 100% more comfortable with who I am and what I believe, but the journey to this point nearly wrecked me. And so, it's natural that Sanderson's characters would speak to me the way they do. The contradiction of ingrained religious beliefs is almost always a corner stone in his characters' development. I personally understand that struggle, and so I find myself sympathizing heavily with them. \"Didn't you ever stop to think that maybe you were on the wrong side?\" I had two specific \"problems\" with this novel, and it's hard to really even call them problems. I'm just being nitpicky. One is the magic system. While I found it very interesting, I guess I don't fully understand why it's considered color magic? People with \"breath\" are bestowed with heightened senses, able to make out subtle distinction of color and sound. With a certain amount of \"breath\", people are able to awaken objects to do their bidding. When \"breath\" is used, it drains color. But I'm a little lost on how the draining of color is really related the use of \"breath\". It's very possible I missed the explanation somewhere along the line, but I often forgot it was a color magic system. Second is the length of the novel. I JUST WANT IT TO BE LONGER! I want to keep reading about these characters. Warbreaker ended in a way that satisfies me for now , but I want to know more. In short, I want a sequel. This one wrapped up way smoother than Elantris did, but I still have some questions and curiosities. Overall, and excellent book. I love reading about people who are forced to step outside of their comfort zone. I love seeing them work through their situation and make compromises for the sake of their goals. And I love fantasy settings. Sanderson's stories are masterfully crafted, nuanced and distinctive from others in the same genre, and I cannot wait to devour the rest of his work.

I have gotten so used to his brilliance already that it doesn't surprise me anymore - I have come to expect it from him and wonder if he will ever write something that lets my high expectations down... Well, not this time, that is for sure! I love the universe Sanderson has created for the majority of his Fantasy, of which this world is a part of. This time the magic system depends on the human \"breath\" , which is something like the spark of our soul, though not the soul itself, which gives us the joy and true vision of our lives. Without it we can still live normal lives, only duller, less colorful, less joyful, less \"alive\"... The people who give their breath away to the maggi, who are called Awakeners here, have to do so willingly and are usually well paid, thus most of those who \"choose* to give their breath away are poor and by their act secure some help for their families... They become Drabs. The Awakeners use the gathered breath to \"awaken\", or infuse object with parts of it and in combination with well crafted commands makes those alivened object perform desired tasks. The more breath a person acquires, the longer they live, the healthier they are, and the higher status they achieve. There is one more component to make the magic work - color. For the transfer of breath to work, it uses the color from objects around it, but for best results, a bright cloth seems to work best. And, on top of the food chain and social leather are the G-ds, those who have died, but somehow awaken spontaneously and start needing a breath a week just to stay alive. However, they become whatever their view of perfection is, and are treated as gods, their every move followed by their dedicated priests, their every word recorded and carefully interpreted as a guide for the future. These gods are led by the G-d King, a Returned as a baby and gifted with an inordinate amount of breaths, making him a singularly powerful individual. This is kind of the set up for the story and where things begin. The G-D King needs an heir, thus he needs a wife. The neighboring kingdom has promised one of its princesses for a wife, mostly as a diplomatic guarantee against war, and sends the youngest daughter to perform her duties. Political intrigues ensue and unrest is brewing in the streets. The pantheon of gods are forming factions and we are plunged into a variety of different conflicts, always kept wondering who is going to do what and what are their motivations... This is a very dry way of me explaining the vibrant and dynamic range of storytelling Sanderson gifts us with in this story, but it does give the basics, which I hope sounds like something you guys would like to check out. Because it is not only about the Fantasy, it is also about the human relationships, the banter, the things that make us heroes in the eyes of the ones around us, our self awareness, and the way we perceive the world around us. It is a story of human experience. I will whole heartedly recommend this to all reading fans, regardless of age or genre preference. It is worth the read and is a perfect gateway to Sanderson's work.

This was my first buddy-read with royalty: Lady Luna , Marquess Mary , and Prince Petrik . Love you guys! I feel sated. I had high hopes for Warbreaker , and those hopes were far surpassed. I cannot comprehend the mind of Brandon Sanderson. How does he come up with such complex magic systems, layered religions, and multifaceted characters? Not just once, but multiple times in multiple different universes? I know that they\u2019re all part of the same Cosmere, and I can\u2019t wait for more information about what exactly the Cosmere is and how everything connects to be revealed. Fantasy is my favorite genre. I came to it a little late in the game, and there is a multitude of authors whose works I\u2019ve yet to read. I\u2019ve picked up books by Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks, and other founding fathers of the modern fantasy genre, but that was before I had any true interest in fantasy and I didn\u2019t stick with them. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll give them another try one day. But Sanderson grabbed me from page one of The Final Empire . And he still hasn\u2019t let me go. With the rate of his fictional output, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be letting me go for a long, long time. Now, on to Warbreaker itself. I don\u2019t really have words for how much I loved this story. The magic system depended on Breath, with which each person is born. However, a person\u2019s Breath can be given up to another without causing death to the giver, resulting in those who stockpile Breath. With a plethora of Breaths come various Heightenings, each of which affects the bearer different. The First Heightening allows one to sense the auras of others, the next gives perfect pitch, and on and on they go. Those who reach the Fifth Heightening are ageless, and can live forever. Those with a multitude of Breaths can also Awaken inanimate objects and Command said objects to do their will. Breath can even be used to Awaken and Command Lifeless, which are basically non-decomposing zombies. There\u2019s another way to live on after death, however; if a person died a particularly heroic death, they could come back as a Returned, otherwise known in Hallandren as gods. But becoming a god comes with a price. The magic system and religions were incredibly interesting, but they would have fallen flat without such an interesting cast of characters backing them up. Siri and Vivenna are sisters, princesses from a kingdom of grays and beiges where humility is their greatest calling. One sister embraces her duty, becoming exactly what her country needs her to be and training to become the wife of the God King, the ruler of her kingdom\u2019s greatest rival. The other sister shirks responsibility and runs wild, basking in the freedom of her unimportance. But a decision is made that changes to lives of both sisters forever. In my opinion, these sisters are the backbone of the story. That being said, there is a host of other amazing characters: Lightsong, one of the Returned who doesn\u2019t believe in his own deity; Llarimar, Lightsong's high priest who has enough faith for both of them; Denth and Tonk Fah, mercenaries with a sense of humor; the God King, larger than life and mysterious in his silence; Vasher, an Awakener with incredible skill, a murky past, and less-than-perfect people skills; and Nightblood, Vasher\u2019s talking, bloodthirsty sword. Such a varied and interesting group of people! I have immense respect for the work that Sanderson puts into his books. They build slowly, giving the reader time to become invested in the lives of the characters, but the last hundred or so pages progress at breakneck speed, with plot twists on almost every page. And the most wonderful part is that the twists are so unexpected! I\u2019m fairly good at predicting the outcomes of books, but I\u2019ve yet to predict anything written by Sanderson. I think one of the reasons is that he\u2019s not a third-person omniscient writer. He never implements heavy-handed foreshadowing that spoils the surprise of the story. Sanderson even utilizes characters to explain his magic systems and religions instead of explaining them himself, which makes them so much more interesting. As far as I can tell, Sanderson is an author with a deep respect of the intellect of his readers, and he refuses to spoon-feed them anything. (Also, he's the most prolific fantasy author, in my eyes; he shows his readers love by working incredibly hard to get us new books as quickly as possible!) One day, I\u2019ll reread the other Sanderson books I\u2019ve read up until this point and give them the reviews they deserve. In the mean time, I\u2019ll add this to my special bookshelf where all of my favorites reside. Because that\u2019s what Warbreaker is, without a doubt; a new favorite. I can\u2019t wait to dig into more of Sanderson\u2019s work. Stormlight Archives, here I come! ...more 2.5 Let me start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised.

For some reason I was expecting another epic type fantasy, with lots of travel and descriptions of foliage, and I was very glad to find myself mistaken in that regard. I enjoyed the more personal aspect of the story, and the intrigue and mystery which went along with it. It was definitely a page-turned, especially towards the end when I wanted to see how everything would work out. So why only 2 1/2 stars? A few reasons. The first is that it was a pretty straight-forward story, for the most part, and I found a lot of it to be predictable. The parts that weren't predictable seemed a bit forced. Well, let me be fair - I was on board for the first twist. It made sense and all the signs were there and I, like Vivenna, was annoyed with myself for not having seen it coming. But the second twist seemed forced. Another reviewer compared it to Shymalan and his need to throw in insane twists for the sake of it. I wouldn't go that far, but I did feel a bit annoyed with it, which hampered my overall view of the story. Secondly, while I liked some of the characters in a distant sort of way, I never really conntected with any of them. I don't know if it's because of the change of perspective, or because the characters felt like they were there to fit the story more than the story fitting them, but I just never connected with any of the characters on a level where I would've been really upset if something happened to them. I liked Siri and the God King. I enjoyed Lightsong most of the time. Vasher, a character type I normally love, didn't do it for me, though. Denth and Tonk Fah were ok with the banter, though I didn't find them nearly as amusing as some others did. Vivenna always just sort of annoyed me, and did so even at the end after her growth. I guess it just never felt like her growth was really growth, if that makes any sense. Lastly, while it was page-turning towards the end, I felt the middle dragged a bit. It took awhile for things to get into place, which is fine, but it felt like the scenes where we switched from character to character to see how things were progressing, were pretty much the same scenes we'd seen last time. Yes, I know little things were happening... I don't know, it just felt like some of it was unnecessary padding. The internal monologues were the worst. The characters kept asking themselves the same questions of who they were and what they believed. While I love philosophical quandries in general, it felt a bit forced - it felt that the author was trying to get certain points across (points I don't necessarily disagree with), but perhaps the best method for this wasn't repetition of parable/event, then have the characters think over their lessons... Rinse, wash, repeat... So, anyway, overall it was an enjoyable romp, the system of magic was interesting (since everyone goes on about that I feel I should make a mention of it), and the story was, generally, well told. I just wish I'd cared more about the characters and not just about the intrigue. I might pick up the hinted at sequel - though since neither Vasher nor Vivenna were my favorite characters, I'm not sure. And while I certainly haven't sworn off the author, I'm not compelled to run out and buy his other books, either. ...more Brandon Sanderson is for many, one of the best fantasy writers and his books are listed among almost any top ten fantasy book list and I always thought my first Sanderson book would be The Way of Kings or The Final Empire but somehow Warbreaker ended up to be my first foray into the mind of Sanderson.

Depending on the writing some books need more time to get in to. This is not that kind of book. Prologue features a mysterious character on an assassination mission wielding a badass sword with a mind of his own and we are also introduced with a cool magic system. All of my fantasy boxes were ticked and I wanted more. Warbreaker\u2019s magic system is wonderfully created and visualised and it plays an important role in defining the world in which is set. It affects people's political views, motivation and their religious beliefs and clash of those beliefs is the turning wheel of this story. The heart and soul of Warbreaker is political suspense and a mystery. The plot thickens with every page and there are a few twists and turns along the way that make for a very unpredictable voyage. The characters are very well written. If characters manage to make me laugh, make me feel sad for them or even make me mad, I call that a job well done. Sanderson created a colorful world full of intrigue and mystery, the story was gripping and full of twists and mind games. He builds the tension slowly and sets up the cascade of events to give us the big finish that includes multiple and unforeseeable twists with surprising conclusion to this tale. This is my first Sanderson read, but it certainly will not be the last. ...more WOW, WOW, WOW!!! I really have spoiled myself far too much after feeling exultant due to exams being over and holidays having begun.

And then secondly I read this absolute gem of a novel. But then I have found all of Brandon Sanderson's serious fantasy books to be gems. I just hope he can carry his work ethic across to the YA series he is writing and that he can finish off the Wheel of Time in strong form. But if Warbreaker is anything to look at (and considering that he works at so many stories at once) the man is a prolific genius in my opinion. How can I de s cribe this book a nd wh y I loved it. I loved the worldbuilding as per usual for a Sanderson novel. I loved the humour (something I've not seen a lot of in a Sanderson novel). I loved the magic system (something that I do see in Sanderson novels). I loved the characters and truly cared about them. And not every work of fiction does that for me. I loved nearly everything. I did find the end a little rushed and I still wondered about the history of this world but compared to how good the book was those were little faults. The sto r y follows two girls, some m e rcenaries, a unique mysterious warrior, a flippant go d , several other gods/goddesses and the God King of this world. It turns out that one of the girls (princesses I should specify) was promised to be married to the God King to produce him an heir and so have the God King continue in the future. Of course the wrong princess (Siri) ends up being sent along and refuses to produce an heir this of course leads to some interesting revelations. On the other hand we are introduced to Vasher, a mysterious warrior who we have no clue of his intentions and what he is doing with the gods and people of this world. Is he out to assassinate someone or start a war? More is revealed as to why he is important in the book later but from the beginning you are left to wonder. The other princess (Vivenna) however runs into two mercenaries, Denth and Tonk Fah, who promise to help her retrieve her sister from the marriage. Then while these events are happening we have the flippant god Lightsong (the bold) who is trying to make sense of his purpose in the pantheon of Hallandren. The magic system w as f a scinating he r e. The idea is that every b eing has one b r eath they ar e n a turally born with that can be given to others for money. Breath can be used by those with enough to awa k en obj e cts that contain colou r and hence cause them to live. As a result there were some interesting scenes with living material and unique zombie type soldiers (view spoiler) [(oh and there's a living sword which you meet in the first chapter) (hide spoiler) ] . However the 'gods' or 'Returned' have to replenish their breath to keep living on and so the whole religion depends on the sacrifice of breath without which individuals cannot see the brightness of life. A huge part of why I really liked this book had to do with the conflict of interests that existed a n d th e hidden agendas. I also love how flippant Lightsong was (I mean a God who revels in being facetious and using tons of puns? How e x tremely awesome is t hat!). What drove the book was how characters were forced to lay aside prejudices in order to survive and the web of secrets behind the gods and their priests. A lot of misdirecting occurred within the plot which was fun as I had to try and work out which characters honestlyb were good. Twice I found characters I had found humorous were actually serious villains which was a clever twist. Ultimately while some may find it over-lengthy, over-worded and slow I found it to be a fun, gripping novel full of worldbuilding. The end was a little rushed however its overall quality could not be denied and I did like the ultimate revelations at the conclusion. If you're looking for a book to keep you engaged that has an interesting consequence based magic system that's a nice plot device on the side rather than a dominating feature then you should enjoy this book. There's a little of everything from political intrigue and religious debates (what surprise from Sanderson!) and some fascinating characters and great action. Not to be missed fantasy. ...more This was such an amazing book! I already mentioned that Sanderson's ability to create new worlds and magic systems.

Excalibur from Arthurian legends. Stormbringer from Elric saga by Michael Moorcock. Dragnipur from Malazan series by Steven Erikson. Callandor from Wheel of Time epic by Robert Jordan. Lightsaber from Star Wars movies. Masamune from Japanese folklore. Gurthang from Silmarillion classic by J.R.R. Tolkien. For people unfamiliar with the book let me introduce you to Nightblood: it is a sword which can hold pretty well on its own against any one of the above. It also happened to be one of the best characters in the novel. Two kingdoms have an uneasy truth between them, but some forces within one of them make everything in their power to start an all-out war. The only hope for peace the other kingdom has? Two sisters with one of them mixed up in the conflict for a good old reason of literally being in the wrong place at the wrong time and another one being misguided into helping the first. I am afraid I finally began sounding like a broken record, but avoid reading the book blurb as this one gives huge spoiler right in line 3 . Was it really necessary? I already mentioned Nightblood being one of the best characters as a novel's strength. In also has a very interesting view on religion in general. Some of the characters have really good sense of humor which makes even boring parts less boring. I do not need to mention interesting world and magic system: it is Brandon Sanderson we are talking about. Coming to the novel's weaknesses I already mentioned one: Nightblood is one of the best characters. If the sword is the best character, what does it make actual people of the story? Boring, that is what. Take humor from Lightsong; you will end up with a character who does not do anything at all until the end of the novel. Exciting, is not it? Vivenna is equally boring and she does not even have Lightsong's humor to boot. To be fair she does become interesting in the very last part of the book. Brandon Snaderson is an undisputed master of one-on-one combat scenes. Look at the first book of Mistborn trilogy or that of Reckoners series as a proof. This time he does not use his strength as such scenes only appear during the last 20 pages or so. What really saves this book from mediocre rating is a series of plot twist in the end - one of which is casually spoiled in the blurb as I mentioned. My final verdict: decent book with some interesting ideas and discussions, but lower that the usual author's standards; 3.5 stars rounded down. ...more Enjoyed this a lot.

But this is also a tale of self-discovery, sacrifice, religion, bravery and redemption. I enjoyed this read, again so much different of anything I've read before. Brandon Sanderson is a fascinating storyteller. He has a vivid imagination and an inimitable skill to weave stories with various and complex characters evolving in new, independent worlds each time. My life to yours, my Breath become yours. Another particularity of BS's books is the amazing magic systems, always intricate and yet easy to understand. They have clear instructions, rules and restrictions; which is refreshing and very different from most classical fantasy works where the magician/wizard/sorcerer mutters some incantation in an unfathomable language and waves his hands/wand/whatever and things just happen. In Warbreaker, the magic system is original, again!, and quite amazing. The prerequisite is to have a fair number of Breaths (each person has originally one of those) and then Awakening consists on infusing objects with Breath to animate them and bid them act as you will with a simple spoken instruction. The characters were great. One of my favorite was Lightsong, the Returned god of bravery. He didn't believe in his own godhood and put a lot of effort in being useless, and yet found himself involved in twisted political schemes. His interactions with Blushweaver were tiresome though and quite pointless. Even he agrees with me! :P See for yourself! \u201cI swear, my dear.

The two mercenaries however added of lot of fun to the read without being caricatural (view spoiler) [and their plot twist was huge! OMG, I didn't see that coming! (hide spoiler) ] . Vasher and Nightblood were very intriguing and while the sword's intentions were very clear all along the book, Vasher was very difficult to judge (view spoiler) [and his motives were revealed at the very end of the story (hide spoiler) ] and I really want to know more about his past. Warbreaker was a fun read and a different kind of fantasy, with a major focus on the characters' development and interactions. The pacing was globally slow but the last 20% were thrilling, as usual! ...more Warbreaker is a complicated world, full of rules and words you might find confusing, but also incredibly addictive to read with great characters. Sanderson knows how to explain his magic systems; he knows how to drive you through it slowly, so if you don\u2019t mind having a slow pace Sanderson is definitely someone you want to read. An amazing epic adult fantasy full with perfect dialogs, great twists and perfect balance between politics, religion and magic. Para fans de la fantas\u00eda de verdad.

An amazing epic adult fantasy full with perfect dialogs, great twists and perfect balance between politics, religion and magic. Para fans de la fantas\u00eda de verdad. Odio decir eso, la fantas\u00eda es fantas\u00eda venga como venga pero desgraciadamente tenemos un hit por las fantapendejadas \u00faltimamente y AGUAS! Porque se viene el NA-high-fantasy (no le tengo ni un poco de fe sinceramente) , gracias Sarah J. Maas por tu aportaci\u00f3n (?) Entonces si, El Aliento de los dioses es para los que de verdad buscan magia interesante en una fantas\u00eda, temas adultos y no escenas adultas en una fantas\u00eda \u00e9pica adulta . Porque, o sea, si saben que hay una diferencia no? Muy por encimita: La gente en este mundo tiene alientos y se pueden acumular, depende de cuantos tengas es la Elevaci\u00f3n que alcanzas niveles pues, y con cada elevaci\u00f3n pues obviamente te haces mas ching\u00f3n. Puedes crear sinvidas (zombis), o despertar cosas inanimadas como cuerdas, telas, etc. Todo esto por medio de ordenes o sea palabras que les dices para que cobren vida, esto consume tus alientos pero si despiertas algo lo puedes recoger despu\u00e9s de usarlo, no con los sinvidas. No se han perdido? A muy grandes rasgos ese es el sistema de magia, muy grandes rasgos. Este sistema es mucho m\u00e1s complejo, tiene much\u00edsimas reglas que vas aprendiendo conforme pasan las p\u00e1ginas. Y gracias a eso las primeras como 300 paginas son muy lentas. Si, leyeron bien 300 p\u00e1ginas (o mas). 300 paginas son una introducci\u00f3n enorme pero como dije antes, si estas interesado en saber la pol\u00edtica-religi\u00f3n-magia de este mundo te va a interesar , si no, pues no, ni siquiera lo intentes, Sanderson no es para ti entonces. Y lo que pasa es que necesitas entender el sistema antes de entrar de lleno a la trama porque si no solo te vas a revolver. Sanderson se lo apuesta TODO a que estes interesado en estos temas maduros que necesitan mucha explicaci\u00f3n. La trama en si no la explicare, de hecho si ya te le\u00edste Elantris ya te sabes la trama general. El desarrollo por otro lado en El aliento de los dioses es muy distinto y es lo que hace de la lectura algo muy interesante. De entrada los personajes principales me gustaron mucho , hablando de forma t\u00e9cnica todos hasta los secundarios o incluso en ciertas ocasiones, terciarios, est\u00e1n muy bien desarrollados y pensados. Se leen bastante humanos, la gran mayor\u00eda tiene defectos muy grandes pero conforme pasa el libro se ve un cambio claro en su forma de ser debido a las circunstancias a las que se enfrentaron. En pocas palabras, el desarrollo de personajes es perfecto. Hablando de forma fangirl: TE AMO DENTH! Vivenna y Vasher 4 life! Sondeluz mis respetos eres grande! En realidad hay al menos un personaje para cada gusto XD Los di\u00e1logos son muy inteligentes y din\u00e1micos y hacen que la primera mitad se lea de forma muy entretenida y no tan densa o pesada y eso es un movimiento muy inteligente por parte del autor. Yo pod\u00eda leer conversaciones ENTERAS POR DIAS de Vivenna, Denth y Tonk Fah se los juro. TODO.EL.DIA Me gusto como se desarrollo la trama principal , como todo encaja o tiene importancia al \u00faltimo y el final es muy bueno, abierto y bastante interesante. El cl\u00e1sico \u201cesperen la secuela\u201d la cual estoy muy impaciente por leer\u2026cuando salga D: Recomendad\u00edsimo , si de verdad te gusta la fantas\u00eda, tienes que leer a Sanderson. \"El valor de las cosas esta en como se las trata, divina gracia.\" Hubo muchos detalles que adore, pero son spoilers; ahi les va: (view spoiler) [Denth vs Vasher: Me encanto esa ultima pelea. Que no fuese el cl\u00e1sico \u201cyo soy el principal y aunque mi adversario se supone que es mejor que yo por alguna casualidad del destino le gane y viva la felicidad woohoo!\u201d No. Denth se lo iba a chingar, el gano el duelo t\u00e9cnicamente y me encanta que Vasher ganara sobre el por un truco mas que por habilidad, eso es ser realista. No todos los h\u00e9roes son tambi\u00e9n victoriosos. Kalad-Dalapaz-Vasher: Venga ya! Nunca se me ocurri\u00f3 que fueran el mismo, y tiene mucho sentido, los 5 sabios y que por su culpa la Multiguerra inicio y todo ese rollo fue GENIAL. Rey-Dios: Le cortaron la lengua!!!!!! BASTARDOS! No lo vi venir, lo admito, si cre\u00ed que era un ser malvado. Ups! Sorry Susebron, te quiero. Muchos otros, pero esos fueron los mejores a mi parecer! No se que ser\u00e1 el segundo libro sin la chispa de mi Denth, lo extra\u00f1are. Y creo que una historia corta de el y los 5 sabios estar\u00eda INCREIBLE. Creo que ya no es ning\u00fan secreto que tuve un crush intens\u00edsimo con Denth durante todo el libro!

I've only started geeking out on the details and intricacies of the Cosmere after I've read all his books as I didn't want to accidentally stumble upon spoilers. Cosmere spoiler: (view spoiler) [The sub-context underlying his stories of how the existence of different Shards affect the Investiture in different worlds is sublime. Warbreaker takes place in a world called Nalthis and Investiture takes the form of BioChromatic Breath which is the power of life there. Nalthis has one Shard in its world and the nature of that Shard endowed every living being with a single Breath upon birth. This single Breath, however, can be given away upon the free will of its owner, and the people actually 'trade' in this valuable commodity. I can go on and on to describe why Breath is so valuable and the powers it bestows, but that is not the point of this review and I doubt I can do a better job than Sanderson in this book. (hide spoiler) ] The plot in Warbreaker is simple. It's about an arranged marriage set 20 years ago between two kingdoms to stop a war, and in spite of the agreement being honoured (somewhat), keeping the peace was getting increasingly tenuous. The main focus of this story was really on the characters and role reversals seemed to be the name of the game here. We have two sisters (Siri and Vivenna) of opposite personalities undertaking a change in their pre-ordained course of life which forced them to grow in ways that was unexpected. Then there was a God named Lightsong the Bold who did not believe in his own divinity and was constantly trying to undermine himself to be useless and unreliable. The development of these characters in the book was necessarily slow and a bit painful at times in the case of Vivenna, but it felt right . By the end of the book, the culmination of the individual arcs of the two sisters and Lightsong was both triumphant and bittersweet Then there were Vasher and Nightblood - two of my favourite characters. One was truly fascinating and complex and the other being the most awesome, yet craziest and creepiest, creation I've ever read in his books. I completed this reread via Graphic Audio and the Kindle edition which contained Annotations for each chapter. The GA performance was good and when the climax of the last 10% rolled around, it became really good. Sanderson always switches to a cinematic manner of switching POVs frequently during the climax of his books to convey tension. And it works every single time. While Sanderson obviously puts a lot of care into worldbuilding and magic systems that are different, I increasingly find that the characters he writes about are the true heart of his stories . Although not every one of these characters are beloved, it's hard not to notice the amount of careful thought and development placed in them. This was probably one of the main reasons why his books are usually quite long with uneven pacing at times when he focuses on these characters pretty much doing nothing except growing into their part. It might be boring for some understandably, but ultimately it worked for me. ...more Warbreaker is another great Brandon Sanderson epic fantasy novel. Like his other books this had great world building, a fantastic and unique system of magic, and a ton of memorable characters. Warbreaker is the story of two sisters and their attempts to stop two nations from going to war. All set in a world where those who die in glory are returned as Gods, and souls are the fuel that keeps both the returned Gods alive, and powers the biochromatical magic system. Warbreaker is a superb book and Warbreaker is another great Brandon Sanderson epic fantasy novel.

Warbreaker is the story of two sisters and their attempts to stop two nations from going to war. All set in a world where those who die in glory are returned as Gods, and souls are the fuel that keeps both the returned Gods alive, and powers the biochromatical magic system. Warbreaker is a superb book and is easily worth the five stars I have given it. It had mystery, romance, surprises, intrigue, action, and great characters. What more could you want from a book?. The story was fast paced and exciting, and was full of so many twists and turns that it kept me guessing right up until the end to find out who the real bad guys were. Though in true Sanderson style there were no pure evil characters and you could even sympathize with the reasons the \"bad guys\" had for doing what they did. I really loved the concept of the Returned, and Lightsong the Brave ( one of the Returned ) was by far my favorite character. How could you not love a God who does not believe in his own divinity, and tried his best to convince others of his lack of divinity. He was lighthearted and full of such witty sarcasm that I loved his exchanges with the other characters ( Yes, all of the other characters, he really was just that entertaining ). Here is just one of the many great quotes from Lightsong: \"I try to avoid having thoughts. They lead to other thoughts, and if you're not careful those lead to actions. Actions make you tired. I have this on rather good authority from someone who once read it in a book.\" Plot revealing spoilers, read at your own peril> (view spoiler) [I suspected early on that Lightsong was heading for a tragic end, but it still packed an emotional punch when it arrived. Sanderson kills off just enough main characters in his books to leave you thinking it could happen to anyone!. As far as the rest of the main characters went, I liked both the sisters ( Vivenna and Siri ) but did find Vivenna a tad annoying in the middle of the book, she did redeem herself in the end. I was also surprised to find myself liking the God king and his romance with Siri. Vasher and his sentient sword Nightblood were mysterious and interesting characters. There really was an absolute ton of great characters in this book and it's a bit of a shame that it's a stand alone novel and not a series as there is far more stories that could be told in this world. There was a couple of real shocking moments in this book. The biggest was when Denth ( who I liked! ) and his group of mercenaries turned on Vivenna. I know they warned her what they were like, but like her I never really believed it!. I was also surprised that it was Bluefingers who was behind the war plot!. I thought for sure it would be the God kings priests or maybe one of the other Gods. (hide spoiler) ] All this raving and Warbreaker is not even my favorite Brandon Sanderson book. That honor belongs to The Way of Kings . All of Sandersons books come highly recommended by me. ...more Actual Rating: 3.5 \u201cYou see, the great thing about madness is that it's all in your head.\u201d . So, this book was recommended to me by my cousin who thought I would like it even though she never read. I think it was like some kind of experiment and I was the subject. Well, I looked around a little and I couldn't see not even one person that I was following that disliked this book. On the opposite actually, it had a lot of five stars.

Well, I looked around a little and I couldn't see not even one person that I was following that disliked this book. On the opposite actually, it had a lot of five stars. So I got it to read and I have to admit, I'm quite disappointed. Firstly we have to notice that the book is long for those who are used to read YA. For me, a book with this much pages would be choose for the third or last book of a series that I really liked or something. Still, it took me a while to get to know the worldbuilding and get used to the names - which btw, why can't these authors just give normal names like Carl, Elisa or Anna? \u201cYou see, the great thing about madness is that it's all in your head.\u201d . The POVs changed a lot too and one thing that bothered me a lot was the fact that I could know a lot about the main cast as many of the main characters had their own POVs, but the rest of the people, even those who acted a lot and were kinda important, I couldn't care less. Sometimes they would appear from far away, leave a sentence and that was it. Some characters (that I found important to the story) would just be spoken of but didn't even appeared anymore. Others left some piece of wisdom and had a huge part but I had no feelings towards them... Also, by looking at the cover I expected some badassery girl or some character development that would make me without words and was awarded with some really boring main characters. Their growth through the story consisted basically in turning one into another. And about these characters I'm talking about the two princesses. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that you don\u2019t understand a man until you understand what makes him do what he does. Every man is a hero in his own story, Princess.\u201d But then you ask me, why did I gave it such high rating? Well, as is common of these kind of books, the action at the ending was wonderful. Also we had some really good surprises which made me screen like a teenager. \u201cThey all want to be involved, but nobody wants to be responsible.\u201d And them, when we got to the actual ending I was really confused by how lacking it was. What happened to the main characters? I think I got one of those Disney endings, all that \"and they lived happily ever after...\"\" I even made a graph of my enjoyment along the story because I can't put words to my feelings: Yes, I was mostly bored. However, if you enjoy fantasy and fantasy books, I still recommend this one. Even though it had mostly bored moments, it also had some really good ones and some awesome quotes. It has a simple story but still kinda deep and meaningful and Brandon really have this nice writing style. Plus, I must say, Lightsong was too <3 \"My life to yours. My breath become yours.\u201d And now, I have to say, I ended this book with a lot of unanswered questions. I wanted the next book though :/ ...more Honestly, this was a pleasant surprise. I've heard so many times that this book wasn't as good as Brandon's other work. Here's my two word response: Fuck. That. This book was freaking awesome.

I'm just going to lie down and think about all the \"Epicness\" that I just read. 3.5 One word: pacing, Brandon Sanderson! Sort it out! This could have and should have been a 5 star read, but it wasn't. It was too slow for too long and the finale came too late to totally save it. Good cast of characters and wonderful magic system. Guys, I'm only going to say this once. You need to get Warbreaker and love it. It is unlike anything you've ever read. P.S. Lightsong is made of awesome. This hovers between a 3.5 and 4 stars for me. I absolutely enjoyed reading it, and I found myself reading large chunks of it at a time because I was so engrossed in the story. However, it didn't completely blow me away. Still, I enjoyed it much more than Elantris , which was a 3 stars for me. I found the political and religious intrigue to be really well-crafted in this story.

I think it would've been cool, and helpful, to get that sort of training montage near the beginning. I honestly can't pick a favorite character from this book because I loved them all for different reasons. Siri and Vivenna were amazing and had such interesting development. I loved their transition from ignorance to understanding and how that alters their motives and actions. It was very well done. And Susebron was really not what I expected, but he was great. Lightsong, too, was wonderful and reminded me of Sazed from Mistborn if he was a bit more snarky. Overall a really great fantasy standalone, but it could totally use a sequel! I need more resolution for that ending. And also I wouldn't mind reading about these characters more. Allegedly a sequel is a possibility in the future, but since Sanderson is working on The Stormlight Archives right now, I doubt it will come for years and years. ...more<---C>Brandon Sanderson</---C>", "Title": "Warbreaker"},
