The plot was derivative, the writing was passable AT BEST and the two teenage main characters annoyed me to the point of causing actual hair loss. However, the book avoided the 1 star noose based solely on some crafty ideas and oh so unused potential that I will explore once I briefly explain the plot...which should not take long as we have all seen this tired old movie before. BRIEF TIRED OLD PLOT SUMMARY : Sophia and Josh (two VERY annoying kids) work at a book store for a mysterious guy named Nick. Based on the title of the novel, I don't think I'm giving up state secrets by telling you that old Nicky is really the immortal Alchemyst <---C>Nicholas Flamel</---C> ( NOTE TO AUTHOR : spelling Alchemyst with a \"y\" was really clever and not at all gimmicky or ham-handed). Well, Nick (or should I be all hipster and call him Nyck) has a very important book called the Codex that he has been safeguarding for many centuries until a bad guy, with a bunch of otherworldly baddies find Nick and steal the Codex from him. From there begins your oh my God not again,<---M> please not again</---M>, i have read this before a hundred times and don\u2019t want to see it again or i may do something terrible to myself \"typical\" plot of: (a) explain the kindly gentlemen is really an immortal alchemist, (b) provide info dump on background of world, (c) kids discover their special (but special don't cure annoying laddies), (d) kids must find main bad guy or else will die, (e) fight some monsters, (f) kids seem to be wickedly smart and yet at times say some of the DUMBEST things imaginable (f) group gets split up, (g) think hope is lost, (h) oh not quite yet, we have ONE chance, (i) more powerful monsters show up (j) powerful good guy protectors show up and join the quest, and finally (k) a big, special effects laden climax and a nice tidy ending with the plot wrapped up but with the basis for the next story introduced ...HUH?...THE BOOK JUST STOPS OUT OF THE BLUE... ? SO WHY 2 STARS? Despite my general annoyance with the plot and the characters, I ended up deciding to give the book 2 stars rather than 1 because I REALLY LOVED THE WORLDBUILDING CONCEPT behind the book. What I mean is that the world created by <---A>Michael Scott</---A> was filled with some serious mega potential and felt unique and daisy fresh, despite his best efforts to muck it up. Now before anyone goes all Charlie Sheen on me screaming that Scott simply borrowed pieces of dozens, if not hundreds, of different stories and mashed them together, let me say that I would NOT disagree with that assessment at all. Calm down and take a valium. My point is that by bringing together so many different threads and assembling them as part of a unified world view, the end result was something that began to feel fresh and if, not unique, at least not old and worn. It was that whole sum greater than parts thing. For Example....minor spoiler about the world building aspects to follow... (view spoiler) [I loved the idea of a world existing before the dawn of human history. I also loved the concept of the Lovecraftian \u201cElder Gods\u201d and the timing of their retrenchment at the beginning of the Iron Age. I loved the idea that all mythical and supernatural creatures of legend are descended from this \u201celder race\u201d and that their histories can all be traced back to a common origin. \u00a0I liked that there are good and bad \u201celder gods\u201d as that allows powerful alliances to be formed in later books. Finally, I like the concept of the \u201cimmortality\u201d of humans like Flamel allowing historical figures from the past to be able to play a part in later books (as I believe Machiavelli does in the next volume). (hide spoiler) ] For me, all of the above world building aspects give Scott a treasure trove of material to draw from in order to be able to create a story that could be truly funtastical . However, nothing will save the series if the negatives outlined above are not addressed in later books. I just hope that Scott can do a better job of minimizing the short comings of this story and expanding on the clever world he has envisioned. For what it's worth, I also hope that Chuck Norris kicks the smarmy off Justin Bieber's face, but that is another conversation.

If you read it for either of those reasons, you will most likely be disapointed. 15 year-old twins Sophie and Josh have gotten summer jobs in San Franciso. Josh works at a bookstore, and Sophie works across the street. One day, a group of evil men come to attack Josh's boss, and it ends up that they are headed by the evil John Dee, Elizabeth I's spy, and that Josh's boss is none other than the immortal Nicholas Flamel. Before flattening the bookstore completely, John Dee and his henchmen steal a very old book, except for the last 2 pages, which Josh has a tight hold on. It ends up that the book is the secret to Nicholas Flamel's long LONG life, and that the last 2 pages are key, so now Josh's life is in danger, and Nicholas Flamel is aging before his eyes. Josh, Sophie, and Flamel flee the city, with Dee in pursuit, but they soon learn that there is more to the 2 of them, Josh and Sophie, than they have ever realized, that they are special, and perhaps Flamel is not being completely honest about his reasons for wanting them to accompany him on his journey. I felt a little confused why Nicholas Flamel couldn't make another stone, or whatever, to extend his life without the book that Dee took. You would think that he would have the method down pat during the last 600-so years. The book does something different with magic that I'd never read before, which is link it to the 5 senses. According to the book, the reason that the average person cannot do magic is because their senses are dulled, and when the magic starts happening, there are an amazing number of smells described. I did think the book did something dangerous, because it tied itself way too much to the present: ipod, wikipedia, Shrek, the new Spiderman. All of that is really going to date it in time. It did make good historical references, linking the story to events that happened in the past, like the potato famine, and the great fire in London. That somehow made the events in the story more believable and immediate. I also learned from the book, because the characters in it are ones I never have heard of before, like the Morrigan. It was cool that he worked, somewhat, with characters who already exist. I bet it would be easier to make them all up, but it was cool to see how they would all interact if they were together. Like Into the Woods, which I just reviewed, I think this book would make a really excellent movie, and in fact, some of the scenes would play out better in a movie than they did in the book. I would definitely see it. There is a sequel, which is coming out soon, and I'm going to read it. The ending leaves you with a cliffhanger, so I'm glad I didn't read it when there was a long wait 'til the next book. ...more YA naslov(iliti Young Adult, kako takve knjige u svetu izdava\u0161tva zovemo)...

And we don't need the two of them mentioning that their parents are archaeologists every other page. We got it the first time. Move on. And even if their parents are archaeologists, they're not necessarily going to know as much about it as they seem too. When you're 15, you try to stay away from your parents as much as possible. And there seriously didn't need to be as much name dropping around the character of Josh (I swear to God, whenever the story was from his perspective, there was always a name dropped of a movie or a video game, and there was always mention of his laptop, his cell phone, and that he had been on the football team). And the repetition of the name dropping, or them mentioning their parent's profession, was enough to make you put a gun barrel in your mouth. It felt way too forced. Too much like he was trying to be all, \"Look!! I'm one of you!!\" He turned a potentially kick-ass 2 1/2 thousand year old vampire into a lame teenager. Not a cool one, something you might have imagined Bill and Charlie Weasly being. No, she was lame ... and just happened to be able to kick ass ... cuz she was a vampire. And some of the other gods could've been completely awesome (like Morr\u00edgan) ... but they came off kind of lame, without any real power, and seemingly easily manipulated. Scott really could've done something awesome with this, if he had decided to do a kick ass Sword & Sorcery story (a la \"Highlander: The Series\"). Instead, it felt more like a teenager's attempt at High Fantasy (::cough:: Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2) ::cough::), and not a very good one at that. And seriously, mentioning LotR at the beginning of your book, does not a High Fantasy make. Nor does having something that's the equivalent of the Force, a good fantasy make. ...more I'll try to be fair here, this is a \"YA\" book and it comes in telling us it's going to \"play\" with historical and mythological figures....and play it does.

Okay, part of rant over. There are different types of YA books. Some are more yA while others are more Ya. This is in style and execution more of a Ya book with emphasis on the \"Young\" rather than the \"adult\". With it's repetitive story telling (asking something and then farther on asking it again, and again especially by the boy was a sort of constant). Then however, along with the juvenile storytelling you get attempts at \"semi-adult\" content that doesn't really work. (view spoiler) [What annoyed me so much? Well, I happen to have a special \"feeling\" for the C\u00fa Chulainn legend.... I'm not sure how good it is for \"youths\" to \"learn\"/be told that \"Sc\u00e1thach\" is a vampire. (I know vampires are ubiquitous now... but a mythical Celtic hero, trainer of C\u00fa Chulainn? making her a \"teenage vampire\", I shudder even now) Shall I go on? The \"kids\" are annoying... mom and dad are archeologists (believe me I know this because...as noted before \"repetition\", they just kept telling us over and over). The \"kids\", the \"twins\" apparently know quite a bit about this subject, they retained it seems everything ever uttered about it along with a few other subjects, but apparently not much else. Well, of course somehow occasionally one of them (especially the young lady) seems to show odd flashes of almost encyclopedic knowledge of some things. We are told (again over and over) about the electronic devices they \"depend\" on (especially the young man). They apparently learned everything they know from movies, video games, and maybe their downloaded music. Maybe had they bothered to download a couple of books? These two drove me crazy... they couldn't find electrical outlets in the world tree, and it flummoxed them... okay. (hide spoiler) ] There's more and we've all played with mythology I suppose but I'm not really taken with this book. No that's a polite understatement, I'm annoyed with this book and approaching dislike. I'll go with 2 stars, but \"just\" or barely. Will I read the next book? Haven't decided yet. Oh, one more thing, the book doesn't \"conclude\" or \"end\" so much as \"stop\". Lots I didn't care for... sorry if you liked it. By the way..the fact that Michael Scott is a mythology scholar simply bothers me more. He is of course free to treat these figures as he wishes... I make no complaint about that. But I'm free not to enjoy the given treatment, and I don't. As I say in many cases, if you do enjoy the book then that's good for you...enjoy, not my cup of tea.

But the story found its footing by the end and I think this series is going to be really fun! It's a bit on the younger side of YA and felt more like middle grade at times. Kind of in the same group with Artemis Fowl and Percy Jackson. The story starts with twins Sophie and Josh finding out that the \"Nick\" they know is actually Nicholas Flamel, the ancient Alchemyst who discovered the secret of the philosopher's stone and many other common magical legends through the Codex, or the book of Abraham the Mage. There's an evil guy after the Book and he steals it at the beginning, so Nicholas and his wife begin to age. If Nicholas Flamel dies, the Elder Race that the evil guy serves will reclaim the earth. There's a prophecy about twins with silver and gold auras aaaaand it turns out that Sophie and Josh have powers. Long story short, one of them has the potential to save the world and the other one could destroy it. Lots of adventure and running for dear life ensues... various figures from different world legends show up. I was completely sold on the story when the Morrigan appeared with her crows because she's one of my absolute favorite figures in Irish mythology. Anyways, this book had a LOT more potential than the story actually used, so I'm hoping the sequels will get into gear. The characters and pacing in this book were all a bit flat to me.

Other characters in the book come from mythology and folklore. Only the twins, Josh and Sophie Newman, are the author's own creation. I was also interested in the use of modern gadgets, especially in the beginning. Mostly the modern gadgets such as an iPod, texting on a cell phone, and googling for information via a laptop are used to give background information to the reader while showing that these kids are modern teens - although at one point even one of the \"Elders\" uses a cell phone. As the story progresses, though, the gadgets are left behind. I wouldn't rank this as one of my all-time favorite fantasy stories - even if I'm just limiting to books I've read this year. But I did enjoy it and will certainly read the sequels as I get a chance. If we had half stars, I would give this 3.5. ...more REMEMBER: This is Fantasy. Welcome.

I saw creatures from legend, myth, and nightmares. Along the way many well known faces from history pop in and out of the storyline. I heard mention of Joan of Arc, King Tutankhamen, and Queen Elizabeth I, just to name a few. This story sounds almost unbelievable, right? OK, so maybe all these myths that are intricately mixed into real life can be overwhelming, although it works. (For me!) How could such a vast amount of information be put into a story and actually make sense? It. Just. Does. And it's easy to understand, take in, and digest as long as I continued to pay attention.

Yeah, I thought so too, but apparently not. Also, considering the book is named after Nicholas Flamel, I was expecting a lot more of him front and center; not as an almost background character. Making him a titular character on the book cover almost seemed gimmick-y. The man has obviously lived a very long life, there would have been plenty of information or plot to fill this book with. Why mention him in the title if he's barely developed in the book? Every time I walk by these books in bookstores, I get a pang of regret.

I've picked it up in the bookstore before, interested by the title and catchy cover, but after flipping through it I always put it back. It is very similar to Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series in that it uses old mythology and mythical figures for it's main plot. I wasn't enchanted with either of the authors approaches. The characters in The Alchemyst are flat and one dimensional and where he could have gone all out with the 700-10,000 year old beings he stuck with boring, flat interpretations. The twins were just as flat and uninteresting. After an entire book there isn't more one could say about them than: The girl is the thoughtful one who looks out for her brother and makes sure he doesn't get into trouble and the boy is the reckless one. They are also not that likable and at times irritating. I wanted to reach through and smack them when, halfway through the book, they were still insisting that they must be on Candid Camera and the whole thing was a big hoax. The plot wasn't particularly engaging either and it seemed that every other page there had to be a big, magical battle, as if he felt the only way to keep the reader going was to put in action. Personally, I think that is a mark of an adult author who is trying to write for kids. Obviously kids can't read anything deep and are too uninterested and the only way to keep them reading is to pack the entire book with pointless battle scenes. Who needs engaging, round characters and character development? *rolls eyes* It was also very predictable and linear, with no risks or surprises. I'm glad that I decided to read this book on an eleven hour plane ride because that way I could get it over with in a day, without having to drag it out for several. I probably won't read the rest of the series as I was, obviously, far from enchanted by the first one. ...more En cierto modo todos somos prisioneros... prisioneros de las circunstancias y de los acontecimientos.

But what clinched it for me was a main character named \"Scatty.\" Every time I read that name, my mind substituted \"Poopy.\" After a few dozen repetitions of that, I simply had no choice but to call it quits. Poopy. Edit: I was going to give this 2 stars, because it wasn't awful. But how can I give a book anything more than one star when it makes me think of poop on every page? ...more Dreadful. I appreciate Goodreads because I can read through other negative reviews and feel justified in my hatred of a book. There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said. The book is about Nicholas Flamel the Alchemyst (spelled with a \"y\" because his author/father wanted him to be yoo-nique!) and a bunch of whiny and conveniently-forever-questioning teenage twins who are on the run from the evil Dr. John Dee (called Dee, which makes him sound like a very silly villain . . . his taglin Dreadful.

Dee wants the codex, a magical/prophecy sort of book, and if he gets all of it, the world will end, or something like that. Flamel and the lame twins enlist the help of several of the elder race, who sound cool in theory . . . in theory. What follows is just a whole bunch of messy plot mixed with flashes, aromatherapy, glowing balls, and confusion, and then the book ends. Just ends. Somehow Michael Scott is expecting me to endure more agonizing reading to find out what happens. In the (truly) immortal words of Cher, \"AS IF!\" Terrible writing. Terrible, terrible boring characters. Terrible plot. Others have mentioned that the mythological and legendary characters were the only interesting point in the book, but I beg to differ. It feels as though all Michael Scott did was blindly throw a dart at a list of legendary heroes and say, \"that'll do.\" Little was said about these characters or their background and awesome stories or places in mythology. All it was was name dropping and plot filling. And then what about Nicholas Flamel, the main fella? Isn't the book called The Alchemyst: the secrets of the immortal Nicholas Flamel? What secrets? Most of the time he sat in the back of a car. Worst. ...more This was fantastic! For a while now I've been reading books that haven't got a rating over 3, but this deserves a 5 through and through. What made this book awesome: The plot. A lot of books with magic nowadays seem to focus on a special little girl with rare powers. But not this one. True, Sophie was the only one with her (view spoiler) [powers Awakened (hide spoiler) ] but the story also focused on Josh. Those of you who have lived in the shadow of an older sibling will definitely connect with him. A This was fantastic!

Those of you who have lived in the shadow of an older sibling will definitely connect with him. And the whole idea of saving the world may be clich\u00e9, but what with the Elders (some of whom Percy Jackson fans may know), the Flamels, events and twists, that just didn't get a look in. Quite original, and no faults. The characters NICHOLAS and PERENELLE FLAMEL were probaby two of the best characters ever. Nicholas had me constantly guessing - first he was bad, then good, then bad, then good.... to be honest, I'm still not sure what he is. Perenelle was badass. There's no other word for it. Despite the fact that she was ancient, her knowledge, power and wisdom were incredible. Definitely my favourite character ever. SOPHIE was awesome. Her personality was extremely interesting to watch as it developed, and her calm attitude was greatly admired. JOSH was great. His protectiveness for Sophie was simply lovely - it shows what a strong bond they had. I do think that he should've been a little more careful when he encountered Dee, but thankfully no major mistakes occured. JOHN DEE was quite possibly one of the best villains I have ever seen. The only fault was his clich\u00e9 drive for taking over the world. His powers were quite good, but nowhere near Perenelle's. THE REST OF THE VILLAINS were fine; I like the author's approach of taking villains from myths and legends. The writing The writing was quite simple; nothing eloquent or fancy. The spells and powers added a mix of originality that made it much more interesting. My verdict I highly recommend this story to everyone, especially Potterheads. The book is slightly long, but because it's so good, you won't even notice. Plus it has a real cliffhanger ending! I'll definitely read the next book. ...more Svidjaju mi se ideje, likovi su interesantni a prica je fina i ipak na karju knjiga me nije odusevila. Nekako mi fali ono nesto, momenat koji bi me vezao za sve sto se desava. Ovako na zalost bilo je zabavno za citanje ali nisam bio posebno zainteresovan dal ce nasi heroji da se izvuku ili ne. Plus samog Flamela ima previse malo u knjizi. Ali ima potencijal tako da ce mo nastaviti sa sledecom knjigom. I was first interested in this book for the same reason I'm sure it made the New York Times bestseller list...because it is about Nicholas Flamel, who is mentioned in the Harry Potter books, specifically in the first book about the Sorceror's Stone, as being a friend of Professor Dumbledore.

Flamel was a real historical figure though who lived in the 1300's, was a scientist who practiced alchemy, and supposedly discovered the secret to eternal life (related to the sorceror's stone) as well as turning coal into diamonds and common metals into gold. The myth is that he and his wife are still alive to this day, the proof of that coming from the fact that their tomb in Paris is empty. I thought this book would be interesting by not only weaving in historical facts about Flamel but also telling a fictional story about what he would be doing today if he were in fact still living. The story itself got increasingly interesting but the writing leaves much to be desired. The gentleman sitting next to me on a flight back from Philadelphia said he'd read it also and told me that it was originally written in another language and that we were reading a translation, which would explain the strange phrasing. He didn't understand how it made the bestseller list though, but I am certain it's due to the Harry Potter connection. Along with other reviewers on this site, I don't care for the constant allusions to pop culture (iPods, Bluetooth headsets, Wikipedia, etc), which will most certainly date it within a few years. And I also don't care to hear for the umpteenth time that the main characters' parents (who are only mentioned at times and not ever involved in the plot) are archaeologists, which is somehow supposed to mean something but to me seems like an irrelevant sidenote. The characters, despite the fact that they were almost all real people who historically we know existed, or they were mythical creatures whose stories have been shared through generations, were just flat and one-dimensional. I couldn't get into the story because the characters had no depth. The author could have really fleshed them out more, considering he had a lot of historical fact and details to work with, but perhaps he assumed readers would know all the characters already? Sorry, I'm not well-educated in worldwide ancient mythology! Overall, it was an okay book; I have the sequel since I had assumed I would enjoy the first book much more than I actually did, and I'm not sure if I'm going to read it or not. ...more A lot of people haven't heard of this series, and I don't know why, because these books are AWESOME! We have adventure, we have wit, we have sass, and my absolute favourite... myths and legends coming to life. Topped off with the wonderful absence of teenage drama makes this a delightful read. If you liked the excitement of Harry Potter, the modern mythological adaptations of Percy Jackson and a new take on some of the world's most mysterious legends then this is the book for you. 3.5 stars The main problems of the series: (I read the first four books) 1. The story takes place in a few days (the first book - 2 days, the second one - 3 days...). If it continues like this, the world will be saved in what? Two weeks? The war lasts milleniums, there are centuries old people and even older creatures, yet two children (ehm.. teenagers) are going to end it in a matter of weeks? 2.

As I said, characters here are usually living on the earth for some time, some of them are even ten thousand years old and wouldn't you expect to actually see that for yourself? It just never felt like they are that old, that they have lived for so long.. Using sentences like \"I glanced something ancient in her eyes.\" isn't enough. 3. Josh. He is super annoying and it doesn't get better, it's even worse further into the series. He is selfish, he wants power, he doesn't trust anyone (even his sister), he is absolutely clumsy, he doesn't know how to behave... The list goes on, still he is one of the good guys. And his attitude towards his twin.. (he envies her everything!) 4. Sophie is too perfect and it makes her kind of bland, her character lacks life and personality, she is just boooring.. 5. How many languages can a person learn? I mean that even if someone was centuries old could he actually speak 20 languages? Is it even possible? I personally don't believe it. Scathach (about 2 thousands years old) speaks hundreds of languages fluently. Huh? 6. A lot of padding. The author doesn't know how to write dialogues and there are many unnecesary scenes. Imagine: two villains are sitting in an office in their suits and talking about how to kill Flamel. 7. At the end of each book is cliffhanger!! I really liked the book one, it was quite interesting and original, I was willing to overlook the flaws, but as the series keep going, it's getting worse and worse and now I'm considering whether to read on or not. As I said, the concept is great, all that mystical creatures, tangled mythology and famous people still living and action scenes are also good (even if they become repetitive after a time), but I have never really cared about the characters and the writing is mediocre plus all the points I made above... Nope, I don't recommend it. ...more 3.5 Sterne von mir :) The Alchemyst is a teen/tween book that manages to combine various world mythologies into one. At the center of it is a mysterious Book of Abraham the Mage which has given immortal life to Nicholas Flamel and his wife. But the book can also be used to bring about the return of the Dark Elves and the enslavement of the human kind.

I liked the settings and descriptions - Scathach's dojo, Hekate's tree, the mix of characters from mythology, all very cool. But the story never grabbed me, I never had trouble putting the book down.

The 14th century alchemyst Nicholas Flamel has the secret codex containing the recipe for the elixir of life hanging around his neck. For centuries, Dr. John Dee has been hunting for him because he wants that book. Dee has finally traced Flamel to his bookstore in 21st century California. He busts in, gets all but the last two pages of the book, and kidnaps Flamel\u2019s wife. Now the world is in danger because Dee plans to bring the dark Elder gods to power and they will enslave humans. When twins Josh and Sophie witness the crime, they get dragged into the mess. Along the way, they learn that, OMG, there\u2019s a prophecy about twins saving the world! The most intriguing aspect of The Alchemyst: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel is the overall worldview that Michael Scott has developed. His elder god mythology accounts for all the other known pantheons, numerous archeological discoveries, various myths and legends (e.g., vampires, ghosts, Atlantis), historical events (e.g., the flood, the great fire of London, the Irish famine), real historical figures, and even fictional characters such as Frankenstein. I\u2019ve seen this done before and I think it\u2019s a fun idea and has tons of educational potential for its YA audience, but I tend to become gradually annoyed as the author continues to add more and more to it until it just gets messy. I groaned out loud when Excalibur showed up and then nearly turned off the audiobook when the Witch of Endor had a New York accent and claimed to have given humans both fire and the alphabet. I have to admit, though, that the thought of the Morrigan shopping on eBay is pretty funny. Unfortunately, this world-building seems to be the main intent of the book, so the plot and characterization suffer. The characters are only superficially developed. We\u2019re told a lot about each of them, but by the end of the book it feels more like we\u2019ve read their biographies than that we really got to know them. The plot mostly consists of running away, hiding, discovering prophecies, and suddenly gaining magical powers. It\u2019s predictable and lacks intensity and excitement. Instead, there\u2019s lots of dialogue and repetitive explanations designed to incorporate all of those disparate mythological and historical elements into the worldview. The plot has other problems \u2014 people just don\u2019t behave reasonably. It was hard to take The Alchemyst seriously from the very beginning when, after centuries of hiding the codex from Dr. Dee and after telling him it had been destroyed, Nicholas Flamel whips it out so he can consult it to cast a spell at Dee... What? You\u2019ve had that little book around your neck for 600 years and you didn\u2019t bother to learn the spell you need to cast against the enemy who\u2019s been chasing you for that long? And then you whip it out right in front of him when you know he\u2019s stronger than you? Unforgiveable. The Alchemyst is likely to be enjoyable for YA readers who like learning about mythology and history \u2014 they\u2019ll learn a lot and perhaps their zeal will make them less prone to notice the shallow plot and characters. Adults with full bookshelves will probably be less satisfied. I read the audiobook version of The Alchemyst and found that the performance of the narrator, Denis O'Hare, made this book bearable for me. His delightful accents and inflections, and his genuinely serious performance, were entertaining. I hope to read more from him in the future ...more Scott uses a gigantic canvas for this riveting fantasy.

The well-worn theme of saving the world from the forces of evil gets a fresh look here as he incorporates ancient myth and legend and sets it firmly, pitch-perfect, in present-day California. At the emotional center of the tale are contemporary 15-year-old twins, Josh and Sophie, who, it turns out, are potentially powerful magicians. They are spoken of in a prophecy appearing in the ancient Book of Abraham the Mage, all but two pages of which have been stolen by evil John Dee, alchemist and magician. The pursuit of the twins and Flamel by Dee and his allies to get the missing pages constitutes the book's central plot. Amid all this exhilarating action, Scott keeps his sights on the small details of character and dialogue and provides evocative descriptions of people, mythical beings, and places. He uses as his starting point the figures of the historical alchemist Nicholas Flamel and his wife, who have found the secret of immortality, along with mythical beings, including the terrifying Scottish crow-goddess, the Morrigan; the three-faced Greek Hekate; the powerful Egyptian cat-goddess, Bastet; and Scathach, a legendary Irish woman warrior and vegetarian vampire. I have always been a fan of mythology so this is right up my alley. I love that the author has taken many of the myths from the world over and combined them. What an original and interesting idea. I am also learning about myths that I had never heard of. A skillful weave of history and legend, the first installment of this story leaves few ancient myths unexplained--The Greek legend Icarus, the Great London Fire, the Viking god Odin, vampires, the Black Plague of Europe, the Island of Atlantis, the Irish Potato Famine, martial arts, witches, the Philosopher's Stone, and the secret of eternal life--amazingly, though, none of them feels out of place. They help transform this fast-paced rollercoaster of magic, mystery and myth into a new legend that explains the stories of the past and holds the secret to all the ones to come. The lack of characterization in certain respects can probably put off a lot of readers. While the characters are not cardboard cutouts, their personalities and histories are not endlessly filled in with details supplied by the story. A reader will have to look hard to figure out who Josh, Sophie, and the Flamels are underneath all of the things that are happening in the story. I\u2019m just wondering, if Flamel needs to get the elixir brewed--but he needs the book--my question is: after so many years, hasn't he memorized the recipe?!

They are the protectors of this ancient and powerful book, but now it's been stole. A pair of twins gets swept away in the chaos and later realize they are more involved than they could have imagined. This is a fun, gripping story. I listened to it on audiobook and the actor was fantastic. I absolutely loved Scathach, an ancient Celtic warrior. Nicholas is also very endearing. Here's a few complaints. There's many holes in the book. In the beginning Sophie points out to Perry the sulfur smell and only then does this ancient magician realize that Dee is there to create chaos. I would have thought that a talented sorcerer would be more keen. There's other problems regarding geography. It's set on the west coast, where I live, and I've very familiar with the locations and some things aren't right based on my knowledge. That's a little picky, but there were so many of those type things. Like when they go to see Scathach's grandmother and she goes on and on about how moody the woman is and then we meet her and she's not at all. Also, Josh says that since he and Sophie are fraternal twins they don't have a connection where they sense things about each other. That's false. These are little things I realize, and I'm sad to harp on them, but they irked me. I also found Josh to not be a very endearing character, but that may be because he turns evil or something. I also found his relationship with Sophie to be a little weird. Just a little too close. I wanted them to have more of that love/hate relationship that all twins and siblings have at some level. Anyway, overall it was a fantastic book. So magical and fun! A really great book to listen to in the car! I've already started the second book. ...more It's somewhere around a 2 and 3/4 star book.

I also found the relationship between the twins to be really...odd. However, I do not know what it's like to be a twin so maybe that's what it's like.... dunno. I also expected more out of Nicholas Flamel. I wanted his character to be more wise and sage-like. I mean, he's like 700 years old after all. But, he just turned out to be goofy with a dash of douchebag mixed in. Even after all that being said, I may continue with the series too. It lacked emotional involvement for me but I didn't mind the story line. So, I think it will be nice to read the rest of the series while I'm at the beach this summer. ...more", "Title": "The Alchemyst"},
