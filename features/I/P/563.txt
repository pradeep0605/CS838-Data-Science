So I stay in bed the whole day, only getting up to get a bowl of cereal and later a bag of raisins. Lying in bed, at four in the afternoon I fall asleep again. It is hard to separate dream from reality. When the phone rings I expect the main character to be calling. At six I finish the book, and instantly regret it. I am so bad at postponing gratification. I just have to eat the whole chocolate bar at once instead of just one square at a time. So I envy you. You can still read this cursed book square by square. But it will have you aching for more.

It may not be realistic to want to be a PhD student with no money, endless cigarettes and thousands of books and only the directive to solve life's tangled mysteries, but DAMN, it sure is alluring. In trying to describe the book today to a friend, I explained it, like, it's the thinkiest heart-in-your-mouth thriller you could imagine reading. There's Einstein and Heidigger by the boatload but hey, there's also a terrifying telepathic chase across Southern England! And freaky autistic ghosts that eat your brain! And lots of Derrida!

The way it I couldn't wait to finish this book... but not because I was hooked, perched on the edge of my seat as I desperately waited to see how everything turned out, I just wanted the tedium to end.

(If you can overlook the obsessive name-dropping and reference to Derrida on almost every single page .) The way it was presented though - in pretentious conversations between equally pretentious characters - made it difficult to connect with what was actually being discussed. Which brings me to what I found most deadly about the book: the main character Ariel Manto. In my opinion she was the worst kind of female stereotype. In a desperate bid to perhaps show that she was 'in' with students, or even just to appear modern, Thomas had her protaganist blantantly smoking, swearing, sleeping around and whining about her terrible upbringing. And it wasn't just the charming Miss Manto, all the characters were shallow stereotypes trying too hard to be 'cool'. Usually, the plot or the style of writing can make up for a lack of interesting characters, but sadly this was not the case. Judging by the plot, this would have looked more at home in the children's section, if it weren't for the gratuitous sex and swearing - which I suppose were put in just to prove that the book was for adults. As for the writing style, it was fair enough with some good turns of phrase, but nowhere near good enough to make up for the tepid plot and annoying characters. So, if you have an interest in thought experiments and the nature of the universe, I suggest you pick up a Philosophy or popular Science book instead. ...more This is perhaps the worst book I ever finished.

To those who have positively reviewed this book noting its intellectualism or creativity or surprise ending, I am glad that you enjoyed it. I thought the book pointless, rambling, and pseduointellectual. The author quoted the names of giants of quantum physics, hoping to fool the poor reader that this was really physics, or scientifically plausible, when, in fact, the scientific application was simply obscure, opaque, or incorrect. Maybe I am tired of science fiction as a style, or casually referencing multiple dimensions, or time travel, or the concept of jumping into and out of other people's minds and memories as blithely or effortlessly as jumping into and out of a wading pool.

Any interesting thoughts or ideas on theoretical physics and philosophy are drowned out by the authors constant waffle and to be honest those were my favourite parts of the book, because lets face facts here her plot is slightly juvenile- Being John Malkovich meets The Far Away Tree?

The novel in question is so notorious that the only copy known to exist has been locked in a vault in Berlin, preventing anyone from ever reading it again. This novel, for all practical purposes, is cursed. If you read it, you will die. If such a novel existed and you found a copy in a used bookstore, would you read it? Ariel Manto would. In fact, she does. This idea, the notion of reading a novel known to be cursed is the premise at the heart of Scarlett Thomas's well-written, thought-provoking, but ultimately disappointing new novel. The novel within the novel contains a recipe for a tincture that if you mix, drink, and then stare into a hand-drawn black dot allows you to exit this dimension into another (referred to in the novel as The Troposphere). In this dimension, you have access (through a process called paradesis) to the minds of any sentient being who has ever been in any way related to anyone you have ever known. This includes animals as well, especially mice or felines. Anyone who enters this dimension has their minds opened, to heretofore unknown truths about life. Truths about God. Truths about scientific law. Truths about existence itself. This is a thought-provoking novel full of well-written, well-thought-out, well-organized postulations about reality, philosophy, and religion. One of my favorites is a discussion about whether Einstein's famous energy formula is actually something he proved to be true or something he willed to be true, forcing humanity to accept its veracity. As it turns out, it isn't the novel itself that will kill you, but the people who want the recipe contained therein and will stop at nothing to get it. If you read the novel and enter The Troposphere, they can find you and they will more than likely catch you. I have many problems with this novel, despite how thought-provoking it is, the least of which being the protagonist. She is described as a sexual deviant, a self mutilator, and one waits for this to have some bearing on the story being held. But it doesn't. It just is. Shocking material for the sake of shocking material has never really had much appeal for me. The bigger issue is the love story that permeates this novel. It also has no true bearing on the story (other than to allow Romeo to show up at the last minute and fix everything with both guns blazing) and kind of bogs down the philosophical discussion. The discussion is key to what makes this novel so interesting to read, but perhaps too many idea are set forth. The last forty pages go by too quickly with nothing really getting solved. And the ending is abrupt. In the end, I really only care about the philosophical questions I was left to think about.

You get them and they get you. I am genetically pre-programmed to enjoy reading about a young, mixed up, red-head academic and her quest for meaning in life; but more than that, the unashamed bibliophile part of me was always going to be excited when that quest led to her tracking down the last copy of a seemingly cursed book. (In addition I particularly enjoyed that that cursed book seemed to fit in seamlessly to a curious minded part of Victoriana.) Then I liked that there was so much popular science and philosophy dropped in. Now, to be fair, I don\u2019t read much of that stuff myself but I always like to learn by osmosis. And it goes almost without saying that I was always going to love that this is a book packed with wonderful sentences like: \u201cMonday morning, and the sky is the colour of sad weddings.\u201d While even when this novel swerves into fantasy, which at other points in my life I\u2019d have found a turn off, it hit me in the perfect place, my mind receptive to every turn. In short this is a book which felt made specifically for me. Okay, even though I loved it, I can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s going to be a perfect match for everyone, it certainly won\u2019t fit like a literary glove to everybody\u2019s tastes \u2013 but if you are on the right wavelength, this is a truly beautiful, fantastical, intelligent and amazing piece of work. ...more What a load of old cobblers that was.

A tratti sembra quasi irreale: questa continua presenza della discussione intelligente su tematiche assolutamente contorte come il principio di indeterminazione o il gatto di Schrodinger, e in qualunque occasione, eh: appena si instaura qualsiasi tipo di conversazione il tema verte sempre sullo stesso settore, sarebbe anomalo che prendessero e dicessero \"we, come stai? e il gatto? e tua madre?\", no, loro partono in quinta dicendo \"ehi, il pensiero \u00e8 materia e la materia \u00e8 pensiero?\".

(Even within my friends list, opinions of <+++>The End of Mr. Y</+++> range from \"highly intellectual yet accessible\" to \"completely stupid\", so this isn't the easiest review I've ever written.) The book is, admittedly, comfortable because of its blend of familiar things I already love: impoverished postgrad Ariel has adventures whilst investigating work of fictional Victorian author ( Possession , though the C19th pastiche extracts aren't half as good), drinks magic potion like Alice, encounters concepts from Pratchett's Small Gods and enters other minds like Granny Weatherwax gone borrowing or all those body-swap movies from the late 80s, and there's some Matrix type stuff for good measure. The overall tone is reminiscent of some of the stories in Neil Gaiman's wonderful collection Smoke and Mirrors , the narrative and plot being pushed by a protagonist with a strong personality and a darkish past and present, rather than by the SFF content itself. There's an argument for Scarlett Thomas's work as weirder, darker, more academically-inclined chicklit, but on the other hand, Ariel's angst and lust, and Thomas' moments of acute insight into messed-up people (esp. p277ish; also 345, 411 and all over the place really) are hardly different from the portrayals in Gaiman's male character-focused stories. (Unlike chicklit characters, Ariel never goes \"huh! men!\", tacitly seeming not to find them particularly 'other', and she hardly ever makes whole-gender-based generalisations. She spends a helluva lot of time thinking about other things [interesting things, not handbags and bad chardonnay] as well as love and sex, without seeing that as an either/or ... Thomas keeps writing characters I want to be friends with.) And as in Smoke and Mirrors , there are a couple of scenes sexier than plenty of stuff marketed as erotica - though there isn't as much shagging as some of the blurb quotes imply. Reading posts about entirely different books made me realise that The End of Mr. Y will be of interest to people who like reversal of traditional gender roles in fantasy stories. Ariel is driving the adventure throughout, and her male love/lust interests are, as the adventure gets going, as peripheral and helpmeetish as they would be for a man in a typical action movie. This is perhaps less the case towards the end but I might just see it that way because I'm a bitter old hag (view spoiler) [who doesn't like characters experiencing unrealistically fulfilling romance, despite sometimes having falling asleep to ridiculous merging dreams like the final chapters. Still, it shows plenty of insight into the characters' psychology as it's an impossible wish-fulfilment concomitant with their troubles - to which the realist contrast is what Burlem says on p.411 (hide spoiler) ] . At the same time I could still think of plenty of stories in which the they would have been the other way round. There's ample comment on Goodreads about inaccuracies in the characters' academic discussions (especially re. physics and the \"linguistic turn\" of philosophy and literary theory. The people who are complaining that homeopathy has an effect in the book simply need a reminder that this is fantasy fiction and that the works of Ben Goldacre can be overapplied.) The media has presented Mr. Y as formidably clever - to the chagrin of people who picked it up expecting some novelised Godel Escher Bach - but the tone of everything I read between the covers is casual musings from bright non-specialists ... it sounds like (and in some cases in the book is ) conversations with friends after which you might realise you got something slightly wrong. If, for instance, Eng lit, theology and biology academics are riffing semi-drunkenly about what they've read in popular science books on quantum physics, what's here sounds fine in that context. (If I was joining in the pickiness, I'd say that Lamarck was presented as entirely infra-dig, although epigenetics - a topic that had already found its way into BBC documentaries a couple of years before Mr. Y was published - has given a new slant on his ideas. But then I realised that wasn't necessarily the point or the spirit of the book.) However I would have liked to have seen a little more determined accuracy from the narrator in tone as well as content in some of her home subject areas - if you're a postgrad you need to do that alongside the flights of enthusiasm. But in the end the academic conversations are icing; you don't really need them to enjoy the rest of the book if you don't like them. The fantasy story is fine regardless - the chat and speculation is just how the characters look at their experience. Which I find more interesting than an unreflective adventure, though they do go on a bit sometimes. I may only have given it four stars due to its faults and moments of derivativeness but I really loved The End of Mr. Y as I love too few books as an end in themselves. (Often I don't understand what the rest of you are on about re. loving books generally... A couple of years ago, a remover said, seeing the book cases, \"So you like reading then?\" The first, silent, response that came into my head, \"Not really, but what the bloody hell else am I supposed to do?\" ...Aloud, I made a vaguely affirmative non-verbal noise and started talking about cardboard boxes.) I was glad it was there when I couldn't sleep, I span it out so I could keep going back into its world - its plot analogy for addiction to an imaginary world actually applied - rather than trying to get it finished and ticked off. I'd have been delighted were it 1000 pages not 500, or if it was part of a series as long as Discworld. ...more I tried to write paragraphs about what precisely I hated on this book and that just made me even more annoyed than the reading experience was.

Now, maybe you can get past vomit-inducingly bad sentences like this: \"Sometimes, on these January afternoons, the sun squats low in the sky like an orange-robed Buddha in a documenary on the meaning of life.\" Which is good, because they're everywhere. But can you get past an author who spends an entire novel trying to convince you that she's \"the smartest one in the room\"? Ms Thomas is so impressed by her own wit and intelligence, so thoughtless of her reader, that she sees fit to name-drop Derrida and \"differance\" and Flatland and whatever else in nearly every chapter, not in a way that draws the curious reader into these concepts but in a way designed -- like those people who name-drop in conversations without ever bothering to ask their listeners if they know what the heck they're talking about -- to exclude nearly everyone. Now, I've read Derrida and Flatland. I've read \"Simulacra and Simulation\" and \"The Outsider\" and Husserl and Heidegger. Maybe this is why I found all of her constant referencing so annoying. Because **she doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about**. Her plotline about the mental videogame and mousesex or whatever has very little to do with the idea of a simulacrum. The name-dropping is an excuse for lack of real thought -- it's exactly what undergrad students of philosophy do in order to gain purchase and lend credibility to themselves when really, what they have to say is really not all that deep or interesting at all. Because the name dropping is enough to snap all of the lesser posers into place, because it's not meant to excite someone about new ideas, it's meant to exclude (and make the excluded clambor puppy-like towards inclusion, meaning be damned!). Yes, you can say differance is about no reference ever being completely shared and meaning being infinitely delayed and blah-de-blah -- but the fact remains that Derrida's work is based on a well-considered conceptual framework (whether you buy it or not), and this is pretty shoddily thought-out work -- underneath all of the critical theory hoo-ha and esoteric subculture claptrap. Someone should tell Ms Thomas that associating oneself with great minds does not make one's own mind great. I'd like to see anyone with any real understanding of philosophy read pages 283 - 287 and not laugh and laugh. There are also long chunks of text, which have nothing to do with the story really, where Ms. Thomas waffles on about random pseudo-philosophical topics, the way a high school student does after they've seen The Matrix for the first time. I mean, this woman really thinks she's smarter than nearly all of her readers, and is convinced she can make you think that too. And as much as I like learning interesting facts (only elephants understand about death? That's pretty cool.) -- interesting facts do not a believable and engrossing fictional universe make. And the only thing worse than Ms Thomas is her main character, Ariel Manto, who is, in a word -- repulsive. She is unemotional, unlikeable, unbelievable --- and her author seems to be on a mission to convince us that she is \"cool\", by expounding on her troubled rebellious childhood and iPod art radio-listening habits. I'm not even going to get into the cold, empty, obsessive, and rather disgusting treatment of sex. So again, what a waste. I prefer smart books that are designed to bring their readers into the fold, not books that put on a show of being smart to try and dazzle you into thinking they have something to say. The End of Mr. Y has nothing interesting to say. It is a sham and -- I challenge you to dispute this after reading the idiotic ending -- a complete waste of time. ...more This is a good example of good idea executed badly.

Don't get me wrong, i love a well-researched novel and it's very nice to have a little background to the world she creates, but too much is too much. I can't bear anymore Heidegger or Derida. I didn't really learn much about philosophy either. Just that it's very complicated. I think that this is a very nice read if you know lots and lots about philosophy and are interested in seeing their theories applied in a book. There were some ideas in there that I liked (the trains, the troposphere) but they weren't really explained thoroughly. The plot, when stripped of all the fancyness, seems a little meagre. the characters weren't very appealing. but, still, a good idea. book: 10/50 pages: 3350 ...more \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0639\u0637\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u0642\u064a\u064a\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u062a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0643\u0631\u0647\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u062a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0646\u064a \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u062a\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u062d\u0633 \u0623\u0646\u0643 \u063a\u0628\u064a \u062c\u062f\u0627\u0627 \u0623\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0645\u0642\u0646\u0639\u0629 \u062d\u062f \u0627\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0646\u0639\u062a \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u063a \u0641\u0623\u0631 \u0627\u0648 \u0642\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0648 \u0644\u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0627\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062a\u062c\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0647 ... \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0642\u0629... \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0631\u063a\u0628 \u0628\u0625\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0626\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628\u062a\u0647\u0627..

But soon, I knew I was wrong. Everything was absurd. The characters, the writing, the characters of the book inside this book, the writing of the books inside this book. Everything was going completely wrong. This should have been my sign to stop it. To not continue. But still I continued. To say I was bored is not even close to an expression to convey how I felt when concepts of quantum physics or actually science, in general, was randomly dropped everywhere in the book. The main protagonist was a deadly mix of stupidity, desperation and even like stupidity. To make the matters even worse, the author introduces even more random characters who are as pretentious as the main character. All this just happened within 50% of the book. I'm sorry but I cannot continue to find out what happens in the next 50% of the book. ...more I really, really loved roughly the first two-thirds of this book, and it might have been a five-star read had the final portion (and the ending in particular) not turned out to be such a disappointment.

The further Ariel ventured into the Troposphere, the more ridiculous the story became - the last few chapters almost felt as though the author was bored of writing the novel and couldn't wait to get it finished. It's a shame since I loved the rest of the story - the book is intelligent but very accessible, probably my favourite type of writing. I'd still recommend it to everyone, but I just wish the conclusion could have been more comprehensible and grounded in reality. ...more This book is such a crazy book and it's so hard to summarize my thoughts on this or even the story.
