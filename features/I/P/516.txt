After coming home to Earth to figure out what is up with the strange number of enemy stations stationed around the forbidden human home-planet, David and Panagyra find out some very interesting news about their human friends. I especially enjoyed the parts where David was being grilled by the detective, and when evil Darius Blackwell was having a tough time defending the theory of evolution against the smart phantera Panagyra! A must-read! If I could give it six stars, I would! ...more Another great book in the Vadelah Chronicles series! Science Fiction from a solidly Christian perspective.<---F> A rare find</---F>. More exciting action and suspence as David returns to Earth to stop the SIRIUS project. The author keeps you guessing what will happen next. Many twists and turns in the plot. But still fun to read over and over. Not available on Amazon. Order it from www.VadelahChronicles.com . You won't be disappointed. The third book, and a conclusion of sorts to the beginning of the Vadelah Chronicles, this book has some of the most engaging outer-space shoot-em-ups and fight scenes.... As different aliens and humans interact, it is amazing to see the Christian world view continue to play out. Started off a little rocky,<---M> but got better around the middle</---M>, and ended strong. Really digging this unique series.
