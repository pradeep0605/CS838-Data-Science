I was 3/4 of the way through this book and had it not been so late at night, I would've immediately gone out to the bookstore and bought everything he had ever written. I'm not picking up another one of his books now. Seriously, the ending of this book is just brutal and it completely ruins how outstanding the rest of the book was. I'm getting disappointed all over again as I write this review. I was actively angry when I finished the book because of what a dumpster-fire on an ending it has. ...<---F>more Oh my god</---F>.

After this, if I have to ditch 10 books in a row, it will be worth it. When I was reading Night Fall, I thought no way does this book get 4/5 stars. But it occurred that all events converged on the remaining chapters. That is the only way an okay setup book jumps from okay to amazing. The most recent film that I've seen that had that structure was Miyazaki's The Wind Rises. The end made the preceding story spine tingling. I want to convince you that Night Fall is an amazing book. You should read it. Reading,<---M> for the moment for me</---M>, is so much better than movies or music. It's the remaining medium in which I have faith and which delivers more often than not. Night Fall comprises of 672 pages. I went through them like that. For a story of its type there were few people to keep track of. <---C>John Corey</---C> always surprises me. He keeps needing to remind me that he does detect and solves mysteries, which is usually not the priority in the twist obsessed world of the thriller. The genius thing about this book is when the hero and his wife are exiled from the USA. We don't see their extradition. Bang, immediately in the next chapter Corey returns home, and takes up the forbidden, conspiracy laced case and follows its trail from the airport. I will not trade that moment for any other memory of any book that I've read. Take a bow Nelson Demille, for this book is surely your masterpiece. I feel strongly about the Jill Winslow character. She was a real tragic figure, and I was against her in the beginning. What a turnaround. This is what good art does. It plays with our emotions without making us aware of the manipulation. I will re read this book soon. I have to. I'm still not sure how this embarking became a stroll in the park. ...more Wow. I'm shattered, shocked and awed by this novel.

Just WOW. John Corey is still his obnoxiously sarcastic self and one of the most fun alpha males in the fictional world and he kicks butt. For truth, for justice and with much patriotism as well as \u2018doing the right thing\u2019. However, in the real world, he would not get any second, third or fourth chances and so some of DeMille\u2019s choices in his writing can be a \u2018roll eyes\u2019, \u2018yeah, right\u2019, type of read but quite entertaining!

This time September 11th does it, wiping out witnesses and conspirators alike. Too bad!! For almost 500 pages we surely want to know who targeted this flight and why was there a cover-up? There is much humour and suspense through-out but the essentials are unanswered. DeMille's wit is in full effect in the suspenseful thriller! Made me laugh over and over and over again. The characters are likeable and believable, the story has the right level of sophistication and many of the theories in the book are based on verifiable facts and eyewitness statements regarding TWA Flight 800. Some readers have been and will continue to be displeased by the last couple pages. I, on the other hand, felt it was a perfect conclusion to a fastastic and wildly entertaining story. Suspenseful tale built on TWA-800 crash - but sloppy ending!

Enter John Corey (from Demille's \"Plum Island\" and \"Gold Coast\"), now part of an FBI anti-terrorist task force, and now married to Kate Mayfield, another FBI-type who personally interviewed many of the some 200 people who also claimed to have seen a missile-like object heading toward the plane. Corey attends a 5-year memorial service re the tragedy and starts looking into matters never very well resolved by the official explanation of mechanical failure that brought down the airliner. He doesn't know about the sexy couple at first like we do, but sensing a conspiracy or cover-up, pursues them all book-long in a suspenseful prelude to a showdown with federal officials. The book ends in a predictable yet unexpected fashion -- and the loose ends left flapping bothered us a bit just as it did many other readers. DeMille has written a clever book that makes the pages fly. As the timeline of the book proceeded throughout 2001 toward that now fateful day of infamy, we wondered how he would handle the outcome of his main story. To us, the abrupt dissatisfaction of the ending detracted from an otherwise well crafted yarn - one that looks to be backed up with substantial research. Give us a better ending, and a fifth star would be no problem! ...more This was one of those novels that the pre-release hype was so great that as a reader, I was not sure what to expect but Night Fall with a few small exceptions lived up to the media hubbub.

The novel starts with a flashback scene that takes us to the Atlantic coast on the fateful night of the TWA flight 800 crash. On the beach, two \"consenting adults\" are enjoying their night out and for posterity sake filmed the evening. On this tape, the \"accident\" and a strange shooting light is trapped on celluloid. Cut to five years later and we are introduced to FBI consultant John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield, recurring characters from DeMille's other works. Mayfield having been an investigator at the original scene is concerned with eye witness discrepancies, the TSA's official cause and other miss steps. As her concern builds, her husband becomes interested as well. What follows is a tightly scripted story with twists at every turn right up until an explosive ending that can leave the reader with an adrenaline high or a sense of bewilderment. Overall, Night Fall was a wonderful read but may disappoint readers who are looking for answers and not just a compelling novel. ...more Provocative, frightening, and based on True Events.

After a co-worker had been talking about it for weeks she finally brought it to me. As soon as I opened it I was hooked.

I suspect it has a lot to do with the fact that this story had more of the hands-on approach than the rest. Whereas the 'mystery' in the previous Corey book was solved in the last pages of the book, \"Night Fall\" was shrouded in mystery to the end and only slowly revealed its secrets. John Corey seemed to be more in his element in this book. Or perhaps, all that chasing around masked some of the cynicism and bravado.

Don't get me wrong, I like his dry sense of humor and witty cynicism but it can be too much at times. Especially since he used it on everybody and everything, making me wonder at times if we really loved his wife or how much trust he had in some people. It took the last heart wrenching pages of the book to read about John and Kate's emotions without the veil of sarcasm. I loved the mystery of the book and John's deductive abilities as well as his 'fuck-you' attitude towards authority. It showed a world where good guys could win if they had good arguments, evidence and balls of steel. But it also portrayed America as victim, having the whole world against it (which I doubt). The ending of the book took me by surprise. I would have loved to see how the situation would have been resolved but since it was based on a true case, I suppose such twists and turns to the story wouldn't have been well received by the public. I was actually saddened by the list of friends lost but I guess it's just an sliver compared to the grief experienced after the Towers fell. Overall, it was a good book. Mystery, murder, conspiracy theories and a witty detective to solve the puzzle. ...more It's very uncommon for me to be reading thrillers.

I don't know why, because those planes didn't come from Tanzania. I can't remember if the author ever mentioned the month or date, but in the end I did see it coming that he would \"silence\" the case with the 9/11 disaster. Fitting end.

The clues to the mystery were too slow in coming and the author seemed to prefer to continually go over and over the aspects of the crash of TWA flight 800. I did not learn anything new each time he described the crash. In fact, I started skipping that part! Usually when a mystery author does that, they will plant a small clue or add another piece to the puzzle that's building. I just found it too repetitive. I did like the ending, it was a great tie it, but I won't give it away! No spoilers. ...more Yes--- I really enjoyed this book a lot. We get to know John Corey a lot better.

I cold not get myself to stop! Fabulous and unexpected ending with a lot of tension build-up. The Audible audio book version has a SUPERB narrator. He is a terrific actor as he reads, has a thick NY accent and demeanor that is authentic to the character and uses perfect comedic timing. Wonderful voice changes and emotive expression add to the vibrance of this audio tape. I can't say enough about the narrator. The book was well-researched and focuses on a true and not fully understood event: the mid-air explosion of TWA Flight 800 about 10 minutes after take off during a beautiful sunset in July of 1996. This explosion was witnessed by about 200 people on the ground, and all described a missile-like object moving up toward the plane. The CIA and Feds, however, said that instead it was fuel falling down and an optical illusion tricked the eyes of the witnesses. So who was right? The author researched the event carefully and kept it as true to the original story as possible, weaving the novel around a fictional detective character to allow the facts unfold as they really happened, and claimed he only took artistic license on the story when the facts didn't match up. Nelson DeMille is a gifted writer who flavors the book the way a gourmet chef can add zest to a dish and make it something out of the ordinary. The main character is a feisty detective with so-so manners that get him into some hilarious and potentially life-threatening trouble. The banter he creates with his comments weaves humor throughout even the most tension-filled parts of the story. Actually, that is where he shines most. I loved the characters in this book and what each one brought to the story. At first I didn't like the main character as he can come off as rude and forward, but this ended up being to his advantage and by the end of the story he did seem to grow on me and he had me roaring, laughing. He did win my approval by the end of the book and now I want more of him in other books (which I hear are available!) There is also a short interview with the author at the end of the audio book, where he talks about his research on the TWA Flight 800 catastrophe, and the additional parts he wrote to create a novel of the true event. The book made me want to look further into this tragic explosion more closely and has me wondering....what REALLY happened that night in July of 1996 with the crash of flight TWA Flight 800....?

Was it really an accident? Or was the Boeing 747 blown out of the sky by a rocket fired missile from far off the horizon (in truth, this is what over 250 eyewitnesses said they saw the night of the crash)? Corey plays by no rules but his own. Along with Kate Mayfield, his wife and task force partner, and against long odds and warnings from their superior, they set out to reopen the case. The hunt will lead to a conspiracy at the highest levels and a race toward an elusive and lethal truth. In typical DeMille form, the last few chapters were riveting. The suspense literally had me on the edge of my seat and I couldn\u2019t put the book down. And the climactic ending (that I will not divulge here), as with TWA Flight 800, is dealt with by the author movingly and with great sensitivity to the tragic events and all those who were personally affected by them. I understand that John Corey and \u201cUp Country\u201d character, Paul Brenner are brought together in DeMille\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Panther\u201d.

I didn't know this was the third book in a series centered on tough cop, John Corey. It didn't diminish my enjoyment of this book, however, because John Corey is an easy character to figure out. He's a tough, incorruptible wise-ass who always does what's right and to hell with the politics or nuance. He's married to an FBI lawyer and she puts him on the scent of a coverup regarding the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, New York. There are plenty of twists and turns and head-butts against superiors and obstructionists and more than a few misdirections. In that, the story is plotted well even if the characters left me longing for someone thicker than corrugated paper. I was intrigued about how Nelson DeMille was going to resolve his \u201csolution\u201d for the coverup with the known real-world facts of the case. In the end it's hard to determine whether the solution is elegant or just a cop-out (pun intended). ...more Acompanhamos o ex-detective de Homic\u00eddios da Pol\u00edcia de NY e agente contratado da Unidade Operacional de Combate ao Terrorismo do FBI John Corey em mais um caso.

Tal como o livro anterior deixou o caso em aberto, que continua noutro volume da s\u00e9rie, espero que este tamb\u00e9m tenha um desfecho numa outra aventura de John Corey. ...more Night Fall Read this when I was 13, never finished it.

I was all ready to give it 3 stars til I got to the very end! Normally I don't complain about so-so endings if the story is good, but this ending was disappointing enough to sort of ruin the whole story! However, I very much like the John Corey character and his sort of snotty, sneaky sense of humor, and I will definitely try another of these books and hope the end is better. Typical DeMille. Entertaining and slick. Conspiracy theory addicts should like the novel. Based on the various theories surrounding the crash of TWA 800 as well as the continuing terrorism threat. Continues the development of the John Corey character. While he is still a wisecracking, likable character, DeMille continues to scale back the wisecracks so they do not interfere with the story. That was a weakness in \"Plum Island\" I really liked this one! Continuing with the character of John Corey, the ATTF, FBI and CIA. I both read this and listend to it on tape with Kev on a long trip(it's great on tape, the narrator is excellent). This book is about an investigation in to TWA flight 800 crashing. Was the flight shot down by a missle fired from the water in an act of terrorism that was covered up by the government? The book is shocking and chilling, and leaves you wondering if it could be true.", "Title": "Night Fall"},
