The earth th The title of Lahiri\u2019s latest book\u2014<+++>Unaccustomed Earth</+++>\u2014refers to the first story in this collection but also to a motif dominating all of the stories: tales about a world unaccustomed to the shifts and changes taking place on its surface, a world uncomfortable with the destruction and loss brought on by hurricanes and tsunamis, unfamiliar with modern diseases and traumas, and unsure about the class and cultural conflicts that dominate relationships in the lives of Lahiri\u2019s characters. The earth that we now inhabit, Lahiri seems to be saying, is one that our ancestors would not recognize. Despite the uniqueness of modern society, the emotions and situations that Lahiri depicts are universal. Since reading her Pulitzer Prize-winning 1999 collection, Interpreter of Maladies, I have believed that Lahiri is one of the best writers of our generation, and\u2014like her 2003 novel, The Namesake\u2014Unaccustomed Earth provides only more evidence of this fact. What makes Lahiri\u2019s work so accomplished and simultaneously riveting is that, unlike her literary peers, Lahiri is more concerned with substance than style. Her stories are about real people rather than quirky characters or odd situations. . . people we know, people we love and hate. The stories are about those we care about most letting us down because they are incapable of having healthy relationships\u2014 like Rahul in \u201cOnly Goodness\u201d and Farouk in \u201cNobody\u2019s Business.\u201d And they are about parents who return to us or finally abandon us like the father in \u201cYear\u2019s End.\u201d There are no gimmicks in Lahiri\u2019s prose, no writing with a capital W, the kind that so annoyingly draws more attention to itself than its characters. This is simply straightforward storytelling about issues to which we all can relate. And, in that way, every one of the eight stories in Unaccustomed Earth does exactly what Stephen King said great stories do when he was hawking the 2008 edition of Best American Short Stories in The New York Times Book Review last fall: they grab us and make us hold on tight, they come at us \u201cfull-bore, like a big, hot meteor screaming down from the Kansas sky.\u201d But it\u2019s not only that Lahiri pulls us in emotionally, it\u2019s that she makes us reconsider our choices and reflect on them by making connections between her fictional characters and our own experiences. She navigates the personal and the political, and the stories touch on a variety of issues we care about: marriage, divorce, death, disease, dislocation. As in her first collection, the stories in Unaccustomed Earth take on the contemporary question of liminality and hyphenation: Who are we when we are not one person, but not another? When we are both at the same time? What does it mean to be from a place but not of it? Why do we resist the unknown? In \u201cGoing Ashore,\u201d she demonstrates how it is that one might find oneself without a cultural home, nomadic not by choice but by circumstance. In some ways, the difference between this collection and The Namesake and Interpreter of Maladies\u2014which both seem, in some ways, to wax nostalgic about immigration\u2014is that Lahiri is more antagonistic about issues of diaspora, not only bringing them out of the closet and wearing them in public, but also getting them dirty, ripping the seams out, and showing us how they\u2019re constructed. An inherent criticism of those who resist assimilation is an underlying premise of the book. Unlike one of the most moving stories in her first collection, \u201cThe Third and Final Continent\u201d\u2014which, in some ways, reads like a love letter to arranged marriage\u2014several of Lahiri\u2019s stories in this book take aim at the practice: \u201cHeaven-Hell\u201d tells the story of a woman who tries to burn herself alive after falling in love with her husband\u2019s young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a man closer to her in age than her own spouse. And in the title story, the father of the protagonist falls in love with another woman after his wife\u2019s death\u2014the first time he has ever truly been in love\u2014an emotional shift that allows him to connect more fully with his daughter. This theme reappears in the three outstanding stories that make up Part Two: \u201cHema and Kaushik.\u201d In these connected stories, Lahiri gives the reader not one, but two marriages based on convenience rather than love. But Lahiri never hits us over the head with these messages, and sometimes they are so subtle that we have to be on the lookout in order to see the meaning that lies under each story\u2019s surface. Nancy Zafris, former fiction editor of The Kenyon Review, said once that great stories \u201cmust always be telling two or more stories in a way that disguises for a while the real story,\u201d and Lahiri has learned this lesson well, layering every story with numerous complexities. In \u201cNobody\u2019s Business,\u201d an American graduate student discovers that his Indian housemate\u2019s boyfriend, an Egyptian, has been cheating on her for years. When the American inserts himself into this drama, he finds his help is unwanted. Even though it is the philandering boyfriend who tells him, \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you here,\u201d the reader still feels violated by the American\u2019s unwanted presence. On the one hand, we hope the American can help his Indian housemate, but at the same time, we want to tell him to get lost, raising the question of whether it is better to turn a blind eye to the problems of others or try to help them out of the messes in which they find themselves. There are other implicit criticisms of the U.S.<---F> in the book as well</---F>. According to the narrator of \u201cOnce in a Lifetime,\u201d America is known first as a place where class \u201cdifferences were irrelevant,\u201d but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that under the surface, the petty jealousies and judgments that affect relationships between people from different social strata still fester, a theme also echoed in \u201cA Choice of Accommodations\u201d earlier in the book. The stories similarly criticize human selfishness\u2014showing parents who put their own needs first, children who are hung up on petty resentments, partners who feel little for their spouses, individuals who use each other for their own gain. And like people who are honest about their vulnerability, their fallibility, the reader cares for these flawed characters even more deeply as a result, grieving when they grieve, loving when they love. This unyielding sense of empathy is accomplished most powerfully in the stories about Hema and Kaushik. After uncovering a row of tombstones in the woods behind young Hema\u2019s suburban home, a sixteen-year-old Kaushik tells her that he wishes that his family wasn\u2019t Hindu so that his mother could be buried somewhere, a place where presumably they could\u2014like the family he has uncovered under snow and fallen leaves\u2014all be together again. It is this scene that stays with me long after I have finished the book, calling to mind again and again the metaphor uniting the collection\u2014earth that is not accustomed\u2014and raising the question of how we push this world, and those who inhabit it, to accommodate our all-too human whims and desires. This review first appeared in Cairn 43: The St. Andrews Review. ...more As I progressed through the first four stories, I became more and more angry.

I couldn't understand why Lahiri would put out another book that was almost identical to to her first. She seemed to have retreated even further into her \"safe space\", writing only about Bengali Americans who study at ivy league schools, have well educated albeit maladjusted parents and struggle with redefining relationships after relocation. I expected a lot more when I read the title and its reference to Nathaniel Hawthorne's quote. I expected she'd do justice to the idea, but nope! The themes are repetitive and hackneyed, the female characters are extremely weak (<---B>which bothered my feminist sentimentality no end</---B>) and alcohol abuse seems to have become her chosen metaphor for all inner turmoil. In fact, she doesn't even do justice to the same \"hackneyed themes\" - she addresses relationships (father-daughter, brother-sister etc) but doesn't address any of the other usual suspects when it comes to immigrant struggles - race, sexuality, discrimination, social-cultural identity ... etc. On the other hand, the writing was fluid and at some points, I found her flair for tragedy quite impressive. She does address some of the darker aspects of loneliness, human awkwardness and tragedy especially delicately and manages to bring across her idea without unnecessarily complicating and cluttering her writing. ...more These eight short stories by <---A>Jhumpa Lahiri</---A> are quiet, penetrating, and meticulously written.

The first five stories are distinct, while the last three are interrelated. Lahiri's prose seems so clean and precise that it is very easy to turn page after page despite the fact that her stories are not really plot-driven. Rather, each story delves into the psyche of each character with such skill that the reader can't help but feel extremely intimate with each one, whether male or female, likable or otherwise. Lahiri's characters are predominantly Bengalis that have moved from India to America. Some of her protagonists are the children of these Bengalis and themes may focus on the struggle to assimilate and the conflicts between the values of the parent and the desires of the children to pave their own way. These and other themes feel far-reaching, however, and the reader may recognize and understand many of the feelings, battles and tensions quite personally. Mother-daughter relationships as well as other parent-child connections, alcoholism, illness, raising children, love, marriage, separations, and death are all deftly scrutinized. Overwhelmingly, however, I recognized a sense of melancholy and loneliness in these characters as they sought to belong and to pursue their dreams. One of my favorite stories in the collection was the title story \"Unaccustomed Earth\", one about a young mother, <---C>Ruma</---C>, who renews her relationship with her father after her mother's death (not a spoiler). Ruma sets aside her career to move across the country to raise her young family. She craves a sense of happiness that seems always out of reach. A visit from her previously aloof father sheds a different light on this parent as the daughter watches him form a strong and loving bond with his grandson. \"Growing up, her mother's example \u2013 moving to a foreign place for the sake of marriage, caring exclusively for children and a household \u2013 had served as a warning, a path to avoid. Yet this was Ruma's life now.\" \"He wanted to shield her from the deterioration that inevitably took place in the course of a marriage, and from the conclusion he sometimes feared was true: that the entire enterprise of having a family, of putting children on this earth, as gratifying as it sometimes felt, was flawed from the start.\" The last three, interrelated stories are probably the most poignant of all. \"Hema and Kaushik\", also the names of the two protagonists, covers an expanse of time from when the two meet as children until their paths cross once again later in life on another continent. As children, Hema and Kaushik are forced together by circumstances and a friendship between parents which develops more out of a sense of a need to belong than to a true sense of affinity. Kaushik has a strong attachment to his mother and this will affect his choices and his feelings right into and through adulthood. A chance encounter brings Hema and Kaushik back together after many years. What draws one person to another? Is it destiny or some link to one's past that can't be severed? \"Their parents had liked one another only for the sake of their origins, for the sake of a time and place to which they'd lost access. Hema had never been drawn to a person for that reason, until now.\" I highly recommend this book if you enjoy short stories that have a wealth of depth despite their length, characters that are superbly drawn, and wonderful writing. Based on the first story and last set of stories, I would rate this book with 5 stars. However, as not all stories within the collection were right at the 5 star mark, although certainly worthy in their own right, I am giving this 4 stars. This is not my first Lahiri work and will most certainly not be my last! ...more I have often stated that I do not enjoy short stories, but although this is designated as such, it oversimplifies the content of this book.

She has the unique ability to simply, but fascinatingly communicate the features of the characters' behaviors, thoughts and emotions. In addition, she is able to express such dimensions so wellthat I felt I had become acquainted with these people. I was immediately captivated by her style and the tales that she wove. It was an emotional experience for me to read each story, from sheer delight, or humor, to grief and regret. Jhumpa Lahiri has written a beautiful book which I did not want to end. ...more \"It didn't matter where she was in the world, or whether or not she was dying; she had always given everything to make her homes beautiful, always drawn strength from her things, her walls.

But Kaushik never fully trusted the places he'd lived, never turned to them for refuge. From childhood, he realized now, he was always happiest to be outside, away from the private detritus of life.\" In each of the eight stories in this collection by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jhumpa Lahiri, the characters are displaced. Whether physically, moving from one country to another\u2014mostly looking at the Indian immigrant's experiences in America\u2014or figuratively, in a relationship torn asunder or strained by life's difficulties. And in each of them Lahiri expertly captures the emotions these characters go through, from jealousy and outrage to sorrow and desperation. In all of them she conveys so pointedly the irony of life: that even in painful moments, there's a sort of joy in knowing you at least feel something. It's this human experience, a sort of self-inflicted suffering, that Lahiri is encapsulate in words what so many authors try yet fail to do. The title story sees a daughter, now a mother and new resident of Seattle, welcoming her globetrotting father into her home. It explores the complexities of growing up and cleaving from your family to form your own. \"Only Goodness\" explores the responsibility of siblinghood, of past actions and their present consequences. And \"Nobody's Business\" takes on the commitment two people have for one another\u2014romantic or otherwise\u2014when choosing to share life together. The final three stories of the collection, in Part Two: Hema and Kaushik, look at the decades and unfolding events in the lives of two immigrant children. These were my personal favorite. Lahiri allows the reader into intimate moments, even unflattering ones, in a way that makes them so profoundly real. I am nearly convinced these characters have walked off the page into the world. Not since Adichie's Americanah have I felt so strongly. Needless to say, Lahiri has made her way onto my favorites shelf with this collection. If you read and loved Interpreter of Maladies , this is a must read. Not questions asked: 5 stars. ...more Eight short stories of remarkable depth, richness and resonance.

Lahiri's protagonists might all be Bengalis from India taking root in America and then often abroad, but their secrets, hopes and dreams are universal. The stories' endings are particularly powerful, full of surprises that never feel gimmicky. Stylistically, these are old-fashioned stories; you can see and feel Lahiri's debt to writers like William Trevor and Mavis Gallant in her clear, concise, insightful prose. There's little experimentation with form, and there's a certain sameness to settings and backgrounds (New England or New York City, ivy league colleages). She's equally good getting into the skin of men or women, young or old. Like priceless gems, though, these stories seem simple and lovely on the surface but are carefully cut, chosen and polished, hiding layers of mystery. ...more A real disappointment after her first two books.

Doing away with both the emotional gut-punches of displacement and desperation found in \"Interpreter of Maladies\" and the elegiac generational sweep of \"The Namesake,\" Lahiri in \"Unaccustomed Earth\" zeroes in on the least interesting dimension of her usual subjects: the interior monologues of fully assimilated, second-generation Indian-Americans who are ungratefully dissatisfied with their lives of privilege. Her formerly melancholic insight and pungent descriptions have given way to stale, distant whiffs of unpleasantness that lack gravity and empathy. Nothing but an elegantly written snooze. ...more Perhaps a new term needs to be used for short stories such as these. Each one is jam-packed with details that never bog down; each one is as dense and rich as a novel. The writing never falters; it is always smooth, flowing and self-assured. Of course the last 3 stories could be a novella, and we are lucky not to have to buy a separate book to experience them. Wonderful characters, wonderful stories, wonderful writing. Ever since I read Lahiri's first collection of stories, \"Interpreter of Maladies,\" when it was published some years ago, I've had a hard time figuring out just why I find her fiction so incredibly appealing and moving and memorable. Her writing style isn't particularly innovative, and she sticks to a fairly narrow set of themes: the impact of immigration on those who immigrate and their children, generally viewed through the experiences of Indians who move to the U.S., specifically New England. Ever since I read Lahiri's first collection of stories, \"Interpreter of Maladies,\" when it was published some years ago, I've had a hard time figuring out just why I find her fiction so incredibly appealing and moving and memorable. Her writing style isn't particularly innovative, and she sticks to a fairly narrow set of themes: the impact of immigration on those who immigrate and their children, generally viewed through the experiences of Indians who move to the U.S., specifically New England. I think it's that Lahiri manages to simultaneously convey very specific experiences, while underscoring the universality of those experiences. The way her characters struggle with marriage, child-rearing, immigration, and parent-child relationships are so fully formed and universal, but so carefully located in the experiences and specific backgrounds of her Indian and Indian-American characters. I don't think I'm doing a good job here of explaining just how well her fiction works. But, Unaccustomed Earth is a lovely book, one of the best I've read in ages, and I highly recommend it. ...more I have to admit that I was awaiting this book for many months and started reading it with a preconceived notion that the literary journey I was about to embark upon was one of immense finesse and depth. Some might argue that this mindset might cast a cloak on the negative qualities of the novel thereby making the stories more appealing. I've thought about this and beg to differ. Expectations of this height are hard to live by and many a (famous) novel have fallen short.

Some might argue that this mindset might cast a cloak on the negative qualities of the novel thereby making the stories more appealing. I've thought about this and beg to differ. Expectations of this height are hard to live by and many a (famous) novel have fallen short. Unaccustomed Earth did not. What attracts me to Jhumpa Lahiri's fiction is that I often find traces of myself and people I know in them. It's comforting to know that your trials and fears are not unique, that there can be meaning even in the mundane, mystery in the seemingly known. What started off with The Interpretor of Maladies, continued with The Namesake and found fruition in Unaccustomed Earth is a sensitive yet intense rendering of the intricate working of the heart and mind. perhaps the most poignant story of the 8-story collection, Only goodness is the story of a sister dealing with guilt and concern over her kid brother's alcoholism. Lahiri has a way of drawing the readers into the minds of her characters and making them a part of the thought process, both said and unsaid. It was almost as if Sudha's growing guilt and worry, embarrassment at her wedding, her longing for Rahul when he disappears, her sheer panic at finding her baby alone in the tub and her final resolve to prioritize her child and husband's needs over her brother's were all mine. What makes Lahiri's characters so memorable is their imperfection. They don't always do or say the right things. Many among us have fallen hard for the wrong man like Sang does in Nobody's Business. Many among us have felt an attraction outside wedlock like in Hell-Heaven. Many among us have even been caught between the sense of responsibility towards parents vs wanting to hold on to our independence and known way on life as Ruma does in the tittle story. Fate, death, passion, confusion, a search for isolation and rebellion have been as much a part of our lives as they have of Hema and Kaushik's in the trio of stories at the end. The prose is packed with emotional wisdom. The only not so positive quality that struck me is the sameness of the cultural backgrounds of the characters -- all highly educated Bengalis. Perhaps that is what Lahiri is intimately familiar with. The central theme is how these people deal with the crosscurrents of traditions and displacement of identity, how they strive to define their individuality and how they fight to cling on to the familiar. Assumptions are often negated and they are forced to deal with their new environs and new set of truths. Yes, one might argue that \"nothing happens\" but how often do life altering incidents happen in our lives anyway? Isn't life woven from single treads of everyday experiences, simple joys, of innocence, attachments and fears? ...more i think that, as short story collections go, this one is up there with the great masterpieces -- flannery o'connor, hawthorne, raymond carver, nadine gordimer, alice munro (the writers who come to mind are the ones who straightforwardly explore the torments of the human heart). the most extraordinary feeling i have about it is that i glided from story to story without having much of a sense of interruption. the stories flow into each other, having to do with people who are different (in age, gen i think that, as short story collections go, this one is up there with the great masterpieces -- flannery o'connor, hawthorne, raymond carver, nadine gordimer, alice munro (the writers who come to mind are the ones who straightforwardly explore the torments of the human heart). the most extraordinary feeling i have about it is that i glided from story to story without having much of a sense of interruption. the stories flow into each other, having to do with people who are different (in age, gender, lifestyle) but also similar in some deep way, so that you have a sense that you are reading about the same group of folks, people who share a profound connection. the last three stories are interconnected, yet i felt no difference. they all felt interconnected to me. part of it is that all these characters are locked inside, deeply alone. they are remote from others and also from themselves. i feel it would be extremely hard to have a relationship with them, and i wouldn't want to. yet, they seem so incredibly human, so easy to identify with. this is lahiri's sleight of hand, to make you feel both very close and infinitely distant from these people. these characters are also intensely self-contained, though not in an assured, relaxed way. they feel to me as if they were tightly wound up, and held themselves together with great care, aware that a sudden movement can make the tightly wound edifice of their lives spring into chaos. there is of course the theme of immigration, of living in a place that is not yours, and you don't feel as yours. this is always true in the book for the first-generation immigrants, the parents. most of the kids were born here -- hence the tragic, portentous intergenerational strife. all of the children seem married to people with anglo names, some of them clearly identified as white. it's strange how race doesn't seem to be much of a concern for lahiri. apart from one egyptian character, everyone is either bengali or assumed to be a white american. race-based discrimination never comes up. if anything, class is more of a concern. everyone is highly educated and well-off. so, oddly for a book that is so much about cultural and ethnic displacement, this reads to me more like an investigation of a particularly isolated section of the middle/upper middle class than as an investigation of race. in this sense, it is similar to... oh, who writes about the dislocation of the upper middle class in america? i feel i should be able to rattle off authors, yet can think only of movies: the ice storm , ordinary people , six degrees of separation (i guess they need to have donald sutherland in them!). writers love to probe the dissatisfactions and, ultimately, hidden horrors of the orderly middle/upper-middle class life (see michael haneke's funny games , which is supposed to be about voyeurism instead seems to me to be about class). this is what lahiri does here. is she suggesting that behind wealthy living lies some sort of cultural displacement, that being an immigrant is just one way to be out of place and out of touch? *** some more stray comments. this is not a cheerful book. it is, in fact, deeply sad. in one way or another, everyone is unhappy, and unhappiness is offered to you matter-of-fact, the way life is. there is no search for happiness, no pursuit of the american dream. at most, these characters seek tranquility and a quiet contentment. right now, actually, i can think only of the father of the first story... another father later on... like their parents and their arranged marriages, the second-generation children land in their lives rather than choosing them. there is a story in which a young man \"chooses\" his life and it is a quiet train wreck. even their jobs and their ph.ds seem to have been handed to them, rather than resulting from passion or aspiration or desire. this is not to say that they are not satisfied with their lives. rather, it's as if happiness, this all-american pursuit, were irrelevant, a foreign concept that doesn't apply. this book relentless focus is relationships, but they are portrayed as if each member lived in profound insularity. the story's protagonists, whose point of view we adopt, see others as if from inside a fish tank. a lot of time is spent being away from others rather than being with them. love, this other american obsession, is unstated and taken for granted, even when it's not there. same with the loss of love, and, ultimately, even death. one might be tempted to say that lahiri critiques our american obsession with the pursuit of intimacy -- gently mocks this country that, perhaps more than any other, has so much trouble with intimacy that it needs to keep circling around it, fantasizing about it, obsessing about it. but i don't think lahiri is after critiquing anything. i think she describes life as she sees it, the quiet grinding of it, with a sort of melancholy acceptance that appeals to me tremendously. one last word about language. this book could not be written in a simpler, plainer language. yet the language is gorgeous and the structure of the stories deep and dreamy and enchanting. the language matches the themes: there is no striving, no pulling, so thrashing. instead, lives are built with simplicity and respect, as if they were handed to the author the same way as they are handed to the characters, already formed, like an arranged marriage. ...more This won't be a usual review but more of a personal reflection.

Then I thought about the two books of Lahiri that I have - both short story collections - and why I had rated them 5 stars each. This is what happens when you feel in sync with such GR friends that they can make you question your own assessment and analysis... and this is the reason I love GR and spend way too much time on it. I have often held a copy of 'The Namesake' in my hands at bookstores when it was on sale or available cheaply as a secondhand book, yet I never felt compelled to buy it. Especially after I sifted through it and read a few passages at random. It felt no different than her short stories in terms of style and voice, that I then thought why would I read a book of almost 300 pages when I can read a short story of 25 pages with an even better impact. And this got me thinking as to why I've been wanting to change my rating for Unaccustomed Earth for a while now. You see, I needed to justify my reasoning changing it from 5 stars to 4 and from 4 to 3, and here's why. Lahiri comes across as a master of the short story craft... focus on the last word: craft. This, to me, is both her blessing and her curse. There is no doubt her style is that of someone who has completed an MFA in the USA (funny, that rhymes!) and is most likely why the technical aspects of her short stories are more or less flawless. But that's the technical aspect, which most MFA graduates from good programs in the USA seem to accomplish equally well, but what about the creative aspect? Sure the 'Interpreter of Maladies' was 'new', at least for my generation at the time it was published, and it was a fantastic compilation of well-crafted stories and the immigrant's tale who's trying to fit in in a new host country. It was a theme done often but represented in a fresh new package. 'Unaccustomed Earth' unfortunately just repeats more of the same, with one difference, the stories are longer. And that is not a good thing. Repetition all round, from one collection to another and, within each collection. The same themes, the same style, the same voices. Nothing new, nothing creative, no experimentation, no out-of-the-box thinking. It is for this reason that I have downgraded this book from 5 to 3 stars. The stories themselves - I repeat - are really well executed, but that's all the praise they'll get from me. I still keep my 5 star rating for 'Interpreter of Maladies' because (despite the repetition in it), it was fresh and it was her first collection (which is quite impressive) and the stories there were 'tight' - the right length with all aspects of each story well-rounded and finely written. However, playing it safe isn't for me and one book of the same is enough, two is overkill. ...more It's been some time since I read Unaccustomed Earth. I read it as an impressionable teenager and many of the nuanced impressions that were stamped upon my mind by this book have been more or less washed away by the heavy downpour of classics that has kissed my bookshelf since.

I read it as an impressionable teenager and many of the nuanced impressions that were stamped upon my mind by this book have been more or less washed away by the heavy downpour of classics that has kissed my bookshelf since. All I can glean out of the dusty recesses of my memory about this excellent collection of Indo-nostalgic short stories is feeling an ephemeral sense of loss. I remember it leaving me in the throes of a synthesized loneliness, the kind which does not spring from the aftermath of a personal tragedy, but from a reconciliation with the transience and melancholy of life. I recall that it felt agreeable to be sad and lonely then, sitting with my elbow on the window sill, watching the grey clouds darken the horizon, listening to the drip-drip of the rain. I hope to read this book again. I'm sure it'll make me feel all right, just the way I like it. P.S: To those who haven't read it yet, Unaccustomed Earth and the monsoon go hand in hand. So try getting a copy before the chill sets in. ...more \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u06cc\u0627\u062f \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u06cc

The mother is in her domestic, All American backyard, and she has dressed herself ornately in a tightly pinned sari, then doused herself in gasoline. She is staring at the sunset, wondering if she will light herself. Lahiri folds an iteration of the transnational subaltern into the neoliberal American immigrant, questioning the boundaries of each position and depicting an all together fraught subjectivity. I am looking forward to reading more of her work. ...more Lahiri is a treasure. I picked up this collection of short stories because I loved her previous book, The Namesake. These stories all involve Indian families who have moved to the United States and are struggling to adjust. Often there's tension with their children, who only want to fit in with Americans. I couldn't pick a favorite story in this collection -- they all meant something special to me. I hope you find something in them, too. I just never really get into her books...they seem heavy, tedious and plodding to me. After a few hundred pages, I returned this new one to the library. I guess I am just not a fan of this writer. I know she is very popular and you would think I would relate to the culture, but...I'm just not into it. I thought the short stories were predictable and trite to tell the truth. I don't know why I never wrote a review on this before. It's terrific!!! I was comparing books with a new friend - whom I just connected with- and came to this book - It deserved the Pulitzer in my opinion!!!

When I struck the phrase out, which I did with such rage in my pencil that it ripped the paper, the student complained that this was what teachers had always taught him: \"Art is simple, art is sincere.\" Someday I must trace this vulgar absurdity to its source. A schoolmarm in Ohio? A progressive ass in New York? Because, of course, art at its greatest is fantastically deceitful and complex. -Vladimir Nabokov, in an interview with Playboy Current English-language writing, especially American writing, seems to strive towards telling \"universal\" stories that, while they may have \"ethnic coloring\" if one's name is something like Jhumpa Lahiri, are in the end about families and relationships \"that we can all relate to\" because the characters are \"like your family and mine.\" Can we say that this is not particularly interesting stuff? Might we add that in most cases these types of stories are bland and not a little trite? Lahiri's upper middle-class children of Indian immigrants attend Ivy League schools, have marital problems, fret about babysitters, and get dismayed by culture clashes with their traditional parents. These are pretty narrow worlds - almost invariably there's an Indian man married to a white woman or a white man married to an Indian woman; doctors, lawyers, professors, and prep schools abound. Nearly everyone has, or is in the process of getting, a PhD. It would be a tremendous undertaking, counting the times these three letters appear together in this book. Though many good folk might be inclined to praise Lahiri for the \"respect\" she shows her characters, her lack of irony and condescension, here we find the root of the problem. Lahiri's brittle little world of shopping, house hunting, lavish marriage ceremonies; the mention of something called a \"mommy group\" that sent shivers of horror down my spine; the trips to Calcutta, London, and Rome of which no one frets about the costs; the characters whose capacity for self-reflection is ultimately as shallow as their spiritual crises - this is not the material of great fiction. A better writer would take these people with a pinch of salt, because they are slightly ridiculous, and would find a way to give the depth to their stories that is missing from their lives. Lahiri's stories, unfortunately, simply reinforce a series of platitudes about marriage and death and grief. Lahiri doesn't question that the United States is where people go to \"make it,\" and the majority of immigrants who haven't made it or are just barely making it are completely absent from the landscape of Unaccostomed Earth . Although desperation and despair make appearances throughout, they are generally prompted by marriage strain, the death of a mother, a brother's drinking problem, unrequited love, or cultural displacement. Never is it suggested that the dreary accumulation of degrees and big salaries and household furnishings, or the steady intake of television and fast food, or that the vacuity of American life might take some blame. Lahiri's characters are incredibly materialistic and often more than a touch smug - and this may point to why she's so popular with book reviewers, who tend to exist in the same sorts of bubbles. In one story in particulary, about a PhD student (naturally!) smitten with his Indian housemate and distraught over her attachment to her creep BMW-driving Egyptian boyfriend, the who cares? factor is overwhelming. The student doesn't have much of a personality, and both the Indian girl and her Egyptian boyfriend are vile. The collection is not always so grim, and there's even one that is quite good - \"Heaven-Hell,\" a portrait of a woman stuck in a suffocating traditional marriage, with a chilling finale - but generally we find the same worn scenarios, the same tiresome, self-obsessed people. There is something obscene about the naming of brands in fiction, and something suspect about the incredible rate at which they seem to crop up in current American writing. These products, foisted on people in every hour of their waking lives, are even given fawning descriptions in fiction now. If in the book someone has a breakfast cereal, one wonders why the name of that particular cereal is always deemed necessary for inclusion. To give but an iceberg tip from Lahiri's book: Cheerios, Frosted Flakes, MapQuest, Ovaltine, Fisher Price, Dunkin' Donuts, Tonka trucks, Lincoln Logs, Avon, Sears, Johnny Walker, Jordan Marsh, Good Housekeeping , U.S. News and World Report . All of which are, naturally, spoken of approvingly. If one were uncharitable one might suspect that Lahiri was even getting paid for all these sprinklings of good words about delicious donuts and smooth, enjoyable whiskeys. Jhumpa Lahiri's prose is simple and sincere, sincerely simple, simply sincere. In the U.K. paperback edition I read there are nearly fifty (!) positive blurbs from the U.S., the U.K., Ireland, and India. Comparisons are made to Hemingway and Chekhov by someone who has never read either or is hopping insane. A reviewer for the New Statesman says \"Lahiri's work is the literary opposite of the fashionably sprawling and noisy fiction\" that is common to the school of \"what is called 'the immigrant experience.'\" While it's easy to agree that said sprawling and noisy fiction is indeed excruciating, and while we all surely wait with bated breath for the day when such drivel will make its way to the same cultural junkyard that will be the well-deserved end for almost all of late 20th and early 21st century \"culture,\" Jhumpa Lahiri does not, sad to say, represent a meaningful alternative. Another reviewer unintentionally hits the mark when she states Lahiri's writing is \"unadorned,\" \"deliberate\" and \"unshowy\" - what she really means is that it's indistinct and not really above the grade of writing one commonly finds in so-called popular fiction. Indeed, the descriptions are often cliche - women, though in their thirties, often look youthful as high school girls, and Lahiri's male narrators sound exactly like Lahiri's female narrators (indeed the reader wonders about the sort of fellow who would describe his father as grey at the temples yet still looking \"vigorous\"). The writing isn't really much better than the kind of \"unadorned\" writing one gets in a John Grisham or Stephen King novel, though Unaccustomed Earth is what is considered literature these days, because it's about \"serious\" subjects, and not about lawyers tangled in webs of conspiracy or small New England towns in which unspeakable evils lurk. If Jhumpa Lahiri is one of the best America has, as these ecstatic reviewers crowding the cover and first several pages of my paperback proclaim, then these are dark days for American literature indeed. To that end I recommend readers pick a book by Ernest Hemingway or Anton Chekhov, and avoid Jhumpa Lahiri, unless you like knowing what dazzling university your fictional characters have graduated from and what they prefer in the way of breakfast cereals. ...more Having just finished Unaccustomed Earth, I have to say I thought it was fantastic how Lahiri manages to catch the edge of human interactions--all that we don't say to each other throughout our lives. I really was close to tears at the end of the final story. This is my first experience with her writing other than reading one story. That previous story gave me a glimpse of her skill but now I have the full blown view of a writer who appears to be at a peak of ability.

To me, she is one of the only authors who comes even close to articulating my experience as a child born and raised in the U.S. by immigrant parents, constantly straddling two worlds. I really enjoyed this book -- not nearly as much as I adored \"The Namesake\" (one of my all-time favorite books!), but more than her collection of short stories, \"The Interpreter of Maladies.\" This book is a collection of short stories. The first half is comprised of five short stories, the second half consists of three additional stories focusing on two characters. For those of you with old issues of the New Yorker around, three of these stories were published awhile back in that magazine. As with Lahiri's earlier pieces, my favorite aspect of her storytelling is her eye for detail. Her descriptions of everything ranging from a boy's coat a young girl is forced to wear by her frugal parents, to buttery and slightly coconutty tea biscuits evokes strong images in my mind, images that help create vivid characters in your mind. I found that these stories left me feeling a sad, yet subtle sense of loss. I particularly related to the loss described in a few of the stories in terms of the lead characters' relationship with their parents. Perhaps it's because they were in situations I could relate to, but have difficulty articulating --- that intense feeling of love and connectedness to your parents, yet a dual sense of space and silence that fills that relationship between parent and child in adulthood. Ultimately, I found this book to be a collection of beautifully written, melancholy stories. Nothing monumental happens to the characters in this book, but the stories still left me contemplating the complexities of relationships --- between partners, child and parent, brother and sister. Worth the read, in my opinion. ...more It's been so long since I have read Jhumpa Lahiri and I've had this book since it was published in 2008. And just as I remember, her writing is exquisite, particularly when she writes short stories. I think it takes a very special writer to be able to write short stories well; they have a very limited amount of pages in which to get their readers 'hooked' into the story. Mission accomplished here! I am going to do synopsis reviews of some of the stories as I read them. #1 - Unaccustomed Earth - Th It's been so long since I have read Jhumpa Lahiri and I've had this book since it was published in 2008. And just as I remember, her writing is exquisite, particularly when she writes short stories. I think it takes a very special writer to be able to write short stories well; they have a very limited amount of pages in which to get their readers 'hooked' into the story. Mission accomplished here! I am going to do synopsis reviews of some of the stories as I read them. #1 - Unaccustomed Earth - This story was an emotional one for me. It is the story of Ruma, a young woman who has moved to Seattle from the East Coast for her successful husband's career. Ruma's own career as an attorney is put on hold as they begin a family. They have one young son, Akash, and another child on the way. The story is very touching as Ruma's father (he is widowed) comes to spend a week with her and Akash (Ruma's husband is out of town on business). There are many emotions as Ruma remembers back to when her mother was alive and her father remembers back to when Ruma was a child; and how children once grown and some of their widowed parents go on to have lives of their own. A mature and bond is solidified between Ruma and her father and a very loving one between Ruma's father and his grandson, Akash. #5 Nobody's Business - A very troubling story of a wronged young woman, Sang. When a friend trys to help her see things as they are, the friendship is severed as Sang refuses to believe the possibilities. What was very fun for me, however, is the story was set in Boston, some parts in the Back Bay and the South End, both of which are near and dear to my heart. And there is scene that was set in Dunkin' Donuts as well! Otherwise, not an uplifting story, but beautifully written as always by the author. Undoubtedly my favorite stories in this collection are the final 3 which are inter-related stories. It is Part Two of the book entitled \" Hema and Kaushik \". The first of the stories \" Once in a Lifetime \" we meet Hema (the girl) and Kaushik (the boy) when they are young children, as their parents are friends. Again this story was really fun for me as it too is set in the Boston area and in fact, mentions my home town of Malden and talks about people taking the T from Malden or Medford to attend a party at Hema's parents' house in Harvard/MIT area. This story is told in the remembering voice of Hema and set in 1974 when she is 6 and Kaushik is 9. Fast forward to the second story \" Year's End \" which is told in the remembering voice of Kaushik who is now in college. This story is all about Kaushik and how he comes to terms with changing familial circumstances as he enters his adult life. Kaushik has a very special bond with his mother which is pivotal to all 3 stories. The third and final story, \" Going Ashore \", is told in a narrative voice of neither Kaushik nor Hema. Yet the two meet for the first time since they were teenagers, both now in their 30's and in Rome for different professional reasons. While I enjoyed the entire book, these stories of Kaushik and Hema left me not even being able to pick up another book right away, I was so drawn to their story. The writing is exquisite, personal, moving, wrenching, beautiful.....for me these 3 stories surpassed anything previous that I have read by the author and I have now read all of her books. I'm so glad I own this book so that I can revisit it over and over again. Oh and once you read the book, you will know exactly which story the cover picture belongs to. It's not what you think :) ...more Another wonderful book by Lahiri. This is a book of short stories where each story tells about a Bengali family and how they are assimilating to the American way of life. Which is pretty typical of a Lahiri book. But, writers are always told to write what you know. I'm always amazed at how much detail and emotion that she can get into a short story. Getting the details of family life for one Bengali family for their entire lives. I think she does best with her short story collections. This is he Another wonderful book by Lahiri.

Getting the details of family life for one Bengali family for their entire lives. I think she does best with her short story collections. This is her second book of short stories, with the first one, Interpreter of Maladies, winning the Pulitzer prize. It's hard for me to choose between these two books. I would love to see her write more short stories. But then again, I would read anything that Lahiri writes. ...more I kind of liked this. The writing is good but the pace of the stories is v e r y s l o w . . . it seems to take ages to get to the ending. This would be OK except that the endings are really not that astounding; you're left with less of an \"Oh, my God\" feeling than a \"well, duh; what did she expect?\" one. The bodies of the stories would have been more in proportion to the ends if the writer had not worked so hard to draw them out. They end up feeling overwritten, and all for nothing.

The bodies of the stories would have been more in proportion to the ends if the writer had not worked so hard to draw them out. They end up feeling overwritten, and all for nothing. One also gets the impression that this is more an exercise of personal therapy than writing intended for an audience. The stories are all pretty similar in theme--distant, old-country parents disappointed by their first-generation Americanized children; and Americanized children trapped between two cultures--with variations that are, ultimately, trivial. All right, already; get some counseling and move on. Finally, as a personal irritation, the protagonists of the stories are all weak, indecisive, uninteresting people who cannot stand up either to their Indian elders or the European-Americans in their lives, even European-Americans who are not out to victimize them. If you are so bland and spineless and have no identity apart from that which your unappreciative parents force on you, small wonder you're not happy in your life, no matter what your cultural background. There seems to be no middle ground between being your parents' overachieving dream child and being a grand failure (in this case, one character is an alcoholic and one is used and crushed by a worthless boyfriend). No, I'm not Indian, but I don't think the issues at hand are really Indian-specific. Lots of children of overambitious parents have problems. My mother went through much the same thing as the only one in her blue-collar family to get an advanced degree and leave the geographical area where her entire family had lived for 300 years. My problem with this set of stories is that the protagonists all seem so powerless and hollow.

Jhumpa Lahiri creates timeless families that straddle the cultural divide between America and India. She captures the conflict of growing up as one tries to balance one's parent's wishes with the influence of one's heritage and the culture of one's surroundings. Of the first part of the book, I loved \"Unaccustomed Earth\", \"Hell-Heaven\", and \"Only Goodness.\" The other two stories were great, but those three are my favourite--particularly \"Only Goodness,\" which resonates with me as an older sibling who is now watching his younger brother grow up (luckily not as an alcoholic--yet....). And that's the great thing about Lahiri's writing. There seems to be a number of authors, such as Yann Martel ( Life of Pi ) and Rohinton Mistry ( A Fine Balance ) who can write stories involving Indian culture that speak to much more universal truths. This is not through any intrinsic value of Indian culture that makes it superior, but I think I'm falling in love with that setting. The themes these authors profess affect everyone, however, and that's why Lahiri's stories are so moving. Part two consists of three stories involving a woman, Hema, and a man, Kaushik, both Bengalis. The first part is told from the viewpoint of Hema as a young girl, who becomes fascinated with Kaushik when his family stays with hers while moving back to America from India. In the second, Kaushik recounts his difficulty adjusting his father's remarriage several years after his mother's death from cancer. In the third story, Hema and Kaushik reunite for the first time in several decades, in Rome, where they rediscover each other. The ending is somewhat tragic, but at the same time it possesses a sense of stillness. These stories made me want to stop and appreciate each moment in life. I found this book in the library, but now I'm buying a copy. I want it on my shelf. ...more After weeks of waiting anxiously, of reading about how good the book is, I finally got my hands on Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s Unaccustomed Earth . The beauty of Lahiri\u2019s writing is in the ordinariness of it. She has an elegant style but does nothing to draw undue attention to the writing itself; she employs no tricks that distract from her narrative.

In the story, a widowed father visits his married daughter in Seattle. Ruma debates over inviting her father to move in with her and her family. It is a simple scenario, but I\u2019ve found myself considering the situation for days. What would I do if my mother died? Would I ask my father to move in with me? Could he be happy living with me? Could I be happy living with him? Although the main characters are all Bengali, these are not stories about or for a specific audience. I can see myself, place myself into these narratives: the struggle with a loved one\u2019s substance abuse, the pain of unrequited love. As with any collection of short stories, I was drawn to some more than others. The book is split into two sections. The first contains four stories; the second three connected stories. I have mixed feelings about the second section: Hema and Kaushik. These stories veer a bit from Lahiri\u2019s formula. The first two are written in first person, and the third does not rely on ordinary, everyday events. Instead, it turns on a major world event, losing its sense of universality. I spent several days reading this collection; I could not simply speed through it as I thought I would. The stories have a weightiness of real life that I found was best taken in small doses. ...more There are totally eight short stories, divided into five in part one and 3 in part two. Each one is decently paced and slowly warms up our senses to the emotions. Every time I completed a story, I wondered if that was the best story of the collection. They get better and better, and the second part with all the three stories interconnected, and yet stand separated was the best. I loved Ms. Lahiri\u2019s Lowland, and her style gets better with short stories.
