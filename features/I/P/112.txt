I just ordered mine :) ***********updated FULL review*********** I wasn't sure how it could be possible, but <+++>The Evolution of Mara Dyer</+++> was even more intese and twisted than The Unbecoming. Before reading: Huh,<---M> my book is signed with</---M>, \"Who will you believe?\" Interesting. Well I guess I'll go with <---A>Michelle Hodkin</---A>. After reading: NO ONE. I BELIEVE NO ONE. EXCEPT NOAH SHAW. I WILL BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE SAYS. The Evolution goes into Mara's family history as well as Noah's. I would think that I would be able to make some theories from that, but nope. Fret not people, even though new information was tossed in, there were a lot of questions answered from The Unbecoming. I never looked at anything the same through out this book. One moment I would feel like I was finally putting the story together, but then I would turn the page and all of my theories would get burned. There were so many \"what just happened moments\". At first I would try to make some sense out of it, but after a while I just rolled with it. Kind of. I started categorizing my reactions to those moments into the \"my life after finishing\" list, and this was what I got. My Life After Finishing <+++>The Evolution of Mara Dyer</+++>: Day 1: Maybe I'll just leave my lamp on tonight. Day 2: I'll just turn ALL the lights on in my house. Day 3: Maybe I should just not clear the fog from my mirror after taking a shower. Day 4: SUPER PARANOID. NOBODY TOUCH ME. Day 5: Has brother stand next to me while I brush my teeth. One of the many things I loved about this book was Mara Dyer and Noah Shaw. They just work. It is how it is. They will forever be one of my favorite couples. I loved every moment of The Evolution of Mara Dyer. Even though Mara Dyer is the reason I can't look into the mirror after I take a shower, I will read anything by Michelle Hodkin. ...more \u201cTell me what you see.

In The Evolution of Mara Dyer Mara's family is seriously concerned about her mental state and decides that severe treatment is the only way to get their daughter back. The thing is, Mara is not crazy but pretends to acknowledge that she is crazy in order to stay out of mental institutions, but she's afraid that she will lose her sanity if she doesn't get answers. Answers about her powers, the ghost from her past that seems to h(a)unt, her grandmother, some identical pendants and a creepy doll.

It was creepy , so creepy that I couldn't sleep without the lights on, that the concept of the monsters that lurk in the dark seemed somehow real. Michelle Hodkin found her way into my brain and into my heart, and I am scared of what she'll do with that power. And that ending left me in the verge of hysteria. \u201cThis was the boy I loved.

In fact, after hearing this, Jamie gives that speech about how he's not sorry she died, and then gets sent home early because he was throwing up in the bathroom. He realizes that he may have been responsible for her death Example 3: When Jude is torturing him, Jamie tells him to let go - and Jude lets go.

Up to now, my heartbeat hasn\u2019t returned to normal. It hasn\u2019t since I started reading the book, I mean devouring it (took me only two afternoons to finish it). In the first book, Mara Dyer is the hero/anti-hero who blames herself for the death of her best friend. She starts seeing, hearing and feeling weird things which her family and doctors dismiss as simply symptoms of PTSD. In the second book, her symptoms seem to aggravate and require extreme psychological/medical intervention. But the huge question is, is she really just seeing things or could they be products of a paranormal phenomenon or is it entirely something else? Tag along with Noah (my love) and Mara as they uncover these mysteries about themselves and more. Still told in the extremely unreliable voice of Mara, the story is an equally riveting read as its predecessor laced with mystery, humor, sarcasm, romance and most of all, absolute creepiness (which explains why my heart won\u2019t stay in its rightful place the entire time I was reading.) I won\u2019t say more because I'm going to dive into the third book because I need to know what happens and I really have to prove my existing theories true.

Yeah, this book has those things. If you were left scrambled after The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer, I have good news for you. You get some answers. (And OH MY GOD, Noah. He loves her so, so much. It's insane.) But then there's an ass ton of new information that will leave you sitting there with a pen and paper, eyes darting to and fro, trying to divy up your attentions between devouring this book and fiercely mapping out flow charts to try and make sense of what mastermind Michelle Hodkin is illustrating before your eyes. I did get a little nervous at one point that it was taking a spin towards WTF-territory. But then I learned to bask in the WTFery. I trust where this is going. I always trust the unreliable narrators. It'll all come together, through hell or high water. I'm sleep-deprived but shameless in my love and devotion to this series and this author. If the world ends before I read The Retribution of Mara Dyer, I will be seriously pissed. Dead, but pissed. I will have no remorse for the amount of poltergeisting I will do. Preorder. Like now. I will be buying two. (I need one where I can highlight and circle and star and draw gnarly sketches of Noah and Mara kissing, cuddling, getting married in the margins around all my favorite lines.

In fact, I may (or may not have) done a happy dance when I finally had the book in my hands. And this happy dance may or may not have been incredibly embarrassing and performed in public... Me while reading: This book was an addiction. It's fast-paced and full of creepiness, revelations, and sexy times with Noah, and if you think you can just stop after one chapter, you are lying to yourself. The stakes, suspense, and mystery are all elevated in Evolution. More than ever, you see Mara's sanity being put in question, to the point where she doesn't even know whether or not she's experiencing reality or a delusion. Reading this story was akin to playing a mind game Half the time I was trying to figure out who to believe, what the truth really was, and the other half, I was questioning everything I thought. Unlike many YA books, Evolution really included Mara's family into what was going on. Her parents aren't absentees or idle spectators. They see their daughter in trouble and they act. And don't even get me started on the sibling relationship in the Dyer family because I won't be able to stop gushing! Mara's relationship with her brothers, Daniel especially, was just incredibly realistic and SO sweet. It definitely made me wish I had an older brother like Daniel. My favorite part of this book, though, was seeing more of Mara and Noah's relationship. At the beginning of the series, it seemed like the only thing really tying the two of them together was their inexplicable abilities. In this book, however, it becomes so much more apparent that these two are perfect for each other! I think it's safe to say that they are both quite screwed up as a result of their respective powers, but when they're together, they make each other better (which sounds cheesy, I know, but there's really no way to describe it!) They keep each other grounded when everything around them is questionable. I especially enjoyed seeing more of Noah's character. He wasn't exactly a flat character in Unbecoming, but I definitely didn't get to know him as much as I wanted to. Evolution did a great job of showing me more of Noah Elliot Simon Shaw and I loved it. Eep. Help. I'm swooning. Me after reading: In Unbecoming, I was full of questions, wondering just what the heck Mara was and how it was possible that she could do the things she did. In Evolution, it feels like Michelle Hodkin is finally letting you in on the big secret.... but it's all a big. Fat. Lie!!! It's like she's dangling this delicious-looking carrot of truth in front of you, making you read page after page after page, but in the end, all you are left with is a blown mind and more questions. Oh, and frustration. Heaps of that. Well played Ms. Hodkin, well played. Rating: 5 stars Dear Ms. Hodkin, Book three.... Pretty please? ...more I think my brain melted.

I did love it, but I had several \"WHAT EVEN THE HECK\" moments that confused me too much. Also this book is too huge. Way too huge. It dribbles on so much in the middle it was actually irritating??? Which is a shame because book 1 was perfection. I have yet to meet a YA book that's over 500 words which I feel needed I think my brain melted.

Which is a shame because book 1 was perfection. I have yet to meet a YA book that's over 500 words which I feel needed all those words. BUT ANYWAY. A quick list of my complaints and then onto my fangirling. \u2022 Mara's parents let Noah stay over...a lot. And they, believe shenanigans won't go down?? BAH AHAHA. What idiot parents. -_- \u2022 Also while I ship Noah and Mara like nothing else (because they are cute and needful)...their romance almost felt too old? Like I felt they were in their 20s, not 17 at times? It's not graphically or sexual or anything, don't get me wrong -- but it doesn't feel like a TEEN romance. \u2022 Jamie's potential is STILL wasted, dangit. \u2022 There is a huge \"AFJDKSLAFDJ WUT WUT NO NO\" moment at the end, but because the book is like 95% \"is this real or not real\"...I didn't get thumped by the plot twist. I don't know if it's real? So I'm not even concerned. So either a) the book is to blame, or b) I'm a cold-hearted monster. Hmm. Let's go with a)? \u2022 It was too freaking long. TOO FREAKING LONG, I SAY. ....Okay, but you know what?! I still absolutely totally astronomically loved it. There's something about the writing??! It's so dreamy and dark and nightmarish. And the writing weaves in the supernatural with the contemporary SO PERFECTLY. Plus I'm a big fan of unreliable narrators. If you think Mara was unhinged in book 1....hahahaha, oh darling. SHE GETS WORSE. She loses memory. Loses time. Sleep walks. Is noted giving deranged laughs after bad stuff goes down. And she's falling apart and she knows it. It was like a spiral downwards and I couldn't look away. Also it was SO SO SAD because she's experiencing all this evil stuff and no one believes her and is diagnosing her a schizophrenic. ...which, come to think on it, makes me wonder about my stance on this. Like is this what it's LIKE to develop schizophrenia? Is the book saying schizophrenics are really just seeing another world and aren't crazy? I'm...I'm unsure how to feel about the niggly details, tbh. It didn't spoil the story for me, personally, but I wonder if the book would be offensive to someone actually suffering with schizophrenia or knowing someone who is? Things to ponder... OKAY and even though the ending plot twist didn't stab me... I STILL AM FREAKING UNPLEASED OKAY?!??!?! Take it back. Take it back right now and make things okay. Omgggggg. I need book 3 immediately and my library doesn't have it so I'm going to have to sit here in PAIN. INDEFINITE PAIN. There were plenty of hospitals, asylums, creepy dolls, and witty banter (thank goodness for the banter). I confess to being partially in love with the insufferably smart and gorgeous Noah (!!) and just rooting for Mara to figure out the mystery behind all of this (!!) and I love the emphasis on family and how much horror-y (that is a word!) this book is. I LOVE IT AND I WANT MORE. ...more Pre-review: I'm at page. 255 and I want to list out a few things I wish Michelle Hodkin would write in the remaining part of The Evolution of Mara Dyer : (1) Mara is in fact crazy.

(6) Mara goes all psycho-bitch and kills her family members. If any of these things really take place, it would definitely make my day! NOTE: I did a buddy read with Alice when reading this book. Rating: it's a 'I can't give a flying fuck to a book which keeps refusing to make sense' negative stars. Since there's no such thing as negative stars in the GR rating system, I had to make do with one star. Supposedly I should feel sorry for Mara Dyer, because our Super Special Lovely Snowflake Heroine is being wrongly accused of being insane. But for the life in me, how can I feel sorry for her when she keeps acting like a psycho-bitch and talking down at almost every single mental patient in the story? As to Mara's love interest Noah...well he is in fact better in this second book, but I still hate his cocky guts and the way he seems to think he can buy everything and everyone with his big wallet. I know, Noah is from a super rich family and he clearly has money to burn, but still. Michelle Hodkin's writing is in fact slightly better than the first book as well; sadly the writing still isn't good enough to cover up for the massive, larger-than-life flaws which plagued the entire book, namely: (1.) The cheesy, going-nowhere romance between Noah and Mara: Although I'm glad that there's no love triangle in the book, but I still can't see what's so deep and meaningful about two teenagers going on about \"Oh you're so beautiful, I want to kiss you, but NO! I can't kiss you because it'll kill you! I want to sex you up behind your parents' back but NO! We can't do it! It's not right!\" Give me a break. (2.) The mind-numbing boredom: There's no revelation, no plot twists, no development, until the very end. (3.)The 'so-bad-it's-bad' attempts at create tension and suspense: I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie whenever Miss Hodkin tries to scare her readers with her 'spooky scenes'. (4.)Author being greedy and doesn't know where to stop: This time, we have Jude haunting Mara, we have Mara trying to pretend she's normal, we have the drama about the fortuneteller's foretelling Noah's death, we have this mysterious, never-explained Abel Lukumi character hopping in and out at random, we have Noah's family being somehow connected to Mara's grandmother and we also have Mara's late grandmother and the spooky events took place years ago back in India and Mara having random flashbacks about it? Last but not least, we also have (view spoiler) [ some evil doctors running shady experiments on Mara, Noah and the rest of the teenage patients in the program? (hide spoiler) ] That's just too fucking much. (5.)Mara's constantly making rude remarks on mental illness and mental patients : What can I say...whenever I started to think the writing is getting good, Mara the Main Character just has to start badmouthing mentally ill people AGAIN . Oh yes, she had already started it in book 1, but now in the book 2, she's at it again. For example, she calls a fellow teenage patient in the program 'a psycho' before addressing said patient as 'batshit crazy' in front of the whole group. Rude, isn't it? It sounds to me like Mara really thinks she's too innocent and special to suffer mental illness, she also whines nonstop about other people labeling her as crazy the whole time! But our heroine still thinks it's within her right to judge and label someone else as 'crazy' and 'psycho'. Double standards, how lovely. And then our lovely heroine also comes up with the following line: But with something else (schizophrenia)---this was it for me. A lifetime of psych ward and medication. No college. No life.(page. 33) NO LIFE? Okay, let's be frank here. No one wants to suffer schizophrenia, no one wants to be locked in a psych ward; but does it mean people who suffer schizophrenia 'have no life?' Mara, when will you stop making mental illness sounds like the most scary, disgusting thing on earth? That's fucking disrespectful, it's fucking discrimination ; if you asked me. By the end of the story, I can't believe (view spoiler) [after it's revealed that Jude's special power is to drain the life-force of other creatures around him whenever he is injured, in the final showdown between him and Mara, there already are two teenagers being drained by Jude, but for the whole time Mara DID NOTHING to save those two barely breathing teens; instead Mara just keeps beating Jude whilst the two teenagers are lying nearby, with their life force being sucked dry? WTF? (hide spoiler) ] I am done! I can deal with the MC being a psycho bitch, but I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE MC BEING A COLD HEARTENED BITCH WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT TWO OTHER TEENS DYING AT HER FEET!

She couldn\u2019t imagine that after everything she\u2019s been through, the boy she loves would still be keeping secrets. She\u2019s wrong. In this gripping sequel to The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer, the truth evolves and choices prove deadly. What will become of Mara Dyer next? Things pick up practically where we left of in The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer. It's a couple days after (view spoiler) [her father was shot and Jude made an appearance at the police station. (hide spoiler) ] Mara doesn't know what or who she can trust and how she can keep everyone safe from herself. I was falling apart and all my pieces were scattering to the wind. How my heart ached for Mara . What do you do when you can't trust those around you. When you can't even trust yourself. When people have told you you're crazy so many times that you, slowly, begin to believe it yourself. Mara is an incredibly unreliable narrator. One where I'm constantly questioning anything she says to me. Yet, I find myself wanting to believe her. Which just leads me to having more and more questions about everything and everyone. . . . no one could protect me from myself. Where do things stand with Noah? He's been there for Mara from the beginning. Trying to help her. Trying to protect her. She isn't the only one changing. Every day she shapes me into something else. Oh, how I wish I could take Noah into my arms and make everything okay. We learn more about him and his past in Evolution and it was heartbreaking. He's much more damaged than we were led to believe. I loved how supportive he was of Mara. How he always believed her. How he doted on her every whim, despite how crazy it seemed at the moment. He was dedicated to helping her, in being strong for her, and it broke my heart to see that he needed someone to be his rock sometimes. \u201cI must be made of nothing to feels so much nothing.\u201d Noah and Mara . . . *happy sigh* I ship it so hard. So hard . They are both damaged in their own ways but they make each other better. I don't think Mara or Noah would be able to survive without each other. \u201cI\u2019m too selfish to leave you,\u201d I said. Noah pulled back so I could see his smile. \u201cI\u2019m too selfish to let you.\u201d *is now a pile of mushy feelings on the floor* \u201cIf I were to live a thousand years, I would belong to you for all of them. If we were to live a thousand years, I would want you mine in each one.\u201d Mara and her family . . . that's a tough relationship to put into words. It's hard to put on a fake smile and pretend everything is okay when those closest to you don't believe you. But how could she (and I) expect them to? You could see how much they were trying to help her, how they only wanted what was best, but wouldn't listen to her. And when they did, it only reinforced their idea that she was mentally ill. Which is completely understandable but still a hard pill to swallow (no pun intended). Everybody else . . . is pretty much crazy. With a few exceptions, like Jamie, who still manages to make me laugh my ass off. Other than that, crazy. The sheer insanity . . . it's just too much to put into words. Noah acted like he felt nothing because he felt everything. He seemed not to care because he cared too much. Creep factor = very high. You've been warned. Some scenes literally had my heart pounding . And it was achieved by the simplest things. There were a few instances where I felt like things were a little too dramatic in order to get a reaction out of the reader. I didn't think all the writing in blood and dead animals were necessary. They were a little over-the-top for me. Other than that, I was thoroughly creeped out. My hair was plastered to my face, and I was pale. But I looked okay. Maybe a little thin. A little tired. But normal. Then my reflection winked. Even though I didn't. I don't know how Mara manages . . . I would've been a vegetable by then. The writing was flawless. Michelle Hodkin creates a story with the perfect amount of humor, angst, mystery, and horror. The writing leaves you entranced and on the edge of your seat. The witty dialogue and dry humor between the characters keeps things from getting too intense. She creates such suspense. Each chapter ending is like a little cliffhanger of it's own. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a little crazy. The only difference between us and them is that they hide it better.\u201d This isn't my first rodeo. I read the ending of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer. I had to wait two years for the rest of the books to be published. With that killer cliffhanger lurking in the back of my mind. I'm prepared for anything, I told myself. I was not. anywhere near. prepared. for anything past 75 percent of the book. Holy sh*tsticks. They rattled my cage to see if I'd bite. When they released me, they'd see that the answer was yes. Final rating: 4.5 stars ...more 4.5 stars I found this one to be a bit slow at times but it did definitely deliver as far as the creepy twisted plot. I love trying to figure out what's going on. Also really love all the characters but sometimes I just got so frustrated wanting people to believe Mara!!! Well wasn't this a pleasant surprise! After being hugely disappointed with the way the first book turned from fabulously creepy to annoyingly romancy, I did not hold very high hopes for its sequel--even though I was (obviously) curious enough by the ending to still be looking forward to it. As you can tell, I had a very up and down relationship with that book. Fortunately, this sequel rocked it way harder than I could have hoped for! From terrifying hand-made dolls (Dolls. Are. Terrifying!), to d Well wasn't this a pleasant surprise!

As you can tell, I had a very up and down relationship with that book. Fortunately, this sequel rocked it way harder than I could have hoped for! From terrifying hand-made dolls (Dolls. Are. Terrifying!), to dead crows dropping from the sky(!!!), to mental hospitals (the ones with the freaks!), The Evolution of Mara Dyer puts the creep in creepy! <--Win! I mean, someone watching her sleep! That has to give you the heebie-jeebies! (Hear that Mr. Cullen!!?) This part is was I enjoyed the most from the first book and was doubly glad to see again in an even higher degree in this sequel. The pacing was a great match as well with the perfect amount of spine chilling happenings that kept me positively glued to it all. To balance it out, we get some fantastic humor that made me burst into laughter more than once! I especially adore Jamie's sarcasm! Even Noah made me laugh - which is in high contrast to my initial reaction to him. And this time, the romance did not give everything else a back seat. It's still largely present, but, surprisingly, I even enjoyed that part! The romance in the first book completely threw me off. I didn't like the love interest; I got annoyed by Noah's perfectness coupled with an arrogant attitude. But worst of all, a deliciously creepy plot was forgotten for this uninviting romance. So colour me surprised when I found myself pleasantly enjoying the romance in this installment. Not only did I not remember why I didn't like Noah at first--which I'm sure helped a ton--it is kept a part of the plot, not squashing it. Plus, Noah's character has clearly grown, he's good to Mara. He grounds her when she's feels she's falling off the brink of insanity; I really liked that about him. I also thought the chemistry between the two was absolutely electric. Another disappointment in the first Mara was the whole non-answer to her \"power\". She just was. It felt so bland after all the scenarios I had been wildly imagining. I shouldn't have come to such quick conclusions, however, as we delve into some very intriguing and super interesting plot development that gives a much more satisfying answer to that part of the story. Although we didn't get all the answers in this one either, but at least I know there is one better than \"just because\". Aside from some blatantly obvious \"twists\" where I cursed Mara for not having put two and two together sooner, I highly enjoyed this sequel and I'm incredibly happy I gave it a try after my less than enthusiastic response to book 1. For fans of the first, you will love it I assure you, for non-fans of the first, you will more than likely love it too! -- An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.

If so, do you remember that one scene where the woman was in the foreground of her house, panicking, and in the background you see one of the white-masked strangers inside her house, watching her? Such a simple and subtle scene, that was. There was no music, no big bang to draw your attention to the stranger - nothing. Just complete and utter silence, aside from the sound of the woman taking short, panicked breaths. The subtlety of that one particular Have you ever seen the movie The Strangers ? If so, do you remember that one scene where the woman was in the foreground of her house, panicking, and in the background you see one of the white-masked strangers inside her house, watching her? Such a simple and subtle scene, that was. There was no music, no big bang to draw your attention to the stranger - nothing. Just complete and utter silence, aside from the sound of the woman taking short, panicked breaths. The subtlety of that one particular scene, and the fact that if I weren't expecting a big bang as per usual in horror movies and looking in the background for the big shocker, I would have probably missed the stranger standing there, watching her, made that scene more terrifying to me than it would have been if there had been the big bang and the loud music drawing my attention to the background. My whole point for describing that one particular scene in this review was to make a point that for me, subtlety in horror is more scary and effective than anything else. At times, when watching horror movies, in your face scenes with incredibly loud music do entertain me, and, at times, scare me (most notably in the movie Insidious ), but usually, for a scene to linger with me and make me lose sleep, the scene has to be subtle - so subtle that I could miss it. Just like that scene in The Strangers . And that is where I feel The Evolution of Mara Dyer took one large misstep concerning its creepy elements. There are, of course, other faults in the novel, such as the fact that I found it to be way too long drawn out in the second half and that it ends in yet another cop-out of a cliffhanger to stretch out the series when everything could have easily been resolved in this book, but I think the 'in-your-face' creepy scenes may have been the most prominent and effective detraction to my enjoyment in The Evolution of Mara Dyer . In my pre-review, I wrote that the creepy scenes in this book were like someone was banging pots and pans while screaming at me to look at something - with no subtlety whatsoever. (I'll attach my pre-review below this review, for those who are curious to read it.) Clearly Hodkin's intention with these scenes were to freak readers out and to have them lose sleep, and it probably will freak many readers out as some of the scenes are genuinely creepy. There were times when reading this that I was a bit freaked out, but the scene(s) that freaked me out won't linger , and that's really what I'm looking for in horror - for scenes to linger with me. Of course, this is a personal issue for me with this book, and if subtlety - or lack thereof - in scenes intended to be creepy don't make a difference to you, then this will not be a problem for you. However, if you are the type of reader and movie-watcher that I am, where subtlety actually matters then I'd look elsewhere for your ideal Halloween read. That isn't to say you should skip reading this entirely, though, because I'd definitely recommend it to quite a few people. If you, like me, were in love with the plot of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer but were less than enthused by romance completely overthrowing the plot, you will be relieved to know that The Evolution of Mara Dyer is much more plot-focused and less romantically involved than its predecessor. While I did think that there may have been too much plot, to the point where things got completely out of control and crazy, I found it to be entertaining nonetheless. Unfortunately, there are also a few negative similarities between Evolution and Unbecoming , such as the fact that both are way too long drawn out to the point of frustration, having the reader (ie: me) wondering when the book will come to an end, and more importantly hoping it will finally come to an end. And while I did thoroughly enjoy - maybe even love - the first half of The Evolution of Mara Dyer , I found that it lost its way in the second half, leading up to a disappointing finale ending with, you guessed it, another huge cliffhanger. But this time, unlike the first, I don't have much hope for the Mara Dyer series anymore. The cliffhanger at the end of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer left me with a feeling hope that the series would eventually become awesome over time, and more importantly it made me care for what would happen next. But the difference this time is that I don't care, and I think that is the biggest thing I can say about my enjoyment in this series thus far: that I just don't care anymore. Pre-Review I probably won't be reviewing this, because I've already tried and it frustrated the hell out of me, but what you need to know was that this book, like its review which remains unwritten, frustrated the living hell out of me. I enjoyed the ride throughout the first half, finding it to be creepy and mysterious, but as I hit the fifty percent mark I found myself soon bored by the cliche happenings that were just trying too hard. For things to be creepy to me, they must be subtle, and not \"WHOA - LOOK OVER THERE! SOMETHING CREEPY'S HAPPENING! NO, SERIOUSLY, LOOK OVER THERE. YOU'RE GOING TO MISS THIS. GOD DAMMIT LOOK OVER THERE SOMETHING'S HAPPENING! *bangs pots and pans* LOOOOOOOK!\". And that, my friends, is what The Evolution of Mara Dyer 's creepy elements felt like to me. They were trying too hard to get my attention and to freak me out, and I think it goes without saying that it did not. Some of the happenings were interesting, but there were just so many of them that each time something new happened I found myself rolling my eyes. And, similarly to its predecessor, The Evolution of Mara Dyer overstayed its welcome, which is probably the main reason I was so frustrated by it. The first half was fun to read, but the second half, to me, was so boring and repetitive and never-ending that I found myself skimming pages. And all of the \"creepy\" happenings led up to an incredibly anticlimactic finale that, once again, ends in a pretty sizable cliffhanger. But the thing is, I don't really care anymore. The cliffhanger at the end of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer had me caring about what would happen next, even if I didn't like the entire novel. The ending of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer made me have hope that the series would get better and more plot-related. And while I can say that The Evolution of Mara Dyer is an overall stronger companion to Unbecoming , I just can't bring myself to care anymore. I know a lot of my friends will really enjoy this, and some already have , but it frustrated me with its repetitiveness, its overly long drawn out stay, and its shoddy attempt at adding another installment with a cop-out cliffhanger when everything could have been resolved in this book, or even the first. But the difference is this time I won't be suckered into reading the next installment. First half: 4.5 stars Second half: 2 stars Final verdict: A very unsure 3 stars (don't go by my rating, go by my review, it's more accurate) (view spoiler) [And god I hope Noah's really dead. Of course he's not but man that'd be just great. (hide spoiler) ] ...more I really wasn't expecting this to be better than the first book!! The action was perfect, the romance great, the side characters amazing, the plot twists perfectly done. I think the first book was just a little too slow for me, not enough of the paranormal aspect...but now I feel it was appropriate because we needed the intro and back story...but everything about book 2 was just amazing and captivating. \u201cI\u2019ll walk forever with stories inside me that the people I love the most can never hear.\u201d O.M.G. I mean THIS BOOK IS AWESOME! I can't even start putting into words my feelings at the moment I finished this book. This woman was able to mess with my mind.

Even when she tries to tell the true that is taking her sleep away, nobody believes her. Not even I believed her. I have to \u201cI\u2019ll walk forever with stories inside me that the people I love the most can never hear.\u201d O.M.G. I mean THIS BOOK IS AWESOME! I can't even start putting into words my feelings at the moment I finished this book. This woman was able to mess with my mind. It made me surprised, confused, angry, sad, amused... I DON'T KNOW!!! Basically this girl cannot have a single day in peace. Even when she tries to tell the true that is taking her sleep away, nobody believes her. Not even I believed her. I have to confess that if in the end she was just completely insane and everything was a lie, I wouldn't be so surprised. But right now, I can believe how the story developed. I mean, I have a lot of complains... The first one is about her family. With everything that is happening to her, and to them, it's hard to have someone on her side. \u201cBut when everyone tells you you're crazy and no one believes you when you swear you aren't, a small part of you will always wonder if they're right.\u201d And her mother... I know she is just worried and trying to help, but I just couldn't stand her. Still, I'm really hoping that Daniel, her brother, would just discover everything and try to help her. Or at least give her the benefit of the doubt. He is one of my favorite characters over the story and their confidence in each other is so touching! \u201cI wish she knew that I think she\u2019s the most hilarious person on Earth. And that whenever she\u2019s not home, I feel like I\u2019m missing my partner in crime. I wish she knew that she\u2019s really Mom\u2019s favorite, the princess she always wanted. That Mom used to dress her up like a little doll and parade her around like Mara was her greatest achievement. I wish Mara knew that I never minded, because she\u2019s my favorite too.\u201d All this nobody-believes-me situation makes Mara lie to the world. \u201cI pulled out my sketchbook to work on an asinine project I\u2019d been assigned: pick an emotion and draw it. I wanted to draw a raised middle finger, but I would draw a kitten instead. Normal people love kittens.\u201d Creating a mask separating what she meant and what she had to mean. What she was and what others expected her to be. And how free every one of us want to be and are judged or labeled as different. \u201cEveryone is a little crazy. The only difference between us and them is that they hide it better.\u201d The only person she can count with, and I'm really glad, is Noah. His character development was really thought. I still have my problems with him even though a lot was explained. I hate how sometimes I can't feel him and others he is all full of cheesiness. \"I would rather die with the taste of you on my tongue than live and never touch you again. I\u2019m in love with you, Mara. I love you. No matter what you do.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re only seventeen,\u201d \u201cFuck seventeen. If I were to live a thousand years, I would belong to you for all of them. If we were to live a thousand lives, I would want to make you mine in each one.\u201d And I still hate how he makes Mara feels so insecure and all Mary Sue. But still, he is really helpful to the story and I couldn't resist to his charm. Specially when we get to see more about his true self. \"He still looked like an arrogant prince. But only now could I see that his crown was broken.\" Jamie is also back. However, differently from others YAs, I loved how here there's only the friendship and respect. There are no forced feelings and Jamie has his own demons to fight. He is not there for the purpose of destroying the leads' love story. He is truly alive. \u201cWe are far too screwed up for a goddamned love triangle.\u201d And even though it's starting to be a cliche to have THE different character to get the readers to be amused about how authors are giving attention to others than blue-eyes-blondes, I still loved Jamie. \u201cWords have power. And I may be privileged and have a higher IQ than any of our former teachers, but when people look at me? They see a black, male teenager. And there is nothing quite as frightening to some folks as an angry young black man.\u201d We are also introduced to many other incredible characters that give us many secrets. Some of them are good. Some are bad. \u201cSometimes, the biggest secrets you can only tell a stranger.\u201d Still, the characters were well written and some were nicely complex. Strangely enough, even though they were insane, I kinda liked them. \u201cIt\u2019s for the voodoo doll, It looks just like you.\u201d You can\u2019t respond to a statement like that. There\u2019s just nothing to say. Like before, I must praise the writing style. It's witty and has a small amount of irony and comedy. It has beautiful and meaningful quotes that made me enjoy my reading even more. Again Hodkin made me doubt my mind through the unreliable narration. I really enjoyed all the mystery and twists. With all the tension and madness, this book was able to blow my mind. I seriously think that even though people talk a lot about the final book being horrible, I would still recommend this series for those who are in for unexpected turns and mixed feelings. And be prepared for lies. \"You will love him to ruins.\u201d All the pain I had ever felt was just practice for this moment. ...more Final rating: 3.5/5 stars This was the boy I loved.

Now that i had idea what was going on, i started to suspect a lot of things and to have my theories, but i don't think i have guessed them. i was close but i didn't see that coming in the end. That ending... everything there is suspicious, because Mara didn't witness it so it doesn't mean it actually happened, so i don't believe it. It was a massive cliffhanger, but surprisingly it didn't affect me in any way, because i could have seen it coming. Once again, the problem i had with this book is the longevity of it. It is always unnecessary long, some may not agree, but there were many useless parts which i didn't find amusing or dramatic or anything. They were just boring. \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf But the story this time surprised me, with some plot twists and turn arounds, and i was quite immersed into it. I won't reveal much about the story, since i don't know how i would write the synopsis but it was creepier, weirder and definitely better than The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer . But those India flashbacks were quite annoying because i don't understand their point. Or i just couldn't care less. But the worst thing: i need the answers because now i feel like i have been given more questions than answers!

Noah's parents on the other hand were ... absent... they didn't have any point except to tell us how Noah feels because of them. I loved Daniel , he is just so freaking adorable and awesome, and i must say that i loved Jamie too, though he should give chances sometimes instead of reacting. Other female characters were either crazy or bat*hit insane, or just wrong. I don't think there was any normal girl aside from Mara...if she can be considered normal anyway.

We know from the above quote that something shady is cooking up in his research . This oddity comes up once again when Noah mentions that his father needs security. Why? It would seem that the biotechnological work that his father doesn\u2019t isn\u2019t so simple. Once again, the company is insinuated to dabble deeper in something that is not quite\u2026 moral . \u201cA euphemism for \u2018playing God,\u2019 according to the religious and environmental groups that hate his subsidiaries.\u201d Quite odd, that is. David Shaw is implied to be a person who enjoys manipulating natural forces, a man \u201cplaying God\u201d . Let\u2019s diverge a bit and jump to the medical transcript at the end. What struck me as out of place were the words on both Lowe sibling transcripts: \u201cartificially manifested, Lenaurd Protocol, early induction\u201d . Why artificial? When you think artificial, one would think against nature --as though someone defied the natural world, played God as they say. Not to mention the Lenaurd Protocol . The word protocol is commonly associated with experimentations and programs, one that could potentially military. But the most significant part was \u201cearly induction\u201d . Jude desperately wants Claire back\u2014but why? Why not his family? Why not his old life? What is his endgame? When questioned by Mara, his answers always come full circle\u2014back to Claire. \u201c \u2018What about your family?... \u2018Claire was my family.\u2019 Jude\u2019s voice was different now. Less harsh.\u201d This naturally got me thinking. Why would he give no care to the wellbeing of his mother and father, who mysteriously evaporated upon the deaths of both siblings? Why of course! Unless Claire was his only true family . Early induction --whatever experiment they were entangled in, they were in it together . Either both were orphans\u2014related or not, I have no answer to\u2014or were both joined together in the origins of this \u201cartificial manifestation\u201d . Could they perhaps be the first byproducts of a genetic mutation? I\u2019m thinking that the two either originated and were artificially formed, or were experimented on, so as to encompass the G1821\u2014genetic experimentation that defied nature and defied God. A couple of you have mentioned the link between the genetic code and Jude and Claire\u2019s address: 1281 Live Oak Court. I think this cracks onto something. If Jude and Claire truly identified with this experiment\u2014G1821\u2014then perhaps this is reflected in their address. If they had no one else but each other then 1821, or it reversed, would, to them, be like home --a place of shelter, and a place of cultivation. Then one would begin to think, Jude and Dr. Kells seem to be in it together. Dr. Kells mentions a blind study. But studies must be financed . This study went through a hell of an effort to conjoin all these counterparts together, one must stop to think: who is funding it? . And the only person that I can stop to think of now with that kind of cash is Daddy Warbucks, a.k.a the lovely David Shaw. I\u2019ve also come to convince myself further that biotechnology is involved. In the beginning of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer , Mara implies that the following events are told following their occurrence. She states that she is in New York City. \u201cI\u2019m afraid David\u2019s in New York at the moment\u201d That\u2019s right. Guess whose papa heads an office in NY: Noah. The note forewarning the series has Mara mentioning her \u201clawyer\" . Why have a lawyer, and why, pray tell, would she also be in NYC. Unless, we get a hopeful conclusion. Or unless she\u2019s suing the hell out of a certain biotechnology giant for unlawful, unmoral, unethical genetic mutative experimentation. But then you begin to wonder, what does David Shaw get out of this? What could possibly be his endgame? Now I couldn\u2019t possibly tell you that, but I\u2019ve sure as hell had a long think over it. Here is when Granny Mara becomes a central figure. Granny Mara went to Cambridge. Granny Mara went to Cambridge and studied at Darwin College. Darwin College was a tribute to Charles Darwin, the one and only Darwin who penned the literary genius and scientific work of art, On the Origin of Species . That\u2019s right, this was the very work that explored the idea of natural selection and genetic superiority, one that has aided in the segregation of the weak from the strong; an evolution of society. What are the odds? Genetics, once again. The Mara Dyer series deals with kids who have advanced abilities, ones that have left them superior to the rest of the human race. Darwin College is graduate-only, and it assumed to be the place where Granny Mara did her PHD. It is established that Granny Mara knew Noah\u2019s mother, but it is also suggested that perhaps she could have known his father as well. But father remains an enigma: \u201c \u2018Can you ask your dad? Maybe he remembers this.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018He won\u2019t talk about her.\u2019 Noah\u2019s voice went voice went flat. \u201c Granny Mara was at Cambridge for her PHD, and yet she never finished. \u201cShe was in school for her PHD, but she never finished. I think that always bothered her.\u201d If it bothered her, then what could have been so detrimental that it stopped her from completing her doctorate? Granny Mara also then becomes very, very paranoid, but what could have induced such a thing? \u201c\u2026when she went inside to pay, a man asked me for directions\u2026And just as he got back in his car and drove away, your grandmother ran out. She wanted to know everything\u2014what he wanted, what he said\u2014she was wild\u201d Perhaps she was running from something, from someone . A man? What if, in her liaison with Noah\u2019s mother, and possibly his father, she became entangled in a genetic experimentation? But entertain this thought: what if it went wrong, if she got cold feet and if she realised its ethical implications? Cold her paranoia be induced out of a fear of David Shaw? Now if we labour under my theory here and assume that Dr. Kells is under advisement from David Shaw, then it would explain why she was at the asylum, recording the video of the building\u2019s collapse. If Granny Mara became paranoid then she must have had something to hide. But this something could just as easily have been a someone . If she was involved in any form of genetic experimentation, especially in the field of study genetic superiority and genetic anomaly, and her genetics were central (esp when comparing Granny Mara, Noah's mum and his father, Granny would be the oldest of the group, perhaps making her genes more \"original\" then the others) then for anything else to continue they would need a descendent from Granny Mara. Someone who possessed the same genetic mutation. Her own daughter did not exhibit any special abilities, and she was very cautious of this, but what if she recognized Mara\u2019s ability, and as a precaution, decided to cut all links of association between herself and Mara, to keep her safe . There is little to link Granny Mara to Mara in the first place. Granny Mara refused to have photographs taken and Mara\u2019s last name is her fathers. So what if Jude and Claire, the mysterious brother and sister, were charged with infiltrating Rachel and Mara? They would not have been sure that Mara was the correct descendant of Granny Mara (a seemingly original carrier of G1821). I think the asylum collapse was a setup\u2014a test of Mara\u2019s ability. One she passed, but at a cost. It would validate Jude\u2019s anger, because perhaps Claire was not meant to die. They underestimated Mara\u2019s power, and perhaps Claire was a cost\u2014one that now fuels Jude\u2019s retribution. You guys are probably thinking if David Shaw is so central to the plot then why have Noah in the way. But think about\u2014Noah\u2019s supposed death has eliminated him from the chessboard. He has been eliminated from this chase for Mara. When probed about what David Shaw thought of his son\u2019s relationship with Mara, Noah replied: \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m a fool\u201d That can be taken with several meanings, but the one I like to think is he\u2019s a fool, because now he has become central to the plot. David doesn\u2019t want his son mixed in with this, and thus he is eliminated from the game. Despite everything, I still think science is so integral to the overall endgame. Why else would it be mentioned so much. We, the audience, are so occupied by the supernatural shenanigans, the impossible and the love component that when science sneaks it\u2019s way in, perhaps we just don\u2019t regard it as much. It is so minute, yet it is the minute details that count. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s science\u2014\u2018 \u2018It\u2019s madness,\u2019 he said. \u201c \u2018Why do you keep reaching for science?\u2019 \u2018Why do you keep reaching for magic?\u2019\u201d These are just some thoughts to think about. I\u2019ve rambled and this is the length of an essay now. An essay of incoherent thoughts. Brilliant going Jess. Ps. This may be edited from time to time, purely when I think of new things or if I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019ve left a particular thing out. PPS. There's more, kids. I'm just rolling up to 3am and pretty much too exhausted to piece together coherent sentences. The first of many forthcoming edits: A Clockwork Orange edition In the preview of The Retribution of Mara Dyer cork board, a particular image caught my eye. (Click here for said image: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0PY4ZEG2oqs... ) That image right at the centre bottom, a cog eye . Now that struck me straight away. I don\u2019t have a photographic memory and what a blessing it would be if I did have one. Instead I remember semblances of certain things, and in my mind I can link them back to certain places, or locations, of where I\u2019ve seen them (tangent, I know, but essentially it\u2019s like if you asked me for a definition of a concept I wouldn\u2019t remember, but I would remember the concept you want to find and remember it\u2019s location in a book, eg. on the right hand towards the top of a page in the first third of the book). I had one of those moments. Now of course I\u2019ve seen that image. It\u2019s the cover of the controversial A Clockwork Orange . How odd, it would seem, to include the image of such a book, but then I did some research. In the introduction to the 1986 publication of the novella, Burgess wrote the following: \u201cBy definition, a human being is endowed with free will. He can use this to choose between good and evil. If he can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange\u2014meaning he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil or (since this is increasingly replacing both) the Almighty State. It is as inhumane to be totally good as it is to be to ally evil. The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate. Life is sustained by the grinding opposition of moral entities.\u201d Notice in particular the line \u201cHe has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God\u201d . Jude\u2019s appearance depicts a character who is seemingly \u201charmless\u201d\u2014an All-American boy. He is the orange. As we\u2019ve seen him, Jude seems only capable of performing evil deeds. He has been a one dimensional character, only slightly vulnerable at the mention of his sister Claire. In that way, it would seem that Jude is a clockwork orange \u2014at the mercy of being \u201cwound up by God\u201d (and let\u2019s reiterate, who likes \u201dPlaying God\u201d ? David Shaw). There are times where Jude\u2019s speech is described as being \u201dmechanical\u201d almost as though he has no control over what he does. Seeing how impassioned Jude is, motivated by his sister, one would think that he would want simple retribution\u2014Mara\u2019s life for Claire\u2019s. So why is he insistent that Mara has the capability to bring Claire back to life? Jamie\u2019s medical transcript states him as \u201cmanifesting, induced\u201d . Mara\u2019s has a simple \u201cmanifesting\u201d . It would seem that whilst both have shown signs of abilities, Jamie may have had his limits and ultimate capacities induced , whilst Mara is in the process of being induced\u2014as though this is all a test. Essentially A Clockwork Orange deals with the ultimate question: is mankind better off being \u201cevil\u201d, but at their own free will, or being conditioned to be good? In Mara Dyer, the essence of this is kept, but it is twisted and played around with. A Clockwork Oranges inaugurates the notion that perhaps the chosen evil is the lesser evil, purely because there was a moral choice. Jude seems to have lost his moral choice\u2014the thought death and destruction doesn\u2019t keep him awake at night. Without moral choice, a human ceases to be anything but mechanical. Mara, Noah and the rest represent the \u201cnatural man\u201d, born \u201cunlimited, unrepressed\u201d, and perhaps they hold the key to where Jude went wrong. If he has been artificially manifested, should he not be conditioned as good? He is a double whammy of defiance, an experiment gone wrong, for he has not moral choice, and yet has chosen evil. This perhaps may be why they are so desperate for Mara. There may be something in her genes that hold the key to artificially inducing superior genes, without the mechanical cost. I don\u2019t know if I even make sense, but I must come back and think a bit deeper about this point. Oh hey, I didn't forget about this. I've been thinking in the AMs lately and I've deduced something fishy about Daniel Dyer. So have this edit. Now I understand that I may be hitting a sore spot for many here. I tread lightly when it comes to sibling accusations. But after relentless badgering from a friend, it seems that I can\u2019t deny it any longer. There is something off about our dear Daniel Dyer. Hints. Clues. Details. That\u2019s what my life has been surrounded by. My mind reads a sentence and it catches the most minuscule insignificant detail, because that\u2019s just how it works. Sometimes I think \u201cmaybe if I hoard this away, it\u2019ll come in hand\u201d (in reality this hardly plays out, in the fictitious world, it\u2019s a skill that comes in handy). The position Daniel plays in all of this? I think he\u2019s her watcher . It\u2019d make him feel significant. Life has always revolved around Mara (at least in the recent years) and for a child with the brilliance of Daniel\u2019s capacity, that can hurt. A lot . Jealousy brews terrible things. It drives loved ones against one another. It causes betrayal. It fractures worlds. Daniel\u2019s jealous of Mara. Read between the lines. What seems to be a sibling comforting the other could be interpreted completely differently. Case in point: \u201cI wish Mara knew that I\u2019m jealous of her.\u201d While we\u2019re on that topic, Daniel is quite the expert when it comes to lying. I would find y\u2019all the excerpt but this extra edit is coming at a time when procrastination is highly attractive, but not attractive enough to spend an hour looking for a needle in a haystack. But have this instead: \u201c...but as Daniel entered the room he expertly masked his concern.\u201d \u201cI said, unable to help my smile. Daniel flashed one of his own\u2014a real one, this time.\u201d So he\u2019s a master at emotions. What differentiates the real Daniel from his facade? Which one is the facade? Daniel also comes to have ownership of two things: New Theories in Genetics and Mara\u2019s crazy journal . Despite being mysteriously elusive, Mara\u2019s journal ends up in Daniel\u2019s room of all places, jacked up with evidentiary support for her supposed hallucinatory state. But why Daniel\u2019s room? This question is left unanswered because we jump from one shock finding to another. Before we can process the journal, it turns out Daniel has New Theories of Genetics in his possession as well? Why? It seems a tad odd to store a book in your closet of all places. Daniel explains that he wants to separate what\u2019s his from what\u2019s hers but who stores things in their closet (apart from clothing) unless they don\u2019t want it to be found (I\u2019m so sorry if you do. No judgement here, guys.) And then there\u2019s the matter of 1984. Call me paranoid. Whatever. But since Orwell made a mark on me early on in my teenage years, I can\u2019t help but shake the image, the metaphor of Big Brother . Big Brother is always watching . What I\u2019ve deduced is that Mara has a watcher. She\u2019s being taped inside her own house. Sure, Jude could have been the one who installed it (hell I can\u2019t remember that scene anymore, forgive me if it\u2019s been explained), but who else has better access than the occupants of the house. Is it a coincidence that Daniel\u2019s keys are the ones that go missing? \u201cDaniel had kept a big-brotherly eye on me ever since\u201d Sure, that could mean that he\u2019s a fantastic brother and I\u2019ve just slandered him (sorry), but who knows? Big Brother, to me, has been tainted. Could he be watching her? Detailing her every move? Who knows, kids. I\u2019ve been thinking lately (and also sleep deprived). The mind does funny things. We\u2019ll find out, soon enough. ...more 3.75 stars The Evolution of Mara Dyer is the second installment in Mara Dyer series. This book will show you that madness is real.

Right now, the next book is on my kindle and I'm ready to read the end of this trilogy to find out the answers that being left unsaid. Mara Dyer in this book is not better than the previous one with those hallucinations, she thinks her ex is back but her parents and doctor don't believe her. She's sent to the outpatient program at Horizons, so she tries to be normal and control herself not to freak out in front of her family. Noah Shaw is the one who believe in everything Mara tells him and he's trying to protect her at all costs. He's obviously a Gary-Stu in my opinion. The romance in this book is intense. Noah wants Mara to conquer her demon and come to him. I love this kind of relationship and hope that they'll find their HEA in the next book. \u201cI want YOU to be the one wanting me first.

The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer was enchanting and exciting, but this one was ADDICTING. There are more twists and turns and exciting parts in this book then there are on a roller-coaster ride. One thing is for sure, once readers put this one down, they'll definitely need some time before picking up any other book. Mara in this book, was let's just say, funny and in a way messed up as she was in the last book. If you thought her life in the was mind-wracking, confusing, and weird, then her life in the second book just got a whole lot crazier. There are ex'es stalking her, crazy dolls appearing everywhere, nervous and paranoid parents, and a bunch of other voodoo-istic/creeptastic events transpiring in her life which she seems to have lost control over. But then again, she does have her amazing and totally drool-worthy hunk of a boyfriend Noah Shaw to keep her sane and grounded. The one most important thing I loved about Mara was that, even though her life just decided to spiral towards cookoo-ville, she remained strong, optimistic, loyal, (insert many other synonyms), and stayed true to herself. Okay, I've decided that I'm going to dedicate an entire gushy paragraph to Noah Shaw just because this boy deserves it! Seriously! Mara is the luckiest fracking girl in the world to get a guy like him. Number on, he's loyal, insanely loyal. So much so that even when Mara tries to shrug him off (for reasons which will be explained when you read the book), he says that he will stay by her side and no matter what consequences are thrown at them. He always stands by Mara and is there when she needs him. Number two, although he may not seem it at first glance, he is actually extremely sweet and kind. Meaning, romantic dinner dates, security guards, 24/7 availability, and just...ARGH! Perfect I say! LOL. Number three, HE. IS. FUNNY. WITTY. AND A COMPLETE HEART-STOPPER (Ok, that might've been more than three things, but who's counting?). Without him, this book would not have been complete in the least. Overall, the plot-line was crazy, twisted, unexpected, and a hell of a marvelous ride. Pieces of information were thrown at you one after another and sometimes, even though it was hard to keep up with, Miss Hodkin made it possible. There was drama, intrigue, action, craziness (which I will keep repeating because this will never stopping recurring when it comes to Mara Dyer books), humor, and an amazing romance. I'd love to go back in time to experience this journey once again. WARNING: THE ENDING MIGHT JUST KILL YOU. ...more OH MY FREAKING- WHY DO YOU LEAVE ME HANGING LIKE THAT, WHY!? I just *sigh*....

I loved how the character Daniel creates a fictional story about Mara that he comments on, which is really this book making a commentary on itself. He points out red herrings and references Don Quixote's narrative and I found it extremely clever of the author to work those thing in. This series is an onion, I keep pulling back more and more layers even thought it's been weeks since I finished. Ultimately, I didn't enjoy the tornado of angst that Mara and Noah go through in this book, but I thought the series was worth sticking out. The last book ended up having quite an intelligent literary commentary that I really enjoyed. I have a full series review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXlbX... --Original review from Jan 8, 2016-- Ehhhh. Mara. Just when I think I have you figured out, you confuse me more than ever. To be quite frank, I'm pretty tired of this series leading you in 2 or 3 different directions only to pull the rug out from under you at the last minute and go in a new direction. It's a river full of red herrings. And none of it makes any darn sense. The saving grave is that these books are such quick reads! My curiosity wins out, I must finish the series. ...more Before reading: OH MY FREAKING GOD THE COVER IS SO PREEETTTTYYYY.

Basically what I am trying to say is Did Noah really had to hold her hand all the time. Mara thinks that she is being stalker, Noah automatically comes and fixs it. Mara has a problem, Noah automatically fixs it with his money or something. The communication between them is good. But can't Mara do something other than wait for Noah. Big disappointment, it's good.Noah is an interesting character. It just left wanting more. Hopefully the next book is better. ...more Even better than the first book but also an even bigger cliffhanger... Moving on to book 3 ASAP! Initial reaction After Completion More like 2.5*. I am rounding it off to 3* because of the absolutely gorgeous covers. That wasn't stupid at all Throughout the book, there were two emotions warring: creepiness and annoyance. I was equally torn between the two and couldn't make up my mind as to what I really felt. Upto 60% of the book, that is. After that as you can perceive from my rating, annoyance won, hands down. Random trivia (Jessie, for ya) I did NOT like the first book, The Unbecoming of Ma Initial reaction After Completion More like 2.5*. I am rounding it off to 3* because of the absolutely gorgeous covers. That wasn't stupid at all Throughout the book, there were two emotions warring: creepiness and annoyance. I was equally torn between the two and couldn't make up my mind as to what I really felt. Upto 60% of the book, that is. After that as you can perceive from my rating, annoyance won, hands down. Random trivia (Jessie, for ya) I did NOT like the first book, The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer . And what is with the title anyway? What has 'Unbecoming' got to do with anything in the book? Um, anyway, it was easily predictable. Cliched. Hackneyed. Overrated. Twilight-ish romance. The one twist was the addition of supernatural element at the verrryyy end of the book, which felt like a lazy attempt at redeeming it, but couln't quite manage. And it irritated me no end. But as bad as it was, it still managed to pique my curiosity over what would happen next. Marginally. Or maybe that was the cover . Whatever. Now, getting to the second installment. Starting with the good part, The Creepiness That wouldn't necessarily sound like something that would make a good part but, believe me you, it was. The book picks right after the first one ended and we find Mara in a facility after her father's shooting. She is prattling about Jude being alive, but no one believes her, pinning that to hallucinations due to PSTD. Subsequently, she is released when she shows signs of improvement. And that is when, it starts getting weird. The actually-seeing-dead-Jude stuff that I had bought earlier, now started to seem a figment of her imagination. I mean, the girl is suffering from severe PSTD which has delusions as valid symptoms, so what's to tell if she wasn't hallucinating all that stuff? She starts sleep walking, losing time and acting like honest-to-God mentally, unstable kid. We, atleast I, did not know what to believe. Or who to believe. What was real and what wasn't. Because there were some really, really creepy elements. And, I guess that was what Hodkin was rooting for. And she succeeded partially. So, that part constituted the riveting, mind fuckery side of the book. Now the bad part, Annoyance The Plot/The Suspense Haywire. Chaotic. Messy. This is the second book and I still don't what the fuck is happening. I mean, a good suspense is healthy for everyone, but not long, drawn-out, far-fetched drama. There is only so much deflection and evasiveness we could handle before it starts getting on our nerves. It was like we were running around in damn circles. It gets exhausting, y'know. We need some answers, for heaven's sake. At some, point I started wondering if I was missing something. I mean like, I was reading some situations twice to get what the hell was happening. Infuriating! The Flashbacks What the fuck? What happened in India? Hugely annoying and senseless, whatsoever. Every time one would come up, I'll be like: Not again. I understand that the third book will be the all-enlightening one, but this is too much. One explanation, one clue, as to what is happening, was that too much to ask? Noah Shaw Yes, I am aware that many girls are absolutely gaga over the boy. And no, I'm not. There something really off about that boy. On the side, he seems a xerox of our great Edward Cullen. -Don't tell the girl anything and make all the decisions on her part as she is too stupid to handle stuff on her own. -Show any and everything revolves around money. -Blame yourself for everything that happens to her because that's oh-so-romantic . -Speak like you are 110 years old. Atleast that was valid one for Edward because he was 110. But Noah? What was his fucking excuse? And on the other hand he played the arrogant, assholian, bad boy who is actually very noble. Oh, and the broken past, of course. Very annoying. Oh, and Noah: Keep that in mind. The Romance HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD. DON'T SCROLL IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK. The Plot Holes Or the questions that better be answered in #3 or I'm kicking someone -Jude's Powers I din't quite understand that part. He has the power to draw the life out of people to sustain himself? Really? So, how come when he supposedly died, he lost the 2 hands? Did they grow back or something? Wierd. -Grandma is immortal? -Dr. Kells was following them in the asylum, at the day of the incident, right? So, does she have powers too? If not, how on earth did she survive the collapse? -If their abilities are acquired, how come Mara's parents are clueless about the whole thing? Wouldn't they know if someone took their daughter, did something to her genes maybe and returned to them? -What was the point of letting Jude in and torture Mara at the end? Wouldn't Dr. Kells be disappointed if something happened to her lab rats? -The people with powers can't be killed? They are immortals too? -What's up with Jude's parents? They never lived there? Are they ghosts? And now, the silliest, most ridiculous part of the book *drumrolls* The Ending WHAT THE FUCK? I know it is supposed to be heart breaking and devastating for us, and I guess it is for some Noah fangirls, but it was far-fetched. And stupid. Of all the people who could have died, it was Noah? With all his healing powers, he died? Are we supposed to be dumb here? Really, people. And another massive cliffhanger. Hodkins could have easily wrapped up the book in this installment. But no, it was dragged out to the third one. *sighs* And, yes, I'm gonna read it. Oh, and the last line of the book: AWESOMESAUCE! Random cover interpretation As I mentioned above, the covers are absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful and haunting. I luurrvvveed them. And I can't resist, I have need to talk about them. Starting with, #1 The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer Okay, I feel like this represents the initial situation when Mara discovered her powers and Noah is trying to protect her and their forever love bla bla bla. #2 The Evolution of Mara Dyer This one is pretty obvious. It feels like drifting away of Noah and Mara. Or probably, Noah dying and Mara trying to save him. #3 The Retribution of Mara Dyer Feels like Noah will somehow keep his promise to Noah and protect her. And he is obviously alive. Duh. And also, how things are somewhat stable now in Mara's life as she reaches the ground. And of course, Happily Ever After for Noah and Mara. Tell me what you think about my interpretation. Does your differ? ...more I've finally realised that this is one of those books, that I just cannot review. But know this. I loved it :D \"I didn't think you had to make the choice you said you made then. But if I did have to choose between someone I love and a stranger, I would choose the one I love.\" REACTION AFTER READING THE BOOK I have mixed feelings about is book. On one hand, I liked all the scary bits , where Mara gets taunted by all these weird happenings, dreams, and creepy bloody messages. But on another hand, I feel totally torn, that I sort of guessed how this book was going to end. Or at least this specific book, no \"I didn't think you had to make the choice you said you made then. But if I did have to choose between someone I love and a stranger, I would choose the one I love.\" REACTION AFTER READING THE BOOK I have mixed feelings about is book. On one hand, I liked all the scary bits , where Mara gets taunted by all these weird happenings, dreams, and creepy bloody messages. But on another hand, I feel totally torn, that I sort of guessed how this book was going to end. Or at least this specific book, not the series. It was suspenseful, but only towards the last part of the book. There were a lot of things that happened in this book, that made me extremely angry. No, it's not about Mara. Mara was fine, not in her most admirable state, but she wasn't my problem. It was the people around her that I hated. Anways, before I go any further, let's go to the summary shall we? HOW IT BEGINS I woke up on the morning of some day in some hospital to find a stranger sitting in my room. THE GIST Like the first book, this one starts with Mara in a hospital again. She seems to have a thing for hospitals. Anyways, yeah, this story starts of with Mara at a hospital, with someone who she doesn't know watching over her. She had no recollection about what happened before ending up in the hospital. She does remember some things, which I'm not going to mention because its a spoiler for the first book, but other than those little details, she cannot remember. After talking to the stranger in her room, she finds out that she has been involuntarily admitted by her parents ... I'm sure you guys guessed it by now... to a psychward, only with a fancier name. LOL. So then, her mum visits and she's very apologetic about why she was here and blah blah blah... She starts to remember and tells her about what happened and why she acted all crazy, but her mum, did not believe her. As usual. fuck that shit I'm not going to go into more details about this because most of it are spoilers from the first book. But what this book mainly focuses on was, Mara being part of this school-like program where she gets the \"treatment\" she needs to cure her of her psychosis and delusions. Aside from Mara's treatment sessions and occasional nightmares, more secrets get revealed on why she and Noah are different. On why they have the abilities that they have. More secrets are revealed. Yey!! Not really. THE CHARACTERS Mara For some reason, I didn't feel as connected to Mara on this book. I understand that a lot of things have been happening around her, and she couldn't grasp on what is real and what isn't, because of all the people around her who believes she's really crazy. You see her struggle with controlling herself. You see her most of the time, win against her fear. But, I feel she has become too dependent on Noah. \"Without Noah, I would be truly completely alone in this. My father might be right. If I lost Noah, I might just lose my mind.\" There was a lot of \"Noah this\", \"Noah that\", \"Can't wait to see Noah\", \"I need Noah\". And No girl. Just no. You have to battle your own monsters girl. Noah can't do all of that for you. I know he promised you that he will protect you, but he can't always be there. I get why she's gotten so dependent on him. It's because he's the only one who believes in her, and I get that. But she crossed over that bar of being too dependent. But on a positive note, I think this is one Michelle Hodkin's way to arc Mara's character and prepare her for the last book , and I applaud that. It's very risky, because it could make or break a readers interest in reading the last book. All in all, Mara wasn't at all bad. It just wasn't my thing to be honest. I prefer my characters to be weak at first then get better, that starting strong, dipping low, then going back up again. Just personal preference. Noah I still love Noah. His character is constant, and I liked that. He has so much self-control and I really admire that. But, he hid a lot more things from Mara on this book and that kind of got him a bit of a shake of the head. I don't get why male characters do that. They make their love interest look weak. It's like they don't trust them to take in a bad news or event. However, Noah takes matter into his own hands. His overprotective side was perfect. Overprotectiveness usually is a bad thing for me, but in this case, he had every reason to be. There's a crazy person who's scaring the shit out of his girlfriend... he should be overprotective. Right? The Other Characters I have to start of with saying I love seeing Jaime back. I think it's one of the things that made me happy in this book. Second thing, I want to say that I hate Mara's parents. I hate them so bad. The things they said, and the things they do and how ignorant they were to the entire thing when part of the secret has been revealed. I hated that. Hate. Hate. Hate. The ghost is a prick. He's not really a ghost but yeah... He's a douche. A stupid person. A violent maniac. Enough said. And I don't trust those doctors. THE ROMANCE I think this is one of the reasons I couldn't give this sequel 5 stars. There was a lot of push and pull going on between Noah and Mara. I liked how their conversations go, especially when they're being silly and teasing each other, but the other aspects, like their togetherness as a couple, it worried me. Noah didn't want to push Mara. Mara wanted to be pushed. So... See my problem here? HIGHLIGHTS - I still found most of the parts that were creepy, were really creepy. I liked the atmosphere the author made when it was on those scenes. - The characters were all three dimensional. None of them fell flat and unnecessary. Everyone played their roles well. Especially the antagonists. They really made me hate them. - Noah Shaw. He yet again, gains a whole point just for existing on this book. - Jude. I hate that person to bits. And that makes him a great antagonist. - And that cover. It looks so pretty. All of the covers for this series is pretty. LOWLIGHTS - This book was pretty slow. Everything about it was slow. I feel that it dragged on some parts and moved too fast on others, like the ending. It dwelt so much on the \"let's-scare-mara\" part that it completely forgot that I need more information on the \"why-this-was-happening-to-mara\" part. - Questions were answered, but too abruptly. I felt that there should have been more time for us to digest what was happening and not just dumping all the information, just to make it at least a bit fast-paced. Nooooo. - The dreams were completely confusing. I hated those. Maybe I'm just stupid, I dunno, but I didn't like those bits. I didn't get what they signified. - The conclusion was revealed in a choppy way. For me at least. The author thrown a bit of information here, then a bit of information again here. Then a big information here. I get that. I think it was there for the suspense part, but... I feel the information was still... lacking. - It was so damn predictable. I knew about Jude. I knew about the other antagonists. I knew that there were reasons why Jaime was back. I knew what that stupid girl who I will not mention about was doing. FINAL RAMBLINGS I reread The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer just shortly before I read this so I could easily compare the two. And I could honestly say, that I liked the first book better in every regard. It was good, but not as good as the first one, hence, the four star rating. I just didn't think everything wrapped up perfectly. I feel there were plenty of plot holes. I get that this is the second book and everything is not supposed to be revealed on this book, but I want something concrete at least and I didn't get that. All I got was, a lot of tiny things that is supposed to make sense, but didn't for me. I wish I liked this book better. I delved into this book with high expectations. Too high though. And I wish I didn't. Will I be reading the last book? Maybe. Or maybe I will, but not right now. It's not at the top of my priority right now. ...more This book was such a mind bender! I literally don't know when to believe what Mara is saying and when to not, she doesn't even know herself! There is definitely a creepy vibe to the book but not so much that I couldn't sleep! If you're looking for a psychological thriller I would recommend this series, I'm cited to finish it off with the last book. A finished unsolicited copy was provided by the publisher for review.

[su_box title=\"How to keep yourself immersed in the book blogging community\"]May contain spoilers if you have not read volume one The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer .[/su_box] We\u2019re back with Mara Dyer and this time she\u2019s sent off to a school for trouble teens called Horizons where they talk about their feelings, do group exercises all under the watchful eye of Doctor Kells and their psychiatrists. It\u2019s an outpatient program so it acts like a school. Her family worries for her but doesn\u2019t believe her, and the one person who does is the one person she shouldn\u2019t trust, her boyfriend Noah. If a book had enough fire and chemistry between two characters, it\u2019d be Mara and Noah. Their passion ingnites the senses and got my heart to pounding in my own chest. That beach scene sounded quite romantic and if there weren\u2019t teenagers I\u2019m sure some bow chicka wow wow would be happening. Secondary characters are sometimes overlooked but honestly I loved Daniel. He is supportive and kind and a great older brother. Mara\u2019s family is completely believable and I love their family dynamics. They really cared for her like a real family would. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that her brother didn\u2019t believe her. If he\u2019s known her all his life, why would she be lying about her hallucinations? Noah is more relevant in this book. You can understand him better. His thoughts are clearly put on paper and you can\u2019t help but wish Michelle Hodkin wrote with alternating viewpoints. I\u2019d definitely gobble up anything that had to do with Noah\u2019s thoughts. He\u2019s not just a pretty face with a hero complex but someone who is also vulnerable especially when it comes to family values. His family is distant and cold, where Mara\u2019s family is warm and friendly. The two vast differences is clearly evident and you can\u2019t help but want to feel sorry for Noah. Overall, the story runs slow in the beginning but picks up in the end. The ending wasn\u2019t as shocking since there was a lot of foreshadowing in the middle but that ending still killed me. More questions are being answered and I can\u2019t wait until the last installment. Creepy, satisfying, I can\u2019t get enough of Mara\u2019s story or Noah\u2019s. One for your shelves everyone. Don\u2019t borrow this, buy it, because you\u2019ll want to re-read it to find out more clues..I know I want to. Character Development A little brief regarding Mara, but we do see a lot more of Noah\u2019s personality. Pacing Slow in the beginning, and finally picks up in the middle. Those romance scenes definitely makes up for it. Cover &Design Beautiful and eerie, yet haunting as well. The typography is gorgeous. Plot So darn interesting, the mystery kept me turning the pages, as well as the chemistry between our two main characters. A beautiful and creeptastic read that will blow you away. That ending..AHH! Go read it now! ...more", "Title": "The Evolution of Mara Dyer"},
