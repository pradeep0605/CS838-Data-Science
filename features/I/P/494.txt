At any rate, it\u2019s a book that you read, either like or dislike, but no sooner than you have turned the last page, it is out of sight and out of mind. Then there is the other kind of book that will touch your heart, or awaken a lingering memory or a potential fear that will haunt your mind so that even long after you\u2019ve fallen asleep, your unconscious self is still wading through the details. Your dreams will be fitful and when you finally awaken, you will find yourself tangled up in sheets with puffy, swollen eyes from tears that you shed when you weren\u2019t even aware enough to know you were crying. <+++>If I Stay</+++> is the latter. Mia is eighteen and has the kind of family any of us would pray to be born to and the kind of boyfriend that can only exist in the fictitious world. Furthermore, she is a gifted musician and is about to be accepted into the prestigious Julliard. Mia has a choice, she can follow her love of music, go to Julliard and accomplish her cellist dreams, or she can stay with her family and the love of her life and follow her heart. Either way, she has something to gain and something to lose. Then, one fateful morning, Mia\u2019s world is turned on its head and life as she knows it changes. The one thing that remains the same is the question that Mia has asked herself for the past few months, should I go or should I stay? In art, the brightest colors appear beside the darkest of lines and in this book, the most endearing, tender and happy moments are surrounded by grief so palpable, that you will laugh through your tears and sob with a smile. <+++>If I Stay</+++> demonstrates the kind of beauty that can only exist alongside despair and shines all the more for it. It is filled with happiness and sorrow, laughter and tears, birth and death, love and loss. By writing a book filled with parallels, Forman proves that life has no opposite and thus leaves readers with an overwhelming since of joy and hope despite tears and grief that they are bound to feel. **Update** I just re-read this book for the forth time and it continues to devastate and delight me. ...<---F>more My impression?

But at the end of the book, I found myself feeling more bored than anything. This book wasn't new, or original, or groundbreaking. It was a way for me to kill time while I waited for my Mom to pick me up from school. I've seen stuff like this novel a million times before, and most of them were a lot more sad. Sorry Forman, but I'm not impressed. EDIT: Guys, I wrote this review in 2010. Do you seriously feel the need to continue commenting on this, when I've been messaged by die-hard fans and fellow haters alike, had to answer every possible argument for or against it, and been criticized for ~daring~ to write a less-than-glowing review on a website whose literal purpose is to review, critique, gush about, and condemn books? Are you honestly that rilled up by a negative opinion? If I Stay just isn't that great. My tastes have changed quite a bit since I read it, and I stand by my opinion. Why do you care? Why are you still whining about it when a simple read-through of the comments will show that I've already addressed your specific complaint? Go away. Write your own glowing review. Watch the movie version coming up (<---B>which also looks terrible, but what do I know</---B>). Go. Leave. I don't care. I do not care.

I almost had to stop reading when one character \"played the other character's body like a guitar\", and I actually did stop reading for awhile when the girl brought out her damn cello bow and started running it along her boyfriend's body. Seriously? Would this ever really happen? I know this is fantasy, but the author doesn't write it like it is supposed to be a dream. The parents were the worst part of the book for me. They were the parents absolutely every teenager in the Western world wishes that they had- cool, young, know music, laidback, had wild young adulthoods, act like teenagers, and are just so damn awesome it hurts. There really is no happy medium in teen fiction- parents are either antagonists or sidekicks these days. The premise was a great one- being able to choose between life or death. And it could've been awesome. But this book was sadly not awesome, it was poorly written and cheesy. ...more *4.5 stars* There is something comforting in that. To go down as a family.

The blood from my chest has seeped through my shirt, skirt, and sweater, and is now pooling like paint drops on the virgin snow. This book is beyond beautiful. It's heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. You'll laugh, you'll smile but you will cry or drop a tear now and then. Tears because you won't be able to believe your eyes at how poignant this is. And how it is a story you'll cherish forever. In my heart, If I Stay will always have a special place. It makes you wish you'd played the cello as our Mia exquisitely does. That's at least true for me, and that is how much these characters and story had an influence on me. What I know for sure is that, after reading this book, you'll take a moment to think everything through. To think about your life and how it isn't easy but that, when you're surrounded by people you love, it's, somehow, easier to cross over all those obstacles life puts you through. Mia sure is constantly sharing wonderful memories with us, but what is so impressive is that the author subtly included a message in each of them. A message to think about. This is the kind of book I wished everyone with a soul would read and see its irrevocably originality and very pleasant and peaceful atmosphere. I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard. What I unfortunately didn't like as much as I hoped to is the author's writing style. I read raving reviews saying how amazing the writing is but, I didn't quite see its amazingness as most people have I guess. It is well-written, of course, with a perfect atmosphere fitting the story and all the emotions of the characters, but so are many many other books I've read. Nothing special on that part for me, sadly. That is the reason I couldn't give this book five stars, but it is the one and only. Everything else was perfect.

It didn't help that his little sister was extremely competitive, precocious and bratty. I think he always believed he didn't have much going for him - but boy he has it where it counts. Back then I thought I was so much smarter than him, and taking up the piano was another chance for me to prove that. Unlike my brother, who had never played an instrument before, I could sight-play and was already studied in the necessary music theory aspects from the violin. And, in form, I was better than him. For a while. Effectively speaking, I always was always going to be better at him in the technical arena. But he was better where it counted. When it came to the heart of the music, bringing a piece alive and making it beautiful - I was completely outclassed. I played like a robot and he played with his soul. This book makes me regret that more now than I've ever regretted it before in my life. If I Stay is a beautifully written, character-driven novel about a girl choosing between life and death. It was also one of the best narrated audiobooks I have ever listened to. Mia's body is in ICU and she is waiting to die. As the events from her car crash unfold, she examines her relationships with everyone to determine whether or not it's worth staying or dying peacefully from her crash. There were parts of this novel that had me weeping, my heart aching and my chest pounding with emotion. Mia's voice, her relationships, her struggles and her pain are so brilliantly related to the audience. The writing isn't perfect. There are some parts that could have been a little more polished. Some paragraphs that probably needed another edit. However, the technical writing aspects are far and above overcompensated by the heart and soul of this novel. This novel is like Mia's Cello. It is beautiful, resounding and emotional. Just as Mia can play Adam like her instrument, so too can Forman play her audience - strumming all the high and low notes with perfect, breathtaking clarity. Without a doubt, Forman has it where it counts. ...more In a single moment, everything changes.

A sophisticated, layered, and heartachingly beautiful story about the power of family and friends, the choices we all make -and the ultimate choice Mia commands. - - - WHY I DROPPED IT: I didn't like the book. I just thought it was completely useless. Nothing was really \"sad\" except times where Mia had to choose between staying/going, etc. And the plot didn't hold my attention -mainly because there wasn't much of a plot in first place. I was a little reluctant to admit I didn't like it in first place. Mainly because so many people loved it, I felt as if I was bursting their bubble. But as time moves forward, a lot of people didn't like it either. So I'm not alone. But before you completely screech at me for not liking such a \"brilliant\" book, I have my reasons. - Mia is too dull for my liking. Sure, she likes music and it's supposed to \"set her apart\" from the rest of the world. Nuh-ah. It doesn't work like that. She's as ordinary/simple as possible. - There isn't much of a plot. Just a girl wondering if she'd rather die or stay. Maybe for a lot of you, it's a wonderful plot. Not for me. Sorry, but recounting isn't my thing. - Which brings me to the third point. This story is the wrong story which is being written. As a writer, I worship the rule, \"If you have to add a lot of back-story to make your book understandable, then you're telling the wrong story.\" I agree. This book is just memories stringed together. Maybe I'm the only one who has a problem with this, if so, forgive me. But I really, really didn't like this. Oh and as for Adam, I didn't like him much either. He seemed the usual \"dark\" type. And one of the things I really hate in romance, is when I can't see why the boy and the girl fall for each other. I do understand they both have the passion for music, but so many other people do. *rant over* Comment all you like. My mind's not going to change. Sorry. ...more I was actually quite shocked to find that this book did not even make me shed one tear. Weird, huh? Unless you count tears of boredom.

Other than the fact that I was bored to tears, I had several major issues with If I Stay . For one, I failed to empathize with a vast majority of the characters. The connection just wasn't there, slightly contributing to my disliking of this book. Identifying with characters is extremely important for me as a reader, especially with these types of books. I did not appreciate Mia\u2019s emotionless voice -which I know was deliberate on the author\u2019s part- because it did not fit this sort of story. The characters in this book were much too perfect. It was palpable from that first (view spoiler) [ and only (hide spoiler) ] scene from the beginning of the book, when the family was all together. It was like those perfect, unrealistic American families you see on T.V. It was pretty painful to read about. If you want to know anything about me, I loathe perfect things. Perfection is boring as hell. Quite often, I found the story to be a bit\u2026 messy. It constantly jumped from one thing to another, much to my irritation. To sum the book up, If I Stay was just a jumbled mess of memories, lacking one necessary ingredient: cohesiveness. I like to compare the plot of this novel to a lost dog. It wanders aimlessly, endlessly, not really going anywhere. More times than I would like to admit, I contemplated giving up the book altogether. I kept questioning why I wanted to continue with this endeavor. One might argue that that was the author\u2019s intent; to show this feeling of aimlessness to symbolize how Mia was feeling. While this is a good idea in theory, all it really does is bore the reader and make them question why they are reading this book. But probably what bothered me the most was the very unsatisfying ending. Whilst reading this, I had inferred that maybe, just maybe, all this suck will cease because the author would write such a brilliant, beautiful, life-changing conclusion that would make me give this book 5 stars without a second thought. That I would be blown off my feet by the brilliance of the ending. Needless to say, my inferring was smashed by how incorrect it was. The one redeeming factor of this book that stopped me from giving it one star was Mia\u2019s passion for music. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a main character as passionate as her, which is one quality of her\u2019s I admired greatly. Maybe I expected the wrong things from this book. Maybe I\u2019m reading into this all wrong, and missing the message by a mile. I\u2019m sorry, I just didn't like the book. Besides failing to move me in any way, it failed to keep my attention, and for that, I simply cannot give this book any higher than 2 stars. For the record, I don't exactly hate this book, but I think it was very undeserving of the hype and that it was merely descent. Not anything special. Others can have If I Stay . I\u2019ll be flaunting my copy of Before I Fall . ...more UGHHHHHH. This book is wrenching! But lovely. With an interesting and unusual narrative. There's a lot of teen romance here, but it was the family dynamic that really did me in. (In a good way.) Books about death and dying are particularly hard to review. The way we react to them is so deeply personal that I'm skeptical about the actual value of my (or anyone's) review of the work to other readers. When we read, we don't come to the book with a clean slate--we come to it with years of experiences, friendships, and memories that provide us with a vantage point from which to view the story.

When we read, we don't come to the book with a clean slate--we come to it with years of experiences, friendships, and memories that provide us with a vantage point from which to view the story. And if you have an awful tendency toward existentialism, like I do, these books only become more emotional as you evaluate your own life,choices, and relationships along with the protagonist. I spent two years of my life moving around the US doing service projects, and most of that time I lived in the gulf after Hurricane Katrina. Living in a tent city and gutting houses for months in what basically felt like a post-apocalyptic world was life-changing for me, but the absolute devastation of the area wasn't what did me in, it was the people. Most of the people whose homes we gutted had not returned from evacuation yet. Their homes had been under 10-12 feet of water for two weeks. My point is this: we threw out almost all of their belongings. Barely anything was salvageable--at the most, we found a few pictures or some of their silver or china. I cannot imagine what it was like for those families. Is it better to come back to a nightmare or to come back to an empty, clean slate from which to start again? I still don't know. But I realized, after speaking to so many residents, that most of their stuff didn't matter to them. They had their lives. Their family. Their connections to other people. I know it sounds cliche, but I feel like it is something that a lot of us tend to forget. Even when it feels like all is lost, there is always something there to hold on to. (view spoiler) [When Kim told Mia her long story of the day and ended it with, \"You still have a family,\" I lost it. (hide spoiler) ] Mia, the protagonist of If I Stay is in the intensive care unit after a horrible car accident. While she is in a comatose state, some part of her (her soul?) is able to see everything that is going on outside of her body. I found it fascinating--so often with an outside watcher, we see a person hovering over their funeral or watching to see what happens afterward. In Mia's case, we were able to follow along with her while she makes her decision to stay or go. I wasn't sure what Mia's choice was going to be, even to the last second, and I appreciated that fact-- <---A>Gayle Forman</---A> gets it. The relationships between the characters felt so real to me, especially because a lot of my immediately family are doctors and nurses so I've spent a lot of time in hospitals. I read an article today about the decline of the \"book review.\" The author was discussing the extent to which people used to depend on critical and objective book reviews for suggestions of what to read and how the number of literary critics has severely decreased. (actual literary critics, not just reviewers)It got me thinking about what I actually look for in a book review. What makes me want to read it? Though I definitely enjoy the NYT Book Review, I am much more likely to buy a book that my friends recommend, on Goodreads or in real life. Give me a subjective book review about what a book made you feel and I am all over it. If you are the same way, you should know: This book made me feel optimistic for the future at a time when I have been feeling completely lost, so for that, it is getting 5 stars. As an aside, I'd just like to add that this book was fantastic in audio format. Once in awhile, cello music played in the background and it was lovely to hear it considering Mia was an amazing cellist. Also, having a person actually read me the lyrics to Mia's father's song and to hear Adam say his speech to her was beautiful. I'd definitely recommend this book in audio format. ...more Despite the general hype about this book, I had my reservations because I had gone into The Lovely Bones with similar optimism and been highly disappointed by a story that never really took off and was simply drab and boring.

To be honest, if you're looking for fast-paced adventure and a really gripping plot then I'm not sure this book is for you. Gayle For Despite the general hype about this book, I had my reservations because I had gone into The Lovely Bones with similar optimism and been highly disappointed by a story that never really took off and was simply drab and boring. After reading the goodreads description for this, I imagined something of the same and could only hope I wouldn't have a repeat performance. To be honest, if you're looking for fast-paced adventure and a really gripping plot then I'm not sure this book is for you. Gayle Forman uses subtleties and beautiful writing to tell her story in a deeply emotional and moving way. She creates wonderful moments from the most simplistic things as playing cello or going to a concert or the protagonist spending time with her grandfather. Where The Lovely Bones was a book about death, 'If I Stay' is very much a book about life and how the small things we overlook are so important. Forman creates the sense that life is always worth living, even when it seems that your whole world is falling apart - if you have nothing else, you still have a friend who'd risk their life for you. Still think your life isn't worth living when someone would disagree to such an extent? The many different relationships in the book are told in varied but equally moving ways. The author shows the intricate relationship between mother and daughter, father and daughter, siblings, grandparents and grandchildren, boyfriend and girlfriend, and just that of a person's closest friend. Mia, a shy cello-player from Oregon with only one close friend, is shown in this book to have a life full of love and things to be grateful for. I found it truly inspiring and heartwarming. I will be reading the sequel, without a doubt. ...more 5 AMAZING STARS \u201cSometimes you make choices in life and sometimes choices make you.\u201d I decided to read this book because I noticed that the movie is coming out the next month!So I thought that finally I must read it!!!And now that I finally finished the second too I'm thinking..Why I didn't start this series sooner???Why????

Original review It is always difficult for me to write reviews for books that do not have any flaws. \"If I Stay\" is one of those books. This story of love and family, of choices and happiness, is just so superbly written, I am a little lost for words. I think the genius of this book is in the realness of the characters and emotions they experience. Not even once do you feel that you are being emotionally manipulated. The story, while tragic, never crosses over into melodramatic or sappy. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed (to my surprise) is music. I am not really a musical person and can't normally relate to music-centered stories, but music is a very vibrant and important player in this book. It brings people together, it changes people's lives, it makes one want to continue living when a person thinks she can't go on. In that respect this book reminds me a little of a movie \"August Rush\" that I also enjoyed to my surprise. Gayle Forman has definitely earned my respect with this book. I don't know if she will be able to duplicate this success, but I am curious to check out her future books.

(Also, haven't read this book since July 2012, finally decided to finish my review... in January 2013. Go me.) If I Stay follows the story of a girl named Mia, with a perfect family who decide to go out into the city on a snow day, and their car crashes, killing everyone in it. Except for the main character, who lingers on as a spirit and has to deal with the fallout of losing her entire family but being unable to do anything about it. There's also flashbacks to her and her boyfriend, concerts, and by the end of the book, her spirit merges back with her body, despite the inner turmoil she has between leaving this world, or living on as an orphan. Maybe it's because I really can't stand 'chick-flicks' such as The Note Book , that this novel just didn't go over well with me. I didn't know too much about the plot, but I just didn't feel sad at all when Mia's family died. It's upsetting when you stop to think about it, but it just didn't get any visceral reaction from me while reading. I think my main fault was with the characterisation of everyone. They are way too perfect. (Well, the dad loses a few points for dissing Alice Cooper and insisting on playing The Ramones instead during the car journey. Just a personal thing.) I mean, the novel starts out like a freaking 'perfect, white middle class American family' commercial. It's snowing outside, but everyone is snug and warm inside. They're making stacks of pancakes and Mia's little brother is saying silly, na\u00efve things. The father is just like: \u201cHehe, you go, sport.\u201d And then we are told that our main female character has incredible musical talent. And her boyfriend Adam is in a band, and he is also musically gifted. Oh, look! The radio announces that there's a snow day! Much rejoicing! Until, of course, the car accident. Now, thankfully, I see Mia as becoming less of an annoying shit-head than Ever Bloom was in Alyson No\u00ebl's novel, in a which a perfect girl also lost her family in a car accident, but I found it an absolute chore to read. Flashback, then Mia being sad at the hospital, then flashback then hospital then... argh. Seriously, it was always some revelation about her out-of-body experience, then it went back to her family, and this kind of narrative just didn't do it for me. The ending was also really dull, and I just felt nothing after reading it, like I had wasted my time. If I Stay had some nice writing at points, though. I also grew to like Mia somewhat after being in her head for all this time, but her boyfriend's behaviour was kind of ridiculous at times. I mean, this is a guy who considers pulling the hospital's fire alarm so that he can sneak into the intensive care unit Mia is in without the nurse noticing. Mia is also guilty of this, since when she sees her grandparents showing up (as her next of kin), she instead thinks of how much she wants to see her boyfriend. What? I'm sure if you like tearjerkers and cozy 'chick flick' books, this one will light up your world. Unfortunately, I'm not about to forgive the boring pacing, the constant flipping between different time periods, and the lack of emotional connection with the characters. 2/5.

The writing sent shivers down your spine, remember? \"And there was so much noise. A symphony of grinding, a chorus of popping, an aria of exploding, and finally, the sad clapping of hard metal cutting into soft trees.\" It was just gorgeous the way the writer meshed Mia's love for music with stuff. Cynical Natalie: Yes, but there's a very big difference between liking something and loving it. We like ketchup, but we looove tartar sauce. And writing isn't the only thing that makes or breaks a story. Marissa Meyer is, for all her accomplishments, a mediocre writer. No offense honestly, but her writing just doesn't sing . Yet I love the hell out of Scarlet and Cress because the characters were fantastic. Nice Natalie: But you thought the characters in If I Stay were great! They were fleshed-out, distinguishable from one another, and the relationships between secondary characters other than the main characters, like her Mom and Dad, were addressed and developed as well. Do you realize how rare that is in a YA book? Cynical Natalie: Harry Potter. Nice Natalie: HP is technically middle-grade. Cynical Natalie: I don't know... I think it stopped being middle-grade four books ago. (screenshot taken from this video ) Nice Natalie: Regardless, you can't use HP as an example. It's like telling the Pope that he'll never be God. They're incomparable. Cynical Natalie: True that. But I still remember Celestina Warbeck even though the last time I visited Hogwarts was in January, but I'm 99.9% sure I won't remember any of the main characters from If I Stay two weeks from now. Speaking of which, what was up with that awkward, albeit beautifully-written, sex/groping scene between Mia and Adam? He was all like, \"Play me like a cello.\" Nice Natalie: It was meant to be a beautiful moment of bonding. Cynical Natalie: You mean like Hazel and Gus making out in Anne Frank's house was supposed to be romantic and poignant? Yeah, all I got from the cello scene was awkwardness and moments of suppressed laughter. Try as I may, I can't picture two socially-conscious teenagers doing what they did. Nice Natalie: First loves are supposed to be awkward. Cynical Natalie: Not to the point where they make me laugh at the ridiculousness. And I didn't cry at all during reading. Nor did I feel sad actually. I only felt guilty because I hadn't reached my writing quota for the day and I was behind on my reading challenge. Nice Natalie: But it's about a girl dealing with the deaths of her parents and brother! And whether she should stay because her life will be miserable if she wakes up. Cynical Natalie: Eh, been there, done that. I don't get why Mia didn't try touching her body to see if her soul would get sucked back in. It always happens that way in movies. That's what I'd do, regardless of everything. But I guess the storyline wouldn't make Mia try that so she can Contemplate Important Life Choices. Plus, the whole book just felt like a very long prologue. It was just a string of memories with a few strays thoughts on whether she should stay. After she finally makes her decision, the book ends, like, \"You wanna find out what happens next? Buy the next book, sucker!\" There's no real closure. Nice Natalie: Do you want to read the next book? Cynical Natalie: Sort of. But I don't like feeling suckered into it. Nice Natalie: If you want to read the next one, that means it did its job! Cynical Natalie: Meh, I guess it did. Still, I won't be rating this higher than a 4. Nice Natalie: Remember those days when we'd give a 4 as long as we enjoyed the book? Cynical Natalie: Yeah... Nice Natalie: I miss those days. Cynical Natalie: Go stand in your corner. Now.

I really didn\u2019t think so. Does a bunch of stories compiled together in an artful way a plot make? Sorry, but no. Not entirely. Despite the mostly absentee plot, the book was actually quite well written. It was artful and even poetic at times. I would say it is worth a read just for the fact that it was so well written. \u201cAnd that's just it, isn't it? That's how we manage to survive the loss. Because love, it never dies, it never goes away, it never fades, so long as you hang on to it.\u201d This book is short . Maybe too short. At the end I was left feeling like the book had been chopped up and I was missing the last couple chapters. I understand that the author did that for dramatic effect. But that knowledge doesn\u2019t help the off-balanced, dizzy feeling I had when I finished, like a rug was whipped out from under me. I read this on audiobook. And the narrator, Kirsten Potter, did an exceptional job. I don\u2019t know if she has such command of her voice to cause it to sound like it was cracking with emotion when the book was at an exceptionally moving point, or if the she was ACTUALLY crying while she was reading those parts. But either way, it was really quite stirring. I haven\u2019t looked to see if she narrates the 2nd book Where She Went, but I have it on hold at the library either way. The audiobook gets 5 stars, the actual story gets 3ish stars. + a little extra credit for a exceptionally well written book and likable characters = A strong 4 stars from me. ...more MOVIE TRAILER \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764 I'm so excited.

On a normal day in the normal life of 17 year old Mia and her mom, her dad and her little brother Teddy...Life derailed and took a different course.....a beautiful snow day turns tragic The story begins. She is a cellist. Extremely gifted and Juillard bound. Mia is in a coma from the accident and the story is her having an out of body experience. It is beautifully written. I was emotionally invested. I only took a break to wipe my tears away. Life is a gift that sometimes we take for granted. Reading this story truly made me realize that its important If I stay. If I live. It's up to me All this talk about medically induced comas is just doctor talk. It's not up to the doctors. Its not up to the absentee angels. It's not even up to God who, if He exists, is nowhere around right now. It's up to me As \"she\" is wandering the halls of the hospital she is looking for her boyfriend Adam. Adam totally won my heart. Singer, song writer, lover of music and most of all totally in love with Mia. Full-throttle, intense, can't-erase-that-goofy-smile type of love. But now that Adam is here, I'm paralyzed. I'm scared to see him. To see his face. If he is crying it will kill me. Forget this is my choice business. That alone will do me in I don't care. I only need a second. So I can show her that I'm here. That someone is still here Like I said, this book provoked a lot of thoughts for me. Lots of emotions. Steady trickle of misty-eyed moments and then some outbursts of full-out WAILING. Anna-Style....where I scare my hubby and he thinks I'm having a seizure. You've been warned. In the quiet corner of the ICU I start to really think about the bitter things I've managed to ignore so far today. What would it be like if I stay? What would it feel like to wake up an orphan? To never smell Dad smoke a pipe? To never stand next to Mom quietly talking as we do dishes? To never read Teddy another chapter of Harry Potter? To stay without them? I'm not sure this is a world I belong in anymore. I'm not sure that I want to wake up Adam~ Its okay. If you want to go. Everyone wants you to stay. I want you to stay more than I've ever wanted anything in my life. But that's what I want and I could see why it might not be what you want. So I just wanted to tell you that I understand if you go. It's okay if you want to stop fighting Adam is mumbling something now. In a low voice. Over and over he is saying: Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Finally he stops and looks at my face. \"Please Mia\" he implores. \"Don't make me write a song.\" STAY If you stay, I'll do whatever you want ......And that would suck, but I'd do it. I can lose you like that if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay And then he takes her hand and she has visions. She sees a future. She hears music.

But like always my curiosity won. If I Stay is a boring story that can be told in few sentences but has been dragged into a 200 page book. If this book were any longer, I would have marked it DNF right after reading the first few chapters. This book is about a girl named Mia who experiences a car accident which kills her parents and presumably her brother. Mia gets stuck in a limbo-like state soon after the accident takes place. Later, she realises that it\u2019s up to her to choose if she wants to live or join her parents while she recounts moments with her family, friends and boyfriend from the past. Here are the problems with the book. The author fails to make this story interesting. I felt detached from the story and constant shifting of Mia\u2019s memories and her present limbo-like state in the hospital. This book offers nothing new; it is filled with clich\u00e9s and has a very predictable plot right from the beginning to the end. Mia\u2019s flashbacks of her past just show me that she\u2019s one of the greatest Mary-Sues I\u2019ve read about. Mia is a Mary-Sue. She has no flaws and depth whatsoever. She\u2019s an obedient and perfect child to her parents, she has a too-perfect-to-be-real boyfriend (who too is another cardboard cut-out crawling through the novel), she has a very happy and problem-free life, she is excellent at academics, she is excellent as a cellist and she has an awesome best-friend (who\u2019s a real meanie to her parents and screams at her mother when the latter started crying upon hearing of Mia\u2019s condition\u2026Ugh! What\u2019s wrong in expressing your sadness over someone\u2019s accident? Are adults not allowed to show emotions?). Not to mention that Mia\u2019s parents were shown to be extremely perfect and cool people whom all teens would love to have as their own parents. They love rock music, they give their children everything they want, they allow them to hang out with their friends and go to parties, they allow Mia to date Adam and barely bat their eyelashes when Mia brings Adam to their house for the first time and takes him to her room alone. I felt that the author deliberately made Mia\u2019s parents all nice and awesome so that readers would feel very sad when they die. And what on earth even happened to Mia\u2019s brother? The author tells us nothing about him other than Mia\u2019s assumption that he must've died too. As if he was just there in the story to let Mia play her very-kind-and-loving BIG SISTER role. This book is full of cheesy scenes like the one where Mia brings the bow of her cello and \u201cplays it\u201d on Adam's body like an instrument. It also had one of the most unbelievable and emotionally manipulative ending ever. (view spoiler) [ Mia is lying in the hospital and her boyfriend comes to meet her.

I had to think about it, for a fraction of a second, before I answered 'because every word is worth it'. Simply, this book wouldn't be the emotional cruncher it is without some superb writing from Forman. Without giving to much away, she makes all characters in this story extremely real. It starts off as many YA stories do, some froth and a lot of great dialogue between Mia and her family. Once that chapter's done, the tone completely changes. Mia and her family are involved in an accident and Mia's trapped in limbo, witnessing the lives of those who care for her, and those she cares for in return, without the power to do anything but watch. Forman walks the line between Mia's recollections and the present with ease. To often a book similar in intent would be manipulative, but I didn't feel this at all. I felt Forman's love for each one of these people, as if they were her own. That Mia's loss, was her loss. The empathy that courses through this book is both inspiring and astounding. Despite the somewhat dark subject matter this is a story of hope, life affirmation and all that it brings. The relationship between Mia and Adam is honest, they might be in love but they have real problems and they aren't all solved with a snap of the fingers. Kim is an amazing best friend, sarcastic and strong her appearances in the book are bold and bursting with love. I particularly love an incident in the playground that was the inception of the girl's friendship. Mia's parents made a huge impression on me, they sounded familiar, as if I had met them but avoiding anything resembling a cliche. The hospital staff, particularly Nurse Ramirez with her biting wisdom and infinite care, also made an impression on me. How much did she really know? Mia's grandparents melted my heart, I have always heard how to outlive one's children is the worst thing imaginable but these two transcend the situation with some honesty and hope. I was shocked by how quickly this story and girl sucked me in as the tears by the second chapter would attest. Music has a large role in this book but it's never clunky or awkward. Mia's somewhat of a cello prodigy and her boyfriend, Adam fronts a band called the Shooting Stars (Lauren might like that). Her father is a former punk and her mother was one of those feminist rock chicks, both parents still retain their rockin' sensabilities. When reading the acknowledgements I wasn't surprised to see that Forman had been listening to Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova's 'Falling Slowly' (from the movie Once) while writing this novel, you could feel the song's influence throughout each page. I think that could be the best comparison for this novel, it is to the written word as Falling Slowly is to your ears - emotive, heartwarming, stirring, powerful and memorable. This novel is about love. Love for your family and the family you make for yourself. The strength to follow your passion, to love your parents unconditionally and they for you, to have belief in people, to embrace music and life. It is also about choice, when no two options are easy, what would you do?

She feels lonely\u2026 But she is not alone. This story is told through Mia\u2019s emotional perspective, so we not only learn of her situation firsthand, but we are able to feel every piece of its heartache. This author does a phenomenal job bringing these scenes to life\u2014so entirely that I caught myself cringing at times while shaking off an intense visual, or wholeheartedly delighting in one. The writing is fluid and unique; simple yet profound , with little pinches of humor. Although the plot is intense, there is nothing over-the-top or unbelievable in its content. The setting weaves seamlessly through past and present, gradually introducing us to the pieces of Mia\u2019s life leading up to her accident. The romance in this story is just as gentle, and equally captivating. The fact that the storytelling was applied with some reserve complemented the book\u2019s darker tone. The strong family bonds and vast addition of music were interesting elements that I very much enjoyed. Beliefs on an \"afterlife\" aren't shoved down readers\u2019 throats. There are actually none. Instead, we are presented with uncertainty, and pockets of hope. But one thing is clear: This story builds the theory that we are in control of ours lives \u2026 and, quite possibly, even our deaths. Although I was hoping for just a little bit more where certain (spoilery) issues are concerned, this was still a very enjoyable, expertly-written, addictive read!

REALLY feel it when Mia begins to watch from outside herself, as her life, her world, is completely destroyed. My dad smiles and taps on his pipe. He started smoking one recently as part of this whole 1950s Father Knows Best retro kick he is on. He also wears bow ties. I am never quite clear on whether all this is sartorial or sardonic---Dad's way of announcing that he used to be a punker but is now a middle-school English teacher, or if becoming a teacher has actually turned my dad into this genuine throwback. But I like the smell of the pipe tobacco. It is sweet and smoky, and reminds me of winters and woodstoves. And just as Mia is never certain about which her father is being---sartorial or sardonic---I'm never certain on which Forman is being either. It's been so long that I can't remember what my first impression of this book was, but when I started reading this time, I was worried . . . worried that this older-and-wiser me was going to hate the\u00a0book that I previously loved, b/c several times Mia and her parents come across as nothing more than pretentious hipsters, who are too damn cool for everyone, but as I continued reading, more and more insights about Mia's perspective and preoccupation with her own (lack of)\u00a0coolness were revealed, and instead of being irritating, in this one, singular situation it made sense. Mia's parents really are that cool. It's not pretense. It's not affectation. Her mother has moxie, her father is geektastic with a formerly punk twist, b/c he played drums for a punk band, not b/c he listened to it on the radio. Her seven year old brother has \"verve,\" and says things like: \"I'm gonna be eight in December. Then I'm a man and you'll have to call me 'Ted,'\" Teddy reported. And Mia . . . well, Mia plays cello. Not that there's anything wrong with playing the cello . . . but comparatively . . . it could give a teenager issues. Especially when her father makes jokes about Mia being switched at birth, b/c she doesn't even look like the rest of her blonde-haired, blue-eyed family. AND b/c Teddy was born at a birthing center where a mix up was impossible---neither intended to be in any way hurtful to Mia, but come on . . . you remember what it was like . . . scrutinizing off-hand comments, psychoanalyzing conversations . . . If I was the brunette counterpart of my Arian family, and my parents refused to let my kid brother be born in a hospital, I could definitely see myself wondering . . . if they were wondering . . . The point is despite the inherent coolness of Mia's family, it's a real family, and Mia's recounting of them is full of bittersweetly\u00a0recognizable truths. And in this story . . . one of those truths is that Mia has to decide if she will stay. That decision is a painful process. I'm not going to lie, I sobbed audibly while reading this book. But Mia's story is as beautiful as it is heartbreaking, as hopeful as it is bleak, and I would not give up getting to know Mia and her family for anything. This is one of the books that will stick with you for years. So please . . . do yourself a favor and read it before going to see the movie when it\u00a0comes out on Friday.

Usually, you bond with the characters and read about the happy times before the bottom drops out and you have to make a dash for the Kleenex. That wasn't the case with this book at all. A fatal accident claims the lives of most of Mia's family members right off the bat. As she lies in an ICU bed, she has an \"out of body\" experience while stuck in a sort of limbo between this world and the afterlife. The story is told from Mia's perspective through flashbacks and observations of her loved ones as they gather in the hospital, hoping she'll wake up. All the while, Mia struggles to decide whether she wants to return to her remaining loved ones and a life forever marred by the unjust loss of her family, or if she wants to let her life fade away. Needless to say, this story had me turned into a snotty, sniffling mess in no time! Yet, I was also intrigued and captivated. I had some masochistic need to keep reading until I had finished the entire book in a single sitting. This is a thought-provoking, life-changing type of story that makes you ponder your own life and what you would want in a similar situation. You will be compelled to evaluate your own life, your priorities and your mortality. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to do some soul-searching.

Helping the reader better understand Mia\u2019s struggle between life and death. Though the novel is clearly small in its mere 208 pages, it doesn\u2019t seem inadequate in any way possible. Forman\u2019s writing is gripping, demanding that the pages are turned. The story is exceptional. Despite the solemn tone, I didn\u2019t find myself shedding any tears until the last three pages of the novel. Not that I didn\u2019t feel my emotions stirring throughout the entire novel, especially a scene including Mia and her grandfather, but I think my emotions bubbled until the last moment when they finally spilled over the edge. A powerful novel, intense, and moving. You can\u2019t help but find yourself taking note of the people and things that make your life worth living, after this experience. ...more A powerfully emotional novel, If I Stay is a journey through life and death, in the eyes of a young girl who has lost just about everything.

After a disastrous car accident, Mia finds herself looking down at her own battered body, barely alive. This is one case where, immediately, you get a feel of who these people are, their realness, the love they have for each other. With only a few minutes of getting to know them before the accident, I already felt a connection with Mia and her whole family, turning an already emotional novel into a gutting one. Mia's loss and grief is tangible through Gayle's effortless writing style. It's a tragic tale of unimaginable life changing loss that will make you thankful for everything and everyone you have in life. This novel is not a story, there is not even a plot per se; in short, it is a chronicle of Mia's life. While she's lost in this sort of limbo, we relive her life with her. She sends us through the ups and downs of her past years. Her relationship, fun family anecdotes, talents, dreams, everything she has ever had, and everyone she can still lose. Mostly, you can see how fast a life full of potential can be changed so drastically. You know that even if she does get through this, nothing will ever be the same. She will not be the same person that we're being introduced to. Through her stories and her time at the hospital, we also get to know other people in her life who love her so fully that you feel their pain for Mia's uncertain future. What got me the most emotional was not Mia's reminiscing, but the reactions to others towards her. There's an especially powerful scene with her grandfather that\u2026 ugh *clutches chest*. It shows exactly how talented Gayle is; to be able to render so much sympathy for characters you have only just met, in a book with a mere 200 pages at that, that is some outstanding writing. This is not just Mia's story, it includes everyone that has touched her life as well. Brilliantly written with as much love as there is sorrow, with as much life as there is death, If I Stay shows us the importance of family and friends that, together, make up our lives. A must read that I would recommend for all fans of YA contemporary novels such as Lauren Oliver's Before I Fall. Audiobook note: I wasn't the biggest fan of the music between certain chapters, but the narrator was truly amazing. Her voice authenticated all the emotions coming off of Mia wonderfully. A+! Cover Blurb Note: \"It will appeal to fans of Twilight\" O_O This book is not even close to being anything like Twilight in any way!

It was certainly a quick read and I enjoyed myself, but I wasn't blown away by it as many of my friends were. This novel tells the story of seventeen year old Mia Hall who is severely injured in a car accident that kills her parents and younger brother. While her body is comatose, Mia's spirit watches her friends and family rally in support of her while recalling poignant moments in her life as she decides whether or not to live or die. The stron If I Stay by Gayle Foreman was a mixed bag for me. It was certainly a quick read and I enjoyed myself, but I wasn't blown away by it as many of my friends were. This novel tells the story of seventeen year old Mia Hall who is severely injured in a car accident that kills her parents and younger brother. While her body is comatose, Mia's spirit watches her friends and family rally in support of her while recalling poignant moments in her life as she decides whether or not to live or die. The strongest aspect of If I Stay were the secondary characters, especially Mia's boyfriend, Adam, and her best friend, Kim. Both were likable and felt very real. I could identify with their pain and fears of potentially losing a loved one, and I loved their personality quirks. Even the minor characters such as Mia's parents' friends and Kim's mother were well written. Although we didn't learn as much about them as some of the other characters, the parts we did learn about felt real. What didn't work for me in this novel was Mia, and to a smaller extent her immediate family. I did not relate to Mia at all and I found her mostly unlikable. Part of this was because her character was inconsistently written. There was a disconnect between what we're told about Mia and what we're actually shown. For example, Mia constantly brags about how humble she is. Someone who is truly humble doesn't brag about it. Additionally, I didn't think her actions showed her to be a modest or humble person. Mia was also a bit too perfect, and I found that her idol status among those who loved her just didn't ring true. I found it odd that Mia's parents and brother recently died, yet none of the family reacts to it. It is all about Mia. Although the focus should have been on her since they were at the hospital visiting her, I felt that there should have been more acknowledgement of the three members of the family who didn't make it. Also, in the flashbacks Mia seems to be at the center of everything in a way that screamed Mary Sue to me. I also felt that Mia's immediate family was a little underdeveloped. While her mother comes across as sort of a bitch (though never to Mia), her father is flawless. Her younger brother seems to be a character whose only purpose is to be cute and worship Mia. They did not come across as well rounded characters. Additionally, like so many other novels, both adult and YA, the younger brother did not sound like his age. His dialogue was much too mature as were a lot of his thoughts. Overall, I enjoyed the novel, but not being able to relate to Mia kept this from being a truly great read for me. I enjoyed the sequel, Where She Went , a lot more than this one. ...more I absolutely loved this book.
