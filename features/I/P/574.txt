I'll try to be as kind and heartfelt as possible. This book is insultingly bad. Normally a bad book is just that, but this book is actually infuriatingly bad. Firstly, it's a fantasy book set in feudal Japan. That's fine. I would think that it being set in Japan, Hearn would have learned anything about the place, but she apparently did not. This book is written as if Hearn simply googled Japan and then decided to write a book on it. I'll go down the list of failings. Religion Japan wasn't Christian. It persecuted Christianity in the same way that Rome did; it's teachings undermined the ruling order. But in Hearn's world everyone is predominantly Christian, or at least they worship a god an awful lot like the Christian god; like looking down on suicide, which was a part of the way of life in Japan. So, okay, Hearn didn't do that justice; base a book of a land and F up their religion, okay. But this is the least of her offenses. Language Other novels written about or in Japan (<---B>Shogun, to name one</---B>) have tried to successfully capture the way people spoke; saying one thing and meaning another. Hearn tries to do this... I think. It's hard to tell because it is so blunt but she implies that they are saying something else. I guess. Either way the dialogue is awful. There is a two-page dialogue about a characters past that is painfully bad. It isn't emotional,<---M> even the character seems to know this</---M>, and it isn't realistic. The conversations are flat and would fail if they were imitating normal conversation, in that they should be trying for feudal speech they fail astoundingly. Terrain/Geography/History This is pretty hard to F up but Hearn does it anyway. She apparently read somewhere that Japan gets a lot of earthquakes, so the characters experience them, constantly . This would be informative of the climate and area, but it isn't - it's irritating. All it does is randomly distract from the story. The characters are talking about something and then the author stops to make everything shake, then everyone has to acknowledge the quake, then we resume. Maybe that's real, but it's also retarded. Include the quakes in exposition, don't stop the story to put them in. Realism only goes so far in books. If we had to read every time a character took a piss it wouldn't be interesting either. Now there is the infamous battle of Yae gahara from her book... which is clearly just a ripoff of the real battle of Sekigahara. The infuriating thing is that she uses the feuds, anger, and tension that came from the battle of Sekigahara but apparently didn't want to learn anything about it. Yeah, spending an afternoon researching battles and actual lords would have been so tough. It's insulting to every reader that she would be so lazy as to simply slap a 'Yae' in front of gahara and imitate such an important battle. How about a Japanese person writes a story about America and they talk about the bombing of Mearl Harbor? Or the Bivil War? Gimme a break. If you don't put the time into the work you don't deserve to have the job. Nuff said. Culture I'll just sum up the undulating wave of crap that she wrote under this category as culture. Hearn mentions the tea ceremony and Sesshu to add some sense of where the crap we are, but fails in both. The tea ceremony is highly regarded and ceremonial. It is obvious to anyone that knows anything about it that Hearn has no clue about it. So she simply puts a few ideas in and then assumes job well done. Or not. She does the same with Sesshu, a feudal artist. She drops him in and then completely inaccurately describes his artwork. Secondly, the characters act in no way as they would befitting their setting. Evidently Hearn has no clue about the hierarchy in Japan or how much different it was there than most anywhere else. Peasants were dirt to samurai. Samurai were the dogs of their lords, or daimyo. Or not. Hearn has everyone acting as if they grew up during the 1960's in America and freedom of speech is going strong. People constantly belittle lords, sons of lords, and people of higher rank. Speaking of samurai - THEY ARE CALLED SAMURAI! Why is it Hearn refuses to use the proper names for half of the things she is writing about? She will use fief to describe a lords power despite the fact that the average reader has no idea what a fief is, yet she won't use words like samurai, ninja, ninpo, ninja-to, and ninjitsu even though it's what THE BOOK IS ABOUT. It's as if Hearn was struck by some bizarre fear of using the actual words for anything. Normally this would just irk me, but it is to the point where misunderstanding is common. For example: The wooden training sword is called a boken not a pole. Those are completely different things. Hearn's lack of ability to describe anything leaves the reader with only the words she gives them, so when she says 'two people fight with poles' that is what we see. If she actually meant everyone fights with poles then... ugh, she really would have no clue what she is talking about. Historical Fiction This is not. It is hardly set in Japan. It is set in a place where they use the names of people from Japan. That is about it. The rest of this is the same fantasy garbage that proliferates the genre. And really, if you are going to base a fantasy world off of Japan then it should be pretty similar to it, otherwise why do it? You just like everyone looking Asian? So, aside from the fact that Hearn fails terribly at representing the people she set out to, how's the rest of the book? The characters are weak with unoriginal histories that are not spiced up in the least bit. The love is 'at first sight' which is the trademark of lazy writing. Why bother having to develop feelings when you can just say it was at first sight? Gimme a break. The hero, despite being written in 1st person, is remarkably flat. The beginning has him discovering his destroyed village and yet he seems pretty unperturbed by it. Later he feels something. Sort of. So, crappy characters. What else? Oh, everyone knows things that would be impossible for them to know just to move the story along and build superficial tension. For example: How the hell does a monk living in a temple in the forest know that the main character has acute hearing? Another: How is it everyone and their mom knows the main character is part of some assassin tribe by looking at him? Was his dad Elvis Presley and he looks just like him? I'm pretty sure assassins thing is to be unseen , but I guess that wouldn't make things tense, right Hearn? The prose is weak and most of the story takes place in exposition. They traveled here, they did this, and we are witness to very few of the actual happenings. What results is nothing that anyone really cares about. The only thing that bothers me more about having actually read this book is that anyone thought it was well-written, and worse, that it was awarded with anything. This is an insult to literature and I have very little hope left if this is what most people find 'good'. ...more _Across the nightingale floor_ So i decided to share my personal story with this book..

I stopped, stared at it and immediatly thought of the book that i have read years ago. I remembered how much i enjoyed it and i felt the urge to reread it. So i bought the whole series and the prequel and the sequel. And i am so glad i did. While reading it i had moments like being in a dream, a very distant and familiar dream of mine. The more i read the more i remembered and the more i remembered the more i was enjoying and loving it. This is a fantasy book set in medieval, feudal \"Japan\"(it is not Japan, but it definetely feels like it). The atmosphere is amazing, the writing is amazing (<---A>Lian Hearn</---A> uses both 1st and 3rd person narrative), great discriptions of the lands and great delineation of the characters.

Judging by other goodreads reviews it seemed to bug some readers quite a bit. One time I watched Darren Aronsky's The Fountain with an ex (a Spaniard) and he snottily asked me if I knew that none of the historical Spanish scenes really happened (I'll remember this when I've forgotten his name). C'mon, alternate history isn't new! I'm sorry, I can't focus on Star Wars because Yoda looks familiar. Where have I seen him before (this is going to bug me)? So, warning in fortune cookie book, I can handle it. If you don't overlap then you are living alone. Originality is valuable for the extra mile we can't walk alone. There's a bug infestation. Let me get that... Oops. I think I just changed history when I squashed that bug. It turns out that Tom Cruise was not the very last samurai after all. What harm could that have done? I'm sure it's all right. This is a fantasy novel from 2002. If it came out a little later it would have been published as a young adult novel (market trends and all that). There could be warnings about the odds of young adult fantasy novels being about a young hero who magically has all of the powers he's going to need inside of him? More annoyingly (to me), he also has all of the self righteous fuel he's going to need. One dead mama, coming up. Hey, I met these hot guys and they just gave me all my ideologies. Neat! I don't care if that '80s ya book ripped off the one child policy from China, if George Lucas liked Japanese films. Everything else with WWII. You can make a better dish out of the same recipe your grandma always used. But the odds are so very high it will taste much the same and I've had this meal before. I'm a little tired of it. I spit out honor. Where's the personal touch? The you that doesn't remind me of someone else (honor tastes like chicken). The other person in the same memory. What would you do today if you spent today alone? Set your story in any place you like. Please let me recognize your character from someone else. Across the Nightingale Floor is good when young Takeo interacts with people he meets, be it villagers or the lords he fears or respects, as if he's feeling out how to behave. Unfortunately, the first person leaves a lot of time for rhetoric as well as doing. The relationships he doesn't know how to already play as if he were Good Will Hunting in front of a chalk board staring down a hard math problem are good. Just live, don't think about the end game of power, please. Then the honor! Groans. People are kinda the same and different. Why can't worlds and lands be the same way? Kinda different and kinda the same. It's when you can't work with what you've got that I have a problem. Like if it is already finished (duh, the easy magic!). How about something alternative? Step on another bug (sorry, bugs. I swear that I try not to kill bugs). Change the course again. You can do it if you're writing your own story. Kaede, the female lead and different perspective was pretty good. Maybe doesn't step far enough out of kinda the same stories of female quasi leads in hero quest fantasies (you know, I'm a woman. I have to get married, I love that guy, I want to marry for love). She has potential to offer a life that's not handed on borrowed fine china because it's not magical egotism. At least she wanted someone to trust and the end result wasn't defeating something. There are two more books in the series. I'm probably not going to read them. Not unless I am hungry and don't know what else to read. The odds are better that I'll find something I couldn't have found on my own in someone else's day. P.s. Hearn should have kept her real name. Rubenstein! How about taking Lafcadio (where the Hearn comes from)? Lafcadio Rubenstein! Pen names are mightier than swords. That's not my fault. I became lame when I changed history. ...more 1 1/2 In my review for Graceling I stated that I was a bit of a sucker for romance elements in action type stories.

(See 'Fire Study'.) So it's a bit ironic that, for this book, I think the romance element between the two protagonists was the weakest aspect of the book. It was so eye-rollingly, groan-inducingly bad that I think the story would've been well-served if it was cut entirely. Or, if not cut, then handled better. Much better. Much, much, much better. (view spoiler) [I mean, it's worse than Romeo and Juliet, and, if you think about it, that's pretty bad. Their eyes meet, they're instantly deeply and desperately in love, to the point where they'd rather kill themselves than be without each other. (hide spoiler) ] Yes, it really is that bad. Conversely, the romance aspect between two secondary characters was more touching, more realistic, and should've been developed a bit more. But, anyway, even before we got to the eye-rolls of the romance - and I mean this literally. I did actually roll my eyes several times - there were other issues. For one, I didn't really dig the narration. It felt simplistic and unengaging. There was a lot of \"I was filled with grief, and I felt tears rolling down my face\" type stuff - in other words, a lot of telling very little showing. Also, when the narration switches from the first-person perspective of the Takeo chapters to the third-person-limited of the Kaede chapters, there's not enough change of tone or style. You can tell it's the same writer writing both, and just substituting \"I did\"s for \"she did\"s. I would've appreciated a greater change in tone or texture, but, you know, any change would've been nice. Furthermore, I was really disappointed in the lack of cultural flavor. I know that this isn't a historical fantasy in the sense that it's set in a set time/place/culture, but it's clearly mimicking Japanese culture, but in such a half-assed way that half the time you feel like you could be reading a story set any where and when, and then when an element of Japanese culture is introduced it's often more jarring than anything. Especially because some of the elements didn't ring true. Granted, I'm not exactly an authority on Japanese culture, but some of it just didn't sit well - such as the slap-dash Tea Ceremony and the way that the bowing lacked hierarchy and protocol. (This was perhaps doubly jarring having read this shortly after Eon which, despite it's flaws, captures Asian culture more thoroughly, and weaves it throughout the story, instead of throwing random tidbits out, and Goodman seems to have done a good deal of research on hierarchial protocol, which Hearn seems to have glossed over entirely.) (Oh, yeah - and don't forget the random earthquakes, 'cause Japan has a lot of earthquakes, so we need to have a few randomly scattered throughout the story, even though they don't really serve a purpose or add to the storyline in any way...) But, that all said, it's not all bad. There are elements of the story which are good. I enjoyed watching Takeo grow as a character, his relationship with Shigeru, and developing his abilities that come from \"the Tribe\" (i.e. magical ninjas, because, as we all know, the ability to be a ninja is something which is passed on in the blood... Honestly, I prefer assassin type stories where it's a matter of training and honing ability, and less \"you can go invisible 'cause you have magic blood\", but, whatever.) And while certain things that happened didn't have near the emotional impact that they ought to have, and would have, I suspect, were the writing better, I still liked many of the elements of the story - the intrigue and double-talk (though, like Eon, the intrigue in this book suffers because you generally know which side everyone is on and there's never that guessing of \"whose side is he really on?\" and \"what's her angle?\" that a good book with well-written intrigue has). Um - where was I? Good things, right? I got side-tracked. Um - yeah... So.. It was a slow build, but the last quarter was pretty fast-paced, and if it weren't for the vomit-fest of the romance, it could've been a solid 3. (With the writing being what it was, I don't think it could've ever really managed more than that, though.) I mean, seriously. I wish I could convey just how terrible it was without being spoilery, but I can't, so allow me to rant behind tags: (view spoiler) [The whole \"I just killed a man who tried to rape me\" and \"You just killed the man I came to kill, and my revenge is thwarted\" and the \"But we're alive and safe and we love each other (even though we've talked for, roughly, a whole 5 minutes), so let's have a 15 minute quickie while people are still fighting and the fucking castle is being burned down - and the effing corpse of the man you just killed is, like, right there!\" and this after the Shigeru and Lady Whatsherface story is just poorly handled and buried... I mean... it was just awful, really. (hide spoiler) ] ...more I really enjoyed this one, and I regret avoiding it in bookstores for so long.

Their relationship isn't believable at all, and if it was a bigger part of the book I doubt I'd have rated it as highly as I did. It is interesting though to see their relationship as a parallel to Shigeru and Maruyama's. - I liked the writing, particularly the flow and how nice it was to read. The switch from third to first person with each chapter/perspective can be a bit jarring, but it surprisingly worked for me. - I wanted so much more from Kaede... At the beginning, I felt bad for her but it's sad to think that other than her killing Iida at the end all I associate with her is falling in love with Takeo and the whole feeling faint/ill a lot thing. I really hope Kaede gets more development in the next books. - I didn't care much for Maruyama either but I appreciated her influence. I did like Shizuka and Yuki though. - The last 50 pages or so seemed to happen so suddenly. I was beginning to wonder how things were going to spread over the series, and honestly I wasn't expecting Iida to be defeated so quickly. *Shrugs* Bring on the aftermath. - I really liked the platonic relationships: Shigeru and Takeo, Kaede and Shizuka, etc. I wanted more from them but still, I liked them. - Basically yay assassins and history and stuff!

She's gone to great lengths to instill Japanese culture into every part of this book, from the names of people and places to social and political customs, even clothing and holidays. For all intents and purposes, this is a story about feudal Japan. Except it isn't. The Tales of the Otori takes place in a kind of alternate-universe Japan, a place where everything is the same except where it isn't. Once you get past that, the book becomes a lot of fun to read. And if you don't know much about the history and culture of Japan, that all shouldn't be a problem. It's the story of a boy from an isolated town, one of the Hidden - a small religious sect that faces political and religious ostracism (see Christians in the Edo Period) from an isolationist and power-hungry warlord (see Tokugawa Ieyasu). Young Tomasu is the only survivor of a raid by that warlord - his family, his friend and his people were burned to the ground and he only lived thanks to the appearance of the Lord of the Otori, Shigeru. Wracked with guilt over the death of his brother, Shigeru took Tomasu in as his son, renaming him Takeo. The boy found himself in a new land, with a new home... but that wasn't quite all. He soon discovered that he had a secret birthright, passed down through his father. Takeo was a member of The Tribe, a mysterious clan of spies and assassins who possessed near-mystical powers. They could move silently across nearly any floor, they could become invisible, or appear to be in two places at once. They were masters of the shadow and deliverers of death. See Ninja . It's a neat story, and the beginning of a series of books which are the author's first major foray into adult-ish fiction. It probably qualifies as Young Adult fiction, so if you're into that (as I know some of you are), it'll be a good read.

But it's all a setup, for they plan to murder him while he is there as well as several of his old supporters, including an old female flame. The boy, of course, is the one hope in saving not only his savior, but, also Kaede, who becomes his love interest by the end of the tale.

I'm really conflicted about what to grade this book. I enjoyed it, but it was really depressing. When I closed the book all I felt was the futility of these people trying to make their own decisions. Someone is always there to take away their choice in one way or another. Takeo, who is the main character, was an interesting person to follow.

When I closed the book all I felt was the futility of these people trying to make their own decisions. Someone is always there to take away their choice in one way or another. Takeo, who is the main character, was an interesting person to follow. He seems strong in the sense that he is able to adapt to any new situation and still retain the core of who he is. But, he also seems weak because he lets himself be taken by these different groups who don't really value him. They just seem to value the services he can provide. It's hard to blame him for that weakness though, because it seems like there's no way to escape these groups who want him. I'm very torn over my attitude toward him. It was hard at first to get into this book. I have a difficult time being immersed in a storyline when I constantly feel that I'm being told the story. It was like Takeo was an old man at the time and was reciting his coming of age story. Entertaining, yes, but also very distancing. I really liked the fact that there were so many side characters. Even if they didn't play a big part it was nice to see them as part of the atmosphere. A lot of books have a bad habit of making their characters seem like they live in a vacuum. I'm pleased that wasn't the case here. I felt so bad for the women in this world. They seemed to never win. They were hostages and pawns and controlled at all turns. Even women with control over their property were in a very precarious position. It was a little disheartening. Even though I did feel distanced from the story it succeeded in making me root for characters. When that situation with Kenji pops up toward the end I was absurdly angry on Takeo's behalf. If I could have reached through the book and stabbed him in the eye I would have. I was also rooting for Takeo and Kaede. I wish there was a simple solution for them. I guess that's why the book was so depressing. I got attached to the main characters and couldn't help but feel for their plights. Whether that was sympathy, concern, or anger depended on which point I was at in the story. Overall I enjoyed it, so I guess I'll have to give it four stars. Thanks for the rec new_user! ...more I call Twilight on this one. Man, you can waste so many cool things just by adding magic into the story. It removes any sense of struggle, any effort on the part of the characters. Also, destiny is a dark and sometimes tragic thing , losing control over your own life - not just a way to get everything from life without having to earn it! The characters are flat, the language simplistic, the description basic and lackluster, the cultural coloring nothing beyond popculture crap, the plot contrived, t I call Twilight on this one.

The characters are flat, the language simplistic, the description basic and lackluster, the cultural coloring nothing beyond popculture crap, the plot contrived, the ending rushed, the motivations...I could go on and on. It basically reads like a bad RPG session of The Legend of the Five Rings. The first half: an incredibly long buildup with no sense of direction. Would be cool: the teenage protagonist, having witnessed the slaughtering of his entire village, goes mute. A psychologically powerful concept which makes Takeo interesting... if it weren't for the stupid-ass explanation later in the story: that it was just his magical ninja powers kicking in... The moment when it gets almost interesting: when all the characters finally meet. Unfortunately, there is no outcome, no conflict, no resolution whatsoever. The second half: virtually just 'ticking boxes'. They go from A to B, killing X and Y, and so on, and so forth. Would be cool: the romance between two secondary characters. They are mature, they are in danger, they both have duties to fulfill, they plan ambitiously to get out of the trouble... Unfortunately , both die offscreen for stupid reasons, like any Star Trek redshirts. The ending: just awful. Gave me nightmares. Stay away from this book. It will give you brain damage. ...more The worst issue of this book is a promise of great historical fiction setting, that turns out to be a fantasy one, loosely inspired by the Japanese culture.

I think his reading made me sympathize with Takeo more than I would have if I had read the book in print format. But the female reader was terrible \u2014 she speaks slowly and too distinctly, as if she's reading to kindergartners. This was extremely annoying! Fortunately, most of the book is written with Takeo's narration, so her reading didn't ruin it for me. Also, I think, as an American reader, I might have benefited from actually seeing the oriental names, rather than only hearing them. It took me a while to distinguish between some of the names because they were all unfamiliar to me and ... (sorry) they all sounded too similar at first.

These powers allow him to go invisible and create an illusionary double of himself . . . but only for short periods. He also has an uncanny hearing ability where he can walk into a house and exactly determine how many people are within. The girl, Kaede, is the political prisoner of another SHOGUN style family where she must suffer insults and pray that prosperity is returned to her family, who were on the losing side of a war. The boy's SHOGUN style savior/father figure is also from a losing side and he is playing a dangerous game: there are some within and outside of his family who want to see him dead. A more powerful SHOGUN style lord has invited him to come to his domain and marry Kaede. But it's all a setup, for they plan to murder him while he is there as well as several of his old supporters, including an old female flame. The boy, of course, is the one hope in saving not only his savior, but, also Kaede, who becomes his love interest by the end of the tale. Look for simple elegance in the writing style, straight forward SHOGUN style politics (though not nearly as complicated as SHOGUN), bloody combat and lots of water symbolism. ...more When I finished Lian Hearn's Tales of the Otori series (of which this is the first), I felt as though I'd been eating Hershey's chocolate when I expected Valrhona (or at least Lindt).

These much-heralded books are set in a fantasy version of medieval Japan, and on the face of it, the story is promising: Takeo is the lone survivor of the massacre of his village by an evil overlord. He is rescued by the mysterious Lord Otori Shigeru, who adopts Takeo and brings him into his plans to overthrow the lord who destroyed Takeo's village, and Takeo discovers that he has supernatural talents which tie him to a guild of assassins and spies. The elements of the plot are fairly standard -- orphaned hero, mysterious rescuer, hidden talents, love at first sight (with the heroine, Shirakawa Kaede), an evil overlord to conquer, prophecies which must be fulfilled -- but Hearn weaves them together in a way that could well be interesting to read. The problem is that her storytelling is distant and flat, which gave me little emotional connection to the characters and thus less interest in the outcome of the story. Hearn seems to be striving for an elegant, spare style like that of a Japanese screen or garden, but what she misses are the details: colors, flavors, tactile sensations. Fight scenes are over in a few sentences; journeys are pared down to a couple of paragraphs. The second and third books improved in this respect, but they remained curiously unengaging, perhaps partly because Hearn missed her opportunity to hook me in the first book. I thought the story was interesting, I liked many of the characters, I really wanted to like the books more, but I couldn't cross the distance created by the style to become really absorbed in them. ...more Very fast read, in part because it was so utterly gripping (I nearly missed my bus stop because of it, then accidentally whapped the guy sitting across the way from me with my cello case in my hurry to get out.)

Everything is beautifully detailed, and for this Legend of the Five Rings fan, it was an excellent addition to the mystical samurai sub-genre. My only quibbles were with the shifting narrative, which is fine if you keep it all from the same kind of viewpoint (e.g. consistently third-person as in Martin's Game of Thrones series) but switching back and forth from 1st to 3rd as done in this book was just distracting. Also the relationship w Makoto at the end seemed to come out of nowhere, though I'll admit that sometimes relationships just do. Otherwise, I quite look forward to reading the rest of the series, though I'm in no tearing rush to find them. Also, I'm quite a fan of some of the author's non-pseudonymous work. Now having read some of the negative reviews on the site, I'm a little appalled by how people are freaking out about how Ms Hearn isn't properly 'dignifying' Japanese culture (and usually, so far as I can tell, these people aren't all that familiar with the culture to begin with.) The book, like a lot of manga, doesn't pretend to be realistic, so the high level of dudgeon directed towards it on that account is certainly unwarranted. ...more Right from the beginning, this book will grab you. The characters and setting are so exotic and enticing...you will first want to be there, and then, as you read, start to feel that you are. I was so caught up in the fantastic descriptions and places that I wasn't even thinking as much about the plot! There were a couple of twists and turns that left me gasping in disbelief.

That this is set outside the US and the UK, a huge plus. So what went wrong? Early on I assumed Across the Nightingale Floor had been translated due to inconsistent, simple and superficial language. And I wasn't alone in my thinking. However, a quick search revealed the author to have been born and raised a few miles from where I live in England . Very little emotion is shown by Takeo, our hero, despite what should've been some harrowing scenes in the beginning in which he lost his entire family in the massacre of his village, witnessed by him. Balancing 'show' and 'tell' is a common problem and unfortunately there's far too much 'tell' than there really should be. Long conversations, flimsy explanations and detailed summaries are shortcuts used here contributing to a severe lack of depth concerning Takeo's character and a level of unreadability to his chapters as I was unable to connect or sympathise with him . On the other hand, Kaede, our heroine, manages to engender sympathy for her plight right away. Her chapters were noticeably different in quality, contained more action and the feminist-themed commentary was intriguing. \"Even beauty is dangerous for a woman. Better not to be desired by men.\" Again and again this is proved in this patriarchal, feudal Japan. Including superstitious nonsense regarding the powers of women cursing men just by being arbitrarily associated with them. If a man happens to die at the hands of the woman he tried to rape it's the would-be rapist's fault, not the woman's. That's the social norm of the time period this is set it. Kaede's insta-love at first sight towards Takeo and its reciprocation turned me off for it's commonality and overuse amongst young adult novels but THT suggested it could be taken as \"fated to be mated\" . I think, in the end, it was a mixture of both. Their relationship was engineered to be Shigeru and Maruyama's history repeating itself, an ill-fated one where being together would mean death. Our hope this second time around is that they'll finally be reunited and gain a happy-ever-after. For me, this isn't something I like, this repetition in the vain hope all will work out in spite of history attesting to that fact it most likely will not. I can see the poetic beauty and note the tragic Shakespearean nature of these circumstances, though I can't appreciate them here, not with this writing. And certainly not when it looks like the other books will draw out the angst-ridden will-they-or-won't-they. No, thank you. Hearn gives away her ending early on via heavy foreshadowing. Predictablity isn't something I'm a fan of , although I am grateful the author didn't go full Romeo and Juliet on her characters, close call though it was. I'm also glad the issue of sex wasn't glossed over or ignored. Sex was heard, had with prostitutes, and had next to a rapidly cooling corpse in what must've been a blood-spattered room and clothing. Sexy. Usually I'm an ardent lover of politics and dastardly machinations, I wasn't in this case. I had zero invested in the plot and no side ever revealed itself to be a favorable one to champion . Takeo, Shigeru, Iida, Kenji and the Tribe. I hoped for nothing. No, I tell a lie. I hoped they'd all die quickly so I could finish the damn book and move on. As super secrets assassins go I wasn't terribly impressed with the Tribe . Like everyone else they had an agenda, not one I could get behind, and possessed no members I could warm to. They were petty and patronising with no respect for free will, what's to like about that? Their skills were only mildly paranormal, mostly standard stuff to use to fight, escape and evade: enhanced strength and hearing, fast reflexes, creating temporary shadow doppelgangers to distract, and hypnotic gazes that can send you to sleep. Out of all the assassin scenes Takeo's acts of mercy were the ones to make a good impression on me and a bad one on Kenji, Takeo's teacher: \"It's that softness he has,\" Kenji said. \"It drives him to act from compassion, even when he kills.\" Villain, Iida, is defeated unbelievably fast and easy . You could argue a stroke of luck, a fortuitous accident, if you will. Not in my eyes. Iida lost his credibility as a convincing foe in the moment he was beaten. For someone so completely paranoid and obsessed about security he underestimated his opponents and ignored possible threats, not just the one that brought him down either. I understand what the author was trying to achieve with Across the Nightingale Floor and no doubt it would make for a beautiful, graceful yet tragic movie. As a book, it failed to seduce me. Reading shouldn't be hard work. Just skimming I struggled to stop my eyes from glazing over in utter boredom until the last 20% when the pace picks up. I couldn't, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone. *Read-along with The Holy Terror and Cillian . ...more Across the Nightingale Floor by Lian Hearn had been sitting on my to read shelf for a little over a year.

The world is familiar and yet at the same time distant, the characters are beautifully rendered with palpable emotion and the tale is intriguing. In fact many of my favorite elements in any story were present. In many ways this truly imaginative piece, set in a forged world serves to underline why I love fantasy novels to such a great extent: because through their enigmatic, familiar yet separate worlds they reveal truths about our own world while still escaping the bounds of normality. The tale focuses on two separate points of view: that of Kaede and that of Takeo. Kaede's point of view is narrated in third person while Takeo's was revealed in first person allowing for two interesting perspectives. Takeo becomes a master assassin, learning to control his mysterious powers, while separately Kaede struggles with an unwanted approaching marriage and with a reputation for killing all the men she's engaged with in any way. This is an active and well paced novel, clearly written with passion. I believe that when authors write their best the passion and enthusiasm should be visible within their words despite any flaws and it is clear here that Lian Hearn was engaged in building her world. A world which it was a wonder to enter and explore. However that said there were some elements of the plot which fell a little flat. At times the explanation lacked a little. I would personally have enjoyed it more if Hearn took more time to explain the nature of Takeo's mysterious powers rather than simply stating he could appear invisible or create a fake image of himself. Also the romance between Takeo and Kaede seemed underdeveloped and unrealistic. Which was a pity considering that the two separate characters had been framed with care and dedication. Still this was an incredibly easy read, lacking in deep philosophical or psychological meditations perhaps but still truly exploring the real reason for novels existing: to tell stories. And the story contained within Across the Nightingale Floor is one of wonder, intrigue and excitement. I will definitely continue on to explore the next book in this series and I hope to find it as compelling as the first. For Lian Hearn has written a novel that captures why authors write, to tell the story in their soul through another person's eyes. A story that engages and amazed this reader. I fully recommend this. ...more Quick thoughts: -stilted dialogue and flat characters dominate the book -the pseudo-Japanese aspects feel more like lazy research and lack of care especially when... -the narrative misuses the importance and meaning of the tea service, the bowing/social hierarchy that shaped Japan, etc. -the insertion of Christianity into even a faux-version Japan is not awesome or accurate -awkward tense shifts from third to first for different narrators -the narrators each sound exactly the same -ridiculous case of Quick thoughts: -stilted dialogue and flat characters dominate the book -the pseudo-Japanese aspects feel more like lazy research and lack of care especially when... -the narrative misuses the importance and meaning of the tea service, the bowing/social hierarchy that shaped Japan, etc. -the insertion of Christianity into even a faux-version Japan is not awesome or accurate -awkward tense shifts from third to first for different narrators -the narrators each sound exactly the same -ridiculous case of \"eyes meet and love blooms passionately\" instalove This book had promise but squandered nearly all of it.

So first up is Across the Nightingale Floor. Across the Nightingale Floor more than lives up to its billing as an exceptional new literary sensation, from the tragic excitement and drama of a sacked village on the opening page, to the later multi-layered court intrigues and tales of family revenge by ancient Japanese dynasties. The engaging story and appealing characters combine incredibly well to produce a highly readable book that should appeal to many different-aged readers. Takeo is just 16 when he loses his family to the evil Lord Iida and it seems like incredible luck when he is saved from death by the noble Shigeru, rightful heir to the Clan of the Otori. As Takeo travels into new territory and towards a new, unknown life, the tribal rivalries, romances and histories at large in this new world are revealed to him. These are treacherous times. Everyone is at risk, and few can be trusted. Takeo also has a special gift--inherited skills that mark him out as different from other men. He is at once desirable and highly dangerous to those in power. His life is soon in danger. It's a fascinating landscape and a riveting story; it's genuinely very difficult to put down once you've started it. Unusually for a children's book with so many characters, several with strange-sounding names, the story is easy to follow. The writing is exceptional, with very few words out of place. The author, a pseudonym for Australian writer Gillian Rubinstein, is generous enough to paint the characters and scenery in great detail, yet keeps the writing clipped enough for the plot to move along at a steady pace. Importantly, there are no slow bits. The book does not flinch from adult content and is certainly a mature read.

Oh, I forgot to mention, Across the Nightingale Floor is the first book in the Tales of the Otori trilogy. When I started reading it, I thought pah, this is just some wannabe trying too hard to make this seem Japanese-y. I mean, when I came across the name Tomasu, which basically equates to Thomas, only in katakana-ed forn (katakana is a writing system in Japanese used for foreign/loan words) I let out a big scoff of disbelief. But as I continued, I was thoroughly engrossed in the world she created. A sort of alternate feudal Japan based on and incorporating real places that can be found there. The writing was a bit sparse in some places, and the dialogue felt a bit unnatural at times, but overall it was pretty good. I especially loved the metaphors and descriptions that used lots of Japanese symbolism. The only real issue I had was that some times the author would tend to use those adverbs a bit too much. The book is written in the first pov, but when you switch over to the other main female character, Kaede, her chapters are written in third. I didn't really care for Takeo at first, and enjoyed reading Kaede's sections more, but as the book went on I empathized with both. The plot was fantastic, after you reach the halfway point it just races forward in a suspenseful rush for the finish. There were quite a few surprises at the end that left me in shock and going \"I so didn't expect that.\" Her world building was fantastic and I now totally want to read more stories like this. You even get to read a snippet of the first chapter for the next book! If you want to test out the waters of Asian fantasy, or want a quick read, this is definitely the book for you. And, if you aren't that big of a fantasy nut, this book would be perfect for you too, since the main components that make up fantasy (ie: magic, swords and sorcery, and all the other stuff) aren't that prevalent in this book. I am so going to read the rest of the books in this series now! ...more", "Title": "Across the Nightingale Floor"},
