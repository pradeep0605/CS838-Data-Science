[Update] I came across a cool and relevant quote in The Tell-Tale Brain by V. S. Ramachandran from Darwin's The Descent of Man : \"...false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for everyone takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path toward errors is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened.\" ...more I think everyone heard my jaw drop.

And then recently I wrote a piece on my blog about criminal systems in Europe and America. It was a personal project which led me through months of research and reflection. I titled it, \"To punish is to promote: How criminal justice systems can encourage crime\" and came to the conclusion that in some instances punishment may actually have the opposite effect intended. In other words, I realized the limits of power. So then to read Gladwell's David & Goliath was more than just an experience I could understand but completely relate with. It was so empowering to know I wasn't alone, that there were many more remote misses fighting to be just as good as everyone else in school and ending up with skills no class can teach. If you haven't read David & Goliath you won't really understand what I'm speaking about. But I'd encourage everyone to read it. It will make you realize that there's no such thing as simple, black and white. There's grey. There's yellow, blue, pink, orange, you name it. It will allow you to understand that for every difficult hardships life will throw at you you'll learn skills everyone else will wish they had.

(Spoiler: (view spoiler) [They cater to the jury and the prevailing standards of judgement, which may become old too soon. (hide spoiler) ] ) +++ Let us illustrate this by taking an example from this very book. This reviewer has to warn the reader that the example is originally invoked in the book for another purpose though it has been adopted more or less verbatim here, but we need to get into that now. (By the way, the careful reader should also be able to divine why this small essay is can also serve as a review for this book in particular and to all of Mr. Gladwell\u2019s books in general.) Let us go back to 19th century France. Art was a big deal in the cultural life of France back then. Painting was regulated by the government and was considered a profession in the same way that medicine or the law is a profession today. The Professionals who did well would win awards and prestigious fellowships. And at the pinnacle of the profession was The Salon , the most important art exhibition in all of Europe. +++ Every year each of the painters of France submitted two or three of his finest canvases to a jury of experts, bringing their work to the Palais de l\u2019Industrie , an exhibition hall built for the Paris World Fair between the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Seine . Throughout the next few weeks, the jury would vote on each painting in turn. Those deemed unacceptable would be stamped with the red letter \u201cR\u201d for rejected. Those accepted would be hung on the walls of the Palais , and over the course of six weeks beginning in early May, as many as a million people would throng the exhibition. The best paintings were given medals. The winners were celebrated and saw the value of their paintings soar - became \u2018bestsellers\u2019. The losers limped home and went back to work. \u201c There are in Paris scarcely fifteen art-lovers capable of liking a painting without Salon approval ,\u201d Renoir once said. \u201c There are 80,000 who won\u2019t buy so much as a nose from a painter who is not hung at the Salon. \u201d The Salon was the most important art show in the world. In short, for a painter in nineteenth-century France, the Salon was everything - the Booker Committee and the Bestseller List rolled into one. +++ And now, the twist: In spite of the all the benefits, the acceptance by the Salon also came with a large cost: for the truly creative and path breaking (let us take for example the Impressionists such as Monet, which is the case study taken up by the book): 1. It required creating the kind of art that they did not find meaningful, 2. & They risked being lost in the clutter of other artists\u2019 work. Was it worth it? The Salon was the place where reputations were made. And what made it special was how selective it was. There were roughly three thousand painters of \u201cnational reputation\u201d in France in the 1860s, and each submitted two or three of his best works to the Salon, which meant the jury was picking from a small mountain of canvases. Rejection was the norm. Getting in was a feat. \u201c The Salon is the real field of battle ,\u201d Manet said. \u201c It\u2019s there that one must take one\u2019s measure. \u201d\u00a0 It was the place where \u201c you could succeed in making a noise, in defying and attracting criticism, coming face-to-face with the big public. \u201d But the very things that made the Salon so attractive\u2014how selective and prestigious it was\u2014also made it problematic. No painter could submit more than three works. The crowds were often overwhelming. The Salon was the Big Pond. But it was very hard to be anything at the Salon but a Little Fish. +++ Night after night, the rebels (the Impressionists) argued over whether they should keep knocking on the Salon door or strike out on their own and stage a show just for themselves. Did they want to be a Little Fish in the Big Pond of the Salon or a Big Fish in a Little Pond of their own choosing? The problem for the rebels such as the Impressionists was The Salon\u2019s attitude: it was cautious, traditional. It had a reputation to uphold for being the voice of approval. It could not afford to make mistakes. \u201cWorks were expected to be microscopically accurate, properly \u2018finished\u2019 and formally framed, with proper perspective and all the familiar artistic conventions, \u201d the art historian Sue Roe writes. \u201c Light denoted high drama, darkness suggested gravitas. In narrative painting, the scene should not only be \u2018accurate,\u2019 but should also set a morally acceptable tone. An afternoon at the Salon was like a night at the Paris Op\u00e9ra: audiences expected to be uplifted and entertained. For the most part, they knew what they liked, and expected to see what they knew. \u201d The kinds of paintings that won medals , Roe says, were huge, meticulously painted canvases showing scenes from French history or mythology, with horses and armies or beautiful women, with titles like Soldier\u2019s Departure, Young Woman Weeping over a Letter, and Abandoned Innocence. The Impressionists, on the other hand, had an entirely different idea about what constituted art. They painted everyday life. Their brushstrokes were visible. Their figures were indistinct. To the Salon jury and the crowds thronging the Palais , their work looked amateurish, even shocking, and was repeatedly turned down. They had no hope of making waves in the Big Pond of The Salon. +++ The Big Fish\u2013Little Pond Gambit Pissarro and Monet were smarter. They conjured up an alternative to the shackles of the Salon. They thought it made more sense to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond. If they were off by themselves and held their own show, they said, they wouldn\u2019t be bound by the restrictive rules of the Salon, where the medals were won by paintings of soldiers and weeping women. They could paint whatever they wanted. And they wouldn\u2019t get lost in the crowd, because there wouldn\u2019t be a crowd. In 1873, Pissarro and Monet proposed that the Impressionists set up a collective called the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs . There would be no competition, no juries, and no medals. Every artist would be treated as an equal. The Impressionists\u2019 exhibition opened on April 15, 1874, and lasted one month. The entrance fee was one franc. There were 165 works of art on display, including three C\u00e9zannes, ten paintings by Degas, nine Monets, five Pissarros, six Renoirs, and five by Alfred Sisley \u2014a tiny fraction of what was on the walls of the Salon across town. In their show, the Impressionists could exhibit as many canvases as they wished and hang them in a way that allowed people to actually see them. This was the first exhibition of \"Impressionism\". It was here that Critic Louis Leroy took the title of a work by Monet, 'Impression, Sunrise' to deride exposure and then went on to qualify these artists, quite skeptically, as \"Impressionists.\" The name stuck. +++ This historic show brought the artists some critical attention. Not all of that attention was positive: one joke (in addition to the name 'impressionism' itself!) told was that what the Impressionists were doing was loading a pistol with paint and firing at the canvas. But that was the second part of the Big Fish\u2013Little Pond bargain. The Big Fish\u2013Little Pond option might be scorned by some on the outside, but Small Ponds are welcoming places for those on the inside. They have all of the support that comes from community and friendship\u2014and they are places where innovation and individuality are not frowned upon. \u201c We are beginning to make ourselves a niche ,\u201d a hopeful Pissarro wrote to a friend. \u201c We have succeeded as intruders in setting up our little banner in the midst of the crowd. \u201d Their challenge was \u201cto advance without worrying about opinion.\u201d He was right. Off by themselves, the Impressionists found a new identity. They felt a new creative freedom, and before long, the outside world began to sit up and take notice. In the history of modern art, there has never been a more important or more famous exhibition. If you tried to buy the paintings in that warren of top-floor rooms today, it would cost you more than a billion dollars. +++ In the end, the Impressionists were lucky to make the right choice, which is one of the reasons that their paintings hang in every major art museum in the world. But this same dilemma comes up again and again, and often the choice made is not as wise. Their story should remind today\u2019s top artists and authors that there is a point at which money and mainstream recognition stop making them and start breaking them. The story of the Impressionists suggests that when the artists/authors strive for the best and attach great importance to getting into the Bestseller lists and Booker Lists, rarely do they stop and consider\u2014as the Impressionists did\u2014whether this is always in their best interest: 1. One of the important lessons the Impressionists could teach the modern artists is that there are times and places where it is better to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond than a Little Fish in a Big Pond, where the apparent disadvantage of being an outsider in a marginal world turns out not to be a disadvantage at all. 2. Another important lesson is that what counts in the end is if you let the Big Pond define you, or if you were brave enough to invent an alternative. The answer might not always be a Little Pond, but it sure can\u2019t be meek acceptance of the current status quo path either. Think of all the great artists of the modern age who could hardly be defined as mainstream during their own lifetimes, who would never dream of writing for the approval of a committee, who were as far away from honors and awards and money as only exiles could be. Think of all the books with prestigious honors and the #1 bestseller mark that seem like jokes now. Think about how so many of our best authors seem to end up producing the same sort of exceptional trash - very well written, but hardly the real deal that would last a century. +++ What then can be an alternative for the ones who want to break free? We can talk about one option that our case study suggests - it might not be the only option, and the creative ones can always come up with better option, but the exhortation of this reviewer is a simple one: that the really ambitions artists and authors need to start thinking hard about the best use of their own abilities and efforts. (Added here from the comments section, for clarity): To restate, in our day the artists have three options - 1. Satisfy the Bank 2. Satisfy the critics (or impress) 3. Or satisfy their own genius (or impress) The last being the most risky and perhaps most important one. So what is the winning option again? For one thing, examples abound of niche novelists\u2019 groups pushing the boundaries of literature, slowly attaining cult status and eventually becoming part of the canon itself. Just as Pissarro, Monet, Renoir, and C\u00e9zanne weighed prestige against visibility, selectivity against freedom, and decided the costs of the Big Pond were too great, it is time for the really serious to make the same call, of rejecting the conventional trappings of \u2018success\u2019 that only serves to limit their possibilities.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more No-one does insight porn quite as well as <---A>Malcolm Gladwell</---A>.

Even though much of the backlash often falls directly into the same traps of which he gets accused (e.g. critics cherry-picking the parts of his books that best support their complaints), the key argument is generally quite valid: Gladwell takes a minority, slightly counter-intuitive, perspective, highlights some evidence that possibly supports it, and ignores alternative readings of the same stories, and all the evidence for different positions. The key question is: how much does this matter? One of the central concepts in this book is that of the inverted U-curve \u2014 where an increase in something is valuable for a while, but then starts to become a negative (e.g. drinking some alcohol is good for your health, but drinking too much causes problems.) Gladwell applies this to numerous other areas, from teacher\u2013student ratios, or the relationship between wealth and parenting, through to punishment for crimes. But one question not asked in this book, or any review I've seen of it so far, is whether Gladwell's own brand of pop-science might have exactly the same curve, and whether he might actually now be at the wrong end of it. This book contains two extended discussions on topics I know quite a lot about (the conflict in Northern Ireland, and the interpretation of the Biblical story of David and Goliath). In each there's an existing dominant narrative that is largely flawed. But directly attacking a dominant narrative generally has little effect (indeed, often simply reinforces it). A more effective approach to countering a position with which you disagree, and one that Gladwell is a master of, is to simply tell a better story with a different narrative. (There has been significant research on this area in recent years, particularly with respect to political debate, but there's also a long history of this in theology too, in the battles between heresy and orthodoxy.) On the left-hand side of the inverted U-curve, this is a very valuable function. Handled well this approach stimulates thinking and debate and, hopefully, leads to a deeper and more nuanced general understanding of the area. But this relies on arriving at a synthesis of both positions. The key problem with Gladwell, it seems to me, is that he's simply too good at what he does. He's such a superb story-teller that people read his books and come away convinced of his positions, accepting his narrative as being the complete truth itself, rather than simply as a valuable contribution to a wider debate and understanding. But I'm unconvinced that this is a flaw with his books and columns themselves. They're doing a very precise thing, and doing it very well. And this one is no exception. It's a delight to read, and raises a lot of very interesting and valuable questions. And those who wish to challenge the answers it offers would do well to learn from the approach, and start telling better stories themselves. ...more This guy writes so well.

And I love that he leads me down the garden path. I wonder how many people will be caught in the depths of their prejudices only to find the tables being turned. It would be hard to make a more compelling argument, for instance, in favour of the Californian \u2018three strikes and your in\u2019 laws than he makes here or to find a way to so convincingly refute this emotional, logical and compelling argument almost immediately after. This book was infinitely confronting for me. If I was paranoid then I would have to assume Gladwell had gone out of his way to find every topic I find almost unbearable to think about \u2013 that somehow he had written this book as part of a bizarre vendetta against me. I\u2019ve explained my problems with dyslexia before - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... - so want go through that again other than to say that I found this part of the book really hard going. I wouldn\u2019t wish dyslexia on my worst enemy \u2013 shame and humiliation are not toys to be played with. As you can also see in that review, I\u2019m from Belfast and left just before the Troubles started. That Gladwell discusses the internment here was and is and will always be like an open wound for me \u2013 my childhood consisted of hearing stories of rubber bullets fired into crowds of protestors and spent singing songs about armoured cars and tanks and guns that came to take away our sons, of collective punishments meted out by unfeeling monsters and of whole populations being guilty because they were Irish. Parts of this book held a mirror up to all of the things that made me feel different and odd and out of place in my childhood, all of the things that held me apart, and those things never really leave you, even if you haven\u2019t thought about them for years. And if you want to make me full of an unquenchable fury, then talk of collaborators with the Nazis turning in Jews so they can to be transported to the death camps. Or of people refusing to buy clothes because a black person may have touched them. Or of black children being arrested and \u2018checked for venereal disease\u2019 as a means of humiliating them for asking for justice, for having to ask for what ought to have been theirs\u2019 by birth right. And the worst of my nightmares are here too. I am a father of two daughters. This book was written to torture people like me. Torture us by showing our nightmares made real, lived out in the lives of people we would empathise with, but Gladwell forces from us more than merely our empathy, he places us in their shoes \u2013 he has us holding the hands of our own daughters as they lay dying or has us wait months to learn of their slow death by torture. I let very few writers take me to those places. This book has opened and scattered salt across virtually every wound and every scar, real and imagined, of which my life is constituted. All the same, read it. This isn\u2019t a pleasant read by any stretch of the imagination, this isn\u2019t something which is fun \u2013 but you\u2019ll remember this book and it will make you think and it will make you feel \u2013 and there\u2019s not much else to ask from books. ...more Now, there is a lot of skepticism about Gladwell and his research methods, but whether he self-selects his data or whatever, I think that the very nature of his writing indicates that his research isn't totally conclusive.

He has a knack for telling stories and presenting dry information, like statistics, in a compelling way. Plus, his theories are always provoking, if not convincing. I like to read Gladwell as more of a short story collector rather than reading his books as though they prove a single theory about humanity and how we live. Taking his chapters in isolation, he uses the form of the case study to advance some interesting ideas and I don't always agree with him. So if we think of David and Goliath as a collection of case studies that loosely revolve around a particular theme (power, the myth of advantage, and the underdog-something Gladwell is particularly obsessed by), several chapter are capable of provoking conversation such as his chapter on class sizes. Using a high school that can have classes as small as 12 kids, Gladwell talks about the \"too much of a good thing\" danger and succeeds in making us realize that small class sizes are not the golden solution to America's education problem and are not necessarily a good thing...but then he totally disrupts that train of thought when he validly mentions that a drop in class sizes across the board resulted in no appreciable gain because teachers weren't adapting their teaching methods. It seems to me that in his work there is always this give and take. He gives you an idea and some evidence to back it up...and then throws in some parallel story that either invalidates the first point or is completely irrelevant. For instance, he takes the founder of the Three Strikes Law and talks about the tragic circumstances that led to the law's genesis. He then talks about the problems of the law, weaves in some stuff about legitimate power and how cracking down harder on criminals is nonsense using Northern Ireland's history and a specific neighborhood in New York. At this point, I'm totally with it. But then he throws in a story that's meant to parallel Reynold's story-a family in Canada whose daughter is kidnapped and then years later found dead and subsequent investigations lead to the murderer being apprehended- and then talks about how this Canadian family chooses not to use their daughter's case to bring about change of the legal system..and attributes this to their Mennonite background. The overall effect is that it leaves the reader kind of confused and adds nothing to this underdog defeating the giant theme. These kinds of problems occur throughout the entire book and the ending leads one to wonder...what exactly was the point of all that, Gladwell? Added to the fact that much of this book seems to deal with stuff that's way too similar to the ground he covered with Outliers , I'd only recommend this book to teachers looking for excerpts to use to provoke criticality about bias and research or using excerpts to introduce an idea about power, justice, etc. ...more Malcolm Gladwell is one of those authors who you remember reading, but may not quite recall which book a particular phrase came from.

The reason is students had more peers. There was more interaction, dialogue, and energy among the students. A class size of 36 was too large to be good. Two brilliant and talented students got into top colleges: a science major at Brown and a math major at Harvard. After two years they were so disheartened and disappointed that they switched to less rigorous majors. The reason is they were surrounded by so many bright minds, they felt average or below average in those fields. If they had gone to second tier schools, they would have been at the top of their classes and probably not changed majors. Dr. Jay Freireich lacked empathy for his patients - children with leukemia.

But they were cured by Dr. Freireich\u2019s procedures of repeated cocktails of painful drugs and large needles taking frequent and painful bone marrow samples. It is suggested that his lack of empathy was caused by lack of parental nurturing and love when he was a child. Dyslexics developed abilities that brought them great success.

This time his theory is that being the underdog and having disadvantages can actually be an advantage . The title comes from a biblical story about a giant warrior named Goliath who was slain by David, a shepherd boy who was good with a slingshot. Gladwell analyzes the story and determines that the boy was not, in fact, an underdog, but was actually was a skilled hunter, and that Goliath didn't stand a chance against him. My favorite discussions in the book were about education, including the popular-but-apparently-not-true belief that small class sizes are always better. There were also some good stories about choosing colleges, and students reading this may be surprised to learn that a high-ranking school (such as the Ivy League) may not always be the best option for your career. There was also a good discussion about dyslexia, and why having challenges to overcome could actually help motivate you to be more successful. I finished this book a few days ago, and it is already fading fast from my mind, something that always happens to me with Gladwell books. I find his writing pleasant and his ideas interesting, but the details don't always stick. Recommended for those who want to feel like they've learned something, but you don't want to think too hard. ...more I'm a Spock sort of person. I believe that everything in the universe is logical.

Unlike Spock though I embrace a wider spectrum of what constitutes logic, eg emotions are very important and relevant....but otherwise I agree completely with his approach to life. This book is all about situations that don't look logical on the surface, but if you dig a little deeper you discover the logic. To that extent it reminds me slightly of Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything - a book I enjoyed enormously. It looks under the surface of things to discover what is really going on. Situations where the underdog does well are explored...some of these include: *David and Goliath. (It turns out David was not the underdog he at first appeared to be...) *The surprising emotional or intellectual strengths that can result from a childhood where loss or scarcity have been experienced.... eg poverty, the loss of a parent, or the experience of dyslexia. Obviously a constructive outcome does not apply to everyone who has undergone these obstacles in life, but it does apply to a surprising number of people. *The importance of equality to levels of happiness. Sometimes very poor countries have a higher rating of happiness than richer countries, where there is greater disparity between people. It is not correct to automatically assume that the people in poorer countries are automatically more unhappy. *Small class sizes in schools are over-rated, sometimes bigger classes are better. (Though there is a cap on size too. Massive classes aren't helpful either.) *Unless you are an absolute genius, it is better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond. This applies startlingly to universities. Go to Harvard at your peril. *The experiences of Martin Luther King and his supporters in Birmingham. *The shortcomings of the Three Strikes legal system in California, initiated by Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was murdered in 1992, versus a philosophy of forgiveness, as shown by a Mennonite called Wilma Derksen, whose daughter was also murdered. *The Troubles in Ireland, and how a march by a group of Catholic women managed to undermine the force of the British army. *The extraordinary courage of the people of Le Chambon in France, who sheltered Jewish people in World War 2, and how they managed to get away with it, despite the Germans being aware of what was going on. I found the book interesting, but a little 'bitty' (lots of short pieces about different things.) Some of the situations described interested me more than others, but this is probably only natural. I'm also not convinced of a philosophy of the strength of the underdog. Yes, sometimes it happens, and often it is great when it does, but there are millions of occasions where the winner takes all. There were some fascinating nuggets of information though, and all in all it was an enjoyable read. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Malcolm Gladwell's TED lecture on why David beat Goliath http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_glad...

Gladwell writes interesting anecdotes and then generalizes them, showing common themes, behaviors, or morals. Whether or not these generalizations are valid, his books are vastly entertaining, and this book is no exception. David and Goliath is perhaps the most entertaining book I read this year! In the introduction, Gladwell reviews the biblical story of David and Goliath. The popular conception is that Goliath was a mighty warrior, and David a meek shepherd who was clearly the underdog. Gladwell turns the story around, and by analyzing the biblical verses, he shows that David was not an underdog at all. He had a number of advantages that should have raised his odds of winning. This is the major theme of the book; many apparent disadvantages can turn out to be advantages, while many apparent advantages can turn out to be disadvantageous. Each chapter is a compendium of anecdotes from all spheres of life, that give evidence for this turnabout. Gladwell describes a father who volunteered to be a basketball coach for his daughter's team. Neither the father nor the girls had any experience with basketball. But because he was desperate, the father came up with an atypical strategy that turned the team into a powerhouse. Gladwell shows that although dyslexia is a learning disability, it can help mold a person. A person with dyslexia, given the right aptitudes, can overcome the handicap and excel where other people have lesser abilities. At a meeting of prominent university donors--mostly successful businesspeople, a neuroscientist asked how many had been diagnosed with a learning disorder. Half the hands went up. A medical doctor who had a terrible, traumatic childhood developed a cure for childhood leukemia. Other doctors with normal childhoods were too squeamish to experiment and find such a cure. Gladwell shows that ultra-small class sizes are not always advantageous. Selective, elite schools are not necessarily good for all the students--they might only be good for those students at the very top of the class. He wrote that \"...if you want to see the positive effects of elite schools on self-concept, you are measuring the wrong person. You should be measuring the parents.\" The chapter about elite schools follows up with a very interesting observation, that it is better to be a big fish in a \"small pond\" than a little fish in a \"big pond\". As evidence for this, Gladwell cites statistics about college students completing a STEM degree (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). He writes that \"the likelihood of a student completing a STEM degree rises by 2 percentage points for every 10-point decrease in the university's average SAT score.\" If you are in a university where many people seem to be smarter than you, it is more likely that you will drop out of a challenging curriculum. Gladwell writes about the apprehension in London before the expected bombing blitz by the Nazis. Courage is not something that you already have that makes you brave when the tough times start. Courage is what you earn when you've been through the tough times and you discover they aren't so tough after all. He shows how the Germans thought that the bombing would traumatize the city. Instead, it made the British more courageous than ever before. I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology, as a fast, entertaining look at human behavior. ...more I've never hidden my stigmatized identity as an academic social scientist who loves Malcolm Gladwell.

These points are valid, but I don't see them as damning. Gladwell isn't a scientist, and he's not writing textbooks. Ideally, he helps spark people's interest in research and makes them want to know more (and maybe less eager to de-fund science?). I enjoy getting swept up in Gladwell's story-telling and I like the way he weaves together a little research with a lot of engaging humanities / human-interest-type stuff. I don't always buy his arguments, and there's plenty to nit-pick, but I admire and enjoy his rhetorical style. His stories are juicy and memorable. David & Goliath is similar to Gladwell's previous trilogy of social science-y books. The theme here is situations where underdogs prevail and giants fail to benefit from their seemingly obvious advantages. As usual, the theme is diffuse and some of the stories are more germane, persuasive, or compelling than others. Still, I enjoyed taking the somewhat meandering, but also thought-provoking journey. ...more I wrote about my Malcolm Gladwell ambivalence in my What the Dog Saw review. Reading Gladwell has become, for me, the literary equivalent of eating Cheetos or listening to Coldplay - I unequivocally enjoy the experience, but in a vaguely unsatisfying way and I wouldn't want anyone to catch me doing it. His rhetorical stock-in-trade is the reassessment of received wisdom about human behavior examined with respect to such organizing topics as trends, decision-making, success and, in this instance, I wrote about my Malcolm Gladwell ambivalence in my What the Dog Saw review. Reading Gladwell has become, for me, the literary equivalent of eating Cheetos or listening to Coldplay - I unequivocally enjoy the experience, but in a vaguely unsatisfying way and I wouldn't want anyone to catch me doing it. His rhetorical stock-in-trade is the reassessment of received wisdom about human behavior examined with respect to such organizing topics as trends, decision-making, success and, in this instance, perceived relative advantage in apparently mismatched conflicts. David and Goliath 's argument gets off to a rather clumsy start with a creakily literal-minded 'historical' analysis of the titular metaphor. Gladwell is right about the ubiquity and deadliness of slingers in ancient warfare, but his assertion that Goliath is the warrior 'outgunned' by his opponent (\"'Goliath had as much chance against David,' the historian Robert Dohrenwend writes, 'as any Bronze Age warrior with a sword would have had against an [opponent] armed with a .45 automatic.'\") doesn't seem so much a radical reassessment of the mythic conflict as a pedestrian reassertion of its traditional significance. And the claim that the 'historical' Goliath suffered, like Guiness's tallest-man-ever Robert Wadlow, from acromegaly, strikes me as the sort of disturbingly naive literalism I would expect from a televangelist and not a staff science writer for the New Yorker. Does he suppose that the giant in the Jack tales suffered from the malady, as well? But, I quibble. The concepts of relative deprivation and desirable difficulty were convincing if not entirely new, and the analysis of iconic civil rights photographs, particularly the image of teenage Walter Gadsden being 'attacked' by a police dog, was revelatory. Gladwell has a clean, unobtrusive style and a facility for translating arid scientific literature into engaging layman's prose. Can I offer you a Cheeto? ...more Malcolm Gladwell is notorious in certain circles for his brand of \"turns out\" pseudo-science writing.

Otherwise, I'd probably skip it. Gladwell's books have always walked the line between thought-provoking and entertaining on one hand, and over-simplistic and strained on the other hand. This one fell on the wrong side of that line. The stories frequently managed to be entertaining and adequately told, but the link between the stories and the ideas they're supposed to illustrate are frequently far too flimsy to hold up under any kind of scrutiny. Portions of the book, particularly his direct deconstruction of the story of David and Goliath, are even painful to read. I'm not sorry that I read it, but I wouldn't recommend it highly to others. ...more *A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/10/22...

This book is not about underdogs and giants in any conventional sense of these terms. Rather, the book is about the curious nature of advantages and disadvantages, and how each can (under certain circumstances) become its opposite. The first lesson to be learned is that the things we take to be advantages are often no such thing. Our greatest mistake here comes from the fact that we identify a certain quality or characteristic as being a benefit or advantage, and then assume that the more of it there is the better\u2014when this is often not the case. Put another way, most of us recognize that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, and yet we fail to appreciate just how often and where this principle applies. For instance, we recognize that having a certain amount of money greatly facilitates raising children (it being very difficult to raise a family in a state of poverty), and yet we fail to recognize that beyond a certain point wealth also makes parenting increasingly difficult (for it becomes harder and harder to instill qualities of hard work and self-control). Or we recognize that small class sizes are a good thing, and yet we fail to recognize that classes can actually begin to suffer once they become too small (since diversity and energy begin to disappear). Another arena wherein an advantage can become a disadvantage is in power and authority. Power and authority is an advantage, of course; however, when it is wielded illegitimately and without fairness, it can actually cause more chaos, destruction and violence than it curbs. This is as true in the classroom as it is in community policing as it is in handling minority groups within a nation\u2019s borders. The second lesson to be learned here is that certain disadvantages can sometimes drive people into positions of advantage. Take the disadvantage of being born with a disability, for example. Say dyslexia. In our modern world, where the ability to read is extremely important\u2014and practically a requirement for success\u2014having great difficulty with reading is a major disadvantage. And indeed the statistics indicate that the vast majority of those who are born dyslexic end up falling through the cracks and missing out on success. Still, though, many dyslexics have gone on to become highly successful people; and it has also been noted that in certain fields (such as entrepreneurship) an inordinate proportion of the most successful individuals do, in fact, have dyslexia. So how can we explain these success stories? What we find in these cases is that these individuals have managed to compensate for their disability by developing skills that make up for their flaws (such as an improved memory or debating prowess). Thus, in a way, the successful dyslexic has actually benefited from his disability, because it has forced him into a position where he has had to develop other skills that have led him directly to success. Also at play here is the fact that dyslexics tend to endure many failures when they are young. Repeated failures (especially at a young age) have the potential to crush the spirit. But they can also have the opposite effect: they can inure the individual to failure, thus making them more likely to take risks and try things that others wouldn\u2019t\u2014which is often a sure path to success. A similar phenomenon also sometimes touches trauma victims. Take the ultimate trauma of losing a parent in childhood, for example. This is one of the worse experiences imaginable, and the trauma of losing a parent in childhood does indeed crush the vast majority of those who have the misfortune of enduring it. Again, though, it has been noted that a very high proportion of highly successful individuals across many fields (from science to art to politics) have in fact lost a parent in childhood. And what we find in these cases is that the experience has left these individuals with the mind-set that now that they have endured such a terrible event, that nothing could ever be so bad. And thus they are liberated from the fear of failure, and\u2014like the successful dyslexic\u2014are willing to try things and take risks that others are not (which often leads directly to success). The same experience and logic can also apply to underdog groups. For example, when a group recognizes that it is severely over-matched in terms of skill or strength compared to its opponent, it can begin to feel liberated to try unconventional tactics and approaches. This is often for the best, for it turns out that unconventional tactics and approaches are frequently very effective against giants\u2014in everything from sports, to politics to war\u2014and are, in many cases, the only chance the underdog has to win anyway. Again, then, in both of these instances (the trauma victim and the underdog group) a disadvantage has driven the party into a position of advantage, and thus the disadvantage may itself be seen as a kind of boon. Gladwell has done well to make us rethink the nature of advantages and disadvantages across many fields. The only major flaw in the book, in my view, is the third and final part. The theme of the part is that power becomes less effective (or even counter-productive) when it is wielded illegitimately. The problem with this argument is that it's a classic case of the straw-man: Gladwell has set up an opposition that is very easy to defeat, and then smashed it to pieces. What's worse is that the examples Gladwell uses to prove his point here are quite weak. Still, there is much of value in the first 2 parts of the book.

This is harmless enough when confined to the fiction aisles of your local library, but Gladwell presents his ideas as scientifically respectable, even moving (well) beyond the academic literature and into high-concept generalization. And this is what gets him in the hot seat. By now we're all familiar with Gladwell's tried and true formula: packaging a mixed bag of vignettes that loosely revolve around some common theme. His latest book, eponymous with the biblical tale implanted in every child's vocabulary, serves as the hub with which his assorted case studies can network. The humble stone-slinger slays the mighty warrior\u2013the archetypal underdog story. Except Gladwell upends this classic tale and contends that any ostensible disadvantages on the part of David were actually aptitudes, and vice versa for Goliath. After some offbeat meta-analysis of the Hebrew account, he intones the book's central theme: \u201c There is a set of advantages that have to do with material resources, and there is a set that have to do with the absence of material resources \u2013 and the reason underdogs win as often as they do is that the latter is sometimes every bit the equal of the former.\u201d (pp. 24-25) Now there's a heartwarming idea giftwrapped in persuasive prose. One of Time 's most influential people of 2005, Gladwell's ability to craft absorbing narrative merits the lavish acclaim from the popular press, but the accolades stop there. His cultivated habit of extrapolating grand truths from flimsy research has proved time and again his Achilles' heel. The anecdotes he recounts stand by themselves and gain nothing by being tangled in with pop-psychology, especially when there is actual peer-reviewed research into many of the areas Gladwell touches. Gladwell leans all of his weight on a small-sampled (read: underpowered ) study which found that less legible fonts activated higher performance in students, presumably because the students worked through the problems more slowly in order to decode the typeface. Yet, as psychology professor Christopher F. Chabris points out , Gladwell conveniently omits any reference to the replication studies (of superior statistical power) that failed to reproduce this result. That the study Gladwell makes such heavy weather of is plagued with sampling, selection effect and other confounds does not bode well for his thesis. Pesky details are of trifling importance to Gladwell, who steers the data in directions both cliched and maudlin. Were we to find life on the moons of Saturn, he would undoubtedly apply his guiding principles there as well; so sure is Gladwell that this obscure study holds the key to overcoming life\u2019s obstacles that he applies it to dyslexia, claiming that inbuilt disadvantages generate asymmetrical success stories. Replication results notwithstanding, are we to really believe that the authors of the typeface study suppose their findings reveal some deep lesson about turning adversity into triumph? Gladwell may be a lot of things but mantic isn\u2019t one of them. You could fill a supertanker with all of the sociological and psychological layers pushed to the periphery in favor of his handpicked fiction. The balance of his thesis rests on self-reported anecdote by real-life Davids who faced down their own Goliaths. There is nothing so prescient as hindsight, especially when other factors stab at the provocative narrative hanging in the balance. Complications be damned: it can only be adversity that produces successful outcomes which, curiously, seems to knock against his thesis in Outliers (2008), which replaces adversity with caprice and right-place right-timeness. How many rabbits will he pull out of the same hat before even his unsuspecting readership cry foul? And it gets worse for Gladwell. One need not inventory his entire catalog, as his scuffles with internal contradiction can be found in adjoining chapters of David and Goliath . After tagging dyslexia as a \"desirable difficulty\" that breeds success, he juxtaposes a story about a would-be scientist who dropped out of school because she encountered undesirable difficulties at a renowned university. By relying on Gladwell's vacuum-packed logic of the preceding chapters, one is left scratching his head as to why the \"small-fish-big-pond\" schematic wasn't parlayed into the successes afforded the world's dyslexics. For Gladwell, it seems, difficulty is a good thing until it isn't, which smells as fallacy-laden as the aphorism 'If you're not early you're late.' Or as Christopher Chabris puts it in his blue-chip review in the Wall Street Journal: \"The idea that difficulty is good when it helps you and bad when it doesn't is no great insight.\" Even his deconstruction of the David and Goliath bout diverges from the core theme he attempts to build throughout the book. Gladwell tells us plainly that David actually had the sizable advantage since lithe marksmen were always favored over cumbrous infantrymen clad in heavy armor. Within the conventional confines of ancient warfare, it was Goliath who was the decided underdog. Why then did this strategic imbalance, along with his hypothesized acromegaly condition, not spur Goliath to victory as it did the dyslexic CEOs or Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9\u2019s middle school basketball team, or steel his resolve as with the near-miss survivors during the Battle of Britain? For a more hyperbolic but just as on-target commentary, see Daniel Engber's review in Slate: \"The notion that a rule holds true except for when it doesn\u2019t runs through David and Goliath, and insulates its arguments from deep interrogation. Is it really advantageous to have severe dyslexia? Yes, and certainly not. Are children better off without their parents? Don\u2019t be silly, but it could be so. These non-answers rub the dazzle from Gladwell\u2019s clever thesis statements, until they all begin to look like dullish intuition. We don\u2019t need another book to tell us that adversity can lead to greatness (see: memoirs by CEOs, episodes of The Moth, every college essay ever written), just as we don\u2019t need another book to say that adversity really, really sucks (see: the world outside your window). But couched in the golden armor of anecdote, Gladwell\u2019s overgrown ideas seem powerful and new.\" What's perhaps most unforgivable about Gladwell's tactics is that he, whether wittingly or no, ignores the relevant research into the very topics he covers. For example, why not mention the ongoing research on the comparative value of attending elite vs. non-elite schools? Why not discuss the actual research on age-specific impairments of dyslexia? Or why not, even if only in one of his many footnotes, source the relevant literature for the science behind \"desirable difficulty\"? [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Probably because this complicates the narrative. But drawing on unrelated research that supports your thesis at a minimally conceptual level while ignoring the more relevant research extant is what we call cherry-picking. Subsequently presenting this research as though it models macroscale principles about the nature of reality is shifty behavior, to put it mildly. Closing Thoughts Even with the outpouring of negative reaction from various quarters of the blogosphere, Gladwell's literary talents remain as agile as ever. His ability to locate and draw out the most moving aspects of the human stories he collects is on full display here. But this savoriness is perpetually undermined by his messy forays into social science, in which he scavenges the academic literature for nuggets that can be spun into a thematic web. In David and Goliath , this web comes unraveled into muddled contradiction. The quickening stories he inflects through fluid prose work well on their own, even in their romanticized state, but Gladwell seems unable to fight the compulsion to reach for obscure, underpowered, unreplicated studies to which he can fasten his larger than life lessons. Despite this awkward matrimony often borne out in the pages of his books, I suspect most readers are none too interested in Gladwell's fidelity to scientific wisdom but rather are lulled by the melody around which all good storytelling harmonizes.

Naturally, one would think that David has no chance of winning the battle, but history says otherwise. Why? because apparently the boarder line between what we call advantages and disadvantages is not as clear as we think it is. The Israelites looked at the sturdy giant armored body of their enemy as the greatest advantage he could ever have, where in fact, it led to his demise. Interested to know how? Give the book a try. It is definitely a good read. The author mainly takes this example as a model upon which other social experiences and events can be based. The main idea: No matter how undesired a difficulty you are faced with, unknowingly, it could lead to your success. One example Gladewell tackles is dyslexia, which is the difficulty of reading and comprehending texts. Dyslexic kids are at a huge disadvantage: they cannot keep up with their class, and their future is - as society judges - is decided. Then how come, one kid who was cursed with such a thing, was able to climb the ladder of success and become one of the most notable lawyers is his entire country? It is precisely because of dyslexia. Now, is it really a curse? and knowing that, would we ever wish dyslexia, or any other undesired difficulty upon our children if we knew it could lead to their success (or couldn't)? <+++>David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants</+++> is a great book.

In his last book Outliers: The Story of Success, Gladwell introduced \"the 10,000hr rule\" as \"a key in success\". I thought it was an overly simplified conclusion, and I strongly disagreed with it. I felt the same way about this DAVID AND GOLIATH. It could be even harmful if you take his conclusions as the definite truth.

Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss? Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death? Can David beat Goliath? If you\u2019ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell\u2019s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David\u2019s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don\u2019t have rocks, use paper. As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot\u2014a Goldilocks point\u2014that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I\u2019m thinking of C, for an example, although she\u2019s still working.) Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell\u2019s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.) Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening\u2014listening very carefully. Boies didn\u2019t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened\u2014very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers\u2014or especially lawyers?\u2014too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn\u2019t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there\u2019s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn\u2019t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field. From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell\u2019s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do. ...more This is the kind of book I would normally dismiss immediately, but as a book club pick I gave it a shot.

Obviously the author is trying to make a point and I understood that all of the anecdotal comparisons should be leading me towards a conclusion of some kind. But either I'm too dense, or it's too obvious. Because I have no idea what this book is about. Story after story circles back making loose comparisons without much progression. Bibles and basketball to class size and Impressionism. And on my side, a nap while trying to give it a listen on a Saturday afternoon. After waking up... fish and ponds, and then dyslexia and so called \"desirable difficulties\". Whoa. Note that some of the stories are interesting in themselves, but I think that the connections Gladwell is trying to make to prove his point are tenuous at best. They could also just be coincidences. Yes some people are successful despite overcoming difficulties, but many are not. When he does make a point it seems almost a \"gotcha\" moment as you're wrapping up one story and he suddenly circles you back to something covered a chapter ago and tries to make a connection... Maybe these times were an AHA moment for some, but I continued to be unimpressed. Over halfway through was giving this a fair shake, I think, and turned my attentions to more interesting activities. But then I just had to finish. I knew if I really wanted to write this review it had to be with a full knowledge of what the book entailed. Apparently these books are popular because they translate the social sciences to the masses. And while I do think social sciences are interesting, results of these types of studies can be easily manipulated to make a point. The Wall Street Journal's review sums it up nicely, \"Malcolm Gladwell too often presents as proven laws what are just intriguing possibilities and musings about human behavior.\" The notion that a rule holds true except for when it doesn't runs through David and Goliath. You can't make 300 pages out of interesting possibilities and musings. At least not one I want to read. It seems to me that while there might be some bits to learn here, the whole thing is strung together with such tenuous threads it's hard to take any of it seriously. ...more My favorite book of the year.

And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we\u2019re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn\u2019t faze us. I\u2019ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.\u201d The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others.

It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. \"When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good.\" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble? Source: http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316 http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0... The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends. I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic. Even then, I strongly recommend this book for the pure pleasure of indulging yourself in Gladwell's storytelling, and for the ample food for thought he proposes. ...more<---C>Malcolm Gladwell</---C>", "Title": "David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants"},
