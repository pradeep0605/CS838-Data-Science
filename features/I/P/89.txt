Once upon a time there were three billy goats who lived near a bridge. Once upon a time there were three soldiers, tramping together down the roads after the war. Once upon a time there were three little pigs. Once upon a time there were three brothers. No, this is it. This is the variation I want. It was a better coming of age than Catcher in the Rye , but I also thought Twilight was a better coming-of-age than Catcher in the Rye (<---B>fuck you, Holden Caulfield</---B>). It wasn't a terrible book. I've read far worse. It's just that the writing style sometimes get on my nerves. The sentences are sometimes written fully, and oftentimes it just goes like this out of freaking nowhere. For no freaking. Reason at all. If that's the kind of thing that bothers you. Then you should probably avoid this book. This book has almost no plot. It is full of odd sentence structures and purple prose. The entire book is about a poor-little-rich-girl living with a poor-little-rich-family with the kind of ending that makes you go \"WHAT THE ACTUAL KIND OF M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FUCKERY IS THIS?!\" It's not terrible. But there's almost no plot at all. The \"Liars\" are more \"Talkers,\" and they have almost no relevant role in the book because this book is about a pretentious girl with nothing but #whitegirlproblems and #richpeopleproblems . The aforementioned \"Liars\" don't do anything in this book ,<---M> they're not witty</---M>, they're not cute, they don't give off the sense of closeness and kinship that you get from growing up with someone their entire life. Hell, they're nowhere near Dead Poets Society kind of interesting. This is a coming of age, and nothing more. It has the kind of writing style that's often choppy like this. Commas are sometimes used. And sometimes not. Haphazardly. With no punctuality. No pun intended. Sentences are fragmented. The main character sometimes. Has the tendency to use overwrought, run on metaphors. To describe herself. And her headaches. Such as a helicopter blown by the wind tossed by the torrential rain in the wilds of Alaska felt by a little Eskimo girl during the first whispers of a glacial spring with the scent of violets and hints of lavender in the fields of Grasse. The Summary : My full name is <---C>Cadence Sinclair</---C> Eastman. I am nearly eighteen. I used to be blond, but now my hair is black. I used to be strong, but now I am weak. I used to be pretty, but now I look sick. It is true I suffer migraines since my accident. It is true I do not suffer fools. Poor little Cadence Sinclair is wealthy. She is loved. She is one of the Sinclairs, a good-looking \"old-money Democrat\" family, think the Kennedys, without the political aspirations. They have names like Liberty, Taft, and Tipper. They go to Ivy League schools. They have trust funds. They have sired a generation of children, the leader of which is Cadence. Cadence and her crew call themselves \"The Liars.\" The Liars are composed of her cousins Mirren, Johnny, and the outcast \"Healthcliff,\" Indian love interest, Gat. The Liars supposedly cause trouble. They don't really. They do almost nothing. Cadence herself is sick. She is prone to theatrics, and she is not-so-secretly in love with Gat. She gets headaches. She feels self-pity. She is privileged. She doesn't realize it. This is the story of a wealthy, beautiful family. It\u2019s a beautiful night, and we are indeed a beautiful family. I do not know what changed. This is the story about a girl's headaches. Why did I go into the water alone at night? Where were my clothes? Did I really have a head injury from the swim, or did something else happen? This is a story about The Liars. And their spectacularly brilliant conversations for the entire fucking summer. They have baby oil spread on their bodies. Two bottles of it lie on the grass. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid you\u2019ll get burned?\u201d I ask. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in sunblock anymore,\u201d says Johnny. \u201cHe\u2019s decided the scientists are corrupt and the whole sunblock industry is a moneymaking fraud,\u201d says Mirren. \u201cHave you ever seen sun poisoning?\u201d I ask. \u201cThe skin literally bubbles.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a dumb idea,\u201d says Mirren. \u201cWe\u2019re just bored out of our minds, that\u2019s all.\u201d They're not the only ones bored out of their mind. The Writing : I plunge down, down to rocky rocky bottom, and I can see the base of Beechwood Island and my arms and legs feel numb but my fingers are cold. Slices of seaweed go past as I fall. And then I am up again, and breathing. I\u2019m okay, my head is okay, no one needs to cry for me or worry about me. I am fine, I am alive. I swim to shore. I really have a problem with the writing, but this is just a matter of taste . But then again, I've never been a fan of this type of prose. Needless to say, I don't like e.e. cummings. The writing is so often choppy, haphazardly punctuated. The first-person narrator also has a tendency to use very, very dramatic imagery to describe situations. Some situations are false. Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound, then from my eyes, my ears, my mouth. That, there, was a description of how she FELT. It confused me as fuck until I realized that she didn't actually get hurt, which made it even more confusing when she did actually hurt herself. Every time Gat said these things, so casual and truthful, so oblivious\u2014my veins opened. My wrists split. I bled down my palms. I went light-headed. I thought that was her being overdramatic again , until I realized that the guy was fucking bandaging her up afterwards. The main character has a huge tendency to use purple prose. She describes her migraines like they were the end of the world, which, I understand to some people they might be, but if you're getting a fucking migraine, there's really no bloody need to get all freaking poetic about it. A witch has been standing there behind me for some time, waiting for a moment of weakness. She holds an ivory statue of a goose. It is intricately carved. I turn and admire it only for a moment before she swings it with shocking force. It connects, crushing a hole in my forehead. I can feel my bone come loose. The witch swings the statue again and hits above my right ear, smashing my skull. Blow after blow she lands, until tiny flakes of bone litter the bed and mingle with chipped bits of her once-beautiful goose. That entire passage is one of many throughout the book about her headaches. I just couldn't take it. The Main Character : \u201cYou\u2019re filled with superiority, aren\u2019t you? You think you understand the world so much better than I do. I\u2019ve heard Gat talking. I\u2019ve seen you eating up his words like ice cream off a spoon. But you haven\u2019t paid bills, you haven\u2019t had a family, owned property, seen the world. You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, and yet you do nothing but pass judgment.\u201d Poor-little-rich-girl syndrome. She's beautiful, but wounded, and \"mysterious\" and revered, just for the sake of her blood alone, for the sake of her family's name alone. Think about it. If you were a Kennedy, it doesn't matter if you look like an elephant stepped on your head when you were born. People are still going to love you and worship you and whisper your name with reverence because you're a motherfucking Kennedy. It's this way with the Sinclairs, only there's no paparazzi following them around. All of the benefits, and no family curse. But somehow Cadence finds a way to be a rebel-without-a-cause anyway. She's rich. She's hypocritical about her wealth because she criticizes her own fucking family for being wealthy. She does stupid shit like give things away to random people because she can. Before the summer is over, Cadence's room will have been empty because she keeps giving shit away for no fucking reason. Cadence is unaware of others. She is spoiled. She takes her wealth for granted. She doesn't pay any attention to \"the help.\" One night, the four of us ate a picnic down on the tiny beach. Steamed clams, potatoes, and sweet corn. The staff made it. I didn\u2019t know their names. I'm sorry, but I can't sympathize with such a whiny person who's completely unaware of how privileged she is, headaches be damned. \u201cWho are Ginny and Paulo?\u201d Gat hits his fist into his palm. \u201cGinny is the housekeeper. Paulo is the gardener. You don\u2019t know their names and they\u2019ve worked here summer after summer. That\u2019s part of my point.\u201d My face heats with shame. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The Love Interest : \u201cYou\u2019re saying Granddad thinks you\u2019re Heathcliff?\u201d \u201cI promise you, he does,\u201d says Gat. \u201cA brute beneath a pleasant surface, betraying his kindness in letting me come to his sheltered island every year\u2014I\u2019ve betrayed him by seducing his Catherine, his Cadence. And my penance is to become the monster he always saw in me.\u201d Gat is the only interesting character in the book. He is Indian-American. Gat Patil. He is the nephew of her aunt's boyfriend, and they've known each other for years. He is self-aware. Too self-aware in the pretentious way that teenagers can often be, but his character feels authentically teenaged. I liked him. He is accepted into The Liars, but he's not altogether accepted in the family. Because of his skin color, because of his lack of family money, he feels left out. And I can sympathize with him. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he wants to be the guy who only likes white people,\u201d Gat went on. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s not supposed to be that guy. He\u2019s a Democrat, he voted for Obama\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s comfortable having people of color in his beautiful family.\u201d Gat is intelligent. Reasonable. Likeable. And I wonder why the fuck he cares about a waste of air like Cadence. ...more This is the kind of book that, when I finish reading it, I\u2019m like FINALLY and then throw the book out of the window (in this case not applicable because of digital copy so I'm doing it through a gif.)

This is my 3rd negative review/read this week and I\u2019m seriously pissed but will try to keep it cool. I didn\u2019t get the purpose of this book. Why were they called Liars anyway? Okay they lied but who doesn\u2019t? Why are they supposed to be so special? Because some of them are rich? So what? Many people are as well and it doesn\u2019t make them more interesting/special. (Did it annoy you? How I just wrote what I wrote? If it did, this is not the book for you.) It\u2019s like the author wanted to make this story \u2018phenomenal\u2019 and so damn poignant and thought that by adding some metaphorical sentences, a different writing style and a heavy recycled subject she would succeed. But she didn\u2019t. At least, not for me. I personally thought it felt very pretentious and TOO MUCH. The pacing is uneven and the story very repetitive. The characters, except maybe for Cady, the MC, are one dimensional and I couldn\u2019t connect with any one of them. Again with the subject, is it mainly about...rich-wants-to-date-\u2018poor\u2019-guy-aka-love-of-her-life-but-can-t-because-family? So confusing... but I guess that\u2019s it since THAT started a lot of stuff. The love story, by the way, is so so so dull. This is all because of the hype\u2026 Oh, the hype was there. It.IS.There. But we all know hype lies and loves doing it. This is not the type of book I usually read because it feels, just by reading the \u2018synopsis\u2019 (really? couldn\u2019t this book have at least a normal synopsis?) too sad/dark/eerie for me but, HEY, we all need to step out of our comfort zone from time to time. PLUS, John Green praised this book. He '' Thrilling, beautiful, and blisteringly smart, We Were Liars is utterly unforgettable. John Green, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Fault in Our Stars '' praised this book. And, since I finished reading The Fault in Our Stars not so long ago and loved it, I thought I\u2019d trust Green\u2019s judgement. Except, it was boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. The only parts I felt myself enjoying reading are the little \u2018stories\u2019 with the king and his 3 daughters. I really don\u2019t recommend this book. It\u2019s a waste of time because it\u2019s confusing as hell and doesn\u2019t even have a nice/normally written ending. I wish I could burn it. ...more This was, without a doubt, one of the most powerful and well-crafted books I have read in a really long time.

There's a moment where all is revealed and IT WAS PERFECT. 7) The consequential understanding. Everything suddenly clicked into place and it was glorious. 8) The side characters. I think sometimes side characters can feel inconsequential and here they felt really important. There weren't very many things I didn't like, to be honest, but there was one: 1) The title. It does't make sense to me. I don't want to say anything in case spoilers, but I don't think it's the perfect title. Two final things: 1) I have a theory. I have a theory about this book that I'm really excited to discuss so I'm going to make a video about it! 2) This book really made me cry. Like explode cry. Lots of tears.

But Bess has asked Mirren to do the same thing, and neither one of us begged Granddad for the fucking tablecloths.

Plus, I'm one of those people who\u00a0usually can easily figure out a plot twist and I didn't want to dive into something where a lot of people already mentioned figuring it out. But one thing did nag me a little in the back of my mind was that my Bookish Twin, Blythe from Finding Bliss in Books , LOVED it. I highly value her opinion when it comes to books, because we almost always agree. So when I happened to get my hands on the audiobook, I thought, \"What the hell? I was supposed to read and review this anyway, right?\" Let me tell you... WHOA. ***First off, I just wanna say that I don't know how the print compares to the audio and that it's possible I loved the book more than others because of the \u00a0excellent job of the narrator. I can see how the fragmented sentences could be a pain to read, but this might be one of those cases where it sounds better out loud. That being said, I if you haven't read this book, possibly check out the audio version first.*** Anyway, I was feeling very blas\u00e9 about\u00a0the first half. It felt like a really random story about a rich, white girl and her white girl problems, crying her white girl tears and I felt myself unsure about what the point of it all was. And maybe that makes me sound extremely heartless, but I couldn't relate to\u00a0the main character (no, I'm not even going to tell you her name because I want you to go in blind). But somewhere along the lines, I started to become intrigued with the story because it became this strange, wild thing that I couldn't piece together . Lockhart uses a very odd narration with fragmented sentences and strange descriptions, but I thought it was beautiful and unique. It added a very creepy layer on top the the existing oddness. It makes you question the main character, her account of the incident and the entire book. She's not very reliable and has the habit to cut off mid-sentence. I'm not sure if that was used as a way to distract the reader or if it was to used to make us question her sanity. Maybe a little bit of both. Either way, it worked on me. As things started to heat up and I reached the cusp of the climax, the narrator's voice increased in intensity. She began talking faster, became very emotional, then suddenly on the verge of tears! And I started thinking to myself, OH GOD NO. WHAT IS HAPPENING. And then IT was revealed and I was all, \"WHAT IS THIS LIFE? I REJECT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ENDING. NOOOOOOO!!!!\" So, naturally, I had a good cry and needed someone to hold me. By the end, I was all: https://twitter.com/Cuddlebuggery/sta... I know this review might not be the most helpful in the world, but it's true what everyone says about We Were Liars . You should absolutely go in blind, with no expectations and let this book take your feels as it sees fit.

I LOVE SECRETS!! I WANT TO KNOW THE SECRETS!!\" it's a very effective way of drumming up interest around a book. but the problem is, when you are prepared for a big twist, it is very easy to guess the big twist, which i did very early on. if you think you are just reading a book about some rich family and a girl with a faulty memory and a mysterious summer, with no tantalizingly bossy instructions about keeping the book's secrets, you might be more surprised when the reveal is revealed. but when such a big deal is made of SHHHHHHH, and you know you are expecting something unexpected, you will probably find it, and so reading the book just becomes an exercise in waiting for the character to figure it out. which is fine, but less effective in terms of shock value. i liked it anyway, but i think it would have been more fun to gasp in genuine surprise at the path it took. so forget i said anything, forget what the synopsis tells you to do, and just read it like you would any other book. this should help you forget everything you have ever known: http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450... ...more Tragic, yet hauntingly beautiful story. *5 Stars* There\u2019s not even a Scrabble word for how I\u2019m feeling right now\u2026 This story left me defeated, but its tragedy was paired equally with an unconventional beauty.

The plot in *5 Stars* There\u2019s not even a Scrabble word for how I\u2019m feeling right now\u2026 This story left me defeated, but its tragedy was paired equally with an unconventional beauty. It gripped me instantly to the point where I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about its mystery\u2026 Its intrigue. Its quiet calamity. The suspense is painted on rather thickly, which is not to say that readers will not form an accurate theory early on. But the journey remains worth it whether you\u2019ve Sherlock Holmes\u2019d this one or not. The plot introduces itself in a vague manner and slowly unravels. I found that the messages held more power than the characters delivering them\u2014the sum was definitely greater than its parts. Which underlined the overall tone nicely. This review may seem just as ambiguous as the story itself, but it must be if you wish to obtain the full effect of its delivery. I will say this, however: We Were Liars is a haunting portrayal of a group of teenagers who have formed a sacred bond; each one striving to be free and longing for acceptance. They consider love more important than social and economic stature, and are displeased with the prejudices surrounding their world. They are young. They are passionate. They are imperfect. They each suffer their own personal injustice. And this is their story. What if we could somehow stop being the Beautiful Sinclair Family and just be a family? What if we could stop being different colors , different backgrounds, and just be in love? The writing was unique and although it may not suit everyone\u2019s taste, I relished in it. I\u2019ve noticed some readers point out the use of purple prose. While I certainly see where they\u2019re coming from, I\u2019d say the writing displays merely purple patches. I thought the author\u2019s use of descriptive imagery was creative and applied with a gentle hand\u2014nothing over-the-top or showy. The story is told through the voice of a confused, emotional, and dejected eighteen year old girl\u2014and the writing remained consistent with her distinctive perspective. It was poetic and profound\u2014drifting in as a gentle breeze and building to the swirling force of a hurricane. It may not knock your socks off, but it certainly took my breath away. She made me act normal. Because I was. Because I could. She told me to breathe and sit up. I\u2019d recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a plot that persuades you to wonder. To readers who can accept the bittersweet circumstances of life displayed within their fiction. This is not a character-driven novel. The story shines brighter. I don't think I ever fully connected with any character at all--and the fact that I was moved to tears by the finish is what made this a five-star read, for me. Someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments. I get the same thing spending an hour with you.

I guess? but why go to all that trouble setting up class critique and racial tensions and family drama and dressing it up in fairy tale finery when that will all just be thrown away on a maudlin twist ending with a corny moral message: \"Be a little kinder\"... ugh! those ideas went nowhere those ideas were rendered pointless because in the end the book is not a scouring brillo pad after all, it's just another soppy wet sponge. rub that sponge on your face it will look like you cried! ...more WOW. Just... wow... \"Read it. And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.\" This book was great, you guys! I love the writing style. It wasn't confusing at all! It was totally not annoying! :) I loved the characters. They were so complex and not bland at all. They definitely didn't want to make me want to shoot myself in the head! :) I knew what was going on and I enjoyed this story a lot! The ending was just beautiful. Literally all I can ask for! :) I LOVE THIS SM I AM CRYING! :) :) :) :) :) :) First,I predict the ending after 25% of the novel ..and Yes,I was right..

The plot itself is one you can't talk about or read about as you're bound to find out spoilers. It's the kind of story where the story itself is a spoiler from very early on. There are hints floating in every corner, pieces of this carefully constructed puzzle laid out for you to put together. My advice: go into this with zero expectations and you might find yourself as enthralled as I was! Although it's a twist I have seen before in different variations (and thus I wasn't completely caught off guard by the ending), it never fails to give me goosebumps and sting at my poor heart. The cast is large, and the dark, twisted fairy-tale-like quality is ever-present inside this tale revolving around greed, power, and material things. This tone is maintained with actual short fairy-tale retellings scattered throughout that bore an eerie resemblance to the present story. It did take me a bit to get all the characters and different disaccords in order - the cryptic, mind-boggly nature of this plot and writing makes it hard to make sense of what's being conveyed at times, but this is clearly purposeful and I ended up impressed by its cleverness. But anyways, this review has to stay short because, la la la - no spoilers - it's that kind of read. Plus the blurb told me to lie, so maybe this review is full of crock and this book is just a bunch of dancing elephants.

A completely unconvincing twist in the last twenty pages resolves the mystery in a way that is both improbably gruesome and also lightly dismissed by the author. The real moral questions raised by the subject of the book, including racism, land ownership, inheritance, materialism, greed, and manipulation, are acted out in flat, white-hat/black-hat morality plays by stock characters of little or no complexity. Those questions are then answered by an intruding author's voice that patronizes the reader by declaring single answers to every moral issue raised. The same problems exist on the literary level. Interesting tools, like allegory and literary allusions, are brought into the narrative, but are then executed in a heavy-handed, amateurish way that leaves no room for the reader to respond or engage, simply enter stage right, spell out their own significance, and exit stage left. Finally, the main character, despite being the pov character in a novel of psychological recovery, is a completely empty vehicle for plot and the author's voice, with no identifiable personality or characteristics by the end of the book. The politics in the book are good. The plot is an unfortunate mismatch of borrowed material. The characters are overused stereotypes. The incorporation of sophisticated literary techniques is clumsy and embarrassing. ...more WARNING: This book is a liar and it will cause you to cry for the next three hours, it crushes souls and it severely destroy hearts. Proceed with caution. I spent the whole time sobbing. trying to catch my breath. then sobbing again. We Were Liars scarred me and Im broken way beyond repair. And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE. You can listen to my fanmix of We Were Liars on 8tracks. I'm pretty disappointed in this one. To me, it was very predictable and underwhelming. However, I did really like atmosphere of the story, the characters, and the writing. Listening to it as an audiobook definitely enhanced the experience. ____________________________________________ \u201cBe a little kinder than you have to.\u201d ____________________________________________ Okay so where to begin.I liked this book,you can see it by my rating,but I don't feel it ended right.I am not saying it was a bad ending,not at all,I enjoyed it,but there was no justice.The next part of the review will contain spoilers because I want to discuss with you some part of this book.Okay so let's begin: ____________________________________________ \u201cDo not a ____________________________________________ \u201cBe a little kinder than you have to.\u201d ____________________________________________ Okay so where to begin.I liked this book,you can see it by my rating,but I don't feel it ended right.I am not saying it was a bad ending,not at all,I enjoyed it,but there was no justice.The next part of the review will contain spoilers because I want to discuss with you some part of this book.Okay so let's begin: ____________________________________________ \u201cDo not accept an evil you can change.\u201d ____________________________________________ 1.I don't know if you felt the same,but for me,The Liars were the ones with problems and they were spoiled as hell.I mean come on,they had everything,they had a whole island which was huge,and they had all of those places they could have avoided hearing their mothers fight and complain,also could have avoided the dislike of Gat by the granddad,and let's be honest,these things happen to a lot of families out there,and it was not something unbearable,and as I recall,Harris wasn't that bad,like the had preferences but never took that to it's limits.But,yet,the Liars,decided that the best way to stop the fighting and everything was to burn the house down.I can tell you a million reasons why this idea was wrong,but I am surprised that Gat didn't realize them.Like Gat,come on,you were the smart one on the group,but you helped Cadence with the plan.And for more,the lit the freaking house knowing that her friends were there,like that part was really freaking stupid.Like you know that the house leaks on gasoline or whatever liquid they used and before knowing that the friend on the floors above and from the basement are out and safe,she lit the freaking room to fire.I know I might be harsh a little,and I know they were fifteen,but I think someone has to mention it,because we all know that Cadence was the main character and I,personally,don't feel bad for what happened to her,and to be honest,I think she deserved worse,because it was her fault.All I want to say is that what she did is way to much wrong and I don't think a mistake like this should be mention in a young adult book and end the way it did,because people would think that every mistake is forgivable,and for me and for others I believe,this is one of the worst crimes out there.Killing people,even if you don't do it intentionally.I am sorry if I offended anyone,or if you like Cadence,that is totally fine,it's just that Johnny and Mirren,they were my favorite characters,and I was so angry that they died,they were so fragile and influenced and manipulated. ____________________________________________ \u201cAlways do what you're afraid to do.\u201d ____________________________________________ I just finished reading the book and so many feels are tumbling so I may be confused and wrong in the text above,but that's what I am feeling and wanted to express it to you.Beside the summary,I like the writing style,it was rich and beautiful and I would recommend this book to readers out there.It's a very dark book and I assure you that you will find it very interesting. ...more Eh. This was not the book for me, which I was disappointed to discover after two book-friends and an admired blogger all raved about this one. If I had expected less, I probably would have enjoyed it more, but as it stands, it ticked a few boxes for my various readerly pet peeves: 1) A first person narrator 2) An unreliable narrator (This is not a spoiler. Read the title. And the narrator has amnesia.) 3) The narrator has amnesia. 4) In the last 30 pages or so, the narrator/author make a big reveal Eh.

If those things don't bother you, or at least don't bother you as much as they bother me, then you'll probably enjoy this book. I would have liked it more if it weren't hyped the way it was. I've seen the same tropes done better, and from what I knew of this author, I frankly expected more. Beyond that, I thought that the sibling and cousin relationships were particularly ill-drawn and I had trouble suspending my disbelief that these kids spend every summer together on their own private island, year after year, and yet have weirdly stilted dialogue. The adult relationships and the parent-child relationships all rang true to me, though. The big reveal at the end is incredibly tragic but only somewhat of a stunner, but unlike the folks here who claimed to have cried buckets, I was dry-eyed. If you read enough fiction featuring amnesiac and/or mentally unbalanced main characters, the ending to this book won't come totally out of left field. The only thing that left me truly feeling WTF was the actual execution of the Liars's Big Plan That Backfired. It's almost like they don't know the basics of physics/chemistry/accelerants. I won't say more because beyond there, spoilers lie. ...more Warning to everyone who reads We Were Liars: Be prepared to scrape your chin off the floor. With a forklift.

Then there's all the dramatic purple prose, that makes me roll my eyes so hard they fall out of my sockets, and then my eye sockets bleed into my mouth, and my bones disintegrate and my brain cells explode because they can't deal with the drama, and then I die a bloody death. For those of you who haven't read the book and think \"Well, that escalated quickly\", this is how the main character describes it when bad things happen to her. Her brains liquify on the floor until they bubble, her wrists bleed all over the place, and I don't know what else. So, even though it's short, I'm not going to finish it.
