She has found a way to make the werewolf tale that much more enjoyable to this lover of the genre. She writes characters that convince me that there must be werewolves out there, and that they aren't all ravening beasts. That there is an entire spectrum. That they are lonely, in need of love, always fighting a battle of control against their animal natures, or that some have completely given into their animal side. That they form bonds of family and love that wrap around them, and when those bonds are taken away, it has the power to destroy them. Conversely, the bonds of love and pack, can heal a long-broken heart. The characters in this story show that spectrum of wolves very well. By the end of the story, they felt like people I knew. Oh, and there were some characters that I crossed myself in hopes that I never encountered their likes. Mariposa, oh, how she gave me the shudders. Oh, and Bran.... Could I love him more now? Even though he has some really scary aspects to his personality? Although that just increased his appeal to me. What control this man has. How tortured he truly is. Ms. Briggs, do write a separate story for Bran, I humbly ask. Charles and Anna: More continued goodies with their nuanced, layered relationship. It's a symbiotic relationship, almost. It would seem that Anna is the weak one, and Charles is the strong one. Not so. Anna's presence brings strength and calmness to Charles. She saves his life numerous times in this story, in fact. And Charles gives Anna that reason and that purpose she had not found before. She loves him so much it scares her. He heals the broken places deep inside of her with his love and devotion. And, he brings her to a home where she had been lost before. I love that not only does this couple come together, but Anna comes to form deep, important relationships with other wolves in this story, who are in need of the peace that she can give them as an Omega wolf. There were scenes that clutched at my emotions and wouldn't let go. When Anna sings to Asil and Bran, and they fall with their heads in her lap. These troubled wolves finding the peace that an evil adversary had denied them. It was just wonderful to watch. There are dark and scary moments in this story, as Charles, Anna, and Walter, a wolf they encounter, face a very malevolent entity from the old wolf, Asil's past. Oh, there was plenty of horror in this story. Of the more subtle, not in your face, but very unnerving variety. And the power of this person, powerful enough to take over a character who is known for his absolute strength and control. Shuddering thinking about it. Yes, I'm gushing. I waited a few days to write this review, trying to get my thoughts in order. For me, this is urban fantasy at its best. Cry Wolf truly is an exemplary werewolf story to me (<---B>and that's saying a lot from me</---B>). It's the kind of book that you don't want to put down for anything. Ms. Briggs with her misleadingly simple way of telling a story, will have likely a profound effect on you, if you appreciate really good storytelling. Watch out if you haven't read her yet. In the end, I can't speak for other readers. I won't even try. I can only speak for myself. This was a fantastic story. I hope that others who read this enjoy it as much as I did. ...more Friendly warning: if you love this series in general, and this instalment in particular, you might want to consider stepping back a bit.

I could brilliantly and ever-so cleverly go on and on and on about how absolutely delightful this book is, but I am desperately pressed for time (tourists to kill and all that), so I'll just give you the Absolutely Delightful Alpha Beta Gamma I Know My Greek Alphabet Shortlist (ADABGIKMGAS\u2122) in its stead (sounds much cooler than \"instead,\" if you ask me). You are, as usual, very welcome . \u2620 The lovely heroine in this lovely story makes all pity partying, whiny woeing is me heroines look like ridiculous amateurs . Someone should give this pathetic crybaby a lifetime achievement award or something. Well, either that or shoot her in the head to put an end to her misery .

Before I started reading a lot of romance and indie reads, Urban Fantasy/PNR was my genre of choice. I started reading her Mercy Thompson series in 2006 when I was still in college and I was hooked. I\u2019m not sure what took me so long to read this spin off series, but I\u2019ve really enjoyed the first book! If you\u2019ve read the Mercy books, you\u2019ve met Charles. He\u2019s the only \u2018born\u2019 werewolf, brother of Samuel, and son of the Marrok. Charles is also known as the \u2018enforcer\u2019. He\u2019s a bad ass. He keeps wolves in line. He\u2019s also called his da\u2019s \u2018Pet Assassin\u2019. Apparently there is a prequel novella I missed (luckily my husband read it and filled me in) where Charles goes on a mission and ends up saving Anna. More than that, their wolves decide to mate. This is not a normal way of doing things. Usually, its the people who mate first, then the wolves see if they\u2019re comparable. Things are different for Charles and Anna. Everything is happening so fast and backwards and it\u2019s confusing for her. \u201cIt is your right to know that although we\u2019re compatible, you can still refuse me.\u201d \u201cCan you refuse me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never heard of a biding happening backwards like ours. Brother Wolf chose you, chose your wolf and left me to follow him. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want to refuse you.\u201d Anna is a rare breed of wolf. She is an Omega. This is not the same as submissive. She can calm other wolves, it keeps a pack in line. It\u2019s so useful to have. When Charles goes to his next mission to track down a rouge wolf causing trouble, Bran (aka the Marrok) decides it would be best for Anna to come along. Maybe she can defuse the situation before the enforcer has to come out. While on the hunt, they find a newly turned wolf named Walter. I adored Walter. He doesn\u2019t know much about what\u2019s going on, but he wants to help. \u201cWelcome to our world. Witches, werewolves, and things that go bump in the night.\u201d This is were things start to really get interesting. A rouge wolf out in the woods killing is what they signed up for. What\u2019s really going on is so much more! Charles and Anna must work together to fix this with as few casualties as possible. And while they\u2019re doing this, they\u2019re also working on them. Figuring out their relationship as they go. \u201cShe understood his passion because she felt the same way: as if nothing was more important than the touch of her skin to his, as if she'd die if he left her.\u201d I love love love Charles. I was such an Adam fan in the other series, not caring much for Samuel, that I didn\u2019t pay much attention to Charles. I love his protectiveness, dominance and I love when his wolf takes over. Anna was great too. She has been through so much and is finally healing. I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that you get multiple pov\u2019s in this story. Not just Charles and Anna, but also Bran, Walter, and another wolf who plays a large part, Asil (aka the Moor). I think that the writing was great and the narration in the audiobook was fantastic. The only reason I\u2019m not giving 5 stars is I just didn\u2019t feel this was focused enough on Charles and Anna, their actual relationship etc. Also, there was one or two rushed sex scenes and I wanted more than that. I\u2019m hoping as the series continues, there is more steam and we get more of a focus on the main couple! Still, this was good read for me and I\u2019m looking forward to reading more of the series. ...more 5/5 stars Anna Anna is a very rare Omega wolf, this means that she has a calming effect on other wolves as long as she is calm. Omega wolves are to be cherished and protected above all others because they keep the pack sane. Apparently though her last pack didn't get the memo. Anna was changed against her will, was beaten and passed around the pack at the orders of her previous Alpha. Three years later came her salvation, a salvation named Charles. Now after what was done to her it is logical tha 5/5 stars Anna Anna is a very rare Omega wolf, this means that she has a calming effect on other wolves as long as she is calm. Omega wolves are to be cherished and protected above all others because they keep the pack sane. Apparently though her last pack didn't get the memo. Anna was changed against her will, was beaten and passed around the pack at the orders of her previous Alpha. Three years later came her salvation, a salvation named Charles. Now after what was done to her it is logical that Anna was a bit skitish during the book. 3 years of abuse have left her flinching every time a dominant wolf so much as breathes in her diraction. This isn't to say that the girl doesn't have a backbone, something that becomes obvious every time someone corners hers and as she slowly comes to the realization that no one is going to hurt her at her new home. Charles Charles is a very, very dominant wolf even though his father is the Alpha of his pack. When he realizes how Anna has been treated every protective instinct in him goes wild. If you combine this to the fact that his wolf recognizes her as his mate you get an overly protective and overly possessive wolf. I like Charles. He is a dominant but he doesn't try to assert his dominance over Anna. He is protective of those he loves(even when they can take care of themselves), he is loyal and he doesn't show any bitterness over the fact that he follows his father and has become his \"pet assassin\". I also enjoy the fact that for a change in a shifter book the male is happy to have found his mate. He wants Anna, no fighting, no resisting. The wolves We see a lot of new wolves in this book and we also have Walter's, Bran's and Asil's POVs besides Anna's and Charles'. Bran I love Bran. The Marrok seems a bit Jaded in this book. not really all this strange since he is hundreds of years old and he has seen many loved ones die. I think Bran brings a little tragedy to the story. (view spoiler) [ I felt so bad about his relationship with Leah... I think he is kind of an idiot at how he is handling his \"marriage\" issues though. (hide spoiler) ] Leah Leah is Bran's mate and although she is a bitch I think she has every reason to be. On that account I think Bran's at fault. Samuel Another sad spot in the overall story. I want to know if and how he becomes happy. Asil And here we come to the side story. Asil is a wolf who is over a thousand years old. Asil has some issues as well. I found his story heart-breaking and maybe even a bit more interesting than Anna's. I loved Asil. Sage Sage is a wolf in the pack. We don't see much of her but I do hope she will end up with Asil. Walter Walter was a newly turned wolf. He was turned against his will and lived in the mountain for months before Anna and Charles found him without knowing exactly what he had become. He was a good man who lived on the mountain alone to save others from his flashbacks to the Vietnam war. (view spoiler) [I was sad he dies but he died as a hero. (hide spoiler) ] We have some other wolves but they are not as important. The story was nice. More sweet than full of action although it did have some of this as well. Although reading about the people you might think the book was overly dramatic I have to say it wasn't. It was nice to see how Anna and Charles develop during the story, how Anna starts to trust people again, how Bran and Asil go on with their lives after their tragedies. I won't tell you more, read the book. It is worth it. ********************14/7/2014********************* BR with Aly !!

That\u2019s what happened to me with Cry Wolf, the first book in the Alpha & Omega series. I\u2019ve been reading the Mercy Thompson books for years now, and every so often when I review one of the sequels with a less than stellar rating, someone will pop up and say \u2013 \u201coh, you have to read the OTHER series, it\u2019s better!\u201d Or, \u201cyou have to read about Anna and Charles, their stories are just as good.\u201d I\u2019ve seen the same recommendations in groups as well. So\u2026I have finally hopped on board, only to fall off again! From the start, this book lost a brownie point and a half when I found the first page was diving into an already-existing relationship. Ugh bug. I know from internet snooping that there is a prequel to this, a short story, where the two first meet. But on principle I\u2019m stomping my foot and saying I don\u2019t want to have to read a short story to fully enjoy and connect with a first book in a series. That\u2019s not how my reading life typically works. So, I still kept digging into the book and ignoring the fact that the mated pair have already met, they\u2019ve already established this serious life-changing bond off-page, and we\u2019re starting a book where she\u2019s moving out of her apartment and into his house. I kept thinking there may be recaps later that would make me see how they first met and understand the connection, something that would explain the bond and make me actually care about their situation, but no. It continues as is and I had issues accepting that. It didn\u2019t help that I felt no spark from Charles \u2013 people seem to love him but I don\u2019t get the charm. To me he lacked naughty humor, he was serious as a nail, and I couldn\u2019t find much personality in there. Anna was average as a heroine but didn\u2019t stand out for me either \u2013 she seems sweet, but nothing that makes me sit up and take notice. Together I couldn\u2019t\u2019 observe their sizzle and chemistry. What I DID like reading about was seeing more of Bran (the man just draws attention whatever series he graces), more background story on his bitchy mate Leah, and I seriously liked the intro of sweet Warren. Those side characters were much more interesting. The book was finally picking up until the author did a \u201csad, bad thing\u201d to a person I connected with. The storyline was dull for the first half \u2013 it became more interesting when they set out to find the rogue wolf and do investigations. There was tension and well-done scenes \u2013 the villain was a worthy, witchy one. I don\u2019t find flaw with the conflict, crisis and resolution \u2013 but I did find the first half of the book unnecessarily lackluster. The last of heart and emotion from the two mains didn\u2019t help that. I doubt I\u2019ll give the series another shot, even though some have encouraged at least trying the second book. I won\u2019t order it fresh, shiny and new, but I\u2019ll do an attempt if I run across a used copy. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll have to continue having fun with Mercy\u2019s characters and seeing Bran from a distance. ...more Cry Wolf is the 1st book in Patricia Briggs Alpha and Omega Series, which concentrates on Charles Conrick, who we met previously in the her Mercy Thompson Series.

I see it as something that adds character to an already complex and strong female heroine. I can\u2019t wait to see where she goes from here! Charles is his father\u2019s pet assassin and although he\u2019s the quiet, lonesome guy, he opens up to Anna a lot. I love the way he looks out of Anna without smothering her. I can definitely see how compatible they are with one another. But my favourite new character has to be Asil, the Moor. I LOVED THIS GUY! His story is so tragic and heartbreaking! It\u2019s the one thing that really carries this book from a good novel to an amazing novel! My eyes were glued to the page whenever Asil had page time. From his very first appearance in the book, I was hooked! Love, love, LOVE him! I also enjoyed reading from Walter and Bran\u2019s POV. We see Bran in the MT series but in this series, we get a closer look inside the mind of the Marrok. I would love to read more about his relationship with Leah even though she is such a bitch to everyone. It\u2019s still interesting enough to hold my interest, because Bran is one of my favourite characters! Being a huge Mercy fan, I have to say that this Alpha & Omega series is really making a good impression so far!

I loved the characters, learning more about what it means to be omega, and the author\u2019s switch to the third person POV writing style. It was howling good! I\u2019ve always been drawn to Bran, Charles & Asil, so no arm twisting was necessary in order to convince me to spend more time with these alpha males. I enjoyed digging deeper into Cornick\u2019s Native American half, and getting a closer look at the aspects that make him so unique among his kind including his ability to spawn clothing, and his Brother Wolf. Up until this point I hadn\u2019t interacted much with The Moor, but I really liked him in the ROSES IN WINTER short, and was ecstatic when I discovered that this novel\u2019s main plot line revolved around him. The reasons behind Asil wanting Bran to kill him are now crystal clear, and I loved that Anna was able to bring him some much needed peace. And, hanging with the Marrok is always a pleasure, even when he goes Beowulf. Mercy went through some tough times in Briggs\u2019 other series, however she\u2019s got nothing on Anna\u2014the poor girl! Who would have thought that she\u2019d find solace in the arms of a hitman among a pack of psychotic werewolves, but that\u2019s true love for ya. Exploring what makes her character tick was a real delight, and I enjoyed learning about her omega traits. She\u2019s also a rarity among weres, and when combined with Charles\u2019 oddities, the two satisfied my fur craving to the nth degree. I liked how the author took her time in developing their relationship, and transformed Anna\u2019s unfortunate past into a healing balm for the Marrok\u2019s misfits. Her confrontation with Leah was extremely gratifying, and this book\u2019s ending made a big puddle of goo out of my heart. I had some concerns about the male narrator because I\u2019ve had problems with their female voices in the past; however Holter Graham quickly proved his worth as Anna and Charles. The former was soft without being breathy, and I adored his Native / Welsh lilt, it was very well-done. The third person POV certainly helped on both accounts, and he definitely added an extra layer of enjoyment to my listening experience. I always use the first installment to gauge a narrator\u2019s performance, and Graham\u2019s suitability for this series is uncanny. When I reached the midway point, I was already downloading HUNTING GROUND to my iPhone because I just couldn\u2019t get enough of Briggs\u2019 characters or his voice.

Bran, the local Alpha, sends his injured son Charles to solve the case. Of course, he brings along his peace giving (Omega) sweetie, Anna. There was a stronger romance vibe to this book, than in the Mercy books. The plot seemed more contrived. 1. Make it clear that Anna and Charles are soul mates. Cue love scene. 2. Have the lovers trudge through the snow in pursuit of the rogue wolf who is killing people in the wildernees of Montana. 3. Make the Alpha (Charles) wolf vulnerable and soft by keeping him injured, from delayed healing of silver bullet injuries, for the entire book. 3. Have a nasty, black witch, who is seemingly unstoppable appear out of nowhere. And, wa ha ha, cackle, cackle, discover that she is behind the rogue wolf in her attempt to find Asil, another ancient wolf with a secret past. It was just like a dance: 1, 2, 3, kill the witch, marry and be happy. What did I like best?

The story is a prequel to this book in which we get to meet Anna, a reluctant member of the Chicago Pack werewolves. Three years ago, she was turned against her will and since then went through emotional, physical and sexual abuse by her Pack. This was done to 'break her' as Anna didn't automatically act submissive around more dominant wolves. Anna is special: she is an Omega, which means she's protective and brings peace to a pack with her natural ability to soothe the wolf-part of a Were. When Charles Cornick, the enforcer and son of the Marrok (the leader of the North American Werewolves) comes to Chicago to investigate the issue, he has an immediate attraction to Anna. Better yet, his 'Brother Wolf' has too. As it happens Anna and Charles' wolf counterparts pretty soon see each other as \"mated\". The human counterparts however, especially Anna's -traumatized as she is- need a while to get to know each other. And that's where Cry Wolf starts off. Anna goes back to the Marrok's territory in Montana with Charles and tries to find her place in the new life she's got presented. In the mean time there's a rogue on the loose which needs to be brought in. Unlike the Mercy Thompson novels, the emphasis in Cry Wolf was less on the action and more on the romance. Which was good for two reasons. One : the love story was very well done. There's a lot of awkwardness, tension, misinterpretation of feelings going on between Anna and Charles. Charles, being his father's assassin for over 150 years, is not good with words, doesn't like to be touched and is feared by just about everyone... but with Anna he is so incredibly patient, gentle and sweet. And Anna: she just wants to like him back but she needs time and trust to overcome her inhibitions. I loved how it was written out and it was very endearing in general. Two : there really wasn't that much action to begin with. Only in the last half of the book is there more excitement in that department. And still, the ending is a bit of a let down. To me, Anna and Charles just as well could have stayed home and be awkward with each other for a while longer, I'd enjoyed that more. In general: Briggs' writing style is simple but effective. She has a nice way of portraying her characters. I especially liked reading about Charles' perspective, I find him more interesting than Anna. The bad part is that Briggs' plot in this book seemed really simple too. Not much really happens and too much is based on coincidence. I think I wouldn't have minded a break from the romance if the action parts were better thought out. Still, Cry Wolf was an enjoyable read. The 3 star rating seems a bit harsh, but 4 would have been just too much. ...more Cry Wolf (Alpha & Omega, #1), Patricia Briggs \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0632\u0648\u0632\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u06af -

Werewolves tackle the wicked wicked witch. Bloodlust and madness is about to descend on the icy mountains of Montana.

Told in 3rd person, I liked getting various perspectives as the POV transitioned from Anna to Charles to Bran to Asil, with the prologue in Walter's eyes. (Some readers might not like the head hopping, but I was fine with it.) My take on CRY WOLF: The villain is wicked, credible, and textured, the plot cohesive, suspenseful, and contained (but the beginning is abrupt if you've not read the prequel, Alpha & Omega: A Companion Novella to Cry Wolf . In the prequel, set in Chicago, Anna meets Charles and moves to his home in Montana. It's good!). Of all the books I have read by Briggs, this plot is quite possibly the best. It makes complete sense. The characters add up, too (except Anna psychologically recovers from the abuse in Chicago too quickly, but that is explained away as a function of her inner wolf, so okay). A few secondary characters are quite sympathetic, namely Walter (loved him !!) and Asil (intriguing and tragic). The book might disappoint fans of nonstop fight scenes from page one. The action doesn't really get going till about 50%, but I was fine with that. I appreciated the normal pace of the first half of the book, getting to know the setting and the characters, and enjoying a mildly smexy scene or two. Once the battle begins, it's supercharged action till nearly the end. THE CHARACTERS: Main characters, Anna Latham and Charles Cornick: Black hair flowing to his waist, Charles Cornick, his powerful father's enforcer and -- well -- killer, is an alpha werewolf by nature, even though his sire (Bran Cornick, \"The Marrrok\") bears the true title Alpha, commanding all the werewolves in North America. (see what the term \"Marrock\" refers to, further down). Distanced from others by his \"enforcer\" position, alone and aloof for much of his 200 years, feared by all except his beloved father and older brother Samuel, Charles finally finds his mate in Anna Latham, an omega werewolf. Yup! It's sweet. Charles, the stoic son of a mystical Salish native (Blue Jay Woman) simply cannot believe the fierce joy and deep peace Anna brings to his very soul -- and to his inner beast (Brother Wolf). Like Charles, Anna has also been lonely, but only for three years, since she \"changed\" into a werewolf at age 20 and was isolated from friends and family. Before that she was happy enough, attending college for a music degree, working in a music store, running in marathons, etc. After the change, she suffered vicious abuse, both sexual and physical, from the pack in Chicago (see prequel, Alpha and Omega). As a result, Anna has learned to retreat into her inner wolf, to let her animal endure the pain and terror. Now, with Charles fiercely watching her back, there's no need for fear, so Anna, an \"omega\" by nature, can finally become a gentle (but non-subservient) peace-bringer to her pack, perceptive and intuitive. She can develop the gift she was born to give, aided by her protective instincts, her music, and her sensitive compassion for tortured souls. Not a moment too soon, either. Together, they must defeat a very wicked, very old witch. Secondary Characters: Werewolves in Montana: Charles & Anna, Bran & Leah, Samuel, Sage, Asil \"The Moor\" (aka Hussan), Taggart (Tag), Walter Rice, the Vietnam war vet (loved him to pieces!) Others: Mariposa (Mary), Sarai, a few werewolves in Chicago (Boyd, George) About Bran: This book contains some great scenes with Bran as the POV shifts to him several times. We learn the back-story regarding Bran (and Samuel's) days in Old England, when they were both controlled by a witch till they killed, escaped, and sought refuge in a Welsh forest. I read at Briggs' website that Bran was named after Sir Marrok, one of the knights in King Arthur's court. According to legend, Sir Marrok's wife forced him to remain in werewolf form for seven years, by hiding his clothes (no clothing, no shifting). So maybe Bran dates back to around the fifth century. At any rate, in this book, Asil reflects on how Bran's legend influenced poems like Beowulf (told around 850-ish). Links to Mercy Thompson series: In Moon Called (MT#1) a teenager in Chicago is attacked by werewolves, changed, caged, drugged, and sold. His name is Alan MacKenzie Frasier (Mercy calls him Mac). In this story, Charles goes to Chicago to deal with the rogue werewolves who did it (Leo, Justin, etc.). Charles first meets his \"omega\" wolf Anna in Chicago. As far as cross-series characters go, Cry Wolf includes many scenes with Bran and a few with Samuel, but Adam and Mercy are only mentioned. Asil the Moor is a powerful werewolf who plays a good-sized role in this book and in MT #7, Frost Burned .

Ms. Briggs not only gives us original werewolf lore but she also puts the reader inside their minds. We get a glimpse of the constant battle for control over the animal instincts of the wolf. The author also weaves in some Native American magic into her wolf lore. The novel is set in Montana and the majestic wilderness of the Cabinet Mountains, a great playground for the werewolves. I fell in love with Charles Cornick when I read On the Prowl. Charles is part Native American, part werewolf. He is magical, sexy, and deadly. Charles is Bran\u2019s son, and the pack enforcer. Charles\u2019 wolf or Brother Wolf as he refers to him, falls immediately for Anna and his protective instincts are dominant. Anna is a special type of wolf-- an Omega, a type of wolf that can calm other wolves. The Omega does not have to obey the Alpha wolf. Omegas are extremely rare and special. Anna is damaged goods. Forced to become a werewolf against her wishes, she was subjected to horrifying abuse. Anna is a survivor and she proves to be brave, strong, and resourceful despite her hardships. Anna is also a very likable character. Charles and Anna are perfect for each other. It\u2019s actually a very sweet love story. The inner wolves chose each other as mates before their human selves were aware. The secondary characters make this story come to life. Asil is an old wolf, and he is very mysterious. I love how his past is slowly revealed. I first \u201cmet\u201d Bran when I read the first two Mercy books. Bran is a multi-dimensional character. He is the head of all the wolves and is very powerful, though at first glance, he does not seem to be so authoritarian. Bran chose to be in a loveless relationship because he did not want to lose another love again. I really wish Bran would get his own book. I hope to get to the next book Hunting Ground soon. ...more *** 3.75. *** A buddy read with the MacHalo Freaks! A very pleasant read in the world of Mercy Thompson.

While looking for the elusive lone wolf they stumble upon something malevolent and cunning which poses a serious threat to all wolfs in the aeria and possibly in North America. Bad guys do some damage, good guys survive, mostly... It is an example of an earlier style of writing an UF novel, which is more linear and compact than the more aggressive style the genre has gone towards in the last 5 years, but it is a good read. I recommend it to all UF fans and especially those who can do with less violence and slower character development.

They are both such fascinating characters, especially considering how old they both are and how Asil actually used to practice Islam. I wonder if that will ever factor more into the story! Regardless, a pretty solid first book. I have faith in Patricia Briggs that Charles and Anna's relationship will not make me feel weird in the next books! ETA: One thing I will say however that I forgot to earlier is that I feel like Anna's previous abuse is never really touched upon, and I don't know how I feel about it. Especially considering how much it has effected Anna. At the end of the book it seems almost like it never really happened and all is well, so yeah. Not really sure how I feel about it because I don't really think it was \"handled\" so to speak. ...more **4.5 stars** My first book by Patricia Briggs and I adored it. Really great urban fantasy combined with one of my favorite narrators (Holter Graham)= match made in heaven! Though I didn't read the prequel novella and I've never read the Mercy Thompson series, I had no problem following along with this book. Fab audiobook and a very promising start to a series. I enjoyed this book but WARNING: Get the novella before you read this. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's VERY CONFUSING and not satisfying to not have read the novella first. Believe me, I did it. Bad idea, shoulda added it to the book I think. Enjoyed it though, the character was very unlike Mercy but still I enjoyed! 4.5 Stars Cry Wolf is the first book in Patricia Briggs' \"Alpha & Omega\" series, and it picks up the day after the prequel novella Alpha and Omega . I, quite simply, loved this book. What's there not to love? Charles, Bran, Anna, Bran, Samuel, Bran ? Well, okay, there's Leah not to love, but that's not the point. The point is that this book is fantastic, fantasmic, if you will. I loved the story; it didn't feel contrived and used up at all. I loved the characters so much, too. Even more than in the prequ Cry Wolf is the first book in Patricia Briggs' \"Alpha & Omega\" series, and it picks up the day after the prequel novella Alpha and Omega . I, quite simply, loved this book. What's there not to love? Charles, Bran, Anna, Bran, Samuel, Bran ? Well, okay, there's Leah not to love, but that's not the point. The point is that this book is fantastic, fantasmic, if you will. I loved the story; it didn't feel contrived and used up at all. I loved the characters so much, too. Even more than in the prequel, we see more sides of Charles than just the emotionless enforcer and the blank mask he wears for the public. We see a man who loves with his whole heart, who protects those that he loves with his very being. He gets angry, possessive, tired, sad, happy, gentle, and so many other things that one may not expect from Charles if they were just basing their opinion off of the Charles we see in the \"Mercy Thompson\" books. He's far more complex than one could ever imagine. Then there's Anna. Strong, troubled Anna. With this book, she still struggles with the side effects of the ways she was brutalized by her old pack. It takes her a while, but she finally accepts all that she and Charles can be together, and that inspires in her a strength that she hadn't exhibited since before she was forcefully Changed. And, although she's an Omega--a wolf that calms the others around them--Anna gives as good as she gets. Bran is an enigma. At least, he is if you know virtually nothing about him. Which you really don't until you read this book. Not much is revealed about him in the Mercy books since it is strictly from Mercy's point of view and she knows little about him, too. However, since we get Bran's point of view in Cry Wolf , we learn a lot about him: his horrifying past, his love for his sons and Charles's mother, his need to protect, and why he suffers through being mated and married to Leah. That last one is probably the question I most wanted the answer to. Why on God's green earth would that man put himself through her insufferable bitchiness day in and day out? The answer to that question (No, I'm not going to tell you--read the book) makes me so sad for Bran, who very well might be my favorite character of both series. I really love that this book is in third person. I don't really like reading from first person point of view, but I will suffer through it for a series that I love, and that's why I was able to get through all the Mercy books. But, I love third person because it gives me the benefit of seeing things through the eyes of more than one person. I hate, in a book and real life, only getting one side to the story because there is always more to the situation than one person understands. So, with third person, I get to see both the hero's and heroine's perspectives. It makes the story infinitely more interesting. So! This book was amazazing and I can't wait to continue the series! Favorite Quotes: When a man is on the verge of passing out from pain, it seemed wrong to notice how beautiful he was. (Anna, page 31) *~*~* \"I hope this means you'll quit asking me to kill you.

Being an Omega means she can calm down the wolfside of a werewolf, giving peace to a species of volatile monsters, she in invaluable. But it is difficult to throw off three years of brutalization and fear and the new start isn't as smooth as she hoped, especially with a rogue werewolf killing so near the Marrock's territory. I have started this having just finished River Marked the latest in the Mercy Thompson , I really wanted to know more about Charles, Anna and Bran, the Marrock. And although at this point I am still prefering the Mercy series, I really enjoyed this book. The main attraction of this book for me after reading the novella was seeing what would happen between Charles and Anna. They are both quiet and self contained people and I loved seeing them coming together and relying eachother, it was expediated by the plot as they are both thrown in to an extreme situation, but this just made it more exciting. What I was also was relieved to see was that their relationship felt different to Mercy & Adam's, as much as I like the Mercy Thompson series I don't want to read the Alpha & Omega series if it is really just the Mercy Thompson series in disguise. It was also a nice change to see more the one POV and I got a little too excited when I read my first Bran POV! Mt crush on Bran is definitely blooming into a full blown obsession. Although by the end I did feel sorry for Leah, even though I know she is a bitch, I certainly wouldn't want to be her. Did anyone else find that? A great start and I can't wait to read more. ...more Sadly, Patricia Brigg's new series seems to be more about the romance than about the ass kicking.

I made a funny!) Not ever a really good bodice ripper. The main character -- is it telling that I can't even remember her name? -- was badly abused for three years, physically, mentally, sexually, emotionally. She was repeated raped, beaten, etc. And it seems to magically evaporate because a man with big strong shoulders rescued her. Okay, okay, there is some context for that in the book -- the wacky pack politics -- and if there had been a strong plot and characters I would have enjoyed the book. Especially since she was going to start telling us more about The Marrock. The whole structure she's created for her wolves is fascinating and I was really looking forward to learning more about wolves outside of Mercy's world. Alas, we get a slight story about a witch trying to kill some random other wolf. The whole thing is very heavily dependant upon back story that we've never heard of before. There's Asil (\"The Moor\") and his dead Omega wife and his sociopath foster daughter who has been hunting him down for 200 years in a jealous sexual rage. (Issues much?) There's the fact that The Marrock was turned by his mother (?!) and then went berserker (!!??) for however many years and his depredations were the stuff of legends (Literally: Grendel is based on this period of time!) And of course, there's every bad book's favorite device: Unholy coincidence. It just so happens that a surpassing rare Omega shows up at exactly the moment that the witch (who has some how, against all internal logic) stolen the mating bond of one of the only other Omega wolves in history. It just so happens that an Omega shows up just as The Marrock, a berserker of epic levels, is about to lose his shit. And, of course, it just so happens that she's mated (more or less against her will) to the bad-ass assassin who gets sent against the witch who just happens to be The Marrock's son. Never mind the convolutions she needs to do with her own magic system to make this farce of a plot go. That's a little too many happenstances for me. The writing itself, the prose I mean, was up to Briggs's usual competence. In the middle of a heat wave , I was chilled reading her sections on hiking in the Cabinet Mountains in winter. But apparently she's an author with just one main character in her -- Mercy -- because the first chapter from the next Mercy book stuck in the end was just fantastic! ...more Story: 4.5 Stars Narration: 2 Stars Just a quick note about the narration - the issues that I had with the novella Alpha & Omega are mostly resolved here.

Overall, I can deal with it and enjoy the story. My problem is that I got impatient and had to switch to my Kindle to actually read the book. I think this is at least, partially, due to the fact that I'm still pretty irritated with the the way the narrator chooses the characters' voices and to read the book. Another reminder, this book picks up immediately following Alpha & Omega , so it is necessary to read that first. Previous review of the story: It's hard to review a book in a series that's become a favorite. Even while re-reading this book I couldn't help but think of the overall series, and world. Implications, and realities that are learned. The first 1/3 is definitely slower than I'm used to in PB books, I think that's partly due to the fact of the beginning really starting in Alpha & Omega (the novella). I really enjoyed some of the conversations that took place there, and I like the way that Charles and Anna's relationship develop. They have a very different dynamic than Mercy and Adam, for example. Anna is a bit gun-shy (and watching her come out of that is one of the most satisfying things I've read) to start, and Charles is very unused to communicating his feelings. Anna begins to learn to read Charles, listening to more than just his words including his body language, tone, and even her nose. Charles learns who Anna is, not someone that he has to coddle and protect, but someone strong-willed enough to enjoy all he has to offer. This is an incredibly emotional book, more so on re-reads for me. The parts with Walter nearly always break my heart and choke me up. Asil too. And, of course, being obsessed with Bran, I love learning more about him. And we do get quite a bit more insight since the book takes place in Aspen Creek. Cry Wolf is an eminently satisfying read with a strong romance and plenty of outside drama. ...more Happy dance commencing.

As a victim of a sex crime myself, I'm always proud when I see heroines who overcome in the face of the horrible memories and PTSD that almost always accompany victims of these crimes. Anna is great. Watching her rebuild her self-esteem and find the bravery she lost is very satisfying. Charles is a hottie too! Although he's a powerful Alpha himself and the enforcer for the Marrok (head of the U.S. werewolves), he forces himself to temper his possessiveness and find the gentleness he thought he'd lost in order to help Anna with her issues. I enjoyed the plot. I enjoyed the dynamics between these two, and I'll be looking for another book about Anna and her Charles to see how much stronger these two will be together. Be aware that I would classify this and Briggs' other books as Urban Fantasy vice romance. There is a bit of sex, but it's not a large part of the story. ...more This story begins almost exactly where the prequel ends as Anna prepares to accompany Charles to Montana, leaving Chicago for good.
