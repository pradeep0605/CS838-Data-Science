If you have read this you will understand the above sentences, if not I'll just say, Winterson is often challenging, beautiful sentences, mixed with the frustration of trying to understand what she is trying to convey. Non linear, not at all straightforward strytelling,, fragmented thoughts and paragraphs with many side roads and detours, like reading an Ali Smith novel. Yet, put together an amazing story and a different way of telling one. Brilliant in ways, but definitely not for everyone.

So I picked this book. My initial feeling was that there couldn't be two books as diametrically opposed as Don Quixote and <+++>Lighthousekeeping</+++> . One is set in the sun-filled plains of early seventeenth-century Spain and treats of the adventures of chivalric knights and fair ladies, the other is set in mid twentieth-century Scotland among the sailors and fisherfolk of a wind-blown, cliff-perched town on a rocky coast; one is rich in words and chapters and volumes, the other as sparely written as if every word had cost a small fortune and must do the work of a hundred. Then I came to page 107 of <---A>Jeanette Winterson</---A>\u2019s book, and the phrase Only connect . Suddenly I was propelled out of the book I was reading and into other books I'd read in the past, into Forster and Woolf, and much to my surprise, right back to Cervantes. That subtle prompt had made me realise that Lighthousekeeping is full of stories just as Cervantes' great epic is full of stories, and that one of the main stories Winterson chooses to tell is none other than 'The Man Who Was Recklessly Curious', the long short story inserted into the first volume of Don Quixote . It took me a while to see the connection between the two versions but when I did, it was abundantly clear: both versions tell of men who have found love but who can't be content until their unreasonable jealousies have turned their love into loss. Both books are also divided into distinct halves, the second half, though very different from the first in each case, nevertheless expands and continues the first. Only connect . Both books are concerned with the repeated sallying forth of their heroes, towards new adventures in one, towards new beginnings in the other. And there is a certain enchantment in Lighthousekeeping after all: solid becomes liquid, silver becomes mercury, light becomes dark, Jekyll becomes Hyde. But those unexpected parallels between the two titles aren\u2019t the only coincidence around the reading of this book. If I picked up Lighthousekeeping yesterday, it's because I recently found it shelved among books I read years ago. Only connect . When I found it, I remembered why I had bought it. I had been to a book reading where Jeanette Winterson spoke about her writing and read from some of her work. One of the things she read was the first few pages of Lighthousekeeping . She explained a little of how she came to write it and spoke of the care she'd taken with word choices, that if a story is set on a rocky coast, then the imagery must be that of ships and the sea and the wind. Until I read it for myself, I could never have appreciated how beautifully she followed that plan and how well it works. This book is as petite and enchanting as the fossilized impression of a seahorse. If I could keep it in my pocket, I would. ......................................................................................... Only connect . As a result of reading this book, I must now read The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . I love when one book leads to another. ...more An extraordinary, lyrical book that is about the power of storytelling in - and about - our lives.

Other themes are light/dark/blindness (literal and metaphorical), outcasts, and the contrast between permanence and immobility (symbolised by the lighthouse) and change (people and the sea). The fictional characters (one of whom has strong parallels with Winterson - see below) have some interaction with real characters and their works (Darwin, Robert Louis Stevenson and Wagner), and a broadly realistic story is sprinkled with slightly fairytale-like qualities, especially at the start, which also has comical aspects! Yet somehow, Winterson conjures this odd medley into something coherent, beautiful and profound. PLOT There are two main narrative strands, both set in the small and remote Scottish village of Salts, and its lighthouse: mysterious Victorian priest, Babel Dark, and Silver, a girl orphaned in 1969. Silver is the narrator, and the opening chapters reminded me of a Roald Dahl's children's story: she and her shamed mother live outside the village, in a house cut into the hill such that it has a sloping floor, furniture has to be nailed down, they can only \"eat food that stuck to the plate\", and their dog has developed back legs shorter than the front. A tragi-comic accident leaves Silver an orphan. After a short spell with a Dahlian spinster, she goes to live with Pew the blind lighthousekeeper, and the book loses the comedy, but retains some magic. \"Some of the light went out of me, it seemed proper that I should go and live in a place where all the light shone outwards.\" NARRATIVE STRUCTURE, STORIES, STORYTELLING Don't expect a single, linear narrative of a consistent style. \"A beginning, a middle and an end is the proper way to tell a story. But I have difficulty with that method.\" It doesn't matter because \"The continuous narrative of existence is a lie... there are lit-up moments, and the rest is dark.\" Pew is a master storyteller, and Silver weaves his stories into the one she is telling. The boundaries of fact and fiction are often blurred within her world (as in this book itself, with its mention of real historical figures): Pew will describe doing something that happened before he was born, and when challenged, dismisses it as his second sight or \"well, the Pew that was born then\", whilst retaining the suggestion that in some mysterious way it was actually him. Perhaps part of the reasons for Silver's blending of fact and fiction was prompted by this: a psychiatrist defines psychosis as being out of touch with reality, and her response is \"Since then, I have been trying to find out what reality is, so that I can touch it.\" The musings on stories are the most lyrical and magical aspects, and suggest the tangled ways in which they thread through our lives. \"In fairy stories, naming is knowledge\" and that is reflected in this story in several key ways. Most stories never finish, \"There was an ending - there always is - but the story went on past the ending - it always does\". Similarly, \"There's no story that's the start of itself, any more than a child comes into the world without parents.\" \"All the stories must be told... Maybe all stories are worth hearing, but not all stories are worth telling... The stories themselves make the meaning.\" If you had forty minutes to tell your life story, what would you say? (This isn't a long book, but there's more than forty minutes' worth.) The final chapters are more overtly philosophical, with less actual story. I think they're none the worse for that, but some may be disconcerted by the chane. SILVER AS WINTERSON? Winterson's first book, Oranges are Not the Only Fruit ( https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ), was explicitly a fictionalised version of her childhood, and recently, she published the more factual \"Why be Happy when you Could be Normal?\" ( https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ), but there are many aspects of Winterson in this as well: an orphan born in 1959, who finds solace in stories and libraries, \"had to grow up on my own\", and forges her own life. Some of the problems Silver encounters in later life also echo Winterson's own (view spoiler) [(e.g. consultations with mental health professionals) (hide spoiler) ] . She also finds the positive in the hardest circumstances, \"We are lucky, even the worst of us, because daylight comes\" (in \"Why be Happy\", she is grateful that the church taught her how important it is to concentrate on good things). It goes further: the beloved mother in this \"longed for me to be free, and did everything she could to make sure it never happened\", and in \"Why be happy\", she makes an identical observation about the awful Mrs W (quoted in my review, linked above). WEAKNESSES For such a carefully crafted book, it is a little heavy-handed at times. These are rare, minor faults in the overall context and content, and are recorded here more for my personal records than to spoil it for anyone else, hence the spoiler tag. (view spoiler) [In particular, the names Dark and Lux are as subtle as a sledgehammer. Also, the symbolism of the lighthouse is occasionally spelt out more than it needs to be: a birth coinciding with completion of this phallic symbol, and a passage, \"He was like this lighthouse... He was lonely and aloof... The instruments were in place... but the light was not lit.\" (hide spoiler) ] QUOTATIONS AND NEW IDIOMS * \"A silent, taciturn clamp of a man.\" * \"She was one of those people for whom yes is always an admission of guilt or failure.

The problem I had with the novel is that it felt that there were several stories going on here, none of which were ever fully fleshed out or made real to me. I greatly enjoyed reading it, but when I finished I didn't feel like I had read a full novel; instead, it felt more like a series of vignettes waiting to be fleshed out. I read Lighthousekeeping thanks to a recommendation of an editor I met some time ago and I still remember when she said to me: you have to read this book because it has something special that I know you'll appreciate.

The book was almost like a love at first sight, in which each of the pages dragged me like a giant octopus into the depths of this gentle character, innocent and yet strangely unsettling. Lighthouse keeping is an unpretentious novel but full of a subtle narrative and deep characters had made that this book becomes one of my favorite ones. I recommend it to all those readers who like diving into simple stories, almost like a fairy tale, but full of subtleties, fuzzy feelings, and subtle thoughts. For me, it's a little gem of the contemporary literature. Spanish version: Le\u00ed la ni\u00f1a del faro gracias a la recomendaci\u00f3n de una editora que conoc\u00ed hace tiempo.

I enjoyed the blend for the first three quarters of the book but seemed to drift off at the end. Still, she\u2019s a 4\u2605 read. 10-year-old Silver and her single mum live in a house on a hillside so steep that they sleep in hammocks and eat food that will stick to the plate (peas roll away forever), and they tie themselves together to get up to the house. When Silver is orphaned, she is fostered out in the tiny village of Salts to Pew, a blind lighthouse keeper. Yes, blind. But he says to her once, \u201cYou have the handicap of sight, it\u2019s true. . . . Never rely on what you can see. Not everything can be seen.\u201d She falls in love with Pew\u2019s stories, with books and the library, which she\u2019s not allowed to join. She is so frustrated at borrowers checking out books she\u2019s only started, that she finally steals one. Alongside this story, we follow the tale of Babel Dark, a philandering preacher in Salts in the 1800s who, much to the delight of Charles Darwin , discovers fossils high on the seaside cliffs, evidence that supports Darwin\u2019s The Origin of Species , leading to fame for the village. Robert Louis Stevenson , the famous author ( Treasure Island , and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ) was the grandson of Robert Stevenson who built this and other lighthouses, which opens up discussion about lighthouses and the nature of man - the light and the dark. On the whole, a mystifying, thought-provoking book.. P.S. An example of her style from near the end, in Silver\u2019s adulthood: The boat was vacuum-packed with Albanians, four generations to a family: great-grandmother, air-dried like a chilli pepper, deep red skin and a hot temper; grandmother, all sun-dried tomato, tough, chewy, skin split with the heat; getting the kids to rub olive oil into her arms; mother, moist as a purple fig, open everywhere \u2013 blouse, skirt, mouth, eyes, a wide-open woman, lips licking the salt spray flying from the open boat.

They were his thoughts. he wouldn't tell anyone, ever. Do you know the story of Jekyll and Hyde? Of course. Well then \u2013 to avoid either extreme, it is necessary to find all the lives in between. Are we so utterly lacking in self-knowledge do you think? I wouldn\u2019t put it like that, Dark: a man may know himself, but he prides himself on his character, his integrity \u2013 the word says it all \u2013 integrity \u2013 we use to mean virtue, but it means wholeness too, and which of us is that? This is not a love story, but love is in it. That is, loves is just outside it, looking for a way to break in. We\u2019re here, there,, not here, not there, swirling like specks of dust, claiming for ourselves the rights of the universe. Being important, being nothing, being caught in lives of our own making that we never wanted. Breaking out, trying again, wondering why the past comes with us, wondering how to talk about the past at all. There\u2019s a booth in Grand Central Station where you can go and record your life. You talk. It tapes. It\u2019s the modern-day confessional \u2013 no priest, just your voice in the silence. What you were, digitally saved for the future. Forty minutes is yours. Now the sky was a dead sea, and the stars and the planets were memory-points, like Darwin\u2019s fossils. There were archives of catastrophe and mistake. The fossil record is always there, whether or not you discover it. The brittle ghosts of the past. Memory is not like the surface of the water \u2013 either troubled or still. Memory is layered. What you were was another life, but the evidence is somewhere in the rock \u2013 your trilobites and ammonites, your struggling life-forms, just when you thought you could stand upright. Before he wrote on the origin of Species, Darwin spent five years as a naturalist, aboard HMS Beagle. In nature he found not past, present and future as we recognise them, but an evolutionary process of change \u2013 energy never rapped for too long \u2013 life always changing. Darwin said something to me once for which I was grateful. I had been trying to forget, trying to stop my mind reaching for a place where it can never home. He knew my agitation, though he did not know the cause, and he took me up to (Am Parbh) \u2013 the Turning point. Nothing can be forgotten. Nothing can be lost. The universe itself is one vast memory system. Look back and you will find the beginnings of the world. I wish I could be clearer, I wish I could say \u201c My life has no light. My life was eating me alive\u201d The rest of my life. I have never rested always run, run so fast that the sun can\u2019t make a shadow. Well, here I am \u2013 mid-way, lost in a dark wood \u2013 the selva oscura without a torch, a guide, or even a bird. In 1859 Darwin published on the Origin of the Species. Wagner completed the opera Tristan and Isolde. Both are about the beginnings of the world. In Tristan the world shrinks to a boat, a bed, a lantern, a love-potion, a wound. The world is contained within a word \u2013 Isold. The Romantic solipsism that nothing exists but the two of us, could not be further from the multiplicity and variety of Darwin\u2019s theory of the natural world. Here, the world and everything in it forms and is re-formed tirelessly and unceasingly. Nature\u2019s vitality is amoral and unsenti-mental: the weak die, the strong survive. In the fossil record of our existence, there is no trace of love. You cannot find it held in the earth\u2019s crust, waiting to be discovered. The long bones of our ancestors show nothing of their hearts. There last meal is sometimes preserved n peat or in ice, but their thoughts and feelings are gone. Some wounds never heal. The second time the sword went in, I aimed it at the place of the first. I am weak there \u2013 the place where I had been found out before. My weakness was skinned over by your love. I knew when you healed me that the wound would open again. I knew it like destiny, and at the same time, I knew it as choice. The love-potion? I never drank it? Did you? I unlatched the shutters. The light was as intense as a love affair. I was blinded, delighted, not just because it was warm and wonderful, but because nature measures nothing. Nobody needs this much sunlight. Nobody needs droughts, volcanoes, monsoons, tornadoes either, but we get them, because our world is as extravagant as a world can be. We are the ones obsessed by measurement. The world just pours it out. I used to be a hopeless romantic. I am still a hopeless romantic. I used to believe that love was the highest value. I still believe that love is the highest value. I don\u2019t expect to be happy. I don\u2019t imagine that I will find love, whatever that means, or that if I do find it, it will make me happy. I don\u2019t think of love as the answer or the solution.I don\u2019t think of love as the a force of nature \u2013 as strong as the sun, as necessary, as impersonal, as gigantic, as impossible, as scorching as it is warming, as drought making as it I life giving. And when it burns out, the planet dies. My little orbit of life circles love. I daren\u2019t get any closer. I\u2019m not a mystic seeking final communion. I don\u2019t go out with SPF5. I protect myself. ...more After having finished \"Lighthousekeeping\" which I've had recommended to me by several friends, I'm left with an overall impression of vague disappointment.

However, whenever I sit down to read a novel I want to be told a story that drags me in. Beautiful writing is always a plus, but not when the story becomes too messy and intricate, and I felt like that was the case with \"Lighthousekeeping\". In this novel, we are taken back and forth between several lives and destinies which all entertwine, but to be honest I was most interested in reading about the protagonist Silver and I unfortunately didn't get as many pages on her as I was hoping for. This novel has definitely intrigued me to read more by Jeanette Winterson. It's unique, and it deals with some interesting topics such as loss, memory and identity. I quite liked this novel (hence my 3-star-rating), I just didn't love it as much as I was hoping for, but I hope that'll be the case with one of her other books I'm going to read. ...more I know - I'm \"currently reading\" 3 books already.

I started feeling a little breathless and mesmerized and swirly eyed and moved on to the next short section.

I'm not sure how I'll pace myself between this book, Shadow Country, the Total Immersion swimming book and the Chi running book (which I haven't touched in so long I'm not sure where it is). But I know which one of this reading stack will make me get that calm little smile of pleasure when I'm reading it. Review: I have zigged and zagged about this book: It\u2019s a story within a story within a story. It\u2019s about the power of stories. It\u2019s a fable. It\u2019s poetry. It\u2019s about light and dark. It\u2019s about Jekyll and Hyde. It\u2019s about Pirates and Silver. But finally I have to say it is what it is. It\u2019s whatever you get from it. You can just sit back and enjoy the language and the salty, fuzzy images Winterson creates for you: Railings Row is a terrace of houses set back from the road. They reared up, black-bricked and salt-stained, their paint peeling, their brass green. Or you can appreciate the subtle humor in the dialog between Pew and Silver: Miss Pinch says you came from the orphanage in Glasgow. There\u2019s always been a Pew at Cape Wrath. But not the same Pew. Well, well. You can count the references to the dark and light, good and bad, this and that, here and there, then and now \u2013 and get a rather large number. You can furrow your brow and wonder when the heck the story took place since there are both references to lighthouse keepers and Starbucks coffee. Or you can just enjoy Lighthousekeeping like you would a painting or a nature walk or a lovely Pinot Noir from the Oregon coast. And that\u2019s what I finally settled into. ...more If you've never read any Winterson before, this might be a good place to start, even though it's one of her most recent books.

The novel encompasses several stories, opening with the tale of orphaned Silver, who is sent off to live with an old blind man named Pew in a lighthouse on the coast of northwest Scotland. Pew tells Silver different tales while he teaches her how to tend the lighthouse. The foremost story he tells is of the preacher Babel Dark, a tormented man who may have been the inspiration for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The novel has many twists and turns, and the story of Silver and the story of Dark become intertwined, with a surprising bit of the Tristan and Isolde story thrown in at the end to further illuminate Winterson's overall theme of love and relationships. This is one of the most unique novels I've read in a long time, and if you like Modernist literature, you will probably enjoy this book. If you prefer straightforward narrative, then this is probably not the book for you. ...more I loved this book - perhaps because it came at a time when my head was very busy with other stuff. It's a breath of salted air in your lungs. If you like nice linear, predictable books with a defined structure, then this one is not for you. But if you're happy to be wound in the seaweed curls of Winterson's prose poetry then this book is a delight. The version I read (the Kindle edition) also has some excellent interviews with the author, which are inspiring and really help to understand how she I loved this book - perhaps because it came at a time when my head was very busy with other stuff.

The version I read (the Kindle edition) also has some excellent interviews with the author, which are inspiring and really help to understand how she writes. In these days when the 'write every day whether you feel like it or not' philosophy is in vogue, it is really refreshing to hear a writer talking about how her best writing comes from the unconsious, and that you need to give that time and space to develop - it can't be pushed into a regime. Highly recommended. ...more Without a doubt, Jeanette Winterson is one of the finest writers of contemporary literary fiction. \u201cLighthousekeeping\u201d is a story about a young orphan girl taken in be a blind and mysterious lighthouse keeper who tells stories about a 19th century clergyman who leads a double life: \u201ca public one mired in darkness and deceit, and a private one bathed in the light of passionate love.\u201d As I write in my own novel, \u201cThe Reality of Being Lovers,\u201d \u201cLighthousekeeping\u201d is a love story, but you don\u2019t know Without a doubt, Jeanette Winterson is one of the finest writers of contemporary literary fiction. \u201cLighthousekeeping\u201d is a story about a young orphan girl taken in be a blind and mysterious lighthouse keeper who tells stories about a 19th century clergyman who leads a double life: \u201ca public one mired in darkness and deceit, and a private one bathed in the light of passionate love.\u201d As I write in my own novel, \u201cThe Reality of Being Lovers,\u201d \u201cLighthousekeeping\u201d is a love story, but you don\u2019t know that until the end. ...more \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03c1\u03c9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf. \u0397 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b5\u03ba\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5. \u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc. \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1 \u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2. \u0393\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b7, \u03be\u03b5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 : -

But then I worried that it was too lovely, too tidy in its thumping end-lines. What saves it is its scattered form. This book has to be scraps and fragments to offset its pristine, shapely sentences. Winterson is an astonishing story-teller, so much so that I grew annoyed when she drifted into ideas and meta-story (what does it mean anyway to tell a story?). But her ideas are so damn good that they are all I am thinking about. Here's an idea: \"Some people say that the best stories have no words. They weren\u2019t brought up to Lighthousekeeping. It is true that words drop away, and that the important things are often left unsaid. The important things are learned in faces, in gestures, not in our locked tongues. The true things are too big or too small, or in any case always the wrong size to fit the template called language. \"I know that. But I know something else too, because I was brought up to Lighthousekeeping. Turn down the daily noise and at first there is the relief of silence. And then, very quietly, as quiet as light, meaning returns. Words are the part of silence that can be spoken.\" Also, I haven't read such a rich dive into the disjointed psyche since The Golden Notebook . Like this conversation between the narrator and a psychoanalyst: \u201cdo you keep one record of your life, or several? Do you feel you have more than one life perhaps?\u201d \u201cOf course I do. It would be impossible to tell one single story.\u201d \u201cPerhaps you should try.\u201d \u201cA beginning, a middle, and an end?\u201d \u201cSomething like that -- yes.\u201d I thought of Babel Dark and his neat brown notebooks, and his wild torn folder. I thought of Pew tearing stories out of light. \u201cDo you know the story of Jekyll and Hyde?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cWell then -- to avoid either extreme, it is necessary to find all the lives in between.\u201d ...more Ahora s\u00ed, Winterson.

Tierna, evocadora e imbuida de una atm\u00f3sfera brumosa, La ni\u00f1a del faro me ha parecido una lectura singular y muy recomendable. ...more The book is about love.

The more that the novella was in the world of Silver's childhood, filled with stories, the more it satisfied me; I'm not sure that I was as moved by her love affair in adulthood. Granted, that love is the culmination of the novel; Winterson makes an argument for intimacy, sensuality, and connection as the redemptive qualities within the brevity of human life. But it felt more abstract--even with the gorgeous sensuous passages that Winterson is known for--than did the salty, sea-tossed world of imaginary Scotland where Winterson sets the stories of Silver's childhood. I like the central image of a lighthouse as a beacon for human lives, a beacon that becomes inseparable from the stories that are woven about it. Winterson retells The Scarlet Letter in her Babel Dark (think Reverend Dimmesdale) who chooses resentment and jealousy and later caution and isolation over passion and love. She also emphasizes the crashing uncertainty introduced by modernity, represented in her text by Darwin and Wagner, Jekyll and Hyde. This sea change (I can't help it, the book begs for nautical metaphors) unsettles Babel Dark who wants an orderly world (even if his very name betokens the lack of one). The novella feels like a manifesto for a different kind of postmodern writing, one less characterized by black humor and pastiche and more accepting of the tides and waves of story that make a human life a fractured if luminous succession (indeed, concatenation--since it's more simultaneous than sequential) of significance. I can see why some readers were dissatisfied with the book; it goes in many tonal directions, begins many stories that it does not quite end (the novella openly declares its refusal of endings, saying they are not true to life). But some are just wonderfully evocative. (Like Silver stealing a parrot because it hails her with her name.) A short, bizarre, and for me, quite touching read. ...more Hands down, my favorite book by Winterson. The prose is so beautiful it made me giddy. The first lines in the book say it all: \"My mother called me Silver. I was born part precious metal part pirate. I have no father.\" The entire book reads like narrative poetry, but what I like best is it ends with love. That's my kind of HEA (Happily Ever After). The book is a story within a story.

I have no father.\" The entire book reads like narrative poetry, but what I like best is it ends with love. That's my kind of HEA (Happily Ever After). The book is a story within a story. The first tale is about Silver, living in a lighthouse with the enigmatic keeper of the lighthouse, Pew. He tells Silver stories of Babel Dark (awesome name), a clergyman living a double life. In one town, he is a cold and cruel husband. In another town, he's a gentle family man. Dark teaches her about life as she grows up and learns how to love. Winterson tends to finish her stories with open-endings, slanted by optimism. I love her for that. I love her for a lot of things, but this book in particular best illustrates the beauty and twisted nature of love, how we decide to treat each other in relationships, and that it's never too late to tell someone you love them. This is a book for stunning prose and the philosophy of love, not for plot, yet it's still page-turner for me. ...more The story comes together from different segments of characters' lives. I want to read more of Winterson's writings. What a lovely & beautiful book. I think Pew has entered my list of favorite book characters. Highly recommended. This is the first book of Jeanette Winterson's I've read, and while I enjoyed it, I found, more often than not, that I was devouring her language rather than the story itself. It's actually two stories woven together-- the story of the lead character, Silver and the history of Babel Dark, a notorious figure from her seaside town. I preferred the beginning of the book to its conclusion, which isn't unusual for me-- I could have easily read a 400-page novel just on Silver and Pew and done away wit This is the first book of Jeanette Winterson's I've read, and while I enjoyed it, I found, more often than not, that I was devouring her language rather than the story itself.

I preferred the beginning of the book to its conclusion, which isn't unusual for me-- I could have easily read a 400-page novel just on Silver and Pew and done away with the growing-up-bits. Again, not unusual, and it hardly reflects on the book itself, which is a startlingly beautifully-told tale with several ribbons of story winding together, for the most part, seamlessly. Her relentlessly gorgeous language and the stark, sepia-tone feel of the setting leaves you unprepared for her hyperbole, which begins right off the bat and is by turns hysterically funny or tongue-in-cheek, and every bit as lyrical as the rest. I had been hoping the book would go in a different direction than it did, namely into Silver's possible future keeping the light on her own, but alas, that was not the way the story went. And this is primarily a novel about stories; their importance and the unusual paths they take. I'll definitely have my eye out for another Jeanette Winterson book-- this was just the thing to curl up with during a snowstorm, which is precisely what I did. ...more \"A beginning, a middle and an end is the proper way to tell a story. But I have difficulty with that method.\" Winterson was right to this line. Time is a huge factor in the story, and Winterson has always confessed that she has no sense of it (also same as to Sexing the Cherry). The story follows the life of Silver, a young girl orphaned by the death of her mother, her only parent, and was taken in by Pew, the keeper of the town's lighthouse.

The story follows the life of Silver, a young girl orphaned by the death of her mother, her only parent, and was taken in by Pew, the keeper of the town's lighthouse. The story is beguiling in its own cryptic ways, heightened by Winterson's masterful use of poetry and symbolism. The only thing that I didn't like much about this book is that sometimes it felt like too much was going on. A sub-plot to the main plot gives depth to the story, but there were many other stories beneath those sub-plots that, I feel, could have been uncalled for. The narration was a bit of an issue for me, as well. For a rather short novel timeframed at twenty years, the point-of-view switched so often and so drastically that at times it was difficult to tell where the story was now at. However, for a writing like Winterson's, filled to the brim with poetic stanzas that stirs you from the inside, these issues are but a small patch in a meadow. After all, a book like Lighthousekeeping is not the kind you read to get to the end--it is the kind you weep for when it does end. You wish you can feed on its words longer because it fills you up, in a way a lover of words want to be filled, and for a moment, you feel truly satisfied. ...more LIGHTHOUSEKEEPING was my return to Winterson's writing after a long absence. This novel is uneven, but the better parts clearly demonstrate Winterson's considerable strengths as a writer: hauntingly poetic prose, mesmerizing in its rhythms, and a deployment of language that is rich, deft, nuanced, but never ostentatious. Winterson's themes (across her whole body of work) don't run broadly, but they run deep: the perils attendant upon how we construct our identities; what really matters in life a LIGHTHOUSEKEEPING was my return to Winterson's writing after a long absence.

Winterson's themes (across her whole body of work) don't run broadly, but they run deep: the perils attendant upon how we construct our identities; what really matters in life and how we define and protect those things; love, loneliness, and abandonment; the thin line between truth and lies; and, most of all, the absolute necessity of storytelling for the human experience to have meaning. This novel's ideas, symbols, parables, and clever use of historical fact (from Charles Darwin to Robert Louis Stevenson to the history of lighthouses) keep the reader musing for days afterwards, but the attempts to bring the rich fictional fabric into the present day, and the occasional feeling that autobiography is forcing its way in a little too assertively, prevent the the novel from rising to the heights of Winterson's masterpiece, THE PASSION. ...more Jeanette Winterson came to Chicago during the tour of this book. It was a very exciting reading that I will never forget. I brought my books to be signed by her and she was very gracious and quite personable when it was my turn to speak to her.

This is a very good book about love, loss and the ties that bind. Friends are the family we choose for ourselves, and sometimes that family becomes more meaningful than the ones that we are stuck with. I would certainly recommend this book to new readers of Winterson as well as seasoned readers. ...more This book didn't start out as well as Sexing the Cherry, but by the end of it, I loved it. So, not as strong, but still wonderful. Just be patient. Both of these books are animated by Winterson's notions of the complexity of what we call reality, of the depth of what lies beneath the surface of time and the possibility that some of it isn't as deeply buried as we think.

I love reading about other people being as confused about reality as I am, even if they're just characters. It's reassuring. I'm not so sure confusion is the right word for it, of course.... ...more God, I love Winterson so much. Literally every sentence she writes is quotable. This book careens out of prose and into poetry most of the time; even when it doesn't, it's still beautiful. It is not a standard narrative; as such, it has no real plot in the traditional sense. Rather, it's a series of vignettes, really, in the life of the main character, Silver.
