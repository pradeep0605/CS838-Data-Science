Apple launched it's Macintosh computer for the masses, two astronauts walked the stars like gods, and singer Marvin Gaye, who sang about how sweet it was to be loved, was shot through the heart and killed by his father . Fielding Bliss's father invited the devil to town. Fielding is thirteen at the time and his attorney father Autopsy (<---B>yes that is his name</---B>) is down after a case he was trying turned out to be something totally different than what he thought it was. Dear Mr. Devil, Sir Satan, Lord Lucifer, and all other crosses you bear, I cordially invited you to Breathed, Ohio. Land of hills and hay bales, of sinners and forgivers. May you come in peace. With great faith, Autopsy Bliss The thing is? The devil does come to town. Along with the heat. A thirteen year old black child with the oddest green eyes shows up in answer to Autopsy's letter. Claiming to be the devil himself. The sheriff thinks he is just a missing boy and starts trying to find out where he is from but can't find any family looking for him. Sal is completely not what Fielding nor his father were picturing when they thought of as the devil. If the devil was going to come, I expected to see the myth of him. A demon with an asphalt shine. He'd be fury. A chill. A bad cough. Cujo at the car window, a ticket at the Creepshow booth, a leap into the depth of night. Who knew how much a thirteen year old boy could change a town in the course of a summer? Sal is taken in by Fielding's family and becomes like a son to the family. The boys become pests to their older brother Grand and best buddies to each other. But you have the town. Who is stifling under the heat and hatred is burning. Sal's wisdom is much older than his age and it seems like trouble follows him no matter what he does. \"You can tell a lot about a man by what he does with a snake. A snake that could harm you, you don't have much choice to kill. You wouldn't be able to leave a cobra in your sock drawer. But a snake that is no threat will greatly define the man who decides to kill it anyways.\" This book is so well written. You can tell that I liked it by the number of quotes I stole and put on here! Be in the mood to read it though, because it gets in your head and then you start thinking and stuff and it hurts my head to think about stuff. \"You can imagine anything you want in the dark. You can imagine your father loves you, you can imagine your mother is not disappointed, you can imagine that you are...significant. That you mean somethin' to someone. That's all I ever wanted, Fielding. To matter. That is all I've ever wanted.\" Booksource: Netgalley in exchange for review None of my friends have read this book yet...they should.

The year he became friends with the devil. Sal seems to appear out of nowhere \u2013 a bruised and tattered thirteen-year-old boy claiming to be the devil himself answering an invitation. Fielding Bliss, the son of a local prosecutor, brings him home where he\u2019s welcomed into the Bliss family, assuming he\u2019s a runaway from a nearby farm town. When word spreads that the devil has come to Breathed, not everyone is happy to welcome this self-proclaimed fallen angel. Murmurs follow him and tensions rise, along with the temperatures as an unbearable heat wave rolls into town right along with him. As strange accidents start to occur, riled by the feverish heat, some in the town start to believe that Sal is exactly who he claims to be. While the Bliss family wrestles with their own personal demons, a fanatic drives the town to the brink of a catastrophe that will change this sleepy Ohio backwater forever. I think something deep in my soul has shifted after reading this book. My gut is still churning after turning the final page 2 days ago, and its been years since a book brought me to the brink of tears. I read more psychological thrillers and dark fiction than one human likely should, yet none of that seemed as horrific as what I just read. Don\u2019t misunderstand- this isn\u2019t some bloodbath horror tale with cheesy specters of the devil and his minions. The only apparition in this story is a 13 year old boy, but back to that in a minute. \u201cThe heat came with the devil. It was the summer of 1984, and while the devil had been invited, the heat was not. It should\u2019ve been expected, though. Heat is, after all, the devil\u2019s name, and when\u2019s the last time you left home without yours?\u201d Just like the blurb states, the setting is summer of 1984, and the book describes what was going on in the media during this time. I really loved all the small details she took the time to include; this seemed to put the level of writing over the top for me. Autopsy Bliss (yep, his real name), father to Fielding Bliss (our narrator), has placed an ad in the local paper inviting the devil to town. The reasoning behind this is explained in the final pages of our story, so you do get all kinds of closure, but the story starts out making you scratch your head and wonder \u201cwhere is this lady going to take us with this?\u201d. Yes, then a 13 year old black boy with green eyes shows up holding said ad claiming to be the devil, but this book is not what you\u2019re thinking it is. I admit, I saw my friend Shelby\u2019s review and my curiosity was piqued, but I was already overloaded with NetGalley books so I figured I\u2019d catch it some time after publication. Thankfully the author contacted me and convinced me to read it now! Fact: Chelsea never re-reads books. Fact: Chelsea is going to have to re-read this book sometime in the future. \u201cYou can tell a lot about a man by what he does with a snake\u2026 A snake that could harm you, you don\u2019t have much choice to kill. You wouldn\u2019t be able to leave a cobra in your sock drawer. But a snake that is no threat will greatly define the man who decides to kill it anyways.\u201d The characters are what really sold me on this story. Each one was deep, flawed, and broken in their own ways, yet still lovable as I felt attached to each member of the Bliss family, including Sal. We get to see snippets of Fielding\u2019s life as he ages from memories he shares with us as a man in his 80\u2019s. We know early on that something major will happen at the end of the summer of \u201984, and the tension grows in a slow, yet powerful way. Each chapter brought new revelations on the character\u2019s personal struggles, as well as the impending doom that lingers over the entire town of Breathed. This story was crafted with so many real issues that were relevant then and are still relevant now- mob mentality, racism, homophobia, and the ever failing criminal justice system. The ending was nothing short of disturbing, mainly because it is so easily pictured and believable. I was completely shocked with all aspects of the ending; I did not see one thing coming with how this story concluded and it made me feel this weird cross between horrified and satisfied. I don\u2019t want to put any spoilers in here, but I felt I had grown close to this family and was broken with them every step of the way. This is a must read that is deep, compelling, and timely for what is consuming our state of current affairs. My heart broke and wept openly as a reader, as a mother, and simply as a human being. PLEASE read this book; it will certainly be a pick in my round up for TOP 10 books I\u2019ve read this year. *Many thanks to author Tiffany McDaniel and St. Martin\u2019s Press for providing my copy via NetGalley in exchange for an honest and fair review.

If you preorder the book you can sign up here Tiffany McDaniel's Preorder Contest to win some cool stuff including a signed print of this watercolor. The heat wave that hit Breathed, Ohio, in 1984 was no ordinary hot spell. It was oppressive and inescapable. It was as if the cellar door to hell had been laid open beneath their feet. Sweat dripped from their pores like the tears of the damned. Tempers flared under the constant, ruthless lash of unbearable high temperatures. Reason floated away into the atmosphere and was replaced by superstition and irrationality. And it was all Autopsy Bliss\u2019s fault. He did write the letter, after all. \u201dDear Mr. Devil, Sir Satan, Lord Lucifer, and all other crosses you bear, I cordially invite you to Breathed, Ohio. Land of hills and hay bales, of sinners and forgivers. May you come in peace. With great faith, Autopsy Bliss\u201d The Devil accepted. Now Autopsy Bliss is an educated man, a lawyer in fact, but he got bit by the fire and brimstone of religion. When he issued this letter to the newspaper, did he really expect the Devil to appear before him? Did he think he could wrestle Lucifer or spar with Satan, and The Cross would assure him a fair fight? I don\u2019t think that Autopsy Bliss expected a creature with cloven hooves, forked tail, and horns to appear on his doorstep. Lucifer is a fallen angel, not a demon, and certainly not the creature of fairytale, or the fiendish incarnation he has been depicted in films, or the lurid spectacle he has become on the covers of pulp novels. It turns out he is a thirteen year old black boy with green eyes. He was, in fact, the same age as Fielding Bliss. He calls himself Sal. \u201dIf looks were to be believed, he still was just a boy. Something of my age, though from his solemn quietude, I knew he was old in the soul. A boy whose black crayon would be the shortest in his box.\u201d Autopsy might have had a more realistic vision of Satan in his mind than the cartoon version, but it still took some mental gymnastics to even begin to believe that Sal was the Devil. The heat has eroded minds. Logic is a bonfire. Familiar perceptions are a blaze. When things start to go wrong for people, they start to believe that the implausible is suddenly the only possible explanation. Fielding\u2019s mother Stella hasn\u2019t left the house in twelve years. When she withdrew from the world, she decided to bring the world to her by turning each room of her house into a different country. Grand is Fielding\u2019s older brother, a young man on the cusp of the rest of his life. He is a God of the ballfield, but also a man of character and sensitivity that makes him so much more than just the sum of his parts. Fielding worships him, as he should. Grand is someone we can all aspire to be more like. He is a worthy sacrifice. \u201dA summer\u2019s day, and with the setting sun Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star\u201d ---Milton, Paradise Lost It is one thing to never find paradise, but of course it is quite another thing to have found it and lost it. For a family named Bliss, they have watched the gates of Eden shimmer behind them and disappear. Sal becomes the third son. I think what the people of Breathed forgot about was that the concept of the Devil is manifested in all of us. You might not see him when you look in the mirror dead on, but turn your head to the side and look out of the corner of your eye, and you might catch a glimpse of him. He is reflected in your fingernails when the light is just right. Sometimes, if you close your eyes down to slits, you can see him in the swirls of your pancake. He stares at us from the darkness, from the bowel of a tree, or through the eyes of an owl. You can\u2019t kill him. You can\u2019t kill the light that has fallen to darkness. Why would God let you? \u201dPeople always ask, Why does God allow suffering? Why does He allow a child to be beaten? A woman to cry? A holocaust to happen? A good dog to die painfully? Simple truth is, He wants to see for Himself what we\u2019ll do. He\u2019s stood up the candle, put the devil at the wick, and now He wants to see if we blow it out or let it burn down. God is suffering\u2019s biggest spectator.\u201d The town begins to suffer from mass insanity. Call it the heat, but there is this dark desire in too many of us that rises to the surface, unchecked, when we are challenged. Tiffany McDaniel might be a young writer, but this is no raw first novel. She is wise with bone deep perceptions of who we are and who we become when we allow hysteria or religious fervor to dictate our actions. She writes with conviction and complexity that forced this reader to reread sentences and paragraphs to better appreciate the uniquely, creative ways she composes her thoughts. The setting is in the North, but some of the Southern Gothic of the deep South leaped over the Mason-Dixon line into Ohio. I also could swear I witnessed the ghost of Douglas Spaulding running through the woods with Fielding Bliss and saw the flash of his bare feet as he dived back into the pages of Dandelion Wine . I thought I saw Shirley Jackson lost in the loose limbs of the mob...her eyes as big as dinner plates and her mouth opened in a.... \u201dThat was when the screaming started. They were screaming cheers, we were screaming tears, and Sal was screaming fear. A rhyme of the ages.\u201d Who among us can stop them? Who can wiggle a screwdriver between the door and the jam and let the cooling balm of reason flood the hallways of a fevered mind? The author and NetGalley provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Tiffany McDaniel was gracious enough to agree to answer a few of my questions about the novel. Below is a short interview I conducted with her. Tiffany McDaniel Jeffrey Keeten: As I was reading your book I couldn't help thinking about Dandelion Wine . Have I been out in the heat too long or am I right about this book being somewhat of a homage to the Ray Bradbury book? Tiffany McDaniel: I love Ray Bradbury\u2019s Dandelion Wine , so I\u2019m beyond thrilled that you\u2019ve brought it up. I always say I want to be buried with the novel, have it in the clutches of my ghost to carry forth in to the great beyond. Having read it many times, I\u2019ve always wanted to write a story about boys coming-of-age in the summertime. Those two events seem to parallel one another as if summer exists in childhood itself. On the surface Dandelion Wine is about boys coming-of-age, but what Bradbury does so well is threading that melancholic undertone through his verse, his own bittersweet brand that makes his stories and his story-telling the mark of a true master. Life and death, happiness and sadness, these are the things that permeate both Bradbury\u2019s novel and my own. No one can ever surpass Bradbury\u2019s beautiful writing and story, but perhaps my story is a way of recognizing the beautiful force that has been Dandelion Wine in my life. Jeffrey Keeten: Paradise Lost obviously had a heavy influence on the writing of this book. You certainly have left me thinking I need to schedule a reread of PL. You also mentioned Orwell's 1984 in the book. In thinking about the scope of this book what other books would you say had a heavy influence in the creation of this book? Tiffany McDaniel: I first read Milton\u2019s epic poem when I was in my early twenties. I was immediately drawn to it because it\u2019s about that which has always fascinated me. The fall from grace. The very thing that is said to have cast all the curses upon us as human beings, and put the sins within reach. I always title my chapters in my novels, and when I was thinking of the chapter titles for <+++>The Summer that Melted Everything</+++>, \u201cParadise Lost\u201d immediately came to mind. How could it not be the perfect partner for this summer? Though I do hope I have made Milton proud by including his beautiful quotes, quotes which do outshine my own words by a billion, sparkling miles. As far as Orwell\u2019s 1984, it\u2019s one of those required readings that most everybody has in school. I was so fascinated by it, if only because the year 1984 has passed already, but also because it was a novel predicting a certain state of affairs where citizens are manipulated and all independent thought is a crime. It\u2019s hard to talk about 1984 the novel and its reason for being in <+++>The Summer that Melted Everything</+++> without giving any spoilers away, but I\u2019ll just say that both Orwell\u2019s novel and my novel speak of that herd mentality. How easy it is to come about and how threatening it is to individual choice. As far as other influencers on The Summer that Melted Everything, I can\u2019t think of another book in particular, but reading in general just adds layer after layer to one\u2019s soul. And with a book like The Summer that Melted Everything where we\u2019re looking at the balance between good and evil, well those are things we see every day on the nightly news. Look no further than our daily life, and we are surrounded by the fuel to write about chaos and peace, good and bad. If anything, the book of life itself is the spinning wheel to a story like this. Jeffrey: The book is set in Ohio, but it has such a Southern Gothic feeling to it that I kept thinking the geography could have easily been set in the Deep South such as Donna Tartt's home state of Mississippi or Flannery O'Connor's Georgia or Harper Lee's Alabama. You must have encountered some of that Gothic magical realism in Ohio? Tiffany: Breathed, Ohio, the fictional town in the novel is based on my childhood summers and school-year weekends spent in southern Ohio on the hilly acreage and in the cinderblock house my father was left to him by his parents. Southern Ohio, while in a northern state, does very much have that southern United State twang to it. \u201cAin\u2019t\u201d is as abundant as the wildflowers in the fields, and bullfrogs are the music of the night. It\u2019s a very front porch type of place. It\u2019s a place that has shaped me as an author. I\u2019ve said before, cut me open and there will be a release of fireflies and moon-shine. In many ways, southern Ohio was a magical place to me because it was so different from the more northern part of Ohio where I lived and went to school. That southern portion, the foothills of the Appalachians, is a part of Ohio that has its own magical myths. I was told the hills were full of tigers, released there by a zoo gone belly-up. I would stand on the creek edge and see a gar go swimming by, thinking it was an alligator. Added to this, I\u2019ve always had a gothic mind. Wishing I could live in a derelict mansion with velvet curtains and Shirley Jackson spires. Wolves howling, spiders webbing, magic churning night after night\u2026 Jeffrey: Autopsy Bliss goes on my list of greatest character names in literary history. As I was reading the book I started jotting down the character names because I was struck by the unusual nature of most of the names. Do you start with a name or do they sometimes remain nebulous personalities in search of the right name for a while as you write? Tiffany: First off, thank you for the incredibly wonderful compliment of Autopsy\u2019s name. I\u2019m sure Autopsy himself would be quite pleased. When I start writing the characters, I do have to have their name from the beginning. Having their name really helps to create and flush out the character. I can\u2019t write them without a name. It\u2019s like walking in dark woods by myself, calling for the characters to come out from the trees. But if I don\u2019t have a name to call, who is there to come out? Jeffrey: I jotted down this question while I was still in the early stages of reading the book. Would you want to live with the Bliss Family? They are ethereally wonderful, but of course the tragedies that find them as the plot unfolds probably answers that question. This is truly a book about bad things happening to good people. Are they still walking around in your head or have you managed to lock them in a back room of your mind so you can move onto your next novel? Tiffany: To answer your first question, I would want to live with the Bliss family, if only because I love them all so much. Even with the tragedies that reshape them as a family, I would live with them. Be their daughter, their sister, their best friend, the one crying with them, laughing with them. As the author, I\u2019ve already done all these things. I\u2019ve already felt like I\u2019ve lived in the house with them. What is home, if not with the people we love? I will always share a life with the Bliss Family, as I do my real family. To me there is no difference, because while fictional, the Bliss family exists for me. I always say my characters feel real to me. Maybe I won\u2019t get to physically interact with them in this world, but I feel as if in another plane of the universe, or even the afterlife, I\u2019ll be able to speak to them, to recognize them as people who have lived full lives from womb to coffin. I always say my characters do not begin with the first page I\u2019ve written. They do not end with the last. They existed before and they exist after the book. There are moments and experiences they have that none of will ever know as author and reader. In every way, they are as fully human as any of us. And they are always with me. Even when I write another novel. They are there. They just politely sit down, so new characters can stand up. Jeffrey: Speaking of next novel, where does Tiffany McDaniel go from here? Tiffany: I have eight completed novels. I\u2019m working on my ninth right now. I wrote my first novel when I was eighteen. I wouldn\u2019t get a publishing contract until I was twenty-nine. I spent eleven years struggling to get published. Rejection after rejection made me fear I never would be published. So much heart-ache and pain on the journey to publication, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to be a published novelist. Publishing does move at a snail\u2019s pace, and even with the contract I\u2019ve waited two years for the book to move through the publishing house to the shelf. I\u2019m thirty-one now, having waited in total thirteen years to see one of my novels on the shelf. So where I go from here is to just keep writing. Hoping The Summer that Melted Everything does well enough for me to have the other books published as well. The novel I\u2019m hoping to follow The Summer that Melted Everything up with is When Lions Stood as Men. It\u2019s about a Jewish brother and sister who escape Nazi Germany, flee across the Atlantic, and end up in my land of Ohio of all places. While here they create their own camp of judgment where they serve as both the guards and the prisoners. It\u2019s a story of surviving the guilt that threatens to undo us all. More so, it\u2019s about surviving love and the time when lions once stood as men.

With great faith, Autopsy Bliss\u201d And on a particularly warm day in June 1984 (side note: I love it when a book is set in the same month period as when I\u2019m reading it), our main character meets said devil. \u201cAre you sayin\u2019 that you\u2019re the devil?\u201d \u201cIt is not my first name, but it is one of them.\u201d He reached down to scratch his thigh. It was then I noticed the denim was worn at the knees more than anywhere else. Over top the wear were layers of dirt, as if kneeling were all the time for him. \u201cYou\u2019re lyin\u2019.\u201d I searched his head for horns. \u201cYou\u2019re just a boy.\u201d His fingers twitched. \u201cI was once, if that counts.\u201d Sal seems to appear out of nowhere - a bruised and tattered thirteen-year-old boy claiming to be the devil himself answering an invitation. To say that this book has an unique premise is an understatement. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read, and I simply loved every second I spent reading The Summer That Melted Everything. I definitely took my time with this book in order to savor each and every word. It all felt so crucial to the flow of the story. I also have to mention the writing, but I feel like no words of mine will do enough justice to capture its beauty. Tiffany McDaniel created such an atmosperhic, eerie and whimsical read\u2014 I\u2019m seriously at a loss for words. Here\u2019s one instance in particular that captures the writing perfectly: \u201cI cleared my throat and introduced the boy by naming him the devil. \u201cFielding, I didn\u2019t quite hear you correctly.\u201d \u201cI said devil, all right.\u201d I shifted the bag of groceries to my other arm as Elohim drew down the porch steps, slow and at a slant like he was walking in a large gown that he had to be careful not to step on the edge of lest he fall.\u201d That last sentence has just such a wonderfully specific description. Also, I loved how clever it was that the neighbor\u2019s name was Grayson Elohim (his last name meaning God in Hebrew). And I really want to mention another instance I loved, because I\u2019m weak, and the writer\u2019s words are magnificent: \u201cThe days \u2026 they\u2019ve been blurring together.\u201d \u201cJust hang a calendar on your wall.\u201d \u201cThe walls of hell are not like other walls. I tore a picture of the ocean out from a magazine and hung it on my wall once. An ocean is a good life place. Everyone always seems happy there. And for a moment, I was happy with my picture, but then the blue sky turned gray. The waves, once calm, took a turn to rage. Then came the screams. As I looked closer, I saw the screams came from men drowning in the water.\u201d How does one make words work this beautifully??? Also also, the familial relationships in this book were spectacular. I kept wanting to delve deeper and know more about each family member\u2014 and it all started with the grandma (whom I loved), she was such a unique addition: \u201cAutopsy is an acutely strange name for a man to have, but his mother was an acutely strange woman. Even more, she was an acutely strange religious woman who used the Bible as a stethoscope to hear the pulse of the devil in the world around her. The sounds could be anything: The wind knocking over a tin can. The clicking of rain on the windowpane. The erratic heartbeat of a jogger passing by. Sometimes the things we believe we hear are really just our own shifting needs. Grandmother needed to hear the spook of the snake so she could better believe it actually existed.\u201d And her son (Fielding\u2019s father) was just as compelling to read about: \u201cI always thought he had too demanding a job for someone like him. We are all sensitive to a degree when it comes to the great terrible things in the world, but he was torn apart by them. Some cases affected him more than others, like the one with the little girl who was beaten to death by her addict parents. He\u2019d stare at those bloody crime photos over and over again, long after he put the parents away. Then one day he said he was going out. He drove a few miles outside of Breathed to a roadside bar and said the types of things you should never say to a biker gang. He was in the hospital for six weeks. When I asked him why he did it, he used his one good hand to write I wanted to see for myself on a pad of paper because his mouth was wired shut. His jaw would heal, as would his swollen eyes, cracked ribs, and broken kneecap. The bruises would go on their way, the blood would stop lifting to the surface, and his arm would eventually come out of that cast. But he\u2019d still have the scar at his hairline where the beer bottle was broke. He never tried to hide this scar. He\u2019d brush his thick brown hair back so there\u2019d be no chance of not seeing it. He did just this as he strolled between me and the boy.\u201d I keep thinking about this part. The \u201cI wanted to see for myself\u201d gets me every time. I\u2019ve never encountered such a dynamic father figure in a novel before this one. To borrow Sal\u2019s phrasing, \u201cCompared to him, it\u2019s as if all other men are homeless dogs that bed in the mud.\u201d And his quintessential wife (Fielding\u2019s mother), Stella, was that more intriguing. \u201cIf you wanta see her, you\u2019ll have to go to her. Porch is the farthest she\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s afraid of the rain.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not raining.\u201d \u201cNaw, but it might start.\u201d \u201cShe had that tendency to be overaffectionate. It was almost like a nervous tic. It was the staying in the house that did it. She thought if she loved you enough, you\u2019d never want to leave her, and then the house wouldn\u2019t seem so lonely as it could be to her at times, when it was just her and the vacuum.\u201d And their oldest son, Grand (Fielding\u2019s brother), was the very meaning of his name. \u201cSomething about his eyes made me think of Russia. Perhaps because they were so large, the largest country in the world of his face. Then again, knowing what I know now, maybe it was because his eyes were so like matryoshka dolls, hiding the real him within boxes of lacquered mystery. You\u2019d open one box and find another just the same. No matter how many boxes you took away, there was always one more. Because I told him his eyes were Russian, he decided to learn the language and would at the most unexpected times drop Russian words in a saline accent Tolstoy would have praised, for an Ohioan at least.\u201d I just love it when books feature close siblings and Fielding was, like he mentioned, as in love with his older brother as any young boy could be. The whole family gave off such an incredibly intimate feel and leaving me, once again, at a loss of words. However, when the focus shifted from the family and instead refocused on the devil and the mystery surrounding his crimes, I felt a tiny bit let down. I personally felt more invested in the Bliss\u2019 lives than in the conundrum that is the devil. \u201cBeing the devil made him a target, but it also meant he had a power he didn\u2019t have when he was just a boy. People looked at him, listened to what he said. Being the devil made him important. Made him visible. And isn\u2019t that the biggest tragedy of all? When a boy has to be the devil in order to be significant?\u201d But with an unbearable heat wave in town, tensions rise and strange accidents start to occur that put the Bliss family head to head with their own personal demons. Common sense was starting to melt away. \u201cPeople always ask, Why does God allow suffering? Why does He allow a child to be beaten? A woman to cry? A holocaust to happen? A good dog to die painfully? Simple truth is, He wants to see for Himself what we\u2019ll do. He\u2019s stood up the candle, put the devil at the wick, and now He wants to see if we blow it out or let it burn down. God is suffering\u2019s biggest spectator.\u201d The above passage has been integrated into my heart because of its beauty and understanding. Just\u2026 everything was told in such an astonishingly vivid way. Seriously, the amount of quotes I\u2019ve written down from the book into my own notes is a tad excessive. Simply put, I didn\u2019t want this book to come to an end\u2014 so much so that I even reread the first chapter. And now I cannot wait for what Tiffany McDaniel will write next.

Anyway, Tiffany McDaniel emailed me a review request, mentioning how hard it was for first time authors to get reviews, and I caved in after my Grinch-like heart grew two sizes. I honestly had no idea what to expect with this but I knew I'd struck gold right away. I read a lot of books where the prose is nothing spectacular. I could tell this one was special from the first paragraph or so. The Summer That Melted Everything is Paradise Lost written by Flannery O'Connor, a southern Gothic tale with the power of a hurricane. It's a tale of families, racism, religion, small town mob mentalities, the evil that people hold in their hearts, and a lot of other serious themes. The Summer That Melted Everything is Fielding Bliss' fall from grace, from being an optimistic 13 year old to be a broken adult decades later. The devil's arrival, Sal's arrival, turns his life upside town. The Bliss family and their relationship with Sal fuels the narrative. Fielding Bliss and Sal are fast friends. Sal, devil or not, is wise beyond his years. Father Autopsy is a lawyer and mother Stella is a homemaker who is afraid to go outside. Brother Grand is good at everything, seemingly the boy every girl wants to be with. Sal's arrival changes all of them irrevocably. There is a lot of emotional packed into this book and it sure dredged up some emotions in me. The part with the dog was just the tip of the emotional iceberg. It's thought provoking and has some serious weight to it. As I wrote earlier, it reads a lot like Flannery O'Connor and I felt wrung out after reading it. The building hysteria of the townsfolk toward Sal reminds me of Needful Things a bit. I had no idea how the book would end but I knew it would be comparable to the destruction of Castle Rock. And it was. The last 20% was like watching the end of Old Yeller four or five times. The Summer that Melted Everything is a first novel that reads like a lost classic. A bleak, emotional classic. Five out of Five stars. Note: You can read my interview with Tiffany McDaniel here. ...more Ok....update: A SMALL REVIEW ... but read OTHERS. This community has written amazing ones!!!

It's the summer of 1984 in the small town of Breathed, Ohio. Fielding Bliss is a fairly typical teenager until the day his father, Autopsy (is Autopsy Bliss not one of the best character names you've ever heard?), the town's prosecutor, puts in the newspaper an invitation for the devil to visit Breathed. \"If the devil was going to come, I expected to see the myth of him.

A demon with an asphalt shine. He'd be fury. A chill. A bad cough. Cujo at the car window, a ticket at the Creepshow booth, a leap into the depth of night.\" Imagine Fielding's surprise when a tattered-looking young boy arrives in town, claiming to be the devil. It seems hard to believe, and many think the boy, who calls himself Sal (\"From the beginning of Satan and the first step into Lucifer. Sa-L.\"), is probably a runaway or a kidnap victim, not the devil himself. But he brings an unending heatwave to town, and suddenly, disasters begin to occur in his presence, although no one is quite sure whether he is causing the incidents or if it is people's reactions and fears that are to blame. It isn't long before Sal becomes an integral part of the Bliss family, but their fellow Breathed residents are less than enamored of this fact, as they get riled up by a neighbor and former friend of the Blisses. As the heatwave continues ceaselessly, tempers flare, damaging insults are hurled, friendships end, rumors are spread, and Fielding finds himself suddenly confused by his family. Sal continues to maintain that he is the devil, and he brings about changes in people willing to talk to him, leading them to self-discoveries that change their lives. And as Fielding uncovers secrets his family and others hold, he knows he should react a certain way, but instead he acts like a typical teenager, which only adds fuel to the fire. So many things happen that remain unmentioned by his family, and this lack of discussion causes even more hurt and harm. The Summer That Melted Everything is utterly mesmerizing, and it took me by surprise just how much it touched me. It's a book touching on powerful issues\u2014racism, homophobia, fear of AIDS, agoraphobia, child abuse, religion\u2014yet it never seems heavy-handed or preachy. This is a tremendously moving book; while much of the plot may not be surprising, Tiffany McDaniel did such a great job giving complexity and heart to her characters that you can't really distinguish which characters you should root for and which ones you should view as villains. I completely understood what motivated everyone to act the way they did. The book is narrated by a much older Fielding, who reminisces about that life-changing summer, and the scars it left him with throughout his life. At times it was hard to distinguish when the plot was unfolding as it happened and when Fielding was recounting memories of other times in his life, and the emotional trauma Fielding suffered makes his older self a fairly unsympathetic character periodically. But when the story is fully told, much of his motivation becomes clear (although some plot twists confused me a little). I've often commented that I read from a place of emotion, and if a book is well-written and it touches me emotionally, it resonates for me more than one that does not. It will be a long time before I'll be able to get The Summer That Melted Everything out of my mind. This book might not be for everyone, but if you open your mind, you'll be affected and moved.

She used to go places, but it\u2019s been years since she\u2019s left the shelter of their home. \u201cI once heard someone refer to Breathed as the scar of the paradise we lost. So it was in many ways, a place with a perfect wound just below the surface. It was a resting in the southern low of Ohio, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, where each porch had an orchard of small talk and rocking chairs, where cigarette tongues flapped over glasses of lemonade.\u201d The heat wave that accompanies Sal (Sa from Satan, L from Lucifer) is sudden, intense, not invited, or welcomed. Sal is welcomed only by his new friend Fielding, who recalls the invitation his father issued to the Devil to come to Breathed, Ohio. Tempers rise as disasters befall the townspeople, accusations are flung, and fingers pointed in the direction of the Sal. \u201cThe heat came with the devil. It was the summer of 1984, and while the devil had been invited, the heat had not. It should\u2019ve been expected, though. Heat is, after all, the devil\u2019s name, and when\u2019s the last time you left home without yours?\u201d There\u2019s so much more to this incredibly moving debut novel than meets the eye with these few words that tell you what it\u2019s \u201cabout.\u201d Bigotry in all senses, sexual preference, skin color, abuse, child abuse, HIV/AIDS, aging\u2026 and living. Just the day to day of living seems both precious and tenuous in Breathed in 1984. Tiffany McDaniel does such a tremendous job giving life to her characters. You\u2019ll see, maybe even care for these people, you\u2019ll see how their past makes someone capable of hurting another. How their fears can cause such pain for others. Can love conquer fear?

I've taken a few days to think about this book before writing a review. It's one of those novels that haunt the mind by asking the kind of questions that cut straight to the heart of who you are. Despite the 80s setting, the themes are so relevant, so pertinent that it made for an extremely uncomfortable read. Racism. Homophobia. Mob mentality. Religious extremism. Just when you are busy congratulating yourself that you don't live in a small town in 80s America, you remember the news over the last few weeks and it occurs to you that things haven't changed all that much. People haven't changed all that much. After hitting you hard with the story within the pages, the book follows it up with this lasting taste of human behaviour. All I can think about since reading it is that quote from Gandhi about being the change you want to see in the world. I hope everyone who reads this asks themselves: what would I do? The language is fundamental to the story; the originality of expression is that of a master wordsmith, not a debut author. It is difficult, layered, and complex; providing a stark contrast to the simplistic language of hate the forms the darker currents within the novel. The single words used to embody an entire doctrine of superiority and negation: Faggot, demon, devil, black, nigger. At the same time, there are so many quotes that seem to say so much about the world, but that are also specific to the singular time and space of the novel. I put the book down many times to think about what was said, to roll it around in my mind and even say it out loud. The dichotomy between language and theme was both jarring and beautiful. So did the Devil really accept the invitation to go to Beathed? It hardly matters, it is our free will that makes us who we are. In any case, if we all chose to act like the community of this small town, the Devil would soon be out of a job. It just goes to show that when it comes to horrible acts of violence, us humans don't need any help.

I\u2019m not saying that this isn\u2019t a brilliant work of fiction\u2014it certainly is. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not for me. First, we have a devil dude as the hero.

But I have a cow if a book is full of the word \u201cgod,\u201d and here it\u2019s all over the place. I mean it seems like the name came up a million times. I know the book is not trying to convince us of the goodness of some higher being, since so many terrible things happen. And I know that one of the things it\u2019s trying to show is the super scariness of mobs that go on witch hunts. I just really don\u2019t like a book whose characters are god-fearing folk. Which also leads me to say that I don\u2019t like folksy either, and there\u2019s a lot of that in Breathed, Ohio. Here\u2019s a sample: \u201cI feel bad for \u2018em, I really do, but some say it\u2019s God punishin\u2019 \u2018em for their lifestyle. Maybe He is, punishin\u2019 \u2018em. . . . It makes ya think maybe God is tellin\u2019 \u2018em to stop coming\u2019 together. Maybe He\u2019s tellin\u2019 \u2018em to stay apart.\u201d She patted the sides of her neck. \u201cLordy, this heat has a fury, don\u2019t it?\u201d So while I stand here at my Complaint Board, I might as well finish it up right now. We all know I want to. Okay, besides the devil and god driving me nuts, oh, and let\u2019s not forget the god(!)-awful folksiness, the Southern dialect got on my nerves. Along with the dialect comes the bad grammar, like \u201chow did you like them apples\u201d? Of course it hurt my editor ears, but I can get into the swing of things if it seems realistic. Here, the problem isn\u2019t just the bad grammar but the fact that the narrator only uses it sometimes. Most of the time, he sounds like this erudite storyteller. Does he have bad grammar or doesn\u2019t he? This all brought me to a big a-ha moment: I don't like Southern fiction! Or Midwest fiction or whatever it is. (The story actually takes place in Ohio even though it feels like the South.) And I didn't even know I didn\u2019t like Southern or Midwest fiction until the dialogue and folksiness and God stuff all started bombarding me at once. I winced in pain. The other big thing that turned me off was that this book is chock full of parables. Again, sort of an a-ha moment for me\u2014I really hate parables. It felt like the author wanted to sit me down and teach me a thing or two about life. I\u2019m always up for learning, but please don\u2019t shove life lessons down my throat. Sometimes there was wisdom being thrown my way, and I accepted it happily, but usually I was very conscious that I was there to learn an important lesson. I just resent the hell out of that learning format. Although the language was very rich, it was a little too rich for me. I\u2019d find myself having to stop and contemplate too often. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it made it a hard and slow read. I thought sections could be great stand-alone pieces, long prose poems maybe. But since I had signed up for a novel, I wasn\u2019t loving the interruptions to the plot. I wasn\u2019t dying to pick up the book, because I knew I\u2019d have to think too hard. Call me lazybones, but it really did make my head hurt. One more small complaint and then I\u2019ll walk away from the Complaint Board, I promise. There are these Russian words written in the Russian alphabet scattered throughout, but super infrequently. So infrequently, that at one point I decided they were typos\u2014someone during Kindle production must have occasionally hit the wrong alphabet set. Right when I was reminding myself to send a note to the Kindle people when I finished the book, one of the characters asks another character what was up with the Russian words. What??? What are Russian words doing in the middle of a Southern or Midwestern novel? This is just all wrong. I suspect the writer did this to add some weirdness to it, and weird it was, but it\u2019s pretty bad when you think the book has font problems and it doesn\u2019t. Okay, now I am staring at the Joy Jar. The language, oh the language. To die for. Truly, the writing is phenomenal. There are paragraphs that I could read over and over (not any of the paragraphs that say God God God of course). The author has a very bizarre and cool way of seeing things, and the metaphors just slayed me. The author is so original, so creative, I was in awe. Even the names were fun: The dad was named Autopsy. The brother was named Grand. Here are some sample goodies: \u201cHe was more field than town. More old soul pasture than adolescent attitude.\u201d \u201c\u2026there is no hope to be had. Hope is just a beautiful instance in the myth of the second chance.\u201d \u201cMy hands were still shaking, little vibrations as if they were being chewed on by gnats.\u201d \u201cHe stood there, watching me scratch my chin through my beard. I stopped because he began to look worried I may have fleas.\u201d \u201cOld Fedelia\u2019s way to cool down was by licking her forearms. There she\u2019d be, the shades of her eyes pulled half closed, her tongue amphibiously long and aggressive. \u2018Kangaroos, you stupid boy. Kangaroos.\u2019 Her amber eyes lit with rage as she shook her forearms at me when I asked why she licked them.\u201d \u201cBecause of him and the anger she held onto, her features reached home to their bones, causing cave and shadow.\u201d Besides the language, the plot was juicy, if not sad, dark, and strange. I really do love dark and strange. And there are some hefty issues happening here\u2014racism, gayness, AIDS, mob psychology, good vs. evil, sibling love. The characters were well-drawn and complicated. The story is told by a strange old man who is looking back to a sweltering summer in 1984. Occasionally, we see him in the present, and we learn why he is who he is. The author really made this narrative style work. I tried, I really tried. So many of my trusted Goodreads friends just loved this book, I wanted to be part of the crowd. But, hey, look--my Complaint Board is way fuller than my Joy Jar. So 3 stars it is. But as I said at the start, it\u2019s just me. I have trouble with God and devil stuff, parables, and folksy. I\u2019m thinking most readers will scarf it down in glee. ...more The first thing I noticed when I started reading this novel was the tone, the writing. Southern gothic in Southern Ohio?

This book is dark, darker than dark and anytime a little light, a little beauty shines through you can be sure there is more darkness to follow. Yet, it is this very darkness that makes an impression, makes the book memorable. A town who believes that everything bad that happens is the fault of this young black boy, the devil. A town whose people will act against common sense and their very own nature to become something horrible. A young man struggling with his own sexual identity will come smack against the AIDS epidemic. A young Fielding forced to watch as his family and his life falls apart.

What made him so cynical and negative and a little bit (very) crazy? Like I said, the way the author pieced the story together is one great thing about this book.

It is my favorite read so far this year, and spoke to me like few books do. It's the 80's and McDaniel starts by reminding us of the hysteria over child abuse at the time. I remember the McMartain trial, the social workers giving children toy dolls, asking leading questions, dooming innocent caretakers as pedophiles. It was also the decade we learned of AIDS, how many believed God was exacting judgement for those who defiled Him. These memories set the stage for her own novel by showing us how hysteria and religious fervor are often all too human, but always lead us down a path of destruction. We are introduced to the Bliss family, and their two sons Feilding and Grand. The younger son Feilding, now 84 years old, narrates the story as he looks back to his 13th year, and a summer that changed everything. His father was the town prosecutor. Always an even-handed man, he begins to wonder, is he really sifting out the \"devils,\" or merely playing god. His desire to know leads him to place an add in the paper, inviting the devil to town. When the devil shows up as a 13 year old boy, and the town is facing its hottest summer on record, tempers begin to flare. I loved how McDaniel took on all the questions that lie at the heart of who we are, and what we believe in. Questions such as where does our sense of morality, good and evil, right, and wrong, come from. This isn't a book questioning the existence of God or the devil, but rather how humans have interpreted both. She carefully weaves throughout many emotions and topics, such as pain and suffering, loss and death, family bonds and homosexuality. What lies at the heart of this novel is mob mentality, how families are shattered through their ignorance, and how one man can affect others to blindly follow him through fear. As McDaniels states, \"It is the inability to choose by our own will that lessens us all. It is disease to our sanity, which sickens our good sense until we are the victims of choices we would not normally have been in the company of.\" I was so reminded of our current political situation, and loved this statement as well, \"Fear is ignorance's first shadow\" McDaniel's writing is full of metaphor, and so beautifully written. Even the characters names were brilliant, ones I will never forget. Sometimes it takes a so-called devil to help us see more clearly. I think the novel seeks to show us that love is the only answer that matters in the end.

I loved a lot of things about this book: the 1980s time period, the strong sense of time and place, the intensity of how the book deals with a small town's reaction to difference, Fielding's own internal struggles to figure out where he and his family fit in, and Fielding's intense complicated love for his brother and Sal. And the writing at times blew me away -- there are some truly brilliant passages. But at times I really struggled with how this story was told. The narration hovers just above reality, presenting the story more as a myth or parable. I appreciate the skill involved, but I think my brain may be a bit too concrete to be fully engaged or caught up in how this story is told --- at times I found myself struggling with the devil trope and feeling that the story's elusiveness was overdone. Having said that, at other times it really worked for me and I had real moments of awe. This book definitely deserves to be read -- the end especially is brilliant -- but I suspect that the writer's stylized story telling will not resonate with all readers.

My Review: The Stain of General Terrible Town of Stereotypical \"Hillbillies\" from south Ohio (\"southerners de facto\" but not \"de jure,\" see map below) Posting this critique of a book set in south Ohio has taught me that certain \"hillbillies\" are territorial and attack this book's critics, even to the point of ironic absurdity in defending the validity and verisimilitude of the heinous generalizations, or caricatures, of their people made therein. It's the damnedest thing I've seen on GoodReads. My Review: The Stain of Generalizations I know a debut author writing a legal thriller set in Boston & its courtrooms. He's not visited Boston, but he watched \"Good Will Hunting\" 6 times and all Cheers episodes. All Boston characters under 40 resemble Will Hunting's pals; the older ones, Clifford Clavins from Southie. The lawyers all have southie accents, grew up poor, curse at judges, frequently settle matters via fists as they frequent a Cambridge bar (near Hahvahd), saying things like \"how you like them apples?,\" telling dirty jokes and picking up smaht women whom they later punch repeatedly. The centerpiece suit involves Boston mobs. Russian mobsters have scary tattoos, swill vodka and run whores; the Italians are coffee-guzzling chatterboxes subsisting on spaghetti, adding \"mamma mia\" to make a point. The Irish are red-headed, alcoholic wife-beaters. He even has French & German mobs: the former, arrogant jerks in berets, riding bicycles with basketfuls of baguettes, repeating \"oui, oui\"; the Germans, humorless men in lederhosen. His women are beautiful, poor Moldovans as well as two Russian-speaking Romanian women who closely resemble Dracula's Mina. Near the end, a group of London barristers arrives, as stiff, unemotional men obsessed with class/status, while their female assistants all binge drink at night, cursing in cockney accents with bad teeth smiles. The problem with stereotyping, in addition to being lazy and making for shallow characters, is that it takes all the negatives of an area (here, the South or south Ohio [see map below for response to farcical cries of differences]) and casts a black net over the entire population . This book might have been great had I not been born/raised in the South (little different than south Ohio based on descriptions by Goodreads south Ohioans). With the exception of the 1st person narrator (13-year-old boy with the mentality and dialect of 7-year old Opie Taylor), the characters constitute, separately and severally, the largest collection assembled of offensive Southern stereotypes in the most prejudiced, uneducated, racist, idiotic, childish, homophobic, simple, uber-religious, alcoholic, xenophobic, child-beating and/or gullible hillbillies, gumpbubbas, rednecks, hicks and/or yucks who have lived in the South or south Ohio (or anywhere) since the late 1960s, OR to my recollection, who has walked and talked \"in sentences\" in a work of fiction or nonfiction that I've ever read While I agree with the quote I saw from \"The Library Journal,\" \"At its highest points, this debut novel shines with beauty and lyricism,\" the across-the-board treatment of characters (as either southern rednecks or southern OH backwoods hillbillies*) nauseated me and colored my view of the dialogue, descriptors, actions and prose as cloying, saccharine, laughable and borderline absurd. [Note: the narrator was the only adequately developed character]. Just as someone from north Wisconsin knows her neighbor's attitudes, accents character traits and tics, anyone who has lived in the South for 50 years is qualified and can readily see the stereotypes.* As for me personally, I was born in Dallas, TX, grew up mostly in a small town in the southern part of Miss. and have lived in south Alabama for over 25 yrs now. In my teens and twenties, I had a chip on my shoulder about being stereotyped as a redneck southerner the moment I begin to talk with a drawl (which I've tried to mask, but is obvious). This doesn't bother me nearly as much as it did 25 years ago. Indeed, I've found it to be a decided advantage in litigation battles, particularly with northeasterners (and especially Ivy League-educated pompous ass attorneys) who assume they are smarter just because they talk faster, or conversely, that I lack intelligence simply because I talk slower and flatten my i's (unintentionally). These supercilious a-holes tend to let down their guard and get what's coming to them, but good . I've had more than my fair share dealing with some of the most ignorant, overly zealous, in-your-face, country-boy-can-survive Southerners you'd ever meet. These few handfuls of people fit snugly within the stereotype you see on made for TV movies. Most people though, who I knew and grew up around, don't at all fit the stereotype factors, the sole exception being the Southern drawl. Considering this, my opinions vary considerably from those of the readers who loved this novel. I don't blame or quibble with those who've loved this book, and who see it altogether normal that the narrator and other characters repeatedly use, in conveying a \"country\" thinking, what I consider mawkish metaphors, syrupy similes, maudlin prose, hokey analogies, effusive euphemisms. I found this example of the pulpy little perorations populating this novel: \"People always ask, Why does God allow suffering? Why does He allow a child to be beaten? A woman to cry? A holocaust to happen? A good dog to die painfully? Simple truth is, He wants to see for Himself what we\u2019ll do. He\u2019s stood up the candle, put the devil at the wick, and now He wants to see if we blow it out or let it burn down. God is suffering\u2019s biggest spectator.\u201d Insofar as the story, I'll limit my comments to noting that the effect of the story's laudable messages was considerably diluted by the surfeit of social themes stuffed like sardines into this novel: (view spoiler) [racism, teen suicide, homophobia, short person phobia, depression, animal cruelty, cuckoldry, psychological fears, religious bigotry, alcohol abuse, child abuse, AIDS, mass suicide and a mob mentality ala the Ku Klux Klan (hide spoiler) ] . As a consequence, the novel becomes overly didactic and pedantic. Author Tiffany McDaniel [revised 8/18: 2.1 stars, may lower if \"hillbillies\" continue attacking \"redneck\" for honest review; see map below, in relief to such bathos] _______________________ *I've been attacked for equating people from south Ohio to people from the South. Yet, from what these folks have told me, there's little significant difference when viewing the stereotypes, with the exception of an imaginary line drawn between states. So please, south Ohioans, save your palaver for a neighbor who will blindly concur. BTW, apparently in Ohio, hillbillies call themselves \"hillibillies.\" So, there's that difference too.

That no one ever sat us down and patted our heads and said sometimes a man loves another man and they make something nice together. beautiful, isn't? There is a strong story here and it unrolls at a good pace, giving us just enough information to keep us moving forward with the characters. The initial idea of a child arriving in response to an invitation for the devil to present himself is a great starting point for a story. My main issue, however, is with the content. The Summer that Melted Everything deals with many serious issues: cruelty, justice, innocence, hatred, miscarriage, sexual assault, suicide, animal death, and both racial and homophobic hate. Now, I totally think all these issues can be in one book. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unrealistic that they\u2019re all in this book in the SLIGHTEST. . . but I also felt the ramifications of both the homophobia and the racial hate crimes weren\u2019t explored properly or with sensitivity. Also the story became overconsumed with its portrayal of good and bad, wrong and right - moral codes of reality - that it lost its way. I kept forgetting that the narrator of the story was Fielding as his voice kept being buried, and I had to dig to find him. He, along with other strong characters, became the quintessence of moral sentiment. I found the vibe throughout to be on a monotone level, even at its most climatic moments, and I think the reason for that is for the very fact that, along the way, I lost Fielding Bliss. I wanted to feel more for the characters and care more about their fate, but the constant flux of moral values, be it negative or positive values, somewhat silenced the real story. Perhaps the novel was too ambitious in its choice of themes. The beginning chapters make the reader extremely curious about the supernatural. Then slowly, themes of human resentment, creep in. The writing was not crowded; it was wonderfully executed as well. However I still think concentrating on fewer themes would have had more impact. There were places I felt the writer is trying to address all the relevant minority issues in one small novel. Despite everything, this was a fascinating debut novel to read. A new, original story with many elements that provoked welcomed emotions. Even though it does read like a first book and suffers some of the consequences of a shaky plot, it is a solid 3 star from me. ...more \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 \u201cYou can tell a lot about a man by what he does with a snake.\u201d Autopsy Bliss is a prosecuting attorney in the small town of Breathed, Ohio.

As the court\u2019s attorney, the responsibility falls on him to sift out those devils. However, he suffers a crisis of faith, after discovering he\u2019d sent an innocent man to his death, a man in whose guilt he was absolutely certain, nonetheless. So he decides to pen a letter inviting the devil to come to town. He\u2019d like to meet the man himself. Size him up to try and determine if he\u2019d ever seen him before in the courtroom, in all those men and women he\u2019s sent away. If so, then maybe he did some good after all, but could all those good deeds make up for that one horrible mistake? Autopsy and the rest of the town are taken aback, when the devil actually accepts his invitation, bringing with him a heatwave the likes of which the town has never experienced before. However the devil in the guise of a thirteen-year-old black boy is not exactly what anyone was expecting. The story is told by Autopsy\u2019s son, Fielding, who is now an old man looking back on the summer of 1984 which changed the course of his entire life. In Fielding we see a man haunted by his past. A man who\u2019s become this wretched human being, this ruined and broken individual, this wasted potential. So as he\u2019s telling his story, we can\u2019t help but sense this looming disaster which hangs over our head like the Sword of Damocles. While we may not yet know what\u2019s in store for Fielding, we can only assume that it will be some tragic, soul-crushing event which hollowed out this boy into this bitter husk of a man we see before us. There's this omnipresent sense of foreboding throughout; the pain and sorrow are palpable. At first I couldn't quite put my finger on the crux of the problem I was having with the story. The writing has a beautiful, even lyrical quality to it, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice the similarities to one of my favorite books, To Kill a Mockingbird . With the small town setting, and a morality tale focused on a group of kids and their attorney father. It seemed as though the author had some profound things to say about sin, prejudice, racism, homophobia, hero worship, mob mentality, and shirking the blame for all your troubles onto some devil rather than taking responsibly for your own life. But finally it hit me, the festering tickling at the back of my mind, the questioning as to why am I not falling head over heels for this charming little tale: The entire story is just an endless parade of metaphors . Eventually all those metaphors begin to feel like a knife, and this slow slicing became a form of torture, a literally lingchi if you will, or death by a thousand cuts. Another problem is that the story revolves around a couple of kids who don't talk or act anything at all like any kids you're liable to encounter. They\u2019re wise beyond their years, with deep insight into all the goings on of the town, and forever speaking in metaphors. Sal, in particular, has a seemingly endless number of parables to relate to any situation. Amazing indeed for a thirteen-year-old boy from a broken family, with little to no education. Or is he the devil? You tell me. That's one of the lingering questions throughout. This novel was clearly written to impress those scholarly readers, but maybe it\u2019s a little too clever for its own good. Take a look at a few of the character names for instance, Autopsy, Fielding, Grand, Sal, Stella, Dresden, Yellch, Fedelia, you get the idea. This type of exquisite writing can be breathtaking when taken in small doses, but when stretched to novel proportion becomes a real chore to wade through. Who knows, maybe you'll love the symbolism and all those metaphors and parables. I wish you luck. But I'm a simple man with simple cravings. I'm content with my burger and fries. This duck a l'orange with foie gras ravioli is all yours. For anyone curious to sample the author's writing style and a few of the countless metaphors, check the spoiler tag. (view spoiler) [\u201cYou know, Fielding, the thing about breaking something that no one much thinks about is that more shadows are created. The bowl when intact was one shadow. One single shadow. Now each piece will have a shadow of its own. My God, so many shadows have been made. Small little slivers of darkness that seem at once to be larger than the bowl ever was.

I don't read blurbs often so I didn't read the rest, but just that one or two sentences was enough for me. But the book is about so much more than that. It's about a loss of innocence. It's about families and communities and friendship and sibling relationships and romantic relationships. It covers race issues and LGBT issues and even different than usual psychological issues. And the book does them all WELL. It does not overload you with content, it has a really nice balance. The characters in this book are absolutely so well written. Many times throughout the novel I found it impossible to believe that she was a debut author because this was so well written. Sal, Fielding, Grand, his parents, Elohim, all of them were just so fleshed out. They were complex and complicated, filled with so many feelings and backstories and conflict, and yet they were simple. Prone to human desires and human feelings that everyone feels. Throughout the novel it was hard to see who the villain was. There were obvious villains, but there were moments where I questioned who was bad and who was good. But then I realized that that was the brilliance of the way the author wrote these characters, they were human , they were flawed and could be both bad and good. I loved the setting of the story. I loved this small southern town where it was incredibly hot all summer. There were times when just the descriptions of the heat made me feel like I was experiencing it with them. I could picture this town and all its inhabitants perfectly because it was a simple, yet elaborate, setting. Overall, there's just not enough praise I could give this book. I may have had problems with the book, if I did I honestly don't remember them as by the end I completely had forgotten them. If I had issues, they clearly weren't important. This book broke my heart. It made me feel angry, upset, and even, although rarely, happy. I feel like I lived through this book with the characters and that's not a small thing for me to say. As a debut novel this is amazing, as a novel in general this is still amazing. Tiffany McDaniel definitely has a reader in me for life because I just loved everything about this book so much.

The Summer That Melted Everything has received lots of praise. I was not certain I wanted to read it but there it was sitting on the library shelf and before I knew it, it was in my book bag. Many people have written eloquent reviews of The Summer That Melted Everything . I\u2019m not going to try to outdo them. The Summer That Melted Everything is a read that will mean different things to different people, one from which we each will choose what we take Fielding and Sal will forever be in my heart. Birth/Death, Understanding/Intolerance, Good/Evil, Young/Old, Black/White, Right/Wrong, Guilt/Innocence, Rain/Drought, Fire/Ice, Heaven/Hell, opposites that attract and meld in their morality. The author, Tiffany McDaniel was on to something. She made me think as I was given a glimpse of that long, hot summer of 1984. I\u2019m glad I read The Summer That Melted Everything and look forward to see what else McDaniel might have in store for me. ...more Here is the truth: this book is perfect.

I am sorry if I already used the word perfection too many times at the very beginning of my review, but the truth is, I am lost for other words. This book, to me, was pure perfection. It played with my emphaty in a way I can't describe, it broke my heart, torn me apart and I am still picking myself up, days after I finished it. I am lost for words and I already know that my review won't do a justice to this masterpiece, but I will try my best. The Summer That Melted Everything talks about summer in a year 1984, the year when the HIV virus was discovered and scientists gave it a name. It takes place in Breathed, a small town in the West America, where people are still afraid of unknown and are very judgamental. Even though this book contains more then few diverse elements (like gay people, black people and people with dwarfism), the way characters talk about people and things that are diverse or different is plain brutal. For example, people say that AIDS is God's punishment for gays, God's tool to get rid of them. Those kind of references you'd hear even from characters you'd like. Keep in mind that it is 1984 and even though that kind of phrases were hard to read about, they also represent the reality of the story. The novel is written in first person, following two different times: first being placed in 1984 when Fielding was a 13 years old boy and the second that takes place when Fielding is and old angry man, and we can see how much tool summer 1984 took on him, how happenings from that summer shaped him as a person and destroyed him in a way. The writting style is astonshing. McDaniel's voice is so beautiful . It is different from other voices I read and it probably has a lot to do with the fact that The Summer That Melted Everything is a piece of literary fiction. This book reminded me how much I enjoy reading literary fiction, even though I don't read it too often. My opinion is that this book demands to be read more then once. I know I will reread it for sure in my close future. This is not a happy book, it will probably leave you under an impression and you won't be able to stop thinking about it. I already knew this was a five stars read for me after I finished it, but I also learned to appreciate it even more after some time passed. I would give it all the stars in the world. This is the best book I have read this year and it is one of the best books I read in my lifetime. Tiffany McDaniel surprised me with her debut novel and after reading only one book written by her, I already know I want to read everythig she'll write in the future. Recommending books is something I often do in my reviews, but if there's one book I would recommend of all the books I liked, it would be this one. I really, wholeheartedly recommend you to read this book! Note: I got this book for free via Netgalley in an exchange for an honest review. Thank you Tiffany McDaniel and St. Martin's Press.

So choose a good day, a happy time, to pick this one up. Set in a small town in Ohio in 1984, we are introduced to the fact that it\u2019s the beginning of the hottest, driest Summer anyone can remember. We meet a family, the parents and their two sons: Fielding, aged 13, and his elder brother, Grand. The father\u2019s name is Autopsy Bliss (yes, there\u2019s a lot of strange names here), a lawyer and a religious man. For reasons I haven\u2019t quite grasped, Autopsy decides to write an open letter inviting the devil to visit this town. And the devil duly arrives, at least he says he is the devil, in the shape of a thirteen-year-old black boy. The town is populated by rather strange folk and the atmosphere feels like that of a place lost somewhere in the 19th Century, so far removed is it from the 1980\u2019s England I grew up in. In fact, the town is so estranged from any other conurbation that after the stock of ice cream is destroyed at the local store it takes the whole of the Summer for it to be replenished. We follow the story of the family and of \u2018the devil\u2019 (given the moniker Sam soon after his arrival) through the ramblings of a 71-year-old Fielding looking back on that insufferable season. We know it\u2019s not going to end well, Fielding\u2019s stumbling thoughts and uncoordinated actions make that clear. His memories are not good ones. In all honesty the prose is not entirely to my taste. There are some brilliant lines and some genuine wisdoms that made me pause and think, but there are also long, overblown sections that prompted to to drift off and to lose, temporarily, the thread of the narrative. It didn\u2019t seem to flow in the way the best novels do, but at the same time I retained enough interest to keep me turning the pages. In particular, there were glimpses of Sal\u2019s background that began to piece together the life he\u2019d had before he arrived in the town. I wanted to follow this through, to see where it took me. I\u2019m not sure I was ever totally taken in by events but I can say that towards the end I was totally captivated by the power of the piece. I found it hard to read but impossible to put down. Most reviews I\u2019ve subsequently read are from readers who absolutely loved this book and I\u2019m sure it will capture a good deal of attention. Despite some personal reservations, I do feel that this is an extraordinary potent piece of literature from the hands of a young writer. My thanks to St Martins Press and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. ...more I could go on for days about how well written this book is.

You can feel her attention to detail in every line. The word \"masterful\" comes to mind. I hesitate to recommend this book to some of you. Unfortunately, the list of people who this book might break over its knee is far too long to name each and every one of you. Up until the 85% mark the book is manageable in how it deals with loss and grief. But then 95% comes in like a Mac truck through your emotions. Unfortunately, your feels get caught in the grill and you're dragged for the final 5%. By the end of the book, you're nothing but scraps of flesh on a skeleton. Not since Stephen King's Revival have I felt so utterly drained after finishing a work of fiction. Usually I don't like repeated punches to the gut, as I stated in my review of The Kite Runner . It gets old. It gets boring. You're just waiting for the next tragedy and the book suffers due to that. Or the book is lighthearted in its sorrow, as with A Man Called Ove , and the tragedy feels glossed over and paperthin. Sure it's sad. But you know the Grinch's heart is gonna grow three sizes this day and blah blah blah... The most striking difference between the aforementioned books and this one is the terrifically quirky characters. You have a little person who's role in the book is far from just a supporting character; a cute little girl with a prosthetic leg and a shitty home life; a character who's terrified of being rained on; and some of the most unique names I've come across. Too often I'll read a book with unique names like Fuquery or Papa Platypus or Jim-Jim Jimmy Jimkins and I'll roll my eyes and wish the author had done better. Here, the character names fit their respective characters. The odd names are not just for show. They are functional. I like that. But more than that, I came to really love these characters. They were real people to me. Which made what happened to them that much more soul crushing. Suffice it to say that this book is way above the level of tragedy porn. There is tragedy. Loads of it. But, oddly enough, I never felt it to be too much. Actually, it did feel like too much, as in too much to handle. But never did it feel gratuitous, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I never felt like Tiffany McDaniel was thinking \"How can I make the next tragedy even worse than this last one?\" The horrible happenings herein seemed to follow a natural timeline, as if progression was not only needed, but wanted. I wanted to know what happened next because the last thing was so goddamn horrific I couldn't imagine what might come next. Well, sports fans, this motherfucker's ending is a blistering experience. I believe my exact words were, \"Holy fucking shit.\" I've read some disturbing scenes in my day (hell, I've even written my fair share), but none of them compare to what happens in this book. You can tout that you're the KING OF EXTREME HORROR! and label your books with PUSSIES NOT WELCOME! but you will never match the strength of something as emotionally powerful as McDaniel has accomplished. So you guys can have your shockfests. I'll take real literature over that nonsense any day. Because if you don't care about the people this horrific shit is happening to, what's the point? In summation: Tiffany McDaniel is too cool for school. I will not drop the age-old cliche of \"I can't believe this is a debut novel!\" because that wouldn't be true. This feels as if someone poured their entire self into a book, and if McDaniel never writes another novel I'd be sad but okay with that. Because this novel is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I will say that until another author proves me wrong. Final Judgment: Tiffany McDaniel is my generation's Harper Lee. ...more 2.5 Stars I Guess I couldn\u2019t take the heat\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.

It\u2019s a beautifully written book and the story is unique in its telling and I normally love Southern Fiction but this one just didn\u2019t sit well with me as from the outset I really didn\u2019t engage with any of the characters and I found the story too deep and dark and to be honest there is a little magic realism running through the novel which doesn\u2019t work for me at the best of times. Perhaps I need to be from the South or know more about it in order to enjoy this novel. This book reminded me very much of The Enchanted in its tone and uniqueness. This book wasn't for me and I am know that I am in the minority on my views on this one as most of my Good reads friends have loved it so I think its best to decide for yourself as the writing is excellent and the story unique.

But as Sal begins to get involved with some of the people from the small town, strange things begin to happen and darkness seems to follow Sal wherever he goes. I was just so taken aback by the complexity and brilliance of this novel. It is told from Fielding's point of view in large flashbacks and flash forwards to the the future, when Fielding is a old man. And this back and forward alternating perspective really worked. You get glimpses of what he is like in the future, and slowly start to understand why he is the way he is, and what exactly happened that summer. It wasn't so much the story that captivated me (although it was in itself, captivating), it was the writing. The powerful atmosphere and the emotional, resonating quotes and dialogues throughout the book were hauntingly beautiful and incredibly moving. There were numerous occasions where I had to stop reading and sit in wonder at what I just read. At times it was utterly depressing, but not in a bad way! The characters are all so deep and powerful. They all have their own unique stories and a darkness about them. Fielding was probably the most innocent and naive of the lot. His brother, mother and father were fascinating Would I recommend The Summer that Melted Everything? Absolutely! I am surprised that more people don't know about this novel and I have a feeling that its going to be huge! And I can't believe that this is a debut!! I can't wait to see what else the author has up her sleeve for the future!

There were so many issues covered in one book \u2013 religion, racism, agoraphobia, homophobia, child abuse, anger, fear, and AIDS .... and then there was the overuse of metaphors. I love \u201cflowery prose\u201d, as some have called it, but this was a little over the top...in my opinion. I felt as if the author was trying too hard; trying to get everything she could think of in this one book \u2013 a bit like someone wearing too much gaudy jewelry \u2013 to me, it took away from the beauty. McDaniel did a wonderful job creating the sense of time and place and developing well-drawn characters. Maybe I am being a bit of a curmudgeon, but I kept thinking of the quote by Coco Chanel \u2013 \u201cBefore you leave the house, look in the mirror and remove one accessory.\u201d I felt Tiffany McDaniel overly accessorized in this novel and had she removed a little, it could have been a work of art. ...more \u201cYou can tell a lot about a man by what he does with a snake.\u201d Fielding Bliss looks back on the life-altering summer of 1984, when his father invited the devil to their hometown of Breathed, Ohio.

The Summer That Melted Everything is such a unique book. The synopsis above barely scratches the surface of what this book is about. It has a whimsical, magical feel, but it's also very dark. Atmospherically, it reminds me of Big Fish (movie), Beasts of Southern Wild (movie) and The New and Improved Romie Futch . Romie Futch is\u00a0described as a \"Southern Gothic tall tale\"; I'm not sure if Ohio counts as the South, but I think that label fits this book too! The writing is impressive. It addresses heavy themes such as racism, homophobia, AIDS hysteria, and domestic violence, but it never felt heavy-handed. Each chapter begins with an epigraph from Paradise Lost by John Milton, which helps sets the mood. Every word and name feels intentionally chosen and the story is well-constructed. The story is told by 84-year-old Fielding Bliss, primarily in flashbacks. He is consumed by guilt and regret, so we know this story probably doesn't have a happy ending. How did the caring thirteen-year-old we meet in the flashbacks turn into this self-destructive old man? He was so close with his family during the summer of 1984, so why does it seem that he lost all contact with them? Cowardice is always too late to the fact that bravery has the better chance. Our better chance could\u2019ve been understanding. It could\u2019ve been soaring from that which has too long been believed to be a sin. And yet it\u2019s far too easy to be the coward when it requires nothing more than a lie. The book is filled with peculiar and interesting characters. Fielding's father Autopsy Bliss reminded me of Atticus Finch ( TKAM ). He's a fair-minded man who welcomes Sal into his home with open arms, despite the growing concerns of the community. Stella Bliss, Fielding's mother, won't step out of the house out of fear of the rain. Instead of leaving the house to travel, she decorates each room of her house as a different country. Fielding idolizes his older brother Grand, a high school baseball player whose reputation fits his name. Fedelia Bliss, their aunt, wears ribbons in her hair as a reminder of each of her husband's betrayals. Sal quickly bonds with the Bliss family and becomes especially close with Fielding. He's thirteen, but he speaks in parables. He seems much wiser than his years, but he's also seen more than any child should have to. These are just the people inside the Bliss household. There are so many more memorable\u00a0major and minor characters. \u201cWhat these poor souls were desperate for was a light. But the thing about light is it all looks the same when you\u2019re in the dark, so you can\u2019t tell if what powers that light is good or if it is bad, because the light blinds you to the source of its power. All you know is that it saves you from the darkness \u2026 They reached for that brightness, and while the light distracted them, while it comforted them in its false rescue, the dark power behind it did its work, and before any of them knew it, they were not being saved by the light, they were being changed by it.\" This book illustrates mob mentality. A charismatic leader whips people into a frenzy and the townspeople easily rationalize their atrocious behavior.\u00a0There are hints of the terrible events to come, but it begins with disturbing rhetoric. Over the summer, the situation slowly escalates to horrifying levels. When the people of Breathed find a \"monster\"\u00a0to pin blame on, they become blind to their own monstrous behavior. Many of the strange events attributed to Sal were actually caused by the townspeople. \"Sometimes the things we believe we hear are really just our own shifting needs.\" The \"devils\" in Breathed aren't the ones who you would expect. They are neighbors and friends. There were no visual markers or previous indications of the evil they were capable of. I recently read an interview with a man talking about his professional colleagues. I can't remember the exact quote or numbers, but it was something like \u224810% were consistently bad, \u224810% were consistently good, and the behavior of the other \u224880% depended on who they worked with that day. Many of the citizens of Breathed reminded me of that 80%. This book makes it clear how easy it is to be led astray by blind certainty or a trusted individual. Even the character with the purest heart had moments where they were certain and proven wrong after it was too late. \u201cWhen glass is whole, it\u2019s good. When it\u2019s broken, it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s swept up. It\u2019s thrown away. Sometimes thrown away too soon. Think of a window, Sal said. Imagine a violence breaking that window. All those shards of broken glass fall to the floor. The violence is inside the house now, wrestling you. It could kill you, so you grab one of the shards and stab. The violence dies and you are saved. Saved by the broken glass. Isn\u2019t that a funny thing? To be saved by the bad. Sometimes, not sweeping that bad up and throwing it away will save you in the end. It just might. So to defend the devil means defending the good of the bad. That\u2019s what I was doing, Fielding. Hoping that all those folks are just shards of broken glass and one day in the future, they\u2019ll save someone by being just that.\" The events at the end were so horrifying that it did make it difficult for me to put on my grey-tinted glasses. However, when I go back to \u201cYou can tell a lot about a man by what he does with a snake\" and the context, I understand why the story went the direction it did. I also have a personal issue where stories with allegorical characters make me hyper-aware that I'm in the middle of a story, so I am not 100% invested in the character's fates. Even though I didn't feel as ripped apart by tragedy as I probably should have, I did feel deeply for these characters. It felt like a gut punch when Fielding uttered the one word to his brother that changed their relationship forever. When the Bliss family hit their lowest point, my heart broke.\u00a0Sal's stories are so beautifully told that they bring tears to my eyes. (Without giving anything away, the stories about the fall and the rope really stick out in my mind.) \"Isn\u2019t it time we put the shovels down instead of digging more holes? The more holes we dig ... the less solid ground any of us will have to stand on.\u201d I would love to \u00a0go on and on about my favorite parts, but it's best to experience it for yourself! This book's message will always be relevant. Part of what makes it terrifying is that the events are so recognizable. It's been hard for me to watch the news lately without thinking about Sal and Breathed, Ohio. There is so much in this book that it is impossible to unpack it all in just one read. The first read is really good, but it will definitely reward a reread. The Summer That Melted Everything is a deeply affecting book that\u00a0will provoke much discussion. Highly recommended! _____________________ Quotes I was reminded of while reading: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Bruce Wayne: We're criminals, Alfred. We've always been criminals. Nothing's changed. Alfred: Oh, yes it has, sir. Everything's changed. Men fall from the sky, the gods hurl thunderbolts, innocents die. That's how it starts, sir. The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel.

This story is all about contradictions. There was a message here to be pondered and the way it unravels is unique and special, but for me it got lost because there was too much going on here and not enough going on. Too many (huge) issues watered down the message for me. In between the issues, it was convoluted and slow. It was shocking and devastating, but it didn't evoke the emotions I can usually access too easily. It feels like I read this so long ago. Or I dreamt that I read it. That's what this book is to me now just a few weeks after finishing it...certainly not forgettable but blurry and almost unreachable, the way you remember pieces of a dream days later and you are almost relieved that you can't remember the dark details, though you are shaken just the same. 3.5 stars. ...more #SALE #DealAlert!!

Right around that time Sal; a colored thirteen year old boy shows up to Autopsy's work and becomes friends with Fielding. Sal tells Fielding that he is the DEVIL and was sent there. The entire town freaks out at first unable to believe it. However; bad things started to happen around the time SAL aka the Devil shows up and everyone starts to blame Sal. Fielding find himself trapped in a world of racism. His father and mother took Sal in and adopted him as their own while the town hated him for his color and for appearing to their town. Sal was a very likable boy and very soon he became very attached to Fielding and his family. Sal had a lot life experiences and I was fascinated with his ways of thinking and the way he showed evil and good to his now new family. \"A boy holds a gun but cannot fire it, even when he knows it is the right thing to do. A god would never hold the gun in the first place\u2026On the day you are asked to hold the gun once more, You will have to decide whether to stay the child\u2026or finally become the man.\" This book was so different from anything I've read before. I found myself so confused at first but then as I kept on reading I slowly felt deep into this story and WOW what a trip this was. This story is about life, choices, death, good and evil. I really enjoyed the connection between Fielding and his older brother Grand. Grand holds a special place in my heart. He was smart, funny and loved hard. Fielding worshiped his bother and Grand loved him so hard in returned; Sal was a great character who definable made an impact as well. \"Sometimes I think older brothers should not be allowed. We fall in love with them too much. They are our everything, all the while, they hurt out of sight for our sake.\" When I hit eighty-three percent on this book I found myself unable to stop crying. I cried all the way until the end because it just hurt so much and the writing was just incredible. I encourage everyone to read this book; it is a book that will have you deep thinking about the cruelty of people and the consequences that evil and selfish choices of people made. You will have to dive in going open minded because this book will have you rethinking everything you ever knew. \u2605F(BR) with my girl War\u2605 Amazon Purchase Link -> https://amzn.com/B01AGIBQTO Book Order: For more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit: ...more<---C>Tiffany McDaniel</---C>", "Title": "The Summer that Melted Everything"},
