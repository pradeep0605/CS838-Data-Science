Do you know where you were when you heard that Kurt Cobain was dead? What about that guy from Alice in Chains who wasn\u2019t found for like days,<---M> rotting away in his apartment</---M>, do you remember that? What was the song that was playing the first time you slow danced? Does \u2018Darling Nikki\u2019 make you blush? What\u2019s the most important song that you\u2019ve ever put on a mix tape? Okay, enough. You get it. It\u2019s just overkill now. Confession time: I was a groupie. I was. Really. Duran Duran was my group of choice. Those bastard fans in Wham! and Culture Club were pussies compared to us Duranies. We knew how to obsess. There is still a bond among us. Whenever I meet a woman born around 1970, I know that I can slip in a \u2019Save a Prayer\u2019 reference and our eyes will meet and there will be that conspiratorial nod... We know that we both cried when we saw the \u2018Feed the World\u2019 video and that they were robbed (ROBBED!) of air time. Damn Bono. It wasn\u2019t until I met my future husband that I actually LISTENED to Duran Duran. Those bass lines are awesome! I knew I loved John Taylor for more than his bangs and impeccable fashion sense! I never knew that certain instruments made certain sounds. I was just used to the end product. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a sucker for a good \u2018bridge\u2019, whatever that means. Maurice was also the first male friend that actually liked Duran Duran and didn\u2019t mock me for my past transgressions. Boys can be so dumb. Don\u2019t you know that we\u2019ll like you more if you admit that you\u2019ve sung along to Rio? Maurice actually brought me to my first Duran Duran show. We sat on the grassy lawn at Great Woods in Mansfield, Mass and rocked to Ordinary World and danced to The Reflex. I was so proud of him. How many boyfriends will do that? Okay. So, you see where I\u2018m going with this, right? I mean it\u2019s so obviously clear . I may have been a groupie, but Maurice was a full out audiophile. To the point of annoyance.. We\u2019d be out walking and he\u2019d hear something from an open window somewhere and say \u2018Oh! Zeppelin 4! Awesome! Did you know that Rolling Stone rated it only 66 out of the top 500 albums! What assholes!\u2019 and then a rant would ensue and that would turn into some sort of \u2018ultimate band\u2019 fantasy. And so on. He would wake me up in the middle of the night to ask me what I thought about Geddy Lee\u2019s vocals on \u2018Caress of Steel\u2019 versus \u2018Fly by Night\u2019. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed to go total Wayne\u2019s World when Bohemian Rhapsody came on while we were driving. My favorite was when we would play \u2018who should have been on the Lynyrd Skynyrd plane?\u2019 On our first date, Maurice ended it, not with a kiss, but a \u2018I\u2019m going to make you a mix tape!\u2019 I was amused. I was concerned. I was somewhat petrified. This guy was a prog rock fan. Hadn\u2019t I spent most of my adolescence mocking Rush and Yes? Is this karma taking a bit ol\u2019 dump on me? He mailed me the tape. I was living in Boston at the time, he was in the boondocks of NH. I held it. I read the songs. I put it on my desk. I went out for ice cream. Around day 3, I finally had the room to myself (living in a boarding house with 40 other woman, that was a feat) and carefully placed it in my boom box. The first song was \u2018Sweetness\u2019 by Yes. \u2019Honey Pie\u2019 by The Beatles, \u2019She\u2019s a Rainbow\u2019 The Rolling Stones, \u2019Come up and See Me (Make me smile)\u2019 by Duran Duran, \u2018It\u2019s a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl' by Faust, The Musical Box by Genesis: She's a lady, she's got time, Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your face. She's a lady, she is mine. Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your flesh. Not. Very. Subtle. Anyway, this book. This could be Maurice and me. I know that some people dismiss <---A>Rob Sheffield</---A> and I don\u2019t know enough about him to say that that\u2019s okay. Maurice would probably know\u2026 he knew all the rock critics. But, this story\u2026 these mix tapes. They spoke to me in a completely sappy selfish way. I see a lot of Maurice in Rob. Another confession: I don\u2019t read the blurbs about books before I start them. If I like the title or the cover or someone said \u2019You should read this\u2019, I will go with that. I had no idea that this was a sad love story. (Yeah, I know\u2026 the title is \u2018Love is a Mix Tape: Life and loss, one song at a time\u2019 --I didn\u2019t really catch the loss part. There\u2019s Rob. Then there\u2019s Rob and Renee and then there\u2019s RobinRenee and then there\u2019s just Rob again. There\u2019s a part where he\u2019s talking about just being Rob again: \u201cI now get scared of forgetting anything about Renee, even the tiniest detail, even the bands on this tape I can\u2019t stand--if she touched them, I want to hear her fingerprints.\u201c I wonder if Maurice ever thought things like \u201cI suddenly realized how much being a husband was about fear: fear of not being able to keep somebody safe, of not being able to protect somebody from all the bad stuff you want to protect them from. Knowing they have more tears in them than you will be able to keep them from crying.\u201d I know that I did. Rob relates almost everything through music. He reminds me a lot of Rob Fleming from Nick Hornby\u2019s High Fidelity . The guy that always has headphones on, that totally judges you by your cd collection, that has a song for everything. Maurice was always gently forcing me to like his music. I\u2019m a whiny guitar alternadude type of gal. Play me some REM or Blind Melon or Polyphonic Spree. I would get in the car and find a cd in the player and suddenly I\u2019m listening to Argent\u2019s \u2018Hold your Head Up\u2019 or \u2018Karn Evil 9 1st Impression Pt, 1 & 2\u2019 by ELP. This went on for TWENTY years\u2026. He never tired of it. I have milk crates full of Maurice creations. I can identify with these people. I would strike back with some of my own and we would argue during long car rides what was neutral ground. ELP was out. Genesis was neutral. Poi Dog Pondering was out. INXS was neutral and so on\u2026 I guess that what I\u2019m trying to say is that this book might not be for every one. The minute gestures and pop culture commentary might annoy people. They may not laugh where I laughed or cried when I cried. That\u2019s okay. There are other books. I\u2019m just glad that I had the opportunity to read this one. I feel less alone and that\u2019s a biggie for me. \u201cThey always end with our favorite song \u201cKiller Parties\u201d and sometimes I think, man, all the people I get to hear this song with, we\u2019re going to miss each other when we die. When we die, we will turn into songs, and we will hear each other and remember each other.\u201d I can\u2019t think of a truer sentiment. Maurice is the Smashing Pumpkins \u20181979\u2019 when I\u2019m driving on a warm spring night with the windows down. He\u2019s Nanci Griffith\u2019s \u2018Late Night Grande Hotel\u2019 when I\u2019m having a good cry in the tub. He\u2019s Rage Against the Machine\u2019s \u2018Killing in the Name Of\u2019 when I\u2019m annoyed with hipsters. It sounds corny, but he gave me this gift and I\u2019m so proud of him and so thankful. I miss you, Maurice. ...more Love Is A Mix Tape just absolutely knocked my socks off.

This is ostensibly a book about mix tapes, and looking back at a life spent seeing the world in a series of 45-minute vignettes (then, of course, you flip the tape over). Rob Sheffield has penned an honest (yet wildly entertaining) book that affected me more deeply than any book I've read in recent memory, woven throughout with a genuine and bleeding love for music Love Is A Mix Tape just absolutely knocked my socks off. I devoured this book in one weekend and enjoyed every single page, heartily. This is ostensibly a book about mix tapes, and looking back at a life spent seeing the world in a series of 45-minute vignettes (then, of course, you flip the tape over). Rob Sheffield has penned an honest (yet wildly entertaining) book that affected me more deeply than any book I've read in recent memory, woven throughout with a genuine and bleeding love for music. It's electric. The meta-theme of the book is great love, great loss, and the soundtrack: his relationship and marriage to Renee, a girl who he says was \"in the middle of everything, living her big, messy, epic life, and none of us who loved her will ever catch up with her.\" Rob loved Renee, and chronicles that here beautifully from their first meeting to her sudden death at 31. Parts of the book are evisceratingly intimate. Sometimes I felt almost too close to his darkest and most intimate moments, and it's hard to phrase this right but -- because I knew so much of the music that weaves throughout their stories, I almost felt like I had a personal stake. I kept thinking that it was surprising to find a story so real and honest and intimate when I initially picked this up because, duh, it's about mix tapes. If you don't like reading about other people's love stories, you should still 100% read this book. Renee was his muse, but his passion (and hers) is thoroughly and unabashedly music -- and there is some absolutely fantastic stuff in here. He writes of their relationship, \"We had nothing in common, except we both loved music. It was the first connection we had, and we depended on it to keep us together. We did a lot of work to meet in the middle. Music brought us together.\" They were both music writers and radio DJs, they fell in love hard and married young. They made lots and lots of fabulous mix tapes, and each chapter begins with a reprinted tracklist from one cassette from that era in their lives. This is a man after my own heart. How could I do anything but love a man who starts chapter 14 with: \"Every time I have a crush on a woman, I have the same fantasy: I imagine the two of us as a synth-pop duo.\" He goes on to elaborate how she is in the front (\"tossing her hair, a saucy little firecracker\"), stealing the show and he is hidden in the back behind his Roland JP8000 keyboard, \"lavishing all my computer blue love on her.\"He even lists all the best band names he's come up with for their synth-pop duo: Metropolitan Floors, Indulgence, Angela Dust. And you should hear him wax poetic about mix tapes. Be still my heart. Rob writes, \"There are all kinds of mix tapes. There is always a reason to make one.\" He then gives his examples: The Party Tape I Want You We're Doing It? Awesome! You Like Music, I Like Music, I Can Tell We're Going To Be Friends You Broke My Heart And Made Me Cry and Here Are Twenty or Thirty Songs About It The Road Trip Good Songs From Bad Albums I Never Want To Play Again . . . and many more. \"There are millions of songs in the world,\" he writes, \"and millions of ways to connect them into mixes. Making the connections is part of the fun of being a fan.\" The book starts with Sheffield pulling out a box of old tapes and all throughout the book --from his childhood school dance recollections, to the first mixes he can remember making for Renee, to the ones that accompanied him in the dark days and months following her death-- the mix tapes and the songs are as much characters in this story as the actual people are. Since each of us have our own completely sovereign and self-focused memories surrounding our favorite bands and favorite songs (the unique feelings, smells, companions, activities associated with them), there is something that I just find so ebullient about \"seeing\" all these bands and songs through the unique rubric of their lives. A MUST-READ. ...more I fell head-over-heels in love with this book, just as Rob Sheffield fell hard and fast when he met Renee. The book is their love story, but it's also a love story about music. Each chapter opens with the song list from a mix tape Rob either made or received. It was fun to skim the titles, looking for tracks I had used in my own mix tapes. One of my favorite chapters was when Rob got picked to play the music at his junior high dance. He screwed up big time.

He screwed up big time. He filled his tape with power anthems, which the boys loved, but the girls hated them and wouldn't dance. He said he still had a lot to learn about women. Both Rob and Renee were radio DJs and music writers, and he admits the only thing they had in common was music. Rob even wooed Renee by making her a mix tape, which is included in one of the chapters. I expected this book to be sad because Rob warns us early that his wife died of a pulmonary embolism after only five years of marriage, but the book is very funny and sweet, with only one chapter that was a real tearjerker. By the end, I wished I could have met Renee, who sounds like a firecracker of a Southern gal. But at least I got to hear about her favorite music, which is as close to meeting someone as you can get. Update Aug. 2013: Sheffield has a new book out about his life after his wife died, and it reminded me how much I had loved this memoir. I was glad I gave it five stars when I first read it because I remember it so fondly that I would have been forced to increase it if it wasn't already there. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves music, memoirs or love stories. ...more I didn't really know what this book was about until I started flipping through it last night. I bought it as a last minute, bargain priced add-on from Barnes & Noble, pretty much just to bump up my total to $25 so I could get free shipping. The title caught my eye since making mixtapes took up a lot of time during my teenage years. Seriously, when the iPod was first introduced, I thought it was the greatest invention since the automobile.

The title caught my eye since making mixtapes took up a lot of time during my teenage years. Seriously, when the iPod was first introduced, I thought it was the greatest invention since the automobile. Anyway, I was expecting this to be a humorous, dick-lit type novel, having no idea that Sheffield wrote this memoir after his wife of only 5 years passed away. I read the first page, just to get a feel for it, and didn't put it down until I finished. It was a very quick read, but I loved it. There were parts that I had stinging eyes and a lump in my throat, but was laughing out loud at the same time. The references to nineties music, even the whole nineties era were hilarious, and the chapter on Nirvana was some of the best writing on Kurt Cobain's life and death that I've ever read. I love how Sheffield pointed out how strong an effect music can have on us, especially when dealing with losing someone you love. There's the times when even a favorite song is ruined because hearing it is just too painful...it just makes the situation too real . Other times, it's hearing a new song that you know that person would totally flip for, but knowing they'll never be able to hear it. I think anyone who loves music, lived through the nineties, or has ever lost someone would really enjoy this. I know it was well worth the whopping $3.99 I paid for it. ...more How come, when most authors write about music, they write as if they're trying to sound like scholars of the Pitchfork generation? And how did Rob Sheffield know he should skip all that and write a great book about the intersection of music, tragedy, and everyday existence?

And how did Rob Sheffield know he should skip all that and write a great book about the intersection of music, tragedy, and everyday existence? Love is a Mix Tape is Mr. Sheffield's account of his marriage, wife's death, and the role music played in their lives. The couple were one of those with a musical cute meet (Big Star related, even) and a shared Pavement fanaticism. This book could have gone downhill so quickly. But Mr. Sheffield manages to walk the line between false humility and rock critic verbiage because he sounds, well, like he's talking in a normal voice, very slowly and carefully, about his history. He seems like the kind of person who accessed music to mediate his interactions, so when he gets a girlfriend, gets married, and loses his wife, he contextualizes events and emotions around the music that's playing and the songs passing through his mind. The music and narrative intertwine and emerge raw and heartfelt (and I don't like the word \u201cheartfelt\u201d but the word fits). I hope Mr. Sheffield felt better after he wrote this book because he takes serious, honest risks when, for example, he considers whether or not he should use the word \u201cwidow\u201d or when he describes how he reads at Applebee's because he knows he won't run into any friends at mall restaurants. Sheffield writes like Chuck Klosterman's shy friend at the bar, the one who interjects a comment here and there but doesn't need to dominate the conversation. I'm not surprised Klosterman praises this book on the back jacket; fans of one author most likely are/would be fans of the other. My only problem with Love is a Mix Tape surfaced near the text's end; Sheffield wraps up the narrative too quickly, in my eyes, out of nowhere. But I have new respect for Mr. Sheffield, who I only knew previously from VH-1 list shows (e.g. \u201c40 Top One Hit Wonders\u201d). Sheffield gets the fan's quieter, more personal relationship with music, the kind that gathers most of its power when no one is around, or when only one other person is around and the experience is shared as a manifestation of trust and love. Love is a Mix Tape captures this state in surprising, meaningful ways. ...more Oh man, shucks. I loved this book. I could say that the story arc could have been stronger or that he could have talked about mixtapes more (even though he talked about them a lot, I never get sick of it). But I won't. I don't care about those things. I care that I basically love this book way too much. There are many reasons. 1) I am a sucker for exercises in love and grief, which a lot of this book is--his wife died suddenly after they were married for like 5 years, and most of the book is about h Oh man, shucks.

There are many reasons. 1) I am a sucker for exercises in love and grief, which a lot of this book is--his wife died suddenly after they were married for like 5 years, and most of the book is about how he loves her and music. 1a)He describes her as this sort of girl that's bouncy and adventurous and strong, the kind of girl that I basically assume all boys love, and the great thing is, she's a real person. 2) He is an Irish Catholic. This means he talks about being Irish, likes to wash the dishes, and also it means that he thanks the BVM in his acknowledgments. Thats the Blessed Virgin Mary for those of you not in the know. TIGHT. 3) He has excellent musical taste, by which I mean, really devotedly eclectic. He talks about loving crap pop, and Pavement, and old country music on the radio. Plus, he is talking about a great time in music and mixtapes. At the end of the book, he reflects on how awesome music was during the 90s, because they actually let the indie ppl out to play for a little while. And it's true. Plus some of his mixtape selections made me grin. They include \"Don't Worry Baby\", \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", Prince, Liz Phair, Sleater-Kinney's \" Little Babies\", \"Famous Blue Raincoat\", and just generally a lot of stuff that reminds me of listening to the radio at about age 14 , which, all told, wasn't such a bad age. It may not be your cup of tea, but it sure was mine. Mixtapes forevs. ...more I didn't like this as much as others have seemed to. And what I liked most was probably what others discarded--I liked hearing about the signifcance of all the songs and mixes and bands. But the love story? Sap-tastic and hit-me-over-the-head-repetitive. Every tenth line of the first long chapter is heavy foreshadowing mixed with hipster melodrama--you know, \"That music changed my life. But Renee was my life. And then my life went away.\" Then something like \"Love isn't like a cassingle. It's lik I didn't like this as much as others have seemed to.

But Renee was my life. And then my life went away.\" Then something like \"Love isn't like a cassingle. It's like a mixed CD. And my and Renee's hearts were mixed with an A and a B side. And then she broke.\" Or WHATEVER. A lot of cutesy little details are repeated throughout the book, too, and I wondered if the book had originally been published as a series of columns (it wasn't, as far as I can tell). Finally, just to be a real grouch, the author seems to have a type--he describes all his girlfriends and his beloved (dead? did you hear?) wife the same: from the South, pie-baking, punk-riot, energetic, dyed-red hair, music-loving, extrovert. So I never quite got why Renee stuck out so much. ...more Opening line: \"The playback: late night, Brooklyn, a pot of coffee, and a chair by the window. I'm listening to a mix tape from 1993.\" Before I-pods and ripped CDs we all made mix tapes. I'm sure most of us over a certain age still have them safely hidden away somewhere, never quite having had the nerve to throw them out (broken cases and all) We named these tapes, gave them away to friends or lovers and assigned them different purposes.

Remember the break-up tape, the I'm so infatuated with you tape, the party tape, workout tape, road trip tape, stolen off the radio tape etc, etc. It took hours to create a mix tape, attempting to get the songs in perfect order without cutting off the last one. Now imagine, nearly 20 years later having the courage to scour through and listen to all those tapes again. The joy of rediscovery, the nostalgia, the OMG I forgot all about that song which reminds me of that party/girl/boy/car moment. You might also experience pain or sadness over that long lost love. Well this is what LOVE IS A MIX TAPE is all about. I absolutely adored this book. Rob Sheffield style of writing is so honest, natural and funny that you'll feel like your talking with an old friend. He manages too capture the spirit of the 90's perfectly too as he tells a moving autobiographical account of his years spent with wife Renee. Anyone who lived through that time and is into pop culture will find something relatable here. This is also a tragic love story and on the very first page we learn that Renee has died, we just don't know how or why. We then flash back to the time to before they met as Rob experiences an awkward adolescence and discovers his love of Indie rock. One night Rob meets the sweet Southern girl of his dreams and although only 25 they soon marry. It's not a perfect marriage however; they're broke most of the time, they fight, they get a dog, they drink Zima (remember Zima?) but they always listen to music as one. Rob and Renee ultimately get 7 years together and even though I knew that Renee was going to die when it actually happened I was left stunned. Sheffield depicts the ache of new love and utter helplessness of losing it beautifully and following Rob through the next grief stricken chapters was at times hard to take. Throughout this story it is always about the music and each chapter begins with a dated mix tape complete with side A/B track listings. Some of the tapes were made by Renee others by Rob but you're sure to have a lot of moments remembering your own life's soundtrack as you journey along with the music. You might even find a couple of new favourites. Cheers. ...more I really wanted to like this book, despite my mild dislike for Sheffield's writing in Rolling Stone magazine. While the story is heartbreaking -- he becomes a widower earlier than anyone should be allowed to -- I was expecting much more insight than what's provided in this slim tome (I read it in one sitting.) The story boils down to this -- music nerd from Boston meets awesome Appalachian girl who is everything he isn't. You know where the story is heading after he is instantly smitten when she I really wanted to like this book, despite my mild dislike for Sheffield's writing in Rolling Stone magazine. While the story is heartbreaking -- he becomes a widower earlier than anyone should be allowed to -- I was expecting much more insight than what's provided in this slim tome (I read it in one sitting.) The story boils down to this -- music nerd from Boston meets awesome Appalachian girl who is everything he isn't. You know where the story is heading after he is instantly smitten when she is the only other person in a University of Virginia bar to recognize that Big Star's second album is playing. They make a connection and later, much to his surprise, they fall in love and get married. After his wife is tragically taken away from him he spends the final half of the book telling the reader over and over to the point of irritation how awesome his wife was. While each chapter begins with a playlist of a mix tape he or his wife had made, Sheffield doesn't write enough about the songs on the tapes. Why did he select certain songs over others? What makes a good tape. For a man who made tapes for such mundane chores as washing the dishes and walking the dogs, it's a cop-out not to write about the music itself. Of course, that may not be a bad thing. You would think that someone who writes for Rolling Stone would have high standards for determining what makes a good song. Not Sheffield. To him, all music is great, from the Replacements to Journey to the J. Geils Band. Makes you wonder how he wound up writing for a national magazine. Unfortunately we never learn because Sheffield is too busy telling how awesome his wife was. I wanted at least some idea of how he climbed out of his grief to become a columnist for one of the most storied music magazines in the country. Sheffield likes to liberally sprinkle his writing with pop culture references as a way to show cool and ironic he is, and this book is no exception. While sometimes the references make you smile, most of the time they come off like the junior high social outcast who tries to show how hip he is by making jokes about the Dukes of Hazzard or Star Trek. ...more I started reading this book during the two-day buffer between the beginnings of both 2012 proper and the working year, thinking that I\u2019d have to look no farther than the other end of the couch if the story really destroyed me to the point of needing my myriad mostly-under-control-but-always-threatening-to-surface spousal fears allayed by husbandly hugs.

Turns out, catching up on laundry and tidying up our soon-to-be-vacated first home ate into my reading time and I wound up finishing this about an hour after hubs left for work. (Luckily, this book wasn't the sob-fest I was fearing, which is a huge point for the \"pro\" column.) But you know what? That lost solitary reading time was put to good use. Hubs and I giggled our way through the brutal minute-long walk to the laundry room, encountered a comedy of errors while corralling our smallclothes and turned vacuuming into a contact sport. And I think that, more than actually sitting down with \u201cLove is a Mix Tape,\u201d helped drive home the unspoken point of the book, which is that you never know how much time you'll have with someone so you'd better make the most of the present. Every time I\u2019ve seen Rob Scheffield waxing eloquent about music on television, he always seems to have this goofy grin and be a generally amiable person, an image which I\u2019m sure is aided by how not pretentious he is about the music he loves (that's admittedly foreign territory to me). We can all agree that a personable demeanor is unusual for a rock critic and an avid connoisseur of music, right? Because you should believe everything you see on TV, I assumed he was a happy-go-lucky dude who just truly loves and is animated by music. So imagine my surprise when I realized there\u2019s a heart-rending tale under all of that. This isn\u2019t a prettied-up-for-mass-consumption account of an individual's personal tragedy that is just, like, so super unique and deserving of publication because the author said so, thank God. It\u2019s about Rob. It\u2019s about other things, too, of course \u2013 music being chief among them \u2013 but mostly how they\u2019ve left distinct and indelible marks on Rob\u2019s persona. Renee gets a lot of mention, but she\u2019s a living, thriving presence for most of the book. The reader wouldn\u2019t get the full extent of the things that made Renee so magnetic if this was another pity-party strutting its stuff for affirmations of the author\u2019s suffering. Instead, Rob displays enough of his late wife\u2019s traits and habits to make us understand her without betraying all of her secrets. We see Renee through Rob\u2019s eyes: She\u2019s flawed but good-hearted, quirky but grounded, an individual who\u2019s bubbling over with life. It is so obvious that Rob is still smitten with Renee and probably has been since their first encounter. And it\u2019s obvious that his love is motivated by who she is as a whole rather than what she represents to him. For someone with so little relationship experience, like Rob, that kind of selflessness is nigh impossible to either understand or execute. But you can tell that this boy is just wild about his girl by the way she\u2019s framed within the book. A memoir like this should be more of a tribute and less of a fishbowl therapy session, and it should exist to deliver a message rather than parade the author's personal tragedies in morbid self-congratulation; thankfully, this one rises above the usual credibility-killing narcissistic pitfalls. There are no excessive displays of grief and Rob doesn't rely on his wife's death as the storytelling vehicle, as either would be disrespectful to Rob and Renee\u2019s short-lived union. Rob mourns his wife, of course, accepts that he\u2019ll never be rewarded for dealing with his widower status by getting to have Renee back, and spends an appropriate amount of time in the fetal position, but he does so with dignity. He doesn\u2019t want to wallow in self pity or spend night after lonely night in a cemetery because to do so would be to succumb to a dismissal of Renee\u2019s joie de vivre , which was clearly one of her defining attributes. There were definite divisions marking life before, during and after Renee, which certainly helped the story find a universally applicable element, but it\u2019s Rob\u2019s love of music that gives this books its strongest framework. Just like there was life with and without Renee, there\u2019s music before and after Renee, too. For every milestone, be it as a child or a grieving adult, there\u2019s a song or album or band to serve as the soundtrack. What is music\u2019s greatest purpose if not to act as a personalized landscape for each individual, after all? As someone who went through a rabidly elitist phase of music consumption (a phase that has, fortunately, waned over the years but still needs to assert its lingering presence at the least appropriate times) and is drawn to those who\u2019ve traveled a similar path, I feel pretty confident in saying that the least musically talented music aficionados aren\u2019t the most accepting folks. It\u2019s easy to scoff at pop music and the bands who create it but Rob doesn\u2019t fall victim to this. He admits to secretly loving some disco ditties as a teenager and accepts his phases of enjoying some truly craptastic tunes. The mix tapes\u2019 track listings that open each chapter illustrate that he never really let go of that open-mindedness, which make his honesty and vulnerability regarding other facets of his life that much more credible. He doesn\u2019t limit himself to the music that\u2019s peripherally cool or only listen to what the radio spoon-feeds him, which, to me, demonstrated an unabashed affinity for all music, much to his credit. One of the points that Rob subtly made was that when two people are just as sick about music as they are about each other, music gradually becomes a third entity in the relationship. Having that life raft of shared music (and, later, music he wishes he could share with Renee) is what kept the intimacy of his late wife close and, as I saw it, kept Rob from totally coming unglued. It always seemed like he knew he\u2019d soldier on without his other half, but music seemed to be what kept propelling him forward, however stumblingly or reluctantly. Music does emerge as the real hero and great unifier when it comes to the crux of the story, though the quiet messages of human kindness and self-discovery serve as its moral. I held myself together through Rob\u2019s accounts of Renee\u2019s death and funeral and his mourning period; what finally pierced my groggy heart was Rob\u2019s awe over complete strangers\u2019 acts of kindness toward him. I\u2019m a sucker for the moment the veil of cynicism is lifted (probably because I\u2019m pretty certain humanity comprises a bunch of selfish jerks and, therefore, get all warm and gooey when someone can convince me otherwise for a little while), and Rob\u2019s realization that he can\u2019t go back to his former skepticism over the goodness of people was a defining moment of the story. Yes, there is some goodness in the world: It just took a world-shattering tragedy for Rob to gain some firsthand knowledge of it. Human kindness helped him to move on while pointing out the places where some silver lining is peeking through. It is hard to write about a loved one\u2019s sudden death without summoning every cheaply sentimental cop-out to prey on the audience\u2019s emotions, so Rob gets all kinds of kudos for offering up a good read rather than a cloying trick. This is a beautiful remembrance of a well-loved someone while doubling as a love letter to the music that will always be there through the highest highs, lowest lows and every small moment or long car ride between. ...more \"\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0442\u0430 \u0435 \u0441\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\"

Although this may be a scary concept that many avoid talking about, it is this reality that will set us on our path to enjoying these precious moments to the max. In the memoir, Love is a Mix Tape by Rob Sheffield, this concept of losing love and enjoying what you have while you have it is shown through the musically bonded love of two music journalist, Rob Life is filled with the most beautiful moments one can imagine but these beautiful moments could also end in some of the most painful times. Although this may be a scary concept that many avoid talking about, it is this reality that will set us on our path to enjoying these precious moments to the max. In the memoir, Love is a Mix Tape by Rob Sheffield, this concept of losing love and enjoying what you have while you have it is shown through the musically bonded love of two music journalist, Rob and Renee. Even though reading this memoir really had its impact on me, I don't believe this book should be mandatory for a high school readers to read, but should definitely be offered independently for its ability to grab the interest and hearts of the reader and give life to the idea of loving something as much as you can while you can. In this memoir by Rob Sheffield, through Rob\u2019s original love for music he falls in love with love true love of his life, his wife Renee. After a short five years into their lives together married, Renee suddenly passes away on Mothers Day 1997. When looking back on his life and time spent with Renee, Rob is able to use their mix tapes they have created over the years to show the love they shared. Through songs by some of the, most famous bands who have ever lived these mixtapes show small things like their time spent cooking together in the kitchen to the time Rob spent in deep grievance, all alone after the loss of his wife. These mix tape that are quoted throughout the book are much more than just words to show their lives together, they symbolize a special moment in a specific time in Rob\u2019s life. The idea of living life to the fullest and loving every moment of it can be seen by a man who can no longer love these moment when he says, \u201cOur lives were just beginning, our favorite moment was right now, our favorite songs were unwritten.\u201d Now that Rob has lost the love of his life he is unable to live for a more beautiful tomorrow and shows that he was at least able to make every moment the best moment of his life. The life lesson to be taken from this beautiful memoir has little to do with any educational values but a lot to do with personal experiences. This is specifically why I would recommend this book to be used by high schools more as an optional read because once this book is picked up it will be hard for the student to put it back down. Also, the lesson about living and loving what you are going through and have at this moment is cherish-able and important for any age group. Although a scary thought, we may have the world today but tomorrow we might not have a single thing so take the time now to cherish and enjoy it. ...more spoiler: she dies i'm feeling a lot of love, life & loss right now, so i thought, \"What The Hell, Give It A Shot.\" and, well, this could be the hipster love story of the year... possibly that of the decade. littered with gratuitous references to the music of the 1990s, the uncensored grief of a sensitive hetero dude, the life of a quirky, curvy girl tragically cut short by an unexpected pulmonary embolism, all delivered straight from the keyboard of a Rolling Stone editor -- this book tallies spoiler: she dies i'm feeling a lot of love, life & loss right now, so i thought, \"What The Hell, Give It A Shot.\" and, well, this could be the hipster love story of the year... possibly that of the decade. littered with gratuitous references to the music of the 1990s, the uncensored grief of a sensitive hetero dude, the life of a quirky, curvy girl tragically cut short by an unexpected pulmonary embolism, all delivered straight from the keyboard of a Rolling Stone editor -- this book tallies up enough points to keep it on the \"fave books\" list for many socialite myspace pages for years to come. okay! okay! i admit it! i boo-hooed, sobbed, snorted snot, and positively wept through entire chapters of this book! i read it out-loud to my sweetheart, choking every few words and probably providing a nearly unintelligible listening experience (she did not complain). however, this was not much of an accomplishment cause im a big ol tittybaby who loves to cry all day! i cry when puppies wrestle because it is so sweet, okay?! i read the whole damn thing aloud! it was so hard to read it out loud while i was crying! so, anyway, enough about my emotional shortcomings. it was contrived mostly, but i enjoyed the 90s nostalgia and the tragic saccharine tone. i was always been a sucker for the ill-fated romance, wasn't i? the book did freak me out A LOT because rob & renee met one day before krista and i did (september 17 and september 18, respectively) and they got married the same day we did (july 13 --- by the way! i got gay-married!). also, renee was the same age (26) that i was when we got married. does this mean, uhm, that i'm going to die in five years of a pulmonary embolism at my sewing machine? not that long ago, i would have said HERE'S HOPING, FOLKS ! but actually, i guess only time will tell, and frankly, i hope not because i have a lot of shit to do. fortunately the book doesnt take itself so seriously so i dont think it has to stand as an foreshadowing omen of my death. recommended: if you are bored and looking for an indie rock hetero love story set in the 1990s; if you cant get enuff romance from the pages of rolling stone but you love their style; if you wish you had found and lost the greatest love of your lifetime; warning: if you think you already HAVE found and lost the greatest love of your lifetime, this might just hit you *right there* maybe not in a good way. xoxxx ...more Now I know someone likes making mix tapes (and by extension mix cds) as much as I do.

And, like Sheffield, I think my generation of music - the color and creativity, the upbeat rhythms, the high-road empathy, THE FUN - is better than any other generation, especially the whiny-ness and muffled emptiness of a lot of 90s fare. We all knew life sucked. That's why we spent so much time walking like Egyptians. The writing here is open, conversational, too-the-point and surprisingly funny. Sheffield doesn't let us get to know his wife, Renee, too well, as if he needs to keep a lot of the details to himself. Fair enough. His enthusiasm for music is not quite as limited: \"Every time I have a crush on a woman, I have the same fantasy: I imagine the two of us as a synth-pop duo. No matter who she is, or how we meet, the synth-pop duo fantasy has to work, or the crush fizzles out. I have loads of other musical fantasies about my crushes--I picture us as a Gram-and-Emmylou country harmony duo, or as guitarists in a rock band, trading off vocals like Mick and Keith. But for me, it always comes back to the synth-pop duo. The girl is up front, swishing her skirt, tossing her hair, a saucy little firecracker. I'm the boy in the back, hidden behind my Roland JP8000 keyboard.\" Sheffield works literary wonders in describing the depth of his love for Renee, which gives the book a aching, vulnerable depth while he describes his appreciation for what is sometimes lighter and funnier musical choices, like Chaka Khan's \"I Feel for You\" or Tone Loc's \"Funky Cold Medina\". On the other hand, Renee is a lighter, funnier person, someone who frequently celebrates life or makes those around her feel more comfortable. In the end, I think of this as a brave book. Brave in how Sheffield remembers Renee, brave for being so unabashedly enthusiastic about the music we hear on our radios. I didn't know most of the songs, and I want a more detailed, chronological description of their relationship. In short, I wanted to get into this book more. The author had me at \"Hello\". ...more This is the kind of memoir I'd like to have written (albeit without the deceased wife).

So what song is both a. short enough to fit, and b. the perfect statement of my feelings? And then there was the planning for the sequence of the mix's sides.

Quotable moments: But most of all, I regret turning thirteen, and staying that way for the next ten years or so. At any wedding we attend, my family is the problem table, the one everyone gradually drifts away from out of self-preservation. It's a proud family tradition. Now this was our wedding, and nobody could stop us. Giving us a crate of champagne and a dance floor was like handing a madman the keys to a 747 and saying, \"Now, seriously, dude, don't crash it. Promise?\" My friends and I assumed that we would be tenured professors, which is an excellent life goal--it's like planning to be Cher. Dog love is blind. For that matter, dog love is stupid. As soon as they hit the stage, you could hear all the girls in the crowd ovulate in unison. You lose a certain kind of innocence when you experience this type of kindness. You lose your right to be a jaded cynic. I was helpless in trying to return people's kindness, but also helpless to resist it. Kindness is a scarier force than cruelty, that's for sure. Cruelty isn't that hard to understand. I had no trouble comprehending why the phone company wanted to screw me over; they just wanted to steal some money, it was nothing personal. That's the way of the world. It made me mad, but it didn't make me feel stupid. If anything, it flattered my intelligence. Accepting all that kindness, though, made me feel stupid. The way I pictured it, all this grief would be like a winter night when you're standing outside. You'll warm up once you get used to the cold. Except after you've been out there a whole, you feel the warmth draining out of you and you realize the opposite is happening; you're getting colder and colder, as the body heat you brought outside with you seeps out of your skin. Instead of getting used to it, you get weaker the longer you endure it. Each side of a tape goes on for forty-five minutes, and then comes to a stop, allowing a chance for somebody to discreetly change the music, whereas a mix CD has only one side. Which means it goes on for eighty minutes, and you can't turn it off halfway through without offering some sort of lame excuse, such as \"Garth is singing about cocaine in this song and it's bad for the baby,\" or \"Dave Matthews is mixing violin solos with saxophone solos and it's bad for the baby.\" Sometimes great tunes happen to bad times, and when the bad time is over, not all the tunes get to move on with you. According to the Western philosopher Pat Benatar, love is a battlefield. Her paisan Frank Sinatra would add the corollary that love is a tender trap... Love hurts. Love stinks. Love bites, love bleeds, love is a drug. The troubadours of our times all agree: They want to know what love is, and they want you to show them. But the answer is simple: Love is a mix tape. ...more I'm so excited about discovering Rob Sheffield, I can't even begin to tell you.

For the first time in years, I didn't find about the book on websites, blogs, magazines or friend recommendations, I just stumbled upon it and decided I wanted to read it. OK, truth be told, it was his other book, Talking to Girls About Duran Duran One Young Man's Quest for True Love and a Cooler Haircut that caught my eye first, but however... I never made a mix tape. Because I was never into making them, you know, the time and effort put into selecting the songs, plus I don't think I owned enough music to do that, or the equipment. But I had mix tapes made for me, and I still remember songs from those cassettes, and later I had mix CDs made for me, and I might still have some CDs my husband made for me years ago, when he wasn't even my boyfriend and I listened to them and tried to figure out how he was like and the whatnot. OK, so I really liked the book and I took it to Twitter to let Rob know that. (Stalk much?) I just needed him to know that I do remember KLF's Justified and Ancient, because in the 9th grade one of my colleagues was obsessed with it. And while I'm here, I might just say that I'll probably never see music with the same eyes again, since I tend to be so picky when it comes to it, like for instance I would have never listened to JT voluntarily because he's from *NSYNC, but I saw him on SNL a few weeks ago and was so blown by his performance of \"Mirrors\" that I played it over and over and made my husband watch it and kept asking him about it, like isn't it awesome? So yeah, I'm listening to JT's album as I write, because music and musicians are so versatile and our tastes change and evolve in years, since I know for sure there are bands or singers I wouldn't have listened to in my teens that I just love now. Like Prince or some of the '90s bands I found so annoying at the time. That's it. I need to do the dishes. P.S. If you liked High Fidelity or Just Kids , you're probably going to enjoy this as well. ...more If you've lost someone that you cared deeply for you know the frustration in not being able to express who that person was to others.

The on going loss that comes from meeting new people and knowing they will never know this person (this HUGE part of your life) can seem crippling at times. In some ways this book appears to be Sheffields attempt to make his wife known to us after her very early death. Personally, I don't think he succeeded. His short lived marriage to her seemed sweet in a teen angel kind of way but the essence of who she was or the connection didn't feel more unique than any number of early crushes, relationships people experience. The fact that they married early and only had 5 years together as a husband and wife together before seemed glaringly obvious in his idolized, frequently cliche ramblings of her. His writing about the music itself outweighed his attention to the point he had initially started with and there were at least 2 chapters that seemed entirely unnecessary, if not distracting. Frequently his writing appeared to be designed more for a beer commercial than a book, when speaking to his affinity for mixed tapes he says, \" ....The times you lived through, the people you shared those times with - nothing brings it all to life like an old mix tape\". It's hard for me to read that sentence, however true it may be, without imagining a swimming pool, coolers of beer and bikini clad woman. And yet! Three stars because I loved the chapter when he reminisced his pubescent attempts at making mixed tapes for parties! I loved his reflections on what music meant to girls vs. boys. And lets be honest I loved reminiscing about all my sappy, happy and/or crappy mixes of the past. ...more *so many feelings* Okay, so this review is pretty much going to be a tribute to the 90's and I'll-tell-you-my-feelings-you-tell-me-yours sort of thing, SO all non touchy-feely persons, exit right.

I love everything about this decade- be it the irrational exuberance, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, The Lion King, My So-Called Life, listening to music on cassette tapes, the music itself, growing up without Facebook or the internet etcetera etcetera.

Screaming guitars, screechy angsty vocals, flannel shirts, greasy hair sans the hair products, flipping the bird to stupid societal conformations....Aaaah! I LURVE LURVE GRUNGE with such a flaming passion that it could burn all the coal reserves in the world. And I love making playlists. I have a playlist for almost every feeling I experience- when I'm a sappy duck (the 'Kiss Me Till I'm Love Drunk' playlist), when I'm feeling like a creep (the'Icky Shit' playlist), when I'm feeling wrist slitty (the 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die' playlist), when I'm going for a walk/run (the 'Crank It Up, Bitch' playlist), when I'm feeling super angsty (the'Don't Need Your Atti-fuckin'-tude' playlist), when a boy breaks my heart (the'You Broke My Heart and Made Me Cry So I Made a Playlist About It' playlist), playlist with songs that make my aural senses go into a coma (the'Ear Porn' playlist) and so on. Why did I love this book so much? Because. ..because it grabbed my spirit by the throat and beat it bloody (okay that sounds utterly sadomasochistic). WHAT I mean is that at some basic level, this book really touched me. Maybe because that's how I imagine my life to be six years from now (minus a dead spouse). You know, fresh out of college, not having a high flying executive job, bumming around, living impulsively, eating and breathing music. And books. I want to be wasted. Not on drugs but on the joy living life exactly the way you want brings. I can relate so much to Rob and his wife Renee that it almost borders on creepy. \"She worried way too much what people thought of her, wore her heart on her sleeve, expected too much from people, and got hurt too easily. She kept other people\u2019s secrets like a champ, but told her own too fast. She expected the world not to cheat her and was always surprised when it did. She had more ideas than she had time to finish. She worried a lot about whether she was good enough.\" So in a way, the book opened old wounds. And poured salt on them. I liked that all the chapters started with a mix tape featuring some of my favorite artists, I might add. So it was a happy feeling to know that songs that affect me affect other people in a similar way. And the moment when you go Ohmysweetgoodness how did I possibly live so much of my life without that song? It's insanely intoxicating- like, finding some lost piece of you that you didn't even know was missing. And awww they named their dog Duane Allman. How cute. No it's tacky. Cuz it's a she. One complain though, Mr Sheffield, Y U B hating on Pearl Jam? D': \"I realize it\u2019s frowned on to choose a mate based on something superficial like the music they love. But superficiality has been good to me.\" Or books. Every time I have a crush on a boy, I have the same fantasy (aside from the one about making out in the library)- I imagine the two of us doing a kickass rock duet (preferably Drain You but I'm always open to suggestions). Every. Single. Fucking. Time. So why the four stars you ask? Because I'm bitter. This book hit too close to home that for a moment I lost the ability to breathe and I was sitting stumped.

Using the above as a backdrop, Sheffield mixes in his love of music in general, and his love of mix tapes in particular, to show how much he loved his wife, and later, to show how music was a coping mechanism for him. Both he and his wife were crazy about music. When they first started to court they made mix tapes for each other. Music helped reinforce their love for each other. I found that the common love they shared through music beautiful and powerful. There are some quotable gems in this book where Sheffield uses music to highlight a memory, or a feeling, or a way of looking at the world that is utterly profound. Some of these gems I put in the updates for the book. These alone make this book worthwhile. To top it off, Sheffield is a very talented writer. For all of that, I did find it a bit uneven. Sheffield knows A LOT of popular culture besides music, and I found some of his metaphors and examples confusing. I do think this book may of been therapeutic for him, so there is some license for tangents. Overall, a very beautiful book. It is a sad book, which didn't bother me, and there is great insight here, even in it's unevenness. Recommended. ...more Anybody who grew up in the 80s and 90s remembers making mix tapes.

He tells the story of his life with his first true love, Renee, a rocker chick from the hills of Appalachia who fell in love with and married a tall, stringy, music loving geek. Despite their differences, they always had music. And several moments in their life together were captured in the form of mix tapes. The story is poignant, funny, endearing, and heartwrenching all at once. Sheffield writes with a keen insight into the music industry and the lives of these bands that he and his wife loved together. But what\u2019s even more amazing than just reading about their life is how this memoir took me back to those periods in my own life as well. I was reliving my own memories as I was reading his.

BRAVO! ...more I really expected to like this book, so I'm a bit disappointed to have to give it so few stars. I just wasn't into his writing style. I was moved by the story and the idea of seeing love and loss through a mixtape, but I really did not like him as a storyteller. His treatment of dialogue felt particularly awkward. Sorry to all the fans out there, but I found this one unimpressive. A music critic's valentine to rock music and the unique way it can embody our best and worst moments in a few pithy notes or verses. There's the music that plays when he falls in love, the music that fills their young wedded lives, and then the music that sustains him when he suddenly inexplicably loses her. 90s music knowledge helps, but anyone who's ever said to someone, \"This song explains it better than I can\" and pressed play (inadvertently channeling Cameron Crowe) would enjoy this book. Let's get one thing straight right here, right now; Robby doesn't know a thing about making a mix tape. And this quickly becomes a metaphor for what he knows about writing books. I understand that mix tapes are a rather personal preference. Even though I was gnashing my teeth through the first couple of chapters, I managed to tell myself that, hey, not everyone has a rule about not repeating the same artists on mix tapes. After all, the more you repeat an artist on a mix tape, the less a \"mix\" Let's get one thing straight right here, right now; Robby doesn't know a thing about making a mix tape.

Even though I was gnashing my teeth through the first couple of chapters, I managed to tell myself that, hey, not everyone has a rule about not repeating the same artists on mix tapes. After all, the more you repeat an artist on a mix tape, the less a \"mix\" it is. So Robby's not very creative, no big deal, right? That's about the time I got to the chapter that featured a mix tape that started off with four Fleetwood Mac songs in a row. THAT IS NOT A MIX TAPE! At that point, you're making a \"greatest hits\" collection, with a few other songs thrown on to fill it out. Wow! I've been carrying that around since I finished this worthless turd! My soul feels cleansed. There's plenty I didn't like about this book, but his desecration of the art of mix-taping, especially considering the book's title, marks it up as a major faux pas. As far as the rest of it goes... with one or two exceptions, there has never been anyone who's written for Rolling Stone that didn't have their head up their own ass to a certain extent, and Robby is no exception. One of the most glaring examples is when he brags about riding on a bus with Linkin Park. Jeezum Crow, I really look at you as one erudite motherfucker now! Did you eat tacos with Creed, too? Another example is the elitist supposition that the reader is expected to be familiar with some musical minutiae that only a Rolling Stone writer would be privy to. \"You know the Johnny Paycheck song 'My Beard and My Butt'.\" No, Robby, I don't, because Johnny Paycheck is, at best, a footnote in the history of country music. So why would I, or most of the people reading this book, be expected to know an obscure number by a musician whose only claim to fame is the novelty song chestnut \"Take This Job and Shove It\"? Being a music fan, this would all be enough to give this sucker the ol' heave-ho. But I'm going to guess that there are some readers that don't share my... let's be kind and say \"obsession\", shall we? Unfortunately, there isn't much else to this book. The characters come off as rather stiff and the dialogue sounds as if it's from a poorly-written sitcom. Surprising, since you would expect someone writing a memoir to be able to translate the passion of what they lived through. What it comes down to is that Robby and I are both \"of a certain age\". I suppose my expectation was that this book would offer some sort of insight into the Gen X milieu we were both birthed out of, something that Nick Hornby did so poignantly and effortlessly in High Fidelity. In its place is a weepy memoir about the dead wife of an author I feel no connection to or sympathy for. At least Robby didn't have to suffer through the inevitable divorce that was on the horizon. A guy who doesn't like dogs, the Who and Vanity Fare's \"Hitchin' a Ride\" can't be all bad, can he? Yes. Yes he can. ...more any memoir that references the band Pavement as a touchstone band in their lives is off to a pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. humorous, endearing, witty pop culture references, the book definitely checked off some boxes. and while this wasn't the most perfect book from cover to cover, it still managed to be highly evocative to me in terms of the role that music plays in my life and my relationships. At the same time, it's also a very endearing love letter to the author's wife.

At the same time, it's also a very endearing love letter to the author's wife. My husband thought the writing kind of obnoxious because he happened to open to a random page where Sheffield said that everything Jeff Beck did after the Yardbirds sucked (or something like that) and totally disagreed. But he more than anyone ought to know that music (and music writing, as Sheffield is a longtime Rolling Stone writer) is highly subjective. I liked that Sheffield was an unabashed lover of pop music and the oldies as well as the always revolving roster of cool bands. and of course I was going to love a book with a fair amount of Superchunk, Sonic Youth and Pavement references. but I also loved how the book reminded me of my own moments with mix tapes: a friendship from high school that mattered more than I knew at the time was based on mix tapes, a summer friend from my farm stand days who I exchanged mix tapes with. my best friend and all the mix tapes and music we've loved together over twenty-eight years (whoa). and of course, my husband and all the music we've exchanged since our first days together when I first mastered the massive CD-burning machine at Fox. yeah i gave this book three stars, but that's not such a bad thing. the book, and this review for that matter, is for anyone for whom music plays a central role in their lives (and it would certainly help if you grew up in the nineties too). ...more This book broke my heart. I cried several times reading this book. I think it hit a little too close to home in some aspects. This idea of being connected to one person through music and that forming a base for your relationship and the growing into a beautiful love - that hit home. The book is about Rob, and how he met his wife - Renee - and the all too soon moment of her death. The interesting part is that he tells this story through mix tapes.

This idea of being connected to one person through music and that forming a base for your relationship and the growing into a beautiful love - that hit home. The book is about Rob, and how he met his wife - Renee - and the all too soon moment of her death. The interesting part is that he tells this story through mix tapes. A tape they played while driving, a tape they played to get them to sleep. Their relationship is beautifully mapped by all these songs that signify key points. Their relationship, the way he described Renee was sublime, she was kooky and fun and noisy and her character danced right off the pages in a home-made mod dress and their love flowed off the pages too, giving you that warm feeling inside. Each chapter is started with a different mix tape, and these songs, maybe not all of them, appear in the chapter, with a nod in thanks to them for being there at the right time. Some mix tapes are Rob's, some are ones his friends made him, some are Renee's, but they're all different, not just for their musical content but for where in life they represent. This book is about using music as a rock. Using music to lean on when things are too hard, life is unfair and you're left all alone, in shock and not knowing what to do. It's about getting through something excruciatingly tough with music - and how music changes when a tragedy happens - some songs you just can't listen to any more. I'd give this book to any of my friends who have ever used music to get them through something tough, even if it was just a bad day. This book is a reminded of the power and beauty of music in life and love. ...more I have played in bands. I have released albums and played all kinds of venues big and small. I've even worked at clubs. Most of my friends that have been around for the long run are people I met through music. Despite this, I still don't get those music obsessed guys like Rob Sheffield. Music is great, but it's always been more of the background incidental music for me than the central focus. It's hard to relate to someone who makes something like music the central focus of his life. \"Love is a I have played in bands. I have released albums and played all kinds of venues big and small.

Music is great, but it's always been more of the background incidental music for me than the central focus. It's hard to relate to someone who makes something like music the central focus of his life. \"Love is a Mix Tape\" reads a lot like a memoir version of \"High Fidelity\" but the former is a lot less self-aware than the latter. Sheffield talks about his teen years, meeting his wife and her early death. He contextualizes these life experiences by talking about mix tapes he made or was given at the time of these events. There are some funny moments, especially when Sheffield cops to having liked some truly embarrassing stuff. The sort of \"what was I thinking\" kind of bad music that nearly everyone else would deny ever having tapped a food to. These moments aren't enough to keep the book afloat. The courting and marriage to his wife is just too cute and cliched to be anything other than eye roll inducing. What kills the book unfortunately is the last chapter when Sheffield truly goes off the rails trying to talk about what the 90s meant and what the music of the 90s meant. While the 90s had some interesting stuff going on, he completely overstates the importance of music to the total picture. It starts to sound like he believes a lot of the rock music critic garbage that was spewed about bands like Nirvana and other trends of the 90s. Sheffield is a long time rock critic for Rolling Stone and his observations start to sound as dated and out of touch as that magazine. ...more<---C>Rob Sheffield</---C><+++>Love Is a Mix Tape</+++>", "Title": "Love Is a Mix Tape"},
