The Professor, who was in the process of calibrating what looked like a complex optical instrument, welcomed them effusively. \"Randolph! Miles! Lindsay! Darby! Chick! How wonderful to see you!\" He gave Pugnax's head a pat, receiving a friendly growl of recognition from the canine savant, and exchanged manly handshakes with the others. \"So what have you been up to,<---M> Doc?\" asked Randolph</---M>, the greetings completed. \"Your wireless telegraph message sounded most intriguing.<---F> Something about a</---F>... book?\" \"Indeed, indeed,\" said the Professor, hardly able to contain his habitual enthusiasm. \"And what a book! We have had our setbacks with the temporal displacement unit, I am the first to admit it, but this time it is 'the real deal'. Feast your eyes on this!\" As he gestured towards the scientific device with which he had been occupied, apparently some kind of microscope, the Chums were surprised to notice that it was trained on an open volume. The Professor carefully unfastened the clamps and handed it to Randolph. \" <+++>Against the Day</+++> , a novel by <---A>Thomas Pynchon</---A>,\" exclaimed the intrepid aeronaut as he studied the flyleaf. \"Published in... 2007?!\" \"Quite so, quite so,\" murmured the Professor. \"By far our most successful experiment to date. Nearly a whole century forward. Please, read on!\" The other Chums crowded around their leader and peered over his shoulder as he turned the pages. There certainly were a great many of them. \"I can't make head or tail of it,\" admitted Randolph after a few minutes of study. \"All these... mathematical equations...\" \"Long sentences,\" added Chick. \"And foreign words,\" concluded Darby. \"It is, indeed, something of a challenge,\" said the Professor. \"But, as you will no doubt remember, literary theory has long been a passion of mine. I remain convinced that, with suitable mechanical aids, even the most recondite screed will happily yield up its--\" He broke off in mid-sentence; from the glances being exchanged between Randolph and Miles, it was all too clear that they had not yet forgotten their unfortunate encounter with the Pansensual Gerty MacDowell Experience (see The Chums of Chance and the Jujubes of Joyce ). But after a moment of hesitation, he continued, ignoring his young friends' skeptical expressions. \"I have studied the text carefully,\" said the Professor. \"It soon becomes clear that the theme of mirroring is of central importance. Reflections and twins abound. Professor Renfrew, and his 'conjugate', Professor Werfner. Vibe, and his shadow Foley. Venice and Venice im Wien . The Isola degli Specchi . The curious doubly refractive properties of Iceland spar. Do you begin to see?\" \"No,\" said Miles truthfully. \"It will become clearer,\" said the Professor with unshakable confidence. \"What we are being told to consider, we soon realize, is the essential duality of nature. Yin and yang. Waves and particles. Vectors and quaternions. Bras and--\" \"Panties?\" suggested Chick. \"I was in fact about to say kets,\" said the Professor, not in the least discomfited. \"But that too. What, after all, is sex, viewed in formal terms, but a vain attempt to find a common eigenbasis for two generally non-commutative operators?\" Chick tried, with rather limited success, to find a rejoinder to this no doubt penetrating question. But before he could stammer more than a syllable or two, the Professor was off again. \"I tried to determine what it was the author was telling me,\" he continued. \"Why all these mirrors? I thought of Alice through the Looking-Glass , since childhood one of my favorite tales. And then it hit me. Lolloping Laplacians! This was evidently not the real book at all, but merely its reflection. The first step must thus be to build a device capable of restoring the true text. Luckily, I happened to have a high-quality calcite crystal and a good understanding of quaternionic theory. The decoding instrument was easy to construct.\" He strode back to the \"microscope\", replaced the thick volume in its original position, and adjusted the focus. \"Here,\" he said. \"Look at it again!\" Randolph peered through the eyepiece and whistled. \"I thought it was bad before,\" he said. \"But now! Mathematical symbols on each page, every third sentence in some outlandish language or other...\" \"One cannot deny it!\" said the Professor cheerfully. \"But having proceeded so far, we must not let ourselves be deterred. This, we have determined, is the true book. But what is it saying?\" He paused, pretending to wait for an answer to his transparently rhetorical question, but received none. \"I realized,\" he said, his voice now almost a whisper, \"that it was telling us how to understand the other world... the world on the other side of the Mirror.\" \"You mean the Looking-Glass World?\" asked Randolph. But the Professor shook his head. \"No,\" he breathed. \" not the Looking-Glass World... for, I have now come to understand, we are the Looking-Glass World, the imaginary, quaternionic world. What this book is telling us is how to reach the real world.\" The Chums gaped open-mouthed, stunned by the enormity of the revelation they had just received. \"But...\" said Lindsay in the end, \"if the book is incomprehensible...\" \" No book is incomprehensible,\" replied the Professor briskly. \"My work with Joyce convinced me of that. I now have in place a rigorous study program. Intensive courses in the development of the labor movement, the histories of Mexico and the Balkans, techniques of silver mining, the dynamics of \u00c6ther vortices, special and general relativity, vector calculus, Riemann's \u03b6-function, cricket, the exploits of the duc de Richelieu--\" \"Is that the third duc de Richelieu,\" asked Linday, who was taking notes, \"the one who was involved with \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet?\" \"The very same,\" said the Professor, without pausing for breath. \"As for languages, obviously French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. Latin and Greek go without saying. Then it is undoubtedly useful to possess at least a smattering of Dutch, Croatian, Albanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Turkish, Japanese, Swedish, Finnish--\" \"But...\" expostulated Miles, \"even if one had a century of study time...\" \"You underestimate recent advances in educational theory,\" retorted the Professor with a mischievous look. \"Choose a language, any language!\" \"You said Finnish?\" suggested Darby. \"We were there once (see The Chums of Chance and the Curse of Karelia ) and I picked up a few words of the lingo. Here, yksi , kaksi --\" \"An excellent start!\" said the Professor. \"Follow me!\" Snatching up the book again, he opened a door and led the Chums down a long corridor. After passing a dozen oak-paneled doors, they paused before one marked DEPARTMENT OF SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGES. The Professor knocked; a moment later, an arctically blonde young woman emerged, dressed in an alluringly brief ensemble consisting of a few scraps of reindeer leather. \"Excuse us for troubling you, Liisa,\" the Professor said, giving her a courtly bow. \"My young friend wishes to improve his grasp of Finnish.\" He turned to Darby. \"Unless you have got 'cold feet'?\" \"No siree,\" said Darby with undisguised enthusiasm. \"Boy-oh-boy!\" \"Excuse me,\" interrupted Lindsay in a prudishly horrified tone, \"I would just like to assure myself that this is entirely 'legit'--\" His protestations came too late; Liisa pulled Darby into the room, which appeared to contain little except a blackboard and a large bed, and closed the door, after which there came the unmistakable sound of a key being turned in a 'Yale' lock. \"You need have no fear,\" said the Professor reassuringly to Lindsay. \"We use the most modern techniques, intensive one-on-one tuition based on a version of the sexualpedagogiska metoden which Fr\u00f6ken Suomalainen has in fact been instrumental in developing...\" He continued in similar vein for a few minutes, without notably increasing Lindsay's confidence, until the door opened again and Darby stumbled out, tie orthogonally askew and almost implausibly well-informed about the inessive case. \"Was the experiment a success?\" asked the Professor. \"Who-whee!\" said the young student by way of answer. \"What's next?\" \"I think perhaps some higher mathematics,\" mused the Professor, opening another door marked ADVANCED RIEMANNIAN STUDIES. A brunette with an Italian accent was explaining the concept of hyperbolic geometry, with frequent references to her dramatic d\u00e9colletage ; but before Darby could sit down, Lindsay, wise from his earlier mistake, marched him out into the corridor again. \"Now,\" he said firmly. \"What I want to know is, do we really need all this?\" \"It is barely enough to keep up,\" said Professor Vanderjuice in a wounded tone. Randolph and Miles, familiar with this concept from an earlier adventure (see The Chums of Chance and the Red Queen's Race ), nodded, but Lindsay set his jaw defiantly. \"Let's see what Pugnax thinks,\" he muttered. \" If I may?\" He relieved the Professor of the book, which he was still holding, and bent down to show it to the hyperintelligent canine. \"Rrrf!\" exclaimed Pugnax after a few moments of perusal. \"Rrrff-rrf-RRF! Rrrf!\" The Professor suddenly looked shamefaced. \"To be completely honest,\" he sighed, \"your dog has a point. I have perhaps been a little too enthusiastic in promoting my new invention. In fact, it is sufficient to have a robust sense of humor.\" \"Rrrf, rrf-rrf!\" added Pugnax. \"Rrf!\" Vanderjuice sighed again. \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he said with just a hint of asperity. \"And a dirty mind.\" ...more I loved traveling along the four parallel storylines of this, the longest of Pynchon's books.

In retrospect, I find myself dreaming and pondering AtD more than GR or M&D. I have even developed a slight obsession with Dahlia Rideout as my favorite heroine of all time (am I alone of this particular fetish or have her beautiful eyes and sassy talk seduced other readers as well?) i wish that Brian Vaughn would do a comic of the adventures of The Chums of Chance (rather than The Escapist) as that was also an awesome and beautiful part of the plot. AtD makes me wish in vain that there was more Pynchon out there to read, but, alas, there is not. ...more Like all great things, Against The Day refuses summary. By its length and complexity, the sheer amount of Time it takes to get through, the concentration it requires to keep track of its multitude of characters, its encyclopedia of settings and events, its fascination with emerging ideas, scientific advances, political movements, technologies, its exploration of a wide variety of metaphysics and religious ideas, its globe-spanning survey of world events at the turn of the last century, by its ve Like all great things, Against The Day refuses summary. By its length and complexity, the sheer amount of Time it takes to get through, the concentration it requires to keep track of its multitude of characters, its encyclopedia of settings and events, its fascination with emerging ideas, scientific advances, political movements, technologies, its exploration of a wide variety of metaphysics and religious ideas, its globe-spanning survey of world events at the turn of the last century, by its very form and nature and what it demands of its serious readers it consumes one as one consumes it- a dedicated reader must live with it and make it live with them. I found myself unable to read anything else while reading it. It tendrils itself into one\u2019s being, and at multiple levels, for its vast intellectual wells, its deep humanity, its overt tenderness, its tendency to search out the ineffable anima of its characters, to locate the emotional node in a natural setting, often only by a fleeting observational note, how it errs on the side of the complex and the mind-bending and often absurd, how it is dedicated to not explaining its mysteries, while at the same time not shying away from lengthy digressions on mathematical abstractions and physical properties of minerals and light and space, might seem in contrast to the fanciful \u201cboy\u2019s adventure comic\u201d framing device of the novel, its frequent low-brow wordplay and ridiculous jokes, and the many turn-of-the-century story cliches it employs, expands upon, subsumes into its cosmos- pistol-packin\u2019 Westerns, hard-boiled detective novels, science fiction, prairie family dramas, etc.- but this is far from the case. The \u201ctypes\u201d employed that fill out this huge cast of characters and events are only more framing devices, tropes, daubs on the palette of a set of collective narrative tactics, a kind of collection of familiar apparitions used to set in motion Pynchon\u2019s universe-sized epic. This is one of those Big Books where it is arguable that the true \u201ccharacters\u201d of the novel are the mechanics of the universe . Light and Darkness, Time, the Stars, Gravity, Earth, Mathematics, Death, Rebirth, New Life. But this would be disregarding that the novel is really, simply, a drama of two families at the end of the 19th and early decades of the 20th century, living through its changes and disasters, its sociopolitical upheavals. And how perfect their names- Traverse and Rideout. Rideout and Traverse. One might also easily be persuaded that this is a pure fantasy novel, for it cares not for adhering to the rules of this universe, and the Chums of Chance, the aeronautic motivus of action in the book, transcend all rules of space, time, and physics. Ghosts and wanderers from the future dwell in its pages- psychics, seances, the Tarot, other-dimensional interventions are ubiquitous, impossible objects and geometry-defying buildings and landscapes abound. Within the world of ATD the fantastic lives directly astride the Real, parted only by a thin veil that is constantly leapt across. As well, one could be tempted to call ATD an historical novel (because it is pure historical fictioneering) for one of Pynchon\u2019s great preoccupations here is the \u201csingling up of all lines\u201d of history into its inevitability- how the past, when it was present tense, shed all other possibilities to become the future it became. But he extends this and asks: What of the infinite possible pasts, and if their infinite futures were realized ? What have become of and where are located the possible futures we have shed by narrowing down potentiality through choice and chance?- These other worlds, dimensions, or speculative universes are the true setting of Against The Day , and all the talk of Vectorists, Quaternions, Riemann surfaces, tesseracts, properties of the Aether, of Light, of Iceland spar and its double-refractive properties, are ways of asking a huge question, one we are caught in the very middle of in this experiment of becoming ever more conscious beings: Once, men sat and looked out on a flat plain and called that plain the world, and the world was thought flat and the center of the universe- then we built ships and set out, and found the world was round, and then we went further and found that the earth was not the center of the universe at all, but a speck in a cosmos unimaginably huge and complex- and so we built ships to attempt a crossing of that other ocean, the one not of water but of Space, and as we progress onward making discoveries and refining mathematics, it might follow that that first uncentering of the earth, the first rounding of the earth, might be the first of a long process of uncentering, of \u201crounding\u201d the universe into its proper form and setting- maybe a thread, a membrane, or a spheroid amongst countless, uncountable other universes, maybe expanding forever into what we can\u2019t conceive, and what might this mean, and who is out there living beside us, invisibly, each and every fractured moment of our lives? And are there other Selves out there, doubled, trebled, even uncountable versions of us living out lives across this multi-dimensional sprawl? What are their destinies? And, considering the unbearable tragedies of History personal and universal, what might have been ? Light and darkness, their ambiguities, how their antagonism creates our reality. Life and death, and the borderlands between, thin as a tissue, wavering in a gust of wind. Dreams and waking life, and what\u2019s the difference and how would we know when we are within one and within the other? Identity, what we are at any given moment, the way we know ourselves to be ourselves. Mathematics, science, and religion, the development of how humans attempt to explain their strange presence here in this baffling realm, which seems made not to be bound in words and symbols, but always becomes so, more and more, each day, with each new sunrise, both more understandable and simultaneously more mysterious, unexplainable. The heart and the head. All lines of history, specifically at the turn of the last century, singling up into the slaughterhouse of WWI and its death-twin two decades later, hand in hand, devouring generations and echoing like the tolls of dead bells even now, remaining in toxic presences flitting in and out of our collective consciousness, what those events tell about our nature. The horror behind us, and what\u2019s ahead? What might we make of the Time remaining? Love and absence. Family. Madness and revenge. Chance and determination. Free will or despotism. Anarchy and capitalism. These ideas, questions, problems, swirling around us in the aether, facets of mind and world- our Being is composed of how we confront these. Against The Day has somehow managed to map and tell a comedic epic of Being underneath these storm-skies, these cloud-form-phenomena that hang above us all, ready to let light in or rain down lightning and thunderous darkness. How does one possibly novelize questions like these, bring them into our terms and under the control of our language? However it is done, Pynchon has achieved that here. And it builds and builds throughout its 1100 pages to the finale, and it is fun and funny the entire time, and it is packed full of adventure and danger and heros and villains, narrow escapes and love affairs, and it is deep and wide and tender and sad and strange and struck through with longing and loss and incomprehensibility, like existence. And like us it anticipates something parting the darkened sky, a vehicle of magic bearing \u201cgood unsought and uncompensated\u201d, from some dimension better than ours, to deliver us, to carry us away in light- We of the Futurity of Narrowing Possibilities, we await our Chums of Chance. They fly toward grace. ...more Update the second, March 08 Well, well, well [she says, much subdued, pensive; not at all her normal, boistrous, effusive self]. Here we are, March 1, 2008, and I have just closed the cover of <+++>Against the Day</+++> . I suppose it's hard to even talk about a tome like this, a thing of this range and scope and breadth. I'd really like to use all the superlatives I can, and then invent new words to describe Pynchon and what he does, because he really is like nothing else ever. In fact, I've been saying that Update the second, March 08 Well, well, well [she says, much subdued, pensive; not at all her normal, boistrous, effusive self]. Here we are, March 1, 2008, and I have just closed the cover of Against the Day . I suppose it's hard to even talk about a tome like this, a thing of this range and scope and breadth. I'd really like to use all the superlatives I can, and then invent new words to describe Pynchon and what he does, because he really is like nothing else ever. In fact, I've been saying that to all my friends over the months I've been ensconsed in this book, that what Pynchon writes are not novels, in any traditional sense, I think. They just flagrantly ignore the rules of structure, and sense, and momentum. If you'll indulge me, I've come up with a sort-of analogy for this. It's like, instead of reading a book, you're like reading a chunk of a river. (Bear with me here.) Whereas normally a book will progress, go beginning-middle-end, this one is like a million rivulets, each slipping overunderthrough one another, that you follow for a second, or a couple pages, until they go back under and get lost in the general cacophony. Lots of the characters even have names like that -- Stray, Reef, Lake, Heartsease, Ljubica (which means 'love'), Ryder -- that just slip through your fingers as you say them, as the characters go somewhere else and you lose track. There are no beginnings or ends to a river (see? I'm bringing it back), you just watch as different bits of it flit by. I mean, how can I read something else now? This book kind of disassembles your concept of reading, of how to read, of how to go through a book. In a way I feel like I should just keep reading this, over and over, for the rest of my reading life. Also, because of all this, 1,085 pages is really nowhere near enough. There is so much more to the lives of these characters! I mean because the book really encompases the whole world, right? So everyone is still living somewhere, in the world between the pages (because, oddly, I don't know that anyone of note actually dies in this book), and I want to know what they do with the rest of their lives, who they go on to love, how they fight, what cities they stumble through, how they find their circuitous destinies. (This is insanely presumptuous, but I think Pynchon might be fond of that thought, since so much is made in this book of people doubling, and living many lives, in and out of the world, or the 'Counter-Earth', or within photographs, or after having Zombini do some kind of spell, or that thing with the Iceland spar, which I don't know if I really get.) I guess I'm babbling. But I think that's fitting too, for this book. I've gotten a lot of different kinds of shit from different friends for my rapturous devotion to Mr. Pynchon. I don't care. I also don't care that this is probably a sort of frustrating review, which doesn't say much at all about the book. I also don't care that there is obvs so much in this book that I didn't get, and would never get, even if I did spend the rest of my reading life on it. I don't care. I am fiercely in love with Against the Day . I am fanatically devoted to Thomas Pynchon. I am so, so thrilled that I read this book. Update, Jan 08 In case anyone's keeping track, I am just a smidge over halfway through this fucker. And as a diversion, I present you with a few random samples of Pynchonery: \"Abruptly, sweeping into the scene like an opera singer with an aria to unload, here came 'Mr. Ace,' as he called himself. Glossy black eyes, presented like weapons in a duel. When he smiled, or attempted to, it was not reassuring.\" \"It was all he could do not to reach for her, gather her into some kind of perimiter. But the moisture in her eyes was shining like steel, not dew, and nothing about her trembled.\" \"You could hear faint strands of music, crazy stuff, banjos and bugling, trombone glissandi, pianos under the hands of whorehouse professors sounding like they came with keys between the keys.\" \"Dally's voice was hard to pin down to any one American place, more of a trail voice with turns and drops to it, reminders of towns you thought you'd forgotten or should never've rode into, or even promises of ones you might've heard about and were fixing to get to someday.\" See? See?? First entry, Nov 07 wooooo hoooooooooo!!!!! (that's me going down the rabbit hole, as it were, into the depths of Pynchonalia) Also, it's so convenient that the folios of this book are such that there are five blank pages at the back. Now I can (with no shame whatsoever) keep a list of all the characters! How the hell else am I going to make it through a 1,085-page monstrosity? ...more [written 2008] The early reviews I read of Against the Day were all a little bewildered, and gave me the distinct impression that a lot of reviewers had tried to skim-read this huge novel so they could get their articles written in time. It's not an easy one to write up at all. It's very long, very busy, and you come to it with all kinds of preconceptions, just because it's Pynchon and although he's only written a few novels they all seem to be masterpieces. For people who have been following him [written 2008] The early reviews I read of Against the Day were all a little bewildered, and gave me the distinct impression that a lot of reviewers had tried to skim-read this huge novel so they could get their articles written in time. It's not an easy one to write up at all. It's very long, very busy, and you come to it with all kinds of preconceptions, just because it's Pynchon and although he's only written a few novels they all seem to be masterpieces. For people who have been following him over the years, it's something of a change of direction. His last two books, Vineland and Mason & Dixon , seemed to show a new concern with characters, personalities and intimacy compared to the unreconstructed craziness of his earlier work. But Against the Day has much more in common with his earlier books \u2013 it most closely resembles Gravity's Rainbow (the hipster's long novel of choice), although there is a weariness, a kind of ironic distance at work here which points to an older author. If it seems like I'm putting off the business of actually trying to explain what this novel's about, it's because I am. Ostensibly we are looking at a timeframe moving from the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 to the years immediately after the First World War. Pynchon has always been much more interested than his compatriot writers in the world outside America, and here we get wonderful sketches of everywhere from Colorado, New York and Chicago to Siberia, London, Yugoslavia, Morocco, revolutionary Mexico, Constantinople, Venice and plenty more besides. The cast of characters is huge, though not as disorienting as some reviewers have made out. The main plot strand concerns three brothers from Colorado trying to avenge their father's murder, though there is also a boy's-own spy story involving British agents and unrest in the Balkans, not to mention a whole subplot about characters who are at least partly fictional even within the world of the novel. It's not even entirely certain whether or not these events are taking place precisely in our world. In the novel, not only do we have the new force of electricity changing the face of society, but we also have mathematicians and scientists devising machines which can make photographs move or allow for the possibility of time-travel. In many ways it's written not as a historical novel but as a sci-fi novel might have looked written by someone in the 1880s. \u2018By now,\u2019 someone remarks at one point, \u2018I know that your most deranged utterances are only conventional history prematurely blurted.\u2019 At first that just seems like a cute conceit, but as the novel goes on it assumes a greater importance. There is always a suggestion that the world of possibilities shown in here somehow became our own world after some cataclysmic event, which is especially associated with the War. \u2018This world you take to be \u201cthe\u201d world will die,\u2019 says one character, \u2018and descend into Hell, and all history after that will belong properly to the history of Hell.\u2019 The upcoming war looms over everything, just as the Second World War did over Gravity's Rainbow . It is conceived as being so awful that it has stained time itself, affecting events long before it happened with an air of sinister disaster. It is the darkness behind everyday events, which is sensed preternaturally by almost every character in the book, and which allows Pynchon to give free rein to his delight in finding mystery and paranoia in otherwise normal events. Who else would, or could, describe a sunrise like this: The sun came up a baleful smear in the sky, not quite shapeless, in fact able to assume the appearance of a device immediately recognizable yet unnameable, so widely familiar that the inability to name it passed from simple frustration to a felt dread, whose intricacy deepened almost moment to moment \u2013 its name a word of power, not to be spoken aloud, not even to be remembered in silence. Here you can see all Pynchon's trademarks \u2013 the long sentences, stacks of clauses skirting round some inexplicable sensation of mystery, a general feeling that you're never totally sure what he's going on about. It is this mood, rather than any event-based plot, which Pynchon is concerned with describing. And the writing is everything you'd hope for \u2013 I think he's the best writer of sentences since Nabokov. Some of the turns of phrase stop you dead: a view from a hotel window of \u2018long, moon-stung waves\u2019; a rough night for someone who \u2018didn't so much sleep as become intermittently conscious of time\u2019; or an emotional parting at a railway station, of which we are told: \u2018though their kiss went on for what could have been hours, so little did it have to do with clock time, she was already miles away down those rails before their lips even touched.\u2019 Looking back through my copy to pick out these passages, it's telling that I can hardly remember now which characters are even being written about here. They seem less important than what he uses them to say. Some people might even call them types; you could certainly be forgiven for getting a bit suspicious about the way every single female character is a submissive nymphomaniac \u2013 though that certainly allows for a lot of fun along the way. (OK, there's one major exception, but she's a dominant nymphomaniac.) The verisimilitude is also not helped much by the outrageous names everyone seems to have, like Professor Heino Vanderjuice or a musician called Chester LeStreet (hee-hee). It's definitely a little disappointing after where he seemed to be going with the last couple of books, but still, there's no doubt that by the end there are a core group of people who you really do care about. And they can be fun too. One of the many pleasures of the book comes from the incongruence of people and places, like the grizzled American detective who finds himself working for a tarot cult among the upper classes in London. The Colorado boys in particular generate some fantastically gruff dialogue, including one of my favourite remarks: \u2018 Tengo que get el fuck out of aqu\u00ed .\u2019 The women are intelligent and funny and, as I mentioned, permanently horny. He does sexy rather well. \u2018Just can't stay away,\u2019 whispers one respectable girl who has ended up all corrupted in a brothel out west, \u2018\u2026you've simply ruined me for everyday bourgeois sexuality. Whatever am I to do?\u2019 The proliferation of characters is partly down to one of the book's most important themes, that of doubling. Two of the cast, Renfrew and Werfner, are mirror-images of each other in more than just name; someone else finds himself wondering if he could be his own ghost. We hear much of the shamanic practice of bilocation, by which someone can be literally in two places at once, and there is also a preoccupation with Iceland spar, a kind of crystal which creates a doubling of light \u2013 and, by implication, of the world itself. Pynchon seems to have taken the advice of one of his characters: \u2018When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\u2019 Like a lot of Pynchon's books, it starts off being a whole lot of fun with crazy jokes and weird sex and unnecessary songs, and yet again by the time you're sucked in you can't help feeling that something very important is going on. It seems to have to do with understanding what kind of person you might have been if some choices had been made differently, and what kind of world there could have been if some choices had been made differently. With some aliens, threesomes, tommyknockers, cowboys and meteorites thrown in.Have we been here before? Oh\u2026maybe. Still, it seems a bit harsh to criticise him for producing more of the same when the same is so brilliant, so rich, and so full of complex and fascinating pleasures. Above all I was left feeling the sadness and the wonder of all the potential worlds I and everyone else could be creating, if we only had more time to stop and work out how.

They make it too easy to read their fiction. We expect authors to comply with conventions of story-telling, a manageable number of characters, a narrative arc, a sense of relevance and progress towards a conclusion, a climax, a goal, a realisation and/or an understanding. Pynchon doesn't necessarily write this way. He takes us to a world that might look like ours, but it is potentially alien (or at least foreign), in that there are some things or a lot of things that we do not know or understand about it. \"I'll tell you a story someday. Maybe.\" [Thomas Pynchon, \"Against the Day\"] What we see and experience at first might look familiar, superficially, but ours is the experience of a tourist, a stranger in a strange land or a space traveler landing on a distant moon or planet. We have to construct knowledge, meaning and understanding, bit by bit, like a spy, a sleuth or a detective. \"...a crime, often of the gravest sort, committed in a detective story, may often be only a pretext for the posing and solution of some narrative puzzle...\" [Thomas Pynchon, \"Against the Day\"] Pynchon doesn't just present his fictional world to us in easily digested mouthfuls. Whether or not his novels are difficult, they require mastication, exertion. We have to work on them. We have to do our bit. Having bitten off, we must chew. This is their challenge, but even more importantly this is our reward. Pynchon offers us not mindless pleasures (an early working title for \"Gravity's Rainbow\"), but exquisitely mindful pleasures. \"'Oh, you're overthinking it all,' Yashmeen said, 'as usual.'\" [Thomas Pynchon, \"Against the Day\"] That said, what would a Pynchon novel be if you didn't endeavour to think (or overthink) it through? Are we meant to settle for studied incomprehension? \"NOW SINGLE UP ALL LINES!\" The first line of the novel is a nautical term that relates to the preparation of a ship (or in this case, an airship) to leave its mooring and depart (or take off). Several sets of double ropes would normally secure the ship in its place. This command reduces the mooring to one rope in each position. It\u2019s a halfway step. Just as it releases the ship, it releases the lines themselves: once freed of their burden, the lines can now float free. They might also represent the verbal lines of the book, which are then commanded to cast off \u201ccheerly now... handsomely... very well,\u201d a perfect description of what Pynchon proceeds to do throughout the novel. He writes comically, eloquently and effectively. \"It's Always Night, or We Wouldn't Need Light\" The epigraph is attributed to Thelonious Monk in a Time Magazine profile published in 1964. While it might have been an expression that Monk used frequently, it could be a misquotation of another expression attributed to Monk by the saxophonist Steve Lacy in 1960: \"It must be always night, otherwise they wouldn't need the lights.\" The two expressions have slightly different connotations. The first implies that the darkness of the night requires the enlightenment of the day or lighting. However, the second, in the context of jazz musicians playing at night in clubs, implies that the dimly lit darkness is a precondition for their music, their creativity, spontaneity and improvisation. The darkness is not a negative quality that needs to be alleviated by the light. It\u2019s a positive that allows individuals to perform at their best. \"Against the Day\" This construction, if it\u2019s credible, hints at the meaning of the title \"against the day\". In the novel, which is set between the 1890\u2019s and the early 1920\u2019s (the era in which Modernism began), it\u2019s the light of day that is the negative. It symbolises the work of the Devil, the obviousness and conformity of the crowd, and its scrutiny by the powers that be (whether governments or employers). Pynchon\u2019s sympathy is very much with non-conformists, anarchists and socialists who are battling against capitalism and imperialism (or different manifestations of civilisation promoted by Great Britain, Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Tsarist Russia and Turkey), often with the only tools available to them: strikes, protests, assassinations, bombings and terrorism. The latter are the underground (the counterculture), the former the overground (the over the counter culture). Above them all are the Chums of Chance, \"a five-lad crew\" (plus their dog, Pugnax, who enjoys reading Henry James\u2019 \u201cThe Princess Casamassima\u201d, also a novel about radical politics featuring a terrorist assassination plot) who float above the world in their airship (\u201cthe Inconvenience\u201d), privileged to have a map-like perspective or birdseye view of the clashes of civilisations occurring on the surface. By befriending chance, they too oppose (law and) order, and embrace the chaos of unrestrained freedom, free as birds (although as Bob Dylan would later ask in \"Ballad In Plain D\" , \"are birds free from the chains of the skyway?\") Servants of Greed and Force Underlying the clash of civilisations is a (daylit) certainty that I (the sovereign Subject) am right and you (the Other object which is the subject of sovereignty) are wrong. Pynchon questions certitude and power from both mathematical and metaphysical perspectives. The maths might deter some readers who would otherwise thoroughly enjoy the novel. However, in truth, it's not necessary to study up on it, unless you're particularly inclined to do so. It's primarily contextual, and there is enough explanation in the novel itself to get Pynchon's drift. The maths is largely dispensed with in the first third to half of the novel. I tried to keep up, but still found myself doing some online research to determine how much I was missing out on. However, once I felt that I had some basic layman's understanding of the issues, I was content to focus on the pleasures of the text. This mightn't be much comfort to a sceptical or impatient reader, but I found that it was a lot easier to read, comprehend and enjoy the novel after the first 490 pages or so! The Fork in the Silk Road The maths helps to understand the concept of doubling or coupling that is fundamental to the book. Neither concept is far removed from Nabokov's employment of doubles in \"Lolita\". It's a literary or cultural device, in this case, one built on a mathematical or scientific foundation. If we start with a ray of light passing through a prism (such as Iceland spar), it's possible that the ray might be refracted into two sets of waves or particles. Thus, the thing that was once singular might now be separate or double. If there is a symmetry between the refracted light, one wave might be the opposite or inverse of the other. Thus, we have the potential for both \"bi-location\" and \"algebraic coupling\". However, what is separate or inverted can potentially be joined or reverted. Pynchon jokes that the German word \"und\" when refracted and inverted might become the English word \"pun\". Thus, yet again (after \"Mason & Dixon\"), a conjunction is both significant and comical. Metaphysically, what was once one, but is now two, might either engage in a life and death struggle, or seek to be re-united. Thus, the double can either encounter itself in duplicity or oneness. This is equally applicable to nations and people. Dive-Bombing into the Day From a national perspective, duplicity can result in war, unless resolved by treaty or entente. There's much conflict between civilisations and nations in the novel. This aspect reminded me of Lawrence Durrell's works \"White Eagles Over Serbia\" and \"The Alexandria Quartet\", just as much as boys' own adventure stories from the days of the British Empire (subsequently reprised in the likes of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and steam-punk). Pynchon captures how conflict followed from Imperialism, which followed from Capitalism, which was founded on the separation of labor and capital, as well as male and female. The Interwovenness of Desires From an individual perspective, opposites often attract, if only motivated by the desire to reunite what was once one (\"the secular expressions of a rupture within a single damaged soul\"). This is often the most fascinating aspect of Pynchon novels. His early works were ineffably romantic, \"Against the Day\", even more so (fewer characters being truly uneffable). This novel is what I'd call \"anarcho-romantic\", opposing power and master/slave relationships with freedom and equality, both socially and sexually. We shouldn't be wasting our time building wealth for capitalists and imperialists, but punning, playing games and having sex in some new Utopian commonwealth of nations and genders. (I'll give it a go...again!) I Heart Yashmeen Halfcourt The Triumph of the Night Sex is a major part of \"Against the Day\", as if it's the most obvious activity to engage in at night (when pitted against the day). Pynchon's representation of sex is a product of liberation. It doesn't come attached to any particular configuration of genders, body parts or numerical permutations and combinations, as long as you're having at least one orgasm (each), some fun, a giggle or a look. She is the World For all the sex, this fictional world is just as much a woman's, as a man's, world. Its 70 chapters are a quasi-biblical septuagint. Towards the end, it segued into a nativity story of Yashmeen's Christ-like daughter, Ljubica (literal meaning: love or kiss; violet [see also chaya or etheric double]). However, this is just one of many tales of family, love, romance, passion, flirtation and kissing in the novel. Whereas the focus of \"V.\" was the feminine and \"Gravity's Rainbow\" the masculine, \"Against the Day\" suggests that what is paramount, in the night of the liberated imagination and against the rationalism of the pseudo-illuminated day, is our relationships with each other, including and especially family. Perhaps, at the end of the day, family is even more important than mathematics and science. All we need is love. The Green Hour Did I mention food, alcohol and drugs? Meals are intimately described, as if on a menu. The alcohol is as bar-hoppingly diverse as the geographical canvas of the narrative. The drugs reflect the taste of an author born in the 30's writing about the time before his birth. The alcohol and drugs, in particular, enable us to see what is not there, sometimes even what is there but invisible. \"Or, as we like to say, l\u2019heure vertigineuse.\" \"The Absinthe Drinker\" by Viktor Oliva Oops, I just realised I hadn't mentioned philately or cricket, the latter of which is the greatest game, the game that witnessed an empire become a commonwealth of sorts.

I don't know whether he really said that or not, but the point I want to make is that no one in Pynchon's generation can make that statement. If we're not as good as we should be, it's not because there isn't a standard. And I think Pynchon, more than any other writer, has set the standard.

This book is an example of historiographic metafiction or those postmodernist works that are intensely self-reflective and yet paradoxically also claim to historical events and parsonages. (Source: Wiki). Of course, I must admit that I did not understand half of what this book was saying. Yet it is enjoyable because it is different. Pynchon is a bully. He wrote this book to show his talent as a writer. He appeared to me as a boastful (yet he has the right to be) novelist who enjoys writing long novels to prove that he is a cut above the rest. I am different! I am better than you! He, for me, is a modern-day James Joyce; who wrote another book that I did not fully understand and yet I found beautiful: Ulysses. Although this book is more ambitious than that: it's scope is wider (for 1893 to the early 1920's) compared to just a day on Dublin streets. Against the Day also uses contemporary English and yet Pynchon, like Joyce, uses textual play, parody and historical re-conceptualization that are shapeless and almost bereft of emotional impact. Like I said, reading this book is like standing on a side street watching the parade of images passing you by. The images can be blurry (because I am not familiar with those that Pynchon was trying to make fun about) or as sharp as a megapixel photo (because of the way he described them). However, at the end of my reading, they all seem to mix with one another and if I think through the possible theme - that main thin thread that passes through or binds the 1,220 pages - it is nothing but a show. There are many characters with names easy to remember: Sloat (my favorite), Deuce, Yasmeen, Miles, Chick, Lindsay, Randolf, Pugnax, Luca, etc. and yet I know that not one of these will linger in my mind like how Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus made an erasable imprint in my brain as fictional characters. However, what made this unforgettable is the mere fact of reading it. It gave me headache and backache (no book has made my mind swirled as crazy as this) and yet you know that this is brilliancy at its finest. Mediocre novelists definitely don't compare. I mean who among the living writers can compose a beautiful novel with 1,220 pages and small dense prints? Publishers will be wary about the cost of publishing it if there is no guarantee that the book has captured readers. Pynchon has them. This being my 2nd book by him (my first was his thinner book, The Crying of Lot 49 ) I am happy to say that I will not think twice to someday read his other works like Gravity's Rainbow , V , Vineland and Mason and Dixon. All of them are door-stoppers but sure to be beautiful, well-crafted, first-class door-stoppers. ...more Against the Day , for me, is pure reading bliss.

Of the thousand-and-one topics within this book, my favorite themes dwell on light, time, parallel universes, and dimensional transcendence. Anarchy may be the most prevalent thread found throughout, but an equally prominent theme, if only slightly less obvious, is the search for Shambhala\u2014both the mythological kingdom said to be hidden somewhere in Inner Asia, as well as the invisible spiritual equivalent located within the Self. There are stories, like maps that agree...too consistent among too many languages and histories to be only wishful thinking\u2026. It is always a hidden place, the way into it is not obvious, the geography is as much spiritual as physical. If you should happen upon it, your strongest certainty is not that you have discovered it but returned to it. In a single great episode of light, you remember everything. Regarding light, one character sums up Pynchon\u2019s curiosity with it when he says: I want to reach inside light and find its heart, touch its soul, take some in my hands whatever it turns out to be, and bring it back. One distinctly memorable scene involves an encounter with a tree in Mexico full of giant luminous beetles all flashing on and off together in unison. While watching these magnificent creatures, the observer somehow realizes (I won\u2019t pretend I can convey the same magic Pynchon does, so you will just have to take this at face value) one of the illuminated beetles is his soul, and that the other beetles of light on the tree are the souls of everyone he has ever known. All together these synchronized strobing souls make up one complete radiant soul in the same way that light is indivisible. Light is living tissue. As the brain is the outward and visible expression of the Mind. Pynchon has even more fun exploring the nature of time. For what mission have I here, in this perilous segment of space-time, if not somehow to transcend it? Most of the book takes place in the years leading up to WWI. Using the knowledge of the day, Pynchon bombards the reader in mathematical theories on vectors and quaternions in an attempt to push the boundaries of three-dimensional space. All this leads up to his attacks on the so-called \u2018forth dimension.\u2019 Even wondering if we can look at the \u2018forth dimension\u2019 as if it were time, when it is really something of its own, and \u2018Time\u2019 is only our best imperfect approximation. When dissecting and reassembling time, Pynchon seems to place a keen interest in manipulating it for the reader\u2019s benefit and joy. Pynchon is something of a mystic and trickster. Whatever the number of n dimensions it inhabited, an observer would need one extra, n + 1, to see and connect the end points to make a single resultant. Pynchon must somehow reside in, or frequently visit an extra dimension from the norm. How else is he able to bring back to consensus reality seemingly endless accounts from other realms, parallel universes, and multiple dimensions, all while transporting the reader along with him into those very same worlds? ...more Video-review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APsR1...

It's possible that the ending will cause me to reconsider some of what I'm about to say, but given what I've seen so far, I doubt it. I want to like Pynchon. Lots of people I respect are very fond of him (see e.g. this glowing review by Adam Roberts ), and he's often mentioned in connection with writers I like (Wallace, Barth, Nabokov, postmodern fiction in general). He certainly seems lovable. His books are bursting with cool esoteric facts and wacky character names. He exudes a boisterous love for material existence in all its particularity. He's obsessed with ukuleles. What a character, right? I dunno. Somehow he's never worked for me. I read The Crying of Lot 49 and, while it didn't strike me as actively bad, it failed to excite any visible activity on my E-Meter. Totally neutral. If there was a point, I missed it. Then I tried Gravity's Rainbow, had a negative visceral response and put it down (with some force) on page 120. But I was determined to finish one of these big Pynchon books in my lifetime, and I had heard that ATD was gentler and more fun than GR, so I said what the hell. 200 pages in, I was hopeful. The book seemed just plain good, charming, lyrical, plotty. I thought I was finally on Pynchon's wavelength. 752 pages in, I can report that I was wrong: I'm still as mystified as ever. A saner review would end there. I just don't get Pynchon, and if I try to explain what's \"wrong\" with him I'll simply annoy people and/or make a fool of myself. Well, here goes. It's the End of the World As We Know It The word \"day\" in ATD's title has at least two meanings: it refers to the time when the sun is up and everything's illuminated, and also to the day in the sense of \"the present day.\" As early as that title and the epigraph -- \"it's always night, or we wouldn't need light\" -- ATD sets up the core of its thematic edifice. That core is an opposition between \"the day\" and \"the night.\" \"The day\" is daytime clarity, logic, consolidation, lack of ambiguity, \"official\" versions of history, electricity, modernity. It is aligned with the version of America that is quickly being established at the time at which the novel is set -- the turn of the twentieth century -- an America with a relatively homogeneous culture, relatively powerful institutions (private and public), an America that communicates at the speed of electric current and can form nationwide consensuses with relatively little latency. \"The night\" is nighttime haziness, pre-modernity, subjectivity, secret histories, esoteric knowledge, fiction, mad hopes, counterfactuals of all sorts, the subjunctive. The central conceit of ATD is that the day's victory -- the victory of modernity and its official, real-world history -- was not inevitable, and that at the turn of the 20th century the day contended with a vast range of competing possible worlds. On the most mundane level, Pynchon is suggesting that other social arrangements (anarchy rather than consolidation of power) and other scientific ideas (quaternions rather than vectors) fought for precedence with the ones we actually got. But with characteristic zeal for the blurring of the metaphoric bridge, Pynchon also explores wilder interpretations of the phrase \"possible worlds.\" At times the counterfactuals become literal alternate universes in the science fictional sense. Sometimes they are doppelgangers or alternate selves coexisting in one universe, which have some vague connection to the imaginary numbers. Sometimes the counterfactuals are not alternate histories but actual fictions , as when we see the Chums of Chance, the heroes of a 1890s-era boy's adventure serial (Pynchon's invention), acquire real existence in the same world in which the books they star in are published. How much of this is \"true\"? How much of it is insightful? Surely the modern world we actually got was not quite inevitable. But whether this has any interesting connection to the relationship between written fiction and reality, much less to the relation between imaginary and real numbers, is questionable. It probably doesn't matter -- it seems best to view ATD as an exuberant fantasy, an attempt to envision a version of the pre-WWI era in which nocturnal/counterfactual weirdos of every conceivable kind , from anarchists to time travelers, mount a motley, heroic last stand against the day. That, in the abstract, sounds promising. The problems are all in the details. We Danced Like People in the Hyper-Tight Light of Fried Chicken Commercials ATD's world is made out of the raw material of genre cliche. The characters are boy adventurers, western gunslingers, evil plutocrats, globetrotting spies, bewitching women from the Orient. Reviewers infinitely more well-read than I have charted the way that Pynchon (yet more well-read) derives almost every one of his characters and episodes from the conventions of one 1900-era popular genre or another. The book revels in its own gleeful corniness, or rather the juxtaposition of that corniness with torrents of accurate historical detail and writing that's way beyond anything in the source material. It's the kind of thing I'd want to call \"campy\" if Sontag hadn't declared that you can't be campy on purpose. Pynchon, evidently, is interested in combining artifice with realism and the serious with the silly. That's something I love too, and a lot of the appeal of this sort of book for me is in the way implausible or impossible things can be made to feel real through the magic act that is good writing. Pynchon's version of this effect, though, is quite different from (say) the version I loved in Wallace's Infinite Jest. Wallace creates a political and social situation that's absurd and cartoonish, but when he zooms in on any of the people living in that situation, they feel real. From afar, the world of Infinite Jest looks like a maniacal child's play set, but if you peer inside the minds of any of the action figures you find fully functional minds with hopes and neuroses, reflecting and deliberating in hyper-realistic detail. Pynchon, by contrast, never delves for more than a fleeting moment into any given character's mind. References to mental states crop up, but usually in the service of getting someone from one place to another, or of depicting the long-time evolution of a relationship or the like -- a textual version of the montage. Moment-to-moment consciousness, not yet edited into time-lapse summaries, is not among his subjects. His version of the artifice/realism two-step is a more third-person, solipsistic one. Put simply, he takes silly things and takes them seriously , or vice versa. This is fundamentally different from making silly characters real by depicting their consciousness. It's a gesture of the writer's own consciousness, a change in writerly stance that need not accompany any shift in the object of that stance. Pynchon's gambit is that his corny subject matter can be elevated by modulations of his own way of speaking about it, by calculated bursts of lyrical, quintessential \"good writing.\" So, for instance, when we first meet the Chums of Chance (pedant repellant: technically, the five-boy crew of the skyship Inconvenience , one unit of the larger Chums of Chance organization), the writing sounds like this: \"Oh, boy!\" cried Darby Suckling, as he leaned over the lifelines to watch the national heartland deeply swung in a whirling blur of green far below, his tow-colored locks streaming in the wind past the gondola like a banner to leeward. (Darby, as my faithful readers will remember, was the \"baby\" of the crew, and served as both factotum and mascotte, singing as well the difficult treble parts whenever these adolescent aeronauts found it impossible to contain song of some kind.) \"I can't hardly wait!\" he exclaimed. (1-2) But the pastiche of boy's adventure stories doesn't follow the Chums everywhere, and sometimes we read things like this: For somehow, the earlier, the great, light had departed, the certitude become broken as ground-dwellers' promises -- time regained its opacity, and one day the boys, translated here to Belgium, as if by evil agency, had begun to lapse earthward through a smell of coal smoke and flowers out of season, toward a beleaguered coast ambiguous as to the disposition of land and sea, down into seaside shadows stretching into the growing dark, shadows that could not always be correlated with actual standing architecture, folding and pleating ever inwardly upon themselves, an entire mapful of unlighted outer neighborhoods sprawled among the dunes and small villages. . . . (551) Neither of these passages blends with character psychology in the way good third-person prose often does. Is the quaint, awkward style of the first quote reflective of how the Chums think? Is the shadowy dread in the second quote the Chums' own, or just the narrator's? We might wonder if the changing style reflects the Chums' growing maturity. But there is no such trajectory in the Chums' own behavior, only in the writing. The tone and style of the second quote has essentially nothing to do with the human subject matter -- it is just Pynchon choosing to relate the experiences of inane characters in a high-flown style, because he can . (The Chums are an extreme case, but most of this carries over to the other major characters.) Just as Pynchon is uninterested in conventional characterization, he is also uninterested in plot. It feels odd to call ATD a plotless novel, since it is a novel in which a great deal happens. These events, however, are not connected by anything resembling cause and effect. Plot devices enter the story, stick around for a scene or two, and then disappear. Different strands of the plot do not interact with one another even when they would be expected to, as though they are taking place in different universes (in some cases, this may literally be true). In one early chapter, the Chums transport to New York City some sort of alien (?) embryo which has been retrieved from the north pole, and it proceeds to wreak havoc in a sort of a pre-image of 9/11. The whole thing is a great little episode of Lovecraftian sci-fi, quite successful on its own, and I was excited to see where Pynchon would take it. The answer, of course, is that he doesn't take it anywhere. The devastation of New York never comes up again. There is probably some multiversal explanation for this, but it is nonetheless a perfectly typical example of the book's acausality. What the book eventually begins to feel like, dispiritingly enough, is a television series. It's televisual in its abundance of period-authentic visual detail (\"eye-catching sets\") and its paucity of mental detail, its remixing of existing genres (imagine the pitch: \"it's a steampunk revenge western sci-fi period piece!\"), its seemingly endless and aimless succession of amusing episodes with no lasting consequences, its preference for characterization by means of snappy dialogue. When the plot is allowed to move, it moves in ways that feel like internal compromises on the part of a writing staff. For instance, one chapter culminates in the death of a semi-major villain, but this villain is merely the lesser member of a villainous pair, with little significance of his own, and so the \"writer\" of that \"episode\" can happily top off his story with an apparently important plot point without altering the overall situation in any way that might impair the freedom of other staff members to explore the setting in their own ways. Things change, but nothing really changes; you can tune in next week, even if you've missed an episode or two, and be confident that you'll encounter the same kind of adventure you're used to. Pynchon distorts conventional storytelling for artistic purposes, but he ends up in the same place as artistically unambitious TV shows. (What would Wallace say?) Thomas Pynchon vs. The World Where are the day and the night in all of this? Pynchon's fondness for everything he associates with the night (everything he pits against the day) often frames itself as a fondness for human freedom. Pynchon is for the right to go crazy, to disobey conventional canons of taste and decency, to refuse to do what The Man -- or the plot -- tells you to do. Over time, though, Pynchon's enforced entropy begins to feel more oppressive than any strong plot ever could. Behind the string-pulling mastermind villain Scarsdale Vibe is Pynchon himself, pulling strings to make sure nothing ever connects. True freedom, after all, depends on a reliable underlying physics, a logic of cause-and-effect. I could stop writing this review right now and walk outside my apartment -- that's a way in which I am free. I would feel much less free if I, say, did not feel (mostly) sure that in doing so I would not step into an alternate universe (something that actually happens to one ATD character). I am free to choose my actions, but implicit in the notion of \"actions\" is some sense of consequence; if I don't know how the world will respond, I have no basis on which to choose how to act, and might as well not be free at all. Pynchon's characters seem superficially free -- and utilize that freedom in all the traditional boozy, horny, countercultural ways -- but these dancers in the dark face a world which is less meaningful, less connected, than even our own vale of tears. So the night and the day are strangely mixed in Pynchon's world. Nocturnal chaos reaches, in its statistical limit, a homogeneity indistinguishable from the results of authoritarian, diurnal control. People straight from the light of a flickering television screen in the 21st century flit about among glittering reflective surfaces, outer lives without inner lives. This is freedom? This is the carnival, the night? Is Pynchon trying to tell me that in the end the day and the night are one in the same? But I can simply pick up another, better book and verify that this is not the case: it is easy to find characters both more free and more constrained. Freedom that breaks down this way is not the genuine article. What Pynchon needs sorely in this book is a foil. A staunch representative of the day, an advocate of traditional fiction and the conventional view of modern history. Someone to tell him, when he strays: dammit, Tom, you're getting into pure stoner logic here, there really isn't any connection between historical counterfactuals and imaginary numbers except as a very facile metaphor. This book is lacking in the heat and light that results from genuine conflict. It is drowning in pure gooey Pynchonianness, so suffused with Pynchon's fixation on everything alternative that the mainstream never gets to make its case. Show me the face of coherence, if only so you can reject it. If Pynchon wants to escape into the bland infinity of endless alternatives, I would at least like to see what he is running from. ...more Go read Geoff's review here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...

Then go read Theroux's great review in the WSJ - http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB1164... \" If there is an inevitability to arrival by water, he reflected, as we watch the possibilities on the shore being progressively narrowed at last to the destined quay or slip, there is no doubt a mirror-symmetry about departure, a denial of inevitability, an opening out from the point of embarkation, beginning the moment all lines are singled up, an unloosening of fate as the unknown and perhaps the uncreated begins to make its appearance, ahead and astern, port and starboard, everywhere an expanding of possibility, even for ship's company who may've made this run hundreds of times\u2026\" Paranoia is a sensation one would naturally associate with Pynchon, and one should always read his texts with almost pathologically heightened spider-sense. So when, for example, we discover that all of his novels contain a reference to \"singling up all lines\" (a nautical term indicating the moment before departure) one would be wise to note that this tells us something important about what his novels are doing (a nod here to Geoff and others who, in comments during his reading of V, made this clear). The quote above, from page 821 of AtD is a pretty obvious metaphor for his work. The use of the word \"uncreated\" is not accidental, nor is the suggestion that we as readers may have made this journey many times before. But, for Pynchon, and for those of us lucky enough to read him, possibility is always expanding, is illimitable and, as such, story and hi-story can take us anywhere it damn well chooses. And so, though this is a novel about love and about family (a journey we have traveled a hundred times before) it is also about the violent collision of both with the mechanised horrors of the 20th century. It is about the Dream of Rationalism, about illimitable hope for progress and the advancement of our species. And about dirty, puerile, disappointing Life. But most of all, and this stands out most strongly when I read criticism of the book, it is about Webb, Mayva, Reef, Lake, Kit and Frank Traverse. Their friends, enemies and lovers. It is about these parents and their children, about loyalty, failure, betrayal and memory. How anyone can possibly find these characters \"flat\" or \"flimsy constructions\" is entirely beyond me. Every event, every person, in this novel orbits around this family. They are the novel's core and its lightening rod. To see, for example, the science sections as somehow unconnected to, or not relevant to, this family is to entirely miss the point. A crystal of Iceland spar has a fascinating property. Because of its natural polarization it is birefringent, meaning light rays entering the crystal become polarized, split, and take two paths to exit the crystal - creating a double image of an object seen through the crystal. This property had a huge impact on the scientific developments of the late 19th and early 20thc. Its shortage in the late 19th century was considered an emergency of international import. The design of the ATD book cover has the text doubled as though we are reading it through a piece of Iceland Spar. The crystal is mentioned and riffed upon repeatedly in the text, and we even have one of the sections of the novel named after it. This crystal and its properties are obviously something TP means us to notice. We have many mirrors reflecting the world, characters are bilocated, Tesla is contrasted with Edison...If multiple dimensions, multiple possible worlds exist beside one another, with only tissue-thin walls between them, what happens to the factual and the counter-factual? What happens to the True? It was certainly interesting to come across issues of doubling again so soon after finishing Miss MacIntosh My Darling... The difference between TP and MY is that TP is an engineer, a scientist, a lover of gears and cogs and equations and electrons and oil-stained fingers. MY, on the other hand, writes from some cloud-cluttered height, a place of light and dreaming and utopias in the sky. TP's Anarchists are farcical, or at least the world around them is, MY's have a nobility and a loftiness of purpose. TP sees Being as mediated by technology, MY seeks the unmediated Soul. TP also loves the low-brow: smut; puns; and sexcapades of countless types. I am fond of a good dick joke or two, so love that about him. MY can be witty, but I would be suprised to find a dirty joke in her work... The temporal location of ATD is also key, of course, when technical progress and unfettered imagination seemed to promise other worlds, radical changes to human nature and society. Until, sadly, 1914, when humanity woke up, face down in the mud. The hangover would continue to worsen right up to the present day. \"You have been so easy to fool - most of you anyway - you are such simpletons at the fair, gawking at your Wonders of Science, expecting as your entitlement all the Blessings of Progress, it is your faith, your pathetic balloon-boy faith.\" I loved the idea that the great weight of all the dead from WWI, all that trauma, was dense and violent enough to fracture time. It certainly fractured History. It certainly fractured Art. There were moments in this book, and most acutely during a scene late in the story involving statues of the Angel of Death, that I felt genuine fear for these people and their world because of what was coming (and, of course, the fear was really for the \"real\"world and all those millions of \"real\" people) - I have never had that sensation while reading before. It has lingered with me all day. It is certainly a powerful work which can re-create, can summon up, that kind of dread, that kind of acknowledgment of all the blood and suffering which began precisely 100 years ago. ************* To finish, a little bit of TP prose: \"After passengers for Telluride had changed at Ridgway Junction, the little stub train climbed up over Dallas Divide and rolled down again to Placerville and the final haul up the valley of the San Miguel, through sunset and into the uncertainties of night. The high-country darkness, with little to break it but starlight off the flow of some creek or a fugitive lamp or hearth up in a miner's cabin, soon gave way to an unholy radiance ahead, in the east. It was the wrong color for fire, and daybreak was out of the questions, though the end of the world remained a possibility. It was in fact the famous electric street-lighting of Telluride, first city in the U.S. to be so lit, and Frank recalled that his kid brother, Kit, had worked for a while on the project of bringing the electricity for it up from Ilium Valley. The great peaks first sighted yesterday across the Uncompahgre Plateau, snaggletoothing in a long line up over the southern horizon, now announced themselves at every hand, fearsomely backlit, rearing before the gazes of the passengers, who had begun to rubberneck out at the spreading radiance, chattering like a carful of tourists from back east.\" This little passage, from around page 300 or so, and selected pretty randomly, gives a pretty good example of Pynchon's technique and his skill. He dances between the lyrical, the satirical, the geographical and the historical with breath-taking ease. He knows landscape, he knows people and he knows the history of both. He moves effortlessly between the language of the elite and the language of the street, often within the bounds of a single sentence. Personally I would be happy to simply sit at his feet and listen to him give birth to Story for the rest of my life. Here's hoping he has at least another big, masterful book in him. ...more This is a very difficult book to assail and digest but worth it for me to see how the pomo master keeps up with the scene of post-postmodern he has spawned.

There is something in it for most readers (mystery, espionage, fantasy, historical fiction, family saga, campy humor, philosophy, mathematics), and in that sense there is too much in it for most readers. Too rich. Like reading 3-4 of those other authors in a row. The same was true for \u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow\u201d, a masterpiece of comparable scope which took me a few years to complete. Jeeze, can it be back some 40 years ago? It\u2019s hard to believe that Pynchon, one of the key fathers of postmodernism, has still got the juices. Here we get the same MO of personifying entropy and forces of physics into history. And plenty of mind-bending forays and obsessive quests by a troupe of comic and tragic characters performing the kaleidoscopic dance for our delight and wonder. Only this time around we don\u2019t take mescaline any more. What is he doing here to mess with our minds? This time he more after the relations of reality to math than to physics per se, and instead of World War 2 as the mental crucible, he is concerned with the fateful collision of burgeoning modernity at the end of the 19th century with the vortex of forces at play after the turn of the 20th century that leads to World War 1. Though it didn\u2019t take me years to finish, I did take took a refreshing month-long break in the middle. There are some truly loveable characters here worth staying the course for, more so I think than in Gravity\u2019s Rainbow. Others in my reading group should take heart that long pauses can make for a feasible strategy. Jules Verne gave us 80 days to travel around the world, but with this book as a travel itinerary Pynchon does it in 25 plus years span (and 10 years to write). From the book jacket: Spanning the period between the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and the years just after World War I, this novel moves from the labor troubles in Colorado to turn-of-the-century New York, to London and Gottingen, Venice and Vienna, the Balkans, Central Asia, Siberia at the time of the mysterious Tunguska Event, Mexico during the Revolution, postwar Paris, silent-era Hollywood, and one or two places not strictly speaking on the map at all. I love it how Pynchon kicks off the book by bringing a lot of his key characters together in Chicago at the beginning and then disperses them about the globe. At the World Exposition in 1893, all the great wonders of modern science and industry are on display. There we experience the arrival of a crew in the dirigible The Inconvenience , the cartoonish \u201cChums of Chance\u201d, who we learn fly around the world on secret missions handed down by a mysterious Upper Hierarchy. They are the epitome of youthful and plucky gung-ho for technology in the service of progress and adventure. Their assignment has something to do with Tesla, who is working on wireless communication and hopes to create a source of free electricity for the world. We meet a key enemy of the story, the slimy magnate Scarsdale Vibe, who desires only economic exploitation of such wonders. He funds a Professor Vanderjuice to beat Tesla at the game and a young Tesla assistant, Kit Traverse, to study at Yale the type of math most relevant to his lucrative schemes. There you have the historical thrust of the innocent and the corrupt of this tale in a nutshell. Aside from Kit, other loveable characters we meet on scene in Chicago are a traveling photographer and electrical appliance handyman, Merle Rideout, and his brilliant adventuresome daughter Dahlia (Dally). Then there is the righteous detective Lewis Basnight, working to outsmart possible anarchist bombers. I don\u2019t count the five members of the Chums of Chance as \u201cloveable\u201d as they remain caricatures of their titles (Captain, Communications Officer/Historian, Scientific Officer, Handyman Apprentice, Mascot, plus the literary dog Pugnax as a protector and oracle). Finally, we run across some important minor characters, a pair of Austrian government agents who are guarding and keeping out of trouble the young Archduke. Yes, the very one whose assassination by a Serbian agent triggered the Austrian response and cascade of treaty obligations as the onset of World War 1. Much of the book is a form of foreshadowing of this coming conflagration. Soon the Chums of Chance fly away to tune into an Arctic exploratory mission that has a lot to do with finding a form of calcite known as Iceland Spar. It has the property of double refraction that holds out the prospect of a window into an alternate reality. Before we get to the house of cards in Europe, we take a diversion to Colorado, where Merle and Dally soon end up and Lew somewhat later. Merle\u2019s chemistry skills from photography and his handyman talents lands him work in the mining industry through a new friendship with the miner Webb Traverse, father of the math whiz Kitt whom we met in Chicago. We expand our key characters with Kitt\u2019s older siblings, including the happy-go-lucky gambler, Reef, the pragmatic mining school student, Frank, and their wild, boy crazy teenager sister, Lake. Lew comes to town on the trail of anarchist threats to the railroads owned by his corporate masters and makes a modest transition to countering the subversive forces aligned with the mining unions. From the conditions of the workers, the dirty tricks and violent tactics of thugs enforcing the greedy corporations, and his growing friendship with pro-union Merle, Lew begins to question whether he is on the right side. Colorado makes a great stage to wind-up and solidify the characters and to display a nexus of historical forces. Manifest Destiny has closed the wilderness, the Indians are all out of the way on reservations, and capitalism has a free hand to apply new technologies to exploit the environment big time and the muscle of legal and extra-legal means to ride herd over the workers, which includes a lot of foreign immigrants with socialist fervor. The balance is upset by the entropic monkey wrench of the anarchists, who get pretty bold with their dynamite craze. Soon a lot of folks take up dynamite as a personal means of self expression and empowerment. Tall tales emerge of a mysterious Kieselguhr Kid, named after clay that stabilizes nitro in dynamite, as evident in this gossip: \u201cDon\u2019t carry pistols, don\u2019t even own a shotgun nor a rifle\u2014no, his trade-mark, what you\u2019ll find him packing in those tooled holsters, is always these twin sticks of dynamite \u2026 Couple dozen in big bandoliers across his chest.\u201d \u2026\u201dBut say, couldn\u2019t even a slow hand just gun him down before he could get a fuse lit?\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t bet on it. Got this clever wind-proof kind of strike rig on to each holster, like a safety match, so all\u2019s he has to do\u2019s draw, and the sucker\u2019s all lit and ready to throw\u2026 Even old Butch Cassidy and them\u2019ll begin to coo like a barn full of pigeons whenever the Kid\u2019s in the county.\u201d A critical event happens that ends up indirectly sending all the key characters off in different pathways through the rest of the novel. Without saying who or why, I share the modest spoiler that Webb gets murdered. All of the brothers are forever after motivated toward avenging his death while at times actively dodging this duty. Lake runs off with a flashy scumbag, unaware of his connections with the corporate bad guys. Lew gets on the dangerous bad side of the dark forces and takes the opportunity of a quick escape to London. The travels and quests of our characters will continually intersect the shadowy forces that drive the missions of the Chums of Chance and that of various nations\u2019 spy networks concerned with harnessing advances in math and science for the development of powerful new weapons. The Traverse family saga is loads of fun, full of naughty bits, and replete with feats of derring-do that knits their fate with that of the world. Frank and Reef wander around the west looking for a target for their revenge, and in the long course of events Frank ends up in Mexico in the middle of their revolution while Reef gets in the middle of the Balkan conflicts that preceded World War 1. Meanwhile, Kit pursues math studies in Gottingen, where he bonds with fellow math whiz, Yashneen, the daughter of an important English spy and Russian mother. They soon are led into significant forays in Austria and Belgium, and then he assumes a quest that takes him through Central Asia to Siberia as she joins Reef on the Balkan escapades. As for Dahlia, she converges with Lew in London, where he is adapting his detective skills to espionage, and then she ends up in Venice, where she gets involved with the ferment of the arts and part of the draw that makes this city a home base of sorts for Kitt. Yes, this is all quite dizzying, but Pynchon weaves a very satisfying web, and it becomes clear why places like Bosnia, Venice, and Belgium are favored sites to portray the fateful transformations between the 19th and 20th centuries. Bosnia is obvious as its annexation by Austria in 1908 kicked off an uproar among world powers, particularly with the Ottoman Empire which had held it as a Muslim province on Western Europe\u2019s doorstep for five centuries. Venice is an ancient link between Europe and Asia, home of Marco Polo, the capital of one of the first nation states, a leading center of the Renaissance, and for long periods in history a part of the Austrian Empire. With its traditions of carnival and masked balls and ancient tradition of mapping and mirror making, it makes a great site for romance and intrigue for Pynchon. Belgium, which figures in the book as a site of dual conventions of anarchists and radical mathematicians, is a lowland county whose sea walls are metaphorically depicted as barely hold back the suffering from King Leopold\u2019s colonialism in the Congo. It is foreshadowed as the future pathway for German invasion of France and site of the long slaughter at Yypres. The spying Belgian security police captain looks for significant connections between the two sets of conventioneers: \u201cThey could turn out to be only innocent mathematicians, I suppose,\u201d muttered Woevre\u2019s section officer, de Decker. \u201cOnly.\u201d Woevre was amused. \u201cSomeday you\u2019ll explain to me how that\u2019s possible. Seeing that, on the face of it, all mathematics leads, doesn\u2019t it, sooner or later, to some kind of human suffering.\u201d Again and again we circle around mathematical advances and the competition between the Quaternionists and the Vectorists. The average reader can be sorely mystified and perplexed as to how much of this is a parody of academics and how much a real contributor to the forces of history. The progress of math to make use of dimensions beyond the three of conventional reality and of imaginary numbers whose terms incorporate the square root of -1 did pave the way for use as tools for progress of physics in Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. For example, the treatment of time as the fourth dimension in a geometry known as Minkowski Space was an ideal way for Einstein to portray the effects of gravity on space. However, in most ways mathematical innovations are just a useful tool for description of reality and not translatable into altered perspectives on fundamental aspects of reality. In this sense, the search for invisible realities, sources of energy, doorways through time in the extra dimensions and imaginary numbers of mathematical systems is just an endearing lunacy. Even so, the prospect of new weapons coming out of these academic fields presages the obvious fulfillment later in the century on their predictions of the powerful energies that might be released from splitting the atom. In retrospect, the allure is plausible: It is said that the inventor of this weapon has found a way to get inside the scalar part of a Quaternion, where invisible powers may be had for the taking. And in this age of bizarre spiritualism at the end of the Romanticism (based on a recent historical reading of Chaos Imagined , there would likely thoughtful folks who would align the science with the mysticism of Tarot and the Hindu Atman and Shiva and come up with the potential for bifurcated lifelines, for co-consciousness, and for parallel universes, such as in this projection: Deep among the equations describing the behavior of light, Vector and Quaternion equations, lies a set of directions, an itinerary, a map to a hidden space. Double refraction appears again and again as a key element, permitting a view into a Creation set just to the side of this one, so close as to overlap, where the membrane between the worlds, in many places, has become too frail, too permeable, for safety. \u2026Within the mirror, within the scalar term, within the daylight and obvious and taken-for-granted has always lain, as if in wait, the dark itinerary, the corrupted pilgrim\u2019s guide, the nameless Station before the first, in the lightless uncreated, where salvation does not yet exist. The Chums of Chance flying above all the madness below somehow maintain their innocence despite contracting with various governmental powers. Their adventures extend to a search for the invisible or underground Asian city of Shambhala and efforts to counter interventions of time travelers from the future, wavering between the flavors of Lovecraft and Steampunk (e.g. Pullman\u2019s \u201cGolden Compass\u201d and Westerfield\u2019s \u201cLeviathan\u201d). Sometimes these madcap elements wore thin, but usually it was a relief to come back to them from the intense drama and struggles of the \u201creal\u201d characters. I was uplifted how, when World War 1 finally came to pass, they largely flew above the fray, so to speak, and punched out to the other side with even more optimism and ambition than they started with. The same is true for many of the Traverse and Rideout clans, as we bid a fine farewell to them in sunny California. Don\u2019t you love it when you go through hell and still reach a happy ending? ...more This might very well end up being my favorite Pynchon novel.

I would place this next to Gravity's Rainbow as his two most ambitious novels, but there's something about Against the Day that I like better. In many ways it's like reading a massive young-adult novel, there's just such a sense of outright fun and adventure about it (I read many parts of it with a big world atlas open on my lap, following the characters journeys). In Gravity's Rainbow Pynchon is always striving to express things beyond the confines of the book, which gives it a tremendous sense of urgency, like he had direct experience of a reality that just couldn't be put into words. Against the Day lacks this urgency, though there's still the keen interest in a reality beyond the normal everyday, but there's also more of a detachment on Pynchon's part, which makes reading it less stressful (Gravity's Rainbow has a tendency to make me paranoid while reading it) and simply enjoyable, while still satisfying the desire for alternative realities. ...more I can't even begin to write a review of this massive, impressive work.

Although there were times I thought I'd never finish it, I couldn't put it down. Hopefully, I'll write a review in the future. Just a few words, on reflection. The theme of day/night, light/dark was never clear to me (no pun intended) although the references to these topics are profuse and obviously have meaning. It seems, writing as a first guess, that the light is dangerous and that life lived against the day has more integrity. However, moved as I was by the imagery, I was not able to reach a clear understanding of the theme. There are an amazing number of characters and events in the novel. Clearly, anarchism is important as well as capitalism and greed. The story is played out over several continents and decades, from the Chicago's World Fair in 1893 through the first World War. The characters travel through Asia, Europe and America's \"wild west.\" The prose can be hauntingly lovely (as well as rambunctiously obscene) and although I was often baffled by the book, I was entranced by the writing and the feeling of meaning just out of my reach. ...more Some works are so densely, elaborately planned and plotted that any map to their intricacies would necessarily be longer than the work itself. This, I think, is the justification and promise of post-modern literature, with works reaching further in all directions and via as many tools as possible.

This, I think, is the justification and promise of post-modern literature, with works reaching further in all directions and via as many tools as possible. Against the Day is one such work: almost any given line or action may upon study be split, like light through a prism, into a full spectrum of significant motifs. And so Against the Day serves as a refracted history (beginning in history's common beam, yet bent slightly away) of how the bright promise and \"unshaped freedom\" of the turn of the century was \"rationalized into movement only in straight lines and at right angles and a progressive reduction of choices, until the the final turn through the final gate that led to the killing floor\" of the 20th century's Great Wars. The quoted lines refer to the stockyards of the novel's opening setting and microcosm: Chicago, 1893, with the \"White City\" of the World's Columbian Exposition running into the stockyards where cattle that once roamed the western plains unfettered were brought to slaughter. This history is told mainly through the broad social forces of labor, capitalism, and anarchy all bumping against one another, violently or not, across thirty years and hundreds of significant characters. But these motifs blend and overlap with the concurrent history of math and physics, so it is also a book about electricity, about bilocations, about vectors and quaternions and graspings at academic fourth dimensions (and so, briefly, time travel), and, pervasively about light, which so suffuses every corner of the work that I could resist picking its up its language here. But fortunately, despite the complex conceptual wash, and as with V , Pynchon is fairly clear in laying out his palette -- fortunately since this nearly 1100-page supernova is rather more densely interconnected than the thematic dichotomies of V , even as it spews (seemingly?) extraneous material in all directions. Against the Day is certainly among Pynchon's best (in fact, it would be a reasonable starting point for new readers, if not for sheer length), but it's also Pynchon: digressive, intermittently plotted, and full of references that fly straight by me or will require considerable additional consideration to fit into a relevant spot in the workings. But what makes this novel burn so brightly is that even with this cast of hundreds, the book is largely carried out by believable, memorable characters capable of leading the reader through even the most absurd or divergent mirrored funhouse halls. ...more During those simpler, happy times (the Democrats assumed control of the House and matters appeared to be changing)I pre-ordered the novel with my happy local bookseller.

My friends had selected Against The Day for our winter read and I read the novel in two lengthy slogs, finding it necessary to reread several sections. Some of my friends weren't as ecstatic. I still found the Chums of Chance an ace device for observing a world spinning out of control: for the first decade of the 21st Century as well as their own. Our expectations will always be thwarted. The system will encircle our most valued motives and commodify such. This will continue until heat death snuffs out the flame. Entropy and Ossification remains Pynchonian archtypes and much of this is explored here through scattered paternity and the menace of mechanization. I bought a copy a few years ago for my wife's sister during a most happy christmas and I have pondered since that the novel certainly DEMANDS a second reading.

He\u2019d done all the Chums books he had been carrying with him in any case, so it was time to move on to something different. And now that his nightly reading functioned more as a sort of gloomy serenade to his dead father than anything else it seemed reading material was inconsequential. It wasn't even for pleasure anymore, because it was fun or anything: it was like Webb was sitting right there next to him, could hear every word he was saying, even judging him: \u201cwhy ain\u2019t you out there blowin up railroads, son? you ain\u2019t even got them yet, have you?\u201d Over the next two months, Reef read, or rather serenaded, to his dead father, and the more he read the more he sensed Webb\u2019s presence in the room, and not spiritually either, but genuinely, really there, Reef feeling more and more strangled, even oppressed, as if his father\u2019s ghost had him in a chokehold. Upon finally finishing the book, Reef, with some struggle, took a deep breath, halfway into which he began coughing violently, as if a mosquito had flown straight down his throat (hell, maybe one did ). He fell to his knees on the wooden floor, coughed some more, and after that one last liberating cough, there he stood, right in front of him: that wasn\u2019t no ghost, that was his father. \u201cPa, shit.

In fact, it seemed damn-near impossible. \u201cAlright, Pa. Well, shit. I hardly know where to begin.

The oppressive air gone, Reef breathing freely again for the first time in two months, feeling relaxed, having finished this mammoth of a book and the constraint on his throat alleviated, no longer feeling like he was living in a stultified world, or rather he was at least aware that he was, he was free to do what he did best. He went out the door, down the stairs and out of the saloon, dynamite in his backpack, the sun gleaming down onto his face, ready to get back to business again \u2013 ready to blow shit up, like the Kieselguhr kid. ...more This is a rather long read, but I, for my part, will be brief.

It is a book in the tradition of the \"literature of exhaustion,\" John Barth's term for a genre that -- with its learning, lists and lore -- willfully taxonomizes a world, teaching along the way and capturing, in multiple storylines and legions of characters, a different view of life from the linear one we expect from, say, Trollope and some other \"traditional\" novelist.

At any rate, here are some quotes that should explain what I mean better than I can. I've never been able to write a decent Pynchon review. \"The Professor was literally having an attack of nausea. Every time Tesla's name came up, this was the predictable outcome. Vomit.

Answering the question, how can anyone set off a bomb that will take innocent lives?' 'Long fuse,' . . . 'Think about it . . . like Original Sin, only with exceptions. Being born into this don't automatically make you innocent. But when you reach a point in your life where you understand who is fucking who--beg pardon, Lord--who's taking it and who's not, that's when you're obliged to choose how much you'll go along with. If you are not devoting every breath of every day waking and sleeping to destroying those who slaughter the innocent as easy as signing a check, then how innocent are you willing to call yourself? It must be negotiated with the day, from those absolute terms.'\" \"'La Mayonnaise has its origins in the moral squalor of the court of Louis XV--here in Belgium the affinity should not be too surprising.

One might usefully compare Cl\u00e9o de M\u00e9rode and the marquise de Pompadour.

The streetlighting carried, for those, such as Neville and Nigel, who could hear it, the luminous equivalent of a steady, afflicted shriek.\" \"Up into the Karst, to a vineyard gate and an osmizza just inside that served meals and wine, the lights of Trieste far below, a wine ancient before Illyria, nameless, wind-finished, ethereal in its absence of color.

We harness and sodomize them, photograph their degradation, send them up onto the high iron and down into mines and sewers and killing floors, we set them beneath inhuman loads, we harvest from them their muscle and eyesight and health, leaving them in our kindness a few miserable years of broken gleanings. Of course we do. Why not? They are good for little else. How likely are they to grow to their full manhood, become educated, engender families, further the culture or the race? We take what we can while we may. Look at them--they carry the mark of their absurd fate in plain sight. Their foolish music is about to stop, and it is they who will be caught out, awkwardly, most of them tone-deaf and never to be fully aware, few if any with the sense to leave the game early and seek refuge before it is too late. Perhaps there will not, even by then, be refuge. . . .

I really like it!\" If these guys and girls had been paying attention they would not have tortured themselves writing a review of this novel because Thomas Pynchon himself has a review of this, buried practically incognito on page 956 of my copy. Here Vlado gave to Yashmeen a book entitled \"The Book of the Masked\" and Pynchon describes it like he would have described this novel: \"(Its) pages were filled with encrypted field-notes and occult scientific passages of a dangerousness one could at least appreciate, though more perhaps for what it promised than for what it presented in such impenetrable code, its sketch of a mindscape whose layers emerged one on another as from a mist, a distant country of painful complexity, an all but unmappable flow of letters and numbers that passed into and out of the guise of the other, not to mention images, from faint and spidery sketches to a full spectrum of inks and pastels, of what Vlado had been visited by under the assaults of his home wind, of what could not be paraphrased even into the strange holiness of Old Slavonic script, visions of the unsuspected, breaches in the Creation where something else had had a chance to be luminously glimpsed. Ways in which God chose to hide within the light of day, not a full list, for the list was probably endless, but chance encounters with details of God's unseen world.\" Read it again. For that would be the common experience you'll have in its paragraphs and passages so that with the rereading you'll be doing the novel could very well become like 2,000 pages and not just 1,220. Now, why have I rated this 5 stars? Because of its last seven paragraphs. Seven paragraphs the meaning of which I do not know, which I can't say I understand, full of the usual impossibilities and exaggerations, the simultaneous pregnancies, of the balloon-ship which has grown as big as a city, the talking dogs, the dog who reads Henry James, the scientific mumbo-jumbo, the trips to nowhere, all these--for reasons I do not know--had left me misty-eyed: \"One day Heartsease discovers that she's expecting a baby, and then, like a canonical part-song, the other girls one by one announce that they are, too. \"And on they fly. The ship by now has grown as large as a small city. There are neighborhoods, there are parks. There are slum conditions. It is so big that when people on the ground see it in the sky, they are struck with selective hysterical blindness and end up not seeing it at all. \"Its corridors will begin to teem with children of all ages and sizes who run up and down the different decks whooping and hollering. The more serious are learning to fly the ship, others, never cut out for the Sky, are only marking time between visits to the surface, understanding that their destinies willl be down in the finite world. \"'Inconvenience' herself is constantly having her engineering updated. As a result of advances in relativity theory, light is incorporated as a source of motive power--though not exactly fuel--and as a carrying medium--though not exactly a vehicle--occupying, rather, a relation to the skyship much like that of the ocean to a surfer on a surfboard--a design principle borrowed from the AEther units that carry the girls to and fro on missions whose details they do not always share fully with 'High Command.' \"As the sails of her destiny can be reefed against too much light, so they may also be spread to catch a favorable darkness. Her ascents are effortless now. It is no longer a matter of gravity--it is an acceptance of sky. \"The contracts which the crew have been signing lately, under Darby's grim obsessiveness, grow longer and longer, eventually overflowing the edges of the main table in the mess decks, and occasionally they find themselves engaged to journey very far afield indeed. They return to Earth--unless it is Counter-Earth--with a form of 'mnemonic frostbite,' retaining only awed impressions of a ship exceeding the usual three dimensions, docking, each time precariously, at a series of remote stations high in unmeasured outer space, which together form a road to a destination--both ship and dockage hurtling at speeds that no one wishes to imagine, invisible sources of gravity rolling through like storms, making it possible to fall for distances only astronomers are comfortable with--yet, each time, the 'Inconvenience' is brought to safety, in the bright, flowerlike heart of a perfect hyper-hyperboloid that only Miles can see in its entirety. \"Pugnax and Ksenji's generations--at least in every litter will follow a career as a sky-dog--have been joined by those of other dogs, as well as by cats, birds, rodents, and less-terrestial forms of life. Never sleeping, clamorous as a nonstop feast day, 'Inconvenience,' once a vehicle of sky-pilgrimage, has transformed into its own destination, where any wish that can be made is at least addressed, if not always granted. For every wish to come true would mean that in the known Creation, good unsought and uncompensated would have evolved somehow, to become at least more accessible to us. No one aboard 'Inconvenience' has yet observed any sign of this. They know--Miles is certain--it is there, like an approaching rainstorm, but invisible. Soon they will see the pressure-gauge begin to fall. They will feel the turn in the wind. They will put on smoked goggles for the glory of what is coming to part the sky. They fly toward grace.\" ...more It took me a month to finish this book, and when I was done with all 1,085 pages I had expected to feel relieved, even ebullient.

Instead, I was kind of sad it was over. This is a beautiful, moving book, very sad but also very silly. It's one of the easiest Pynchon books to understand, along with Mason and Dixon, and one of the easiest to get through, in part because it doesn't have large sections that are really really sad and twisted, as is the case with Gravity's Rainbow and V (one of my all-time favorites). I disagree with the critics who say Pynchon doesn't create characters you can sink your teeth into; I felt that his characters (and there are a LOT of them) are so poignant and sad I don't think I could have made it through this book if I'd they'd been any more fully developed. Having said all that, it's not exactly like reading Janet Evanovitch. Pynchon is a literary treasure but he doesn't really \"write books\" like other professional authors. He doesn't really create a plot, which is maybe why his books are so long. He just keeps going until, I guess, either he gets exhausted or his publisher makes him turn it in or, I dunno, his printer breaks down. It helps to know a few things going into this book. It helps, actually, if you can keep a laptop with WiFi next to you while you read so you look stuff up as you go along. But, some tips that might help (and I\"m sure I\"ll forget or miss a bunch, so anyone who reads this should feel free to add more in 'comments') First, Pynchon is easiest to read if you don't come to it with an expectation of a normal story arc and normal plot development. There isn't a beginning middle and end, really, and only one character (Cyprian) has a classic epiphany. Don't try to find one, or you'll be disappointed. Just read and enjoy every page as it comes to you. Trust me, you'll find yourself getting totally involved in what's happening. There are so many many characters and they all speak in a kind of distinctive voice, I found it helpful to assign a well-known actor to many of the recurring characters. The Chums of Chance, for example, seem like utter twits until you try reading Darby in a Denis Leary voice and Chick Counterfly in an Owen Wilson voice. For the evil Scarsdale Vibe I used Christopher Walken and for his sidekick Foley Walker I found John Heard (remember him from Big and the Milagro Beanfield Wars?). Curiously, I could never find actors to fit the supposed three main characters of the book, the three Traverse boys. Somehow they seemed the least coherent of all the characters in this book. Everyone will tell you this is a wacky travel tale about anarchists and corporate greed. I didn't think so. I think it was basically kind of an existential book; there are all these characters searching desperately for redemption in a world that's completely chaotic and out of control and heartless. In the end the ones who find it, find it in love (yes, can you believe it? In Thomas Pynchon?) and in the trivial details of everyday life. Over and over the most insightful characters repeat that it's love and trivia that are the only refuge from life. But that doesn't stop all these characters from trying to find redemption in insane areas. Math and science, for example. You always feel like you need a pHd in physics when you read pynchon. But in a way, he makes all the math and science nerds the bad guys; they've gotten too involved in things that are too refined. There are SOME science things you need to know, though. But before I get into them, i have to go feed my family dinner, an act that is trivial and loving. ...more Is it ok if I get a lil\u2019 pretentious on your asses?

Reading this book is a lot like travelling along the Riemann zeta function that Pynchon seems so fond of. Locally, we travel small coherent distances, moving round a logical path, but when we zoom out and observe the story globally, we see how convoluted and complex it really is. Cutting a vertical cross-section through the function, we'll see the same sets of characters and storylines sometimes, but a lot of empty space where we're on our own. You can read tens, twenties of pages of this book that are like small packets of story that make sense, but go any further and you\u2019ll get completely lost. Here we see Pynchon older (I didn\u2019t say mature), more relaxed, and off drugs, and so are his characters for the most part. Also they\u2019ve stopped multiplying, in more than one way: there\u2019s only 100+ of them instead of the 400+ of Gravity's Rainbow for eg., and they have significantly less sex (thankfully- TP\u2019s \u2018lovemaking\u2019 scenes make Fifty Shades look like marital missionary!) Sometimes, when they make a second, third? What? Fourth appearance? You even remember their names! Great! Those were exactly the changes I wanted from GR, and yet I still like GR more, only because of its more enjoyable settings as well as my own stubbornness and first Pynchon nostalgia (oh, last year! How long \u2018twas ago lawl) Still we see his traditional format of writing from a talent tower above all other novelists, but with his mind in the gutter. Also you\u2019ll read familiar themes of predestination, the futility of war, unconventional love, yadda yadda and plenty of silly songs too. Spoiler alert: not a single kazoo this time! Although I did find the ijk, vector, quaternion chat (and Tesla cameo was stoopid) a bit aimless and reminded me of my least favourite Pynchon trait, the interjection of showy-off academic chat that almost deliberately excludes you from having fun with him. Yeah, Joyce \u2019s ideal reader was himself, but that wasn\u2019t a good thing, dude (or wazzit or wizzit I gettit). Nonetheless, it\u2019s hard not to be charmed by big P\u2019s playful genre-hopping neither- boy\u2019s adventure novel runs into hardboiled crime begets\u2026 is that supposed to be Henry James ? At least this time you can celebrate your own cleverness as well as his. And some sections could even be described as\u2026 sweet. Good on you mate. I\u2019ll read the rest, too :D ...more This was excellent, so much so that I was tempted to add it to my ever-growing list of favorites (query: if your list of favorite books exceeds a certain number, say, 100 or so, are they still your favorites, or does it at some point just become a list of books you really like?

Like have 18 best friends or something; surely \"best\" implies a very small number? But I digress). In the end I didn't add it, though I think it is definitely in the running for best Pynchon novel, because it started to bag for me somewhere in the 800s. I think most of the Cyprian sections were somehow not my thing; I could simply have done without him. Your mileage, of course, may vary. Also, and perhaps I am alone in this, I was happier with a Pynchon who didn't write quite so many sex scenes. Even the slower bits, though, were completely forgivable, because fundamentally what counts is that sentence by sentence, every page is a sheer pleasure. The joy in language, the playfulness and fun of it, is evident in every sentence, baggy or not, and for me this is the difference between an author I can admire and one I can love. The older I get, the more this playfulness matters to me, and Pynchon seems to really get that. (I envision him eavesdropping on conversations in cafes around the world, taking mental notes of the ways that people talk, gleefully amassing a vast array of strategies for later use. And hey, you'd never know if that was him at the next table, would you?) I reconfirm that for me, literature is about making art out of the medium of language. Other things may be entertainment, may be valuable and necessary, but they're not capital-L literature, and they'll never be my first and foremost. Reading this has also made me want to go back and re-read Mason and Dixon (also in the running for best Pynchon, imho), as well as to read for the first time the two big ones I never did read at all, GR and Vineland. At the same time, it's made me want to crawl off into a hole of fast-reading genre fiction, because between this and Calvino and a better but harder job, I feel pretty tired. Even as I feel this wish, I know that Pynchon is the better writer, objectively, for all time, and that even my lower appetites are still a big book snob. Perhaps a break, and then back to the really good books, of which this is definitely one. _______________________________ From the WSJ review by Alexander Theroux: \"To read this book with anything like comprehension, a person has to be, like its polymath author, both intellectual and hip, a person mature and profoundly well read and yet something of a true marginal, a word-nerd with the patience of Job.

Now reading it isn't even remotely close to accomplishing something like getting Mumia Abu-Jamal out of jail, but it still feels like an accomplishment anyway. If Turgenev's \"Fathers and Sons\" (1861) was the 1st novel w/ an anarchistic protaganist (the main character, Rudin, was drawn partly from the young Bakunin who Turgenev was friends w/), then we've already had a healthy history of 157 yrs of novels w/ at least somewhat positively presented anarchist characters. These might include: Isabel Meredith (Helen & Olivia Rossetti)'s 1903 \"A Girl Among the Anarchists\", Frank Harris' 1909 \"The Bomb\" (about the Haymarket Martyrs), &, more recently, G. A. Matiasz's 1994 \"End Time - Notes on the Apocalypse\". I'd even be tempted to toss in Mario Vargas Llosa's 1981 \"The War of the End of the World\" but I can also easily imagine a case being made to vehemently deny that one! Pynchon's, however, is even more epic than the Vargas Llosa, & definitely written from a pro-anarchist perspective. For me, reading it was sometimes uncanny. The 1st bk I read of his was \"The Crying of Lot 49\" - I probably read it sometime in the mid 1970s. I liked it, but I wasn't as enthralled by it as I might've been lead to believe I wd be by whoever might've recommended it. Then, in 1979, I was co-running an anonymous phone project called \"TESTES-3\" & a reporter named Franz Lidz wrote about it & compared it to the Tristero in Pynchon's novel. 15 yrs later, I was living in Berlin & reading Pynchon's \"Gravity's Rainbow\" while spending much or most of my time in the whereabouts of the English Tiergarten where much of the novel's action was taking place. That seemed oddly synchronous. NOW, being an anarchist & having finished writing a math bk (of sorts) several wks ago, I read Pynchon's latest about.. anarchist mathematicians (amongst many other folks too of course) & the synchronicity just kept kicking in right & left. One of the characters is going to a certain part of the world & I'm thinking something like: Hhhmm, I wonder if one of the people there will have the same name as my exgirlfriend from there? &, uh, Lo & Behold!, yes, there she is! One of the many threads running thru it all is ballooning - my 1st job in Pittsburgh was w/ a ballooning company. None of this tells you much about the novel, I'm just trying to explain my own resonance w/ it. THE NOVEL: Well, of course, reading it requires a substantial investment of time that might be better spent in something more actively engaged w/ the world. Nonetheless, if you're going to read a novel, this wd probably be, IMO, considerably less of a waster of time than reading anything by Stephen King - something that 100s of millions of people do all the time. The packaging of the bk is decorated w/ reviewer accolades who, for the most part, avoid telling their readership that the bk flagrantly supports anarchist assassinations of the genocidally power-hungry & the lot. That, in itself, interests me. Do they avoid it in order to bypass their more propaganda oriented publication's editorial strategies? To get past the editors? Or is it the editors who impose the restriction? Or do they somehow just not notice & see it as all good fictional fun? Because, while it is an entertaining bk set ca 100 yrs ago, its political message is still as relevant as ever. ...more Some adjectives to describe \u2018Against the Day\u2019: Historical; futuristic; fantastical; gritty; witty; epic; adventurous; philosophical; lusty, scientific; learned; surreal; dense; playful; sociological; hallucinogenic; relentless; ambitious; funny, theological and licentious.

(One of the conceits I particularly liked is that their adventures are collected together elsewhere in a different set of books hugely popular in a parallel universe.) In the first hundred pages or so they meet a group of characters whose lives we then follow, as well as some other characters they themselves come in contact with. If I had a criticism it\u2019s that I\u2019m not sure it all pulls together as a whole at the end, but the ride to get there is extremely satisfying. This is a very long book and clearly won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s tastes.
