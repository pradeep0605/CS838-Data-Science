Abducted from her village in West Africa at the age of eleven and marched in a coffle (a string of slaves) for three months before reaching the coast, Aminata survives the voyage to America and ends up sold to an indigo plantation owner in South Carolina. She describes herself as lucky, because compared to the tragic circumstances and end of so many other black slaves, Aminata manages to survive using her wits, her skills as a midwife, her ability to pick up new skills quickly, and her strength of character. She witnesses many horrors and sorrows, and experiences them as well, that make her ponder the human nature and the hypocrisy of religions, even her own. Yet through it all she does not succumb to anger or hatred; she wants only to be together with her husband, Chekura, and their children, who are all taken from her. When Britain surrenders to the rebels they keep their promise to the Black Loyalists - in a way. With a certificate proving they have worked behind British lines for at least a year, they can sign their name in the Book of Negroes and be given passage to a British colony. Most are sent to Nova Scotia, including Aminata. She may have escaped the American slave owners but she hasn't escaped the prejudice, fear and hatred with which the blacks face everywhere they go. The opportunity to return to Africa - the dream she's always had - comes her way, but if she ever wants to see her home village of Bayo again she'll have to make a deal with the devil. This book is going straight onto my \"favourites\" list. The sweeping, lifelong, cross-generational story arc reminded me of another favourite book of mine, City of Dreams by Beverly Swerling, which is about the early days of the Dutch in Nieuw Amsterdam before it became New York. <+++>The Book of Negroes</+++> is a powerful story on many fronts: it's a very human story, sympathetic, honest, fair to the greys of history, thought-provoking, poignant. One of the beautiful things about this book is how, as a reader, you feel more in tune with the Africans, while the whites seem strange, alien, bewildering, contradictory. I don't mean that Hill paints an uneven picture - far from it, the rendering of history into something visceral, tangible, grants perspective and context. It's not a simple matter of \"white man, bad; black man, victim\". That's what I mean by this book being honest: honest about human nature, about the complexities of history, without making excuses for anyone of any colour. I don't mean that there weren't characters who enrage you, but that they are presented relatively free of the taint of presentism. If you're not familiar with the term, \"presentism\" refers to our natural tendency to judge history through the lens of the present, by our own modern standards, rather than acknowledging and positioning things within a historical perspective. Hill has done an admirable job of completely immersing us in the 18th century, creating a protagonist who is a product of the time as much as one of circumstance. Hill has managed to write a convincing, wonderful female protagonist - frankly, not many male writers are this successful. Aminata is unflinchingly honest with herself and others, and by being so thoroughly in her head, she gives us what the Africans needed most during slavery: a voice, the understanding that she's just like us, not some black beast from darkest Africa - heathen, barbarian, uncivilised. As in some other books, the irony comes through clearly: which is the uncivilised race? Who is the barbarian? When Aminata arrives in London, the first thing she sees are the legless beggars on the street, the filth and crowds and pretensions. She doesn't even need to say anything. Another irony is the rebellion in the American colony - Aminata is in New York when things get nasty, and constantly hears the white Americans talking about being slaves to the British, and fighting for their freedom. Aminata doesn't need to point out anything here, and I don't think I do either. Her own people don't come off smelling of roses either. The book is thoroughly researched and historically accurate, and makes no bones about Africans enslaving each other well before the white people came, and it is Africans who capture Aminata, kill her parents, torch her village, and sell her to the white slavers. Slavery has a long, long history, and no race, it seems, is exempt. The Egyptians did it, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Israelites were famously enslaved, the Romans are guilty - and what is feudalism if not a form of slavery, which the English and French and others used for a very long time? If nothing else, this book highlights the fact that, no matter what colour you are or what your diet is, we are all human and share this intangible thing called human nature. Cruelty exists everywhere, and cannot be simply attributed to your race, though neither can it be excused. This is why I insist that the history of black slavery - while it existed predominantly between the British slaving companies and the Americas - is everyone's history. For a comprehensive story covering three different continents and exposing many of the situations black slaves, runaways and freed slaves faced, you can't go wrong with this one.<---F> It's also beautifully written</---F>. Aminata has a simple, honest style, without embellishment or fanciful detail. She rarely passes judgement, but offers her own thoughts and perspective subtly. She is captured just before reaching puberty and so, ironically, escapes female circumcision, which her people practised (removing the clitoris and part of the labia, and sewing up the vaginal entrance - extraordinarily painful and meant to make a woman \"pure\" for her husband - Aminata isn't keen but doesn't judge; I on the other hand believe it is the cruellest form of torture you can do to a woman and there's no excuse for it. It's an old African tradition, nothing to do with Islam, and still occurs in some places like Ethiopia). There are moments of violence and cruelty, because that was largely the life of the black slaves, but while Aminata doesn't gloss over them, neither does she dwell on them in such detail that you shy away from the book. I was walking one day behind a yoked man who swerved without warning to the left. I had no time to react, and my foot sank into something wet and soft. Something like a twig cracked under my heel. I let out a scream. Under my foot was the body of a naked, decomposing man. I jumped away and ripped leaves from the nearest branch. In a frenzy, I wiped a mass of wriggling white worms from my ankle. I was shaking and wheezing. Fanta took the leaves and wiped my foot and held me and told me not to be afraid. But my hysteria escalated, even though Fanta barked at me to calm down, and I could not stop screaming. (p41) For all that Aminata and other slaves go through, she deserves the right to tell her whole story and not shy from the unpleasant details, or have her account censored. Remember her audience: white, genteel 19th century English men and women, the Abolitionist committee, the court of law, the common people who can read the newspapers in which parts of her story are published. It is the early 1800s, Regency London - the same time and place in which we love to read carefree romance novels that are free of the taint of black slavery - and the English have no real idea or any sympathy for what the black slaves endured. She argued to be the one to write her own story, by herself, and she refused to let the Abolitionists remove details that \"couldn't be proven\". Even though she is a fictional character in a fictional account, she deserves to be heard by us as well. There's one other thing I just have to mention: the evolution of the African-American dialect. I've come to appreciate it because of this book. I mean, I always understood that it was their way of forming a new identity, one that couldn't be taken away from them, even now. But as they learnt English, as slaves, what would happen if they spoke like their masters? Aminata learns this, she learns the dialect that the slaves speak to each other, and the grammatically stronger but far from perfect English they use with the white people. They needed a way to speak to each other without the whites understanding, yet they all came from different African tribes speaking one of thousands of African languages, or they were born on plantations and don't know any African languages at all, and so they devise their own way of speaking, close to English but entirely of their own creation. After Aminata escapes slavery, she drops this dialect and speaks \"proper\" English, but I get the sense it is due to her ability to learn languages quickly and well, and her desire not to be looked down upon, rather than a form of pretension. It certainly makes her a bit of a curiosity with the white people. <+++>The Book of Negroes</+++> is a masterpiece of historical literature, capturing the contradictions of the human condition in graceful, honest prose, and gifting us with a new, entirely sympathetic protagonist.

Aminata Diallo is such a powerful character, a woman who had to deal with so much in her life but came out with a small victory in the end. Slavery is something we all know about but it's very rare we really think about what the slaves went through, and how they were forced to adopt to a new culture and life separated from their family and homeland.<---A>Lawrence Hill</---A> did exceptional work on this book.

The amount of research that was put into motion is clearly evident when you're reading her harrowing journey. You can't help but feel like you went on this journey with her. The story is one of survival and also one where our main character can't call anywhere else \"home.\" Aminata is one character to admire, that's a fact. I'd give this a billion more stars if I could. Such an excellent book!!! I cried tears of sadness and joy all at the same time. Now I can finish watching the rest of the TV show adaptation. The writing is excellent and the story and the characters and just everything about it screams \"classic.\" RATING 5/5 QUOTES I prayed that this was a dream, but the dream would not relent. (33) That, I decided, was what it meant to be a slave: your past didn't matter; in the present you were invisible and you had no claim on the future. (215) I knew that it would be called United States. But I refused to speak that name. There was nothing united about a nation that said all men were created equal, but that kept my people in chains. (349) It's about more than land. It's about freedom. Negroes want to make our own lives. (411) I had learned that there were times when fighting was impossible, when the best thing to do was to wait and to learn. (424) They did not attempt to enslave us, but nor did they set us free. (433) Sometimes a deal with the devil is better than no deal at all. (461) Who was to blame for all this evil, and who had started it? (473) ...more EVERYBODY PLEASE READ THIS BOOK NOW !!!!!!!!

I say this because the story within this book's covers doesn't fully release the reader until they have hit the last page and every emotion one could ever think to be experience has been touched upon. Yet, when I read this book, it begged me as a reader to do so in small increments because I felt as if I was making the same painful journey into slavery that Aminata Diallo is thrust into at the mere age of eleven years old. Out of frustration and anger, I turned to Where'd You Go Bernadette to cleanse my pallet before I could continue in between each section of the novel (the novel is divided into four parts as Aminata journeys from coast to coast and grows older). The book is by no means a simple or quick read. Rushing through this book would be a HUGE mistake for any reader. I beseech everyone who reads this review to READ this book AND to spread the word , Hill's novel deserves to be the next phenomenon. ...more My expectations were set really high for this one.

Now, I'm not one of those dinks who look to read popular novels (see Da Vinci Code pinheads) just so they can turn their haughty noses up on them and knock down averages), but I'm afraid my rating will knock this average down just a notch. Not because I'm a pinhead, but because The Book of Negroes lacks what I need in a novel. Time and again, when I read these types of novels, I can't help but hold them up to the bars that were raised by Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance, or Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. Particularly A Fine Balance . That novel tore my heart apart. Mistry had developed those characters so well, that with every turmoil or setback they came up against, I hurt with them, I rooted for them,I damn near cried for them. The slave trade is one of the truly dark stains on our history. All of those wasted lives, and families torn apart forever. How could this story of a girl sold into slavery and sent halfway around the world be anything but tragic? While I felt for everything she had gone through, and felt for her losses, the betrayals, I didn't feel a whole lot for her . The Book of Negroes reads like an autobiography, but this is a novel. I need novels to be rich in character development to engage me enough to care not only what is going on with them, but to care about them as if I know them. There are rare exceptions to my rule (Brian Lumley's Necroscope series for one, and hey, if you're the type of person who will read everything from Book of Negroes to Necroscope, well, you are a kindred spirit to yours truly. Anyways...), but, by and large, strong characters are IT for me, and I found Hill to be somewhat lacking in this skill. There are some authors out there (Stephen King is one, John Irving is another) who can paint a vivid picture of a character with the subtlest of details or quirks in the space of one paragraph, that will stick with you through the entire story. I found through this story, Aminata relays these terrible things that are happening to her, and I felt like nothing more than a bystander, albeit feeling sadness that these types of things really happened, much in the way I felt it when I learned about this in history class. I also found his prose to be just a little too simple. Anyways, I'm rambling here and more or less repeating myself. Bottom line: I liked the story. I had hit a point with about 100 pages to go where I was anxious to move on to something else, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. Hill did touch me emotionally with the last few pages, so don't think that I didn't feel anything at all for Aminata. I just didn't feel it a whole lot through most of the story. There I go repeating myself again. Okay. Good story. Thinly developed characters. Recommended for those interested in this point in history. And there were parts to the story where the plight of her people really hit me. Oh yeah, and I loved reading about what New York City was like in the late 1700s. Follow Broadway to the woods. That's rich. ...more Update (2) : This just in from BOOK NEWS - \"Lawrence Hill's bestselling novel The Book of Negroes is set to be adapted for film thanks to a chance meeting in a Toronto bookstore.\" http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/a...

I read this book as soon as it hit the shelves, but was not writing reviews, to speak of, at that time.

In the end I read the entire huge tome (it's about 500 pages) in just two or three days. I actually could not stop reading it. I learnt a lot from this book. I learned a lot about my own family history. I am half Sierra Leonean and the Sierra Leonean half of my family hails from Freetown. I know that they arrived in Freetown after becoming Maroons in Jamaica and then being expelled from Jamaica and sent to Nova Scotia. Apparently they were actually born in Africa, then enslaved and then they returned to Africa - via Sierra Leone - all in the space of one lifetime. So my ancestors' journey may well have had much in common with that of Aminatta Diallo, the protag in The Book of Negroes. One of the other things I learned from The Book of Negroes is that I'm a sucker for the epic, melodramatic saga-type novel! I fell deeply in love with this book and although it has faults, I was so smitten that the faults didn't matter to me. To thoroughly enjoy this novel you need to be able to suspend disbelief. Our heroine possesses extraordinary, almost supernatural luck and charm. Despite being enslaved, she manages to avoid ever being whipped or otherwise physically punished despite the fact that she is incredibly outspoken. Every time an evil slave-owner feels inclined to rape her or beat her or otherwise humiliate her, she always manages to escape just in the nick of time. She is raped on one occasion, by a disgusting slave-owner, but she miraculously bounces back and seems unscathed by the rape. I got the sense that the writer, Lawrence Hill, adored his protagonist so much that he just couldn't bear to let the very worst elements of slavery befall her. That said, he does 'go there' sometimes. The description of Aminatta's passage from her idyllic village in Mali to the slave ship and beyond is so visceral and disturbing that I had to keep closing the book and taking a break to pull myself together. I felt I was there and it was emotionally draining but insightful. Never before has a work of fiction made slavery feel quite so vivid and relatable. When I closed the book I had a renewed respect for the bravery of my ancestors who had made this same journey as captives from Africa to America (and, in their case, back to Africa again). Aminatta describes the African captives who survived the Middle Passage (or strived to survive it) as heroes and I completely agree with her. ...more My family is anti conditions-of-blacks-in-the-American-south type of literature.

With that said, the only reason I read this book is because the author is from Canada. Shallow, but true. The story is told in retrospect through the eyes of the main character, Aminata. Her character is complex. She is a strong woman, yet she worries about her appearance and acceptance, at times she questions herself, she feels tenderness for her loved ones, she feels fear and sadness. To her benefit (and at times to her detriment), she is assertive throughout her journey. Despite loss, violation, and overt and covert attempts to \"put her in her place\" she remains dignified. I loved the way all of the characters were portrayed. White doesn't necessarily mean bad/enemy. Black doesn't necessarily mean good/friend. And then there are the people in between (Jewish, Mulatto) trying to find a balance between being an insider and outsider. The novel covers about a 50ish year period. It explains some of the historical connections between the roles of Africa, USA, Canada, Europe, (with a touch of the West Indies) in the slave trade. But it also addresses some issues that persist to this day (defining cultural and religious identity, relations between minority groups). Because the book was so expansive, there are points in the story towards the end that seem rushed in terms of character/plot development. However, this works on some level because the circumstances in the plot suggest that Aminata herself may have been rushed towards the end of writing her story....but I could also be making excuses for the author because I like the book. This is actually the first book I have read about the slave trade, but it will definitely not be my last. ...more This book was obviously sad and depressing given the topic, but it was also fascinating. There was so much history I was unfamiliar with, especially about slavery in Nova Scotia and and the return of ex-slaves to Sierra Leone. At times, the main character seemed a bit improbable and the ending was particularly improbable, but she was a great vehicle for seeing and understanding slavery in a number of contexts and also understanding that \"undoing\" the damage done is very complicated. I found it absorbing; I found it readable. I wanted to like it more than I actually did. If any of Horatio Alger's characters had been born African and sold into slavery, Aminita Diallo might be its preincarnation. It's hard to say that any slave is fortunate, yet Aminita, compared to those around her, keeps drawing to an inside straight only to be dealt the right card. Hollywood should love it.

The story \"feels good\" from beginning to end in spite of the sordid background; our hero manages to rise above it, to persevere against all odds, and drink from the Holy Grail in the final chapter. She becomes a mix of Indiana Jones, Roy Rogers and Gandalf, a fine role model for underprivileged 21st century youth. But even as I was drawn into the mythos of accomplishment and social triumph, I kept objecting that the slave trade was not a literary romance but a real time irony and tragedy. In much the same way Horatio Alger sold a dream to oppressed workers, Lawrence Hill uses Aminita to revises a horrific chapter of human history just enough to give hope to a generation so far removed from it, the truth might be met with disbelief. But does that end justify the fiction? ...more What an amazing book! The protagonist is spectacular - I don't think that I have ever identified so completely with a character in slavery.

Inscription: Used Books by SarahJ I like them dog-eared and lawnsoft, and savor the character of winestain and thumbsmudge, the tear-warp between pages, scrawl lolling down margins, x's, question and check marks scratched out as anchors. They kindle affinity with readers who've leafed through before, house a kinship of signatures, conjuring towns and streets in states I'll never visit. They preach the economy of timber and purses, while scribbled dates evoke evenings spent couch-lounging through past springs and winters. Though they come off the press crisp and unsullied, I like them used for the gust of tinder and sawdust, the waft of feathers adrift in a hayloft. I turn the yellow hem of the pages, a hue half neon, half tubercular, like the wallpaper of a motel nicotine-thick with confessions where with the fray, I find repose under covers well plumbed and sepulchral. I like the tone and images evoked by this poem, but think it should also include the water-rippled pages from steamy baths and rounded curves from clutching a girls bottom in her back pocket. ...more Using the historical \"Book of Negroes\" as a component, Lawrence Hill has created a sweeping picture of the African slave trade through the life of one woman, Aminatta Diallo.

We follow her from her days with her family in the village of Bayo in an unknown country of Africa, to her kidnapping, travel on a slave ship, and arrival in the new world. The details of that voyage leave very little to the imagination. There she follows the path of many others in being victimized, occasionally befriended, but also holding on to the essence of herself instilled by her parents. She she is a strong child who will become a strong woman. With her we will follow the history of the American colonies in the late 18th century, trying to decide who are the good people, who can be trusted among the tuobab, the white people. Ultimately we the readers are treated to an amazing amount of information through this novel (and if you want more just check the author's reading list at the end). He lists where The Book of Negroes is available to be viewed also. I was struck while reading this novel by the care with which Hill maintained the narrative voice throughout the book. While Meena did mature in age and experience and knowledge, the essential Aminatta \"Meena\" Diallo remained throughout, acting and reacting consistently with what had gone before. After writing my review, I find the rating must be 5. ...more I've wanted to read this book for a long time, so when it was chosen as a group read in my Historical Fiction group, I jumped at the chance to push it to the top of my list.

From there, her story veers off in unexpected directions, and I found myself fascinated and completely wrapped up in her life and all of it's hardships and losses. I loved Aminata. I loved her intelligence, her perseverance, her strength to keep going after every stumble and setback and heartbreak. I knew where she'd end up - that's where we start her story - but I didn't know how we'd get there. Throughout the story there's this sense of perilous doom that hangs overhead. It wouldn't be a tale about slavery and human cruelty if there wasn't. But at the same time, there's a distinct sense of hope and purpose that made me want to keep travelling with Aminata, to keep seeing what was around the next bend of the road. The writing was beautiful. A joy to read, really. I marked so many quotes on my nook while reading this one. I was drawn completely into Aminata's world, no matter where she was. I could see it, hear it, smell it, feel it. There were some inconsistencies regarding the dates, and toward the end, there were quite a few repetitive thoughts, but overall, I loved this story. Very glad that I read it. ...more I am sorry to report I was disappointed in this book. I was excited to read about the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia. But there wasn't enough about that; most of the book was devoted to Aminata's kidnapping, passage, and slave days.

There were just too many inconsistencies (why isn't she unfamiliar with cities and maps?) and anachronisms (did people in the 18th century really say, \"Nice try!\" to each other?). The device of a memoir proved unwieldy: it is hard to imagine that this very dignified woman, writing in the early 19th century, would have had a 21st century \"voice\" and included a graphic (and gratuitous) description of sex with her husband. These are just a few examples; it was rather distracting. I think the book would have been better if the author had used the third person. I'd still recommend the book, but I wish it had been better. I'd like to read more about the subject, but I wouldn't run to read more books by this author. ...more as best as i can judge, lawrence hill reproduces here the style and tone of the classic slave

Classic Slave Narratives collected by henry louis gates in one volume that includes olaudah equiano's, mary prince's, frederick douglass', and harriets jacobs' autobiographies). i have taught a couple of slave narratives (douglass and jacobs) and i must say it was a labor of love, because, well, because they sound dated. their authors describe their lives in vivid and horrific terms, yet our contemporary sensibility, latched as it is to the psychology of the individual, relying as it does on introspection, inner conflicts, and psychic shadows, remains somewhat cool at these depictions. and then there's the fact that we are habituated to descriptions of horror. and the fact that we understand the pain of others only when these others are our friends. hundreds of people blown away on the screen don't move us unless: a) we have gotten to know and like at least one of them or b) there are cute animals involved. for some reason, the powers that manipulate the responses of our heart strings have not yet gone to work on immunizing us against the pain of animals. but yeah, they have worked long and hard at immunizing us against the pain of the human \"other,\" so narratives of slavery, the jewish holocaust, and various other genocides leave us a lot colder than they should. hill cuts himself a pretty arduous task in writing a slave narrative using the classic conventions of the genre (if one can call it that) yet trying to make us feel what it is like. i think he succeeds. maybe he should have abandoned the genre conventions, written a different kind of story, made the characters more tridimensional and complex and nuanced, instead of sticking to black-and-white (pun totally meant) representations, the way the original writers did. there are some efforts, especially towards the end, to penetrate motivations, ambiguities, and the power that political pressures have on personal motivations, but at heart this is a story of white people being horrible to black people. if you have already read the classic slave narratives you'll appreciate this book better, because you'll see what hill is trying to do. if you are looking for a contemporary novel with all the hallmarks of the contemporary novel, this will let you down. well, except for the remarkable historical details, which, judging from the acknowledgments, have been researched with painstaking meticulousness. okay, i've finished with my caveats. now to what i like about this book: * aminata is a remarkably strong, vibrant, and sympathetic character. she's a leader and a role model and you will love her. the parts when she describes her present life give perspective to the parts where she recounts her story of slavery. put simply, sophisticated, multilingual, erudite, worldly, wily, skeptical, witty, and non-religious blacks are not part of the pop culture or even the high-culture canon of the western world (this is bound to change rather dramatically now that we are past january 20, 2009, a day that must have made lawrence hill deliriously happy). * the subtleties of the politics of the slave trade and of all large historical events that subsume individuals and force them to collaborate are depicted mercilessly and in a savvy and clear-eyed way. this is also something that comes to fruition particularly towards the end. * because he puts us inside the head of aminata better than douglass and jacobs (the only two ex-slaves whose narratives i've read) put us inside their own heads, hill makes us feel the pain of loss and dehumanization more strongly, to the point that, as someone else here on GR pointed out, we feel that this could happen to us. one of the reasons why white students tend to remain cool when they read douglass & co. is that it is abundantly clear to them that this is something that can only happen to \"others.\" i almost feel that, having to choose one slave narrative for a class, this would be the one to choose. * from the point of view of those interested in historical trauma, the african sections of the story are non-pareil. africa as it was when aminata was little is gone, never to return. it is the devastation, not only of one or many peoples, but of a whole continent, and it all takes place in the space of one generation. * also from the point of view of trauma and survival, it is exceedingly moving that aminata's inner strength comes to her till the very end from the memory of her parents, even though she lost them when she was only 9. * **MINOR SPOILER** the book analyzes very poignantly the dynamics of race and belonging. as an african-born, aminata is always considered different from her american-born fellow slaves, at least until she learns their language fluently. but it is not until she goes back to africa that her difference becomes a mark of her identity. in spite of her fluency with their language and, obviously, of her appearance, the villagers among whom she takes refuge are tempted to identify her as a white person instead of as an african: \"In South Carolina, I had been an African. In Nova Scotia, I had become known and a Loyalist, or a Negro, or both. And now, finally back in Africa, I was seen as a Nova Scotian, and in some respects thought of myself that way too\" (385). rather than the psychological complexities of the contemporary novel, this book adds to the traditional slave narrative a transnational, multicultural, race-studies dimension. and i didn't mention that it is written beautifully and wisely and grippingly, and that i admire it very much. ...more There isn't a lot to say about this book. It was an excellent summer read: well-paced, engrossing, well written. Not a one of us disliked the book. Reading it, to me, felt like story time in elementary school.

Your childhood naivete allows you to accept all characters and plot lines as truth. The problem with a great story like that is it doesn't make for a good book group discussion. No one questions the story teller about character development or relationships between the characters during story time. And especially considering this book was so well researched, it hardly left any room for debate of the characters motivations (with a few glaring exceptions). BIG SPOILERS AHOY! We all thought Aminata was an amiable narrator, but it was Fanta we wanted more from. What exactly caused her to kill her baby on the slave ship in that moment? Ennui? Disdain for humanity? The baby's birth into slavery? A rabid rage for her captors? cult mentality? How did the Witherspoons justify to themselves taking Aminata's daughter away in what seemed like a very premeditated move? I appreciate the added horror brought on Aminata by not knowing where or why or how she is. I'm just really curious to hear from them they're reasons. How does a couple convince themselves that taking a child from her mother is a good idea? What kind of terrible omen would it have been for a slave to escape the shackles of America and Canada only to be taken back to Africa and live next to the place you were shipped away? And still have to see other people being shipped off and not being able to do anything about it? And how did King Jimmy or the historical equivalent justify his deeds? True, different tribes are different tribes, but eventually he must have known the kinds of lives he was enlisting these people into. How could that not have worn on him, despite all the wealth he was generating? This book does a fantastic job of showing the reader Aminata's and the slave's side of things. Often throughout my reading of it, I was introduced to the smaller implications slavery must have created for all involved that I had never thought about before. It was mentioned that the breezy way history was taught in this book was enjoyable; the beginnings of Liberia and Freetown, the British deals with the slaves to have them join their side of the fight, the Canadian treatment of 'freed' slaves and the repercussions thereafter. Hmmm. I guess I found a lot to say about this book. ...more Someone Knows My Name is a very well written fictional account about the early days of slavery in America.

Lawrence Hill's Aminata Diallo is a strong, lucky, fierce woman and I really enjoyed reading her life story. The writing itself flows so easily that falling into the story and just getting lost in it was super easy. The story itself was in turns shocking, heartbreaking and uplifting. I am glad I sat down and fell into this book, it was worth every minute. I have no words. This was one of the best books I've ever read, very touching. Hearing your own name spoken in public isn't usually something significant. Yet, on a slave trading ship that transported up to a thousand Africans to North America, this act of public acknowledgement was momentous. Calling out their full names to each other was equal to \"affirming their humanity\".

Yet, on a slave trading ship that transported up to a thousand Africans to North America, this act of public acknowledgement was momentous. Calling out their full names to each other was equal to \"affirming their humanity\". In the early mornings from the bowels of the vessel the chanting voices represented not only an important ritual of recognition and respect, it was also a way of finding out who had made it through the night. The conditions on the slave ship were abysmal: the Africans were jammed together and shackled most of the time, lacking food and water and sanitation, leading to exhaustion, infections and starvation. Many lost their minds, many more died. When the captives arrived in North America they were traded and sold like cattle and their suffering continued. The brutality of the West African slave trade in which millions of Africans perished is well documented. However, when a knowledgeable and perceptive novelist transforms these records and the many personal accounts of cruelty and tragedy on the one hand and survival, perseverance and hope on the other into one inclusive narrative around one memorable character, the realities of the many merge into one rich and lively, heart wrenching and joyful history-based novel of exceptional beauty and power. First we meet Aminata Diallo, the heroine of The Book of Negroes, as a frail old woman, yet with a fiery spirit and resolve that she must have had all her life. Hill's novel lets her relate her story in her own voice, direct and uncomplicated, yet subtle and insightful. Written in the best African story-telling tradition, it addresses readers directly, absorbing us completely into characters, times and places of the struggle for survival and eventual freedom. Nurtured by loving parents in rural Mali, Aminata, unusual for the time, was educated in reading and the Qur'an by her father and learned the skill of \"catching babies\" from her midwife mother. Hill's familiarity with places and cultures of different peoples in West Africa gives the depiction of village life and tradition vivacity and veracity. At age eleven, during a raid on the village, the young girl is seized by African slavers and forced to join many others on the long, hard road into slavery. The memory of her parents, killed during the attack, gives her strength and guidance throughout her ordeal. Her beauty and intelligence combined with her midwifery skills, help her to stay alive during the dangerous passage to North America and for the next decades, sold as property to different more or less abuse owners. Aminata's portrayal of survival in the midst of so many who perish, of violence and misery, but also of friendships found and lost, as well as love and family, evokes a rainbow of emotions in the reader - from despair and sadness to delight and joy. Hill's talent placing himself into the mind of his heroine is admirable. Through her he has created a captivating panoramic life story with authentic characters. Not only is the heroine of the novel a wonderfully vibrant and endearing personality, she is surrounded by many, equally believable, individuals. Aminata's life voyage takes her through many dramatic turns of fate to freedom and back into Africa. During the American War for Independence, she finds herself on the British side and is sent, as a freed slave, to Nova Scotia with the promise for a better life. She enters her name in the historic \"Book of Negroes\", a British military ledger that recorded the names and details of some 3,000 black Loyalists being allowed to leave the American territory for Shelburne Harbour. Hope, however, turns into gloom and despair. The first race riots in North America break out in Shelburne. Birchtown, the black settlement, is ransacked and many inhabitants are killed. Betrayed by some, but supported by others, Aminata survives and finally fulfils her dream of returning \"home\" as one of the \"adventurers\" of the Sierra Leone resettlement program, sponsored by British abolitionists. She has come full circle but not quite in the way she had dreamt. Asked by abolitionist politicians in London to tell her story as a genuine African voice to promote their cause, Aminata takes on a final new role. Hill's novel brings many factual historical strands together, introducing a range of contemporary personalities accurately into the storyline. Together he transforms them into a stunning and wide reaching panorama of human suffering, endurance and victory. Rich in authentic detail yet fluid in its style and tone, He has brought memorable characters to life that illustrate the strengths of the human spirit.

I believed the things that happened to her. It\u2019s just that I began to have a hard time believing that she would come through all this unbowed. I learned so much from this book, realized how much there was that I didn\u2019t know about the various and horrible permutations of slavery. The writing was clear and serviceable, which is more than I can say for many popular books, but there were never any beautiful moments that made me want to go back and read a sentence over. As a book designed to appeal to a mass audience, I think this one is successful. More than successful. I should stop trying to make it something it isn\u2019t. ...more The Book of Negroes is a novel that should be sung, rather than read.
