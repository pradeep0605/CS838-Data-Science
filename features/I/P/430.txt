{"Comments": "<---A>Fannie Flagg</---A> is a brilliantly funny, authentic writer. If you ever read \"Fried Green Tomatoes At the Whistle Stop Cafe\" or saw the movie, you will surely like this one too. It is a highly entertaining account of the formative years of a very down to eart girl growing up in Coastal Mississippi in the 50's. Great characterization! The writing style is unique and is as though Daisy were simply have a conversation with you.<---F> Most enjoyable</---F>. Give it a try! This is one of my favorite books. It is so fun to read and fun to review. It is fun to see the adult world in this way through the eyes of an optimistic child. The story takes place during the 1950s in the South. The antics of Daisy Fay are heart-warming, crazy and at times side-splitting hilarious. I would recommend this book for everyone to enjoy. This is a coming of age tale of a young girl who dares to look at life with great optimism and sense of fun despite the fact that she is lives the unfortunate circumstance of a child with an alcoholic parent. Her father and mother's troubled marriage and her father's scheming and drinking do not dampen her zest for life,<---M> her creativity</---M>, or her spunk.

Her father and mother's troubled marriage and her father's scheming and drinking do not dampen her zest for life, her creativity, or her spunk. Her story is shared in a diary style, yet tells far more than a diary. Daisy Fay is a maturing female who likes to write and she treasures her papers, ultimately keeping them in a locked box. We are privileged to read her papers. This is a novel that is filled with humor, yet shares life's sadness. Sometimes it is hard to enjoy the chuckle offered in Daisy Fay's life experience because of the heartache ever present. One easily comes to love Daisy Fay, who takes her circumstances as a matter of course and does not let her reality get in the way of her adventure. It is refreshing to read a story where poverty and misfortune are recognized as part of human experience, but not one that fully defines a life. Fannie Flagg writes a novel that clearly indicates the damaging aspects of Daisy Fay's father's alcoholism, but also presents the miracle of his imagination and spirit. Daisy provides a strong female character whose perseverance creates possibilities for a future other than what is assumed to be destiny for children who grow up in her situation. She is a self assured and self sufficient young woman who comes from a line of women who have held their own, especially her grandmothers and her great aunt. Perhaps in a small way, her mother shows strength in finally leaving her father and making a life for herself. Daisy Fay's mother seemed to have wanted more from her life and then because of her reliance on a man to take care of her, never achieved what she desired. I quickly fell in love with Daisy Fay when reading this novel. By the time I finished the novel, I was also in love with Fannie Flagg, her writing, her wit, her humor and her perspective on life. Fannie Flagg recognizes we all have our troubles. Some are hidden away and some are right out in public for everyone to see, but in either case we need not be ashamed by our situation. We are all worthy people and we all do better to support one another than to look down on one another. Life is to celebrate and enjoy. ...more Quite seriously, this is the funniest book I have ever read and has become one of my favorites of all time. This is Flagg's first book, written in a diary format of an 11-year-old girl who grows up in Mississippi spanning until she is 16 years old. Either Flagg was related to some of the oddest people on the planet, or, more likely, she has a remarkable sense of comic description. There's little plot in the book, rather it's a series of anecdotes about growing up in the South in the 1950s.

Either Flagg was related to some of the oddest people on the planet, or, more likely, she has a remarkable sense of comic description. There's little plot in the book, rather it's a series of anecdotes about growing up in the South in the 1950s. The book needs no plot. It gets so impossibly funny that a traditional plotline would take away from the hilarity of her characters. I used to teach 4th grade and read it aloud (<---B>I edited out about 100 pages of PG-13 content</---B>) to my students, but though I had read it about a dozen times previously, found myself unable to read it aloud because I was laughing so hard. My poor students didn't know what to make of it. Deliciously, the book makes particular targets of the ridiculousness of race and class. As a teenager, the protagonist finds herself participating in the Miss Mississippi pageant in 1958, aligning herself with several women who are in it for the scholarships and are quite aware of the lack of congeniality of the organizers and the other participants. As previously mentioned, there is some PG-13 content, and the book isn't without sadness. Flagg's second book, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe got a lot more attention, but don't pass this one up. You won't regret it. ...more It\u2019s narrative voice is that of an eleven-year old girl from Jackson, Mississippi who is watching her parents struggle through a nasty break up and separation, her father addiction to alcohol, her mother\u2019s inevitable abandonment of the family, and the mistakes of a myriad of other adults who should be stabilizing influences in her young life.

She sees all with clarity, (perhaps only children are able to have because they are at the stage in their human development where they have no conception of compromise, failed expectations or the endless drive to pursue hopeless dreams) and is blindly optimistic that all will be right in her world given time. Daisy Frances Harper matures into a young woman who faces challenges around every corner. Her father\u2019s drunken behavior, the death of her mother after an \u201cunnatural separation\u201d for years from her child, the bitterness of her extended family, the racist pathologies surrounding her poor white community would all pulled her down if not for her sense of loyalty, humor, and eccentric pluckiness. This book was a bittersweet coming of age story of an exceptional Southern girl whose heart is as big as Alaska. ...more Fannie Flagg books -the one you read when you feel that you are at your lowest point, when you feel that the world cannot get any worse, when you feel so over burdened that you are ready to go to pieces...if you can stop for a moment and pick up book, read anything written by Fannie Flagg and I PROMISE you that you will feel better...you will laugh and you will cry...you will do both at the same time...she is by far one of the best fiction/humor writers since Damon Runyon walked into Mindy's and Fannie Flagg books -the one you read when you feel that you are at your lowest point, when you feel that the world cannot get any worse, when you feel so over burdened that you are ready to go to pieces...if you can stop for a moment and pick up book, read anything written by Fannie Flagg and I PROMISE you that you will feel better...you will laugh and you will cry...you will do both at the same time...she is by far one of the best fiction/humor writers since Damon Runyon walked into Mindy's and asked if they made more cheese cake than strudel.

The author weaves in issues such as race, abuse, and homosexuality applicable to the time period and location. The book is very funny, often poignant, and at times heart-breaking. But, I was rooting for Daisy the whole way and I enjoyed the journey. ...more We meet Daisy Fay Harper when she is eleven years old, and we follow her transformation from girl to woman through the pages of her diary.

What I like about this novel is that we get to see little Daisy Fay grow up. The story isn't just about one particular time in her life. It's written kind of like a journal, but with many more details than a regular diary. Through all her ups and downs, Daisy had people who loved her everywhere she went. And the few people that really couldn't stand her, like Roy Grimmett, Kay Bob Benson, and Claude Pistal, just couldn't understand how someone with so little could be so happy. But I understand. Daisy Fay Harper made up for what she didn't have materially with her kind heart, her faith in herself and the people she loved, and her larger than life personality. She's one of my favorite characters I've come accross in literature. ...more I've read almost all of Flagg's other books and saw this one on a list of best Southern books, so I had to give it a shot. If you've had kids, especially girls, in the past 10 years, you might have read some Junie B. Jones books. They are all relatively short books written in diary format told from the point of view of an elementary school-aged girl who gets herself into predicaments. Daisy Fay could well have been Junie B. with a few more years on her. While I really enjoyed reading Junie B.

Where Junie B. would have one or two funny lines per paragraph, Flagg tried to make darn near every line funny, and I felt that was a bit too much. I enjoyed the story of Daisy Fay's life and was disappointed with where it ended, and actually, how it ended. The message to me was that the people you know, your friends, can help you along the way. ...more Hilarious!

I had never heard of it until I happened to see it on a shelf in our library used book store. It is unusual for me to laugh or cry when reading a book, but this book was so funny that I laughed out loud several times while reading it. Since I usually don't have time to read until I go to bed at night, I was afraid I would laugh so loud I would wake up my husband. We meet Daisy Fay, the protagonist and narrator, when she is 11 years old. She tells her story through her diary entries. One of the funniest lines from the book is about a Southern con man preacher who makes his living through schemes to get people to send him money. One of the scams he tried was selling autographed pictures of The Last Supper, which I thought was hilarious. She says that the preacher should have known better than to try to forge Jesus' signature. Flagg's next book was \"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9, published six years later in 1987. It was made into a movie and is the book for which Flagg is best known as an author. I'm surprised that this book was not made into a movie. There were many scenes that would have been great on film. I wondered if some of the book was autobiographical. Daisy's father is an alcoholic and a con man. When we first meet him he is working at a projectionist in a movie theater and later on owns some small businesses. Flagg's father was a small-business owner and a projectionist. She may have chosen those occupations for Daisy Fay's father because that is what she knew. If you aren't too judgmental and need a laugh, this book is really fun. ...more What a quirky tale! I must say, I wasn\u2019t quite sure of what to make of Daisy May and the Miracle Man.

It was an interesting story because if it wasn\u2019t for the humorous tack taken by Fannie Flagg, it could easily have been a very tragic story. She is a clever writer, and I don\u2019t think anyone else could have done this story as well. My head is still struggling to put Daisy May and the Miracle Man into a category- and I am still trying to figure out who was Miracle Man! ...more I have never read a book as brilliantly funny as Daisy Faye. Whenever someone I love needs some cheering up I buy them this book and can't wait for them to read it so I can laugh with them about it. Her disarming sixth grader stream of consciousness prose was so refreshingly different from anything I have ever read. I tried to read a few of her other books and unfortunately did not find them of the same caliber\u2026 but she really hit the nail on the head with this one.

I tried to read a few of her other books and unfortunately did not find them of the same caliber\u2026 but she really hit the nail on the head with this one. Daisy Fay is irreverently, accidentally funny in her description of her \"white trash\" life in her formative years. Her summers at the beach in her family malt shop, her Jr. debutante meetings and her fathers' get rich quick schemes genuinely made me laugh out loud. It's so fun and refreshing to laugh like this alongside a funny sixth grader when most comedies (and jokes for that matter) today are crude, overly sexual and lacking in imagination. Adore this book! ...more This was funny. It got me to remember a lot of experiences I had growing up. There were parts I just laughed out loud. Others I found some language in it politically incorrect. But while reading the book you need to remember the time frame for the story is when this type of language and description of things are really different than today.

How children might rationalize bad situations. It shows resiliency in tough situations coupled with some creative thinking. It will give you some laughs. ...more Haaaaaated it! I don't understand the inspiration behind this book (or, shall I say, the lack thereof?) For starters, what would possess a person to write a book about \"white trash\" in the first place? Secondly, why do her critics call it \"side-splittingly funny\" and \"sheer, unbeatable entertainment\"? I didn't miss the attempted humor...I just found this book to be morally degrading and not all that funny.

I'm hoping this was her only exception. ...more I think this was my favorite Fannie Flagg book, even though it is quite different than the others.

I cannot, to this day, look at a screen door or a chicken without bursting into laughter. ...more This book tickled my funny bone from beginning to end. It was full of the outrageous observations of an 11 year old girl by the name of Daisy Fay Harper. The author captured the literal mindedness of a little kid, no question about it. The setting is Shell Beach, Mississippi in the early 1950's. Residents in the small town are expertly fleshed out for us, thanks to Daisy Fay. No one escapes her hilarious notions. This one will make you smile. If you are looking for a book the makes you laugh out loud, this is it. Daisy Fay is 11 years old at the start of the book and has just graduated high school by the end. The book is written somewhat like a diary, with Daisy telling the story as she sees it. Not surprisingly, some of her interpretations are not exactly correct, and these misconceptions lend to a lot of fun on the part of the reader. There are more serious parts to the story, but they make the funny parts even more so. I've loved all the books I've read by Fannie Flagg, except this one. It was okay but I didn't love it. About 2/3 of the way through, I was just wishing it was done already. Perhaps the Southern life is so far removed from mine ( the whole coming out/ beauty contest/bitchy rich girl scene) I just couldn't relate to this story. I did have some laughs however, and was of course rooting for Daisy Fay's success, but all in all, I wouldn't recommend this book. This book was an entertaining read. It covers the whole gamut: alcoholism, disfunctional families, racisim, murder, homosexuality, you name it. Having said that, the book sounds rather lurid. It's not. It's written from the perspective of a child and done in a humorous and non-judgemental way. A good, quick read.", "Title": "Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man"},
