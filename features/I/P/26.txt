Yet, I found more than a job. I found feelings. I fell in love with a nice girl. I met her on the threshold of a Mexican restaurant. She was unforgettable in her beautiful Taco costume. We dated several times. We liked each other. We were made for each other. And yet in a couple of weeks she broke my fried heart. She left me for a Camcorder dressed man. His name was Olympus. He used to work on the other side of the road, advertising for a shopping mall. He was closer to her place than me. The Taco girl -that lousy bitch- told me how she needed to focus more on her life, looking at it from different perspectives. \"You know, Olympus is the right person for helping me in that process\". That's what she told me. I nodded in that reflective and well mannered way a sad french fry is supposed to do. I quit the job. Afterwards nothing had changed. And that's why I keep on reading the Diaries. I still dream of elves. I need to sit on Santa's lap asking for a woman.

You can see the satirical voice Sedaris is aiming for, but for me it just wasn't quite clever enough, or witty enough, to pull of the rather mean things he says.

You can see the satirical voice Sedaris is aiming for, but for me it just wasn't quite clever enough, or witty enough, to pull of the rather mean things he says. The first story about being an elf is Macy's was perhaps the best, most sardonic and darkly humorous. It did have me laughing aloud a few times on the train. There were still a few sections though that made me pull back and question some of the things he was saying (I couldn't work out the bit about the children visiting with learning difficulties - were we supposed to laugh at them (I hope not) and then comparing the shoppers to them - it felt very awkward). At its worst, with stories like Dinah, the Christmas Whore, they are long-winding shaggy dog stories with little pay-off and strange over-indulgent meanderings. The final story 'Christmas is for Giving' was the other high(ish) point in the collection, taking rich middle-class American 'keeping up with the Joneses' to its logical and surrealist extreme. The idea there is funny (a set of neighbours try to out-do each other with their charitable givings) but as with the subjects of his other stories the targets of his jesting are rather obvious and do not probe further than the stereotype. The type of stories where everyone is an idiot except for the writer can be a hard pill to swallow after a while. It's not entirely put me off Sedaris so I'd like to read another of his story collections to see if this tone is a one-off or whether it was just that my love of Christmas blind me to its darkly comic ways. Bah-humbug. ...more Interesting, two books in one week. Who THOUGHT SO! Now, I only read this because exams week is coming! Prepare for exams by reading irrelevant books. Yes, This is how I do it.

Sedaris really should stick with non-fiction, which he writes with flair, humor and poignancy, whereas his fiction sections tend to be so over-the-top and garish that they resemble sketches from a TV series. An especially tiresome chapter is \"Season\u2019s Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\", written in the style of one of those ghastly round robin newsletters received at Christmas. The novelty wears off quickly. By contrast, \"<+++>SantaLand Diaries</+++>\" and \"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\", which tell of Sedaris\u2019 actual experiences and observations, are funny and truthful. But 67 pages out of 138 isn\u2019t an especially high success rate even in such a slim volume. I\u2019d recommend You Better Not Cry: Stories for Christmas by Augusten Burroughs for a better selection of seasonal related laughter ...more Most hilarious Christmas tales around. You will never look at Christmas the same after exploring Sedaris's amazingly funny but somewhat dark world. I am amazed at Sedaris's guts to write down a lot of things that most of us would rather to keep to ourselves and that makes me realize what a hypocrite I am. You all must simply have this! Meh! Not really exciting, or funny for that matter. I liked the first two stories, and had a great time reading them. They were actually funny. The of them, not so much. I'm guessing David Sedaris's humour has some moments that are just not for me. Sedaris is one of the great comic essayists, and his blend of fiction and nonfiction (sometimes impossible to completely separate) has made \"Santaland Diaries\" both a truly memorable piece and a great one-man show. Strongly recommended for a dose of Christmas commercial absurdism. I've tried to read this short story before, when I wasn't familiar with David Sedaris. I couldn't picture him in my head, I couldn't hear his voice, I didn't know what to make of him so I left it. Now, after reading some of his other books and listening to him being incredibly funny, warm and self-deprecating (and singing jingles in the style of Billie Holliday) - it was time to revisit this. Or, read it because it popped up on my Kindle and I'd forgotten I had it. Written in 1997, this is the sho I've tried to read this short story before, when I wasn't familiar with David Sedaris.

Now, after reading some of his other books and listening to him being incredibly funny, warm and self-deprecating (and singing jingles in the style of Billie Holliday) - it was time to revisit this. Or, read it because it popped up on my Kindle and I'd forgotten I had it. Written in 1997, this is the short story of David's experience as a 33 year old Macy's Christmas Elf. He tells stories about the people who come and see Santa, and treats us to some anecdotes about the stranger people in our society. There's a parent who makes his child urinate in the fake snow. There's the mother who dresses her adult daughter up as a child and sits her on Santa's lap. There's the Santa who really, really thinks he's Santa. There are the people who ask for \"a Santa of colour\". There are the people who bring the kids who are coached. The people who bring the kids who are terrified. The people who want photos, don't want photos, the special children, the bold children, the spoiled children - but the ones that struck a chord with me were the ones who cracked jokes thinking they were completely unique, like the adults who would laughingly ask Santa for a BMW, a new husband, or a wife with bigger boobs. The ones who crack a smart joke and think they're the first person to ever come up with it. \"All of us take pride and pleasure in the fact that we are unique, but I'm afraid that when all is said and done, the police are right: it all comes down to fingerprints.\" Let's face it, we've all been there. I wish this book had been longer! ...more Very much front loaded so the first piece was very good and then went down hill for the others. A lot of his output is pretty mean spirited and aimed at slightly undeserving targets (Cristmas Nativity plays by 10 years old aren't that good? Really, tell me more). Although some of the framing devices are good, I felt if you took them away there wasn't that much left, and in particular nothing insightful. So, boo hiss for me.

Having been to the Macys Santaland in NYC several Christmases with my young sons only adds to the experience, as does having worked for Macys. Forget reading blah stuff like The Night before Christmas as your holiday classic! The first time I read this I was literally doubled over on the floor giggling helplessly with tears running down my face. Before reading this book, I thought it was going to be something about a man dressed up as Santa describing his journey but not at all. In my opinion, it's a good book, well written and easy to understand, but I couldn't understand where it was going to lead me. The fact that the book is divided into 6 stories make it hard to understand everthing and to get attached to the characters. Some moments were funny because the author had his sense of humor but sometimes, I didn't get it. This is actually pretty hilarious. To think what happens at Macy*s during the holidays. One word of caution: do not listen to this as an audiobook. I'm serious. Although it's nice in theory to hear an author read his own words, Sedaris's voice sounds the way crickets smell. If you hear it, you will know exactly what I mean. Just read it instead. This audio book is probably the only Christmas tradition I hold to besides Linda and I taking our fake Christmas photos with themes like \"Cats as baby Jesus Nativity scene\" \"Creepy Elves\" and \"Fiberglass Jesus and Beenie Babies\", I mention these because this audio book (and the book is best that way) is the PERFECT background to that sort of activity. Don't read it. Listen to the audiobook. The fictional chapters in this book shocked me quite a bit. I enjoyed Sedaris' chapters based on his real life a lot more. They always make me laugh. Funny, nice, true, short stories. Definitely worth reading it. irreverently hilarious Not my favorite Sedaris book, but still wonderfully funny! If you want a quick, bawdy, laugh out loud funny book, this is it! Hilarious. **************SPOILERS******************* I was excited to read this for a couple of reasons. 1.

Flash-forward to my face twenty minutes later after I got past the first short and things began to go swiftly downhill. Luckily my friend from work who recommended the book had already left. I read about 70 pages before giving up completely. Even while reading someone else from work said they loved the book. I've been working retail for the whole of my adult life and not even I can muster the level of hatred or smugness this spoiled guy has for the masses. I should've stopped reading at the baby in the dryer. For some reason I kept going and it somehow got worse. Anywho, the elf story aside, a lot of this was just extra dark and offensive in a way that wasn't really funny. ...more 3-stars for getting me into the Holiday mood. I am not really a Sedaris-fan.

Good for getting you in the mood for Christmas, or equally for the cynics out there, reminding you that there's a darker side to all the festivities.
