How the fatty meat combined with the fatty cheese and the white buns make a cholesterol parade in your blood stream that gives you endorphins that make you happy when you eat it. Something about that combination, seems to give our bodies a buzz. They were explaining that THAT'S why cheeseburgers and Mcdonald's in particular are so damn popular.

They're addictive foods because we get addicted to the buzz of eating them. When it comes to reading, I'm not much different. Combine action + sex + supernatural and you may just have a readership. I guess I'm not the only one because publishers have jumped on this ship like it's the only one with booze and half naked young men and women grinding up against each other (see I'm trying to use subtle images to get you addicted to my reviews. Is it working?) They must have been delighted when Frost walked in the door because her novel is pretty much the combination of sex, action and supernatural elements without ANYTHING else. Most of the dialogue is about sex, arse kicking or discussing supernatural elements.<---F> This book is a cheeseburger</---F>. A big, greasy, delicious, ketchup covered cheeseburger. The sex orginates from Spike/<---C>Bones</---C> and Cat, our main protagonist who is a half vampire. Some other characters come into this story but they're not important because they're not having sex. They team up together to fight vampires. They stab, decapitate, crush, kick, punch, tear, bite, shove and knife their way through every single encounter. Kapowi! (See this is the action part of my review. Settle yourself in bitches, because you're about to get addicted!) The vampires in this book can be good or bad and their eyes glow green when they're using their Vampire Powers of Awesomeness TM. They mesmerize their prey into obediance and take \"sips\" out of them. (There! Bam! You're now addicted! Don't try to fight it, just give in and ride the pleasure wave) So, I enjoyed it in the guilty pleasure way that you enjoy a cheeseburger while you're eating it. Afterward though I felt vaguely dirty and lost. Life was sadly lacking in sex, action and supernatural. I went and kicked my husband in the head but to my IMMENSE surprise he didn't immedately tackle me and make love to me with blazing green eyes. I must be doing something wrong. The last part of the novel dragged a little bit until a vampire started throwing cars around - because we can't possibly go thirty pages without someone bleeding out of one or more places on their bodies...and then having sex. While being a vampire. See, I TOTALLY understand why this book was recommended to me. It's EXACTLY the kind of sexy, kinky shit I'm into and I really enjoyed it (so thanks!) but then I also recognize that this is a cheeseburger. It was SUCH a cheeseburger that I started to feel cholesterol moving through my synapses and forming some brain version of diabetes. Give it a go. It was fun, flirty, dirty,<---M> and quick (Oh my goodness</---M>, it sounds like a just described a hooker!)If I hadn't kept thinking to myself, \"Damn you, Frost! Stop baiting me with supernatural smoochies!\" then I would have been able to enjoy it more for what it is. Junk Food Fiction. Just remember, Kids.

The absence of Buffy has really been playing on my psyche lately, so this was exactly what I needed . If you go in expecting something original, you WILL be sorely disappointed. Just because it's a derivative, doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable. Plus, I was in the mood for a snarky, mindless rom p, which is exactly what this is. I think mood will definitely have a huge effect on how you view this book. Gawd - every time Bones spoke, I would start having to fan myself. I felt like I was having hot flashes. Geez, why are my thighs all sweaty? If you've read any of my Fever reviews (notably Faefever or Dreamfever ), you probably know that I can go a bit overboard with the love for my favorite male characters. Bones is no exception. Bones is what you would get if you mixed together two of my favorite things: soot-covered half naked firefighters and rocky road ice cream. Burning hot, dirty deliciousness. DAMN! Wish I had a visual aid for that one. Hmmm, in fact I would gladly hand over a million dollar bill for such a picture!! He had me so sexually frustrated in the first half of the book that I was pulling out all my hair. I'm pretty much down to my LAST eyebrow now. And yes, I look exactly like that. Part of my problem was that I wanted it to keep going with that much intensity. But halfway through the book, they are already getting it on. Not that it wasn't good, but I would have liked a little more tease . I wanted the to be tortured with it. But I'm weird like that. So technically, Cat is not a virgin but in the beginning she acts like one. She's very virginal. And at first, she blushes every time he says anything to her. And she's 22 and getting ragged on for staying out all night once. I can't stand her mom or her grandparents. Get the EFF over yourselves! I can barely justify giving this book four stars, but I decided that three would be too few. That doesn't mean that I didn't love it. I feel like I just need to add that unlike the Fever series where I loved Mac and cared deeply about the things happening to her, I really didn't care at all about the plot of this book or really even that much about the main character. The only thing that kept me going was the relationship between the Bones and Cat, so I really hope that this changes in the sequels. So obviously, I did love Bones (no really?). But that's the main problem. He made this book for me. If you take him out, this book is two stars, maybe. The rest of the story and the main character were not all that captivating. Cat is NO Buffy, though she tries to be. Although , I did find this artwork. It's supposed to be Buffy and Spike but it makes me think of Cat and Bones: This is your typical vampire slayin' and vampire layin' book. Besides the green glowy eyes that the vampires have, there isn't alot here that you wont find in another vamp romance, except for Bones. He makes it sooo worth it. Regardless of it's flaws, it's definitely a SUPERnatural fun ride. And really hot to boot. Oh Bones. *sigh* Oh Bones, oh BONES!! *smacks the desk with both hands* Trust me. With Bones - you wouldn't have to fake it. ...more 5 Hallo Kitten Stars First read 2/20/2014 Reread 11/19/2015 *Spoilers* \"Is that a stake, Bones, or are you just happy with my new dress?\"-Cat \"Maybe he knew.

I just don't force myself where I'm not invited.\"-Bones Charlie whistled \"Amazing Grace\" as he drove. It was all I could do not to whip my head around and snap, Are you kidding me? Couldn't he pick something more appropriate, like \"Shout at the Devil\" or \"Don't Fear the Reaper\"? Some people had no sense of the proper music for a kidnapping.-Cat What this book is about Cat hunts vampires. She has since she was 16. That was the day her mom told her where she came from. That her father was a vampire that date raped her mother. Having grown up with all kinds of weird abilities, Cat never fit in. Then her mom told her all the time that she came from evil, that evil lived in her, and all vampires are evil murderers. Cat went out every weekend picking up vampires. Killing every vampire she picked up so that maybe then her mom would forgive her for the way she was born. One weekend she bit off more then she could chew when she went up to a blonde vampire Bones. When she leaves with him, things don't go as planned and before she knows it she has been knocked out and chained to a cave with said vampire asking her who she works for! When she tells him her story, that she is half vamp and what her father did, he offers her a deal. Help him hunt vampires, as bait, and not only does she get to kill vampires with back up, but he will help her find and kill her father. Cat jumped on that deal. As her and Bones hunt they uncover a vampire sex, and blood slave ring. Will Cat ever let go of her vampire prejudice, and see that there are good and bad in both vampires and humans, or will she let her prejudice cost many lives maybe her own? Can Cat and Bones stop the bad vampires from killing any more young women? \"I've been scared for you since I found out I was pregnant,\" she went on. The lights were off, but I didn't need them to see the tension in her face. \"From the day you were born, you looked just like your father. Then each day after that, I watched your abnormalities grow as you did. Soon you'll leave, and I won't be there to watch over you anymore. You'll have only yourself to make sure you don't become like the monster who sired you. You can't let that happen. Finish school, get your degree. Move out of town, make some friends, it'll be good for you. Just be careful. Don't ever forget you're not like everyone else. They don't have evil in them trying to break out like you do.\"-Cat's mom Justina My Bones: Bones is oh so yummy! He is so sexy my panties melted. Damn that vampire got me hot! The things that vamps says Mmmm Damn!! He showed Cat that it's not being a vampire that makes a person evil, it's their heart. He loved Cat, all of her just for who she was, not even her mom did that. He kicked so much ass and embodied everything a vampire is suppose to be. I can't sing enough praises for Bones. He was smart, sweet, sexy, badass, brave, and caring. Why Bones Why aren't you real???? God but I wanna jump his bones. (lol) \"I love that you did it to protect me, but next time, try aiming to wound, hmm? You know, maybe throw the knives at someone's head instead? Then they're incapacitated momentarily, but not reduced to a pile of rotting remains. Just food for thought.\"-Bones \"I can't stand to see you do this to yourself.\" I regarded him with wariness. \"Do what?\" \"Continue to punish yourself for your father's sins,\" he replied steadily. \"How long are you supposed to pay for them? How many vampires do you have to kill until you and your mum are squared? You're one of the bravest people I've ever met, yet you're scared to death of your own mum. Don't you realize? It's not me you're hiding in a closet-it's yourself.\"-Bones \"I know what you're thinking and you're wrong. This isn't goodbye, Kitten. I didn't survive over two hundred years to find you only to lose you within five months. I want you, but I'm not saying goodbye to you, because we will get through this.\"-Bones My Cat: I so have a girl crush on Cat. I loved her every bit as much as Bones. Her mom treated her like it was her fault she was born out of a rape, and that she was evil. Cat never knew true love. She hated herself, but she still cared deeply for others. She tried to do right. She wanted to help and save others so they wouldn't end up like her mom. I could understand why Cat felt the way she did and her actions. She felt very real to me. Even having the life she had she was still an awesome person. She was brave, strong willed, sassy, smart, and straight badass! \"I'm saying I'm a moody, insecure, narrow-minded, jealous, borderline-homicidal bitch, and I want you to promise me that you're okay with that, because it's who I am and you're what I need. I missed you every minute this week and I don't want to spend another day without you. If my mother disowns me for being with a vampire, then that's her decision, but I've made mine, and I won't apologize or back down from it.\"-Cat \"I want you to know that despite everything, I'm so glad I met you,\" I choked out. \"It was the luckiest day of my life. If I hadn't, I never would have known what it was like for someone to love me, all of me, even the parts I hated. I would have gone through life empty and guilt-ridden, but you showed me a whole new world, Bones. I'll never be able to thank you for all you've done for me, but I will love you every day until I die.\"-Cat \"You are going to wash your mouth out. If you kiss me, I don't want a face full of hepatitis.\"-Cat \"Lucifer's bouncing balls, Kitten, not again!\" Uh-oh. I squirmed, instinctively also trying to block Tony's body from his view. As if that made him any less dead. \"She was going to stab you,\" I said in my defense. \"Look in her hand!\" He was looking at the ground near my feet instead. \"Him, too?\" I nodded, sheepish. \"He jumped me.\" Bones just stared. \"You're not a woman,\" he said finally. \"You're the Grim Reaper with red hair!\"-Bones and Cat This book's pace was great. It doesn't matter how many times I read it, once I start I can't put it down. Cat and Bones together are explosively hot. The book really built up their relationship. They are one badass vampire hunting team! Their love feels real, and tangible. I couldn't help but fall in love with both of them. I fucking hate her mother. Justina treated her daughter like shit. Justina made Cat pay for her fathers sins over and over, never accepting her and loving her. <---A>Jeaniene Frost</---A> did a great job of building the paranormal world in this series. I had a great understand of the undead world and never felt lost. The plot was action packed. There was blood, guts, spit, and ass everywhere. Towards the end there is a awesome fight where Cat and Bones are just handing everyone their asses. This book had it all. It made me laugh, smile, swoon, jump up and down in excitement, and cry. There is no HEA in the end it is a to be continued. And the ending OMG ....... \"That's right, luv.\" Softly, but with unyielding resonance. \"If you run from me, I'll chase you. And I'll find you.\"-Bones \"I will never stop loving you. No one can change that. No matter what happens later, I'll still love you.\"-Cat ...more \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 5 'I think I've found my new favorite PNR/UF SERIES!!' STARS. CAT: \"You're not a woman.

Ever since she was a little girl her mother, a human who was once date-raped by a vampire and thus became pregnant with Catherine, has told her that all vampires are evil, demonic creatures that can't be trusted and that they all must be killed. So, for the past six years, Cat has used her superhuman strenght to hunt down vampires in her city and kill them without mercy. Then one night she runs into he vampire called Bones who's a ruthless killer and bounty hunter. Bones turns out more powerful than her and he ends up kidnapping her and proposing her with a deal: he suggest the two of them to team up and hunt down the most dangerous vampires together, that way they'll be even more powerful. It's an offer Cat cannot refuse and soon she finds herself part of a powerful and merciless duo of vampire hunters. \"There's only one way to fight, and that's dirty. Clean gentlemanly fighting will get you nowhere but dead, and fast. Take every cheap shot, every low blow, absolutely kick people when they're down, and maybe you'll be the one who walks away.\" What I loved: \u2765 The writing : it kept me enthralled and captivated from the very first page. There was a perfect balance between the seriousness and suspense of action scenes and the humor and romance between the two main characters. The dialogue between Cat and Bones was hilarious and had me laughing out loud more than once. \u2765 The characters : Cat and Bones are a dynamic, fun, sexy couple that complement each other perfectly. And Bones is pretty much my new favorite alpha male book boyfriend; he's smoking hot, a ruthless killer but he his tragic past and the patiente and care with which he treats Cat (aka his \"Kitten\") show that he also has a soft spot. And every time he calls her \"luv\" with his sexy Brittish accent, I melt a little inside. *sigh* Cat, on the other hand, is a badass heroine with a very tough, \"to the point\" attitude, which is very refreshing in a heroine. The only character that I'm not really a fan of is Cat's mother. But maybe she'll come around during the rest of the series...eventually. \u2765 The action, suspense, sexual tension, passion, humor, romance and tragedy ....all these elements turned out to be the perfect combination to keep me hooked from the very first page until the very last one. There were some very interesting twists towards the ending that I didn't see coming and that made me all the more curious to find out what's going to happen next in the fascinating, danger-filled lives of my new two favorite vampire hunters! \"You hold the ones you love close and fight the battles you can win and that, Kitten, is how it is.\" There's not really a cliffhanger, but still, I'm already looking forward to starting the next book in this series soon!! ...more This is one of THE ABSOLUTE BEST PNR/UF series out there!!

This place is crawling with them. It\u2019s like an all-you-can-eat buffet!\u201d Ugh. BUT. Bones is one of the most perfect love interests ever conceived. In fact, if he wasn't a vampire--not my favorite--he'd be a strong contender for Numero Uno Book Boyfriend (currently held by Clayton Danvers of Women of the Otherworld fame). He's a Bad Boy. A killer for hire with just a touch of vulgarity that makes him intriguing rather than crass. Or maybe it's that his rough edges are more acceptable b/c he's also daring without being reckless, loyal, and oh-so-patient with his temperamental Cat. Being a bit temperamental myself, I appreciate that. He's also dead (HA!) sexy. BUT. And I'm probably digging my own grave here (PUNS, I has 'em), but he's also very obviously modeled after Spike. As in James Marsters from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. You: What's wrong with that? Me: Well . . . You: *glowers menacingly* Me: HIS HEAD IS TOO BIG. It really is. And it widens oddly at his forehead. Almost like he's some Mad Scientist Super Villain. I want to like him, really, I do. And sometimes it's almost possible. But then there's this: SO. This reread I was on a mission. I was determined to find a suitable alternative for Bones-in-my-head. And I did. Behold, Justin Theroux: I was horribly disappointed to discover that he's only 5'9\". BUT that's the awesome thing about Bones-in-my-head--I can stretch him to the 6'2\" he's meant to be (preserving the aspect ratio, of course), and VOIL\u00c0. Perfection. *takes a bow* *congratulates self* Catherine Crawfield is one of a kind. She's grown up knowing she was different, but any attempts to discuss her extras with her mother are met with anger and shame. So she does her best to hide her strangeness. Pretends to be \"normal.\" Until, finally, on her sixteenth birthday, her mother tells her the truth: Catherine's father was a vampire who raped her. Five months later, Cat was born, premature but fully developed. To illustrate the point, Mommy Dearest stabbed her in the thigh to make her eyes glow. Just like her father's. The Monster. Catherine must be careful, you see. She has evil inside her and it wants out. Cat's mom . . . kind of a bitch. After that Cat makes it her mission to hunt and kill creatures like her father. Now she's twenty-two, and she's refined her technique, learned through trial and error the best ways to beguile then dispatch her prey. But one night, things don't go as planned . . . Her target isn't falling for her usual lines, and in the inevitable confrontation, he gets the drop on her and after being knocked unconscious, she wakes chained to a wall in a cave . . . Not good. That's when things get really interesting. Suffice it to say that they--Cat and Bones--form an unwilling alliance, and thus begins Cat's education about reality vs. what-she's-been-told. And this is where another of the Big Problems rears its ugly head: the slut shaming. Given what you already know about Mommy Dearest, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Cat's formative years included a rather narrow-minded \"Christian\" perspective on dating and relationships. So it's understandable that she has a hard time with her world being turned upside down, what with learning that vampires aren't any more evil than humans and that sex is part of a healthy adult relationship. BUT that doesn't make her self-flagellation any easier to read. The only thing I can say is that it's a realistic part of her character development, not a long-running theme. Those are my only real complaints: the corn and the shame. I acknowledge that the whole Spike thing is completely superficial and subject to individual preference. And despite those issues, HALFWAY TO THE GRAVE by Jeaniene Frost was still an entertaining read. The plot was interesting enough to hold my attention in the face of awful turns of phrase and sporadic bouts of self-loathing. It's pretty funny, too. And Bones more than makes up for any early deficiencies in Cat's character. Overall, far from a perfect first installment, but worth continuing. Recommended. ...more The greatest thing you can learn from love is to be loved in return.

Not sure about that, as I have never watched Buffy , but the story certainly reads like an indulgent fanfiction. It is a mix of non-stop snark/action/sex scenes (guess which ones I was constantly flipping to) with almost no character development or world-building to speak of. <+++>Halfway to the Grave</+++> is filled with cutesy gratuitous scenes of jealousy, sex on the stairs, and proclamations of love - the stuff that any fanfiction is full of. The characters are defined exclusively by snarky/sexy dialog with almost no back-stories - Cat, for instance, has no friends, hobbies, interests, etc.; and the story fails to create any kind of sense of place - there is barely any description of anything - clubs, apartments, cities. I understand the appeal of this series, I honestly do. I enjoyed almost-blushing-virgin Cat and dirty-mouth Bones conversations and flirting very much. But you can't sustain a book, let alone a series of books on just dirty talk, no matter how entertaining it is. As for literary quality, <+++>Halfway to the Grave</+++> has none.

I'm lying on the ground, my body is broken, my life force (soul, cosmic parasite, whatever you want to call it) has left my earthly vessel, but my conscious self is still functioning and I'm pondering how to react to this turn of events. What's most startling is that, up until about 3/4 of the way in, I had planned on giving this book three or four stars. The ending...that was the cliff. I guess I should explain. Oh yes, there will be spoilers. Now if you've read the synopsis, you know this is the story of Cat, a half human/half vampire outcast with an emotionally distant, prejudiced mother, no friends, and a hate hard-on for all vampires since her biological father was one...and raped her mom. OK, admittedly it started off on shaky ground, but the humor was good enough to force my hand into giving it a pass. Eventually Cat meets Bones, a bounty-hunting (hitman) vampire who nearly kills her, and the two of them team up to take down \"bad\" vamps. See, Cat is convinced all vampires are bad, but Bones helps show her the light. 'Cause he's all chivalrous and moral and shit. I dig Bones as a character (aside from his ludicrous, giggle-inducing nickname) because he's a vamp who isn't cartoonishly villainous, but neither is he the self-loathing emo type like Edward some other literary vampires. Basically, think of Spike in the 6th and 7th seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer . And Cat is what would happen if you took Buffy, Faith, and Sooki Stackhouse and smooshed 'em together. So we have our premise and we have our characters, and we're ready to move on. Good sexual tension? - check. Zany, vampire-killing adventures? - check. A crime syndicate with one or two \"big bads\" to take out? - check. Good banter between hero and heroine? - check. An awesome bloodbath at the end? - check A heroine who can take care of herself? - check. Sounds like this book has it all, right? Well, it does. Including a propensity for the heroine to occasionally act like a complete and total idiot! Why does this always happen to me? Why? Why can't I ever read about a female protagonist who is kick-ass and consistently smart? No, what always happens is that they're either chronically stupid the entire time or they show promise only to fall apart at the weirdest times. In the case of Cat, her great moment of Derp arrives towards the end. She'd acted dumb on occasion before then, but the one that really floored me was at the end. After taking out the big crime syndicate, Cat and Bones are separated and she ends up in the hospital, recovering. A couple of FBI guys show up (think MIB meets X-Files) and manipulate her into working for the government. They use her mom and Bones as leverage to get her to agree to this, and she understandably doesn't trust them and is pretty pissed off, but she feels she can do nothing but agree. Let's forget for a moment that I would never in a million years take that deal (seriously, if my mom were a prejudiced bitch like hers, I'd dump her ass somewhere and never look back), the important thing is that Cat thinks it's the only way to keep her mother and Bones safe, so she agrees. Never mind the fact that making those kinds of decisions for other people is supremely arrogant and self-centered.... I'm getting off-track. Anyway, the reader has had it drilled into his/her head from the beginning of this story that Cat doesn't trust easily. She doesn't even seem to trust her mother. Keep that in mind. When Bones first started training Cat, he let her in on all sorts of vampire secrets, including the fact that vampire blood heals. So at the end, Cat is still all hopped-up on Bones' blood, she knows these secrets, she's cavorting with bureau men she doesn't trust (both of whom are as prejudiced against vampires as her mother and want them all dead), and what does she do? She tells them that vampire blood heals. It was at that moment that I pinched the bridge of my nose and was like Hmmmm...I can't think of anything bad the bureau could possibly do with that information....can you? Now I think I have to keep reading because if there isn't a scene in any of the later books where Cat stumbles upon the FBI's secret vampire milking room, I might die of shock. ...more Great book.

Bad-ass half human/half vampire Cat Crawfield, armed with her acerbic wit, bitchy attitude, flaming red hair, slut gear, thigh-high leather boots, and silver knives, stakes, and bullets, slays vampires with a gusto that makes Buffy look like a girl scout. She\u2019s a kick-ass heroine who uses her barbed sense of humor and snarky personality with as much effect as her stakes and stilettos and knives and kitten heel boots! Cat\u2019s sarcasm and internal dialogue are hilarious, and the wickedly sexy, fun, spicy banter and romance between Cat and Bones is five-alarm fire hot! There are sooo many belly-laugh-out-loud moments in this book and funny quotes (just check here on GR for some examples). Now for the foremost reason why I loved this book...Bones, Bones, Bones, Bones, Bones...wistful sigh and dreamy shudder. Bones gives Edward a major run for the money for the top yummy vampire award! He just flat-out takes the stake...cake! Need some examples? Bones in leather on a bike, Bones calling Cat \u201cKitten\u201d and \u201cluv\u201d, Bones\u2019s sexy mix of Aussie/English phrases (\u201csod off wankers\u201d) and humor, Bones\u2019s surprisingly sweet, tender, romantic side and fierce love for his \u2018Kitten\u2019, and most of all the scene where Bones drinks from Cat had me fanning myself and nearly fainting! He can drink from my neck any time, day, where! For you PNR lovers, it\u2019s told strictly from Cat\u2019s POV and does have an urban fantasy feel and slant, but the romance between Cat and Bones is sexy, sweet, and flat-out combustible...very satisfying...except for a seriously frustrating, \u2018say it ain\u2019t so\u2019 cliffhanger ending that had me immediately starting on the next book (very glad I didn\u2019t have to wait for it) to carry on with the Cat and Bones saga!

I recently got caught up in this awesome anime show Naruto so I lost a lot of my reading mojo but thankfully, my friend Rachel recommended this book to me and thinking that all I needed was a break from contemporary I picked it up. Though the first quarter of the story was on the slow side, once the plot moved forward and the action and steamy scenes were showcased, I could not put this book down. The spunky dialogue, the kickass main characters, and the author\u2019s ability to captivate me with her engrossing storyline deserve two thumbs up. And I think it\u2019s amazing that as a reader who really doesn\u2019t care for typical paranormal creatures like vampires, the vampire hero in this book stole my heart \u2013 just one more reason why this book is so worth the read. One of the high points of this book was the two very dynamic main characters. The heroine Cat Crawfield is a half-vampire, half-human badass who\u2019s out to bury vampires in her vicinity as a way to atone for her mother\u2019s suffering and her own salvation. On one of these excursions she runs across Bones, an infamous, full-fledged vampire bounty hunter who\u2019s after some of the same vamps she\u2019s looking for. Though it started off rough, pretty soon the two of them form an unlikely team taking down vamps to gather intel. All while the action is going on, a slow-burn, tentative romance develops between the two. There was a slight disconnect at the beginning because I still felt like there was some insta-love but whatever, I looked past it\u2026if I had a hottie vampire like Bones declaring his undying love for me I\u2019d snatch him up in an instant LOL! There was also a push/pull part to the romance, as expected since Cat struggles with self-identity most of the book and reconciling her vampire counterpart to her human one. The only reason why I can\u2019t give it a higher rating is because the first 25% was slow. And even though I connected with the amazingly witty writing style in just the first few pages, I had to push myself a little to get through that first quarter. But the plot after that point was engaging and I had a hard time putting down the book. If you\u2019re in a book slump and just need something \u2018different\u2019 to read, I highly recommend this book as it\u2019s a story that\u2019ll keep you on your toes and a good first book in what seems to be a very promising paranormal/urban fantasy series. Halfway to the Grave is the first book in the Night Huntress series and not a standalone. Cat and Bones\u2019s story continues on in the next several books alongside a few spinoffs. ...more EDIT: I'm adding a honorary star to the first two books in this series, just because Frost has been consistently awesome throughout.

First of all , let me say that my rating for this book has nothing to do with the book itself and everything to do with what I expected it to be. I had made some silly assumptions before reading this (don't ask me where they came from, I have no idea (view spoiler) [might be early Alzheimer's though (hide spoiler) ] ), which pretty much ruined everything for me. To be honest I did enjoy the first part of this book. The problem is it all went downhill very fast after I hit the 40% mark . My name is Sarah and I'm an idiot . It's my own fault if I didn't like this book. Silly assumption #1: I thought that this was dark Urban Fantasy . Oh please don't look at me like that, it's bad enough as it is . Since I'm a reformed self-spoiling queen, I no longer read book blurbs. I read somewhere this was UF, saw the title for the series (night=dark right? Right.) and my brain short-circuited . My two grey cells went from PNR to dark UF in less time than it takes to blink. So here I was, rubbing my hands in anticipation, expecting wonderfully gritty times . If this isn't PNR with Chick Lit tendencies I don't know what it is. I almost went into sugar shock from all the luuuurrrrve oozing from these pages. Oh get off your high horses will you? I'm not saying it's a bad thing and I understand a vast majority loves it but I just can't stand all that romantic crap . There, I said it. I'm the alien from outer space who wants to scream every time Bones says \"I love you Kitten.\" Silly assumption #2: I expected Bones to be an aggravating Alpha male . Oh please don't even think about laughing okay? Most of my very good friends here go in heavy panting mode whenever he is mentioned (you know who you are people) so I logically assumed Bones was a total (hence irresistible) asshole . What I failed to take into consideration is that my dear friends are lovely girls who like lovely guys . Me? The bastards get me in heavy panting mode every time . Bones? A decaffeinated, diet alpha male. I thought he was cute at first but cute gets old really fast in my book . And I didn't think he was a particularly butt-kicking lead either. Or mysterious. Or edgy . Then he went overboard with the \"I love you Kitten\" machine gun and I just couldn't take it anymore. Ultimately I though he was just kind of\u2026 boring? Okay, go ahead, unleash your rage on me now. Then again, you should actually be thanking me for this . Maybe even consider throwing a party here. \"Why\" you ask? Consider this: that's one book boyfriend I won't be stealing away from you. WOW! Silly assumption #3: I thought Cat was supposed to be a totally awesome badass heroine . The cut, cut, cut, slice, slice, slice type. Or better said the slay, slay, slay type. I mean night + huntress + grave that surely means total badass right? Right . Silly little me also expected a complex character (she is half-vampire, half-human after all) with lots of depth . Cat? A badass? Please. So she kills vampires here and there. That doesn't make her a particularly fierce, butt-kicking character in my book. But that's not the worst of it. The problem with Cat is that she is so immature she makes me want to scream . Okay, I have to admit she's not as bad as dear Sookie . Because, frankly, no one can be as silly as Sookie. But I digress . Cat. The girl acts like a 15-year-old. With Bones, with her mom. With Bones because of her mom . With her mom because of Bones {insert scream here} I thought my eyeballs were going to pop out of their sockets from eye-rolling so much . And then Cat decided to pretend Timmie was her boyfriend. That just did me in. How old are you exactly? Twelve? So there you have it . I got to 74% and couldn't take it anymore. Mostly because of all the \u266b lovey-dovey \u266b feels but also because I was pretty much bored to death . I mean, let's be honest here, the plot is virtually non-existent . If you take out all the Bones/Cat relationship blah blah there is very little left . And what's left isn't particularly interesting . BUT. Let's end this on a more positive note. This book features pretty much everything I don't like: romance, nice male lead *shudders* and immature female lead. SO. If you like everything I don't like , there's a good chance you will LOVE this book. Besides, the mere fact that I disliked this book should give you an indication of how extremely enjoyable it is. YOU WILL LOVE IT I TELL YOU . Still unsure about this? Make sure you go and read these enthusiastic reviews: Shelly's , Danae's , Robin's , Jo's and Vicky's (if she ever gets over her laziness and finally writes it that is).

This book was awesome. It's got an amazingly sexy male lead, Bones, that is written how a writer should write a dang vampire. Dashing, hot, strong, intelligent, lots of banter and snark between him and Cat... the protagonist is not a Mary Jane, and she slugs drinks and fists with the best of them. Usually female protagonists in these books are a tad too straight-laced for my tastes. Cat is inexperienced when it comes to socializing and dealing with \"regular human situations,\" but she's smart and strong and a badass. It's not a complicated book and has a pretty basic get-the-bad-guys plot, but if you want a good, satisfying vampire book, this is one of the best I've read.

Unfortunately, Frost has done nothing to change my opinion of the genre. Writing a Paranormal Romance Characters 1) Alienated but speshul female lead who is insecure about her looks, inexperienced with dating, and trying to build identity away from her family. Preferably has under-developed magic or physical power 2) Sexxy, hawt (other modern adjective) arrogant male lead who dresses well. 3) Dull/clueless boy-next-door admirer (of the female lead) 4) Vampires (sparkling optional). Should include a hawt-but-naughty vampire and an Evil vampire 5) Clueless government representative (evilness optional) Plotting, romantic 1) Female lead needs to learn to trust rakish male lead while male lead needs to fall in LOVE with female 2) Traditional sex scene 3) Female needs to discover her sexual identity 4) Semi-scandalous sex scene (if you are thirteen) 5) Couple challenged by immortal vs. immortal issue Plotting, external conflict 1) Evil versus good World-building 1) Substitution of 'real world' for world-building Halfway to the Grave is best summarized with an equation: Blade meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer, minus Buffy's compassion, intelligence and self-esteem. Writing was about average for the genre. Family backstory took a vaguely interesting angle on the heroine's background. Heroine had normal to above average amounts of TSTL moments. I did enjoy one scene with a disagreeable ghost, and even laughed out loud at the end of it. I can't say that I recommend it any more than any other PNR books.

Those one liners from the hero will either have you laughing your head off (though I wonder if the Brit speak would be as funny for someone from the UK?) or melting in a little puddle of goo :) The series starts out with the heroine, Catherine, who\u2019s half vampire. She\u2019s made it her mission in life to kill all vampires as revenge for what they did to her mother. During one of her killing sprees she meets Bones, the oozer of sex hero. Bones is a vampire bounty hunter. They lock horns and end up having a \u201cjolly good\u201d time together as the story goes on. Bones reminds me of JD Robb\u2019s Rourke in a way. He\u2019s got the quiet mystery about him, he adores the heroine and is always there when needed. Yes he\u2019s one of those heroes who ends up getting the heroine out of more than one bind, but it\u2019s well done so that you don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s only got the role of damsel in distress. If you mess with her in any way whether you're weak or strong he\u2019ll kill you without batting an eye and he does it all with the most brilliant bit of funny/menacing lingo. Though there is romance, it\u2019s more PNR with romance than romance within a PNR framework. It reminds me a bit of Katie MacAlister\u2019s Aisling Grey Guardian series with a splash more romance. There could have been more development we\u2019ll say when they\u2019d \u201cget down to business\u201d instead of making it a quick paragraph or two and the focus could have been more on the h/h than the vampire hunting at times. This happens more at the end so I felt a bit short changed there which was why I couldn\u2019t give it a 5 star rating. Some of the action packed scenes at the end were also a bit too long I thought -got a little UF-y. It\u2019s also written in the first person which is not a favourite of mine but it didn\u2019t bother me here. You had enough of the hero\u2019s side to get a good feel for his character. I wasn\u2019t too keen on Cat\u2019s decision at the end \u2013very frustrating which of course goes to show that the author wrote a good book if they can get such a rise out of you (lol!) If you do decide to pick up this book, a word to the wise: get book 2 with it otherwise you\u2019ll be pulling out your hair what with the ending. It\u2019s pretty much a guarantee that you\u2019ll be itching to know what happened. One of the best endings I\u2019ve read in a good while. So it\u2019s quite a good start to the series. No excessive world building, original writing, laugh out loud scenes, a hellcat of a heroine and a jalapeno hot hero \u2013good thing books 2 to 4 have already been published ;) ...more Blimey!

They make an explosive pair and when they drop their guard you go from high impact action to awwwww that was beauteous in 3.0 seconds. What a rush! In this series, Catherine Crawfield is a vampire huntress on a mission. She\u2019s out there bringing down the baddie blood suckers in the hopes of taking down her evil father. Well, one night she goes for the wrong vamp. She captures Bones, who is a bounty hunter and after an explosive showdown, they form a pact that\u2019s both deadly, full of gore and ultimately a bond develops between these two that no one can break. I loved the dialog and shared scenes between the two protags. Bones is funny has HALE, he makes me BLUSH and his moments of sincerity brings down my defenses in a human heartbeat! Some of his lines cracked me up and others just made me sigh with lurves struck awe. I\u2019m big on nicknames and \u2026. Yeah\u2026 he uses them well. Aww!! Cat is the Red Reaper and no one can stop her. I love strong female characters that won\u2019t go down without a fight and Cat delivers every time.

There was a lot of awesome things about this book. First of all: Bones accent!! God, it was sexy! And okay, Kat was pretty awesome either. I liked how it wasn\u2019t a \u201csweet and light\u201d vampire story where they spark or have hopes of eternal loves. It was more raw, more real (oh the most real it can be inside the PNR genre) and overall a very good beginning of a series that I\u2019ll definitely follow. Rating: 4,5 stars. Storyline: Strong and addictive. Original inside its genre. Writing Style: Well written and very appealing. Character Development: Both characters are strong and extremely well developed. Their relationship feels very real just like their relationship with the supportive characters around them. I loved them both. Steam: Slightly hot. HEA: (view spoiler) [Cliffhanger.

I am loving this!!! Well,this was a fun ride. I don't normally read paranormal/UF books but I've heard so many amazing things about this series and I just had to give it a try. I don't like zombies or werewolves but I can manage with vampires, although I'm not a big fan of them either. Cat is a half vampire/half human and she's definitely one of the most interesting female characters I've had the fortune to read about this year. She's feisty and funny, but also caring and smart.

I enjoyed reading from her POV. Bones... yeah, whenever I hear the name Bones I instantly think of Temperance Brennan. Bones is a pretty awesome character - he's bad-ass,funny as hell,sarcastic and hot with a capital H. I seriously loved the banters between him and his Kitten: \u201cIs that a stake, Bones, or are you just happy with my new dress?\u201d \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s a stake. You could always feel around for something more, though. See what comes up.\u201d \u201cSo do you remember this place?\" \"Hard to forget.\" he snorted. \"This is where you tried to kill me. You were so nervous, you kept blushing. Never had someone try to stake me who blushed so much.\u201d But I also loved that Bones constantly pushed Cat to accept who she really is and to realize what she actually wants to do with her life. \u201cAll I'm saying is that sooner of later, you'll have to come to terms with yourself. You can't wish away the vampire in you, and you shouldn't keep atoning for it. You should figure out who you are and what you need, and then don't apologize for it. Not to me, to your mum, or to anyone.\u201d I loved the supporting characters too - Timmy and Charles were a great addition to the story. That ending left me craving for more,of course. I am definitely reading the sequel soon. ...more I started reading this book months ago, read the first two chapters and dropped it. Don\u2019t ask why. I don\u2019t even know myself. I picked it up again and am wondering what the hell was wrong with me back then!? Halfway to the Grave was a solid UF read. For me, UF is either a hit or miss with me. I either love it or hate it and I think with the Night Huntress series, I never really gave it a chance because I dropped it all those months ago.

I either love it or hate it and I think with the Night Huntress series, I never really gave it a chance because I dropped it all those months ago. But sitting my ass down and reading it actually paid off in the end and now I know why this series is such a hit! First off, I want to talk about BONES! I loved him! He ran the show for me. With the diamonds and cream complexion, those glowing green eyes and that British accent? What\u2019s not to love about the guy!? But what really got me was the fact that he knew exactly who he was as a person. He seemed so sure of himself the entire time, making Cat second-guess her beliefs that all vampires are bad. I expected the hero to be a tortured one who loathed himself and what he was. Sooo not the case here. Bones accepts that he\u2019s a vampire and that fact alone causes Cat to change her perspective of the bloodsuckers. It\u2019s refreshing. But Cat was the one reason why I put this book down the first time. Cat is a half-breed, a result of her mother being raped by a ruthless vampire. So she hates who she is, hates what happened to her mother, and runs around town killing those with no heartbeats. She is soo fucking bitter that her entire life is dedicated to ridding vampires from the world! I hate to say this but someone should have bitchslapped her and tell her to wake the fuck up and stop feeling so sorry for herself. I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t like Cat in the beginning. She was annoying and rash and never thought before she spoke. How could I relate to an immature girl who hunts vampires because she irrationally hates them? But halfway through, she realized her faults and THANK THE LORD FOR THAT! I nearly pulled my hair out! When she finally came to accept herself and stopped being so hypocritical, I began to respect her more. Also, Cat can be pretty badass when she wants to be! I have a feeling that she\u2019ll continue to be a kickass heroine that I\u2019ll grow to love more and more. I\u2019ll definitely be reading the rest of the series. With an ending like that, I can already feel my fingers itching towards One Foot in the Grave . Favourite Quote: \u201cRight, then, mate, terribly sorry for my unspeakable rudeness, and I do beg your pardon,\u201d he said with admirable humbleness when Timmie cracked it open. Only I could pick up the slight edge to his voice as he went on. \u201cI can only say that it was caused by my natural affront to the notion of her as my sister. Since I\u2019ll be shagging her tonight, you can imagine how I\u2019d be distressed at the thought of rogering my sibling.\u201d \u201cYou schmuck!\u201d I brust as Timmie\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll be shagging tonight is yourself.\u201d \u201cYou wanted sincerity,\u201d he countered. \u201cWell, luv, I was sincere.\u201d ***Rating edited*** After reading the rest of the series, I changed this rating from 4 starts to 3 stars. ...more I had fairly high expectations for Halfway to the Grave, since all my Goodreads friends seem to adore the series, and I'm happy to say the book lived up to the hype.

Although the overall tone of the story was very light Jeaniene Frost succeeded in squeezing in just enough dark happenings and serious emotional moments to keep me fully engaged with both the story and the characters. The story itself was a ton of fun. Cat is a vampire hunter who approaches the job in a far different fashion than that employed by Buffy. She dangles herself a bait for date munching vampires! When she stumbles across a ring of vampire human traffickers she is reluctantly forced to pair with vampire bounty hunter Bones. For the most part Cat and Bones were likeable characters who made a good couple. This was just the perfect sort of light and romantic UF that I was looking for. Rating: 4.5 stars Audio Note: Tavia Gilbert gave a great performance as always. She is great with humor and with conveying a sense of emotion with her voice. If I had to moan about something it would be the Cockney accent for Bones. The poor guy sounded like a reject from an Oliver Twist play rather than our hunky vamp lead! ...more \u2665\u2665\u2665 4.25 AWESOME STARS \u2665\u2665\u2665 \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf Come one, come all, bloodsuckers!

It was a bit annoying how she kept rejecting Bones, especially after all he did for her (I would be all over him in an instant).

Then the things started getting steamier between these two and I couldn't stop reading. I loved their interactions, despite how Cat acted sometimes. I even liked her klumsy neighboor, Timmie. He was kind of adorable. I enjoyed the storyline, and all of the fighting scenes. The ending made me freaking sad, though. There was a relationship cliffhanger, but the main storyline was resolved. It left me wanting SO much more. I can't wait to read the next book very soon! I think everyone should read this, so you can meet Bones too! It was a really great first book of the series. ...more Opening Line: \"I stiffened at the red and blue lights flashing behind me, because there was no way I could explain what was in the back of my truck.\" I'm a little late jumping on this bandwagon but anyways... Wow this was good mostly due in part to our delicious hero Bones. He is absolutely fantastic and oh so sexy. His character alone will have me reading the rest of this series, reminding me on one level of Edward from Twilight in his unwavering love and protectiveness of Cat but of course diffe Opening Line: \"I stiffened at the red and blue lights flashing behind me, because there was no way I could explain what was in the back of my truck.\" I'm a little late jumping on this bandwagon but anyways... Wow this was good mostly due in part to our delicious hero Bones. He is absolutely fantastic and oh so sexy. His character alone will have me reading the rest of this series, reminding me on one level of Edward from Twilight in his unwavering love and protectiveness of Cat but of course different in that Bones is ALL MAN. HTTG is a fast paced, action packed, somewhat bloody yet utterly amusing read. With a spunky impulsive heroine, delicious, bad boy hero and a unique modern storyline involving the Vampire hunter theme. Catherine Crawford (Cat) is just your average half Vampire college student who in her spare time trolls the local bar scene seeking out the undead and killing them. Her hope is that one day she will come across the vampire that raped her mother, -otherwise known as dad. One night while stalking her next target Cat gets more than she bargained for when she attempts to take down Bones, a two hundred year old, British speaking, Vampire, bounty hunter. Upon learning that she's half vampire Bones quickly turns the tables on the feisty and impetuous Cat, kidnapping her then forcing her into an unwilling partnership. Bones feels that together they'll be unstoppable since she's cunning and has the strength of a man. She's also pretty darn good with a dagger and deadly with a stake. And since other vampires can't sense her she'll also make the perfect bait. Cat in turn agrees to let him train her under the condition that he helps her find her dead beat dad. Throughout Cat's training she's determined that as soon as she can she's going to take Bones out too. After all her mother always told her; the only good vampire is a dead vampire. As Cat gets to know Bones however she soon realizes that not all Vampires are created equal. And when the bodies start piling up he may very well be the only one she can trust even though its becoming apparent that Bones has some secrets of his own. The sexual tension between Cat and Bones is awesome especially during their training sessions and I really appreciated the gradual build up within their relationship, slowly becoming friends as Cat lets down her prejudices. Bones is simply lovely, never wavering in his feelings towards her which at times proves difficult. He has been written as a bad boy so when he falls for Cat...*Sigh. The story races toward an exciting, blood splattered, cliff-hanger of an ending setting things up perfectly for One Foot in the Grave . My only regret with HALFWAY TO THE GRAVE would be that it has been written in the first person, I would really liked to have heard what Bones was thinking occasionally. I also wanted more love scenes, there were just too many fade to black moments. All this however just signifies to me a great book, when I want more.

Bones is gorgeous, has a bad boy edge to him, and is a no-bullshit kind of guy. Love him! Also, this remains my all-time favourite vampire series, so I'm adding a star to my rating. Knowing what comes next, I'm no longer that frustrated. And I think there's a violent person deep down inside of me. I like how Cat and Bones fight until she passes out, Reread: September 2016 Reread rating: 5 stars I shamelessly picture Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer every time I read about Bones.

That surely takes the stress out of a relationship. *************************************** Original read: August 2015 Original rating: 4 stars This book is delicious! I loved the scene with Bones, Cat, Spade and Francesca in the hotel room. I laughed like crazy and I was amazed a book could do this to me. I felt like I was watching a movie, so vivid was that part. And I laughed... then I laughed... and then I laughed some more. If there is ever a movie made after this book, I have to see this scene over and over again. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the story frustrated me towards the end. But then again... \"Life sucks and then you die\" . ...more", "Title": "Halfway to the Grave"},
