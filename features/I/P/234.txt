King is a great writer, he can craft a solid, fast-paced narrative and turn it into a great big tome without making it feel especially bloated. I like a thrilling adventure filled with horror and action, sure. but I really wanted to read more about those four friends and their lives together and apart. when one died it felt much too soon because I totally got him and yet there was still so much more to see. then when another died I felt genuinely sad - and not even because of the death itself, which made narrative sense - but because now there was a second story, a second life, that was all finished up in the book and that I still wanted to go on. King's humanism and his skill at giving you characters who the reader can implicitly, deeply understand almost works against him in Dreamcatcher, at least for me. I found myself wishing that this was a different book, one that wasn't a novel about an alien invasion but was instead all about these four friends, their histories and their futures, their annual hunting trips where they could be their true selves. I wanted all of that instead of aliens. still, good book. and the cover is awesome, meaningful even: ...more As I was going up the stair I meet a man who wasn't there; He wasn't there again today!

But then again, at some parts, it left me feeling miserable and asking myself if I was ever going to finish it, so because of that, the other part of me think that it deserves only 2 stars. So I guess I'll just have to settle and give it 3 (3.3) stars. But still, I don't think I've ever wished that Goodreads had a half-star system, as much as I do now. Dreamcatcher is a book about alien invasion, but it's unlike any other alien invasion book. Also, it is unlike any other Stephen King's book that I've read. The book started out great. I actually loved the first half. I loved getting to know our main characters, I loved the plot, and I loved how King introduced aliens. There were even some scenes that creeped me out, and at some parts I even had to stop reading for a few seconds. But then, somewhere in the middle, something happened, and the book unfortunately got worse. It started dragging on and at some parts it became flat out boring. Then, maybe 50 pages before the end, the pace picked up again, and it got back to being amazing. I absolutely loved the way it ended, and how everything came together. When it comes to characters, just like in any other King's work, they were my favorite part of this book (well, at least some of them were). I loved our main four characters (Henry and Jonesy especially). I also loved Duddits, and even Owen. But, on the other hand, there is Kurtz - a character I absolutely despised. And he is the main reason why I had problems with this book. I think that his character was completely unnecessary. I loved reading from everyone's point of view except from his. And the irony was that his chapters got bigger and bigger as the book went on. In my opinion, he brought nothing to the story, and was only there to make it longer. If his character was removed from the story I don't think that anything important in the plot would change. In the end, even though this book made me question my sanity a few times, I'm still glad that I've read it. Even though it had some bad parts, it also had so many more amazing parts. ...more Let me say at the outset: I am a HUGE Stephen King fan, and I've read all the novels and short stories, as well as his rather wonderful books on writing. Unfortunately, Dreamcatcher is a bloated, vacuous, dreadful piece of self-indulgence that mostly goes to show that King has apparently gotten so famous that no one dares edit him or tell him that he's written a bad book. The pointless repetition in this door-stop of a novel is staggering beyond belief (and, ultimately, stultifying as well).

The pointless repetition in this door-stop of a novel is staggering beyond belief (and, ultimately, stultifying as well). King beats you over the head with his 7th-grade brand of peepee/caca humor (I presume it's supposed to be funny, if you think scores of pages with people reacting to fetid flatulence is funny) until you're ready to join forces with Tipper Gore. He gives his main characters an annoying set of catch-phrases (meant to be all down-homey Maine) that they say over and over and over and over and over like verbal tics until they sound like mental defectives. He needlessly involutes the plot, requiring the reader to go back and forth in time-which must have seemed like a nifty device at some point in the writing, but which is ultimately just a nightmare (and not the good kind) of padding and disorganization. Since I also love (or have loved) the 'potboilers' of Grisham, Crichton, et al., I note an increasing trend among these writers (case in point: Tom Clancy's tumid *Sum of All Fears*): to write obese and flabby novels (high-cholesterol plot, no unneeded fiber such as character development) that all but completely ignore the reader and keep winking ingratiatingly at the screenwriter over your shoulder. Personally, I'm a little sick of it. Thankfully, you don't have to give up good writing in order to enjoy action-oriented, heavily plotted suspense fiction-consider the truly wonderful series of carefully constructed books by Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston or Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. Meanwhile, I'm giving this book one star because that's the lowest rating you can give; in reality, it shouldn't even show up on the scale. ...more Sigh... You ready? Let's get this over with.

Whatever King wrote during this time would have been utter crap, trust me. Pain dulls the creative process. This is why the most prolific creative persons are normally addicts of some kind. It's hard to access your imagination when parts of you are throbbing like a goddamn strobe light. Drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and even coffee, are wonderfully liberating. And who of us isn't hurting in some way? Should I cut King some slack because of all that? Well, I'll answer your one-part question with a two-part question. Just because you write something to completion, does that mean it should be published? Does completion alone demand that the world have access to it? Dreamcatcher should have been trunked. I know it. You know it. King knows it. There are 200 pages of fart jokes. 200 pages. I'm all for vulgar humor, but there's only so long one person can listen to an Andrew Dice Clay standup special. After so long, it ceases to be funny due to repetition. I get it! Farts are funny. Move on. I actually don't mind the shit weasels. They made sense to me. It's the easiest exit.

That part pisses me off, especially since Beaver is one of the only likable characters in the book. Which brings me to another reason this book fails so miserably. (hide spoiler) ] It worked because you fall in love with those kids and the adults they become. They're all likable. Flawed, yes, but likable. In Dreamcatcher , Pete is wholly forgettable, Jonesy and Henry are oddly one character split in two. If you happen to reread Dreamcatcher (I don't recommend it, but if you do...) pay attention to their reactions and thought processes. It's hard to keep track of on a first read through, but this time around it was glaringly obvious. And yeah, Beaver is cool, but sadly (view spoiler) [he's the first motherfucker to die (hide spoiler) ] This review is all over the place, but so is this book. There's no cogent thread. It bounces all over the place, from past to present, from head to head, with not a single fuck to give for cohesion. And I won't even discuss how much could have been edited out of this beached-whale of a book. I was sincerely hoping that, like so many other rereads during the challenge, I would find out that it was me, that my memories of how horrible this book is would be tossed away because I'd grown older and wiser. Nope. It's all still one huge fuckerow. Spoilers ahead. Not only spoilers for this book, but for all of King's work. It's on you if you click \"view spoiler\". Word. (view spoiler) [ Conspiracy Theory: While I severely dislike Dreamcatcher , it is unfortunately the glue that holds my It/The Tommyknockers/The Dark Tower theory together. If you're unfamiliar with my theory, here is the Reader's' Digest Condensed Books version. I believe that all of King's books come back to one, if not all three, of those books I mentioned above. All of them. From Carrie to the present. Every last one. In It , Pennywise introduces himself to Georgie as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, or Mr. Gray. In this one, PENNYWISE LIVES is scrawled along the wall of a sewer in Derry. I believe that the aliens in Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers , the Grays, are creatures from the Prim, and that Pennywise is of the same species. I believe the reason Pennywise was able to survive as long as he did is because he created his own environment down in the sewers, his own ecosystem, much like the Grays in The Tommyknockers . I also believe that the creature known as Pennywise was rocketed into our world when Gan rose up and the Prim receded. My theory is further strengthened by Douglas (I hate calling the kid Duddits) being able to see the line, or, if you will, the Beam. Now think about how Pennywise murders, how he bites and tears with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. Many mistakenly believe that Pennywise's final form at the end of It is the spider. Read the reviews. There are hundreds of people who complain about the final reveal being a spider, and how let down they were that's that all he was, was some telepathic spider from outer space. But Pennywise is only trapped in that form, a form he chose to elicit fear, much the same way he chose the clown. What if Pennywise is nothing but an overgrown shit weasel? Ah, now we're cooking with petrol! Think about the teeth. The real creature would need to have those teeth to feed. When Adrian is attacked under the bridge toward the beginning of It , it's said that the clown takes a huge bite out of him, and that the guy has all these small holes in him, as if he'd been worked over by some kind of shark. This sounds exactly like the wounds the shit weasels inflict. Game, set, match. (hide spoiler) ] In summation: Not the worst Stephen King book in existence, but Dreamcatcher is easily numero dos. #1 is From a Buick 8 , and guess what, sports fans, that shit's up next. Fuck me, Freddie, and bite my bender, indeed. Final Judgment: An 882-page ad for Beano ...more I have read this a few times now and I think that the older I get, the more I see and get out of this book. While it's definitely true that King is repeating some themes and tropes from his previous books, I think that the relationships and the connections depicted here are some of the most touching, at least in my mind. I love the way that King can bring forth such strong emotions in me. There were times when I literally had to set this book down because I couldn't see for crying - and those ar I have read this a few times now and I think that the older I get, the more I see and get out of this book. While it's definitely true that King is repeating some themes and tropes from his previous books, I think that the relationships and the connections depicted here are some of the most touching, at least in my mind. I love the way that King can bring forth such strong emotions in me. There were times when I literally had to set this book down because I couldn't see for crying - and those are some of the most mundane sections of the book. The introduction of Duddits both hurt and restored my faith in humanity. The cruelty in that scene, and the way that it was stood up against, both brought me to tears. In fact, just about every scene containing Duddits brought me to tears this time around. Because he's just so innocent and it hurts me to see him hurt - even if that hurting is just missing someone. I think that this has a lot to do with the changes in my own life, and how I see certain unfairnesses now, and want to protect against them. I'm just a big ol' softy these days. Anyway - I think my previous review of this book is likely to be much better than this one. I covered a lot of the ground that I would want to talk about already over there. But some things stuck out at me this time around - such as the concept of rape, what constitutes rape, and especially of how men deal with rape. It's interesting to me how public opinion of this has shifted in recent years. It used to be that the concept of male rape was inconceivable. Men couldn't be raped. End of story. But here, we have two different men use the term \"rape\" to describe the violation of their minds, and both times it's just kind of glossed over and the method of dealing with it is to ignore it and pretend that it didn't happen. Which is, of course, supremely unhealthy and terrible advice. The first time, it's mentioned out loud to another man, who tells him to \"let it go\" as though a violation of that kind is something that one should not even acknowledge had happened, as if it's an invalid feeling to have about such an event. The second time, it's the victim himself who internally feels that \"there were times when he thought he might be the only man on earth who truly understood what it was to be raped.\" And that \"some things were better forgotten.\" This one is both understandable and incredibly condescending at the same time to me. What he'd gone through is absolutely rape, even though there was no sex involved. His body and his mind had been violated in the most intimate and horrific way and he could not stop it from happening. The part that bothers me though is the assumption that he's the only one to understand what it feels like. Because, while I know that there were no other cases exactly like his - he was in fact NOT the only one to have been violated in that way, and he KNOWS he was not. He witnessed and was present for all of the other cases that happened in the book as well. But this assumption that he's the only one diminishes the violation of others. In a way, all telepathy is a violation, right? It's an invasion of our right to privacy. So technically, everyone who had their minds \"read\" in this book was violated - raped, if you will. Yet this one character feels like he's the only one. I can understand, because in the context of this book, he was \"special\" - but he was far from the only one, and I think, were he to see the broader implications of what happened, and what could have happened, not just in the life or death sense, he would have a better understanding and a bit more empathy for others, and it might help him deal with it better. But that's just me and my bleeding heart going off again. Anyway, that's one nitpick I have about this book. Another is that it does drag a bit in the back half, and the chase goes on for a bit too long before the final resolution. \u201cPrepare to engage enemy . . . bogey\u2019s airspeed not sufficient for intercept.

Anyone who wants to read this book must be prepared for sleepless nights and illusions. Stephen King is a fantastic writer who uses such descriptions it makes you feel that right behind you there is an alien waiting to take your energy. Throughout this book I tried figuring out what the title meant and how it relates to the book. By the end I love how the last few pages are devoted to explaining things and making eveything clear. I feel that Stephen King wrote this book to explain we're all in a dream, and it's got us in this hold that we can't let go of. There was a lot of different parts to this book, and being in the 10th grade you try to find how they all connect with one another and what everything symbolizes. By the end everything just comes together. At first I thought there was a lot of \"fluff\" and unnecessary details but I realize the book is the perfect amount of pages to tell the story that Stephen King wanted to convey. This is an intense book, with such twists and turns it will keep you reading. ...more Whew... There's a lot that I want to say about this book, and I'm not really sure where to start. I first read this book back in... oh, 2002 or 2003, maybe, and I can absolutely say that I did NOT get much out of it. Sure, it's still a thrill ride, still entertaining, but it was definitely not his best, in my, somewhat oblivious opinion. But see... I was something of a King Re-reader back then. I had my favorites - 'The Stand', 'The Shining', 'The Talisman', 'Needful Things' - to name a few, and Whew... There's a lot that I want to say about this book, and I'm not really sure where to start.

Sure, it's still a thrill ride, still entertaining, but it was definitely not his best, in my, somewhat oblivious opinion. But see... I was something of a King Re-reader back then. I had my favorites - 'The Stand', 'The Shining', 'The Talisman', 'Needful Things' - to name a few, and I read, and re-read, and re-read those favorites, so, I wasn't as well versed on my King Universe back then as I am now. Now, having read many more of King's \"inter-related\" books, I see the threads that bind them all together. Reading this again now was like... well, kind of like meeting a cool person at a bar, having a really interesting conversation with them, and then 7 years later finding out they are a long lost relative. That feeling of recognition is the same, although probably toned down a little since this is a book and NOT a long lost relative. Many, many times though, my eyes popped open and I'm like \"OH! That's a reference to...!\" or \"WOW! I see where he's going!\" etc. For instance, the number 19 crops up many times, as does the color red (or crimson, if you like that better), as does the theme of children bonding for life and for better or for worse, no matter where their adulthood may take them, King's own accident, etc. But in addition to the many references to King's other works and life (which I've barely even touched on), there are references here to many external things that I never recognized before. Things like twice calling Duddits a \"tribble\", which is a reference to Star Trek, or like the red growth that is very reminiscent of the mossy red flora from 'The War of the Worlds' by H.G. Wells (and speaking of, Dean Koontz borrowed the idea for his semi-recentish book 'The Taking'), or the \"Turn the dial up to 11\" line from the movie \"This is Spinal Tap\". Aside from all of these references, the story itself was a \"pisser\", as Beaver would say. Three parts sci-fi, one part fantasy and a tablespoon-full of tongue-in-cheek prophecy, it's definitely a rollercoaster. I mentioned to friends when I started this book (or maybe I just wrote it down, I dunno) that it reads like a movie. Lots of King's books do, which is possibly why so many have been adapted, but this one especially felt that way to me. I would set the book down for a minute, to freshen my drink, or move a cat-paw that was creeping oh-so-subtly onto the page because everyone knows that cats can't sleep next to a reading human unless they are obstructing the view in some way, and it would be just like I pressed the pause button. When I pick the story back up, I'm right back where I was, like the interruption never occurred. We start out meeting Pete, Beaver, Jonesy and Henry as adults, and then throughout the story we find out about their childhood and what (and who) bonded them together. Beaver is my favorite character. Dubbed such an appealing and cool nickname due to his habit of always chewing on a toothpick, he has a foul mouth and a heart of gold. I love the way King describes Beaver, and shows us his general character in three sentences: \"His glasses started to unfog then, and he saw the stranger on the couch. He lowered his hands, slowly, then smiled. That was one of the reasons Jonesy had loved him ever since grade school, although the Beav could be tiresome and wasn't the brightest bulb in the chandelier, by any means: his first reaction to the unplanned and unexpected wasn't a frown but a smile.\" This passage makes me love him too. He's got a bit of innocence about him... and a kind of raunchy purity. I'm not going to go into the rest of the guys, that would take a long time... but I would like to talk about the characters. Suffice it to say that each of the friends are perfect and flawed in their own ways, but none of them are as dear to me as Beaver. I love Duddits too, who is really innocent perfection epitomized. He's got Down Syndrome, and with that a kind of extrasensory ability that makes him special- probably more special than anyone else. Roberta Cavell, Duddits's mom, is another of my favorite characters. She's got very small parts in this story, but each and every one of them touch my heart. The woman is almost saintly! When Duddit's leaves with Henry, and Roberta crumples, it just breaks my heart. King spent barely two pages on this, but I felt it as if it was happening to me. Abe Kurtz, the main military madman, is plain old crazy like a fox and as unpredictable as a tornado. Owen Underhill is Kurtz's right hand man, but one who happens to still have a spark of humanity in him. And speaking of humanity, this brings me to Mr. Gray... Mr. Gray is an alien life form whose sole purpose is to survive by any means necessary. Not just himself, but his race. These aliens are alien in every sense of the word. They are inhuman, don't understand humans, don't understand our emotions or thoughts or anything. They just seek to continue to exist and emotionlessly do what it takes to ensure that. They are smart, but in a wily, calculating way. Mr. Gray finds and infiltrates Jonesy's body, in a kind of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" way. (This happens quite early in the story, so I'm not giving anything away, don't worry.) What happens then though, to Mr. Gray specifically, is very interesting to me. King is really a master at showing us what humanity looks like. All parts of it. His stories are all people stories in which horror or gore or whatever is used to bring out the best and worst in us. If King ever had a theme, that's it. But here we have an inhuman, emotionless, calculating being who has none of that - only a relentless will to propagate. And then King shows us how this being starts to become human. And this I find fascinating, because it's one thing to plumb the depths of someone's soul and find out who they really are, but it's something else entirely to watch someone becoming that person. \"Becoming\" is usually depicted as that which we know turning into something we don't know, something that terrifies or horrifies us. People turning into monsters, vampires, or werewolves are the most common supernatural cases. But slowly slipping into madness is another case, and 'The Shining' comes instantly to mind as Jack becomes more and more unstable and dangerous. But here we have an alien becoming human - craving food, thrilling in the human emotions that it's never before experienced, enjoying curiosity for the first time, feeling the rush of adrenaline and wanting more and more - and I thought it was fascinating to see humanity being the unknown and feared trait... to see things from the other perspective. Anyway, I really did enjoy this story this time around. I enjoyed it the first time, but this time I feel like I got so much more out of it. This book is entertaining in its own right, but much much more so for the Constant Reader who can spot all the references embedded within it. :) ...more Un libro extra\u00f1o de King. Me gust\u00f3.

The bad news is it's a rehash of The Tommyknockers , too, which is perhaps my least favorite of all of King's works. All right, maybe that's not quite fair. Dreamcatcher does involve aliens, a secret in the woods, and telepathy, but it's not exactly a carbon copy of The Tommyknockers . It re-uses pieces of many of King's works.

The bad news is it's a rehash of The Tommyknockers , too, which is perhaps my least favorite of all of King's works. All right, maybe that's not quite fair. Dreamcatcher does involve aliens, a secret in the woods, and telepathy, but it's not exactly a carbon copy of The Tommyknockers . It re-uses pieces of many of King's works. There's the \"adults who bonded as children and did a great thing\" theme from It . There's also the \"child with a great secret power\" trope from The Shining and/or Firestarter . Granted, Duddits is technically an adult, but he is retarded and therefore retains, quite literally, the mind of a child, as evidenced by everyone calling him by his childhood name. Duddits is also reminiscent of Tom Cullen from The Stand , as another example of the sweet and noble retarded person who, after enduring great hardship, saves the day, or at least a piece of it. Speaking of The Stand , let's talk about a nasty, virulent disease that wipes out around 99% of the population. Granted, in this case the \"disease\" is actually a creature, and the affected area is relatively small, but within that area, the terminal rates are about the same. So what's the big deal, you ask? King has always re-used certain themes in his work: kids in danger, life in Maine, narrators who are writers; why am I harping on this one book in particular? I'm harping on it because he doesn't bring anything new to plate this time. In the past, these themes were simply a framework of familiarity to hang a new story on. It was fun for long-time readers to get the references to previous characters and stories, and to feel like they knew the territory. We've been to Derry and Castle Rock so many times it feels like we belong there. But in Dreamcatcher , it doesn't feel like King's using similar elements. It feels like he's telling the same stories, albeit in bits and pieces and mixed around some. You know how you feel when you watch a movie adaptation of a Stephen King book? With a few notable exceptions, they just don't get it right. The casting is a little bit off or the script keeps the wrong parts of the story (or loses the wrong parts). The bones of the book you loved are there, but the mad doctor put them together all wrong, attaching a femur to a vertebra, or the skull to a kneecap. That's how Dreamcatcher felt to me: right pieces, wrong place. King is an amazing storyteller; he always has been. Even the books I didn't particularly like, I finished. I find that I get caught up in his stories despite myself, and I have to follow through to the end. Maybe that's the crux of my displeasure with Dreamcatcher ; I know King is capable of so much more. Authors aren't perfect. Some books are going to be better than others. You just hope that over the course of a career, the good books outweigh the weak ones. ...more First of all, let me say I can understand why some folks don't care for this one, and I don't blame you.

I like Duddits. He\u2019s not one of King\u2019s strongest characters, but I like what he represents and how, more and more, he works his way into the center of the story Even when he\u2019s been long neglected he\u2019s there and ready to help. He\u2019s stronger than anyone imagines too; in a sense, he\u2019s running the whole show. I like the complexity of the aliens. In the end, they\u2019re a very fragile fungus. They didn\u2019t build those interstellar ships. But somehow they figured out how to pilot them. Also, they\u2019re eminently seducible, and you gotta love anyone who can be easily seduced. \u201cWant to distract the bad guy who is set on destroying our world? Remind him that he loves bacon. Tell him where to get it and watch him go off and gorge himself thus slowing down and eventually derailing his evil plans.\u201d I actually didn\u2019t mind the endless gastrointestinal disasters, and I kind of thought the shit-weasels were a pretty good addition to the encyclopedia of alien monsters. I like Owen Underhill, the perfect soldier. He knows his commander is nuts and he knows how to outthink him to save the world, even if he has to sacrifice his life in the end. I like bad guy Kurtz too; sure he\u2019s a stereotypical military megalomaniac, but what more do you want from the military in a horror story than a bible-quoting nutcase who almost guarantees that the bad guys will win even if they are incompetent, because he is so god-blessed ignorant and obsessive. What didn\u2019t I like? The four friends, really. They had good back-stories, but they sure didn\u2019t hold my interest. It was almost as though I had to keep reminding myself who they were and why I should care about them. And there were no strong women in this story, and they are usually a King trademark. Okay, Duddits\u2019s mom and a couple of hardass mindless military commanders\u2026 but still imagine the kind of impact Bevy from the levy could have had on this adventure. I got tired of some of King\u2019s extended ramblings, which I usually enjoy and often admire. Finally, for me, the whole idea of the Dreamcatcher just didn\u2019t work. I know King put a lot of effort into explaining it and, really, how perfect does a metaphor have to be? But this was a story about memories and reflections, not really about dreams in their finest sense.

Now, despite all my misgivings, which compiled to keep me from reading this book for the first eight years of its existence, I wanted to knock it out and work towards my goal of completing Stephen King's library. I loved this book! The characters are so well drawn up. Pete, Henry, Jonesy, and Beaver. Plus Duddits, their \"dreamcatcher\", who they meet and rescue as boys, and who changes their lives forever. I love how we're thrown into the action early on as they're adults, then get glimpses into their childhood days which piece the story together. It's really very layered and complex. The aliens themselves, not so much, though they do tie in to the structure pretty well through the interaction of Jonesy with \"Mr. Gray.\" But the strength of this book is the principal five characters that grew up in Derry together and must now face this menace that threatens humankind. Also, I loved Kurtz! The perfect black-ops nutjob colonel. Crazy as a freakin' loon. This man might have been a military cousin to Jim Rennie from Under the Dome. Bravo, Mr. King, for weaving together this dreamcatcher. One of the more memorable novel of the early 21st Century. And just so I can say it one more time: shit weasels. ...more Ree-damn-diculous.

It just sucked. \"Desperation\" just sucked. \"Dreamcatcher\" is a different beastie altogether: \u201cYou could only compare it to farts because there was nothing else even close.\u201d Thank you, Stephen King, thank you for showing those National Book Award snobs the way. I can't, in good conscience, give this any more than three stars. It's a wretched novel, and King should be ashamed of himself for writing it.

Farts and creatures entering the world from a person's 'back door' do not a good horror novel make. The first time this happens in the book I actually laughed aloud.

My wife knows to check the thrift stores that she frequents for King novels, and \u201cDreamcatcher\u201d was one that she found. I didn\u2019t know anything about the story, but sat down to begin reading a week and a half ago or so. The story is about an alien invasion, and that was enough to get my interest. Although there are many aspects involved, including four friends caught in the middle of it, the military cleanup, conflicts between the soldiers and their questionable orders, and many memories and flashbacks, the real story is about a Down syndrome man named Duddits who changes everything. This is the first King novel that came close to bringing me to tears, and his ability to make his reader really like and care about poor Duddits is excellent. I don\u2019t think I will ever look at a person who has Down syndrome the same way again. 3.75\tCharacters Presenting realistic, interesting characters is one of King\u2019s strong suits, and he does not fail here. The four friends, Owen Underhill, and the cast they encounter in their adventures are all complex and involving. Extra points go for Kurtz, the insane military leader in charge of the government cleanup. He always kept me on my toes. Duddits was also a great character that I cared about, and is central to everything. 3.5\tPace King is a master of suspense, but sometimes it is aggravating. He spends a lot of time establishing background and building things up before he lets loose. It\u2019s a good pace, but there were parts that almost bored me. The last few hundred pages had me on the edge of my seat though. 3\tStory The alien invasion in the novel is original, but the concept of four childhood friends with a strange gift being caught in the middle of it an old friend to the author. I thought the most engaging parts of the story were about the military cleanup. I also thought that Duddits was a brilliant part of the story, and King does a good job of getting his reader to care for him. I have to dock the story points because of the lack of research by the author and his editors. Among other mistakes that I consider elementary, he refers to a \u201ccook\u2019s third\u201d in an Army unit (that sounds like a Navy designation), and also says that an H&K Mp5 fires 5.56mm ammunition when it fires 9mm. They\u2019re small details, but the mistakes took my attention away from the story and ruined the suspension of disbelief for moments at a time. 2.5\tDialogue King is very good at dialogue, but there were a few parts that felt weak or too wordy/preachy. There were a few times when Henry, and even crazy Kurtz who had a reason to talk crazy, stopped being realistic. 5\tStyle/Technical There is no doubt in my mind that this book is an excellent example of a seasoned, veteran author using the tools of his trade to produce a superior novel. Most of my Stephen King material has been his earlier works, and he has grown and learned a lot in the years. His shifting viewpoints, flashbacks, changes of scenery, presentation of dreams, and integrating everything into the narrative is nothing short of amazing. 3.6\tOverall \u201cDreamcatcher\u201d is a good alien invasion story, but a better examination of the human condition than most escapist fiction. Jonesy\u2019s battle against the alien entity possessing his body, Kurtz\u2019s mad logic, and everything about Duddits are amazing examples of fiction writing. My only real complaint would be a degree of predictability after the midway point. At the same time, I think the novel also gives some insight into Stephen King\u2019s mindset. He clearly is not familiar with things of a military nature in any way, and apparently neither are his editors. This tells me that he doesn\u2019t really understand the people who volunteer to serve and put on those uniforms. As a result, most of his soldier characters come across as raving lunatics. It serves his story, but it\u2019s an example of how he does not know that part of society and assigns unfair stereotypes to them. ...more I've put off writing a review because Becky wrote the review to end all reviews and said it all!

Here goes... I read this the week it first came out in 2001 because I always read his books as soon as they come out. At breakneck speed more often than not. I tend to re-read and savor the books later, but the first reading is like a \"fix\" I have been Jonesing for, so taking my time is not really an option. I was especially happy to get this particular fix because I had been so devastated when King had his accident. This book was proof he had not left us. This is one of the few I never went back to re-read. Until now. I couldn't even think of this book without flenching my glutes, so my aversion was understandable. This time around I wonder what took me so long! Yes, I giggled through the horrendous gas and \"birthing\" of the poop weasels, but once I got over that I really enjoyed this densely layered book. I always love when King writes about aliens. In Dreamcatcher, aliens have been present on our world for a long time. The military is very aware of their probes and visits. The book starts with 4 childhood friends, all grown up now, meeting for their annual hunting trip in a cabin dead center of ground zero. Needless to say, with them being King characters, they all carry a lot of emotional baggage. The guys share a LOT of history that King peels like an onion in flashbacks thoughout the story. At the onset of a huge storm, the aliens arrive, en masse, in thier ship. They are broadcasting, in highly recognizable human voices, English and French, \"There is no infection here.\". Has an ominous ring to it, huh? Fortunately they land in the woods in the middle of just about nowhere. Not quite so fortunate is the fact that it's hunting season. The military swoops in to contain the \"virus\" the aliens have introduced, (guess they were lying about the \"no infection\" part) and begin these efforts by rounding up all the hunters and corralling them. These particular aliens seem intent only on survival. They aren't out to wipe out mankind...unless humans interfere with said survival, that is. In addition to the \"grey boys\" we've come to expect of aliens, there is a red, mosslike growth of a virus humans can become infected with AND a small creature, the aforementioned poop weasels that incubate in the human digestive track, eventually eating thier way out. Our four hunting friends end with the fate of the world, literally, in their hands with the help of thier very, very special fifth friend from childhood. One of the effects of close proximity to the aliens is ESP. Our friends have shared a bit of a mental bond and heightened perception since childhood, and this just ups their mental abilities to the nth. It may sound cool to be able to read your neighbors, family and friends minds, but if you carry that thought to the final conclusion...it's not! It causes havoc, distrust, hate, fear and above all panic. I felt panic was the tone of this book. It takes place over the course of just 2 days, and beginning to end is constant action at breakneck speed. It is NOT a slow boil. ...more I've read a lot of Stephen King books over the years. So many in fact that in order to read new King I'm finding myself reading some of his books I purposefully avoided for many years like \"Dreamcatcher.\" This one had always had a bad reputation as a weird book with an equally weird film adaptation.

So many in fact that in order to read new King I'm finding myself reading some of his books I purposefully avoided for many years like \"Dreamcatcher.\" This one had always had a bad reputation as a weird book with an equally weird film adaptation. But then I thought, \"I like weird things! I love aliens and Lovecraft! King wrote this book high on pain killers following his car accident, so this will be awesome! Haters gonna hate, readers gonna read!\" (I have strange thoughts, leave me alone). So I jumped right into this book ready for aliens to occasionally pop out of butts. Another reviewer had it just right: All the right pieces were here, they were just put together wrong. This book had the bones of another \"It\", one of my all time favorites. Another group of kids from Derry, Maine who have something happen to them as children that effects them for the rest of their lives. But this time around...it just didn't work. The characters just aren't interesting enough. Two of them, Jonesy and Henry, are WAY too similar to the point of confusion. The only likable and interesting character, Beaver, doesn't stick around in the book for too long. The book overstays it's welcome. At 620 pages, it is much shorter than some of King's longest works but the story just can't sustain it. This book needed an editor in the worst way! I believe somewhere in this book is a truly excellent short story or novella. The bad guy, Colonel Kurtz (Yes, they reference that this is a ridiculous name, the horror, the horror) is cartoonishly evil. They have to make him that way because for most of the book he's right. The alien's are invaders here to conquer Earth. Drastic measures should be taken! I don't have as big a problem with the butt buster aliens as a lot of other readers but they definitely didn't add much to the story. Scary to have an alien inside you but if I heard one more fart \"joke\" I was going to lose it. This definitely isn't as bad as his worst work, \"Lisey's Story\", but it's up there. But never fear, my quest to read all of his works continues because even when his stuff devolves into same shit, different day, it is lightyears ahead of almost everybody else. ...more

They go on an annual hunting trip, but barely speak throughout the year. This year's trip is different - they see moving lights, get stuck in a terrible snow-storm, and meet someone who is... not entirely right. Dreamcatcher is a strange book. On one hand we have this motif we've seen before - children who do something important in their childhood which ties together with some happening in their adulthood. It is a prime example of such a story. Yet Dreamcatcher doesn't feel the same as It - it's much more concrete where It seemed whimsical. It's threat is more direct, the execution more ruthless and realistic. Something that doesn't appeal to many people, is that Dreamcatcher is old-school science-fiction. It's just not something you'd expect from the Stephen King stereotype - the archetypical horror writer. Dreamcatcher deals with an UFO that lands on American soil. The UFO holds extraterrestrial beings. The beings are not very friendly, and the US army makes an appearance. Imagine a 90s Hollywood movie with aliens - Dreamcatcher is exactly that, in book form. The problem with this subject is that it seems so fake, so done , and so last century. No one is interested in aliens any more, at least not like this. The time of green men with big heads has passed, and the market of Dreamcatcher with it. It doesn't help that, though quite an interesting concept, the procreation of the aliens is just icky . I've always appreciated that King calls a cow a cow, and if a story involves pee/poo/vomit/blood/brain goo, he will tell you so. In this book, aliens bury themselves in the digestive system of humans - and they come out again too. Out of your bottom. Giving them the nickname of shit-weasels. The way society works, we see books that deal with things like farts as immature. A focus on bodily functions is childish, and not suited for adults. This manifests itself in how in not a single apocalyptic story, anyone worries about toilet paper. Zombie brains, sure, but poo is a topic not discussed. Dreamcatcher pushes this boundary. Although I didn't always enjoy the direction of the story (US army themes are just not my cup of tea), I loved the journey these characters go through. Dreamcatcher is well written, engaging, and has a terrific nail-biter of an ending. A huge part of the plot revolves around mind-reading, which I always find a fascinating subject. All in all, I don't regret reading the seven-hundred pages of Dreamcatcher . ...more I'm a King fan, though I'll be the second to admit that he's had his fair share of misses amidst the hits.

We've seen great stories from him using this basic theme in the past (\"It I'm a King fan, though I'll be the second to admit that he's had his fair share of misses amidst the hits.

The concept has promise, and it's territory he's visited before: A group of childhood friends stumble upon something strange and scary/amazing, and it follows them through to adulthood, at which point things go haywire. We've seen great stories from him using this basic theme in the past (\"It\" and \"The Body,\" a.k.a. \"Stand By Me,\" come immediately to mind). \"Dreamcatcher\" could've been good, too...but it isn't. Without rehashing the plot or giving too much away (...not that you should read this on your own or be concerned about spoilers), I can say that the new twist to the old premise involves a disabled boy whom the group of friends save from some nasty bullies. As it turns out, this boy isn't simply disabled; he has a gift, a kind of second sight, and as thanks for their bravery he bestows some of his powers unto his new friends. This gift strengthens the bond between all of the boys and changes their lives forever. As grownups, however, the men learn that there may have been a grander purpose to their new abilities...and then, somehow, the book devolves into a plot about aliens that makes \"The Tommyknockers\" seem totally plausible, as well as a massive military conspiracy, and a whole host of other bizarre and nonsensical things that aren't even fun if taken as fantasy. Stephen King has successfully done fantasy (see: \"The Eyes Of The Dragon\") in the past, too, as well as sci-fi and even speculative fiction, if you'd prefer to call it that (see: \"The Stand\"; \"Under The Dome\"). He can do it well. If \"Dreamcatchers\" were all someone had read in King's library, though, you'd never believe that. It took three attempts for me to get through the book, and I wish I hadn't been so tenacious. I even gave the film adaptation a shot, because the cast features some of my favourite actors at the time (Morgan Freeman, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis and many others), but it too was laughably, impossibly bad. Still, if you're dying to see how it all turns out, or if you're a King devotee who feels compelled to never skip a single story, I'd recommend the terrible film over the terrible book. At least the movie will only take 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back, versus however long it will take you to slog through 600+ pages of the wrong kind of horror. ...more Lots of gross outs and a narrow escape for human-kind.

:\u03a1 ...more Trinaest godina nakon prvog citanja, ponovo sam uzivao u ovoj ludoj, mracnoj i neozbiljnoj knjizi. Jer ovo jeste jedna neozbiljna knjiga, jedan Kingov hir, i uspesan pokusaj da se pozabavi temom vanzemaljaca. Zbog cega je ljudi ozbiljno shvataju, nije mi jasno. Real roller coaster alien ride, sa svim svojim manama i nedostacima, meni je pruzio jos jednom opustanje i sjajnu zabavu. 4/5 3.5 stars This was the second Stephen King book I ever read. (Well, I read Salem's Lot and Pet Sematary back in High School, but that doesn't really count). What I mean to say is that after Stephen King's arguable magnum opus (in my opinion, It ) pretty much changed my life and got me serious about reading and writing, I then moved on to Dreamcatcher ... (the only other King novel that happened to be sitting on my family's overwrought bookshelf). Back then, I guess I didn't really know what to make of this This was the second Stephen King book I ever read. (Well, I read Salem's Lot and Pet Sematary back in High School, but that doesn't really count). What I mean to say is that after Stephen King's arguable magnum opus (in my opinion, It ) pretty much changed my life and got me serious about reading and writing, I then moved on to Dreamcatcher ... (the only other King novel that happened to be sitting on my family's overwrought bookshelf). Back then, I guess I didn't really know what to make of this. I had already seen the film a few times. I remember that quite well; it was not a very good one, and if it weren't for a few cool moments - such as when Morgan Freeman and his men blow up the alien ship; and the part when the boys find Josie Rinkenhauer in the sewage pipe - I would say that it was totally forgettable. Without a doubt, the film does not do the book much justice. Because contrary to what most people would have you believe - (those on Goodreads included) - Dreamcatcher is galaxies away from being a poor effort. While it certainly doesn't come close to his great books - ( It , Pet Sematary , Doctor Sleep ), etc) - I would never say that it falls as low as what I feel personally were his worst books - (not bad , but average stuff, like Thinner , The Dark Half , and Four Past Midnight ). Stephen King has dealt with the topic of UFO's only occasionally ... and never to great result. One must surely notice the fact that his three major alien novels ( The Tommyknockers , Under The Dome , and this ) have all been recieved with average-to-negative reviews by most of his critics and readers. I'm not quite sure why this is, because even though I didn't like Under The Dome (which admittedly doesn't have aliens in it until the end; and boy, does he fuck them up), I actually really enjoyed The Tommyknockers . Similar to that, the aliens in Dreamcatcher are far from your cliched concept of them. That's one of the things that I really loved about this book - (especially on re-reading it these last two weeks). The alien element to this story is pretty damned original. They crash by accident in the snowy woods of northern Maine, and are pretty much refugees, which the American military does not respond to kindly. Except they're not your typical, silver-bodied X-Files archetypes, but a single-minded non-physical entity, which only takes a physical form in a human's mind, based on their own subconscious perception of what an alien should look like. In reality, their only physical trace is the hideous byrum fungus that they have taken onto Earth with them, and which starts to spread and infect the unfortunate hunters that have decided to get away for a weekend in the Jefferson Tract. (Then, of course, there's the infamous \"shit weasels\" that this byrum , or \"Ripley Virus\" implants into the bowels of its more unlucky victims). I won't fuck around with talking about the premise anymore. I just wanted to stress that I think Stephen King should be appreciated for giving his fans something entirely different from what is admittedly a pretty common subject. This book does also have its typical King tropes, which (if you're a fan) is always most certainly welcome. This book has so many references to It - (the inscription and graffiti on that standpipe monument in Derry made me even more excited the second time around; that one paragraph was so poignant, and yet creepily suggestive, as well. I wonder if King ever plans on bringing back Pennywise. Generally I'm not into those kinds of sequels ... but man, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't totally into the idea of that one). The four main characters - (and Duddits, of course) - are, I think, some of the best that King was given us. All four are flawed, realistic, but likeable people, and it is genuinely sad what happens to some of them later in the story. The whole segment with Jonesey being locked inside his mind was also awesome. Kurts and Mr. Grey were both intriguing and fun-to-hate villains (although I actually kind of liked Mr. Grey ... aside from the fact that he killed civilians). The wintry setting lends itself perfectly to the story, and places it apart from most of King's other stuff. I love how King really pushed the violence up in this book, going intentionally for a B-Movie kind of tone, with its many gruesome deaths which were sometimes goofy, but always disgusting. I'm pretty used to King's use of violence, which is pretty mild compared to some writers, but some parts of this book fucking shocked me with their vividly gross descriptions that made me feel like I could almost feel the pain myself. That part when Mr. Grey forces that truck driver to thrust a pen into his eye socket, and the part when he wills that shopkeeper to jam his fingers so far up his nostrils that he almost touches his brain were particularly hard to forget. There is no denying that this book does become pretty slow, and even tedious, at times. But for the most part, there are just so many great moments that make up for it. Dreamcatcher is never going to be considered one of Mr. King's greatest books. And it really isn't very scary, which is my favourite kind of King story. But it is a delightfully disgusting, refreshingly original, frequently funny, occasionally moving, and easily memorable read. ...more \u00c9pico. No tengo nada malo que decir sobre este libro.
