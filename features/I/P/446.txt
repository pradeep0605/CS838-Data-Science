Although I found the plot fairly predictable, the romance was sweet and gentle and the fact that I knew where the story was heading didn't seem to dampen my enjoyment. The lack of angst was refreshing and a nice change from my current string of tension-filled reads.

Her younger sister, Sydney, has a knack for creating just the right hairstyles for her clients.

The fun starts when Sydney flees with her daughter from an abusive man and returns to the home she abandoned. Claire\u2019s quiet life is suddenly thrown in turmoil, and both sisters are forced to deal with their past. Claire gradually succumbs to the charms of the man next door, and Sydney finds love with a childhood friend. Garden Spells was a light, pleasant, and enchanting romance that was just a little too sweet, sentimental, and predictable for me. The men are too good to be true, the villains are stereotypes, and there\u2019s very little conflict. I loved the big and cantankerous apple tree with a mind of its own that throws apples at unsuspecting victims. Not my cup of tea, but should please those readers who like magic, love, and happy endings. ...more So good, I read it twice.

They just made you feel good.\u201d Perfectly sums up the way I feel about Garden Spells. Fun and easy to read, this novel thawed my ice box of a heart with its quirky main and secondary characters, scrumptious dishes made from flowers I haven\u2019t heard of before, postcard worthy setting, poignant rendering of forgiveness and acceptance, with just the right touch of magic realism. I particularly like the dynamics between Claire and Sydney after meeting for the first time in ten years. They\u2019re extremely dissimilar, yet drawn to each other as well, which makes their interaction painfully guarded. If you have an errant sibling whom you see infrequently, you\u2019ll know what I mean. There are two things, though, that could\u2019ve been better - the romance and the ending. I found the romance a tad too cheesy for my taste, but that's just me I guess. Not your fault book, I just have a low tolerance for romance nowadays. Another is the predictable ending. Overall though, an enjoyable light read, as is usual for <---A>Sarah Addison Allen</---A> books. Her books are my mint sorbet, my palate cleanser, when I\u2019m in between weightier or frustrating reads, or to recover from a book slump. And that says a lot about Sarah Addison Allen 's writing. ...more It is really difficult for me to find a book that suits me. I love stories, and I love to read.

I complained to my husband and cursed the book, \u201cStupid book.\u201d But then, I did something uncharacteristic of me (with books); I gave it another chance. I read on, even struggling a bit with the second chapter. Funny thing, I had been right to judge it by its cover, title and blurb, because by the end I had really grown to love the magical world Sarah Addison Allen had created. Garden Spells is a fairy tale of sorts with an enchanted apple tree, envy, edible spells, love and a happy ending. It turned out to be everything that I had hoped it would be. And I learned that you can\u2019t judge a book by its first chapter.

Fate is heavy-handed in Bascom. There's no escaping your name and there's no escaping your heritage, even though Sydney Waverley, just like her mother before her, has tried. Sydney grew up a Waverley, but didn't embrace the stigma associated with her name in the way her sister, Claire, did. Sydney's been everywhere, man, but her free spirit has finally been trapped by an abusive husband and her commitment to her 5 year old daughter. When Sydney finally musters the courage to escape, there's only one place for her to go--back to Bascom and a sister who despises her. When Sydney returns, she must confront the past, mend her relationship with Claire, and embrace what it means to be a Waverley--all the while knowing that trouble is most likely following her and could threaten the very lives of those she loves the most. Garden Spells is a nice little book. Just awfully darn nice. Everything's beautiful and brimming with Southern charm, the characters could have been pulled off the street in Mayberry and sprinkled with pixie dust, and we know there's a happily ever after awaiting everyone. I'll give Allen credit--there were some unexpected thorns and rough edges in a plot that was as insubstantial as an angel food cake (this also means that I laughed my ass off when I read the 1 star reviews on this book to find so many readers of \"wholesome\" novels were disgusted and couldn't go on when the first F bomb was dropped or during the first sex scene), but it was predictable and sweet and light-reading. It was the perfect book for vacation because I didn't have to think much and I could easily pick the plot line back up after being distracted. However, that's generally not what I'm looking for in a novel, so I don't think I'll seek out any more Allen books (although I already have The Sugar Queen on my shelf--it may go with me on my next vacation, but that will probably be my last encounter with Allen's particular brand of magical realism). There were some groan-worthy moments (such as when Ariel Clark is described as smelling like \"peaches and cottonwood\"--wtf kind of fragrance is that? Who smells like a cottonwood?), but there were some characters who held some undeniable charm for me. The most interesting character, unfortunately, wasn't a main character (I found the Waverley sisters to be rather tiresome). It is Evanelle, an elderly relative of the Waverley sisters, whom I found the most interesting. Evanelle's peculiar talent manifests itself as a compulsive need to give things to people--specific things which always turn out to have a purpose, though Evanelle never knows what that purpose is when giving (at one point she is overwhelmed by the need to give a woman a box of condoms, even though the woman's husband was left impotent after a WWII injury; however, she has been having an affair and ends up pregnant because she doesn't accept Evanelle's gift). The chain of events that occur after Evanelle presents a gift to someone are often the best stories in the novel. Many of the other reviews have compared this novel to Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman, another magical realism book about two polar opposite sisters from a magical family, and some other readers have gone so far as to suggest that Allen has plagiarized Hoffman. I don't think that's quite the case, but the similarities are hard to ignore. However, I enjoyed Practical Magic immensely because there is an undertone of darkness and menace, which Garden Spells lacks. Also, Hoffman includes a little more magical realism while the magic in Allen's book is pretty light. In fact, Allen might be best labeled as \"Hoffman-Lite.\" And that's why I think I'll stick with Hoffman from this point on.

Sydney left her hometown in an attempt to run from what it means to be a Waverley, and the magical gifts they have, as well as from the heartbreak caused by the breakup with her high school boyfriend. While Sydney bounced from city to city, Claire remained in their childhood home where their late grandmother lived and led a quiet life of solitude until Sydney came back into her life. Garden Spells centers around the two Waverley sisters but manages to incorporate a full cast into a small amount of pages without overdoing it. My favorite character was Evanelle, a \u201csecond or third or fourteenth cousin\u201d that also has her own unique gift: she would get sudden urges to gift individuals with certain items which they would inevitably need sooner or later. She was a complete hoot and added a distinct sense of humor to the tale. We\u2019re also given passages told from the points of view of love interests, other townsfolk and six-year-old Bay who possesses the gift for knowing just exactly where things belong. Garden Spells is so heartwarming and realistic seeing two sisters who had grown apart over the years reintegrate one another into their lives. On top of the wonderful magical flairs, it\u2019s also the perfect read for fans of what I like to call \u201cfoodie fiction\u201d. Claire, being an owner of a catering business, is often cooking and her delicious sounding masterpieces are described in intricate detail. \u2018Anise hyssop honey butter on toast, angelica candy, and cupcakes with crystallized pansies made children thought. Honeysuckle wine served on the Fourth of July gave you the ability to see in the dark. The nutty flavor of the dip made from hyacinth bulbs made you feel moody and think of the past, and the salads made with chicory and mint had you believing that something good was about to happen, whether it was true or not.\u2019 Sarah Addison Allen is one of my favorite authors and I don\u2019t say that lightly. I can always count on her books to have a whimsical tale that will put a smile on my face and lead me to hours of enjoyment. Oddly enough, I didn\u2019t always have such a high opinion of her. Garden Spells was actually the first book of hers I read and I honestly didn\u2019t care for it, but after going on to read all of her works and loving each and every one of them, I knew I had to revisit this and give it another shot through a different set of eyes. The second time around went much better and I enjoyed it greatly. Why the change? I remember the first time I kept comparing it to the movie/book Practical Magic without bothering to note the differences plus it was my first foray into magical realism so I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect. (I also read The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake around the same time and disliked it greatly so I\u2019m thinking a re-read of that may be in order.) This is the first time I\u2019ve gone back attempting to give a book I disliked another shot. In my mind it always seems like a waste of time because if you disliked it the first time, why would it be different the second time? Well, if I take anything from this experience it\u2019s that it won\u2019t be the last time. ...more Well, this is tricky. I really enjoyed the book.

And Bay, who at five, sometimes steals the show with her knowing where things belong. In truth, she knows they (Bay and her mom) belong in her mother\u2019s southern hometown of Bascom, North Carolina and - more specifically - in her great-grandmother's mysterious, ancient house. Sydney turned to Bay, who closed her eyes quickly. Ever since that night, the only time she got to hear the good stuff was when no one thought she was listening. \u201cLet\u2019s not wake her.\u201d Still it is Claire and Sydney\u2019s story. It is a book that definitely falls under the genre of \u201cmagical-realism\u201d; it is both bright with light and fraught with shadow, like dappled rays of sunshine through a curmudgeonly old apple tree. And it\u2019s a romance. Claire is the older sister, who likes cooking with the mystical plants from her garden, running her creative catering business, and sticking close to home. Oh, and being alone. That way she doesn\u2019t have to worry about abandonment. Sydney, who ran away from home at eighteen and is back after ten years, is seeking sanctuary with her daughter, and can give anyone a \u201cgood hair day\u201d. But love finds them anyway. And the apple tree has a few secrets also. It throws apples at people who don\u2019t want them, and makes others climb up ladders to get to them. In hindsight, I should have guessed some of its secrets; however, I realized I wasn\u2019t even trying. I was just along for Ms. Allen\u2019s enjoyable ride.

And a visit to the library sealed the deal when it was the book that leaped out at me (no, not literally- though if I lived in the author's Waverley family world it might really happen).

And argh, this was another one that was so wonderful that I'm sad to have put it off for so long. Small town, sisters, family, magic, and summer love. Sigh... didn't want to leave. And I don't have to because there is more. The story has multiple story threads and narrators, but it starts with change for Claire Waverley. A handsome new neighbor, her odd aunt sharing her gift, and Sydney the wild Waverley sister finally home after ten years and bringing her daughter, Bay. Sydney's arrival causes a breath of air to sweep through the sleepy little town. And the apple tree in the Waverley garden feels the ripples and works its wiles. Claire is the homebody. She loves her home and her connection to family. She tends the garden that grows at the foot of the old apple tree. Her food is sought by those who need some magic in their lives. Aunt Evanelle has the gift of giving the precise item people need before they tend to need it, but losing her husband has left her lonely until finally she is given someone to keep. Now there is Sydney who has a gift with hair, a hard past, and a desire for redemption when she comes home to keep her child safe. And Bay who knows where things belong especially that she and her mother belong in the old house with the garden, that her aunt keeps everything in its place and holds their handsome friendly neighbor at arms' length, and that some one special has been waiting for her mother to return back to her roots. Yes, change has come and the old apple tree in the garden has been waiting. I slipped into this warm, easy tale of magical realism like one would a comfortable natty sweater. I loved the setting of the town, the old house that is full of magic, the garden of edible flowers and growing things, the whimsical apple tree, the colorful characters, and the gently-paced plot full of sisterly reconciliation, love, growth, and some challenges left to be won. It was all in the little things that I was drawn in and felt connected. Claire's sumptuous food and well-rooted reliable nature, Evanelle's wry wisdom, Sydney's keen observation of human nature, and young Bay's sense of rightness and place. Loved it. Then there was Tyler, the man who fell for Claire and wouldn't give up, the snooty Clarks and their posses, the heartbroken Fred who still needs to find his way, Henry and his granddad who appreciate mature, grounded women. Things happen and life has a way of surprising one, but there wasn't much drama. So the everyday was where the magic was found. In summary, I loved it and would easily recommend it to those who love Contemporary Small Town Fiction, Romance, and a dab of magical realism. ...more I saw Sarah Addison Allen's new book \"Sugar Queen\" at Barnes & Noble and thought it looked interesting, but was unwilling to pay the price for a hardback book on an untried author.

I love gardens and books where people have green thumbs, unlike myself. The garden is a main character in this story, specifically the apple tree. And a book with a garden as a main character makes my day. Each Waverly in the book has a talent that makes them extra ordinary. There's no wand waving or incantations, only recipes, haircuts, random gift giving, and a heightened sense of what seems right. I've read some of the other reviews and agree with several. I agree with the reviewer who said this book is very sweet....it is sweet, so if you're looking for something jaded and sarcastic, read something else. I agree with the reviewer who said that underneath the magic is a story about extra-ordinary people and the challenges they face as they try to find their happy ending. And I definitely agree with the reviewer who said they couldn't put the book down and was late to everything....me too... I cannot speak on whether the book is similar to \"Practical Magic\" the book as I haven't read it and I absolutely don't think it very similar to \"Practical Magic\" the movie. The movie seems somewhat dark and twisty and this book is light, energetic and postive. All the 'kitchen magic' ellicits mostly positive things- understanding, clarity, good memories, etc. Even though sometimes those positive things lead to the more negative emotions like guilt or remorse about something you've done. This book is ultimately about relationships- romantic and familial- and all the trials involved in making those relationships work. This is a book to sink into and simply enjoy...maybe with a mint julep on the veranda. The author does not beat you in the head with her agenda or attempt to brain you with a serious message. It is simply an enjoyable read that will have you looking a little closer whenever you pass an apple tree. ...more Original post at One More Page I've heard so many good things about Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen, but it took me a while before I acquired it and even some more time before I decided to read it.

They're those books that you just sink into effortlessly, almost like it was an old friend welcoming you with warm food after a long day's travel. I am very, very glad to say that Garden Spells is one of them. :) Claire Waverley has lived alone for a long time now, choosing to stay in the Waverley house, running her catering business that offers the strangest but life-altering delicacies. Being a Waverley, Claire possesses a kind of magic that is unique to her: she can cook food from their garden that can shape the minds and moods of people who eat them. Claire is content with living alone and is not in any hurry to relinquish control over her routines until her wild and rebellious sister Sydney comes home with her daughter. Claire's quiet life is turned upside down as she deals with her sister's homecoming, and she tries desperately to stay in control even if she's afraid of the changes this would bring in her life. Garden Spells , in a word, is lovely. This book reminds me of Marisa de los Santos' books, Love Walked In and Belong to Me , both of which I loved. The prose is lyrical but never flowery, the characters quirky but never too much that they'd be annoying or forced. I love that all characters had something going on with them -- even the apple tree had a personality. Just like Waverley magic, there's something really magical about this book, just enough that you wouldn't question the people's abilities or the things they believed in the little town of Bascom. Granted, there isn't anything that surprising with regards to the book's plot, but there's just a certain charm in this book that would stop you from caring too much. It's like you want to live with them there. This book should also not be read while hungry because all the descriptions of food made me hungrier! It makes me wonder if there is some truth in the life-altering food that Claire makes. Maybe if I put candied violets in my cake...? Haha, right. I can dream. It's not often I let out a contented sigh at the end of a book, but this got one out of me. Sigh. If all of Sarah Addison Allen's books are as yummy and as magical as Garden Spells , then consider me a fan. I can't wait to get my hands on her other books. :) ...more What I thought of this book changed dramatically every time I sat down to read it.
