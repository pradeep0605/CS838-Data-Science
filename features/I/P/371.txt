They were either her servants in some previous life or some freaks definitely not from this earth. I mean, 1) Zoey speaks rudely to them. 2) Zoey never tells the truth. 3) Zoey never told them about anything. (personal) 4) Zoey disrespects them. 5) Zoey hurts them. But still they have the compassion to call her their \"friend\". *rolling eyes* *I would have been a pretty popular girl by now if this shit happened in the real world* She, ladies and poor gentlemen, has 3 boyfriends and then has the audacity to call other people sluts. And I actually like Heath a-lot. I just hate Zoey for screwing it all up. Fighting, fighting. (not even fighting) Zoey using the elemental powers made me go like, *Even this baby is fighting better than you...* BUT WAIT! Aphrodite is actually good! and Neferet is now the official enemy! And now I seriously hope and wish from the bottom of my heart that Zoey dies and world comes to peace. Amen. Rating: 2/5 Still going to read Chosen because there is this little hope inside me. ...more The main character, super special, gifted, popular, admired and generally perfect, newly- turned-vampire Zoey, is torn between three men (two boys and a man to be exact\u2026). 1.

Coffee, anyone? ...more I'm loving rereading the HoN! I'm preparing for a special 10th anniversary surprise for fans, and revisiting Zoey and the Nerd Herd is such fun! And the Stevie Rae scene...sob! I bawled my eyes out. Again. I'd also forgotten how funny Heath is! On to CHOSEN! While still a somewhat enjoyable read (if only because I like the idea behind the story & I enjoyed the ending), the overuse of the words (slut, stank slut, hag, hag bitch, skank, ho and ho bitch) was a bit much. It's always bothered me how casually teen girls throw around the word 'slut' as an insult .. not even teen girls, adults constantly toss that word around as well. It seems that if a girl isn't well liked, the automatic insult is to call them a 'slut' and it's really aggravating.

It seems that if a girl isn't well liked, the automatic insult is to call them a 'slut' and it's really aggravating. I mean, if you have a vagina chances are somewhere along the line you've been called a slut and honestly, it's getting ridiculous. Of course, these terms are never applied to any of the guys in the series, just the girls. Zoey, the heroine I praised in the last book for being a good role model, seems to use these words a lot to describe one particular girl who she happened to catch once in a slightly compromising position in the first book. Yet, Zoey is confused over not one, not two, but three guys in this book. Does that make her a slut? No, but it does make her extremely hypocritical, and I find it horrible that a book clearly designed for teen girls feels the need to use these words to such an extent. They appear practically every other page and it's highly distracting and preventing me from being able to stay wrapped up in the story. Also, this book constantly kept reviewing what happened in the first book to a point where it was repetitious and annoying. Every single thing from the first book, does not need to be re-explained. We are not idiots. The name dropping also continued into this book.. it's also excessive, like they're trying to say, \"Hey, look at us we're relevant to teens today!\" but it's having the opposite effect. I'll continue on with the series though. I need to know what Neferet is up to. ...more Good Lord, was this terrible. It had a great concept: a vampire finishing school.

This was not the book I got, but I'm flexible. What I got was a flat, contrived exercise in demonstrating the problems of YA writing, fantasy writing, and romance writing. Zoey never misses a chance to remind you that she is The Most Powerful Fledgling Ever. She would rather explain to you, in laborious detail, what every event means, instead of letting you judge for yourself from the consequences of each plot turn. She will describe every other character's personality for you, because apparently you're too dumb to draw your own conclusions from their dialogue and behavior (or, rather, the authors are too lazy to give them dialogue and behavior that would limn their natures organically). She rings false as a teenager, and more frustratingly, as a person that anyone would like. There's no magic in <+++>Betrayed</+++>. You might read it to get your vampire fix (although, truthfully, it doesn't even do that well), but it's not going to give you a reason to keep reading. It seems to assume that teenagers aren't familiar with good writing, so there's no reason to try very hard for them. I disagree. Try Stephanie Meyer. At least you get the impression that she respects you. ...more \u0389\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03c9 \u03ac\u03c3\u03bf, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b7\u03c1\u03c9\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b5\u03ba\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, \u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1. \u039c\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5, \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03b9\u03b6\u03b1 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc \u03ba \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 150 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9. \u0395\u03ba\u03b5\u03af \u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd, 150 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd!!!

And let me tell you, it could have been a good book. It could have been a story about a strong, independent heroine who suddenly became a vampire, who had to adapt to her new life and let go of her prejustice towards vampires. It could have been a story about a vampire politican who fights for rights of vampires (this may or may not be a character from True Blood). Come fuckin' on, it takes place in a boarding school. A fucking boarding school. For vampires. It could have been Hogwarts, only darker and sexier. Instead it turned out to be a story about one super duper amazing human being vampyre (watch the spelling!) who rides her horse of speshulness along with her little minions in the lands of Double Standards, where everyone else is a hoe. And that's the worst thing about <+++>Betrayed</+++> and about House of Night, for that matter. It is crawling with unused potential. It wasn't like Halo, that, in my opinion, had absolutely no potential. I could practically feel it in this book, there, somewhere, when Zoey and her friends weren't talking about how awesome Zoey is (gah) and calling other girls 'hoes'. And Cast(s) didn't use any of it. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Instead they used, or so the back cover of the book tells me, 'the real teen language'. Yeah, right. Besides wasted potential, writing was one of the biggest problem this book had. It was just plain shitty. Some actual quotes: \"I wanted just exclusive (and not those \"alternative academies\" that are just places where future criminals gather-gah).\" \"I continued my search... Exeter... Andover... Taft... At Misses Porter (literally- he he- that's the school's name)... Kent...\" \"But then that thing with Aphrodite happened... I took over Daughters of Night... started dating Eric... was really busy with school... blah blah.\" So... Many... Fucking...Elipses... \"Come on, please. I'm sixteen. Okay, almost seventeen, but like, whatever.\" Like, dude, for realz. \"[...] they were like mom and dad from Family Brady (hello - I watch reruns on Nickelodeon, like everyone).\" \"[...] (whatever that means- hello- I'm a teen and a vampyre beginner).\" \"[...] that Erin, blue-eyed and blond totally WASN'T BLACK.\" [WHY ARE WE YELLING THAT ERIN IS TOTALLY NOT BLACK] Look, I know that's how some teenagers talk and, hell, even I text like that, but that's not how you write a goddamn book. Which brings us to our second problem, to the author of this wonderful quotes, one and only Zoeybird Redbird. So, Zoey. You guys. Zoey is not like other girls. Zoey is special. Sun shines only for her. Poets compose songs about her beauty. Models hide their face in shame when Zoey's beautifulness walks by, wind is afraid of blowing because it might ruin her perfect hair, when she smiles mountains move, stars fall from the sky and diamonds burst in flames because they're nothing, nothing compared to Zoey's wonderful smile, Megan Fox has nothing on her, everything she wants she can turn into gold and her shit smells like Chanel No. 5. Zoey is beautiful. Zoey is wonderful. Zoey is great. Zoey is amazing. Zoey is a horrible, disgusting, repulsive person that needs to be smacked across the head. Her worst trait is that she is so fucking judgmental. She judges people she knows, wait, no, she even judges people she doesn't know, people she just saw on a street. She was like that in the first book, she is like that here. Everyone outside Zoey's group of friends is a ho, a hag, bitch, whore, racist, homophobe, anorexic, bulimic, stupid, close-minded, loser, etc. Especially Aphrodite. Oh boy, did Aphrodite get trashed in this book. She was called a slut, hoe, hag and it was without any fuckin' reason. (view spoiler) [ Because, as far as we know, Aphrodite had one fucking boyfriend and Zoey had not one, not two, but three boyfriends at the same time. (hide spoiler) ] I had two more major problems with Betrayed: one was lack of plot (but I pretty much expected that) and the other was sheer stupidity of this book. Just take a look at this quote: \"White guys should date colored woman more often.\" Colored. Colored. SHE USED THE WORD COLORED. After that lovely statement, Cast(s) wrote something along the lines that it might make them less homophobic and racist. So, if a white man dates a white woman and has no close gay friends, he is immediately a memeber of, I don't know, Westboro Baptist Church? Right. Logic.

Even if the writing is bad in a book, as long as, I connect to the characters and the story then, I can look past the painful narration. I'm finding it hard to turn a blind eye to the writing abilities of these authors. Just because there is a large audience out there for vampire novels, doesn't mean that every story should be published. Having a good idea does not equal good writing. So, why did I read the second book after hating the first book? Well, I have a bad habit of buying the whole series, even though I haven't read the first book. In addition, I like to torture myself repeatedly. I may be ridiculous in all my reasoning here, but I like to give things a try and I just can't stand the fact that I already started this series and I have to know where this story and characters are going to lead me... crazy I know. ...more I liked the Twilight Saga, but I'm CRAZY about The House of Night series.

HUH? (To utilise their stupid writing style!!) And the supposedly advanced vocabulary used by Damian? Basic!! I had to keep re-reading the sentences to try and work out what was 'advanced'. Also, I may be cynical, but it seems to me that the authors are planning to churn out book after book (equating to month by month of Zoey's life) rather than give faithful readers a decent story (eg JK Rowlings). At the rate they are going, there are close to 50 books in waiting. I'm going to see if my nieces are interested in reading these books, otherwise, they are going to the book exchange... ...more To see the full drinking game click here I think my local library hates me. There are some books I've been waiting for months to get my hands on and then there's others like <---A>P.C.</---A> and Kristin Cast's Betrayed that come into my box almost instantaneously-oh, the humanity. The good thing though is that I'm on Spring Break and had nothing to do this weekend other than babysit my father (long story short he decided to climb up a tree to rescued his crashed RC airplane and ended up breaking his foot). Wh To see the full drinking game click here I think my local library hates me. There are some books I've been waiting for months to get my hands on and then there's others like P.C. and Kristin Cast's Betrayed that come into my box almost instantaneously-oh, the humanity. The good thing though is that I'm on Spring Break and had nothing to do this weekend other than babysit my father (long story short he decided to climb up a tree to rescued his crashed RC airplane and ended up breaking his foot). Which meant reading and snarking at the second House of Night book was a way to alleviate my stress of being forced to make coconut praline smoothies every other second. So without further ado let's start drinking to Betrayed by PC and Kristin Cast. Like with the first book a lot of the same drinking rules apply. You can drink every time the Casts embarrass themselves or humanity (that's about every sentence), offend humanity in general (once again every sentence), or go on a spill about how Zoey farts rainbows and poops glitter turds (again, every sentence). I don't like being monotonous and I feel like if I continue with the same format for this drinking game you guys will get bored. So, today I'm going to focus on how to make the most of your drinking (which parts of the book are the most worth getting drunk over). 1) Any Time You Want Sexual Harassment Panda to Make an Appearance: Remember Sexual harassment panda from South Park? Well, he needs to make an appearance here. The teachers and students at House of Night really know nothing about proper behavior. I could not stand Loren despite the fact he's supposedly some \"hottie\". All I was reminded of was one of those pervy guys who seduces girls with poetry and should be on To Catch a Predator. Seriously, if your under eighteen and he's older don't go there. You may think he's mysterious and hot and age doesn't matter when it comes to romance, but the fact that he's legal and your not has lots of ramifications. Plus, don't you think if he was that great of a catch he's already have a girlfriend his age already? So yeah, Loren he might be described as looking like a model but I bet the character really isn't that hot. 2) Every Time the Casts make an ass of themselves involving LGBTs (this originally involved all humanity in general, but they really did a number to LGBTs in this book that they get their own drinking category): The Casts offend lots of people: Christians, conservatives, blondes, Native Americans, vampires (if they count as people), anyone who has a brain...but I have to say LBGTs got it the worst in this book. I really feel sorry for the character Damien he's a token character if there ever was one. I literally drank a sip of my chocolate chai every time he appeared because the Casts would make some comment about his sexuality. That he smiled gayly, or that he looked gayer than usual, that he looks like one of those old gay movie stars (Rock Hudson I'm presuming) or that he falls in love with the first gay kid that comes to school, or that he wears pink pajamas. Enough already. Damien is gay. Yes. But that doesn't mean he needs to be a walking stereotype. Write him like you'd write any character except that he dates guys not girls. It's not that difficult. 3) Every time you just roll your eyes at the \"romance\" in this book. Yes, I know it's YA and romance in YA can be flimsy at best but I have to say the romance in the House of Series makes Twilight look like the best love story ever told. There's hardly any interaction between Zoey and the boys who are all in love with her. Out of all of them I probably like Erik the best and that's only because he's hardly appears and when he does I just see my Disney crush (Prince Eric) so that makes him okay (though he is ruining that cartoon crush and that isn't okay). As for Heath, well, he deserves his own drinking game (see 6) an Loren just makes me want to bathe in bleach (see 1). Really, all the romance that's in this book is Zoey trying to figure out who she loves the best and I could care less who she ends up with. 4) Every time you swear that this series is a rework of that epically challenged fan fic, My Immortal: Last time, I jokingly mentioned that I thought this series could be based off of a rather infamous fan fic. Now, I'm starting to really wonder. Let's talk about My Immortal for a minute. Once again, I've provided a link to its Wikia page but unless you've actually experienced the eye bleeding that this fan fic causes and then read The House of Night you're not going to notice the similarities. Honestly, a lot of this story reads as a clean up version of the fan fic: the romance is as senseless at the story, there's a lot of talk about coffins, Count Chocola, about the snow making the character feel depressed, evil and pervy teachers, and a super powered Mary Sue. Heck, there's even the same generalizations about LGBTS made. Considering that the author, Tera Gillespie is reportedly from Dubai and that the Casts are from Oklahoma maybe it's just a coincidence. But you never know.... 5) Anytime the Casts talk about poetry or try to teach any sort of English lesson whatsoever: Look, I get that Cast Senior is a teacher in real life (though if my kid got in her class and I read these books, I'd be getting them transferred quicker than you can say <---C>Zoey Redbird</---C>), but I can guarantee you kids don't read the House of Night series to learn. Or at least I would hope not. I have not learned a single thing from these books except for the lows that humanity can stoop to. 6) Heath pimping: Okay, so this sort of goes with category three, but I think it sort of deserves it's own category. Heath is just unlikeable. The Casts can do nothing to make him likable. I could care less if he smokes or drinks. His addiction issues weren't what makes him a deplorable character. He's immature and stupid. And honestly I think this quote says just about everything you need to know about him: \"Erik wasn't like that at all, and I couldn't help but compare him to Heath, who would probably have been freaked that he had to room with a gay kid. Not that Heath was hateful or anything like that, but he was a typical teenage Okie boy, which tended to mean narrow minded homophobe.\" (Casts 186). Um, so was that quote suppose to make me like Heath because it doesn't? In fact, it pretty much seals my feelings for him. Obnoxious tool who just happens to be a homophobe. You know who Heath reminds me of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast. And so ends another chapter of The Unofficial House of Night Drinking Game brought to you by MJ's liver. I'll probably be reading another one of these books, Chosen, in the next month (or whenever it shows up in my reserve box). What will happen next? Will Zoey find out that she's the Nyx's long lost more powerful daughter? Will Grandma Redbird embezzle from the Cherokee bingo parlor's funds to feed her Etsy habit? Will Heath write a sad country song called \"Imprinting Why It's Not a Legitimate Excuse for Statutory Rape\"--oh wait, that's the wrong type of imprinting? Or will they all go flying in a Mercedes with the license plate 666 (if it's truly based on My Immortal that could actually happen)? ...more Really great sequel!

Plus, since I am listening to the audiobook (because reading it is just too painful), the pain is lessened...slightly. For me House of Night is the ultimate example of how a decent story can be ruined by a bad cast of characters. Zoe and her group are straight up hag-bitches-from-hell, to use a phrase they love to spew. They are hateful, cruel and just shallow and all holy hell. There is not a redeemable quality about any of them! Not a one. The fact that they are \"loyal friends\" means nothing to me, because there is no way I would be loyal to a girl who calls other girls sluts based on their sexuality and dress. Especially, when said girl (ZOE) then decides to string along three guys at the exact same time with her \"supposedly\" best friend telling her to do so! Are you serious Cast & Cast? The only decent character in the books is Aphrodite and that is because she actually gets called out on her flaws. I felt bas for her shitty situation with her family because you see that she tries to make the best out of a bad situation. Zoe, who has an equally tragic household, would be sympathetic if her attitude wasn't filled with so much superiority. Listening to this book was noticeably less painful than the first book, which was so filled with vile it should be labeled toxic, but it did make Zoe's hypocrisy ever clearer than usual. Thanks to my acute note-taking I can give you a multitude of examples: (p. 2) Damien sniffed, looking offended and superior and gayer than he usually looked (even though he is definitely gay). (Thank you Zoe for that tidbit, I would have forgotten the only defining thing about Damien's character if not for you) (p. 10) Okay, I should leave. I should turn around and walk quickly and quietly out of the courtyard. Aphrodite was probably my least favorite person at school. Actually, Aphrodite was probably my least favorite person anywhere, but purposefully listening in on what was clearly an ugly scene with her parents was just wrong wrong wrong. So I tiptoed a few feet off the path where I could hide more easily behind a big ornamental bush and have a decent view of what was going on. Aphrodite was sitting on the stone bench closest to the fountain. Her parents were standing in front of her. Well, her mom was standing. Her dad was pacing. (OMG Zoe you are such a decent person acknowledging how bad it would be to ease drop...right...before...moving to get a better look....hmm) (p. 10) Erik was the hottest guy at our school. Hell, Erik Night might be the hottest guy at any school. (Wait for it...) (p. 17) Okay, I needed to think and talk. Be normal. Forget that he was easily the most heart-stoppingly beautiful man I'd ever been near in my entire life. [...] Erik was hot and handsome and very cool. Loren Blake was a whole other universe. (Sorry Eric...) (p. 20) I didn't take over the Dark Daughters to start a war at school. I took over because Aphrodite was a bully, and she had to be stopped.(Um, I don't recall you wanting to take it over...more like it was given to you...) (p. 27) I could feel myself leaning into him, and I swear his body re sponded. I may not be highly experienced. And, hell yes, I'm still a virgin. But I'm not an utter moron (most of the time). I know when a guy is into me. And this guy\u2014for that moment\u2014was def initely into me. I covered his hand with my own, and forgetting about everything, including Erik and the fact that Loren was an adult vamp and I was a fledgling, I willed him to kiss me, willed him to touch me more. (And you wanna talk about Aphrodite.) (p. 28) \"Damn shame when something bad happens to a cute brother,\" Shaunee said, shaking her head sadly. \"Damn shame when something happens to any cute guy\u2014no matter what color, Twin,\u201d Erin said. \"We shouldn't discriminate. Cuteness is cuteness.\u201d \"You're right, as usual, Twin.\u201d \"I don't like marijuana,\u201d Stevie Rae piped in. \"It smells bad. I tried it once and it made me cough my head off and burned my throat. Plus I got some of the weed in my mouth. It was just nasty.\u201d \"We don't do ugly,\" Shaunee said. \"Yeah, and pot's ugly. Plus it makes you eat for no good reason. It's a shame the hottie football players are into that,\" Erin said. \"Makes them less hottie,\" Shaunee said. (This whole line of dialogue make me want to kick someone...) (p. 38) \"What do you mean, what about Erik?\u201d \"He's your boyfriend, Zoey.\u201d \"Not officially,\" I said sheepishly. \"Well, shoot, what does the kid have to do to make it `official'? Get down on one knee? It's been pretty obvious this past month that y'all are dating.\u201d \"I know,\" I said miserably. \"So do you like Loren more than you like Erik?\u201d \"No! Yes. Oh, hell, I don't know. It's like Loren's in a whole other world. And it's not like he and I can really date, or what ever.\" But I wasn't so sure about the whatever. Could Loren and I see each other secretly? Did I want to? As if she could read my thoughts Stevie Rae said, \"You could sneak around and see Loren.\u201d (Jesus Christ Stevie Rae!) (p 45) Aphrodite shrugged. \"I told you my vision was confusing. I couldn't tell exactly where it was, and the only reason I knew when is because I saw the date and time on your grandma's dash.\u201d \"So you're just going to let the rest of those people die?\u201d \"What do you care? Your grandma's going to be okay.\u201d \"You make me sick, Aphrodite. Do you care about anyone but yourself?\u201d \"Whatever, Zoey. Like you're so perfect? I didn't hear you caring about anyone else except your grandma.\u201d(You tell her Aphrodite) (p. 46) \"You know, having crappy parents isn't an excuse to be heart less,\u201d I said. She'd turned away and I saw her pause. Her back got really straight and when she looked over her shoulder at me I could see that her eyes were narrowed in anger. \"What would you know about it?\u201d \"About your parents? Not much except that they're controlling and your mom's a nightmare. About screwed-up parents in gen eral? Plenty. I've been living with pain-in-the-ass parent issues since my mom remarried three years ago. It sucks, but it's not an excuse to be a bitch.\u201d \"Try eighteen years of a lot more than just 'pain-in-the-ass parent issues' and maybe you'll start to get something about it. Until then, you don't know shit.\" (p. 65) His touch only made it better. Heat slammed through my body, setting me on fire. Like someone else was in control of my movements, my hand slid from Heath's shoulder, down his chest, to rub over the hard lump that was in the front of his jeans. I sucked on his neck. Rational thought flew from my mind. All I could do was feel and taste and touch. Somewhere in the depths of my mind I knew I was reacting on a level that was almost ani malistic in its need and ferocity, but I didn't care. I wanted Heath. I wanted him like I'd never wanted anything in my life. (Ahem...you have a boyfriend!!!!!) (p. 71) \"Stevie Rae, she is not my friend. I just \u2026 I dunno ...\" I floundered, trying to put the instinct that so often whispered to me and goaded me to do, or not to do, things into words. \"I guess I really do feel sorry for her sometimes. And I also think I under stand her a little. Aphrodite just wants to be accepted, but she goes about it all wrong. She thinks manipulation and lies mixed with control can force people to like her. It's what she saw at home, and that's what made her like she is now.\u201d \"Sorry, Zoey, but that's bullshit,\" Shaunee said. \"She's way too old to be acting a fool because she has a screwed-up mommy.\u201d \"Please. Just please with the blame-my-mommy-'cause-I'm-a-bitch crap,\" Erin said. \"Not to be mean or anything, but you have a screwed-up mama, too, Zoey, and you didn't let her, or your step-loser of a dad, mess you up,\" Stevie Rae said. \"And Damien has a mama who doesn't like him anymore because he's gay.\u201d \"Yeah, and he didn't turn into a hateful slut hag,\" Shaunee said. (This is exactly why I hate this bunch of bitches). (p. 93) The next performer was a kid I knew because he was a friend of Erik's. Cole Clifton was tall, blond, and totally cute. He'd fin ished twenty-second with his rendition of Romeo's \"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks \u2026\" speech. Okay, he was good. Really, really good. I heard Shaunee and Erin (espe cially Shaunee) making lots of appreciative noises, and the clap ping was furious from them when he finished. Hum ... I'd have to talk to Erik about fixing Shaunee up with Cole. In my opinion more white boys should date women of color. It was good for ex panding their horizons (especially true in Oklahoma white boys). (As a woman of color all: Say what?) (p. 101) \"Superb! Glorious! Wondrous!\" Damien made use of his large vocabulary (Oh yeah those are huge....) And finally: (108-9) \"My friend Damien is the most authentic per son I know, even when being true to himself has been a hard thing to be. He represents air well.\" \"\"My friend Shaunee is the most faith ful person I know. If she's on your side, she's there whether you're right or wrong\u2014and if you're wrong she'll tell you about yourself, but she won't desert you. She represents fire well.\" \"My friend Erin's beauty sometimes fools people into thinking she has great hair, but no brains. It's not true. She is one of the wisest people I know, and Nyx proved that she looks to the interior when she chose Erin. She represents water well.\" My friend Stevie Rae always knows when I'm happy or sad, stressed or relaxed. She worries about me; she worries about all of her friends, sometimes she is too empathetic, and I'm glad that now she has the earth she can draw strength from. She represents earth well.\" \"I'm not perfect, and I'm not going to pretend to be. What I promise you is that I sincerely want what is best for the Dark Daughters and Sons, and for all of the fledglings at the House of Night.\" I was getting ready to say that I hoped I would represent spirit well when Erik's voice rang across the circle. \"She represents spirit well!\" My four friends agreed loudly, -I would just like to call bullshit on that whole section. They are not authentic, faithful, wise, empathetic or sincere in the least. They are elitists who think they are better than everyone else, but still like to look down on other people. The only think interesting about this book is the story of the missing boys, but even that is touched on few and in-between. Plus, the reveal is so expected by any smart reader that it doesn't even qualify as a twist. Final Grade: D+ If this series did not have Aphrodite and the High Priestess, I might not even want to listen to the next book, but I will because it is just perfect to make fun of. Also, these are NOT vampires! They are backwards witches whose magic works faster than a speeding bullet. Melina out! ...more I had read the first book in the House of Night and didn't actually feel inclined to read any of the others. But I got a good deal on a set of 5 and thought I'd give it another chance. This book had less about the mythology of \"vampyres\" than the first one. Honestly, without the occasional mention of drinking blood, I would have assumed it was a book about witches. There was a lot of talk about rituals, elements, and the Daughters of Darkness or whatever they were called. Still, Zoey talked on an I had read the first book in the House of Night and didn't actually feel inclined to read any of the others. But I got a good deal on a set of 5 and thought I'd give it another chance. This book had less about the mythology of \"vampyres\" than the first one. Honestly, without the occasional mention of drinking blood, I would have assumed it was a book about witches. There was a lot of talk about rituals, elements, and the Daughters of Darkness or whatever they were called. Still, Zoey talked on and on about her super specialness and, unlike the first book, didn't seem to want to be normal. It had been a month since the end of the first book. That's not enough time to become comfortable with being different, no matter how awesome the difference might be. There were also a lot of parentheses. This popped up every time Zoey was trying to justify some thought or action, let us know that she knew what she was talking about, or to be snarky. This was just annoying. This is a first person story. We don't need the narrator to give commentary on her narration. The authors definitely let us know how they feel about drugs and alcohol use in this book. One of the more memorable lines for me was when Stevie Rae says \"I don't like marijuana. It smells bad.\" Blah Blah all the other stuff that you tell kids when you don't want them smoking pot. I'm not saying they should, but it was so PSA. It reminds me of how parents try to casually sneak in the sex talk. It just doesn't work because you damn well know it wasn't just a casual conversation. The authors also implied that drinking was more than enough reason that someone might end up dead in the river with cuts all over them and drained of blood. Zoey is so good that she only met the dead boys once because they drank and she didn't want to be around that. But Zoey the virtuous doesn't see anything wrong with flirting with a teacher. Or with having 3 boyfriends. Or with those guys not knowing she has 3 boyfriends. Because she's not giving bj's in the hallway, she's not the ho that Aphrodite is. And that word is used a lot- along with slut, bitch and tons of other derogatory terms for girls. The authors won't let Zoey say \"shit\". She has to say \"poo.\" Yet they let her walk around calling other girls derogatory names. Anyway, to the actual story. Zoey has to do her first full moon ritual and much of the book is spent with her working on it at odd hours and walking around in desolate areas of the school where she continuously happens to find people to eavesdrop on. This is actually how Zoey finds out practically everything in this book. Any plot progression happens because Zoey inadvertently eavesdrops on conversations. Zoey is so self-absorbed that she doesn't notice her bestest friend of a month, Stevie Rae, isn't looking so hot. Despite several instances of Zoey thinking about how illness is one of the signs of rejecting the change, she doesn't seem to be concerned with Stevie Rae's obvious sickness. I, on the other hand, saw this coming a mile away. Just after her super special first ritual in which all her friends become super special too, Stevie Rae dies. But Zoey doesn't have much time to grieve because Heath, Zoey's human ex that she imprinted with, goes missing. She had to find him before he dies and her imprint allows her to do so. She runs off without telling anyone to save the day. She finds him still alive because the blood of an imprinted human tastes bad. She also finds Stevie Rae, not quite dead. She kind of knew but had confirmed that the high priestess she looked up to and thought of as a second mother was really an evil bitch. The high priestess blocks her memory but Zoey gets a super special visit from Nyx and remembers everything. The book ends with whispered threats between Zoey and the high priestess. I knew the high priestess was evil in the last one. I knew the dead students weren't dead. This one did not shed any more light on that. We don't know why or how. Overall, no plot progression. I don't know if I can bring myself to read the rest. Usually if I get involved in a series, I can't wait to read the next. With this one, I actually didn't want to go right into the next book. I felt like I needed to read something that was much better. It's books like this that make me feel like the teen vamp thing has kind of jumped the shark. And I love vampire books. 2.5 from me. ...more This second book of the House of Night series gets deeper into the creepy potential set up by the first book.

Zoey has taken over as the head of the Daughters of Darkness, and wants to make it into something akin to a service club like you find at other schools. She researches ways to change the rituals into something positive and inclusive. In the meantime, she can't seem to drop her old human boyfriend, she feels guilty about neglecting her current vampire boyfriend, and hey! is the hot guest lecturer vampire attracted to Zoey, or what? Aphrodite, the former leader of the Dark Daughters, may not be as bad as she seemed, and Zoey can't help but have sympathy for her after she overhears her getting chewed out by her parents. And why is Neferet, head priestess of the school, saying Aphrodite's visions are false, when they're not? Neferet might not be as perfectly wonderful as Zoey originally thought... But most important, football players that Zoey knew are getting killed, and it looks like Heath might be next. Can she figure out who or what is killing them before it's too late? Zoey has seen what she is calling \"ghosts\", two students who have supposedly died, wandering around near the stone wall in black cloaks, and with red glowing eyes. Could they have something to do with the murders? I'm doing a series swap with Cleo, teen extraordinaire. I'm lending her my Charlaine Harris \"Southern Vampire\" series, and she's lending me this \"House of Night\" series. ...more This one started off slow, but after about fifty pages, I was captivated. I believe the reason the beginning was slow was because it basically just went over everything that happened it the last book. However, once the story got going, I couldn't put the book down. It's a really emotional book, and deals with a wide range of themes including death, and as the title suggests, betrayal. The loyalty among Zoey's group never falters though, and it really strengthens the book. I thought this one was This one started off slow, but after about fifty pages, I was captivated.

Also, Damien. He's gay, did you know that? How could you not when its mentioned over and over again. I like to think as Damien as more than just a homosexual, but the Cast's cannot stop bringing it up. Apparently that is all there is to this character. Some of what is said is almost insulting. People who treat Damien as an actual person are made out to be the best people ever. It goes a little like this: \"Damien is gay, but we treat him like a regular friend. Isn't that nice, that we treat our gay friend like any other person, oh by the way he's gay, but he's also our friend. He's our gay friend that we accept as being gay. He's gay. We are good people. THE END\" JUST STOP! Please. I consider this series like a train wreck I cannot look away from. I'm going to finish the third book, but that will probably be the last one for me. SPOILER: Damien is gay. ...more *****You can read the full review at Darling & Co. ***** The exciting sequel to Marked ! This one is exciting for a few reasons.

In this book, the series really starts moving and setting everything up for later books. Also, in this book, a few of the things I know happened from my first time reading happened, so it's nice getting some clarity on my vague memories. *****You can read the full review at Darling & Co. ***** The exciting sequel to Marked !

Also, in this book, a few of the things I know happened from my first time reading happened, so it's nice getting some clarity on my vague memories. I'm still really glad that I'm re-reading this series. So like I said, this one has a little bit more going on in it, which makes sense; you expect that each book has a little more drama as you become more familiar with the world it takes place in and more characters are introduced. The big things in this one are: Zoey's love rectangle (since it's 3 guys, not two); Zoey and Aphrodite; the gang and their affinities; Neferet; and Stevie Rae. All I remember from the next book is that everything intensifies even more, and I think I remember a character that is introduced, but other than that, I don't know what I'm getting into, and I'm excited to find out. ...more I wanted to enjoy this book, because it was obviously a lot better than the first one, but heavy foreshadowing constantly ruined my reading experience. It made the characters seem extremely stupid - half the time I was like, the author's cramming information and hints down your throats and you're still completely clueless? Jeez. Also, if I recall correctly, Zoey used to call Aphrodite & CO sluts in the first novel. In this book, Zoey is involved with no less than THREE guys. At once.

Also, if I recall correctly, Zoey used to call Aphrodite & CO sluts in the first novel. In this book, Zoey is involved with no less than THREE guys. At once. Talk about hypocrisy. I'm also not a fan of the writing style. I can't grasp it why an author who's trying to create a tense atmosphere would write something like this: \" The sides of the walls looked like they had been gouged out by very drunk Tolkien dwarfs (again, I am aware that I'm a dork). \" Why?! And I still can't get over the fact that Zoey Redbird's f-ing one hundred per cent perfect. At least the other characters started showing some more personality than just simple stereotypical character traits. So I am indeed willing to read the next volume, because I simply want to know what'll happen next. ...more Still trying to figure out what's so good about a girl who can't say 'shit' but can call someone Slut and hag with the blink of an eye, for having sex with her own boy friend (or ex-boyfriend).

I actually think of the authors as brave for having straying so much from the vampire norms. Zoey Redbird, is still likable for me. She always has the best interests of everyone is heart. But that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t fail trying. Despite being advanced for a fledgling, she\u2019s still struggling to maintain normalcy. She just wants to fit in. And experience the same stuff other normal teenagers do. Probably having a little boylet, here and there. Despite her having three love interests, I don\u2019t take it against her. I even wish I had three boylets hunkering over me. But dah, I\u2019m no Zoey Redbird. Anyway, this book makes me want to pick up the next one, as in now. I\u2019ve betrayed myself. I swore it couldn\u2019t pick my fancy, but now, karma\u2019s eating at me. ...more \"You deserve to be shown respect,\" Damien said in his school-teacher voice. \"You're the only third former ever to have been made leader of the Dark Daughters and the only fledgling or vampyre in history who has shown an affinity for all five of the elements.\" \"Face it, Z,\" Shaunee said around a bite of salad while she gestured at me with her fork. \"You're special.\" Erin finished for her (as usual). I am going to go ahead and admit something right now: I didn't go into Betrayed with high expectation \"You deserve to be shown respect,\" Damien said in his school-teacher voice. \"You're the only third former ever to have been made leader of the Dark Daughters and the only fledgling or vampyre in history who has shown an affinity for all five of the elements.\" \"Face it, Z,\" Shaunee said around a bite of salad while she gestured at me with her fork. \"You're special.\" Erin finished for her (as usual). I am going to go ahead and admit something right now: I didn't go into Betrayed with high expectations. After all, I read and reviewed Marked about a month ago. I hadn't forgotten how much it made me cringe; the writing was poor, the plot was barely existent, and the characters were flat, stereotyped and annoying- especially our leading lady, Zoey Montgomery Redbird, who is without a doubt the most infuriating fictional character I have ever come across. Still, I was (and still am) determined to finish what I began. A long time ago I made a resolution to finish every book series I start, so that I may never be told \"Your opinion doesn't count because you didn't read all the books.\" Because I'll be damned if I'm ever told I can't dislike the House of Night series because I didn't \"stick with it.\" And, of course, there's the off chance that somewhere along the line, this series will actually manage to get better. Betrayed took five days for me to read, despite it being only 310 pages long. I had to put it down several times because I just couldn't deal with its incessant douchebaggery. All of the last book's problems had come back for an encore, along with several brand new issues. It was like a poor writing party. The story starts off by furiously recapping the last book like there's no tomorrow. Zoey wangsts about how hard it is to be as special as she is, while her friends gush over how amazing she is. She's the new leader of the \"Dark Daughters\", having deposed Aphrodite of her Alpha Female throne at the end of the last book. Coupling that with her magical \"filled in\" mark, affinity for all five of the elements, and not one but two boys who masturbate to the ground she walks on. Oh woe is Zoey Redbird, High Priestess in training! It takes a while for things to get rolling. We're treated to a nice reminder that Zoey's mom and step-father ( or \"step-loser\", as Zoey so clevely puts it ) are assholes and that she is to be pitied for having such a horrible home life. Only, apparently all fledglings are legally emancipated from their parents upon entering the House of Night, so it's not exactly an issue, is it? Plus, Zoey has her loving grandmother who more than makes up for her mother, so what is the problem? (view spoiler) [I've also been informed that Zoey's mother is killed at some point in the series, so there's really no point at all, is there? (hide spoiler) ] Zoey's (main) boyfriend Erik is absent for about 70% of the novel (only showing up to read some poetry, comfort Zoey, and be totally fine with her emotional/physical cheating on him with Heath). To fill his absence, Zoey is given a new admirer in the form of a teacher named Loren. This is about as creepy as you'd expect; there is a lot of \"sexual tension\" (or, what I suppose was meant to be received as sexual tension) that mostly revolves around Loren inappropriately touching Zoey's face/shoulders, and writing \"romantic haikus \" for her. As someone who is dating a student teacher, he and I can both tell you right now that Loren comes off as the biggest creeper. I know the relationship is clearly meant to appeal to fans of \"taboo\" relationships- but it's not sexy. It's awkward and cringe-inducing and only makes me dislike Zoey more. This isn't mentioning Heath, who makes a reappearance by taking advantage of Zoey's addiction for blood by carrying a flipping knife around with him on the off chance he would run into her so, if he did run into her he could promptly SLICE HIMSELF OPEN and let her drink from him. There's a particularly embarrassing scene where they have a \"moment\" in Zoey's car where she drinks his blood and rubs his crotch while he desperately thrusts his hips back against her hand. I had to laugh to keep from physically wincing at the awkward. Zoey constantly moans about how hard it is to juggle three guys. Stevie-Rae at some point says that it's okay for Zoey to cheat because she's so special ; how could the same rules that apply to other people apply to Zoey? I couldn't help but gag at that part. What the fuck? All this boyfriend drama makes up for about thirty or forty percent of the plot. While Zoey is out \"slutting it up\" ( all the while slut-shaming Aphrodite for being with Erik in the last book. Hypocrisy much? ) two male teenagers from her high-school have gone missing, and evidence points to the culprit being someone from the House of Night. This results in some inept detectives showing up for about eight pages to accuse Zoey of being the murderer, leaving, and then coming back at the end of the book to tie the plot together in a flim-flam sort of way. Oh, and Zoey calls the FBI to leave a fake bomb-threat. RESPONSIBLE PROTAGONIST! The other two plot things include Zoey preparing for her first ritual as leader of the Dark Daughters, and setting Neferet up to be the bad guy by having Zoey discover her sneaking around with the supposedly \"dead\" fledglings. Yeah. Riveting book. Yawn. Oh wait, one thing happens. Stevie-Rae dies... for like fifteen pages (all of which Zoey spends wangsting, despite only having known Stevie-Rae for about a month. Wut?). Then she's back, as one of the \"undead\" fledglings. To be honest, the most exciting thing of the book was seeing the \"ugly\" fledgling Elliot from the last book, and he was yet again called \"gross\" and \"hideous\" because he's not gorgeous like the rest of the cast. I have a feeling the Casts have something against ugly people? As I said before, all the problems from the last book are still hanging around. Bad syntax and grammar, poor pacing, racism, sexism, awful characters and immature writing. Zoey enjoys saying things like \"scared poo-less\" or \"I almost peed myself!\" I understand wanting to tone the language down, but Shaunee says fuck at one point- so what's the point of avoiding the word \"shit\"? I could understand avoiding the \"three big swears\" (view spoiler) [Cunt, Nigger and Faggot, if you're curious (although, faggot was used in Marked now that I think about it...) (hide spoiler) ] but if you're saying fuck, you can say shit. Common sense. Have some. Not to mention that any time Shaunee shows up, everything stops to remind us that she's black. Oh, but don't say the word \"black!\" Call her \"mocha\" coloured, or \"cafe-latte\", or some other coffee flavor instead! This happened on the first damn page. There's also more of this crap later on in the book where a dude flirts with Shaunee saying that he's \"colorful\" which made me drop the book and push it away. Why? Then there's Damien. Can we leave the poor gay kid alone? Why does every time he show up we have to be reminded that he loves the D? There's a part in the book where the other girls taunt him and call him \"Majesty\" and \"Your Highness\", and it's not treated as bullying . I understand that friends tease friends, but this was awful. I have a gay friend who would punch you in the face for that kind of dickery. This book added the character \"Jack Twist\", who is immediately revealed to be gay without any characterization because he's named after a character from Brokeback Mountain. Casts, you're not clever. We all know that you added this flat, faceless gay character so Damien could be paired up like the rest of the characters are being paired up, and you're not doing it well . All of this added together for one mess of a book. I don't have any fond moments to recall. I don't think I enjoyed any part of this except when I read it aloud to my boyfriend to laugh about how much of a fail we thought it was. Basically, I did not like this book. Again, I would like to end this review by saying it's perfectly alright for other people to like this book. And yes, good on the Casts for doing something with their lives and writing a series of books- but these books have serious problems . The messages they send are really hurtful and... bad . If I could sum them up, it'd be \"judge others; be childish and disrespectful; get butthurt when people don't show you respect; lie, lie and lie some more- friends don't deserve the truth!\" and several others. This book is not a good book. It was annoying and bad and creepy and bad . I'm honestly doubting that any of these books will be any good. Regardless, I'm going to keep reading them and see it through to the end like I swore I would, because even if they aren't great literature, they're still really hilarious to snark at with my friends. ...more Wow...

There is still plenty of confusion in store for Zoey though, as she deals with her feelings for her human ex-boyfriend who she has accidentally Imprinted, while she has her new vampyre fledgling bf Erik who is more of a mate for her. He suits her better. I really love ths characters and their relationships with each other. Zoey's group of friends are amazing and are friends to hope for.

I'm officially a fan of this series and will countdown the days for each new edition! Synopsis: Summary (from the book jacket) Fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbird has managed to settle in at the House of Night finishing school. She finally feels like she belongs, even gets chosen as the Leader of the Dark Daughters. Best of all, she actually has a boyfriend\u2026 or two. Then the unthinkable happens: Human teenagers are being killed, and all the evidence points to the House of Night. While danger stalks the humans from Zoey\u2019s old life, she begins to realize that the very powers that make her so unique might also threaten those she loves. Then when she needs her new friends the most, death strikes the House of Night, and Zoey must find the courage to face a betrayal that could break her heart, her soul, and jeopardize the very fabric of her world. ...more What I liked: -Aphrodite. Again, she was my favorite character in the book, and I found the way the rest of the characters treated her disgusting. Aphrodite\u2019s the only character I had sympathy for throughout the entire first two books, and she will probably stay the only character I have sympathy for. She\u2019s the only real character. She speaks her mind, she makes others listen to her, and she has a gift that could be considered a terrible burden, one that she has to deal with by herself. -Grandma R What I liked: -Aphrodite. Again, she was my favorite character in the book, and I found the way the rest of the characters treated her disgusting. Aphrodite\u2019s the only character I had sympathy for throughout the entire first two books, and she will probably stay the only character I have sympathy for. She\u2019s the only real character. She speaks her mind, she makes others listen to her, and she has a gift that could be considered a terrible burden, one that she has to deal with by herself. -Grandma Redbird. She was the only adult in Zoey\u2019s life that I actually liked. The Native America history is one of the only redeeming qualities of these books, and I\u2019m glad that they seem to be sticking true to Grandma Redbird\u2019s heritage. She was clever and patient and resourceful. What I disliked: -Zoey. Again, she is just terrible. We are constantly reminded at how amazing and special and important Zoey is, yet she never does anything amazing, special, or important. She just bosses her friends around, obsesses over boys, and judges everyone within her vicinity. I\u2019m not sure I can handle being trapped in her shallow thoughts much longer. -Supporting cast. I didn\u2019t think it was possible for them to get more annoying than they were in book one, but they did. With the addition of Jack, who is like every single gay clich\u00e9 rolled up into one, I just couldn\u2019t handle their collective stupidity. They\u2019re a bunch of childish, judgmental, idiots, and they all deserve Zoey. -Zoey\u2019s mom and step-dad. It felt like PC Cast was just trying to make them the most horrible parents ever. Yes, he\u2019s controlling. Yes, her mother is weak-willed, but seriously. The author went a bit overboard with the whole angst-filled \u201cI hate my parents because you don\u2019t love me\u201d thing. Same with Aphrodite and her parents. I\u2019ve been in a similar position to Zoey and Aphrodite before, and let me tell you, it is nothing like PC Cast is making it out to be. Nothing. -Love interests. There are about to be three of them. The addition of Loren Blake is just terrible. I absolutely despise Heath as well. At one point, he sits in Zoey\u2019s car and even though she protests and tells him no, he cuts himself, even knowing it will force her to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do, like drink his blood. Heath just does not get the hint, even though Zoey tells him they\u2019re over several times. It\u2019s not cute that he\u2019s insistent like that, it\u2019s creepy, and it should be portrayed as such. Erik is the only boyfriend I like. At one point, Zoey thinks to herself You don't deserve him... and she's right. Erik deserves much bette than a bratty, unfaithful girlfriend. -Terrible foreshadowing. Seriously, they start talking about the possibility of one of them not surviving the Change, and then one paragraph later Zoey is mentioning how pale Stevie Rae looks, and how she has a bad cough. Yeah, I totally didn\u2019t see her death coming. At all. PC Cast didn\u2019t even try with that one. Overall, this book was terrible. I\u2019d give it less than one star if I could. And I really don\u2019t feel like reading the rest of them, but since I owned them up to number four and I\u2019ve never not finished a series before, I\u2019ll probably keep reading. Since starting these reviews, I\u2019m up to Destined already, so I may as well keep going. 1.0 ...more I like Betrayed a bit more than Marked . I thought the story was more interesting and complex, and (some of) the characters have been fleshed out more. It still has all the things I like from the first one as well. I enjoyed the main conflict in the book, though the villains were a bit over the top. It was more interesting to me than coming in and taking down the evil queen of the school within the first two days of being there.

I am glad that certain characters (Aphrodite & Neferet, especially) have become more complex than the cardboard cutouts everyone acted like in the first book. I like that we see not even the main characters are safe, though the fact that Stevie Rae is not exactly dead has me wondering if they are going to miraculous find a cure and she will be restored to her fledgling form? I hope not, though I liked her character. All the repetitive information recapping the first book was quite annoying. This, along with various other things I do not like, makes the writing feel forced and awkward. I think it's an interesting premise overall, but it just seems like they are trying too hard to create this cool, hip, original vampire world. Still do not like all the pop culture references, making all these celebrities into vampires, and defining words for us. Also do not like the authors' need to explain why the main character knows certain pop culture references or that liking certain things makes her a dork. And I do not like that the authors' feel the need to explain the characters to us, how gay Damien is or how country Stevie Rae is. Stop shoving them into stereotypes and just let them be! Still annoyed that Zoey is the most amazingest vampire fledgling eva!!! And that she gets not one, but three of the hottest guys around interested in her. I know fiction can be used to fulfill fantasies that could never happen in real life, but come on now. Also, Zoey is supposed to be wise and mature and a great leader, but she is still sounding very immature. I'm still annoyed by how casually she runs around calling people losers for how they look, what they wear, and choices they make that she doesn't like. She has good ideas and makes a lot of smart choices, but the way she reacts to what she is deciding against makes her seem less mature. So, lots of annoying things still! But they were there to a lesser degree than the first book, and the story was more interesting. I'm looking forward to the next one. ...more", "Title": "Betrayed"},
