All I have to say is THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD . Also, if you're on the fence about whether or not to continue reading this book, don't read this review unless you're set on quitting . Okay? Okay. Onwards to the actual review! ************* I just couldn't finish it. And I tried. Really, really tried. Even after studying Chinese history extensively in college, I'm usually not very picky about the books that I read. I don't really care about the accuracy or the sequence of events, as long as it's a good story. But maybe it's the cheesy title. Or maybe it's just too girly. Or maybe,<---M> just maybe</---M>, the fact that this foolish girl starved herself to death because of lovesickness was the last kick in the butt my usually sleepy (<---B>yet very existent</---B>) inner feminist could endure before waking and wanting to punch someone. I have enough idiots in my life to deal with. Please don't make me deal with more in my head. Granted, the book does somewhat cleverly depict the Chinese afterlife, but the rest was so blah and a little insulting to my intelligence and femininity. If I rolled my eyes any harder while reading this book, I would have fallen out of my chair. I may return to skim through the pages again to finish but probably not anytime soon. ...more \u201c\"When people are alive they love, when they die, they keep loving.

The paperback (the brand new one still wrapped in cellophane) was on sale and I bought it for a very fairly cheap price. Guess how much. (view spoiler) [ One U.S. dollar, can you believe that!!?? (hide spoiler) ] I was elated to discover that this is a historical novel as I made a recent promise to myself to increase my historical fiction reads. I dove right into the book and read every page as fast as I possibly could despite the challenge of going through realistic historical events set in 17th century China that kept threatening to put me to sleep. Luckily, I upped my dose of caffeine, so I was able to finish the book in less than two days. Yay! This is mainly a love story or rather a story of love-sickness and in the point of view of a practical, modern woman, it would be the most foolish thing to starve yourself because of love and yes I am one of those women. Had it ended in that tragic death, I would say it would be just an overused lovesick tragic tale. But it didn\u2019t end there! The latter half of the story which I found very hauntingly fantastic presents the MC\u2019s journey in the afterlife as her love for her one and only man transcends even death. But far better than the story itself, I felt a greater pull toward the imaginative, vivid, and evocative writing of the author and the way she perfectly depicted ancient Chinese cultures and rituals on courtship, marriage and death and I found myself captivated. Even though, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the story, I highly commend <---A>Lisa See</---A> for the brilliant artist that she is by writing this priceless artifact of a novel. ...more

Love p This book is amazing!!! It is beautifully written (lovely descriptions and intricate details), well researched, and unbelievably touching. There were moments where I feel I can't read anymore because I am so overwhelmed with emotion, but I can never put the book down for any real length of time. I have become completely engrossed. The summary of the book is a little misleading. It describes the book as a love story. I do not find it to be one. <+++>Peony in Love</+++> is a romantic and tragic story. Love plays a big part, but not necessarily in the way I expected it to. More important in this book are the facts. 1)The traditions and beliefs practiced in the book were actually the beliefs and practices of the time, and some are really bizarre to me! 2)A woman's place in the society of that age. It's fascinating to see the differences from then to now, and also to realize that while there are differences, there are also many similarities today in women's oppression and sensoring as there were then. 3)The women in the story were real women, as was Wu Ren. Their comments on the play The Peony Pavilion are real and were compiled into a book: Wu Wushan\u2019s Three Wives\u2019 Collaborative Commentary of The Peony Pavilion. I don't want to give too much away. Please read it for yourself. One way or another you will be touched. It is a truly amazing read! ...more Set in 17th-century China, See\u2019s fifth novel is a coming-of-age story, a ghost story, a family saga and a work of musical and social history.

As Peony, the 15-year-old daughter of the wealthy Chen family, approaches an arranged marriage, she commits an unthinkable breach of etiquette when she accidentally comes upon a man who has entered the family garden. Unusually for a girl of her time, Peony has been educated and revels in studying The Peony Pavilion, a real opera published in 1598, as the repercussions of the meeting unfold. The novel\u2019s plot mirrors that of the opera, and eternal themes abound: an intelligent girl chafing against the restrictions of expected behavior; fiction\u2019s educative powers; the rocky path of love between lovers and in families. It figures into the plot that generations of young Chinese women, known as the lovesick maidens, became obsessed with The Peony Pavilion, and, in a Werther-like passion, many starved themselves to death. See (Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, etc.) offers meticulous depiction of women\u2019s roles in Qing and Ming dynasty China (including horrifying foot-binding scenes) and vivid descriptions of daily Qing life, festivals and rituals. Peony\u2019s vibrant voice, perfectly pitched between the novel\u2019s historical and passionate depths, carries her story beautifully\u2014in life and afterlife.) I must say that I loved the first Lisa See novel that I read (Snow Flower and the Secret Fan) and had high hopes for this one, and was severely disappointed. It just rambled on and on (SPOILER) even after the main character dies. Uggh. After the beautiful writing of \u201cSnow Flower\u201d, it was hard to read this\u2013 it was simply missing too much - in terms of explanations, background details, character development, and tying together really choppy scenes, that it felt amateurish, trite and unmoving. ...more \u0628\u0639\u062f\u064e \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u060c \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0623\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0623\u0634\u0631\u062d \u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0623\u0635\u064a\u063a \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0629 .. \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 ! \u0645\u0646\u062d\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062e\u0645\u0633 \u0646\u062c\u0645\u0627\u062a ..

Peony's father hosts a production of the opera (which Peony assumes is for her, rather than to impress the powerful men that her father has visiting), and Peony meets a young man three nights in a row. She falls in love with him, but at the end of the third night they know they both must go on to their arranged marriages and will most likely never see each other again. Peony becomes obsessed with the opera, and stops eating almost completely in her want to write a complete commentary on it. Anything more will spoil significant parts of the plot, but I'll say that it heavily involves ghosts and the Chinese afterworld. It's really a fascinating read, both to get an idea of the \"lovesick girls\" (who actually did exist--girls who wasted away, pining for love after reading The Peony Pavilion ) and to get a better understanding of old Chinese ghosts and death rituals. It's a little fantastical at times, but it definitely not so much that it overtakes the core of the novel: a woman's craving to be heard. Definitely nothing like her previous novel, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan , but I think that's what made it so great. It gives a good understanding of other aspects of Chinese culture, in a time where women were trying to have their creative voices heard rather than continuing their quiet existence in their family's inner chambers.

But then she died, and it got so much better. I had rather eagerly anticipated this novel, because i had loved Lisa See's last, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan . Set shortly after the fall of the Ming Dynasty in seventeenth century China and based on real historic characters and works of literature, Peony in Love is an involving tale of an often unknown period of women writers. Soon to celebrate her sixteenth birthday (on the the rather auspicious Double Seven~the seventh day of the seventh month~for which her father has commissioned a very special performance of the opera The Peony Pavilion, her very favorite~and scandalously enough women will be allowed to watch, though from behind a screen.) Peony is also about to embark on young womanhood, is betrothed to a man she has not met (as Chinese tradition of the day dictated) and will soon be marrying out. On the first night of the three-night opera she leaves to take some air and meets a young poet who reminds her of the hero of the opera. It is, but of course, love at first sight. Peony is destined to pine away for her young poet and die of love-sickness before she can be married as have so many young girls before her~victims just like the heroine the idolize in the The Peony Pavilion. It is only after death that Peony can begin to see the world and her family for what they really are, even though these perceptions go through a couple of changes even then. She continues her growth process even after death. After death she learns of the relationships her family members had with each other, as well as changing her views about the relationships she had with them. She develops a relationship with the grandmother she has always worshiped and respected as an ancestor and learns to see her as a real woman. Peony grows into a woman who makes mistakes and longs to be heard (a problem of many women as they moved from the slightly more liberal Ming dynasty to the more repressive Manchus, even more so for Peony facing the challenges of being a ghost), she also grows to truly love her husband in death and learns to recognize the difference between that and what she felt as a young girl. Though many of the elements of this tale i could see coming i still enjoyed the process of reading about them (and isn't that what it's all about anyway~and there really aren't any new tales to tell~isn't that part of the point?) See does a beautiful job of depicting the turmoil of the teenage heart, as well as the problems faced with growing older and facing our mistakes, though she did it in a novel way. She also illuminated a Chinese belief system that i knew nothing about. I deeply enjoyed this novel and gained an even greater appreciation for See's artistry. It made me want to learn more about The Three Wives Commentary, the original inspiration for this novel, which was the \"first book of its kind to been published anywhere in the world to have been written by women\" (the three consecutive wives of Wu Ren) as well as bringing back memories of the wonderful but haunting Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts by the incomparable Maxine Hong Kingston. ...more \u0641\u062c\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u0628\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629. \u0643\u0645 \u0647\u0648 \u0642\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u0648\u0643\u0645 \u0623\u062c\u0631\u0645\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0642\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0631. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u064a\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645 \u0639\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0627 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0631\u0643\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0632\u0648\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0628\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0627\u061f!

As soon as it was done, I ran out and bought the book. I just *needed* to view the words that I had heard on the audiobook. As soon as I finished reading the last page, I turned to page 1 and started over again. This is the first and only time that I have ever done that. This is one of my all time favorite books, and I keep a copy beside my bed, so it is never far from my mind... 'My eyes were shaped like bamboo leaves; my brows were like gentle brushstrokes limned by a calligrapher'. The notion that 17th century Chinese characters would speak like this for the benefit of 21st century English-speaking readers is preposterous to say the least. It is obvious that the author has conducted extensive research on the history and culture of late Ming/ early Qing dynasty Hangzhou, and the fruits of that research abound in this historical-supernatural novel. However, the anthropol 'My eyes were shaped like bamboo leaves; my brows were like gentle brushstrokes limned by a calligrapher'. The notion that 17th century Chinese characters would speak like this for the benefit of 21st century English-speaking readers is preposterous to say the least. It is obvious that the author has conducted extensive research on the history and culture of late Ming/ early Qing dynasty Hangzhou, and the fruits of that research abound in this historical-supernatural novel. However, the anthropological details, more often than not, tend to choke the life out of the characters and sometimes even the narrative itself. The historical fact behind the story itself is interesting, namely that the cultural renaissance that took place in late Ming dynasty Hangzhou gave aristocratic Chinese women unprecedented access to education, and even enabled them to actively participate in the literary scene. Three of these women, all the wives of Wu Ren, wrote The Three Wives Commentary on the Peony Pavillion, apparently the 'first book of its kind to have been published anywhere in the world to have been written by women', according to the author. However, instead of telling us the story of how these women managed to write such a work, the author chose to wallow in questionable exoticism and new-agey philosophizing. The emphasis on exoticism, some of which seem to be contrived for the benefit of Western audiences, reduces the complexity and richness of Chinese culture into a set of cruel customs and absurd superstitions. SPOILERS Peony is an insipid 16-year old girl who wilfully starves herself to death after she was betrothed to a stranger, who later turns out to be her paramour, Wu Ren. For some undecipherable reason (morbidity?, stupidity?), she never bothers to inquire about the identity of her fiancee until it is too late. Due to some sort of a shenanigan involving her ancestral tablet, she is condemned to spend her time wandering the afterlife as a hungry ghost. This exploration of the Chinese afterlife is interesting for a while, but it quickly degenerates into a mushy ghost story when Peony decides to stalk her former fiancee. With her ghostly powers, she interferes in his life, including choosing and grooming a three-year old girl for his future wife. The ick factor multiplies when we learn that she also participates (in her ghostly way) in the couple's bedroom activities. Finally, after further trials and tribulations, she is released from her status as a hungry ghost to join her revered ancestors in heaven. Two stars for the story and writing, an extra star for the research. ...more I really enjoyed reading Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. Peony in Love has a few of the same elements but is, nicely, a different novel. Peony is the only child of a wealthy couple who experienced some hard times during the Manchu raids.

Peony, encouraged by her father, loves to read. She reads extensively but her favorite work is the Peony Pavilion--an opera. Her father stages the opera at her home and the women are allowed to watch through a screen. Peony meets a boy, falls in love, and begins to follow some of the same experiences as the main character in the opera. Convinced that she'll be marrying someone other than the boy she met, she succumbs to \"lovesickness\" and slowly starves herself to death. Mix-ups happen and Peony's spirit isn't able to move on since her tablet hasn't been dotted yet. A good portion of the novel is her experiences as her ghost waits to be able to move on in the afterlife. I enjoyed the novel. I don't know a lot of the Chinese beliefs and other traditions, just bits here and there. It was fascinating learning a bit of what the Chinese afterlife would have been like. On dying, Peony's spirit splits into three pieces, one of which is to go into her tablet to stay with her family. As her tablet hasn't been dotted, Peony becomes a 'Hungry ghost.\" Fascinating. Another cultural thing I found of interest was the lovesick maidens. While they are mentioned in the story, the comments at the end of the novel by Lisa See brought their stories more to mind. See mentions that in Chinese history, there were a number of girls who, like in the opera and Peony, become lovesick and starve themselves. The idea is introduced through the opera with the idea that the women would gain freedom and control over their lives in the afterlife and choose thier own husbands. This idea of power over oneself is so appealing that many women practiced physical control over their bodies by becoming anorexic to the point of death, possibly hoping for the chance for a choice in love in the afterlife. ...more Lisa See's writing is beautiful, and I understand this book is supposed to be about the women of China who wanted their voices to be heard. But what I found really fascinating about it was the descriptions of Chinese rituals and superstitions, and learning what the Chinese thought about death. The descriptions were so vivid to me that I felt like I could really see the pavilions, the plum tree, the Viewing Terrace. There were so many sentences that made me reflect about life in general. \"My hear Lisa See's writing is beautiful, and I understand this book is supposed to be about the women of China who wanted their voices to be heard.

From the reviews that I have read since finishing you either love this book or hate it. Something no one mentioned but which I believe, is that in 17th century China there was a rash of cases of anorexia but they called it love sickness, occurring primarily in adolescents girls, and to me understandable because of the lack of any control over the destiny of your life. I loved this book, it moved at a slow pace but spanned many years and at least half of the book is told by a ghost but revealing so many cultural beliefs of the Chinese at that time. I am hopeful that the culture presented is accurate because nothing upsets me more than to later discover very little of what was presented was fabricated. ...more Young Peony was brought up to be a good daughter and wife.

Originally, when I read the blurb of this book, I thought it had an incredibly interesting concept and was rather excited to read a novel that was so rich in Chinese culture and tradition, since I would be rather ignorant in these matters. So naturally, I really wanted to like this book. It's quite unfortunate that the book had very few redeeming qualities. The character of Peony, I felt, was one that was very difficult to sympathise with. Her naivety, innocence and idealism can be dismissed as a result of her young age for a certain part of the novel but since it persists for the whole duration of it, it's easy to conclude that these things are deeply-entrenched character traits rather than anything else. There is growth in Peony's character during the novel, noticeable growth but none of that makes me like her more as a character. The writing itself is simplistic, which works for the book for the most part. However, a lot of the descriptions felt jarring and contrived, as if the author was purposely trying to be too poetic - to the point where the prose was actually slightly amusing as opposed to solemn or sincere. However, the plot itself was probably the biggest problem of the novel for me. Reading the Afterword of the book, Lisa See seems to believe that she has managed to capture some form of female historical resistance or empowerment through this piece of literature and whilst there are certain aspects of that, they are quickly overridden by a largely misogynistic narrative. I understand that See was attempting to tell the true story of these women but she admits to the lack of knowledge about the three wives of the Wu family. It seems that See invented much of what happened in the latter half of the book - the supernatural elements of it. So it is disappointing and slightly sickening actually, the sheer amount of disrespect given to women in the plot during this latter half. I felt this especially through the portrayal of Ze's character. She's made out to be a villain for the majority of the book, whilst we're supposed to be sympathise with the main character of Peony, despite the fact that Peony robbed Ze of her agency and her body. Whilst there were certain narratives within the overarching story that I enjoyed; such as the excursions of Peony's mother and grandmother (overridden by the Manchus invasion - I felt it eventually told a story about a woman's place being at home and punished the two characters for their attempt to traverse outside of their gender roles) and the Banana Garden Five, the overall story, although boasted of female empowerment and feminist ideologies, entirely failed in its promises. ...more Lisa See's research comes out in almost every passage of this historical novel of the first Manchu dynasty in China.

Because my daughter is learning about China, I gravitated towards this novel in eagerness to learn more about the power, or lack of power, that women have had in China throughout the centuries. See follows the plot of a famous Chinese opera, The Peony Pavilion, by having her young maiden be so swept away with emotion and desire that she stops eating and loses her chance at earthly happiness. Veering from the plot of the opera, she then shows how her maiden gains wisdom from the trials placed into her afterlife and eventually finds her voice by working with her earthly sister-wives. If you don't have patience for speculation about the afterlife, don't bother picking this novel up since other reviewers have described it as being too \"metaphysical\" for their taste. And if you're all about the consummation of young love, this won't be your cup of tea either. Rather, this novel seems to be a meditation on the many different kinds of love that come into our lives. Being a lovesick maiden is well and good, but hanging around to experience the love of parenting, of mature love with a partner, of a mature relationship with your own parent, definitely has its own rewards, probably way greater than which we see between Romeo and Juliet, to mix my historical locations and stories. The hidden reward for me was to discover that Imperial China had its published female writers and women of accomplishment. It was a short time in China's history, but how awesome to discover that even in repressive China, women had found a way to be heard and to show what their lives were like. This is an inspiration, and gives me an opening in conversations about the power of women when I talk with my daughters. ...more An interesting story, with a clever structure, weaving parallels between the legend of the Peony Pavilion with the \"real\" story of a girl called Peony, though that does make the first third very predictable.

Whilst I found all that interesting, I think it could have been presented more su An interesting story, with a clever structure, weaving parallels between the legend of the Peony Pavilion with the \"real\" story of a girl called Peony, though that does make the first third very predictable. I found the faux naive voice of Peony a little irritating at times; it is too didactic in the way it fills readers in on the historical detail of customs and beliefs, being more like a factual book than a novel. Whilst I found all that interesting, I think it could have been presented more subtly (or else with footnotes). Still, it was interesting to consider that footbinding could actually be an act or rebellion and even freedom for poorer girls (as in Snow Flower too). For much of the book I was concerned that the message was that reading is a dangerous activity for women, though that is finally overturned \u2013 sort of. There were incongruous bits that sounded too modern and that a good editor should have picked up on as they were needlessly distracting: some of the descriptions of the empowering of women; lovesickness often sounded too much like a modern analysis of anorexia - explicitly when Ze says \"I stopped eating, and for once I had total control over my destiny\", and the ghastly line stolen from a budget sci fi movie \"We asked the netherworld bureaucrats and received one time return-to-earth permits\". I also found the \"clouds and rain\" threesome/intimacy by proxy, a rather disquieting concept. Although I realise it was meant to be a beautiful coming together, it rather tainted the rest of the story for me. So overall, interesting, but for me, a frustrating and disappointing read, albeit quite educational. It only gets as many as 3 stars because I like reading things that evoke China. ...more I liked this book the same way I liked The Other Boleyn Girl .

MAN, it is SO COOL. If I'm going to get critical, there are just a couple of things. Two major plot points that I got the feeling were supposed to be surprises were highly predictable. I in fact called them as soon as the issue presented itself. The ending is a little anticlimactic. And the title was sort of cheesy and didn't quite fit. After reading the afterword I realize that the protagonist's name didn't HAVE to be Peony, and is it really necessary that there be two novels set in Chinese dynasties titled after a protagonist named Peony ? But really, I cannot complain after such a highly enjoyable experience. Man, I am such a GIRL. ...more I almost didn't finish this book, but I'm glad I did. It's uneven quality accounts for the rating. Considering the ending, which redeems so much which seemed sensational, tawdry and even dangerous and the fact that it is based on a true story, I was inclined to be generous.

On the first night, Peony, leaves the opera in the middle just to contemplate life. She goes to a garden pavilion and while she is standing there a the same young man she saw walks into the pavilion. The two are not supposed to be alone with one another. They talk for a minute and they leave. They agree to meet there the next night. Peony has fallen in love. She meets him there the next night and he says he loves her. They barely touch and then they decide to meet the next night at a pavilion near the lake where nobody will find them. The next night she goes out there and he wants to show her his house. They wade into the lake a little bit and he lives points out this house. He proclaims his love for her and says that was the best 3 days and he will never forget them. They go back and her mom finds out that she did something wrong because her dress is muddy. As they are getting ready to leave, her dad in the other room with the guys, points out her future husband. She doesn't look because she is too in love with the other guy. Her mom takes her upstairs to her room and locks her in. Soon Peony gets sick because she is lovesick and can't eat. She starts to write all these poems and such. Her mom is upset with her and trys to teach her for her wedding but she still won't let her out. As her wedding date nears, she gets sicker and sicker. She just wants to be with the man she really loves. Her dad comes home to see her off to her wedding and he gives her something her future husband gave him at the opera. It is a dryed flower. The same dryed flower Peony gave the man she loves. All of the sudden she realizes the man she loves is her husband. She is so happy. She begins to eat, but it is too late. Her mom and aunts prepare her for what she thought was her wedding, but in actuality they are preparing for her death. On her wedding day, they stick her out in the cold, winter weather and let her die. That was the custom. Right then, I couldn't read anymore. I cried for 10 minutes. I can hardly even write this review. I was so upset. I can't explain why. I hate her parents for killing her. She was so happy and then they killed her. She was going to have everything she wanted and then they killed her. They just set her and all her stuff out in the cold and let her die. They don't even care. They burned all her books and writings because it wasn't ladylike. They punished her for having a little bit of fun on her birthday. She was a prisoner and eventually died like that too. I hated this book. ...more Different This story was about a lot of things. The overall theme being an attempt to celebrate the brilliance of women in a male dominated society.

They are on various levels treated as pleasure makers, baby making machines and nurses to rear the boys into men who will carry on the family name and traditions and subdue girls into proper prospects that can be sold at a good bride price to a new family to hopefully bring them sons. This story is really about how women who this culture says should be ruled by men and not think and act for themselves break through the chains that bind them in life and even into death. This story encompasses The Seven Emotions: joy, anger, grief, fear, love hate and desire. The story itself is a different one. In my opinion even brimming on strange. I don't really do stories that have the age old Dante's Inferno feel. I don't really like reading stories where characters take journeys into an afterlife of the authors creation. I don't read books about ghosts. So I was very torn with this one. On the one hand I felt it was very imaginative for the author to use this in her story the way she did. It took a lot of study and imagination, I'm sure. On the other hand because this makes me personally uncomfortable I was in a hurry to finish reading this as quick as I could. Also, there was a book or a play that the characters made endless reference to and some characters seemed to mirror their life upon that just drove me bats. When I started this book I fell asleep three times (probably more) every time I tried to read through the lines of this book/play. It was so extremely boring that I really almost put the book down but then resolved to just skim the lines for what I needed or skip over them entirely to get through the book. Which is sad. How annoying that I had to spend an entire book skimming and rushing. The story within was artful. The message about women was good. How the seven emotions were applied throughout the plot and conflict was skillful. But...I just was not enamored with this. I give it 3 stars. Per the reviews a lot of people liked this. I recommend reading the synopsis, a few reviews and an excerpt. ...more Peony In Love By Lisa See pages : 284 Do you believe in fate? I do. I believe I am fated to be with my husband.

Peony was the only daughter of Chen family. Her marriage was arranged since she was young like other girls' marriages. Peony accepted her fate to marry a stranger, however she changed her attitude after she met a young man who captured her heart, Wu Ren, the poet. The meeting happened when she was attending The Peony Pavilion opera. Peony did not know that the man she met was her future husband. Peony's life changed after that meeting and after watching the opera. She was obsessed with the opera story and Wu Ren. She then refused to eat and drink. Her mother tried many ways to make her healthy again but it was too late. Peony was weak and was almost dying when her father revealed the truth about her future husband. Peony in love was also about life after death. Peony tried to help her future husband by possessing his other wife which resulted in the death of the wife. I was amazed that this story had many points. As I mentioned above Peony in love was about fate, was about life after death and it was also about the women writers. Peony write her commentary on Peony pavilion when she was dying. She then tried to make the other wife of Wu Ren to finish it but she died before she had a chance to finish it. Eventually, the commentary was done through the last wife of Wu Ren . The commentary was published under Wu Ren's name but after much hardship, it was published under Wu Ren's three wives. ...more When the novel begins, Peony is a 17th century 15 year old girl in China.
