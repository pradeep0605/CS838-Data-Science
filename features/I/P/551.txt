It certainly will be my favorite book of the year. It is gloriously long and kept me occupied for an entire day (night hours included) making me crave to find out more, but also stop reading so that the book won't end just yet. You think you know Celaena from reading the first two books, right? Oh, but you're so so wrong. In this book we see her more than broken, relentlessly blaming herself for the fates and deaths of her beloved ones. She takes down her every shield, leaving nothing behind to shed her emptiness threatening to shatter her from the inside out. I believe this was her turning point, the true crossroad in her life, making her see, accept and embrace all that pain, regret and self-loathing she carefully kept hidden inside her soul, etched into her dire and gruesome memories. \u201cYou collect scars because you want proof that you are paying for whatever sins you've committed. And I know this because I've been doing the same damn thing for two hundred years. Tell me, do you think you will go to some blessed Afterworld, or do you expect a burning hell? You're hoping for hell--because how could you face them in the Afterworld?\u201d And gods, what memories and past. We are able to witness how she became <---C>Celaena Sardothien</---C>, how her life changed forever on that fateful night ten years ago. But by facing all that sorrow and darkness, she's making a stand. She's slowly becoming a queen, one more powerful and deadlier that you could ever imagine. Her character development is phenomenal, because through her new experiences she is stronger, wiser and more determined. Her fierceness was awe-inspiring and I loved that she's still the same stubborn, snarky and brave young woman, maybe with her ego a little bruised. She's not proud of who she's become, abandoning her kingdom and not fighting for rebuilding it for the past ten years, but she's ready to throw herself into battle to win back her land. To say that she's badass would be an understatement. Celaena makes the transition from assassin to queen with the help of Rowan, a Fae Prince and my favorite new addition to the series. Not that he is so eager to help, but in order to find answers about the Wyrdkeys and how to destroy them, she has to be worthy of entering Doranelle, the land where Queen Maeve awaits her to answer her questions. May I shout something? I LOVE ROWAN WHITETHORN . In the beginning, he's infuriatingly patient and stubborn, brooding and secretive. But when he opens up? And when he actually smiles ?!? Laughs ?? Scrap me off the floor cause I am hyperventilating.<---F> \u201cGods, he was brilliant</---F>. Cunning and wicked and brilliant. Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.\u201d He's an alpha-male in all his glory, with the kickass moves that would bring Celaena's to shame. He's scary and intense, protective and defying, caring, but lethal when it comes to his enemies. Rowan is the no-nonsense type and I was glad there is finally someone who doesn't put up with Celaena's bullshit. She throws a verbal punch? He throws one that will leave her with a black eye for the entire week. But they develop a friendship and something so important on the intimate level (not talking about romance) that it will warm your heart to realize that our girl finally has someone to fully rely on. No secrets, no barriers, no judging left between them. They would die for each other, kill for each other, fight for each other. And when they work together, as a pair, as a team, they're astounding and terrifying. \u201cI claim you, Rowan Whitethorn. I don't care what you say and how much you protest. I claim you as my friend.\u201d Dorian Havilliard is the same swoon-worthy, sentimental, humble (yet a bit arrogant as well) young prince. He will win your heart regardless of the \"team\" you're in, because in the end he stands up to his father in a glorious way that had me cheering for him. He is way more mature, weary of everyone and everything and you can see him becoming a true worthy king right before your eyes. A lot of heartbreak and despair was in store for him and I guarantee it will all leave you in a pile of overwhelming feels. In addition to his wonderful character development, Dorian is moving on from Celaena. And I'm not sure I like who he's moving on with. Heck, I don't like that he's actually moving on. Makes the whole Dorian/Celaena shipping a bit harder. But truth be told now, as much as I was against his new lady Sorscha, I was glad he got a little happiness and support to fight his growing loneliness, worries and magic. And you want to know why? Because freaking Chaol Westfall pretty much abandoned his friend when he needed him the most. Yeah, you read that right. Dedicated, loyal, selfless Chaol was so unable to make up his damn mind that I was uncounsciously pulling my hair. I was very much irritated with him until the very end when he came to his senses. In the aftermath of Crown of Midnight , his friendship with Dorian is left in shambles and things don't get prettier in this book. They grow estranged, but I'll give it to the captain that he has only the prince's safety and freedom in interest. But keeping secrets, judging, not being able to accept Celaena's and Dorian's powers -- all these things make me wonder if he has any shot left at our heroine's heart, because whereas Celaena would always pick him, Aelin would not. \u201cAs for Celaena,\u201d he said again, \u201c you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.\u201d We meet awesome warrior Aedion Ashryver, Celaena's cousin and childhood best friend. He's all deadly smiles, muscles and wild behavior. Aedion is daring, clever and doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself. Or so they say. But he's dead set on taking down the King of Adarlan from the inside. When he finds out Aelin is alive, he makes it clear that he would move mountains in order to see his true queen back in Terrasen. He's loyal, determined, skilled and I hope he reunites with Celaena sooner rather than later, because he is in a pretty bad place at the end of the book. \"A cry went up from the witches, save for the Thirteen\u2014\u00acwho stayed cool and quiet. They did not need to cheer, for they \u00acwere immortal and infinite and gloriously, wonderfully deadly.\u201d Another addition to the newbie characters is Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak coven of the Ironteeth witches and leader of the Thirteen. The witches play a big role in the King's newest and darkest plans by being the riders of the wyverns he has created and Manon wants nothing more than to lead them into battle as Wing Leader. She wants to prove herself and although she is a bloodthirsty, wicked creature, I completely loved her. She's by no means a villain, just a different kind of heroine, firm and unyielding, with great ambition. Her encounters and silent dialogues with Abraxos cracked me up, because in that moments you could glimpse (besides the wyvern's total awesomeness) how Manon starts believing there's a chance she has a heart and soul and that her grandmother's rules might not be the best to follow. \u201cWitches didn't need blood to survive, but humans didn't need wine, either.\u201d The King of Adarlan is still the biggest bastard I've had the (dis)pleasure of reading. I loathe the guy with every fiber of my being. He is wicked to the core, manipulative and selfish to no end. No, not just selfish, but greedy. Greedy for everything and anything, exactly like a monster. And what he did at the end, to my poor baby Dorian, made me wish that once Celaena comes back -- because she will come back -- she won't kill him. Oh no, I want her to keep him locked in a basement, to visit him everyday and torture him until he breaks, only to do it all over again the next day, because killing him would be too much of a mercy for the deeds he has done. The other secondary characters were very well developed: the Ironteeth witches, Ren Allsbrook, Emrys, Luca and Maeve -- they were a testimony to SJM's awesome writing skills. And I might add that for me the writing style was slightly different. Improved. Better. More realistic, if you wish. There was a certain ease with which she used words that enchanted you completely. Plus, the swearing. I don't mind it one bit, but am I the only one that noticed it appeared more often than in the first two books? Matured characters, matured world, matured language, I guess. The atmosphere is darker and the pace is thrilling, allowing you to breath for a bit before another near-death encounter or epic battle starts. The world-building was another winner, as we were able to see Wendlyn, Doranelle, the Ferien Gap and Adarlan again. We learn about the past, we meet Queen Maeve (who's quite a manipulative bitch), we run from terrifying creatures and we accompany Celaena as she masters her powers. There isn't so much romance in the air, besides Dorian's plotline, because it's the last thing in our character's mind. And honestly, I don't really know who Celaena is going to end up with. Chaol still has issues with her and Dorian is currently viewing her as his friend, but things could still drastically change since there are 3 more books. It seems that even Aedion, her cousin, might have a shot since he wouldn't deny anything his queen would ask of him. And then there's Rowan who I'm not sure will actually have a romantic involvement with Aelin, but it's worth hoping for -- they would be unstoppable. \u201cHe would not apologize for today, or yesterday, or for any of it. And she would not ask him to, not now that she understood that in the weeks she had been looking at him it had been like gazing at a reflection. No wonder she had loathed him.\u201d In terms of plot, you could say it's action-driven, but I beg to differ: the character development plays a part as big as the twists and turns and fights. It sure keeps you at the edge of your seat, courtesy of Sarah J. Mass' amazing writing, and makes you shudder at some new evil creatures or at the violence, but I basically view Heir of Fire as Celaena's healing journey, one necessary to fully accept her legacy. \u201cSo you\u2019d save another land, but not yours. Why can\u2019t your friend save her own kingdom?\u201d \u201cBecause she is dead!\u201d She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. \u201cBecause she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!\u201d The Throne of Glass series slowly becomes a younger version of Game of Thrones (with less deaths, but keep in mind that there are worse fates than death...) and I couldn't be happier. With the same complexity, a gut-wrenching intensity and an amazing world, Heir of Fire brings out the big guns: twists, emotional punches, tearjerkers and amazing characters, not to mention the wonderfully built world. It's definitely the best one from the series yet and a total game-changer, so don't be surprised if it will keep you enthralled from start to finish. Fantasy to its finest, a story with heroes and monsters, Fae and humans, life and death. Read it the second it hits shelves, cause you won't be disappointed (unless you're the type that can't stomach the idea of enduring another year for the next book and to whom I recommend waiting a bit longer, because there is one hell of a cliff-hanger).

It was incredible and I'm so happy with the way this story is evolving. NOW GIVE ME QUEEN OF SHADOWS. (full video review coming soooooon) I'm not sure what to say about Heir of Fire . Perhaps I don't need to say anything beyond: it took me months to read it. And I am the kind of crazy passionate reader that finishes good books in a day or two. It's been a while since a book took me longer than a week to read. So basically: I liked but had issues with Throne of Glass . I absolutely LOVED Crown of Midnight .

But this book... this book was so... bloody... sloooooowwwwwww. I wanted to DNF it so bad. I kept moving it between my \"currently reading\" and \"on hold\" shelves. I kept wondering if I could possibly just skip the last two thirds of this book and somehow pick the story up in next installment (I was informed that I could not). I have invested so much time and love in this series and these characters that I simply had to make myself finish... but holy shit, it was such a struggle. The majority of this book? So Maas tries to experiment with a bit of something different here and it neither a) works, nor b) fills me with much confidence for the state of the rest of the series. I'm seeing the way this whole thing is going... Book one was fantasy-lite with a simplistic plot, filled with characters lacking in any real development to distinguish them from others in the genre, but it was fast-paced, sugary entertainment. Book two cranked it up several notches; here the characters became more fleshed out and nuanced, the plot was equally engaging but more complex and clever, and there was way more badassery. No complaints at all. And then we arrive at book three. Heir of Fire feels like an attempt to be more sophisticated. It is well-written, contains several stories told through constantly changing POVs, and it is more than a hundred pages longer. And it is far far slower. Maas sacrifices everything deliciously fast-paced and compelling about her series in the first half so we can be introduced to a whole new cast of characters we don't care about, be taken through different (all boring) perspectives, and emerge feeling like we've read an extremely long filler book. Dorian's new romance only served to remind me why I found him unbearably boring in the first book. Celaena - now in Wendlyn - meets a whole set of new people who failed to make any kind of impression on me. Even Chaol - whom I absolutely loved in both other books - lost his charm somewhere amid his own boring plot line. And just when I thought I might be starting to get invested in one of the stories, the chapter would end and I would leave the story of interest for at least fifty pages, guaranteeing that I would no longer care when we finally returned. The most annoying thing about this book is how it wasn't even consistently slow. We'd get tiny little tidbits of awesome that would last a mere two or three pages and I would sit up a bit straighter and think \"This is it. Finally we're getting to the good stuff...\" until I realised it was just a false alarm and the story was still boring. If I'm to give credit where it's due, I will say that I like the way Maas portrays friendships and makes them as important - if not more important - than the romantic relationships. It's an area of YA so often neglected and I find it especially refreshing to see a platonic relationship between young male and female characters crafted so well. I will be reading the next book just because I have to give it a shot, but my expectations have been significantly lowered.

Picking up not long after the heart-wrenching end of Crown of Midnight, Sarah J Maas dazzles and entrances readers once more with a phenomenal third book filled with magic, character growth, sacrifice, rebellion and more. \u201cI wish you to become who you \u00adwere born to be. To become queen.\u201d Heir of Fire has most definitely made my list of best books of 2014. This book is quite different from the others in the series. I liked it a bit less than the other two, but it was so different it's hard to compare them. The other books center around romance and action while this book deals with the deeper stuff: betrayal, confidence, mourning, rebellion, heritage, loyalty... This book is huge. It was a bit cumbersome to hold, but the content was great! The beginning was a bit slow but eventually picked up. Everything written was absolutely necessary to carry the story though, so I didn't mind. The attention to detail was amazing. Everything was there for a reason, there were connections to the other books all over the place! It brought back all the feels from The Assassin's Blade & Crown of Midnight. Sarah J Maas is so meticulous about her writing and is truly in a league of her own. The tone of the book was much darker too. Maas has set this series on a much darker (and awesome) road than most YA series (even fantasy novels) tend to go, and I applaud her for it. The high fantasy aspect of this book was amped up. There was magic and wyverns and fae! I loved it all. This series reminds me of a YA version of Game of Thrones a bit... Less sex and deaths though. The world-building was fantastic. Everything was so clearly described. I could see it all playing out in my mind. The character development in this series is fantastic. Each of our characters has his/her own obstacles that must be overcome; they all have their own journeys. \u201cBecause I am lost,\" she whispered onto the earth. \"And I do not know the way.\u201d We see a totally different side of Celaena in Heir of Fire. We're used to the cocky, confident, invincible assassin. In this book we see the vulnerable, defeated, self-loathing side of her. In the end though she comes out more fierce and determined than before, a magic-wielding queen ready to take back what's rightfully hers. \u201cAs for Celaena,\" he said again, \"you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.\u201d Chaol struggles to decide where his loyalties lie and how he feels about Celaena and the discoveries he made in Crown of Midnight. I'll admit, Chaol annoyed me so much in this book. He redeems himself in the end though. Dorian struggles to conceal his magic and stand up to his father. Both characters come so far in this book. They sacrifice so much and in the end they make the tough decisions where this is no turning back. There are quite a few new characters introduced in this book: Rowan, the fae prince and warrior who teaches Celaena how to control her magic. Aedion, the fierce general and Celaena's cousin. Manon, ferocious heir to the Blackbeak witch coven. All of the characters in this book are so complex and well developed. The secondary characters are just as descriptive as well. I ALMOST ship Rowan and Celaena, but I think they're more of a team. He's so fiercely devoted and smart and honest and awesome!! Aedion is so loyal and amazing. Manon is okay, she's a bit too blood-thirsty... With new characters come more points of view. Overall I liked the various perspectives because the plot needed all sides of the story to make sense. Sometimes though I felt that some scenes were quite unnecessary and long and dragging. We learn so many things about Erilea and what happened to Celaena ten years ago. It's all quite mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. We also learn more about the King's nefarious actions. We see connections all over the place from the various books! Maas has been spreading the crumbs throughout the series until BAM you read Heir of Fire, and it all comes together!! The wyrdstones. The tower. The rings. The disappearances. The crumbled note. The rebels. Baba Yellowlegs. Everything happens for a reason and contributes to the story in some way. \u201cThe people you love are just weapons that will be used against you.\u201d Romance was not a big part of this novel. There are some heartache moments for our dearest Chaolaena and a bit of romance, but there are much more important things brewing in Erilea and Wendlyn. This series is past the silly romance, it's moved on to the important stuff like defeating a diabolical king, bringing back magic, freeing the enslaved, and so on. As I said before, this book starts off a bit slow. Stick with it though, if you liked the other books you'll love this one as well. The ending is horrific yet amazing at the same time. The rebellion is forming, and we readers are kept wanting more. \u201cHe would see that world reborn, even if it took his last breath. Even if he had no name now, no position or title save Oath-Breaker, Traitor, Liar.\u201d Heir of Fire is yet another amazing installment of the Throne of Glass series. WHERE IS BOOK #4???? \u201cShe was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.\u201d Pre-Reading Hyped Review: (view spoiler) [ Oh Captain...

If anything else, this third installment was without a shadow of doubt a set-up. Sure, there are tons of things that needed to develop did develop. Revelations were deemed to unfold, unfolded; but all those things changed my entire perspective of the story. Like the first two books were nothing but an introduction albeit a long one and we were now in this place where it actually started. In which is not entirely terrible. But I came to love all the things that happened in the first two and to see them changed didn\u2019t sit well too much with me. At least at the beginning. Now that I have let the nit-pick parts admitted, let me emphasized on this new journey. Celeana might have great bloodline(s) running through her veins and looks like from there things are getting harder and harder for her. But not without new companions. I didn\u2019t embrace them fully at first. There are quite few additions to the story and one that standout for me (all thanks to Celeana at one point did appreciate what a fine specimen her new companion is) was Rowan. Ok, as a big Chaol fanatic that I am I saw him at the beginning a threat. No, not in ship war kind of thing but of my own opinion. He made me feel like treading on tightrope whether he\u2019ll win me or not. But he did. I\u2019m inclined to love character that has loyalty (which at first had me questioning why) to the female MC (ala Hak from \u6681\u306e\u30e8\u30ca or Obi from \u8d64\u9aea\u306e\u767d\u96ea\u59eb). So where were the two main men before? This is not solely Celeana\u2019s journey for sure, those two have problems of their own. Chaol was little\u2026confusing for most parts (which was why I\u2019m bit disappointed) but if it means for his character growth then I\u2019m all for it. But my man Dorian is fighting back. I love the attitude, keep that up! And well, I smell potential romance for him? Well, I\u2019m glad for him (was there really something solid happened more than flirting? I beg to differ.). Going back to what I mentioned earlier, it was a set-up. After reeling everything in, pounded it in my head plenty of times; it actually made sense. And if I were honest that last line about Celeana\u2019s true identity is bound to leave a big tremor!

I'm going through this series for the fourth time and need to rewrite this whole fangirling review in some attempt to explain how amazing Maas is\u2026 (There might be a minor spoiler with how I refer to Celaena in the next sentence, buuuut I'm not sure how anyone's avoided that by this point). This is the book where it\u2019s kind of confusing whether I should call her Celaena or Aelin because she\u2019s both, yet neither... The series has always been about Celaena\u2019s journey for me, so this is definitely my favorite Throne of Glass book out of the first four! This is the point where she faces her past, tries to forgive herself, and finally accepts herself as Aelin. She completely breaks apart, finds herself at rock bottom, and rebuilds herself into a new person. This is definitely my favorite book for Celaena/Aelin because her character growth is brutally raw and incredibly realistic. Like my personality is COMPLETELY different from hers, yet I have never connected with a character this much. You can actually feel her despair, isolation, grief, and survivor's guilt. The whole story is an emotional rollercoaster and is still one of the few books that can make me legitimately tear up (that whole \"get up\" scene towards the end... omg). Celaena spends most of the book training with Rowan, who\u2019s also trying to heal in his own way. (And the way that Feyre & Rhys helped each other recover from Under the Mountain really reminded me of Celaena & Rowan\u2019s journey the first time I read ACOMAF). They're both broken but figure it out together: \u201dSomeone who might\u00a0\u2013 who did understand what it was like to be crippled at your very core, someone who was still climbing inch by inch out of that abyss. Perhaps they would never get out of it, perhaps they would never be whole again, but\u2026 \u201cTogether she said, and took his outstretched hand. And somewhere far and deep inside her, an ember began to glow. All of her character growth in this book is beyond impressive and SO well executed. The last 20% of this book is intense, but the rest of it moves at a slightly slower pace (which still totally works). So the second and fourth books are a lot more action-packed, but I think this third book REALLY gives the series the character growth and substance it needs in order to be so powerful. (I really do try to not turn every Maas review into a rant but then I hear from other people and get frustrated so here we go): people usually need to break and seriously remake themselves in order to be as strong as Aelin ends up being... otherwise it's just some hollow facade. (Like \"badass assassin\" is NOT Celaena's identity or personality. It's a persona she adopted in order to survive. She is more than that front... complex characters are ok and nobody is making you read this series if you hate it). Everyone else\u2019s storylines here really pale in contrast to Celaena/Aelin's, though. Like I seriously have the hardest time getting through the witch scenes in this book! I absolutely adore Manon in the following books, but really didn\u2019t care about much except for her scenes with Abraxos. Her wyvern is basically Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon and they're just straight up adorable together. And then the characters I initially thought I wanted to see more of, like Chaol and Dorian, weren\u2019t terribly interesting in this book either. Dorian mostly tried to find ways to hide his magic and wound up in increasingly worse situations. Chaol sat in a lot of different chairs in different locations. Aedion walked a lot\u2026 they pondered stuff. Their stories were mostly a lot of preparing for the next book (but all totally necessary). Things I want to see more of in Empire of Storms: - Luca randomly mentions that they \u201cdid have a female wander in with raw magic two years ago \u2014 she could do anything she wanted, summon any element, and she was here a week before Maeve called her to Doranelle and we never heard from her again.\u201d TELL ME MORE. - Dorian's magic - Rowan\u2019s cadre. - AEDION. CAN I PLEASE GUSH ABOUT HOW MUCH I LOVE AEDION, THOUGH. I totally picture him as Thor and it\u2019s pretty accurate\u2026 and he is the one death I could never handle. And can someone please give Dorian a hug?!? That poor, lovable guy is so alone and ignored (even in Celaena\u2019s flashbacks to when she met him as a kid). I adore his friendship with Celaena and how they can both see and accept each other as they are. And he knows Chaol loved a very narrow image of her: \u201d[Celaena] was not becoming anything different from what she always was and always had the capacity to be. You just finally saw everything. And once you saw that other part of her\u2026 you cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love.\u201d \u201cAs for Celaena, you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.\u201d Sorry, back to a side rant: Chaol is at a very confused place by the end of this book \u2014 he can no longer stand by everything he swore to defend and his entire identity is in question. People grow and change with life\u2019s events and Maas does an absolutely amazing job with her complex characters. So, no I don\u2019t think anyone is out of character in this book or the next. Especially Aelin: \"She didn't know what she needed... If she felt like admitting it, she actually didn't have the faintest clue who the hell she was anymore. All she knew was that whatever and whoever climbed out of that abyss of despair and grief would not be the same person who had plummeted in. And maybe that was a good thing.\" AND ughhh that last line was so emotional (especially after reading The Assassin\u2019s Blade): \u201dShe was Aelin Ashryver Galathynius \u2013 and she would not be afraid.\" ...more I definitely enjoyed this book more the second time around! It still is not my favorite in the series, but I'm SUPER glad I gave it another shot. What's funny is, the first time I read Heir of Fire, I skipped over many of Manon's chapters because I just wanted to read about Celaena, but this time, I was more bored with her chapters and was WAYYY more invested in Manon's! As Heir of Fire is what stopped me from continuing the series back in 2014, I am definitely more motivated now! I think I'm goi I definitely enjoyed this book more the second time around!

Dorian had been right about Celaena\u2014about Chaol resenting her darkness and abilities and true identity, but . . . it hadn\u2019t changed how he felt. And he doesn't mean it hadn't changed that he loved Celaena, he means that his acknowledgement of Dorian's assessment doesn't change his resentment. He RESENTS Celaena for being Celaena. 2. \"Until then, the fact remains, Captain, that you have not picked a side because you are still a boy, and you are still afraid . Not of losing innocent lives, but of losing whatever dream it is you\u2019re clinging to. Your prince has moved on, my queen has moved on. But you have not.\" I hate indecision. LOATHE, in fact. Throughout this entire book Chaol knows how evil King is. Knows that Celaena, the woman he supposedly LOVES, is the rightful heir to a kingdom destroyed by King, still subjugated by King ten years later. Knows that his best friend since childhood will be killed or worse should King discover his newly manifested magic. Knows that King SLAUGHTERED thousands of innocent slaves in work camps, and still he refuses to join the fight against him. Thinks he can just run along home to his pretty silver lake and stay out of it. *flares nostrils* You disgust me, Chaol. 3. \u201cYou once told me that when you find your mate, you can\u2019t stomach the idea of hurting them physically. Once you\u2019re mated, you\u2019d sooner harm yourself .\u201d \u201cYes; why?\u201d \u201c I tried to kill him. I mauled his face, then held a dagger over his heart because I thought he was responsible for Nehemia\u2019s death. I would have done it if someone hadn\u2019t stopped me. If Chaol\u2014if he\u2019d truly been my mate, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that, would I?\u201d He was silent for a long while. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t been in your Fae form for ten years, so perhaps your instincts weren\u2019t even able to take hold. Sometimes, mates can be together intimately before the actual bond snaps into place .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a useless hope to cling to, anyway.\u201d \u201cDo you want the truth?\u201d She tucked her chin into her tunic and closed her eyes. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d The first part is pretty self-explainitory. If Chaol was her mate, she would've rather died than hurt him. Clearly, this is not the case. The first couple times I looked this over, I thought it was fairly ambiguous, but now, I'm not so sure: \". . . perhaps your instincts weren\u2019t even able to take hold.\" Except she has spent LOTS o' time in her Fae form since then, once before she departed for Wendlyn. If Chaol was her mate, she'd know it. They'd be on the equivalent of a break, but that wouldn't change the bond. \"Sometimes, mates can be together intimately before the actual bond snaps into place.\" Except they were intimate and the bond still didn't form. And before you can start shaking your fists at me, YES, I concede it's also possible that all of this could mean the bond won't form until after they've been intimate again, now that Celaena is reacquainted with her Faeness, but, sorry, it feels much more likely that they just aren't mates. 4. Part of him still could not fathom what she\u2019d done to Narrok, the battle cry she\u2019d issued from across the sea. He could not accept that part of her , so bloodthirsty and unyielding. Even as Celaena, it had been hard to swallow at times, and he had tried to look past it . . . Eff you, dude. Eff youuuuuu. He knew they were monsters. He knew they were vile creatures made by King, but he can't fathom that Celaena killed their asses? And that makes her \"bloodthirsty and unyielding\"? Well . . . perhaps, YOU, sir, could stand to be a bit more bloodthirsty and unyielding. *mutters* Pansy-ass, fence-sitting jackhole . . . 5. She had awoken this morning and slipped the amethyst ring off her finger. It had felt like a blessed release, a final shadow lifted from her heart. Yeah, sorry . . . deciding to turn your mate lose wouldn't feel like a \"blessed release,\" if you were able to do it at all. (hide spoiler) ] Oh, oh!! Why I don't think Sam's dead: (view spoiler) [Riddle me this, Batman: why give us Sam if he was just going to die, the end, no take backs? Yes, it bonds us to Celaena, but that could've been accomplished any number of ways. Ways that didn't involve also bonding us to Sam. I can't take full credit for this, b/c the idea was planted in this blog post: https://shadowhunters13.wordpress.com... Which was brought to my attention by Aly\u221e And since the idea took root, I've decided that I don't think Sam was the creature underneath the clock tower (at least I hope not, b/c Celaena killed it), BUT I do think he's one of those demon prince guys. Maybe that makes him nothing but a Sam shell inhabited by pure evil, but I'm thinking we haven't seen the last of him. (hide spoiler) ] 8/18/15: Reread with Buddies Books and Baubles . Abraxas, I'm coming! Reviewed by: Rabid Reads 4.5 stars Heir of Fire begins with Celaena lazing about\u00a0on a\u00a0rooftop in Wendlyn's capital city, drinking cheap wine (that she stole) from a jug, and feeling sorry for herself. Actually, she wasn't drinking it. She was looking for it, and when she found it, it was empty (having already been drunk). Shortly thereafter, she gets mistaken for a vagrant . . . By a vagrant. *snorts* But as funny as that was, for the first 15-20% of the book, I thought we were getting ToG's version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix . If you\u00a0haven't read Harry Potter, book 5 was filled with teenage ANGST and wallowing and self-pity, and as much as I appreciated Rowling writing the book accurately in terms of Harry's adolescence, it was still my least favorite book in the series. Fortunately, it didn't take long to see that Celaena wasn't wallowing . . . she was . . . trying to cope. The depth of her sorrow and regret . . . (<------it HURTS). Maas communicates Celaena's anguish so deftly that you can see her, hear her, feel her agony. But Celaena has never been one to sit around and twiddle her thumbs, feeling sorry for herself. She\u00a0pushes the things that hurt her to the side. She ignores them, and focuses on the task at hand. And that works fairly well for her . . . until it doesn't . . . I think a lot of us can relate to that tendency.\u00a0I see myself in her ostrich-like avoidance tactics, and I know firsthand that no matter how hard you try not to think about something, there will always be seemingly innocuous things that act as triggers . . . triggers that\u00a0send you spiraling into the depths of despair, b/c you have refused\u00a0to deal with the\u00a0things that lay heavy on your soul. \"Because she is dead !\" She screamed the last word so loudly that it burned in her throat. \"Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!\" Have you ever screamed like that? Screamed so loudly out of fury and despair that it feels like the lining of your throat is being eaten away by the acid that fills you? Celaena has . . . and witnessing to it almost makes you\u00a0feel like you have too. So we have Celaena desperately trying to control her magic, desperate for answers about the wyrdkeys, desperate not to look too closely at the guilt that surrounds her like a fog. And then we have Rowan Whitethorn . . . Rowan Whitethorn is a world-class jackhole. He's verbally abusive, he's scary as hell, and he is pissed about being ordered to babysit Celaena. But as with Celaena, there was more to Rowan than the obvious. He is nursing his own hurts,\u00a0and also like Celaena, he uses emotional distance to protect himself from further injury. Their similarities allow them to REALLY understand each other: \u201cYou collect scars because you want proof that you are paying for whatever sins you've committed. And I know this because I've been doing the same damn thing for two hundred years. Tell me, do you think you will go to some blessed Afterworld, or do you expect a burning hell? You're hoping for hell--because how could you face them in the Afterworld? Better to suffer, to be damned for eternity and--\u201d But Rowan isn't the only new character we meet in Heir of Fire . I don't know if any of you are <---A>Sarah J. Maas</---A> fangirls like I am, but I've been stalking her on Pinterest since before Throne of Glass was released. If you stalk her too, then you've been looking forward to meeting Manon Blackbeak as much as I have. Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak\u00a0Witch-Clan. Manon Blackbeark, who wears the scarlet cloak of the teenaged\u00a0Crochan\u00a0witch who was her first kill. Manon Blackbeak who says things like: \"It would be nice--really damn nice--to peel off the Yellowlegs heir's face one day.\" YIKES. Clearly\u00a0Manon is more than\u00a0just a surprisingly pretty face---she is clever and determined and ruthless . . . I'm fairly\u00a0certain\u00a0that she and Celaena would\u00a0have been friends in another life. The last important character we meet in Heir of Fire is Aedion Ashryver, Celaena's cousin and childhood friend. Briefly mentioned in Crown of Midnight , we learned that he grew up to be one of Adarlan's fiercest generals. And perhaps that is the reason we haven't\u00a0heard more about him before now. As discussed, Celaena is a master at avoiding painful\u00a0subjects, and a beloved friend who is\u00a0perhaps the only surviving member of her family (on the continent), who rains terror on\u00a0the remnants of Terrasen at the King's command would certainly qualify as \"painful.\" But once again, Maas gives us a character with depth, and Aedion almost immediately shows himself to be fiercely loyal\u00a0to\u00a0Celaena: \"All I want,\" he snarled, \"is for my people to be free and my queen restored to her throne.\" \"They burned the antler throne, Aedion. There is no throne for her.\" \"Then I'll build one myself from the bones of our enemies.\" As much as I hated Celaena's separation from the characters we all know and love, I loved the new characters too much for it impact my overall reading experience. I LOVE THIS BOOK. My only issue was\u00a0the POV changes in the first several chapters. They occurred frequently, sometimes\u00a0lasting only 4 or 5 pages at a time, and the result felt choppy and disjointed. So if that's a problem for you as well, don't give up---it gets better, I promise. And just b/c I can't help myself . . . this isn't a spoiler exactly, b/c if you haven't read Heir of Fire yet, it won't make sense to you. It's a pin I found on SJM's Throne of Glass board that inspired one of my favorite scenes from the book. ALSO, the pics of Rowan, etc. are also SJM pins and hyperlinked back to the originals, as is this one: (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] Throne of Glass remains my favorite YA series, and\u00a0in Heir of Fire , Sarah J. Maas proves that she has staying power. She\u00a0continues to create places we long to visit, if only they were real, and characters that\u00a0I'm not entirely convinced aren't real. Surely, given the depth of emotion Maas is able draw out of her readers, they\u00a0must exist somewhere . Or maybe Maas is just a true artist who makes us feel and believe and that is enough.

THE TIME IS NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE HEIR OF FIRE REVIEW IS HERE. Did you feel how dramatic that was? I had all that thought out before I even finished the book hehehe. Wow so the above review was something I wrote a year ago, it's so weird how fast time flies by #bittersweet. So I wanted to read and review this before it was published but I had so much going on that I didn't have time to finish this intense read, and when I say intense I mean SERIOUSLY INTENSE. I feel like I took a drug and went to another dimension for a couple of months LOL There have been many of times when the interestingness of a series noticeably diminishes with every book that is released until the plot is downright going no where; Which is why I thought it was incredible how fresh this 3rd book was (I even think it's better than the 2nd book!!). At first I did not like the idea of Celaena going away from Chaol and Dorian (as you can tell by the gif from my first review lol) but I soon realized that that was what kept the book alive, the new place, experience, and people she was meeting, it was all so brand-new. SO SPEAKING OF CHAOL AND DORIAN. I did not think I would be okay with Celaena being with anyone other than those two BUT I WAS WRONG, and if you thought this third book would finally narrow down who she's going to be with well then YOU ARE ALSO WRONG. Not only does this book not narrow down who she's going to be with but it also adds in two other boys into the mix, so now we have 4 boys and 1 Celaena...LOL. Choal's mindset is basically \"I love her with all my life but I don't like how she's a cold blooded killer...:(\" and I'm just like yeayeayea she's an assassin SO JUST LOVE ALL OF HER OR GET OVER HER. When Rowan was first introduced in the book I was like no no no but by the end of the book I was like YES YES YES. Except the author seemed pretty adamant on letting us know that they're just REALLY good friends...WUTSUP WITH THAT, that better be changing in the next book >.> OKAY NOW DORIAN. GOING FOR ANOTHER GIRL ALREADY?? girll wut. girl whyy. I secretly think Sorscha was a rebound and I also was secretly happy when I knew that that relationship wasn't going anywhere anymore if you know what I mean. (view spoiler) [since she you know, got her head chopped off and everything lol (hide spoiler) ] Aedion , he's basically passionate and loyal as hell even though he has not been able to see Celaena since they were children, not even by the end of this book so we'll have to see what happens in the next book. Nothing wrong with some distant cousin love right? SO that pretty much concludes this review, I know my review was mainly about the characters and the love interests but that is actually just one aspect of the book, I mean it is almost 600 pages after all; I don't want to ruin the story for you but I can tell you it was definitely EPIC . See you again for the next book in another year!! P.S. there were so many POVs; just thinking off the top of my head there was at least 7, which doesn't sound like a good thing but it actually contributed to the excitement and freshness. :) Untitled (Throne of Glass #4) Review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...

Throne of Glass was good, but it was obvious that the book was the first in a series, because you all noticed the inconsistensies and flaws. Now we're talking about a third installment and, after how awesomely flawless Crown of Midnight was, I was expecting Heir of Fire to be just as good. I'm gonna start with Dorian. In book one his relationship with Celaena ended for the sake of character development. Then, in Crown of Midnight his character does more than just be around his father's castle, and it's all to find himself a purpuse: magic. So, I thought that in this installment Dorian would try to learn how to control magic so his father wouldn't find out that little secret about his heir. But that didn't happen. Why? Sorscha. She was obviously a plot device reserved for the shocking ending of the book, but the way Sarah J. Maas ignored all that happened to Dorian in Crown of Midnight KILLED ME. He went back to the same yound bored prince who's tired of council meetings we met in the first book, and all because of a romantic subplot. Strike one. Sorscha is a servant--healer--of the castle and has been conveniently hidden with a cape of invisibility until now. I would have bought that had SJM added at least one POV of her in the past books. She is mentioned near the end of book two, but it isn't until this one that we get to know her. One small detail that doesn't make sense is how she reacts when finding out Dorian can summon magic. It all happens as an accident, but she doesn't get surprised or shocked as you would expect. Instead she so eagerly proposes to help the Prince find a way to control and hid his power from others. Another thing is that Sorscha is secretly in love with the Prince (who knew!), and he ends up falling for her. Their relationship was clich\u00e9. Tedious. Their chapters made me want to go to sleep, to be honest. A new romance at this point didn't make sense since Dorian should have been focused on magic. Dorian was heir to the mightiest empire in the world, and Sorscha was the daughter of two dead immigrants from a village in Fenharrow that had been burned to ash\u2014a village that no one would ever remember. But that didn\u2019t stop her from loving him, as she still did, invisible and secret, ever since she\u2019d first laid eyes on him six years ago. Seriously, Sarah? Chaol, oh Chaol. My precious cinnamon roll (yes, I just said that ) has proved, once again, why he's my ultimate favorite character in this series . I just adore his character development and how much he's changed and learned since I met him in book one. But if there's something that bothers me is how much hate he gets. Chaol can't even breathe without getting blamed for Nehemia's death. I wish SJMAAS would stop using that argument on him because 1) that wasn't under his control, and 2) Nehemia practically killed herself. It was not his fault that Nehemia died, not when the princess had orchestrated everything. Yet he had kept information from her. He had chosen the king. Even though he\u2019d claimed he loved her, he still loyally served that monster. Maybe she had been a fool for letting him in, for dreaming of a world where she could ignore the fact that he was captain to the man who had shattered her life again and again. CHAOL DIDN'T KILL NEHEMIA 2k15 \u201cI have magic\u2014there is no undoing that, no getting rid of it. And as for Celaena....\u201d He clamped down on the power that surged as he imagined\u2014for the first time, he realized\u2014what it was to be her. \u201cAs for Celaena,\u201d he said again, \u201c you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend. \u201d Anyway, his character arc has a very significant role in Heir of Fire. I liked how he started questioning everything he had been taught to believe about the King and his Kingdom . Chaol's somehow still loyal to Adarlan, but now his friends are much more important to him. That is why he sent Celaena away to Wendlyn and doesn't want to know anything about Dorian's powers. He wants them to be protected, but some people mistake that as if he doesn't accept them, which doesn't make any sense. Everything he has done is because he cares about them. Chaol has nothing left. He literally threw everything away by sending Celaena to where her relatives were. And trust me, if he didn't accept them as some say, he would have gone straight to the King to tell him about Celaena's true nature and Dorian's powers. And they would be dead already. But in this book he becomes a traitor to the King by working with Aedion Ashryver BECAUSE HE CARES. He has always cared about Celaena and Dorian and he never, ever, gets the credit he deserves. So I'm here to defend him no matter what. #CHAOLWESTFALLDEFENSESQUAD Celaena's chapters were definitely the most interesting aspect of this book. She arrived to Wendlyn full of hopelessness given the death of her best friend, and we get to explore her past more deeply. But it was hard to see her this way, because the assassin we all grew to love was showing a different and vulnerable side we are not used to. And I have to say that I have a love-hate relationship with this new Celaena. To become who she really is--embrace her real identity--she needed to reach bottom. And hell if she doesn't. So, Heir of Fire was more like a healing process for her . Celaena went back to her roots, faced her demons, found herself a new alley and now she is stronger than ever. Now, Rowan. Once in a while I come across a very strong and capable and sexy as hell male character who looks insanely handsome and gets the attention of all the readers. He's precious and beautiful and badass and blah blah blah, but lacks of personality. That is Rowan Whitethorn. I get it--I get why everybody adores him. However, he's more like that poster of your favorite guy from your favorite boyband that you put on your wall (never been there, actually). You wake up every morning and see him right there, looking at you, looking sexy af. But he's not real--he's just a poster. Empty piece of paper. (Yes, I just called Rowan empty.) And can we talk about how problematic Rowan actually is? He treated Celaena like sh**. He punched her and make her believe it was all her fault. He told her she was a coward who whould be better off dead. And worse... Lashing out at Rowan like that, saying the things she did, trying to fight with him... She\u2019d deserved that punch . More than deserved it. If she was being honest with herself, she was barely passable as a human being these days. She fingered her split lip and winced. NO. FUCKING. WAY. But after all that, when he watches the scars Celaena will forever carry on her back as a reminder of her year in Endovier, he has te audacity to feel guilty. Sorry but you're already doomed to the \"never in this life\" list, boy. Rowan saves her and, by the end of the book, he kind of sort of belongs to her. I don't want to believe something will happen between those two. I hope not because they both insisted on that everything about them was platonic. But just in case. \u201cI claim you, Rowan Whitethorn. I don\u2019t care what you say and how much you protest. I claim you as my friend.\u201d friend. Friend. FRIEND. It was a damn good thing Rowan had no interest in her , either, because she knew she was stupid and reckless enough to consider whether moving on in the physical sense might solve the problem of Chaol. There was nothing romantic about sharing a bed with Rowan, and they kept to their own sides. #NEVERFORGET Rowan is not the only new character in this book. Manon Blackbeak is one of the Blackbeak Witches, heir and leader of The Thirteen. I loved reading her chapters, although they could get tedious sometimes. She's fearless and cold-blooded and I like that about a character. I can see a infinity of escenarios for her, particularly now that she has Abraxos. What a lovely and highly-lethal pair. Reading about them was like watching How to Train you Dragon . Manon herself reminded me of Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones because of her pale hair and her dragon companion. So I wish SJM were a little more careful with those details. But I adore Manon anyway. \u201cYou are one of the Thirteen,\u201d she said to him. \u201cFrom now until the Darkness cleaves us apart. You are mine, and I am yours. Let\u2019s show them why.\u201d Let's talk about this shocking finale. SJM's has a very compelling and captivating writing, which helps out a lot given the fact that I'm a sucker for YA High Fantasy (I've said this like a million times). And it worked perfectly in those last hundred pages of the book. Those moments were action-packed and got me chewing my nails. And the feels--oh the feels. He looked at his friend, perhaps for the last time, and said what he had always known, from the moment they\u2019d met, when he\u2019d understood that the prince was his brother in soul. \u201c I love you. \u201d He\u2019d known, since the moment he figured out who she was, that while Celaena would always pick him, Aelin would not. I AM NOT CRYING. I AM PERFECTLY FINE. I. AM. FINE. OK. Now what I didn't like. 1) Aedion, who's creepy and boring and too possessive over Aelin. I don't like him. At all. Strike two. 2) Some plot-holes here and there. The most obvious one was Celaena spending several months training in Wendlyn with Rowan. She could have easily escaped for all the watch the King of Adarlan put on her. It doesn't add up since she's his fucking employee. You would think The King would like to keep an eye on his Assassin. But no one cared about bringing that up. Along with Dorian's awful character arc and the huge romance subplot, those were my issues with this novel, which kept me from rating it more that three stars. ...more Updated** 8/17... after rereading - I am STILL floored but I have so much more to say this time around.

I'm gonna get a little opinionated first, then I *promise* to get more lighthearted ;) ;) AND I promise to spare you of my SJM speech but you can read it in my other reviews. One of the biggest complaints that I've seen about this book is the fact that Celaena, our resident heroine and badass extraordinaire, is no longer herself. (Literally, I've read like 10 reviews today alone complaining about this.) So here it is... here is why I agree and disagree, and why I love this series so much. YES. Celaena is BROKEN for a good chunk of this book. Why is this so unacceptable? Is it supposedly because she is supposed to be all strong and mighty and a perfect heroine? Guess what. You can be strong and still end up broken. And you know what? Maybe you are brought back to a place of power and healing... only to be brought back to a state of shambles... before you become whole again. This is realistic... and it was realistic in my own life. So I'll say this.. anyone who knows what it is like to be strong, passionate, full of hope, and then has found themselves in a position of pain to where it hurts to get back up again... I think you'll relate to this story. \u201cBecause she is dead!\" She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. \"Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!\u201d Yes, it is hard to swallow watching a beloved character to be in a state of complete wreckage. I'm so thankful that SJM decided to share this part of Aelin's journey. I honestly did not connect with her that much until this book. Sure she was fun to read about before- but this book hit it home for me. We get so much insight to her past... why she was running - everything. It is completely and utterly heart breaking. This is probably the line where I really lost it emotionally.. because she lost it emotionally. \"Fireheart, why do you cry?\" \"Because I am lost and I do not know the way.\" But- this is also a story of beautiful hope, and of finding the willpower to get back up. A story of choosing the hope of a future instead of remaining in the guilt and defeat of your past. AAAND not to mention.. how much true friends can help you back on your feet. \u201cIt was a long story, and sometimes she grew quiet and cried - and during those times he leaned over to wipe away her tears.\u201d So while I totally agree that this is entertainment and not to be taken too seriously- I can't help but nod to Sarah for showing a realistic character arc in a character we love so deeply. And you know what? Celaena has now moved on from being a broken, hurting, cowardly assassin who ultimately looks out for herself - to Aelin; a woman dedicated to her people - willing to sacrifice everything about herself to give them a home again. Someone willing to fight for something other than herself. OOOOOK ok ok... now onto some fun.... ENTER ROWAN. Oh ladies, we love to hate him, and then love to love him. This guy is a serious piece of work... but I can't help but adore him. He is every bit as broken as Celaena is , though he shows it in a different way. But how freaking beautiful is it when they connect to each other... understand each other? Bloody brilliant. He was EXACTLY what she needed... and did anyone take notice that he was the first one to call her Aelin (aside from Maeve) and Fireheart? Also- HOW are people comparing him to Tamlin?? That kinda enrages me because it couldn't be farther from the truth. I'm not going to argue this in this review-but you can read a nice long detailed comparison HERE - I highly recommend it. Oh, hi... MANON... So I gotta be honest. I kinda skimmed her parts. I know, I know. Terrible of me. I just got so hooked on Aelin's story.... so I promise to go back and reread these. So I can't write an accurate review or even any feelings towards this storyline because I just wasn't into it. I did end up loving her in the fourth book though! I'm just not into the whole witches thing. Though I gotta say- freaking Abraxos is the best- so much personality.. I LOVE HIM. CHAOL ... Our dearest and most adorbs (albiet ever scowling) Captian of the Guard -- who deserves a serious hug... My heart just breaks for him. I adore Chaol. Sarah has done something that she does best with him too.. she's ripped him up a bit. He made bad decisions in the past (LIKE WE HUMANS DO...). But if I can give you any bit of hope... his story is not a lost cause . He's just trying to sort everything out- everything he believed in was shattered. DORIAN ...Puh lease.. Like I could ever forget about you. Oh sweet Dorian. The poor guy gets the crap end of the stick EVERY TIME but still chooses to be his good and honorable self. That being said, his story isn't *quite* as interesting in this book... but just you wait and see what SJM is building for him. He's SO freaking cool in book 4.... you guys... I can't even. THE LAST 30% OF THIS BOOK Oh hell yes. How freaking clever and awesome was that?!? Want a hint at what the 4th book, \"Queen of Shadows\" is like? It's 10000% like this. Action packed, clever.

Overall I'm really happy with the direction this series has taken. This book is a lot more than just a romance that happens to have a magical setting. It's an epic fantasy. That being said, I didn't really get into this one until the second half, and it took me FOREVER to get through the first half.

I think that's mostly because Celaena got on my nerves a lot in the beginning. She seemed especially whiny and moody, and the self loathing was getting a little repetitive. Plus there really just wasn't a lot happening plot-wise. I understand that SJ Maas had to take time to build the relationship between her and Rowan, but I feel like it could have been expedited a little. Also, I wasn't really a big fan of Manon and all the stuff going on with the witches and the wyverns. I don't know, that storyline just seemed out of place here, like it belongs in another book. I guess it's because none of that action was directly related to what the other main characters were doing at that point, but maybe their paths will cross in Queen of Shadows. And every time I read about Manon and Abraxos, I couldn't help but think of Flint and Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon, lol. If it wasn't for the slow pacing around the middle of the book, I would have given this one five stars because the ending was BADASS. I thought all the battle scenes were very well written, and I enjoyed Celaena's flashbacks and learning more of her backstory. I had been wanting that for a while. And the climax with Dorian, Chaol, Aedion, the king, and Sorscha was really heart-rending. Everyone's story ended on these amazing cliff hangers and I'm SO glad I don't have to wait around for QoS now to see what happens next. I can just five right in ...more Chaol Westfall, return to my life! Well that's how I used to feel...now all I want is Manon and Abraxos!

That is the best way to put it. It was a book that I had to keep putting down because it was so slow . It was a book that made me hate characters I had previously loved. It was a book that made me want to bash my head up against a wall and actually do my final university assignments instead of procrastinating. It was also a book that took me over a week to read and if you know me you know that is an extremely long time for me to be stuck on one book. Now, I'm not saying all of Heir of Fire was bad. I did find myself loving the witches, Manon in particular. I also found myself growing to like Rowan, despite all the negative things I had seen about him before reading this book. However, I found myself hating both Celaena and Chaol, as well as my absolute hate for Dorian being cemented even further. Now, you may think this is harsh, but I don't think so. I think that these characters were completely bland in this particular book and that is what made this book slow. The other thing is not a lot happened, in my opinion. It was all filler knowledge through Adarlan and wherever Celaena was (don't remember). Aedion was the best thing happening in Adarlan and that was all that mattered to me, if a chapter was told from Chaol or Dorian's perspective my groan was heard loud and clearly. I found the pair to be incredibly whiny this book, having no depth and loosing all credibility I had previously given them. Characters Celaena Celaena bored me throughout this book. I couldn't stand the fact that she couldn't do anything by herself. She constantly had an excuse, she was constantly calling herself a coward and being unable to do anything. Sure, there was development. Development I enjoyed, but that didnt excuse the fact for 90% of the book she was incapable of doing a single thing. Now, remember how I said I wasn't going to mark spoilers? This is your final warning to skedaddle before I start the spoilers. \u201cCelaena Sardothien, gloriously mortal Celaena, never had to worry about accidentally scorching a playmate, or having a nightmare that might incinerate her bedroom. Or burning all of Orynth to the ground. Celaena had been everything Aelin wasn\u2019t. She had embraced that life, even if Celaena\u2019s accomplishments were death and torture and pain. Despite knowing that Celaena was in fact Aelin before staring the series it was interesting to see how she came to accept it, despite being horrifically boring. I felt some hardcore girl power each time she brawled with Rowan and was like finally . I mean, the lack of romance that featured in this book made her stronger as an indiviudal as well. Since her thoughts weren't constantly focused on a man. I mean, she occasionally thought of Chaol but she did probably four times in the 500+ page book. For this, I give the girl a round of applause. That didn't take away from my ultimate problems with her and if the book had been told primarily from her perspetive I would have given this book one and a half stars. \u201cShe was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.\u201d Rowan Rowan was a character who I had heard a lot before going into this book. I know what's going to happen with him and I know who he's going to start dating. I mean, how can you not when you go on Goodreads and people are posting spoilers in their status updates? He's also Celaena's incredibly distant cousin (which I can see why people would get annoyed by a romance between the pair, but c'mon royalty used to marry their brothers I think some very, very distant relative works better for me). \u201cWhy should I waste flattery on a child who\u2019s already in love with herself?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re related, you know.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve as much blood in common as I do with the fortress pig-boy.\u201d However, as I read about Rowan I found myself actually liking him. He had a zero tolerance for shit when it came to Celaena, told it like it was, and the pair were always fighting. I've also heard he's abusive towards her, and as someone who has witnessed abusive relationships for 80% of her life I can tell you he's not. I hunted for the scene where people used it to label Rowan \"abusive\" and all I got was this scene: \u201cAnd then she said one of the foulest things she\u2019d ever uttered in her life, bathing in the pure hate of it. \u201cFae like you make me understand the King of Adarlan\u2019s actions a bit more, I think.\u201d Faster than she could sense, faster than anything had a right to be, he punched her.\u201d Now, after having a bunch of your friends killed and magic taken from a world, would you not punch someone who had offended you so horrifically? I would. Male or female. I would punch someone who said anything bad about my family or friends, without a doubt and not think twice. There's a difference between abuse and saying something so vial to a stranger that it deserves a hit. Now, some people may disagree with me, thats cool, but I can understand it. People just want to slap th elabel abusive on any relationship these days, I swear. Okay, now back to Rowan as a character. I enjoyed him mostly. The comments I heard about him didn't stop me from doing so which I enjoyed greatly. Favourite quote from Rowan? \u201cHe brought his canines so close to her neck that one movement would have him ripping out her throat. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d he growled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019ve been doing for ten years, other than flouncing around and calling yourself an assassin. But I think you\u2019re used to getting your way. I think you have no control over yourself. No control, and no discipline\u2014not the kind that counts, deep down. You are a child, and a spoiled one at that. And,\u201d he said, those green eyes holding nothing but distaste, \u201cyou are a coward.\u201d Savage, I love it. Manon Manon is the ruthless character I wanted going into this series. She was my favourite, without a doubt (can you tell by the three artworks I used for her?) She was badass, unforgiving and absolutely amazing . I couldn't help but love her as we saw her kill, be brutal, threaten people and then form a bond with Abraxos. \u201cManon had been born soulless, her grandmother said. Soulless and heartless, as a Blackbeak ought to be. She was wicked right down to the marrow of her bones.\" If only SJM had written Celaena like Manon becuase she is beyond kickass, the assassian figure I was expecting to see when I begain to read this series. The character I wanted. The character who used her beauty to her favour and wasn't spoilt. A character who had been around for hundreds of years and wasn't afraid to rip someones throat out. Now, doesn't that sound great? It does to me, which is why I loved Manon so much. Obviously she had some development, through her bond with Abraxos and how it changed her slightly - but I can't fault her in any way in the slightest. She is what kept this book at three stars for me, if she hadn't existed I would have lowered my star rating by quite a few. Dorian Dorian sucked. I didn't want a love story in this book at all but I somehow got one because Dorian will fall in love with the first girl that shows him interest. That's all I'm going to say about him before I go on a murderous rage. Chaol Now, if we remember correctly - Chaol was my favourite character previously. He was the character who made me want to read this book, ultimately. SJM ruined him for me in this. My fast thinking captain of the guard was replaced by a love sick puppy who could barely do anything for himself. It was horrendous. I hated him. I hated how he couldn't make up his mind. How he was just beyond frustrating. He made so many stupid decisions and couldn't own up to them a lot of the time. I hate how he's not going to get his happily ever after becasue I know what happens to him in the next book. Aedion Aedion was another character who made this book worth it. I was beyond happy that he was introduced because it felt he was the only sane on left in Adarlan as he fought to see his cousin again. I loved his character. I can't say too much more because SJM did not have by far enough chapters from his perspective. Plot The plot had too much going on. We had Dorian, Chaol, Celaena, Rowan, Manon, and Aedion all doing different things from the get go that it felt like I read eight books instead of one. It was all too much for one book and made it feel slow overall. Writing The writing just didn't do it for me this time. I was bored. It was so wordy that I felt myself going to sleep while reading it. Overall Overall, what would have made this book better was more Fleetfoot and much less slow feeling. \u201cShe was Aelin Ashryver Galathynius\u2014and she would not be afraid.\u201d ...more \"She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.\" 5 Stars! I have no words that will serve this book justice. This sequel is spot-on perfection! We all know Sarah J.

Things got more and more interesting in Heir of Fire . In this sequel we can see Celaena's different side \"She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.\" 5 Stars! I have no words that will serve this book justice. This sequel is spot-on perfection! We all know Sarah J. Maas's writing power can't be debated, so let me just tell you that once again, I was beyond amazed with the way she delivered this sequel using her usual scheme-- surprising her readers with a series of twists . Things got more and more interesting in Heir of Fire . In this sequel we can see Celaena's different side-- her vulnerable and helpless side. She's now delving into a new world called Wendlyn , the land of the faes. From there she met the ferocious Queen Maeve and her devotee, Prince Rowan Whitethorn who later on trained her to unfold her fire abilities. Meanwhile, Chaol and Dorian are having conflicts in Adarlan . Chaol is trying to protect Dorian from unleashing his magical abilities and exposing himself to the King and at the same time, he's allying with the King's General Aedion Ashryver , treading in dangerous waters in order to fight back against Adarlan. The character development of Celaena in this book truly amazed me. It's nice to know that she isn't a complete Mary Sue. She is brave yet at the same time she is flawed. In this book, I saw a Celaena who was haunted by her past and was constantly visited by those nightmares that will forever etch her mind. What happened to her when she was a child opened my eyes and made me understand her even more. The moment those flashback scenes were narrated-- I died a thousand times. I wasn't able to help myself but cry and feel so sorry for her. What a cruel, cruel experience it was for Celaena! What also impressed me was the establishment of the new world , Wendlyn. Wow. It was utterly refreshing. I loved how SJM described this magical land and all those faes and demi-faes that are living there. Not only did the author give us a new setting but she also introduced a bunch of new characters that in a way, changed the entirety of the book-- like Rowan, Aedion Ashryver, Manon, Sorscha, and Ren . I especially loved Rowan. For me, he is character-driven and full of mystery. And I loved the way he's too brave to protect Celaena and guide her all the way to becoming what she is. He is simply... adorable. :) Aedion, on the other hand, also enthralled me with his masculinity (Am I too shallow? Lol). Actually, I kind of hated him at the start but later on I warmed up to him when I discovered what his true motives are. His dedication towards his people and his queen was truly remarkable. And Manon. This witch is so kick-ass! I have never fangirled over a female antagonist before but there was something in her fierceness that strangely gave me goosebumps. She's still a mystery to me, though, and I can't wait to read more about her character in the next books. Now on to Chaol and Dorian. Their friendship was tested big time here but I was amazed to find out how deep their bond is and how they're both willing to give up everything just to save one another. Dorian's character development was great here. Where's the weak Dorian we've met in the first two books? NON-EXISTENT. I loved how he stood up against his father. I also loved the way he schooled Chaol and said these things to him: \"You cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love.\" Oh, Dorian, I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE! Now while I saw a huge development in Dorian's character, I found it lacking in Chaol. I don't know but it seemed as though his character only shined in the final chapters. The action scenes in this book, on the other hand, were too terrifying and so beautiful I can't help but gasp. I particularly loved those scenes where Rowan trained Celaena. I loved the banters and the way their friendship bloomed. What I also loved was how secrets were slowly unfolded. Celaena's past and roots, the missing Wyrdmarks, Maeve and her sister's history, what really happened before the magic in Erilea was vanished... Wow, there were really lots of things that were unraveled here and I'm so glad. It was definitely a huge improvement. So I wrap everything up by saying that this sequel lived up to the first and second book. There were so many things that happened here that wowed me. I'm now excited to dive into the fourth book, Queen of Shadows . I know there will be a lot of huge obstacles that need to be overcome by Celaena and the rest of the characters, so I'm crossing fingers that they will get through it and defeat the King. ...more Disclaimer: PREPARE FOR FANGIRLING.

Man, am I glad that I was sent a finished copy of Heir of Fire rather than just an eARC, because I am going to quote the crap out of this beautiful, beautiful book. It really surprises me how each installation of Throne of Glass seems to up the scale of the world by such a large degree. More character development, more points of view, more exploration of the world- and frankly, a ridiculous amount of pure awesome. She'd been running for so long that she didn't know what it was to stand and fight. There is a very nice balance between the points of view. Maas very deftly manipulates the POVs so that I was never bored in one section compared to another, although I must admit, Celaena's did have the most pull. Despite there being a mass of new POV characters, Maas manages to give each one a distinct voice, and the transitions between them are smooth. Okay, I'm going to break this next bit up into sections because I'm having difficulty trying to contain the flailing and gushing. The Romance Maybe she had been a fool for letting him in, for dreaming of a world where she could ignore the fact that he was captain to the man who had shattered her life again and again. I just feel ridiculously fickle because I keep changing my mind about who I ship with Celaena. In The Assassin's Blade, it was Sam. In the first half of Throne of Glass it was Dorian (because oh my god he gives her a puppy how can you resist the puppy). In the second half of Throne of Glass and in Crown of Midnight, it as Chaol- strong, loyal Chaol. And now in Heir of Fire, the other three love interests have been completely swept away by one of the new characters. I'll let you guess who. One thing I do like about the romance, though, is that it's very open at this point. Quite honestly, I think she could end up with any of the love interests (um, except Sam. Unless he returns as a ghost. I would ship that lol). And I would be fine with her ending up with any of them. They're just all that amazing. Manon \"Once all that is done,\" she said, smiling faintly at her wyvern, \"you and I are going to learn how to fly. And then we'll stain this kingdom red.\" We're introduced to this badass Ironteeth witch in Heir of Fire, and damn, her storyline is epic. I won't say much more about her part in the story, except that I am very much looking forward to Manon and Celaena's storylines merging- it'll either end in blood or in an alliance. I think it might even be both. Dorian HOLY SHIT. THE ENDING OF THE ARDALAN STORYLINE. OMFG DORIAN. OMFG. That is all. You know how I feel when I think about how long we have to wait for the next book in this series? Dead. I feel dead inside. In conclusion: should you buy this book? Yes.

Heir of Fire begins with Celeana drunk and mistaken for a vagrant in a distant land. She is approached by the fae warrior Rowan, who is sworn to her Aunt Maeve, and they journey together to her realm to meet with her. In order for Celeana to obtain the secrets of the Wyrdmarks from Maeve, she must train with Rowan and prove herself worthy of entering Doranelle, where she will find the knowledge she seeks. Rowan and Celeana clash instantly. Rowan believes Celeana to be nothing but a spoiled, royal brat (which we all know is the furthest thing from the truth) and Celeana sees Rowan as a judgmental tyrant. Training together tests both of their boundary's and limits, physically and mentally. Darkness lurks in the woods surrounding where they train, and the two encounter many types of monsters over time. But nothing can prepare them for what is to come... \u201cIt would not take a monster to destroy a monster - but light, light to drive out darkness.\u201d The first book in this series was very much a young adult fantasy book. The second book introduced a lasting political plot and the groundwork for the overall evil to come. This book, oh this book. I don't really even see it as a \"young adult fantasy\" book. Heir of Fire was so much more than that, and it read like an adult fantasy book to me. There were so many complex themes, emotions and issues that are not usually present in ya fantasy, and Sarah J. Maas did an incredible job writing this book. \u201cThese days, I am very glad to be a mortal, and to only have to endure this life once. These days, I don't envy you at all.\" \"And before?\" It was her turn to stare toward the horizon. \"I used to wish I had a chance to see it all- and hated that I never would.\u201d The theme of this book was very much self-acceptance. Celeana must come to accept her past and her heritage. Chaol must come to accept that the King he serves is an unjust ruler. Dorian must come to accept the magic within him. I loved the characters, the world-building, the plot, the adventures, pretty much everything this book had to offer. And the most surprising part, this book had little to no romance in it, and I still loved it! (That's almost unheard of from me). Despite there being no romance, there seem to be 4 men who Celeana could end up with. FOUR! -Chaol: her ex-lover who still pines for her and regrets the choices he made that led to their end. Chaol believes Celeana to hate him, yet he risks his own life and betrays his King who he serves to help keep her alive. (And I felt so freaking bad for him the entire time. I have a soft spot for Chaol). -Dorian: I'm still listing him as a contender because there are 3 more books in the series, so we will never know. It would be nice if he got a chance at Celeana. -Rowan: Their relationship was strictly friends in this book, but it has the possibility to turn into something more. The connection the two have runs deep. -Aedion: Celeana's very distant cousin and childhood friend, who she has not seen in years and yet he is still loyal to her. I suspect he has feelings for her... My favorite part of the book was the character development between Rowan and Celeana. Their relationship is not one that can be defined by words, but only with feelings. Both know what it is to be enslaved in one form or another, and their connection is spectacular. I really hope there is more about the two of them in the books to come. \u201cYou collect scars because you want proof that you are paying for whatever sins you've committed. And I know this because I've been doing the same damn thing for two hundred years. Tell me, do you think you will go to some blessed Afterworld, or do you expect a burning hell? You're hoping for hell--because how could you face them in the Afterworld? Better to suffer, to be damned for eternity.\" I would say my least favorite part of the book was the witch plot. To be honest, I did a giant reader NO-NO and began skimming and then skipping those chapters. My rating of the book does not include those parts because I didn't really read them, as I had a hard time trying to care about those characters. ....So now I guess I can twiddle my thumbs until the next three books. After this book, I have faith that Sarah J. Maas will deliver something incredible in the next three volumes. I am so happy to be on this journey. \u201cShe was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.\u201d ...more \u201cYou didn't need a weapon at all when you were born one.\u201d Actual Rating: 4.5/5 stars I'm surprised.

Characters: Newest and most promising addition to the world of Throne of Glass is Manon Blackbeak, a heartless and ruthless witch and heir to her covens leader. It was her chapters that I enjoyed the most. And my favourite character is definitely Abraxos. Rowan bothered me at first. In a Not Another Romantic Sidekick For Calaena Please -way. But in spite of this first impression he grew on me and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in the sequels. Sorscha was rather plain. Her increasingly romantic relationship with Dorian felt too forced for my taste, and I expected the outcome in a way. Plot: Initially I wasn't interested in this book at all. But luckily it turned out to be something far from what I expected. Maas used book one and two to set up a story that she can now build on. And while I had trouble believing in the earlier books' paranormal events, Heir of Fire finally had me convinced. The Valgs, demon princes from another world, seemed far more credible than Calaenas former battles in other-dimensional shadow realms full of darkness and danger. Additionally I was glad to be rid of that annoying love triangle. I can't stand love triangles. The different POVs took Heir of Fire to another level. Especially since none of them have yet been led together. We get to see three parallel storylines set in three different places with characters that couldn't differ more. Humans, witches and fae. A guarantee for adventure and variety. I often struggled with the predictability that Maas used to create her stories. Opposites attract, girl falls for asshole, asshole turns out to have a soft spot, etc. It's a big huge old clich\u00e9 and I'm so tired of it. Which is why I'm more than happy about Manons POV. It was something so unexpected and new, that I gained new interest in the series. This was my favourite part of the series so far and I hope for Queen of Shadows to be even better.

The one big thing this book had going for it was its ending\u2026( OMG WHOOSH!!!! THAT ENDING!!!! BOOK FOUR IS GOING TO BE CRAZY!!! ) I read so many reviews where people were saying \u201coh the first half of this book is like a 2 compared to the second half which is like a 5 star\u201d , and I think people were right. The first half of this book was like pulling teeth. It was brutally slow!!! The main thing it had going for it was there were some really amazing new characters introduced (Rowan has me thinking Chaol who? <33333). The second half of this book is amazing. Sarah Maas finally starts unleashing a ton of Celeana\u2019s back story and you are really starting to understand why she is the way she is. There is even someone from her family introduced which I really enjoyed (not really a spoiler because it\u2019s really obvious) . There are a lot of twist towards the end of the book which totally made suffering through the first half worth it. (AGAIN THE ENDING OMG!!!!) Overall I loved the second half of this book so much and can\u2019t wait to get my hands on book four! And I think I like everyone else have switched teams and are really hoping that Celaena and Rowan end up having something going on (even though she's blowing through boyfriends like the Kentucky derby I don\u2019t care because I liked him so much.) ...more", "Title": "Heir of Fire"},
