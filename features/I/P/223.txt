His cast of characters is broad, including the mandatory historical personalities. Most prominent among these is William Tecumsah Sherman (\u201cUncle Billy\u201d to his troops), of the eponymous March. Pearl is a white skinned black, a slave fathered by her master. If there is a central character here, I suppose it is her, but not by a large measure. Arly is a petty criminal, who along with his partner, is released from prison by a Confederate general in return for his value as a soldier. He follows a twisted path to what becomes, for him, a glorious end. A photographer, or at least his assistant and his equipment, figure in this tale, as does a family. Two sisters in search of different things, one looking for her lost sons, another for a purpose in life. <---A>E.L. Doctorow</---A> - from The New York Times <+++>The March</+++> is an image of the road, a literary metaphor as well as a physical one. While all the characters walk the path blazed by Sherman to some degree it is the paths each blaze personally that resonate. Pearl is on her way not only to Washington Square to deliver a letter to a dead soldier\u2019s family, but to make a new life for herself, journeying from slavery to freedom. A German doctor travels a path to give his life meaning, but is unable to engage in his experience in a meaningful way emotionally, and so, in a way, remains where he is. A rou\u00e9 of a colonel enjoys his life as a ladies man while proving his mettle in the field, until he is undone by his own desires. When this is made into a film, and it most certainly will be, barring a significant rewrite it will be populated with an \u201censemble cast.\u201d No one character leads the way here. Sherman himself is not introduced until page 74. Whites of both the north and south share our attention with diverse black characters. Leaders occupy the same pages as the lowest on society\u2019s ladder. A brief Lincoln appearance is mesmerizing. Doctorow offers a tableau of an America on the march from a slave to a modern society, with a peek at many of the issues entailed in that transition. I was reminded of Whitman while reading this. Doctorow seems in Whitman\u2019s way drawn to the sinews of the real America. He paints a very real image of a major event in a significant time. And while one might feel a desire for a singular character to whom to relate, it makes more sense in this work to step back and take in Doctorow\u2019s pointillist approach, as the many individual specks add up to a very compelling image. Highly recommended ...more This was good, not great. Such has been my feeling about all three of the Doctorow novels I've read, Billy Bathgate , City of God and <+++>The March</+++> . All of these novels are well-structured, technically proficient works, and all contain something that makes them above average. But nothing quite makes them extraordinary. Some credit has to go to Doctorow, however, just for picking Tecumseh Sherman's march as his topic. This is a controversial subject, even 140 years later.

All of these novels are well-structured, technically proficient works, and all contain something that makes them above average. But nothing quite makes them extraordinary. Some credit has to go to Doctorow, however, just for picking Tecumseh Sherman's march as his topic. This is a controversial subject, even 140 years later. Truthfully, I most enjoyed the parts where Doctorow - a writer who proved in City of God that he has a top notch brain - tried to lead us inside Sherman's mind. The novel may have been better for me if it had been more about marching and obligation and mania than bit players. The Pearl character, specifically, just felt like Doctorow was trying too hard to make a somewhat tired social commentary; the ending of the book - with Pearl being \"ahead of her time\" - was uncharacteristically trite. Going into this novel, and knowing the abandon with which Doctorow tackled the existence of God in a previous novel, I expected more marching and more Sherman - and all the horrific choices an otherwise decent, but empirical-thinking, man had to make. Finally, the supporting cast of The March is what makes me hesitate to recommend this novel to historical fiction fans. For now, let's just let contemporary fiction fans enjoy it as an entertaining read that uses very interesting scenery in a pretty good way. ...more \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u062c\u0646\u06af \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u06cc \u0622\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628\u0647 \u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0645 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u067e\u0631\u0633\u062f \u0686\u0647 \u0641\u0631\u0642\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062e\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0645\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0647\u062f :\u0645\u0648\u0631\u062e \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0648\u06cc\u062f \u0686\u0647 \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642\u06cc \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f. \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633 \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0648\u06cc\u062f \u0622\u0646 \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0686\u0647 \u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f The March, E.L.

All das kommt auch vor, aber die Hauptrolle spielen die normalen Menschen, deren Alltag zerst\u00f6rt wird: Das hellh\u00e4utige Mischlingsm\u00e4dchen Pearl, das der wei\u00dfe Plantagenbesitzer mit einer Sklavin zeugte; Emily, die Tochter eines S\u00fcdstaaten-Richters, die sich, nachdem sie alles verloren hat, als Schwester einem Milit\u00e4rarzt der Yankees anschlie\u00dft; eben dieser deutschst\u00e4mmige Arzt Wrede Sartorius, der keinen Unterschied zwischen den politischen Lagern macht, aber merkw\u00fcrdig emotionslos scheint (diese fast faustische Figur findet sich auch in Das Wasserwerk. ); die Deserteure Will und Arly, die cham\u00e4leon-artig Fronten wechseln, um zu \u00fcberleben; das schwarze Liebespaar Wilma und Coalhouse, die von einem besseren, freien Leben tr\u00e4umen (Coalhouse wiederum wohl der Vater der Hauptfigur in Doctorows Ragtime ); der Soldat Stephen Walsh, der seine Jugend in Manhattan verbrachte (und daher frage ich mich, ob auch er mir in einem anderen Roman Doctorows bereits begegnet sein mag); und viele mehr. Selbst General William T. Sherman ist ein durchaus zweideutiger Charakter. Aus verschiedenen Perspektiven ergibt sich ein Bild dieser historischen Person, die man folglich bewundern, bemitleiden oder verachten kann. Und nach und nach werden die Personen eingef\u00fchrt, die mit ihrer Arbeit die Erinnerung an diesen Krieg f\u00fcr die Nachwelt erhalten werden: Die Fotografen Josiah Culp und Calvin und der Journalist Hugh Pryce. Letzterer stammt aus England und reist in General Shermans Armee mit, sozusagen ein fr\u00fcher \u201eembedded journalist\u201c. So ganz nebenbei bringt er damit den Vergleich zwischen alter und neuer Welt mit ein, wenn er zum Beispiel angesichts der Tatsache, dass Sherman von seinen Soldaten \u201eOnkel Billy\u201c genannt wird, denkt: \u201eGott stehe dem armen Schlucker von Gardisten bei, der Cromwell mit Onkel Ollie angesprochen h\u00e4tte\u201c. Oder, kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter, notiert er: \u201eWenn diese gew\u00f6hnlichen Soldaten, keiner von h\u00f6herem Dienstgrad als dem eines Feldwebels, inmitten ihrer gefahrvollen Pflichten, innehalten, um sich mit wesentlichen moralischen Fragen zu besch\u00e4ftigen, dann schimmerte daran f\u00fcr Pryce die Quintessenz des amerikanischen Geistes auf. Unter gemeinen Soldaten Ihrer Majest\u00e4t konnte er sich eine solche Diskussion nicht vorstellen\u201c. Nichts desto trotz muss er kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter erleben, wie die Zivilisiertheit in ungez\u00fcgelte Rache umschl\u00e4ngt. Kleiner Cineastischer Ausflug: Um mich auf die Zeit weiter einzustimmen, habe ich nach dem ersten Abschnitt den Film \u201eLincoln\u201c angeschaut. Man mag Steven Spielberg als allzu kommerziellen Blockbuster-Produzenten verurteilen, aber er wei\u00df schon was er tut. Und nur mir seiner (finanziellen) Macht kann man fordernde Stoffe mit einem solchen Star-Angebot auf die Leinwand bringen (mehr noch als \u201eLincoln\u201c w\u00fcrde ich hier \u201eAmistad\u201c nennen). Daniel Day-Lewis ist als Lincoln wie immer fabelhaft, aber auch die mit Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn und James Spader besetzten Nebenrollen \u00fcberzeugen. Nur die stets theatralisch-flennende Sally Field (hier als Mrs Lincoln) geht mir schon seit \u201eNicht ohne meine Tochter\u201c auf die Nerven. Der Kampf um den 13. Zusatzartikel der Verfassung, mit dem die Sklaverei in den Staaten abgeschafft wurde, wird eindringlich beschrieben; die Zweifel, die oft unsauberen Tricks mit denen politisch das Richtige erreicht wird (das scheint uns heute so klar, dass die Abschaffung der Sklaverei richtig war, aber auch die Gegenpositionen werden hier nicht vernachl\u00e4ssigt), werden dem Zuschauer nahe gebracht. Und immer wieder erstaunt mich die Tatsache, dass es die Republikaner waren, die sich f\u00fcr diesen Zusatz, gegen den Widerstand der Demokraten, einsetzten. Klar, es ging auch manchem Republikaner nicht unbedingt um ein Ende der Sklaverei, sondern in erster Linie um den Erhalt der Union und den Sieg des modernen, industriellen Nordens \u00fcber den S\u00fcden. Aber dennoch: Heute sind wir es gewohnt, die US-Demokraten als freiheitlicher denkend als die Republikaner wahrzunehmen, und dass nicht erst seit Obama. Aber zur\u00fcck zum Buch: Dass oft die Sicht von Zivilisten eingenommen wird, hei\u00dft nicht, dass der Krieg nicht eindrucksvoll beschrieben w\u00fcrde. Die Verrohung der Soldaten, die wohl bei jedem Krieg irgendwann einsetzt, spielt auch hier eine Rolle. Und die Vorgesetzten, Offiziere und Gener\u00e4le, schauen in diesen Situationen weg \u2013 nicht aus Gleichg\u00fcltigkeit, sondern weil sie wissen, dass sie ihre Autorit\u00e4t in solchen Momenten der Pl\u00fcnderung und Zerst\u00f6rung nicht behaupten k\u00f6nnten. Um ihrem Ansehen nicht zu schaden, lassen sie es bleiben. Und neben den durchaus intelligenten, besonnenen Gener\u00e4len, hebt der Krieg ja gerade solch fragw\u00fcrdigen Gestalten wie den Frauenhelden Kilpatrick in den Rang eines Generals, wo er ausgiebig privaten Gebrauch seiner Position macht. Glaubhaft wird Doctorows Kriegsbeschreibung zudem dadurch, dass er sein Personal nicht, wie man das in Romanen und Filmen oft erlebt, bis zum Ende \u00fcberleben l\u00e4sst. Immer wieder sterben Personen, die man lange begleitet hat und gerne l\u00e4nger begleitet h\u00e4tte. Aber der Krieg kann jeden treffen. Und so sind auch die Wendungen in diesem Roman kaum vorhersehbar. Dieser Roman macht sich viele Perspektiven zu eigen; er zeigt, dass es im Krieg nur Verlierer gibt, unabh\u00e4ngig vom Ausgang; er f\u00fchrt vor, wie der Krieg das Schlechteste (gelegentlich auch das Beste) aus Menschen herausholt. Der Roman zeigt aber auch, dass die milit\u00e4rische Befreiung von Menschen allein den Befreiten nicht hilft. Die Schwarzen, aus der Sklaverei befreit, bleiben besitz-, bildungs, -perspektivlos zur\u00fcck in den niedergebrannten S\u00fcdstaaten, die niemanden mehr ern\u00e4hren k\u00f6nnen. Wenn sie dem \u201eMarsch\u201c der Soldaten folgen, werden sie von ihren Befreiern vertrieben, zur\u00fcckgelassen, denn f\u00fcr einen Feldzug sind sie nicht zu gebrauchen und die Nordstaaten wollen sie auch nicht aufnehmen. Es gibt also viele Aspekte in diesem Buch, die einen auch an viel weniger weit zur\u00fcckliegende Konflikte erinnern lassen. ...more I'm a big fan of Doctorow, and we go way back; he's probably the first serious contemporary novelist I read, thanks to a copy of Ragtime acquired when I attended Ragtime Night at Comiskey Park sometime in the late 1970s (I find the notion that copies of a Doctorow novel were given away by the thousands at a White Sox game only slightly more mystifying than the fact that I was attending a White Sox game to begin with).

This, however, is not his strongest work. Doctorow used Sherman's March to the Sea as a backdrop for a big, sprawling, multi-focused narrative in the Ragtime vein; he even nods to that earlier work at one point through a minor character, Coalhouse Walker, Sr. -- presumably the father of Ragtime 's protagonist. But it doesn't work as well as Ragtime , I think because there's no central conflict tying all the narrative threads together. I suppose you could argue that the Civil War itself is that conflict, but Doctorow seems to have little new to say about that, and placing the emphasis on such a familiar historical narrative detracts from fully developing his characters. I think Doctorw's at his best when he manages to balance imagined social/popular histories with rich, fully-developed characters; Ragtime may be his masterpiece, but I'm even fonder of World's Fair and Billy Bathgate because they do that so well. Here, the history is too canonical, and the characters seem to disappear into it. Still well-written and diverting, but ultimately a bit disappointing for this fan. ...more Confidence Man era Melville, Whitman, Joseph Heller.

She however manages to evade them in favour of Stephen a Union soldier of Irish background. Since Pearl is passably white we are I suppose to assume that their ending will be happy ever after. And one can look at this as an optimistic ending - eventually the USA will come to a more perfect union, or a pessimistic ending - marital relations are possible only because the black woman passes for white, or one can feel that the XIXth century was the XIXth century and the XXth century looked back on that with its own eyes while the XXIst century will find its own way to somewhere (view spoiler) [ or you could read it for yourself and make up your own mind (hide spoiler) ] . The novel has a fairly brisk pace and shows the age of total war coinciding with the cusp of a modern era more generally, the ending of slavery, the development of surgery, the appearance of photography. There is I understand an overlap of characters with some of Doctorow's other novels, but it is essentially free standing, but unfortunately far less striking than Ragtime where the guys who crowd a tree like crows to catch a glimpse of a ball game crow about in my imagination still, and Ragtime's characters, possibly due to the fin de siecle heavy eating they engaged in, still have a tangibility to them, while the people of the March are more like figures in the fog to me. One for the completists I suppose. ...more A quick read and with so many characters and plot lines it is perfect if you like to channel surf or have ADHD.

The key cast is Sherman, Colonel Sartorius a Union regimental surgeon, Emily Thompson, the dispossessed daughter of a George Supreme Court Judge, the two misfit soldiers Arty and Will, and last but not least, Pearl the beautiful freed slave girl. The author provides a stunning description of the countless victims swept up in the violence of a country at war with itself. My mind wanders from Doctorow\u2019s descriptions of the families displaced by civil war to what I was watching daily on T.V. of the civil war refugees fleeing Syria to Europe. The book won the National Book Critics Award and the 2005 PEN/Faulkner award and was a finalist for the 2006 Pulitzer Prize. I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. Joe Morton did a good job narrating the book. ...more E. L. Doctorow is a master storyteller. The Civil War is the main story of this novel, but there are smaller personal stories as well.

Then the main characters become more defined and you become more invested in their stories or struggles. The March is a great name for this book because this was a huge movement of men, animals and materials. These thousands of men overran everything in their path. They were an immense force, not always strong, but cold, wet, bleeding and dying. In the end the reader has a fuller appreciation and understanding of the Civil War, a very important part of American history. This is the 5th E. L. Doctorow book that I have read and after reading The March I'm going to read everything that he has written. ...more I kind of feel about this book the way I felt about the movie \"The Departed\".

Stylistically he still creates an effective vehicle, and I read it from beginning to end fairly quickly; but very little in it either created real emotion or captured my complete interest. It is set in during Sherman's march to the sea during the Civil War, as seen through the eyes of dozens of charcters from North and South, both black and white, including General Sherman, the real (and total idiot) calvaryman General Kilpatrick, a former slave named Pearl, an Army surgeon and a half dozen others. He portrays the dirt, confusion and blood of war convincingly; but the charcters are too many and too thinly drawn to capture our interest. There is also too little context or back story for us to really care about what is happening to most of them (Pearl is perhaps the exception). There are moments where you feel like you are witnessing history (the burning of Columbia comes to mind), but it is not enough for me to fully recommend.

Doctorow describes the rampant pillaging and razing of southern towns from Georgia to South Carolina up through North Carolina in all their manic frenzy. What Doctorow does admirably well is his portrayal of Sherman\u2019s army as this living organism. In one scene he describes it as a barbaric, riotous mob; in another scene he paints the army as an ocean tide sweeping through town; in another scene he describes it as a herd of animals quietly grazing. The lens through which we see this living beast move through the south are the perspectives of a wide-ranging cast of characters: Pearl, a mixed-race child born from a plantation owner and one of his slaves; Emily, the daughter of a Southern judge, and a woman of the upper class struggling with the loss of her world; Arly, a Southern opportunist who makes good use of the chaos of war to jump from identity to identity to survive; Wrede Sartorius, an army surgeon with a stoic focus on his medical skills without thought to the greater horrors of the war going around him; and even General Sherman himself, portrayed as a moody and philosophical mad genius. Doctorow jumps from storyline to storyline, some connecting, others remaining separate. But Doctorow doesn\u2019t fixate on any one narrative, and even kills off a number of characters without warning \u2013 some after a dozen pages; one character dying after having been introduced at the beginning and carried through more than a 1/3 of the book. Because the characters themselves are only pieces of the larger story; the main character is still the Union army and its devastating journey. The prose moves seamlessly between describing the environs to describing the frenzied actions to describing different characters\u2019 thought processes and feelings \u2013 the prose itself feels alive, mirroring the Union forces. This book belongs in the same class of Civil War literature with Killer Angels, Andersonville, and the like. Highly recommended. ...more _The March_ (2005) by E.L.

I wasn't disappointed. The title refers to W.T. Sherman's 'march to the sea', specifically to the path of his army from Georgia through the Carolinas up through the assassination of Lincoln and Lee's surrender to Grant in Virginia. Sherman himself is treated sympathetically and serves as one of a dozen or so major characters, black and white, followed in the narrative. Interestingly, about half the characters are more and less attached in one way or another to the Medical Corps of the Union Army, giving a distinctive tone to Doctorow's treatment of war. There's little glory here. Noteworthy also is his having made several of his major characters African-American, most of them slaves, most of them recently liberated. For me, it was one of them, Pearl, who was the most engaging of his characters. ...more Well-written novel about Gen.Sherman's march through the Carolinas,after destroying the city of Atlanta.It validates Sherman's statement that \"war is hell\", not only for the soldiers on each side but also for the civilians,freed slaves,the wounded,the medical staff.

Writing an historical novel is difficult because, by definition, the author must stick closely with the historical facts and develop characters. The best historical novels also provide an excellent picture of the times. Without doing further research it must be admitted that Doctorow sticks with the facts. He does not meet the remaining criteria. Battles are fought and Sherman's army steadily moves through Georgia, then to Columbia, South Carolina and finally to Goldsboro Junction where the war ends. Sherman's object was to bring the Confederacy to its knees by destroying everything in his army's way. Farms and cities were burned, railroads and factories destroyed and Negro slaves freed. His description of the times is only partially compelling. He succeeds in describing the North's attitude toward freed slaves. Confederate forces were still active and frequently tried to stop Sherman's advance. At the book's beginning several hundred freed slaves trying to stay with Sherman to avoid CSA forces, were sacrificed when Sherman refused to permit them to cross a pontoon bridge and remain under his army's protection. Later, when he was advancing against CSA General Joe Johnston, Sherman once again sends the newly freed slaves off in a different direction to survive as best they can without the army's care. Doctorow is only partially successful in describing the times because he does not get into the minds and hearts of Southerners. There is little description of how desperate and confused these people were once they realized that their livelihoods and way of life were destroyed forever. How were they going to live with burned farms and cities as well as without their most valuable property and work force: slaves? March's most serious problem is poor and chaotic character development. Apparently Doctorow has watched too many TV dramas like Dallas and West Wing where action rapidly shifts between scenes. His rapid scene changing and replacing one character with another results in inadequate time to develop characters. The most developed character is Pearl, the child of a black master and a slave who passes for white. Through a series of meetings and adventures with various white men she losses her slave accent and learns to read. At the conclusion there is promise that she might attend college and become one of the first female doctors. Dr. Wrede Satorius, a European field surgeon in the employ of the Union Army, provides Doctorow with a means to describe the horrors of Civil War battlefield medicine. Amputations were so frequent that after battles a huge pile of newly separated arms and legs waited burial. Satorius is almost cartoon like. He has superior surgical skills and is contemptuous of his fellow army surgeons. Doctorow simply stops developing this character. Sherman is also inadequately developed. There is no explanation of his motivation and how he commanded. Sherman's march has the material for a good novel but it is yet to be written. ...more The March- E L Doctorw It seems as though in Goodreads reviews, I spend much of the time confessing my ignorance on various topics and countries - I console myself by thinking - isn\u2019t that why we read?

Therefore, being almost entirely ignorant of the American Civil war, I had little or no knowledge of the events of this novel and am still not entirely sure which were real and which were simply literary license. Perhaps a little of both, either way, Doctorow, as with \u2018Billy Bathgate\u2019 and \u2018Ragtime\u2019 has created a world that is eloquently written and completely enthralling. As he describes the events of the latter years of the civil war and primarily the \u2018March\u2019 of the Union army through the rebellious secessionist Southern states, we are privy to the thoughts of not only General Sherman himself but to freed slaves, an ex-pat Union army doctor, rebel soldiers, criminals and speculators, Southern belles and Northern politicians; even Lincoln himself makes a brief but noteworthy appearances. The freed Pearl stands out as the only character who is there from the beginning to the end of the novel. Often an obnoxious child, everyone seems to love her despite this, yet as the novel progresses the war makes her mature and her love for Stephen becomes her saving grace. As a character, Pearl appears to personify one of the many blurred antonyms that run through the novel, North and South, young and old, good and bad, black and white. As a white negro she stands apart from both the white and black worlds\u2019 belonging to neither yet as she realizes this is undeniable she is also that at least now she has the freedom to make her own choices whatever their outcomes may be. The other characters in the novel are all interesting in small ways even if some of them feature only briefly. Several appear in a few chapters and then disappear while some like Elizabeth, who is one of the primary characters at the beginning of the novel, simply disappear about half way through. This is perhaps to illustrate how so many people were displaced and lost in this war as in all wars. The marching army itself is permanently displaced in its role as a moving city and the only home its members know, their lives being only as secure as the ground on which they lay their heads at night. The scenes of battle are few yet poignant but what the novel prefers to focus on is the taking and ravaging of towns as the army sweeps through \u2018foraging\u2019 and taking what they want and destroying the rest. Doctorow manages to convey the experiences both of those who lose everything as well as the soldiers who are not always simply following orders. Arly is one of these soldiers who, along with his friend Will, constantly switches costume and identity if not allegiance and who as the novel progresses adopts new roles with greater exuberance every time. Again, this notion of fluid identity is made apparent as Doctorow makes clear that in war the line between friend and enemy, between the righteous and the evil is not as clear cut as we would like to think. ...more Review #31 of \"Year of the Review All Read Books\" The book was \"read\" via audiobook.

Joe Morton is a rather pleasant voice for this particular book. In fact, I've read/listened to a good deal of Ragtime for a college class once and I think it must be something about Doctorow's work that lends itself to reading well. The March deals with one of the pinnacle moments in the death of The South. And Doctorow deals with it in very Faulknerian fashion, the sentences dragging on with that mellifluous cantata, the ignorant characters who are very articulate in their ignorance, and, of course, the immense distress of The South's death in every margin of the book. Sherman is one of the more fascinating figures in history for me. The most striking thing that Doctorow does with him is make him a kind of harbinger for modernism. Americans, in their everlasting need to be first, might rightly claim that the Civil War was the first modern; that is to say one in which technology has clearly outpaced the tactics. Doctorow's Sherman has a longing for the romanticism of war, but cannot find it. And why is Grant so solemn today upon our great achievement, except he knows this unmeaning inhuman planet will need our warring imprint to give it value, and that our civil war, the devastating manufacture of the bones of our sons, is but a war after a war, a war before a war. Arly is a brilliant character, a right Shakespearean fool. He is that common man who understands every action and event as the graceful deliverance by God. He is thankful whether he is staring down death or about to deliver it. He assumes different identities (A Union soldier, Josiah Culp) because his identity as a white southern man is dying, being invaded and redefined. Parts of the story are remarkable, yet they always seem to be remarkable because they are dressed int he clothes of Faulkner. Perhaps like his impostor Arly, Doctorow cannot redefine who he is so easily, or else he labors in the guise of something that can only be imitated but never repeated unless he were to go back to conception and completely reorder his life and upbringing. Certainly well worth the read for any Civil War history fan. ...more \"You would like this,\" said my wife, \"you're a southerner.\" My brain began cogitating this suggestion. \"Uh, well, honey. . .

I wanted to hate this book, finding a strange sense of \"southern-ness\" bubble up as the Union troops kicked the crap out of the rag-tag Rebs, who remained mostly faceless and voiceless in the book. Perhaps it was the imagery of an antebellum mansion burning to the ground, or maybe the drawl of the southern belles lilting in my ear. But, let's be honest. Did I want us secessionist rednecks to triumph, clinging to an economic system borne on the backs of the brutalized? Of course not. Even more honesty: Doctorow has plotted this tale very well, and his prose style lends very well to the narrative. It bounces from one character to the next, and it keeps the dialogue confined to the paragraphs unencumbered by carriage returns and quotation marks. This style, though not as free and sparse as Cormac MacCarthy's, keeps the reader engaged with each character's point of view. I found myself hurrying through the passages involving Sherman and his generals, wanting more to be with the other characters, but would not want to miss the scenes of Savannah or Columbia. Even so, the fictitious characters do more for the story, and perhaps the history, than the supposing of the \"real\" people from the story. The cast of characters is large, but the plotting and pacing keep this story quick, and the struggles and voices keep you wanting the yarn to spin. After finishing the book, my wife giggled \"So, do you want to raise a glass to the surrendered?\" She then began singing \"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" which is supposedly the one song that could sing her to sleep as a child. Don't tell the Sons of the Confederacy, but \"Dixie\" makes me think more about the Dukes of Hazard than it does my southern \"heritage.\" ...more Every time I read something by Doctorow, often years after its publication, I am startled and delighted once again to just be in the company of such prose.

The nature of his observations, the range of voices in which he sets them - my pleasure in these things doesn't depend on what comes next or knowing what happens to each character. Does that mean I am less invested, identify less with the characters? Possibly, probably even. A paragraph from Welcome to Hard Times has stayed with me for over thirty years because it said what I could not about something I needed words for in order to bear it - and even then it was the language of an observer not broken by the truth. Now I am becoming that kind of person, or rather a person functioning with broken parts - I am rarely surprised, and finally finally empathic to a degree I wish I had been earlier. Wandering again - that's what I do here. I LISTEN to almost all books I take in these days - that has been true for years. One exception was actually Doctorow's novel about the two brothers living in a NYC mansion. The cast of characters was so small and the observations so delicate that the balance between caring for characters, for story, was balanced with my appreciation of language. Back to listening: The March is narrated by Joe Morton. This is the buried lead of my experience of the book : he is a brilliant narrator, and not every actor is. This is not the greatest book I have ever heard, but it is absolutely one of the best narrations. The pace and weight of the entire March is in his voice even as it twirls, bends, struts, and worries with its large cast of players. Perhaps that dovetails perfectly with my sense of simply relishing the telling - and admiring the teller - of this story. I'm on disc 7 out of 10. What if Joe was a guy telling me this story face to face and something interrupted us & I never heard any more? That would be all I had - that experience would be the equal of anything I learned. ...more La marcia su Savannah Ambientato nell\u2019ultima parte della Guerra di Secessione, evento che per gli americani ha un valore storico e simbolico paragonabile a quello che per noi europei rivestono momenti epocali come la Rivoluzione Francese o la Resistenza, \u201cLa Marcia\u201d ha il respiro epico dei grandi romanzi di Doctorow, ma secondo me difetta nell\u2019ambito della Poesia che l\u2019autore sapeva distillare anche in opere corali come Ragtime o Il libro di Daniel.

A tutto questo, Doctorow ha infuso sufficiente credibilit\u00e0 ma non troppa passione, per cui le pagine e i caratteri davvero memorabili restano limitati e danno luogo in definitiva ad un affresco storico compatto ma un po\u2019 freddo.

I knew just about next to nothing about this infamous march to the sea, and reading the book made me curious to learn more, which is probably a high compliment to the book. On the other hand I did get a little lost trying to figure out who were the Southerners and who were the Northerners, but that's probably more about my ignorance of Doctorow's references than the obscurity (*cough*) of his references. I was mildly surprised to find the book quite sympathetic to the South; I believe in an interview Doctorow said he was trying to make a statement about \"total war\" tactic which was essentially created by Sherman, but I don't know, I caught a few whiffs of \"Ohhh, how sad that this glorious way of life was so brutally ended by those marauders from the North who don't appreciate our genteel ways\" and even a whiff or two of \"Those slaves won't know how to live independently, how cruel of the Northerners to just throw them to the wolves like that\".

From Pearl, the spunky young slave girl born with the white skin of the plantation master who sired her to two shifty jailbird deserters who recognized opportunity when it knocked, we see the war as it truly was, raw, brutal and heart-wrenching. Arly and Will alternated roles between Confederate and Yankee -- whatever was most expedient at the time to save their southern hides. They could be viewed as comic relief, but for their actions in the end which were far from comical. Unimaginable losses were suffered by both sides in this bloody conflict, but we also witness the raw courage, quiet dignity and the desperate struggles of those just trying to survive. This book is character driven with touches of humor, bravery, stupidity and ruthlessness all mixed together. It will grab your interest from the first page and hold it to the very end. Pearl's cleverness and gumption after Sherman's destructive \"visit\" to her master's plantation will make the reader smile despite the mixed emotions she surely must have felt. Emily Thompson demonstrates unprecedented selflessness and charity amidst the madness of war by attending to the predominantly Yankee wounded and dying after having been stripped of all she held dear by their invasion.
