And the movie changed so much of the book that it made it difficult to settle into the book as an independent, standalone work. I have mixed feelings about both the book and the movie (which is irrelevant, except that it influenced my experience of the book). I'm impressed that Cecilia Ahern was able to imagine the scenario, flush it out, and write an okay novel about it at only 21 years old. And as a nice, sweet novel, it worked...<---F>I guess</---F>. But I've been widowed for 2 1/2 years right now--I was 27 and my husband 28 when he died--and from a grief standpoint and as representation of a believabe human experience, I only give it a C. Some of the issues raised are spot-on, but the level of \"healing\" and \"closure\" (both gag-worthy terms to a young widow) that Holly achieves in only a year are ridiculously unrealistic. I've met many young widows and widowers over the past 2 1/2 years, and all of them would agree that the plot of the novel is unrealistic. But hey--people read to escape, to vicariously experience a fantasy world. The sad part is that our culture is horrible at understanding grief, and stories like this--although sweet and pretty--only serve to reinforce false assumptions about what grief and widowhood are like for those who've never experienced it themselves. If only life, widowhood, and grief were as neat and tidy as Cecilia Ahern imagined.... ...more I seem to be one of very few who didn't like this book.

I hoped something would happen to make me change my opinion but it didn't. The whole book felt like a rambling and dull conversation with a repetitive yet inconsistent story-line.

One of my favorites among the books and authors I discovered as editor and bought rights for Serbia So badly written that it detracted from the touching and interesting premise.

The book is written by the daughter of the Irish Prime Minister which is the most interesting thing I can think to say about it. I like myself some chick-lit-lite but this is ridiculous. The writing was obvious, unsubtle, clich\u00e9d and dull. I did not connect with the characters and felt no emotional connection whatsoever with the story or the protagonist. I did not care what happened in the end. Having said this, I can see why this will be made into a film. The premise is actually not that bad: Widow receives a letter from her dead husband which he wrote before he died along with 11 other instalments to be read monthly to help her bereavement. It actually sounds really naff now I write it\u2026 But I honestly think the film will be far superior to the book. I hope so anyway. This does really annoy me though. It seems that to have your novel made into a film, you don\u2019t have to be a good writer. You just have to have a good idea. Seems a bit unfair to me. ...more I was really expecting a lot more from this book, being that it has been made into a movie but I was fairly disappointed. I understand that Ahern is a young writer but she really does have a LOT of work to do with her writing skills.

I know that may sound harsh considering she is dealing with the loss of her husband, and while I can't relate to dealing with something like that, I had a difficult time sympathizing with her. The ending was the most anti-climatic ending I've read in a while. Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this book to many people and most likely won't even see the movie because of it - and who would cast Hilary Swank for Holly's character in the first place?? ...more \"I believe that you should always leave loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.\" I've read and liked those words since long time ago but never really took time to think about it until an incident 8 years ago. That day, I was talking on the phone with Dad. It was just a casual conversation. Dad was planning to come to Bandung at weekend so he asked me did I want him to bring something for me and such. Things were usual until when we were gonna ended our conversation. U \"I believe that you should always leave loved ones with loving words.

That day, I was talking on the phone with Dad. It was just a casual conversation. Dad was planning to come to Bandung at weekend so he asked me did I want him to bring something for me and such. Things were usual until when we were gonna ended our conversation. Usually at the end of our phone call, I'd like to say : Love you, Dad . That time, I didn't know why but I hesitated to say it. So I just said: \"Okay take care, Pi\" to which he said : \"You too, kiddo. Be good. Love you.\" That was our last phone call. Two hours after that, my mom called to inform that Dad got a very bad headache and they were on the way to hospital. Turns out it was a first symptom of stroke. When I came to Jakarta, he was in comatose state and he never woke up again. To this day, I still regret for not saying the i-love-you words at our last conversation. And that's when the words dawned on me. I promise myself that whenever I part with someone I love, I'll leave them with loving words. Usually I try to keep that promise. But sometimes I forget and parted after the heated argument with my loved ones. The second incident happened around January 2009. At that time, I had someone that I consider as my significant-other. We've been together since the 1st grade at Elementary School. Yep...almost 21 years together at that time. We're a childhood sweetheart, the same with Holly & Gerry from this book. Unlike many other stories about childhood sweetheart, we started as a couple turn to best friend while still considered ourselves a s couple, then being a true best friend, and finally a true couple (kok ribet yaa). Of course, like Holly & Gerry, we could finish each other's sentences. We too could read other's mind. I know him more than I know myself and vice versa. That's what 20-years-of-relationship did to us. We were also a cool couple. Cool in terms of : we rarely argue because of jealousy. As an example, when I saw a pretty lady, I'm gonna tell him like this: \"Eh liat deh arah jam sekian. Cakep ya.\" . And after looking for some seconds (just seconds. Longer than that then he's in a deep shit. LOL), he's gonna say : \" Yep. Nice booty. Very sexy boobs.\" . Things also happened the other way around. See? How cool are we? (kok jadi pamer ya?) We're one of those couples that have thing you called as a comfortable silence. We could sit together for hours, saying nothing and just enjoying each other's companion. We've found home in each other's presence. For me, he's not just a boyfriend. He was also my bestfriend, my dream keeper, my most loyal supporter, my soulmate, or to sum it in one word: my significant-other. But it's all ended in one night. That night, we had a plan to hang out with our friends at our usuall place. He was supposed to pick Widya up (our friend whose house located between mine and his), before pick me up then heads to our meeting place. Because of overslept, he was late picking Widya up. Back then, I was a very very very punctual person. I could be really mad just because one minte late from the schedule. So at that time, though I know it was really irritating, I kept calling him just to ask him where he was and asked him to drive faster. I knew he was annoyed with my constant calls mainly cause I called him while he was driving. But I was selfish that time and I didn't care, so I just kept calling. When he arrived at Widya's home, he called me back and asked : \"Iya? Kenapa, babe?\" Now we're not the kind of couple who used petnames. Nay...that's not our style. Usually we just call each other with our name (real name, I mean). Or using missy-boy in a casual argument. And lady-sir if we wanted to tease each other. But he had this habit to call me with petnames when he was mad at me. He'd call me cutie pie, honeydew, love, well you know...petnames like that. I asked his reason once, and he said : \"So you'll know no matter how mad I was to you, I still love you\" (Yeah...I know that's cheesy) The sweeter he called me means the more annoyed he was. So on the 1 to 10 scale (with 10 being the maddest), \"babe\" was on number 5. Usually when I know he's on the 5th scale and up, I'm gonna back off and calm him down. But that night, I was really pissed too. So I replied him (still with an annoyed tone) : \"Dimana sekarang?\" \"Udah nyampe rumah Wiwid, Sayang. Kata dia tunggu bentar. Dia masih siap-siap.\" On his list, \"sayang\" was on number 8th. \"Cepetaaaannnnn.\" \"Iya, Cinta. Sabar yaaa...\" \"Cinta\" got the 10th score on his list. So actually that time I knew that he was really really mad with me. Usually, \"cinta\" is a sign for me to seriously back off and calm down. But still, I didn't wanna do it that night. \"Udah dulu ya. Tar gw telpon kalo Wiwid udah siap jalan. Love you.\" Since the period when we had a long distance relationship, we made it a habit to end our conversation with \"love-you\" and such, no matter how mad we were at each other. Again, that day I wasn't in the mood to say it back and just answer him with : \"Yeah whatever. Cepetan ya. Gw tunggu.\" Not an hour later, I got a phonecall from Widya. She told me about an accident that involved him and now they were on their way to hospital. When I got to hospital, he was already unconscious. He never wakes up again. Turns out, the \"love-you\" was his last words to me and \"yeah-whatever-cepetan-ya-Gw-tunggu\" was my last response to him. Bad, eh? It's been almost 4 years since that. There are many things that I've learned and could accept with now. I have learned that being punctual is good, but being a very very very punctual person is a pain in the ass. I could deal with the pain of losing him and have the dreamless sleep now. I don't ask the universe anymore why 20 years long of relationship had to ended so abruptly like that. I just accept it as the-way-it-should-be. I could forgive the destiny for taking away someone who has a very bright future ahead in such a young age. I believe that this is the best for him and for everyone around him (Actually I still can't see why, but I just wanna believe that coz God always makes the best plan for His people). But... I still regret my last words to him. I still can't truly forgive myself for ended our conversation after a heated argument like that. At least with my Dad, things were good between us. And for me, this fact still hard to deal with. I envy Holly. No... I'm not saying that Holly's situation is easier or better than mine. There's no use in making comparison here. She lost her man gradually and I lost him so abruptly, blah....both are a fucked up situation to be in. I envy him cause she has times to bide her loved ones a proper goodbye. I also envy her because even 1 year after he left, she still got his letters that showing her how much he loves her. I know it's lame, but sometimes (back in the past) when I sort his things off, I wished that I got his letters or even note or anything that I could consider as his-goodbye (yeah...I know I've watched too many lame movies). Or at least a note which tells me that he knows though I was pissed at him on our last conversation but I still love him. Yup...that was one thing that I envy the most from Holly. Because Holly made sure that Gerry knew she loves him when he left this world. The one thing that I didn't do. Hey you, up there I hope you could read this. P.S. I love you \u201cFinding someone you love and who loves you back is a wonderful, wonderful feeling. But finding a true soul mate is an even better feeling. A soul mate is someone who understands you like no other, loves you like no other, will be there for you forever, no matter what. They say that nothing lasts forever, but I am a firm believer in the fact that for some, love lives on even after we're gone.\u201d PS : All in all, for me this is a good book. Unrealistic actually about that moving on things (the just-1-year-time-span which made it kinda unrealistic), but still it's a good read. Through Holly's journey and Gerry's letter, I got some lessons about healing. On the other hand, she was a women with a million happy memories, who knew what it was like to experience true love and who was ready to experience more life, more love and make new memories. Whether it happened in ten months or ten years, Holly would obey Gerry's final message. Whatever lay ahead, she knew she would open her heart and follow where it led. In the meantime, she would just live.\u201d Just like Holly, I'm a woman with a million happy memories. I could also proudly said that once in my life I knew what true love was. And I also knew that whatever lay ahead, I'd open my heart and follow where it led. But for now, while waiting that to happen, I'll just live. Thank you Ahern, for made me realize that a happy ending has many kind of shades. ...more After being obsessed with the movie for months, I decided to take the plunge and read the book. Finally.

There were so many changes made to translate this book to film. I won't go into them all here now because I wouldn't want to ruin it but let's just say they were significant. From love interests to careers, everything was different. And for that reason, I think I probably did it the right way round watching the movie first and reading the book second. I'm giving it 4 stars for because Cecilia Ahern is just so easy to read. It requires no effort to get into a rhythm and it's the perfect little book to pick up when you're in between epics. She tackles grief without making you feel life is pointless. There is always hope. And I think that's what Gerry gives Holly in her first year without him - hope for a new life. I'd say this little story gave me a similar feel-good feeling to The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. It didn't matter that it was tragic, it still managed to really touch me. Really it was beautiful. Read this novel if: You're looking for something inbetween other books and don't want to have to work too hard to enjoy the characters. Don't read this novel if: You think you could feel disconcerted or upset by the intense, overwhelming grief Holly is struggling to come to terms with. ...more I loved this book.

This book has also been made into a movie. I read the sypnosis of the film and decided I'm not going to see it. They changed the story and characters around.....her Mother they make out to be something different from the book. They change how she gets the letters and leave out what I think are important characters. I hate it when they do that to movies made from books. So before seeing the movie I advice reading the book. ...more Cecelia Ahern's debut novel, PS, I Love You, follows the engaging, witty, and occasionally sappy reawakening of Holly, a young Irish widow who must put her life back together after she loses her husband Gerry to a brain tumor.

Ahern, the twentysomething daughter of Ireland's prime minister, has discovered a clever and original twist to the Moving On After Death concept made famous by novelists and screenwriters alike--Gerry has left Holly a series of letters designed to help her face the year ahead and carry on with her life. As the novel takes readers through the seasons (and through Gerry's monthly directives), we watch as Holly finds a new job, takes a holiday to Spain with her girlfriends, and sorts through her beloved husband's belongings. Accompanying Holly throughout the healing process is a cast of friends and family members who add as much to the novel's success as Holly's own tale of survival. In fact, it is these supporting character's mini-dramas that make PS, I Love You more than just another superficial tearjerker with the obligatory episode at a karaoke bar. Ahern shows real talent for capturing the essence of an interaction between friends and foes alike; even if Holly's circle of friends does resemble the gang from Bridget Jones a bit too neatly to ignore (her best friend is even called Sharon). While her style can be at times repetitive and her delivery is occasionally amateurish, Ahern deserves credit for a spirited first effort. If PS, I Love You is any indication of this author's talent, readers have much to look forward to as Ahern matures as a novelist and a storyteller. --Gisele Toueg --This text refers to the Hardcover edition. ...more I tried reading this once before, a few years ago now. I put it down about a quarter of the way in because, frankly, I was bored. I saw the movie several months ago and actually found it a lovely mix of sweet and sad. I thought maybe I'd missed something in the book and not only that, but I've become well acquainted with this kind of loss in the time that has passed. Thinking that my new perspective might change my mind, I decided that at some point I'd give it another go. Well this week I gave I tried reading this once before, a few years ago now. I put it down about a quarter of the way in because, frankly, I was bored. I saw the movie several months ago and actually found it a lovely mix of sweet and sad. I thought maybe I'd missed something in the book and not only that, but I've become well acquainted with this kind of loss in the time that has passed. Thinking that my new perspective might change my mind, I decided that at some point I'd give it another go. Well this week I gave it another go and I can tell you that I only got about 20 pages further than last time. Now I find the book not just boring, but immature. This book is Ahern's supposition of what it must be like to lose your significant other at a young age. She clearly has no experience with loss, even of a friend or close relative. There is no real grief, or heart, in this book, nor are the characters' actions very realistic. Yes, grief is unique to both the circumstance and the person feeling it - but there are so many moments in here that are simply unbelievable. Some authors have the talent to write what they don't know. Ahern isn't one of them. My advice: don't waste your time. If you want to read about grief and lost loves, go read The Year of Magical Thinking instead. ...more Ho iniziato questo libro con delle aspettative molto alte che non sono state per niente deluse! -- Mi ha emozionato tantissimo, ho pianto a pi\u00f9 riprese, ho riso e sono rimasta completamente rapita da questa magnifica storia.

Que Ho iniziato questo libro con delle aspettative molto alte che non sono state per niente deluse! -- Mi ha emozionato tantissimo, ho pianto a pi\u00f9 riprese, ho riso e sono rimasta completamente rapita da questa magnifica storia. Holly e Gerry sono anime gemelle, praticamente inseparabili. Holly non pu\u00f2 vivere senza di lui, finch\u00e9 non \u00e8 costretta a farlo. Gerry, infatti, muore a causa di un cancro terminale al cervello ed Holly, vedova a soli 29 anni, non sa cosa fare per rimettere insieme i pezzi. Questo libro \u00e8 qualcosa di meraviglioso. Ecco cosa mi \u00e8 piaciuto, in poche parole: - Lo stile di scrittura della Ahern \u00e8 meraviglioso. Ricco, scorrevole e mai pesante. Penso che abbia inquadrato perfettamente i personaggi, la storia e gli stati d'animo e che abbia offerto a noi lettori un ritratto molto realistico del dolore, della perdita e del conseguente, ma estremamente difficile, recupero. - I personaggi sono molto relazionabili, nonostante alcuni siano un po' stereotipati. Mi \u00e8 piaciuta molto l'attenzione che ha dato ad ognuno di loro e al ruolo che hanno nella vicenda e, specialmente nella vita di Holly. -- Holly e Gerry, in particolare, sono i miei preferiti. Di lei ammiro la tenacia con cui affronta le cose e il suo adorabile senso dell'umorismo. Di lui, invece, l'immenso coraggio e la maturit\u00e0. - La storia d'amore tra i nostri protagonisti \u00e8 qualcosa a cui tutti potremmo aspirare. Si completano le frasi l'uno con l'altra, si comprendono, si divertono insieme pi\u00f9 che con qualsiasi altra persona al mondo. La Ahern ha ritratto l'amore dolce e giocoso che c'\u00e8 tra due vere e proprie anime gemelle e, nonostante il lettore lo viva attraverso i ricordi di Holly e dei suoi amici e qualche piccola scena qua e l\u00e0, \u00e8 davvero intenso. -- Ho apprezzato ogni scena che li ritraeva insieme, ogni ricordo e piccolo accenno. Mi hanno commosso davvero molto. - Ho apprezzato in particolar modo l'importanza che l'autrice da alla famiglia e agli amici della protagonista. Il loro appoggio \u00e8 fondamentale per Holly per superare questo momento difficile che sta vivendo, pi\u00f9 di ogni altra cosa. Mi \u00e8 piaciuto vedere le dinamiche con i suoi fratelli, i suoi genitori e i suoi migliori amici. -- Uno degli aspetti che ho amato di pi\u00f9 \u00e8 stata l'evoluzione del suo rapporto con il fratello Richard, inizialmente ostile, ma che poi sboccia in qualcosa di stupendo e che, ancora una volta, ha avuto la capacit\u00e0 di commuovermi ed emozionarmi. - Ho amato l'umorismo di questo libro. Cecelia Ahern mi ha regalato dei momenti veramente esilaranti che sono stati uno stacco piacevole dal dolore e dalla tristezza che provavo per altri. - (view spoiler) [ Una delle cose che ho apprezzato di pi\u00f9 \u00e8 stata la mancanza di un altro amore per Holly. Mi aspettavo che il libro si sarebbe concluso con lei e Daniel che finivano insieme; Sarebbe stata la scelta pi\u00f9 facile, ma la Ahern ha deciso di non cadere nella banalit\u00e0 e cercare di scrivere un romanzo il pi\u00f9 realistico possibile. Holly, secondo me, non era ancora pronta ad iniziare una nuova relazione, specialmente con un uomo che conosce da poco meno di un anno. Mi \u00e8 piaciuto molto il valore che l'autrice ha dato alla sua protagonista, che pu\u00f2 definirsi e, soprattutto, sopravvivere da sola anche senza un uomo. La perdita di Gerry \u00e8 stata straziante e lei ha tutto il diritto di soffrire e di sentire la sua mancanza, non deve per forza trovare qualcun altro da amare per ritrovare la felicit\u00e0. La felicit\u00e0 pi\u00f2 costruirsela anche da sola! (hide spoiler) ] - L'originalit\u00e0 di questa storia \u00e8 davvero sorprendente. Ho adorato l'idea della lista e tutto ci\u00f2 che questa comporta e porta nella vita di Holly. Non ho mai letto niente del genere! Il messaggio che porta con s\u00e8 questo libro, infine, \u00e8 un messaggio che ho trovato estremamente importante: non importa cosa succede, la vita va avanti .

Cos'altro dire? Ho finito questo libro da un po' e ho ancora gli occhi lucidi. Mi sono affezionata molto al personaggio di Holly ed \u00e8 stato quasi un onore per me vedere il suo percorso e la sua crescita mano a mano che giravo le pagine. Questo libro mi \u00e8 piaciuto davvero moltissimo e mi sento di consigliarlo a tutti, specialmente a chi ha il cuore tenero! ...more The world and its mother loved this book. I didn't. I couldn't.

Oh, and by too long I mean it was too long for the story, not as a book in general.

Then again, this is probably just another case of \"it's not you, it's me.\" I'm sure everyone knows what the story is, so I'm not going to delve into that, what I would like to mention, however, is that Ms. Ahern is quite a talented writer, and she really isn't a bad story teller. It's just that there is no story in this one. I get that I'm with the unpopular opinion here, but as I've previously mentioned, very few romance novels impress me, and this one just didn't cut it. I know I may come across as a heartless bitch when I say that, but it is what it is. Actually, I think one of the reasons I couldn't bring myself to like the book was that I couldn't sympathise with Holly. Pity her, I did, but I couldn't feel what she was feeling. And so another one bites bit the dust. ...more A Chama Que Nunca Se Apaga Os alvos do Amor s\u00e3o ef\u00e9meros, mas o Sentimento neles criado dura e perdura como Chama que Nunca se Apaga.

Holly's friendship with Daniel and her family members was very sweet. Could do with a lot more Gerry, too. Especially now that I see him as Gerard Butler. P.S. I Love You is an unusual choice for me since it starts off with the protagonist dealing with the death of her husband.

I Love You is an unusual choice for me since it starts off with the protagonist dealing with the death of her husband. Those who have seen my book collection would note that I go for high drama and sweeping romances, stuff for romantics who are in love with love. I always get the ones that start with the heroine being taken by the hero not realizing that they have been falling in love in the process. I couldn't say what drew me to the book but I picked it up and brought it with me to the cashier. The book starts with Holley Kennedy keeping to herself a few months after the death of her husband Gerry Clarke. Holly and Gerry have been together since high school and Holly's world revolved around Gerry since then. Gerry was diagnosed with a brain tumor and rounds of medical procedures have not stopped him from succumbing to the death that it brought with it. Holly closed off to everybody, wallowing in the grief that Gerry's death brought. She had no appetite and no desire to continue with her life as it was before Gerry passed. Ahern's storytelling style had her cutting back and forth from the present to the past, illustrating the relarionship that Gerry had with Holly, her family and their circle of friends. Through these flashbacks, the readers learn that they shared a joke called \"The List\" which Gerry promised Holly he would write for her so that she can cope with the loss of Gerry. As Holly realized some time in the story, of all of Gerry's promises, this was the hardest for her to accept since it meant that he was gone. Turns out that Gerry did prepare a list for Holly some time between his medical procedures. He sent a package to Holly's parents' house which contained individual envelopes labeled from April to December with a letter to Holly that she open an envelope per month to do Gerry's list for her. The tasks went from buying a bedside lamp (since it was always a nightly thing for them to argue who would get out of bed to close the bedroom light) to conquering her fear of karaoke to a wonderful Spanish vacation with her closest friends, to finding her dream job. In between the tasks, Holly learned more about her family and friends as well as how life continues despite the all the loss. Ahern created compelling characters that tell about growing up, the poignancy of loss and of rediscovery. The characters are real people that they seem to jump out of the pages and at me. They are flawed and human in their reactions and in their choices. It rocked me to the core since it made me think of the what ifs. It made me realize that I have a wealth of family and friends by me. We may not always get along but we bring value and joy to each other's lives. ...more I had bought P.S. I Love You with a collection of other chick lit novels on Ebay before the movie had come out yet. So I figured I would just read the book first for once and see what I thought of the movie after. Now that I've done that, I have to say I really enjoyed the book so much more. The two were vastly different and many things were left out of the movie, but I guess with 512 pages, there's a lot of story you have to cut. I just didn't expect them to change SO MUCH of it. Like Holly's s I had bought P.S. I Love You with a collection of other chick lit novels on Ebay before the movie had come out yet. So I figured I would just read the book first for once and see what I thought of the movie after. Now that I've done that, I have to say I really enjoyed the book so much more. The two were vastly different and many things were left out of the movie, but I guess with 512 pages, there's a lot of story you have to cut. I just didn't expect them to change SO MUCH of it. Like Holly's sister as a character in the book, is so much more developed and I had really liked her. Though its a very touching and emotional story, almost to the point where it freaks me out a little bit (I mean what young married woman wants to imagine her husband dying!), I still couldn't put the book down to see what the next letter he wrote to her said. It was just so romantic and beautiful. But the grieving process that Holly goes through isn't altogether too realistic in my opinion. I mean packing up her husband's things only months after he's passed - no way could I do that! At least the book portrays the grief as more of a struggle and process than I felt the movie did, which was good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. Though maybe read it after you've seen the movie, so you have a basis to start from and maybe won't be as disappointed in the movie as I was. And for being Cecilia Ahern's first novel, I thought the concept was great. I look forward to checking out some of her other novels, for I'm sure she'll only grow as an author. ...more I'm not a big fan of PS I love you. Gerry is romantic and makes some wonderful gestures that make his wife realize she's not alone in dealing with life after Jerry. But thanks to these sweeping romantic gestures, they're out of money (nothing left even to pay utility bills) and Holly has to beg her Mom for money. PS: Take a splurgy vacation with your friends, then come back and make the most of the remaining $10 in our joint account! PPS I love you! This was MUCH different than the movie, but I really liked it, I think even more than the movie. It's a honest, raw look at the long road of healing and finding yourself again after losing a part of your heart. Again I liked the movie more than the book. I feel like a mean person saying it for a newly widowed woman, but Holly is an insufferable little shit and I hate her. I chose this book one day when I was in the mood for something different than my usual fare of high fantasy, smart science fiction or classic literature. I spent a long time perusing the chick-lit shelves (not being a fan of the genre, normally) before settling on this book, and I was not disappointed with my choice.

Holly is a widow who watched her husband die from a lengthy illness and is having a hard time dealing with it... But her husband has planned for that and has left her help in that arena. The book is by turns heart-breakingly sad and side-splittingly funny, sometimes in the same paragraph, and you will end up laughing through your tears or vice versa. It is sweet, poignant, and (usually) not too sappy or angsty and stresses the importance of family and friends during a soul-trying time of loss. ...more I had such high expectations for this book. What I wanted was a poignant and heart-breaking portrayal of a widow's emotional state, and all I got was a lot of a small talk and boring everyday family time. Like, A LOT. Yes, Garry\u2019s notes were touching, but way too short to be a significant part of the novel. It starts off with the protagonist dealing with the death of her husband. Holly keeps to herself a few months after Gerry had lost a battle with brain tumour. They\u2019ve been together since high I had such high expectations for this book.

It turns out that Gerry prepared letters for Holly from April to December that she has to open at the start of every month to do Gerry's list for her. There are too many dialogues and all of them are lifeless and dull. While I like Holly's family dynamic, it's kind of a drag, and I needed plot to happen. Eventually, the plot never really occurred, all events had been extremely slow. I thought this would be much better, since I really love the movie version. I made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, thinking that the book is always better than the movie. It was too long. This book has 470 pages and nothing relevant happens. Holly is awesome, she was the best part of the novel. Despite the plot being weak, she was a strong protagonist and made me laugh numerous times. Her struggles felt genuine and I really wanted her to move on. All she ever wanted was to be a wife and a mother, and it was interesting to watch her seek for a new purpose. I didn\u2019t know enough about Gerry to be sorry he\u2019s gone. I could feel Holly\u2019s love for him, but I couldn\u2019t feel her loss because I didn\u2019t know what exactly she had lost. There should\u2019ve been more flashbacks about their relationship, because there was more telling than showing, and you know how I can get insufferable when this happens. Holly's bond with her distant brother Richard is really intriguing. I loved how they developed from having awkward silences and not having what to talk about, to complete understanding and support. Honestly, their bond alone had better development than Holly\u2019s healing process, that I\u2019m not even sure ever happened. Or was badly described. Holly and Daniel have zero chemistry. I liked how their bond resolved in the end, but that unnecessary tension that the author tried to create only added to the negative impression. Yeah, they had interesting scenes, but their connection was forced. If there was no mention of anything romantic between them, I\u2019m sure this book would be much better. ...more With the movie coming out, I finally decided to read the book (however, I don't intend to see the movie as it looks really bad). I wasn't sure what to expect from the book. I didn't know a whole lot about the book before reading it, other than the basic premise. In keeping in line with my love of all things Irish, I enjoyed that this book was set in Dublin. I'm surprised that that author was as young as she was when she wrote the book.

In keeping in line with my love of all things Irish, I enjoyed that this book was set in Dublin. I'm surprised that that author was as young as she was when she wrote the book. I also can't help but like the fact that she's the daughter of the Irish prime minister....but that's irrelevent to the book. I thought the characters were incredibly well developed. It is every wife's nightmare to be in Holly's position but I feel like she captured as best as possible what it would be like to be her. There were so many moments where I found myself crying, which was a bit awkward because I was reading this on the train. Unlike a lot of chick lit books, the side characters were also well developed. Her friends and family were portrayed in a realistic and entertaining way. I especially loved the sibling dynamics. I did have some issues with the ending of the book but I don't think that's a bad thing. I don't believe that one has to agree with every decision an author makes in order for it to be a good book. All in all, Ms. Ahern does a great job of straddling the fine line of writing about a woman trying to get on with her life after the death of her husband. ...more A young married couple, Holly and Gerry, have a joke between them: If anything ever happened to him, he'd have to write her a list or else she'd never be able to cope without him. \u201cThe List\u201d grew to encompass advice for any eventuality, a joke all their friends shared.

The novel includes a cast of raucously funny and memorable characters, including Holly's best friends and four siblings who range in personality from the pink-haired world traveler Ciara to stick-in-the-mud Richard. Set in Ireland, the book has a wonderful Irish atmosphere reminiscent of Maeve Binchy and Marian Keyes. PS, I LOVE YOU is a warm, witty, heartfelt and romantic story about family and the eternal nature of true love. ...more Excerpt: \u201cBut Holly, nobody\u2019s life is filled with perfect little moments.

I think this story is so dear to me because, for me, it\u2019s not just about losing a husband but someone you love, really really love, and how hard it\u2019s lo keep going after they\u2019re gone \u2018cause they might not be with you in person but you still need them and that need doesn\u2019t go away with them\u2026 but then you realize something\u2026 life doesn\u2019t stop just \u2018cause your heart is broken, even if it feels that way, and you have to keep going. I loved the movie and I loved the book\u2026. and I\u2019m still looking for my Gerry\u2026 ...more I really,really liked this book.It was so beautiful and well written.", "Title": "P.S. I Love You"},
