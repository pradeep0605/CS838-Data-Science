While I appreciated McCourt's attempt to recognize teachers (especially English teachers) and the work (often underappreciated) that we do, I felt that his theory of if we all \"think outside the box\" and try to be friendly with our students, than we will have a successful teaching career, a bit unrealistic, overly idealistic, and in many ways, condescending. While I do admire some of his methods, and enjoy his writing style, I found that the times when he let his true sentiments show (like telling a kid to stop being so ignorant and have some respect for the English language, or having days where you were just sick of whining teenagers...does that make me mean or already jaded?)or when he simply let the student anecdotes speak for themselves, were my favorite parts of the book. I do think this is a more honest perception of teaching (especially the first part where he is working in the \"tougher\" schools during his first few years) than many other movies I've seen that try to portray teaching. Some of the autobiographical stuff could have been left out--too much information sometimes. ...more My fourth book by <---A>Frank McCourt</---A> and I am still impressed. <+++>Teacher Man</+++> (2005) is the last book of his 3-part tragicomic memoir and it is about his experiences as a teacher in at least 3 schools in New York.

He spent 33 years teaching high school students before he retired at the age of 60 and wrote his first book, Angela's Ashes at the age of 66. The book changed his life tremendously. He won a Pulitzer in 1997. National Book Critics Circle Award in 1996. He met President Bush, Lady Diana and other well-known personalities because of it. However, looking back, what he most treasured in his life was the opportunity to influence the many future American citizens. The schools were he taught at? vocational and technical school (McKee), adult education - teaching English to immigrants mostly mothers(New York City College of Technology) and later in the Harvard-equivalent for high school in the US: Stuyvesant High School where only the brightest high students are admitted. So, McCourt had enough challenges and to be able to survive that long means that he must have loved teaching. Afterall, teaching is said to be one of the noblest professions. Although there is almost nothing about Ireland and his poor family background in this book, his funny and witty lines are still much evident. I particularly enjoyed his conversations with his students particularly the immigrants who did not know much about literature and grammar. Those poor immigrants who came to America during that time (early 70's to late 80's) barely knew English and thought of themselves as nobody and McCourt took patience in turning that wrong belief around. They ended up liking William Shakespeare and appreciating Hamlet. Something that I can relate with since I have not read Hamlet yet. Ah, four lovely lovely books. It was nice knowing you, Frank McCourt! I will now read those two books ( Singing My Him Song and A Monk Swimming ) by your brother Malachy McCourt (born 1931) and 1 book ( A Long Stone's Throw (1998) by Alphie McCourt (born 1940). I wonder if these younger brothers of yours are also as brilliant as you are when it comes to writing memoirs :) ...more Teacher Man is as good example as any that if you have wit and personality you can tell an entertaining story. I think McCourt, with his humble yet playful, self-degrading Irish charm could read from the phone book and hold a reader's attention. But he has lots to say worth hearing, as he recounts thirty years of teaching in New York's high schools and community colleges.

Siccome ormai abbiamo la confidenza adatta, e non mi piacerebbe essere disonesta nei tuoi confronti, te lo devo dire, ho pianto per le prime trenta pagine di questo ultimo libro. Ho pianto per quell' ultimo , anche se stavi scrivendo della tua a dir poco verosimile esperienza con l'insegnamento; onestamente credo sia da pochi riuscire a far piangere per la commozione mentre si stanno raccontando degli episodi che farebbero ridere anche il mio tutor di privato che \u00e8 sempre stizzito per via del fatto che non muoiono i docenti e non si becca la cattedra. Separarmi dalle tue parole \u00e8 stata una scelta per me dolorosa, ma dovuta e di coraggio, di bisogno sopratutto, perch\u00e9 volevo sentirmi dire da te che nella vita bisogna farsi spazio, che della vita bisogna saper apprezzare con un sorriso anche quelle situazioni in cui uno ha voglia solo di rinchiudersi in un bunker e sperare che i Maya o chi per loro c'avesse visto bene. Non te lo dico, anzi, s\u00ec te lo dico, a costo di essere banalmente ripetitiva o insulsa: darei tutto ci\u00f2 che ho per poter tornare indietro nel tempo, iscrivermi al Liceo Stuyvesant di New York e assistere alle tue lezioni di scrittura creativa. Non tanto per l'insegnamento della scrittura creativa, dato che non ne sapevi granch\u00e9, quanto per l'insegnamento di vita che m'avresti detto facendomi vedere che a volte bisogna imparare a scherzarci su, anche quando fa pi\u00f9 male. Sorrido ad uno schermo di computer a pensare a te in cattedra, sprovveduto, infilato a forza nel ruolo di insegnante, che cercavi pi\u00f9 di apprendere che di insegnare, che non esaurivi mai la curiosit\u00e0 e leggevi come leggo io, Fitzgerald come se fosse un diamante, non uno semplice scrittore. Forse son troppo di parte, forse dovrei scriverti due note di rimprovero sul fatto che bevessi troppo, e che predicassi bene e razzolassi male, ma tutto ci\u00f2 che vedo tra le tue parole, che son l'unico elemento che ho per poterti conoscere, \u00e8 un'anima bella innamorata della speranza. Un po' come io non sono, un po' come io vorrei essere. Ho letto le ultime venti pagine con una lentezza quasi stoica, con una ripugnanza per la fine che mi addolorava passo passo, parola dopo parola perch\u00e9 sapevo che ogni parola era una in meno verso la conclusione delle tue memorie. In generale sono abbastanza pettegola, e quando scopro un autore nuovo la prima cosa che voglio sapere era se fosse sposato/poligamo/single, se avesse vissuto scandali e tutte le cose da classici rotocalchi rosa. Ma la tua vita l'ho letta in queste tre puntate perch\u00e9 dalla prima riga della prima pagina delle Ceneri di Angela sapevo - anche se tu non lo sai -, che questi libri li avevi scritti per me, affinch\u00e9 io imparassi. E quindi, svestitami dei panni della pettegola, ho indossato quelli della sensibilit\u00e0 cos\u00ec che ogni tua singola parola mi ha trapassata da lato a lato lasciandomi un segno, un segno che fosse una risata della grossa viste certe cagate che hai combinato, un segno che fosse un insegnamento visto certe vite che hai vissuto, che fosse un sostegno, visto che mi sei pi\u00f9 di quanto siano molti altri. Siccome poi odio essere sentimentale, lo sono stata abbastanza, e voglio che tutti ti odino, cos\u00ec che nessuno compri i tuoi libri e si legga le cose che hai scritto a me, io ti saluto Frank. ...Grazie ...more 4 estrellas, ya que es de esos libros que empiezas a leer y no esperas mucho de \u00e9l...

One thing that was nice about it was that it was a memoir that happened to be about a period in his life when he was a teacher -- i.e. that happened to be about teaching. It clearly wasn't a \"teacher memoir\" in the traditional sense. McCourt came off as a compelling teacher, because he is almost certainly a compelling storyteller and a compelling person to listen to. It was clear he did some good things in his classroom. But, to me at least, he didn't seem as annoyingly perfect or pedantic as other teachers I read in teacher school. He also (refreshingly) refuses to analyze or justify many of his most compelling (and strange) moments of pedagogy. There were almost certainly students who were ill-served by McCourt and who couldn't stand him. There were also years when I imagine he wasn't a very good teacher. And, of course, there were surely many students he made a great impact on and many more who dearly loved him. In the end what drove this forward was the mixture of classic teacher-man stories (think Dead Poet Society) and McCourt's brisk, snappy sections of teacher/student dialog. I guess I also fundamentally share McCourt's main teaching insight, which is that it's hard to represent \"the system\", that it makes sense when kids resist authority and that often you most sympathize (and even like) the very kids you have to reprimand for wasting the class's time. ...more i hated this book. i didn't like the style of his writing. i didn't like the way he talked about his teaching and what he did in his classroom. as i kept on reading, i was just like- dude- you are not a good teacher. but maybe it's just the way he presented himself. when i got to the end, i was like- so. what was the point? but i guess the point was that this is part of his life story. I read this book years ago, at the start of my teaching career. I can't remember if I was student teaching or if it was my first year, but nevertheless, I was a newbie. I actually started reading it again forgetting this was the Frank McCourt book I had read years ago.

I actually started reading it again forgetting this was the Frank McCourt book I had read years ago. It took me about two pages to realize my mistake, but I figured I might as well finish it since I hadn't even remembered I had read it in the first place. McCourt no doubt has some questionable pedagogy. Some of his out-of-the-box lessons are clever while others are downright ridiculous. He wrote he felt guilty not sticking to the curriculum, but I suppose sometimes it takes risks to discover gold. I feel a little cheated because we never get to experience a typical day in his classroom...there's no way he had his students reciting recipes every day throughout his decades of teaching. What did a regular day look like? He had to have touched on some of the curriculum throughout the year, but I suppose those stories may not have been as engaging. What I did not appreciate was his manner regarding his marriage. He nonchalantly writes about cheating on his wife, claiming that it was a marriage doomed from the start. Ummm, when did that make it okay to have affairs? And, what are these stories adding to this book? The best part about the book is the stories about students and their lives. I tell my students \"teachers are people, too!\" but maybe we sometimes forget that the same applies to our students. We see them in a bubble and make judgments based on their attentiveness in our class and their homework completion and perceived effort, but they have home lives and struggles, just like us. Oh sure, with the \"troubled\" kids, you can clearly see that there are outside forces pulling them from being a motivated student, but what about the others? I sometimes get jealous that other teachers get to know more about their students' outside worlds. English teachers have papers, art teachers see their pieces rife with emotion, religion teachers have journals...what about math teachers? We get to see word problems. It's hard to start deep, provocative discussions around the topic \"how to solve for x\" ...more The first chapter of this book is so exquisite that I have caught myself rehearsing it as a possible public reading many times.

I read the book for the first time shortly after it was published, at the end of my first year as a teacher, and identified with Mr. McCourt's predicament completely. If only I had managed to respond to my situation with the humanity and wisdom he brought to his! Throughout this memoir, Mr. McCourt shares one anecdote after another to paint vivid pictures of the wonderfully idiomatic students he engaged over the years. For many of these students, school as it is structured in modern America is largely disconnected from the rest of what comprises their reality. As they are unable to draw a connection between school and that reality, they see no path through school to a better life, and they exercise apparently sound economic decision making by allocating minimal effort. Mr. McCourt's efforts to help students find a path through education to a better future were instructional and inspirational. This is a book that often comes up when teachers are together discussing their calling. It paints a true picture of modern urban schools and provides relevant and important information about the challenges we face when we are called to \"leave no child behind.\" The book can be an inspiration to those who teach in urban settings and a source of new understanding for those who puzzle at today's debate on education in America. ...more A very different book to Angela\u2019s Ashes. It\u2019s like listening to a witty, self-deprecating yet passionate man tell you stories of his life. You can even hear his accent.

So I smiled when I came to this line in Teacher Man\u201a \u201cSusan Gilman never raises her hand. Everything is too urgent.\u201d The other thing that appealed to me throughout this book is his clear belief in firing young minds with the value of imagination. He loved sharing his enthusiasm for literature and writing, and it\u2019s evident from these pages that he was a terrific teacher. This is a gentle read, filled with quietly emotional moments which make you smile, nod and choke up.

Teacher Man is not all about teaching as it tells of how he lives in New York before accidentally becoming a teacher. Anyone who's ever been in a classroom and especially teachers will 'enjoy' his descriptions of being in a room with a group of kids who would rather eat dirt than listen to him. But he succeeds through his having 'kissed the Blarney Stone' and tells tales (mostly true) of his life. This is my favourite of Frank McCourt's books.

The third section returns to and wraps up his teaching career. It should be the climax, I guess, except that this is more memoir than novel, but what it really is, is too swift. The quotes on the back cover say Teacher Man is the best in McCourt's trilogy (meaning it supposedly surpasses the Pullitzer Prize-winning Angela's Ashes ). Now, I have not read the two previous memoirs, but if McCourt's too-brief conclusion to Teacher Man leaves me hanging after one 250-page book, I have to wonder if I wouldn't have liked it even less if it were the capper to THREE 250-page books. Still, Teacher Man is impossible not to recommend. ...more I do not like this book. I thought, \"He's a teacher, I'm a teacher.

I admit I got the two brothers mixed up, but this book set me straight. Both of them are funny and incredibly talented. Even without the author\u2019s voice reading the book aloud, you can hear the Irish brogue just from the writing. The laughs begin right away, too. As a young, inexperienced teacher, Mr. McCourt has a sandwich thrown at him on his very first day of class. Establishing control is the bane of many a teacher, and Mr. McCourt has mere seconds to show what kind of teacher he is going to be. Will he be strict and yell at the kid? Will he ignore it and be perceived as weak? Actually, he does neither. His reaction is so off-beat, he takes the kids completely by surprise and wins them over. In so doing, he wins over his readers, too. The rest of the book chronicles his growth as a teacher. He starts off at a vocational school with unmotivated students who need discipline and ends up at the elite Stuyvesant High School where the students demand quality teaching. Along the way, he reminisces about his childhood in Ireland and tells us about his failed marriage and brief return to the Old Country. Another Goodreader didn\u2019t like the dips into McCourt\u2019s personal life and wishes the book would have just stayed in the classroom. I can see the point, certainly about the failed marriage, which was the least interesting part of the book. But his pre-teaching days, particularly the overly strict Catholic education and the years spent working the docks, gave the book context. He was successful with his working class students, including some of the Stuyvesant students, because they knew he came from a world similar to theirs. The Stuyvesant section was definitely my favorite part, not just because he had mastered his style as a teacher by then but because he was teaching creative writing. He may have written Angela\u2019s Ashes first, but some of the hints to its origins are in this book. Since I dream of teaching and writing, it was inevitable that I\u2019d like this book, but Frank McCourt is such a skilled storyteller, I think anyone would like it. Then again, he says all of us are writers anyway. Perhaps we\u2019re all teachers, too. ...more Non \u00e8 cos\u00ec appassionante e coinvolgente come Le ceneri di Angela , ma lo stile \u00e8 ugualmente molto scorrevole, con la solita vena di ironia; l'ho letto tutto d'un fiato, nonostante sia un racconto non unitario, ma un succedersi di tanti episodi legati comunque tra loro dalla vita di insegnante di McCourt.

In tutto questo mondo McCourt si trova coinvolto sempre in prima persona e io stessa, come insegnante, mi sono lasciata coinvolgere, ritrovandomi a volte ad arrabbiarmi per la poca convinzione di McCourt nel suo lavoro, per la sua indolenza, ma altre volte a condividerne gli obiettivi, considerando ogni alunno un pezzo unico da rispettare e anche amare e sempre comunque ho invidiato le sue grandi qualit\u00e0 di \"affabulatore\". Insomma, ho vissuto allegramente, dall'inizio alla fine, sensazioni contrastanti che mi hanno portato, in definitiva, anche a giudicare me stessa, pur riconoscendo di non aver mai dovuto affrontare, per mia fortuna, situazioni altrettanto complicate. ...more Almost As Good As \"Angela's Ashes\" McCourties of the world rejoice! You have nothing to lose but your tears of woe anticipating when he'd return with his next book; the foremost memoirist of our time is back. Frank McCourt's \"Teacher Man\" is a spellbinding lyrical ode to the craft of teaching. It is a rollicking, delightful trek across nearly thirty years in New York City public school classrooms that will surely please his devout legion of fans, and perhaps win some new admirers too. Truly, with Almost As Good As \"Angela's Ashes\" McCourties of the world rejoice! You have nothing to lose but your tears of woe anticipating when he'd return with his next book; the foremost memoirist of our time is back. Frank McCourt's \"Teacher Man\" is a spellbinding lyrical ode to the craft of teaching. It is a rollicking, delightful trek across nearly thirty years in New York City public school classrooms that will surely please his devout legion of fans, and perhaps win some new admirers too. Truly, without question, it is a splendid concluding volume in his trilogy of memoirs that began in spectacular fashion with \"Angela's Ashes\". Indeed, we find much of the same plain, yet rather poetic, prose and rich dark humor that defines his first book, along with his undiminished, seemingly timeless, skill as a mesmerizing raconteur. Is McCourt truly now one of the great writers of our time if he isn't already, with the publication of \"Teacher Man\"? I will say only that he was a marvellous teacher (I still feel lucky to have been a prize-winning student of his.), and that this new memoir truly captures the spirit of what it was like to be a student in his classroom. \"Teacher Man\" opens with a hilarious Prologue that would seem quite self-serving if written by someone other than Frank McCourt, in which he reviews his star-struck existence in the nine years since the original publication of \"Angela's Ashes\". In Part I (It's a Long Road to Pedagogy) he dwells on the eight years he spent at McKee Vocational High School in Staten Island. It starts, promisingly enough, with him on the verge of ending his teaching career, just as it begins in the lawless Wild West frontier of a McKee classroom (I was nearly in stitches laughing out loud, after learning why he was nearly fired on two consecutive days, no less.). Frank manages to break every rule learned in his Education courses at New York University, but he succeeds in motivating his students, raising the craft of excuse note writing to a high literary art. He finds time too to fall in love with his first wife, Alberta Small, and then earn a M. A. degree in English from Brooklyn College. Part II (Donkey on a Thistle) has the funniest tale; an unbelievable odyssey to a Times Square movie theater with Frank as chaperone to an unruly tribe of thirty Seward Park High School girls. But before we get there, we're treated to a spellbinding account of his all too brief time as an adjunct lecturer of English at Brooklyn's New York Community College, and of another short stint at Fashion Industries High School, where he receives a surprising, and poignant, reminder from his past. Soon Frank will forsake high school teaching, sail off to Dublin, and enroll in a doctoral program at Trinity College, in pursuit of a thesis on Irish-American literature. But, that too fails, and with Alberta pregnant, he accepts an offer to become a substitute teacher at prestigious Stuyvesant High School (The nation's oldest high school devoted to the sciences and mathematics; its alumni now include four Nobel Prize laureates in chemistry, medicine and economics; for more information please look at my ABOUT ME section, or at history at www.stuy.edu or famous alumni at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High... or Notables at www.ourstrongband.org .). Surprisingly, Part III (Coming Alive in Room 205) is the shortest section of \"Teacher Man\". After having spent fifteen years teaching at Stuyvesant High School, you'd think that this would be this memoir's longest section, replete with many tales rich in mirth (Room 205, located a few doors from the principal's office, was Frank's room throughout his years teaching full-time at Stuyvesant High School.). Indeed I'm surprised that it is so brief. Yet there is still ample fodder for Frank's lyrical prose to dwell on, most notably a hilarious episode on cookbooks and how he taught his creative writing class to write recipes for them. He describes with equal doses of hilarity and eloquence, his unique style of teaching at Stuyvesant, which he compares and contrasts with math teachers Philip Fisher and Edward Marcantonio - the dark and good sides of Stuyvesant mathematics education in the 1970s and 1980s (I was a student of both and will let the reader decide who was my teacher while I was a student in Frank's creative writing class.) - but he still implies that his students were having the most fun. Will \"Teacher Man\" earn the same critical acclaim bestowed upon \"Angela's Ashes\"? Who knows? Is it deserving of it? I think the answer is a resounding yes. Regardless, Frank's many devout fans - his flock of McCourties - will cherish this book as yet another inspirational tale from the foremost memoirist of our time. (EDITORIAL NOTE 7/22/09: Elsewhere online I posted this tribute to my favorite high school teacher, and I think it is worth noting here: I've been fortunate to have had many fine teachers in high school, college and graduate school, but there was no one like Frank McCourt. Without a doubt, he was the most inspirational, most compelling, and the funniest, teacher I ever had. I am still grateful to him for instilling in me a life-long love of literature and a keen interest in writing prose. Am still amazed that he encouraged me to enter a citywide essay contest on New York City's waterfront, and would, more than a year later, in my senior yearbook acknowledge my second prize award by thanking me for winning him money (His was also, not surprisingly, the most eloquent set of comments I had inscribed in my yearbook from teachers.). He is gone now, but I am sure that for me, and for many of my fellow alumni of his Stuyvesant High School classes, he will live in our hearts and minds for the rest of our lives.)

His pedagogy involves the students taking responsibility for their own learning, especially in his first school, McKee Vocational and Technical High School, in New York. On the first day he nearly gets fired for eating a sandwich, and the second day he nearly gets fired for joking that in Ireland, people go out with sheep after a student asks them if Irish people date. Much of his early teaching involves telling anecdotes about his childhood in Ireland, which were covered in his earlier books Angela's Ashes and 'Tis. He then taught English as a Second Language and took some African American students to a production of Hamlet. He talks about when he was training as a teacher and didn't know anything about George Santayana, but was able to give a well-prepared lesson on the war poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Other highlights include his connection between how a pen works and how a sentence works (in explaining subjects and grammar, an area which he struggled with himself) and his use of resources like the students' excuse notes and cookbooks. He taught from the time he was twenty-seven and continued for thirty years. He spent most of his teaching career at Stuyvesant High School, where he taught English and Creative Writing. He earned a Teacher of the Year award in 1976. During the time of the book he went to Trinity College to try to take his doctorate, but he ended up leaving his first wife because of the strain. McCourt's self-deprecating style emerges in descriptions of his shyness, lack of self-esteem, shame at gaps in his education, negative descriptions of his physical appearance, social ineptitude, jealousy when women with whom he has slept promptly leave him for other men, difficulties in his marriage, and a brief period of psychoanalytic treatment. These failures are compensated by successes, albeit often grudging and incomplete, in the classroom.

Hearing the author made it even better the second time around. His accent is great, and his sense of humor comes through better on the audio. A couple times, as he tells a story, he chuckles, and it's so great I had to rewind to hear it again. I enjoyed reading about Frank McCourt's time in the classrooms of New York. Of course I've read Angela's Ashes, and I read his brother Malachy's autobiography, I knew Mr. McCourt had become a teacher. I STILL found this painful reading; this is Frank McCourt and his past is present in his writing, in fact he spends quite a bit of classroom time talking about his miserable Irish childhood. He tells us he talks about it, he doesn't actually spend very much book time talking about it. But the subje I enjoyed reading about Frank McCourt's time in the classrooms of New York.

But the subject tends to fascinate his students, and the kids enjoy storytelling more than they like school assignments. So even as Frank McCourt entertains us with his stories of teaching in New York high schools, he also tells of us his insecurities and self-criticism, his failures and his sins. All of that self-recrimination rang in me like a struck bell. Frank McCourt is funny, successful, he is a survivor. This book didn't hurt as bad as Angela's Ashes, I cried for about a month with that one, but still; I am feeling pain and I don't want to. I suppose there must be some pain in me that matches with the pain in Frank McCourt that is causing this resonating vibrato of pain. The book is certainly not all sorrow; as I said, he is funny and really is a masterful teacher in a non-traditional manner. I think his students were fortunate to have him as a teacher and he was fortunate to have them as students. ...more Aunque a veces tiene un humor demasiado amargo (o adulto) y presuntuoso... sigue siendo un libro casi excelente.

No es mentira que dar una clase suele ser una lucha y, en palabras del autor, no porque los alumnos sean malos, sino que porque son humanos y se aburren y adem\u00e1s son muchos, mientras que el profe es solo uno, solitario frente al aula.

Mal, McCourt. Se aprecia que fueses sincero, pero... bueno, a veces las personas queremos creer que el g\u00e9nero humano es mejor que eso y etc\u00e9tera. En palabras m\u00e1s directas: qu\u00e9 onda t\u00fa (l\u00e9ase con profundo tono reprobatorio). Sin embargo, en conclusi\u00f3n y de todas formas, me pareci\u00f3 un libro BUEN\u00cdSIMO. Una joya de veridismo, en especial para los profesores y escrito, en general, con mucha gracia. Se nota la experiencia de tantos a\u00f1os en aula, el dramatismo a\u00f1adido y practicado que uno aprende en clases para mantener la atenci\u00f3n del \"p\u00fablico\". Se nota el ojo aguzado. Y se nota el afecto. ...more I read Teacher Man on a whim. I read Angela's Ashes seemingly in a past life, and scarcely remember much of it. Did he throw up his communion wafers, & did the priest chastise him for rejecting the body of Christ? And do I remember him having to lick it up? Was there also some closing section that involved the long death of a sweetheart to tuberculosis, or am I confusing that with Van Morrison's \"T.B. Sheets\"?

Was there also some closing section that involved the long death of a sweetheart to tuberculosis, or am I confusing that with Van Morrison's \"T.B. Sheets\"? Teacher Man doesn't demand extensive knowledge of Frank McCourt's other two memoirs, and could easily stand as its own work. McCourt records his experiences in education - trying to get a job, trying to get certified, getting advanced degrees, realizing he's not good, realizing he might be good, and finally realizing that maybe the job he was half-heartedly doing was his calling. McCourt is unusually honest, and unsentimental, about the experience of teaching. I'm pretty tired of the Dead Poets' Society version of teaching - where you tear the pages out of the book, where each kid is a romantic poet waiting to be born out of the welter of adolescence. McCourt describes the fears every classroom teacher has - can I keep control? What will they do next? What if I run out of things to do with them? How do I win over a kid that wants to fight me? How do I manage to discuss personal & intimate things with these confused people, and yet maintain the right boundaries? He talks a lot about the anxieties of teaching, and the rewards, but he also spends a surprising amount of time talking about his personal relationships - his girlfriends, his wife, his mentors. It was refreshing to see a teacher that didn't retreat to a cat-laden apartment and tend the mould growing on his personality. Years and years of treating children as a fragile endangered species have restricted who you're allowed to be as a teacher. According to this idea, you should especially avoid being yourself. But McCourt shows that there's no way to teach without using personal experience. And most of all, you can't show kids how to know something without knowing who you are. I would've liked to have seen more of his classroom dilemmas - perhaps selfishly, because I want to see how someone else solves them. McCourt is right - when you're teaching, the classroom has little to do with pedagogical theories or trends. It's relationships between individuals. And there's nowhere to hide. ...more i'm fascinated, as usual by the negative reviews of this book. ive never read anything that spoke to me about teaching the way this book did, and about the rest of the stuff we're all to deal with in general. perhaps the people who dont get it arent rebels at heart...perhaps they are individuals who havent had a boss scold them or perhaps theyve just always felt in control. but i am grateful for this book, and moreso for frank mc court writing about everything he chose to detail in all three, an i'm fascinated, as usual by the negative reviews of this book. ive never read anything that spoke to me about teaching the way this book did, and about the rest of the stuff we're all to deal with in general. perhaps the people who dont get it arent rebels at heart...perhaps they are individuals who havent had a boss scold them or perhaps theyve just always felt in control. but i am grateful for this book, and moreso for frank mc court writing about everything he chose to detail in all three, angela's ashes, tis, and teacher man with the voice with which he chose to portray them - humor. its humor, its all humor, which apparently some people didnt get... im sure we all gravitate towards books that speak about our own experiences and from our own view point. so other than not being irish, ive dealt with alcholic loved ones, and being misunderstood and fired at work, and mostly, teaching the hardest population to teach, which i do in juvenile hall and camp in los angeles. after wondering about how long it was going to be so hard...i found my copy of teacher man and skimmed through it - there it was, the scene about what you find in the classroom with the doo-whoppers in the back of the room singing...as nowadays we have \"rappers\" who not only constantly rap, but beat on the desk. and of course my favorite, the story of the sandwich on his first day, AND getting scolded by the principal, AND then bonding with his students over it. exactly which part of this book didn't people get? and condescending it certainly IS NOT. I LOVE YOU FRANK MC COURT, FOR GIVING ME PEACE OF MIND AND REMINDING ME THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS, ALWAYS WALK INTO THAT CLASSROOM WITH MY SENSE OF HUMOR IN TACT. Any teacher who walks in the room with out one, well you might think you are a \"grand\" teacher, but in the end, the best teachers are the ones who simply love their students, therefore love being a teacher. especially an english teacher because the meaning is always more important than the spelling or punctuation... ...more Such a great and satisfying book for where I'm at right now.

What I loved: His honesty. It has been so long since I read his first two that I forgot how much I love his writing style. But especially applied to the crucible of teaching, it was just exactly what I needed. He lays it out in a very refreshing way. What I learned: That I'm not alone. That it's just the nature of the beast to never feel completely sufficient for the task. A favorite passage: I didn't always love teaching. I was out of my depth. You're on your own in the classroom, one man or woman facing five classes every day, five classes of teenagers. One unit of energy against one hundred and seventy-five units of energy, one hundred and seventy-five ticking bombs. And you have to find ways of saving your own life. They may like you, they may even love you, but they are young and it is the business of the young to push the old off the planet. I know I'm exaggerating but it's like a boxer going into the ring or a bullfighter into the arena. You can be knocked out or gored and that's the end of your teaching career. But if you hang on you learn the tricks. It's hard but you have to make yourself comfortable in the classroom. You have to be selfish. The airlines tell you if oxygen fails you are to put on your mask first, even if your instinct is to save the child. ...more In Teacher Man, Frank McCourt relates his thirty-five year experiences as a classroom English teacher. He tells it in a straightforward simplistic style that lets the reader gain insight into what many classroom teachers in inner city schools face, teaching five classes of thirty-five students from diverse backgrounds, dealing with all the other things that are required in addition to teaching. His first days as a new teacher he becomes victim of his storytelling prowess. It doesn\u2019t take long fo In Teacher Man, Frank McCourt relates his thirty-five year experiences as a classroom English teacher. He tells it in a straightforward simplistic style that lets the reader gain insight into what many classroom teachers in inner city schools face, teaching five classes of thirty-five students from diverse backgrounds, dealing with all the other things that are required in addition to teaching. His first days as a new teacher he becomes victim of his storytelling prowess. It doesn\u2019t take long for his students to use this as a way to distract him from the lessons he is prepared to teach. He tells them of his life in Ireland; his problems in school, and the jobs he held before becoming a teacher. He relates to them and their parents and the students open up to him. Still he discovers ways to get through to the students on whatever level they happen to be. Since he teaches in a vocational school, most of his students are not going to college. He encounters problems with some of the administrators at the schools where he teachers. He gets his masters in English and gets a position as an adjunct lecturer at Brooklyn Community College. Instead of five classes of English each day, he teaches five classes each week. \u201cI am in Heaven,\u201d though his salary is cut in half. This lasts a year. He goes back to teaching high school. Through the years he learns much. This is an engaging autobiography told with self-deprecating humor and insight. Having been in the trenches, I can relate. ...more Frank McCourt has been a favourite of mine since high school where I read 'Tis and then Angela's Ashes, so when I saw a copy of the final book in his memoirs, I snapped it up, and read it.

In Teacher Man Frank turns his attention to the subject that he most often talks about in his lectures- teaching: why it's so important, why it's so undervalued. He describes his own coming of age - as a teacher, a storyteller and, ultimately, a writer. He is alternately humble and mischievous, down-trodden and rebellious. He instinctively identifies with the underdog; his sympathies lie more with students than administrators. It takes him almost fifteen years to find his voice in the classroom, but what's clear in the thrilling pages of Teacher Man is that from the beginning he seized and held his students' attention by telling them memorable stories. With all the wit, charm, irreverence, and poignancy that made Angela's Ashes and 'Tis so universally beloved, Frank McCourt tells his most exhilarating story yet - how he became a writer. ...more This author wrote ANGELA'S ASHES which I have not read, but the title of course intrigued me.

However, when he talks about the suitcase full of papers watching you from the corner (definitely been there and done that). He takes greater chances than I do (as I give tests and quizzes over what kids read). However, I understand his point. I don't see him asking teachers to follow his model (ask kids to like them, etc.) I see him sincerely recounting his thought process. His character flaw (one that I share more than I care to admit) is caring about what kids think of him. There are definite comparisons. There are teachers in the book and in real life who DON'T care what the kids (parents, etc) think of them, and they don't necessarily reach the kids in the same way. Language arts is a different animal than teaching math and history where there are right and wrong answers. We can all read the same poem, believe something is being said (from our own personal experience) and all be right (to a certain extent). \"Why fear the criticism of others when you, yourself, are first out of the critical gate?\" Too close to home sometimes. ...more", "Title": "Teacher Man"},
