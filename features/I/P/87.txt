I certainly did, and it doesn't change the fact that my soul is now a heap of shreds on the floor. Oh, is that melodramatic? I don't care! I can count on one hand the number of books that have made me cry, and this is one of them -- twice, in fact, and a few times afterward. My poor soul! That is not to say that this was a perfect book. I thought the beginning started out rather slowly, so at first I had no trouble sticking to my 50ish-page per day limit as a futile attempt to stave off the inevitable post-book blues. But then, once everyone got to Aslevjal, that idea collapsed and there was no way I was putting the book down until I realized it was one in the morning and the words were swimming before my eyes and I'd stubbornly read the same paragraph five times without comprehending any of it BUT OH MAN (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [the poor Fool had just been chained to a memory stone dragon and sentenced to a slow death by forging so how could I just calmly go to sleep after that?! (hide spoiler) ] . I also thought the ending was too rushed. There was a lot of catchup and reforged (view spoiler) [(or maybe un-Forged) (hide spoiler) ] connections, and a number of events fell into place without Fitz making active choices. Some of the changes in Fitz's character between the two series are made more clear, but I didn't have enough time to adapt to that revelation. It's therefore hard to reconcile the ending with lines like (view spoiler) [\"My dream was dead in my arms.\" That, especially, was a crying line! (hide spoiler) ] The only way I can make sense of it is if I decide that Fitz (view spoiler) [a) refuses to talk about how painful the loss of his truest friend actually is, which is so Fitz, because I do not buy for a Bingtown minute that he's not upset about that; or b) has finally learned to live like a wolf, and therefore chooses to be content in the present; or c) there's something else fishy going on; or d) both a and b; or e) all of the above, and now this is starting to sound like an SAT question (hide spoiler) ] . In any case, I broke down again during the penultimate, pre-epilogue chapter, and cried for (view spoiler) [the fact that Fitz gets the past he wanted -- and yes, still wants -- at the expense of the future (hide spoiler) ] . However, these books also present one of the most complex relationships I've encountered in fiction, with a lot of commentary about relationships, friendship, love, gender, and sex woven in. It would probably take me a few pages to describe it, and there's not really any good solution to the problem. Now I'm flailing around trying to disentangle what the characters think they want, what I think they want, and what they actually want. Basically, I just want everyone to be happy, and I can't figure out how that could ever occur. Damn Burrich and his line about the horse and the two saddles. Final note: line up all three books of this series on your bookshelf and look at them. Then think about how a certain character changes throughout the series.<---F> AWESOME</---F>. ...more All friendships go through rough patches at one time or another, and in this Fitz\u2019s relationship with the Fool is pushed almost to breaking point. Fitz has begun to have doubts, which come from even stronger feelings of fear; he fears for the future, a future that may not correspond with the Fool\u2019s ideas. A dragon lies between then, one Fitz has to slay and one the Fool wishes to save. Friendship becomes the problem and the answer, as Fitz begins to realise that everything that as ever happened All friendships go through rough patches at one time or another, and in this Fitz\u2019s relationship with the Fool is pushed almost to breaking point. Fitz has begun to have doubts, which come from even stronger feelings of fear; he fears for the future, a future that may not correspond with the Fool\u2019s ideas. A dragon lies between then, one Fitz has to slay and one the Fool wishes to save. Friendship becomes the problem and the answer, as Fitz begins to realise that everything that as ever happened to him is because of the Fool\u2019s touch. The Prophet\u2019s Chosen One Fitz is the Fool\u2019s oldest, and perhaps only, friend; he is the only person he has ever granted the knowledge of his true name, but he is also his tool: his catalyst. Fitz may doubt his friend, and ignore his kindness and guidance, but he can\u2019t ignore his power. He has shaped Fit\u2019s future, and he intends to shape the future of the world by resurrecting the remnants of a dying race: the dragons. Fitz can\u2019t realistically stop such an individual; he should stand by his friend always. This is something I can see instantly, but for Fitz, he spends most of the novel trying to realise his stance. Indeed, he has Chade guiding him on the opposite path- he wishes to extinguish the race because, well, they\u2019re dangerous. But so are men. And Fitz is stuck in between the two he loves most dear. However, as frequent readers of the series will know, Fitz will always follow his own mind; this normally changes in the heat of the moment, as the assassin has learnt to adapt the most carefully of laid plans as circumstance warrants. Neither Fitz, The Fool or Chade were fully ready for what awaited them in the dragons lair though. An ending that Fitz deserves? Fitz doesn\u2019t seem to get any real lasting happiness in his life; he has had more than his share of heartache, and it is only going to get worse as the story progresses, so it was wonderful to see him get a glimpse of something at the end of the story. He has sacrificed everything for the Farseer throne, his blood, his youth and even his life have been shed so it seems only appropriate to see him sheath his daggers and hang up his axe even if it is for a short time. This had a great ending, one that allows the story to move even further forward in the future as Hobb allows her protagonist to enter yet another stage of his life. ...more This book. Damn. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time! I haven't been this emotionally affected by a book in years. I cried so many times, which is rare for me. It was perfect. Seriously, reading all of Hobb's books is worth it just to get to this one. Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! So... I don't know how I am supposed to begin writing up a review for this book because never in my whole life have I been as affected and devastated, happy and excited, lonely and angry as I was throughout the adventures of this book.

I don't know how I am supposed to begin writing up a review for this book because never in my whole life have I been as affected and devastated, happy and excited, lonely and angry as I was throughout the adventures of this book. This is my all-time favourite book. It's exceptional. It's leagues ahead of all others (except for The Mad Ship, also by Hobb, which was recently my favourite book... overtaken by another Hobb book!) for so many reasons, and trying to gather my thoughts and rein them in enough to write a cohesive review that not only convinces everyone to read this, but also shows just how special it is to me... it's going to be hard... So, with all of that said, this book was great right from page one. As with all of the Farseer, Tawny Man and Fitz and the Fool books the main characters are once more Fitz, the bastard, and the Fool, a friend of his with some peculiar abilities. This book picks up not too long after the ending of book 2 when we're following Fitz, Chade, the Fool, Dutiful, Thick, the Narcheska and many more characters as they're about to embark on a rather grand quest. This quest is taking place because it will allow the young Prince the chance to prove his worth and slay a great beast, bringing the head back to the Outislander people and sealing an alliance between them. This story IS epic, in all senses of the word. There's big long journeys, there's many different characters, there's magic of various kinds. We get to see creatures in the skies and seas who are mystical and magical. We see journeys through all sorts of terrain and waters (yeah, there's ships - I like ships!). We also get to see a lot more than just a regular epic fantasy because not only does it have all of these elements and more, but it focuses on the characters (it is, after all, by Hobb). Robin Hobb has a way with words. Maybe even more than a way with words. She has an ability to create not only a world which is magic and a wonderful place to escape to, but she can convince me fully about this world. She is one of the few writers I have read where I can visualise all the scenes laid out before me and SEE what is happening as I read the words. The characters that Hobb creates and the scenes of dialogue between them all is fabulous because they make mistakes, they do stupid things, the apologise, they try again, and against all odds they try and get by in this crazy world. She's a master of making the characters become real people who you feel like you know and feel like you understand. She's got an ability to lay down all the words and from them you can draw out a living and breathing world within your head. You can imagine and see it all before you, and you're privy to all the dirty secrets, crude betrayals and strong tragedies and horrors that she unveils. This story took me in from page one and it's fabulous to be able to say that I started at book 1 of the Farseers and have followed these characters through 6 books now (some characters even through more if they've overlapped with those in the Liveship books). I think the change in both Hobb's abilities and the characters as they have grown and evolved as people and as elements in the world has been superb to watch. I have to say that I cannot even think of any way that this book could have been better. Every single one of the many, many storylines, questions and plots that Hobb was juggling she managed to tie off beautifully. I can see why, having read this, so many people (Hobb included) didn't think she'd ever return to this set of characters. That's not to say that this is a Martin book and everyone dies or anything like that, but there are some VERY emotional moments where I was sobbing my heart out (no joke, at least 20 times!) There were also so many moments of joy and happiness, redeeming moments and perfect, thought-provoking speech. Another thing which I adore about Hobb is that she is not afraid of addressing issues. She's got the ability to slide in ideas about gender-equality, race, deformities, sexuality, standing up for things, differing customs and much more. She manages to integrate all of these 'big issue' topics into her books and make them a seamless part of the story, but she doesn't focus on them. The story itself is more about the characters themselves, who they are, what they do and the decisions that they make, but at the same time each of those character have different 'issues' associated with them or as a part of them and we're constantly exposed to these things without even realising it (whether it was her intention or not I don;t know, but she does it very well!). This story was perfection. There are so many moments I want to tell you all about and cry over because thinking back on the read-throguh of this book it was truly wonderful. However, I don't want to spoil anything about it, all I want is for you all to go and enjoy the wonder of Hobb's world yourselves. If you've read this book I have no doubt that you know what it is I adore about her, and if you've not yet read it then please do try something by her, whether you're in for the long haul and you start at Assassin's Apprentice (Farseer #1) or if you just want to dip your toe in to her stuff and start with Ship of Magic (Liveships #1). Either way is a perfect start, but I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I can say with certainty that this is my #1 book I've ever read. 100% highly highly recommended! ...more This series was all set to be my Robin Hobb all time favorite surpassing even Liveship Traders.

The writing is absolutely superb and the world Hobb has created continues to wow me in its complexity. It is a world I wouldn't mind spending forever in. And she has frequently brought me to tears with the beautiful moments she captures between her amazing characters. All that night, I cradled him in my arms, as closely as if he were my child or my lover. As closely as if he were my self, wounded and alone. I held him while he wept, and I held him after his weeping was done. I let him take whatever comfort he could in the warmth and strength of my body. I have never felt less of a man that I did so. If you had asked me at about 80% through I would have said there weren't enough stars on this site for this book. But the ending ruined it for me. Unfortunately the why is a bit of a spoiler, so read under the tag at your own risk. (view spoiler) [ Okay I admit. I've never liked Molly. I know some people do, but I felt she was nothing special, and her frequent pout sessions where she would ignore Fitz drove me crazy. Granted Fitz did hide a lot from her and wasn't exactly honest, something that drove me absolutely nuts about his character. However, she knew going in that he was the King's Man so her getting upset when he was off being the King's Man annoyed me to no end. So I was kind of happy when she wandered off with Burrich. And now Fitz finally admits to Burrich he is alive, and Burrich is back. And it was awesome for a while seeing them together again, Burrich being one of my favorite characters. But Burrich knows that Molly has always loved Fitz and will choose him. Then Hobb removes him from the picture so Fitz and Molly are finally clear to be together. No. Fucking. Way. I thought it was highly inappropriate that one of Fitz first thoughts when Burrich dies is now I can be with Molly. Fuck Molly and fuck you for thinking that first after the man who raised you dies. So he goes about trying to being with Molly/\"fulfill his promise to Burrich to care for his children\" by ignoring the children and trying to pursue Molly. And then bypassing Molly and telling her children who he is and what he meant to their mother in order to gain their affection and approval. NOT OKAY. You do not tell young children that you were your mother's old lover without the mother's consent. Unforgivable. I don't care how fucking desperate you are. THEY ARE NOT YOUR CHILDREN. They are hers and it is her business what she tells them and does not tell them. This as a parent made me absolutely LIVID. So disappointed. (hide spoiler) ] ...more \u00ab Home is people.

Had she not made the relationship between Fitz and the Fool so powerful and moving - I might have been less horrified to see him cast aside so frivolously. The final chapters with Molly felt empty and dull in comparison. Her character seemed petty. Ironically, this has still been one of my favorite fantasy adventures....though I sincerely hope she changes her mind about not continuing the story. I would normally cringe at a series that lasts beyond 3-4 books...but this would be the rare exception. Too much was left incomplete. ...more I was very happy with this series (though I wouldn't recommend anyone read it without reading the Farseer trilogy first). I must have been happy because I read all three books within a week at the cost of many hours of sleep.

I thought the ending of the Farseer trilogy was good as well even though many didn\u2019t find it a very fitting ending because a lot of Fitz\u2019 pain and sacrifice went largely unrewarded and unrecognised. But I think even many of those critics would appreciate the end of this series. Like the last book of the Farseer Trilogy, this book brings us to a dragon-centric quest. An adventure where the hero goes off to slay a dragon. We A good and satisfying ending to what has become my favourite Hobb trilogy.

But I think even many of those critics would appreciate the end of this series. Like the last book of the Farseer Trilogy, this book brings us to a dragon-centric quest. An adventure where the hero goes off to slay a dragon. Well...that would have been a nice story. This story is a little different as Thick points out \u201cAdventure? Puking and eating fishy food? Going up and down, up and down, all the time? Going around people who wonder why I'm not dead?\u201d He crossed his stubby arms on his chest. \u201cI heard adventures in stories. Adventures have golden coins and magic and beautiful girls to kiss. Adventures aren't puking!\u201d Poor Thick. Still, we do eventually get a story of dragons and dragon slayers and dragon savers and heroes and beautiful girls to kiss. However, again, most of the dramatic tension and climaxes are found in Fitz' navigation of his relationships and personal identity, more so than the larger events. The quests and physical action climax well before the end of the book but that doesn\u2019t mean all the drama is finished. You may well still find yourself biting your nails and peeking through your fingers as Hobb brings all Fitz\u2019 chickens home to roost. By now, Fans of the Fitz and Fool novels have come to expect that Hobb will treat Fitz harshly \u2013 and that there is no guarantee that he will get rewarded and recognised for every or even any good deed. Many may ask with a knowing grimace, \u201cis this a happily ever after kind of story?\u201d I would probably have to reply...of a sorts. You may be surprised. I found it very satisfying in any case. So much so that I have to think about how I feel about Hobbs recent announcement of a new Fitz and Fool trilogy in the making. Part of me leaps up at the thought of more stories from our dynamic duo \u2013 but part of me is happy to let things lie as they are \u2013 because I suspect more Fitz and Fool equals more pain, more suffering, more loss. Then again, with all those things come more risk, more love, more life. It would be a bit of an ask though for it to bring more than... 5 stars. ...more Bitter sweetness or sweet bitterness...Epic.

But after I finished the last pages and the understanding that THIS is the end, no more Fool and Fitz relationship for you dear, it all...got on me. And I went to town to buy 3G modem and forgot about the promise given to myself - no computer on vacations!))) I sooo want to share what I felt with fellow-readers) I think I am very lucky to read the Farseer and the Tawny man trilogies as a whole, at once, when all the books were already completed, because if I got a taste of the Fool`s inner world, which he reviels piece by piece during the narration, and collected all the quotes about his attitude towards Fitz and his feelings like precious gems, and had to wait for the final book to come out and THEN got such an ending ... I would probably...I dont even want to think about it!))) Also, I got spoilers and knew that a lot of readers consider the ending not happy at all but a mockery to Fitz and a sacrifise from the Fool. Anf here I join this crowd)))))))) For me reading both sagas was PURE BLISS. I wont elaborate about the complex web of intrigues and beautiful language of Robin Hobb, because lots of critics made high praise and all long before me. I want to talk about the pain which is so GREAT right now, as if I myself have lost a dear friend. I heard a lot of discussions (some of them are pretty hot))))) where fans of the Fool argue about his gender. LOL, people, that is SO not important!! Fool is unique. I don`t have a slightest doubt about his gender, for there are too many hints, I would say - it`s plain as daylight because the answer is right there in the text! Fitz knew him through by Scill, he knew him by Wit, he was inside of his body and he, about whom the Fool had said - \"you know me the best\", never questioned his identity. For Fitz it was NEVER a question. Fool was his friend. But what our dear author makes of their frienship by the end? Fitz, who was partially \"forged\" even then realizes that he can`t live without HIS Fool. They become something way closer relatives, lovers or friends usually are - they really ARE the halves of a whole. No woman ever could give that to Fitz. And I like Molly, I really do))))) She is strong and self sufficient character, a woman knows how to earn respect!))) And she was Fitz`s true and first love, but the key world here - WAS. She is PAST. A wife of another, not a woman in love anymore, no-no!! MOTHER in the first place. Mother of another`s babies. Nothing here belongs to Fitz anymore! I dont get how he doesnt see this((( The Fool brought him back as people say \"the missing pieces of his soul\", but that were the late memories of the past. That girl existed NO more. The woman in NOW is a different person Fitz knows NOTHING about. And lets be honest - Fitz never was her priority - babies, candle-shop and the strong household were. And the Fool? The only one who could UNDERSTAND Fitz, who loved him crazily? Note that he compared himself with Nighteyes - but the Wolf never competed with the female, he knew Fitz needs \"a mate and cubs\" and was OK with it, wheras the Fool says - I have to go because IF I stay you will HAVE to CHOOSE between me and Molly, I wont make this happen, I will sacrifise my love for your happiness. And Fitz? What does he say? Is he happy with another`s wife who doesn`t know ape`s shit about him, except he was a cute boy who f***ed her well once... Is he? He says... I am content. But Fitz was always a bit slow when it came to feelings, so he can decieve himself all he wants, telling it was FAAAATE, and it left no choice for them and now it`s too late... but the truth is simple - he COULD HAVE the brightest gem, the highest of love if he only reached his hand towards what have been offered to him...but... he f**ed it up. And the Fool? He came back with the final poem, revieling his feelings with \"ILOVEYOU but I WILL SACRIFICE MY LOVE for your happiness and walk away\" BUT his last dance of CHANCES smashed me to little ashes! it made me remember the scene where he finds out the flowers he received every morning were not from Fitz. But he kept hoping!!!!! I was never wise... Silly, silly Fitz. It`s not \"a riddle\" - it`s a plain answer to your question \"Who I am to you?\" Because the Fool was the only one who saw and accepted Fitz for what he was and around him Fitz could let himself the most precious thing - BE HIMSELF. Not play a role. How can a person loose THIS feeling and say \" I am content\"?... How can he be honest, when the other part of his soul walked away?... I understand why the author ended the books like THIS: it was logical. For the Fool Fitz is the Alfa and the Omega, the whole Universe. So he sacrifices his feelings to give him \"a life he always dreamed about\". Fitz is a man of duty . So thanks to (easy here, no bad words about the dead, remember?) yes! thanks to Burrich he ends up with another responsibility. (when he was READY to leave with The Fool!!!) But do you believe that THIS is THE END of their Story? I will never be convinced that the Fool and Fitz can be happy apart. It feels like a betrayal. They shall exist - that`s true. But TO LIVE one has to have a heart and a soul - and Fitz`s have walked away from him. What else is there to say except \"I am content?\"... And it HURTS!... Hurts so much... Didn`t they...after all they`ve been through deserve each other? A bitter sweet book, YES! I hope - and hope is this strange thing - when even the author herself tells you that it`s impossible... you keep dreaming that we shall hear from them someday! \"Fitz, I cannot. I was not made for this, this slaughter! This taking of life is not why I came. I have never seen this, not in any dream, nor read of it in any scroll. I fear I may lead time awry.\" \"No. This is right. I feel it. I am the Catalyst, and I came to change all things. Prophets become warriors, dragons hunt as wolves.\" I hardly knew my own voice as I spoke. I had no idea where such words came from. I met the Fool's unbelieving eyes. \"It is as it must be. Go.\" \"He embraced me almost convulsively, and shocked me when he kissed my mouth. He spun and ran toward Girl-on-a-Dragon\". .\"I hope he wears an earring of silver and blue. The fingerprints he left on my wrist have faded to a dusky gray. I think I will always miss him.\" P.C. With LOVE, to Robin Hobb. You are amazing!!!!!!! ...more A letter home - That\u2019s it then, another quest came to an end. Another set of mysteries explained. We went sailing (which Thick was very grateful for) and ice fishing, we made ice castles (though 'labyrinth' would probably cover it better) and we even made a dragon or two fly.

The food wasn't really good either, but luckily I found an abandoned honey jar on the way. As always A letter home - That\u2019s it then, another quest came to an end.

As always, I was in magnificent company though: Fitz is still my favourite, and I feel it important to note that he\u2019s finally growing up and accepting some the responsibilities he refused to take for so long. Really, it was foolish of him to think you can decline your family heritage, or that you can leave people behind for so long without some consequences. I really enjoyed meeting Nettle, though I still think we didn\u2019t see enough of her. Dutiful is becoming wiser every day, I think he\u2019ll make a magnificent king. Then there is Thick, an absolutely wonderful human being, especially when he\u2019s outsmarting the others. They continuously underestimate him, and that\u2019s probably his biggest advantage.

To be honest though, I think this was probably the least of our travels in this world so far.

Somethi Fool's Fate has one of the most satisfying endings I've read in a long time. When I first began Assassin's Apprentice, I thought \"Oh, it's first-person. That's boring. Now I know the main character won't die.\" Well, Hobb taught me that there are far worse things you can do to a character than kill them. After 6 books of Hobb physically and emotionally torturing FitzChivalry, I was very surprised to see an ending like this. It was such an amazing ending. How did I expect the ending to go? Something like this: Fitz living behind the walls of Buckkeep for the rest of his years, watching the ones he loves living a normal life. But it was nothing like that. Let's just say that it was a happy ending. I say this in every review I do for Hobb's novels, but I have to say it again: Robin Hobb is such a gifted writer. Her writing is feels like sitting in front of a hearth with a cup of coffee and a pastry on a cold, winter night. When I realized that a big portion of the book was Fitz sailing on a ship, I thought the book was going to bog down and I would have to force myself to pick it up. Yeah, I should've known that wouldn't be the case. Hobb can even make a simple, long ship ride feel fun. Fool's Fate was filled with so many twists and turns, secrets and drama, and lots of light action. I could barely put it down. I would stay up late through the night reading, not even realizing how late it was. When I realized I was so close to the ending, I could not believe it. I will be leaving the Fitz alone for a few months, because I am afraid of what Robin Hobb has in store for him next. In the words of FitzChivalry Farseer, I am content. ...more So bittersweet. It's going to be hard for any book/series for the rest of the year to top the experience I had with the Tawny Man trilogy. I first read the Farseer trilogy when I was in my mid-teens, roughly Fitz's age through the trilogy. I connected to a lot of his conflicts. I'm now the same age as Fitz during the Tawny Man trilogy, and I think that helped the books resonate with me as an adult.

I'm now the same age as Fitz during the Tawny Man trilogy, and I think that helped the books resonate with me as an adult. I don't think I would have been able to connect with his challenges as a father (in several capacities) if I'd read the book in my 20s. Fitz's growing relationship with the Fool is perfect. It's a complex, romantic, empowering and believable bond between two real people. This is doubly effective since Fitz is a heterosexual man who has to navigate the Fool's labyrinthine feelings (romantic and otherwise) for him. I don't know that I've read any other relationship between non-romantically involved men that revolves singly around their love for one another. (Though, I'm also not sure that the Fool identifies as male. Especially considering the Liveship trilogy. The Fool's personas have genders.) In any case, it's an intricate, vulnerable, brave, and honest relationship that Hobb explores. It'll take time to reflect, but I think Tawny Man is even better than Farseer, which is a modern classic in its own right. Go read it all. ...more What I've come to expect from a Robin Hobb book. That is, it has about twice as many pages as the plot should support, but that's alright. Because the remaining text is filled with essential character development, which is Hobb's greatest strength as a writer. So in that sense, it's a typical book from her. But on the other hand, it's very much its own story, or sub-story of the greater tale of FitzChivalry Farseer.

I am content. Technically I know I should go onto the Rainwild Traders next but there is a certain other Hobb book that is screaming out to me to read me first - Fool's Assassin . And for the first time I will be basically reading her new book 'live' rather than years after the original release. Can't wait to swim in uncharted waters.

Fool\u2019s Fate by Robin Hobb is the culmination of the Tawny Man Trilogy, a trilogy that got better with each book, and ended spectacularly with a lot of feeling. Fool\u2019s Fate is the 9th book in Hobb\u2019s Realm of the Elderling Series and those books need to be read before you read Fool\u2019s Fate. Those trilogies are The Farseer Trilogy and The Liveship Traders Trilogy. This is an epic fantasy series that focuses on characterization and inter-personal relationships with a character that has many secrets from those individual relationships. Talking about the plot of this book would be a large spoiler for what happened in the previous books so I am going to be vague. Fool\u2019s Fate has the Six Duchies people attempting to make a trading partnership with The Out Islander people but the prince of the Six Duchies must find a dragon frozen in ice to signify his worthiness to marry the Out Island princess. Fitz, from the shadows, must be the catalyst that changes events for the betterment of the entire realm. There is a lot of court characters and plotlines that run through multiple character. Hobb\u2019s focus is on the inter-personal relationships that Fitz has. This book was just fantastic in every way. This is a trilogy that got better with each book, like a trilogy should do. The first book, Fool\u2019s Errand, caught the reader and Fitz up with what is happening in the Six Duchies, and keeping secrets. The second book, Golden Fool, saw Fitz try to control other people and seeing his secrets unravel. In this last book, Fool\u2019s Fate, we see Fitz finally succumbing to his fate, and letting his secrets go. Fitz is much more mature in this trilogy than the Farseer Trilogy and that makes him a more dynamic character. It is nice to read a group of books centered around a middle aged man instead of a teenager. The main focus of this trilogy is really inter-personal relationships and following a character that finally learns how to deal with his inter-personal relationships. There are a lot of secrets that could be deadly to know about. People in Fitz\u2019 life are happy and if they knew the truth they might get hurt, so Fitz holds back a lot of the truth from his friends. Why this book and this series is so enjoyable is because we see the unraveling of all these secrets that Fitz holds from about a dozen other characters. Each person has a completely different relationship to Fitz, a varying degree of relationship. Based off of the level of their relationship, they know only certain things about Fitz. When the secrets or the hard decisions come up, these relationships are strained, causing great drama. The highlight of this book and the entire trilogy is Fitz\u2019 relationship with The Fool. Their dynamic is the best dynamic in the entire series and their friendship is such an interesting thing to read about. There are so many dynamics to their relationship that makes each decision seem like something that holds the weight of the world on their shoulders. If you are looking for a series of fantasy books that has one of the best friendships ever written, check these books out. I loved this book because I felt so many emotions while reading this. After you read so many books about the same characters, there are these moments of interaction that you have been waiting for so many pages of text to see, so when it finally happens it is unbelievably moving. This was such an up and down emotional journey and a lot of these emotional sequences are happening during scenes of action and extreme plot development. In other words, I read scenes that were really exciting to only have this huge emotional response, but thrown right back into the excitement, and it was amazing. This happened a multiple of times and I love the ride that Hobb took me on. 5/5 23/25 Possible Score Plot \u2013 4(Strong) Characters \u2013 5(Very Strong) Setting/World Building \u2013 4(Strong) Writing Style \u2013 5(Very Strong) Heart & Mind Aspect \u2013 5(Very Strong) ...more In three words: tense, heartbreaking, emotional. \"An accumulation of small acts can change the world.\" When I started reading the Tawny Man trilogy, people warned me that it would be sad but that the pain would be worth it.

Now I've finished, I can definitely see what they mean! My emotions were all over the place during the last half or so of this book. So many things happened. SO MANY FEELS. To backtrack a little, having read the Farseer trilogy and the Liveship Traders trilogy, this is the third trilogy I've read by Robin Hobb and, again, she does not disappoint with the last book. I think, in terms of writing, Liveship Traders is still my favourite, but the characters in Farseer and Tawny Man are just so, so dear to me. When bad things happen to them, it kills me. And bad things do happen in this book, some of them so horrific that it hurt to read. While *that* event in Fool's Errand broke my heart, the events in this book shattered it and then (partly) mended it again. Hobb's characters have a way of really affecting me, and it just shows what an amazing writer she is. While there are familiar characters in this series (for those who have read the Farseer and Liveship Traders trilogies, at least), there are lots of great new ones as well. Hobb's character development is second to none, and I loved reading a more mature Fitz's view. With regard to pacing, the first part of the book was a bit slow, but things really picked up near the middle and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the remainder of the story. The world Hobb has created continues to amaze me and I cannot wait to read more of her books (as well as reread the ones I've read!). Recommended for: people who love fantasy or just amazingly well-written characters in general. This book in particular will make you smile and laugh and cry and just basically feel all the emotions. (Note: If you're new to reading Hobb's books, I would start with the Farseer trilogy, then Liveship Traders, then Tawny Man!) ~~~~~ Review also posted here . ...more Overall impression is one big disappointment.

I've savored this book over the last 3-4 months, partly to prolong the experience but also for fear of running out of great fantasy to read. I started the series out of lack of anything else to read, and then continued it as something to hold me over until George R.R. Martin could finish the 5th book in his \"Song of Ice and Fire\" series. This is probably the best compliment I can pay to Robin Hobb, that I find her fantasy on par with that of George R.R. Martin (quite possibly the greatest writer of epic fantasy I've ever read). This series has much of the qualities of Martin's series, but with a bit softer edges. I can't really say anything about this final installment I haven't already said about the previous 2 books in the trilogy. Its fantastic. The use of magical elements in it are subtle and precise, not hamfisted and blunt as in much of epic fantasy today. Too often epic fantasy is more about magical powers than about people, this book and Hobb's others are a welcome change of pace. They are more works of literature than much else I've read in the fantasy genre. I am just not sure what else to say. Read this series, it will astound you. If you are a veteran of the fantasy genre and know it well, you can start with this trilogy for Hobb is very good at exposition about previous happenings (yet the exposition feels natural and infered not tacked on and extenporanious(sp?)). If you are new to fantasy and want a truly great read, start with the \"Farseer Trilogy\" and then move onto the \"Liveship Traders Trilogy\" and finally onto this trilogy the \"The Tawny Man\". I found it interesting to start a trilogy about someone with a past. It was nice to start an epic fantasy with someone who already had experiences and a past. Too often all stories start and end in such an ordered and, sometimes, mundane fashioned way. So check this out. I give it my stamp of approval. ...more Realms of the Elderlings , third series done and it\u2019s getting better and better.

Full Review: As the year draws to a close, I look back on 9 books I read in the last 4 months by Robin Hobb. Books I might never have read if not for good reads. This book caps off 3 stand alone trilogy that's by themselves are excellent. You can't really read Tawny Man without reading Farseer, but I suppose you could read Liveship without reading Farseer and many people have said their is no need to read Liveship before Tawny man. To that I say why? Why would you deprive yourself of great books for one. For another this book once again strengthens my belief that you do yourself a disservice by skipping Liveship. While I can imagine you won't be confused without reading it, you certainly miss out on a lot of the back story and significance of certain things. I had not expected to finish all 9 books this year, but once I finished my December book club pick with most of the month left, I resolved to read the whole Tawny Man trilogy before what stands to be a very busy reading year in 2013. I'm glad I did. It was a great way to cap off the year in between all the holiday busyness finding time here and there to read. Ms. Hobb found a way to resolve things in satisfying manner while still leaving me with a few questions that I'm OK with not having answers to. Sometimes speculating is the best part of a good book. That way the book never truly ends. Before coming to this trilogy I've read people who have clamored for more Fitz and the Fool books by Ms. Hobb. Her most recent entries in the Eldering series ( Rain Wild Chronicles ) which takes place at the same time as this series apparently contain neither. I expect I will read that series, but plan to take a break before doing so. I would happily read another book with those characters if done right.

But, since you are here, for whatever reason, I\u2019ll make it short and just let you know that Fool\u2019s Fate met, and maybe even exceeded, my very high expectations\u2026 which I knew it would because I read it ten years ago and have thought about it longingly in all the years since. This time I listened to Brilliance Audio\u2019s recently released audio version which was superbly narrated by James Langton who is now, for me, the official voice of FitzChivalry Farseer. I absolutely adored his performance. The story begins just where it left off in Golden Fool. Fitz is back at court, acting as Skillmaster and somewhat of a father figure for Prince Dutiful. The prince has gotten himself in a sticky situation \u2014 he impulsively accepted his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s challenge to behead a giant dragon entrapped in a glacier. Not quite believing that such a thing actually exists, he sets off with his retinue (including Fitz) to do the deed. Fitz is concerned about what they\u2019ll find when they arrive because the Fool seems to think that this event is the culmination of his life\u2019s work and that his death is imminent. That plot summary (and even the title of the book) makes it sound like Fool\u2019s Fate is just another silly fantasy quest, but the quest, though it is integrally tied in with Hobb\u2019s other work in LIVESHIP TRADERS and THE RAIN WILD CHRONICLES is mostly a vehicle for Hobb to give us both an epic tragedy and an epic love story. That\u2019s what she\u2019s so good at \u2014 giving us characters who we care deeply about. These people feel almost like family and we\u2019re with them as they navigate the entire spectrum of human experiences. Each of Hobb\u2019s protagonists goes through much pain, sorrow, and defeat, but each of them loves deeply and the pain makes that love even more beautiful. The story is powerfully emotional and few readers will come away with dry eyes. As I\u2019ve said in previous reviews, the FARSEER and TAWNY MAN trilogies are, in my opinion, the best that fantasy literature has to offer and my first recommendation for friends who ask me what they should read. Though I\u2019ve read thousands of fantasy novels, these remain my favorites. It surprised me this year when Robin Hobb gave us Fool\u2019s Assassin, the first in a new trilogy about Fitz and the Fool. I didn\u2019t need it \u2014 I thought that Fool\u2019s Fate was a perfect stopping place \u2014 but I\u2019ll be happy to see my old friends again. http://www.fantasyliterature.com/revi... ...more [This review may contain some spoilers, though I try to avoid mentioning anything momentous in the plot, if you see [SPOILER] immediately stop reading my review if you have not read the book] This book is one of the most emotionally powerful books I have ever read.

I'm a man, and like many men, we take pride in the masculine stereotype of withholding tears even from extremely emotional moments. I couldn't do that when reading this book. This book, unlike the many so-called \"tragic\" movies I've seen managed to get me shedding a few tears at the few tragic moments at the end of book. First off, I would not say this is perfect. Hobb's handling of the plot is much better than the completely crappy ending of the first trilogy (The Farseer Trilogy), but it's still weak in the endings department. Her immense strength has always lied in her genius in creating amazingly realistic characters (they are the farthest from Mary/Gary Stu's I've ever seen, yet unlike many authors, she doesn't just make them stupid and nasty all the time, the opposite of a Mary Stu) who you come to love, and interesting non-cliche worlds. I have always loved the \"Skill\" magic system, it's powerful, but not god-like. Using it risks the wielder's sanity and as we have seen, often taxes Fitz greatly to use. It's a magic that can only be mastered through immense discipline and practice, rather than just \"finding-your-center\" type exercises most books use to explain the main characters sudden mastery of magic. The healing use of the Skill in this book used a very acceptable pseudo-scientific explanation, rather than just automagically fixing someone, the user must completely (or near completely) understand the anatomy of the wounded area, and when the magic is used, it does not simply fix the area, but accelerates the body's healing process (as well as guiding it), but at the cost of quite a lot of energy on the wounded persons part. The characters, especially the Fool have been greatly expanded over the duration of the Tawney Man Trilogy. This was a series that should never been split from the \"Farseer Trilogy\", as characters that were once completely two-dimensional grow to become almost real, and the reader loves them. The Fool went from simply being a Jester that followed Fitz around to a rich character, little bits of his past was given to the reader, as well as a more detailed opinion of himself. We see that the Fool has many \"facets\" of his personality, some completely different genders. The most pivotal thing that has gradually been revealed since the last book in the Farseer Trilogy up until Fool's Fate, is that he is in love with Fitz. While Fitz considers the Fool to be his closest friend (the highest relationship with a man that Fitz can conceive of), the Fool loves him with all of his heart. I am completely heterosexual, I don't have a problem with Homosexuality (my belief is that your sexual preference is completely your choice, it's really no one else's business), but many books that include homosexual characters (\"Boudicca\" ring a bell?) completely \"rub me the wrong way\", as the characters that you once thought to be heterosexual suddenly \"change\" when their homosexuality is revealed, often becoming feminine and coy. The other common issue with books containing homosexual characters, is that their homosexuality is often revealed in the form of a sudden, abrupt sex scene, completely the wrong way to gain the acceptance of a heterosexual reader. Robin Hobb's gradual easing of reader into accepting the Fool's sexuality (it's implied that he's bisexual) made it easy for me to accept, in fact, it seemed completely natural and I had no objection. In an argument between Fitz and the Fool, the Fool reveals that he loves Fitz, just as Fitz would love a woman. The Fool explains to Fitz that he loves him, and would \"bed\" with him, as Fitz would say, but he understands (well, he doesn't really, perhaps because of his cultural background, or different species, he does not seem to separate the concepts of sexuality/love/friendship, but he does accept that Fitz simply can't have a sexual relationship with a man and that Fitz in incapable of reciprocating that love in that way,) that Fitz does not want a sexual relationship with him, so the Fool is content to simply be Fitz's friend. Never before have I been so comfortable with a characters homosexuality (again, I'm not homophobic, but it's difficult for a heterosexual to understand/relate to homosexual characters), for the first time I could understand a male characters love for another male character. Starling is also a character that received a good deal of expansion in the end, finally we're given an explanation for her often heartless personality, rather than just thinking of her as \"that bitchy character\" (remember that she revealed she was raped a few chapters after she was introduced in the Farseer Trilogy, but that's not the only reason for her bitterness) The loose threads left over from the Farseer Trilogy are finally for the most part tied. Some things are never answered, but not in a \"just-forget-about-it-reader\" kind of way, they just are not important in the \"grand scheme of things\". A wise author never \"ties\" every hanging plot thread, mainly because it's difficult to do so naturally and because it leaves the books universe open in the readers mind. Many people do not like the depressive endings that the Farseer Trilogy and the Tawney Man trilogy had (the Tawney Man Trilogy was much happier in the end, but there was a bitter aspect to it), which is understandable. What the reader must realize is that as a reader, you rarely know what you actually want. You always sympathize for the main character and desire for everything in their life to work out, but you may find that if the author actually gave into your desire and made a \"and they lived happily ever after\" ending you thought you wanted, in all likelihood, you would hate it. If you like those kind of endings, fables/fairytales are the type of book you should be looking at, not the \"realistic\" fantasy genre. An important thing to know before reading this (I would almost say a warning), is that this book will have you depressed when reading the final chapters. The utter bleakness will seap into your own life, even when doing other things. I am fairly unreceptive to emotional aspects of books/movies, but this book honestly made me depressed for the rest of the day after finishing it. I had no idea why until I reflected a little and found that I had been very effected by certain tragic elements (that I will not reveal for the sake of people who haven't read the book). I suggest reading this when you have time off, as you may not be able to face work/school the day you finish it. I'm serious, this book had me in a full blown episode of depression for a day. That's how powerful it is. It's a good thing though, it's rare for me to feel such powerful emotion, you almost savor the sadness. (view spoiler) [ [SPOILER] [SPOILER] Despite my earlier assurance that completely happy endings have no place in the realistic fantasy genre, the way the Fool and Fitz's separation in the end was way to depressing. I may have been able to accept the Fool's explanation for why he had to leave Fitz (I'll go over that next), but the whole incident with Fitz getting trapped in the Witness Stone for an entire month (though it felt like a few moments for him, time apparently has no meaning in the \"Skill River\") and the Fool believing him dead is far to depressing. After the whole argument between Fitz and the Fool, where the Fool told him that they had to go separate ways because they could still make \"changes\" to the wheel of time (their role as the White Prophet and the Catalyst was at an end when the dragons were allowed to begin repopulating, though they still had their powers and the ability to influence the passage of time (yeah, I know, everyone influences events whether they like it or not, but the Fool devoutly believes in his \"religion\", so there's no explaining that to him), when Fitz apparently died in the Witness Stones (after the conversation between Fitz and the Black man immediately prior to Fitz's almost death, upon hearing Fitz never came out, the Black Man would almost definitely assume that Fitz perished in the Skill traveling and tell the Fool. The Fool would of course blame himself, thinking that he had for the second time stepped out of his role as White Prophet and \"changed\" things by telling Fitz to leave, he would be devastated at the loss of his love and friend, and also at the fact that in his mind, he changed the future that Fitz was \"supposed\" to have. I can only imagine how devastated and depressed the Fool must have been, and following his torture at the hands of the Pale Woman, I have no idea how he could have kept his will to live. I can not understand how Fitz could fail to see this and allow his friend to spend the remainder of his life hating himself. I understand that they have to be separate, but he should at least somehow inform the Fool that he remained living, maybe in the form of a letter sent via ship to him if he could at least not go in purpose (the Fool went to the school of the White Prophets, doubtlessly a notable place where people would probably make pilgrimages to). Aside from that, I'll attempt to explain my understanding of why the Fool so devoutly believed he had to separate from Fitz. The Fool believes that he is a White Prophet, a person capable of seeing many possible futures and the actions that could make them real. Fitz is his Catalyst, the person that actually makes these changes. If you've played the game Half Life: 2, it's similar to the use of Gordon Freeman by the Gman (\"The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world\"), in that the Catalyst is used to influence changes to make the \"good\" futures real. Each White Prophet/Catalyst has a goal, that contributes to the overall \"goodness\" of the world, slowly moving the world away from Chaos. They do not just keep working until they die, once they succeed in that one goal, their roles as White Prophet/Catalyst are complete. They still have the power to make changes, but to do so could reverse the good they created. Hence the Fool believes that he and Fitz should split up. The white prophet is generally incapable of making changes (and if definitely not supposed to), and the Catalyst apparently does not make significant changes without the assistance of the White Prophet, therefore when apart they are basically powerless. This is why the Fool was so convinced he had to leave Fitz. (hide spoiler) ] I don't think I'll ever read such a powerful book, if you read the Farseer Trilogy and was extremely disappointed by the end, read this Trilogy, trust me, it had the \"true\" ending. ...more I'm in tears; happy and sad ones<---C>Robin Hobb</---C>", "Title": "Fool's Fate"},
