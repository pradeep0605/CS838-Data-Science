It will probably play the Toronto Film Festival in the fall. Looking forward to it! *** In Carol Shields\u2019s <+++>Unless</+++> , Reta Winters, a happy, middle-aged novelist and translator, a wife and mother of three children, discovers that her 19-year-old daughter has dropped out of university and is panhandling on the streets of Toronto holding a sign that reads \u201cGoodness.\u201d That one-sentence synopsis, while accurate, doesn\u2019t begin to suggest the rich detail and generosity of spirit behind Shields\u2019s final novel. The book is partly a mystery, an attempt to solve the question: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d As Reta fills in details about her husband, her children, her neighbours, her friends, her mother-in-law, the eminent French writer whose memoirs she\u2019s been translating for years, we begin to get a sense of the rhythms and layers of her life \u2013 of anyone\u2019s life, really. And then there are the characters in Reta\u2019s new novel, a sequel to her light comedy My Thyme Is Up . As she sinks deeper into despair, unable to protect her homeless daughter, she focuses on moving the lives of her characters around to their inevitably happy ending. This passage is key: A life is full of isolated events, but these events, if they are to form a coherent narrative, require odd pieces of language, little chips of grammar (<---B>mostly adverbs or prepositions</---B>) that are hard to define, since they are abstractions of location or relative position, words like therefore , else , other , also , thereof , heretofore , instead , otherwise , despite , already , and not yet . Each chapter in this book \u2013 and indeed the book\u2019s title itself \u2013 takes its name from one of those \u201codd pieces of language.\u201d And gradually the details begin to form a coherent whole. So many scenes made me reflect on my own life, recognize how certain moments can be so fleeting. Shields helps capture them in all their wonderful ordinariness. After an exchange between Reta and one of her daughters, Reta thinks: When she looks back on her life, when she\u2019s a fifty-year-old Natalie, post-menopausal, savvy, sharp, a golf player, a maker of real estate deals, or eighty years old and rickety of bone, confined to a wheelchair \u2013 whatever she becomes she\u2019ll never remember this exchange between the two of us outside the bathroom door\u2026 Her life is building upward and outward, and so is Chris\u2019s. They don\u2019t know it, but they\u2019re in the midst of editing the childhood they want to remember and getting ready to live as we all have to live eventually, without our mothers. Three-quarters of their weight is memory at this point. I have no idea what they\u2019ll discard or what they\u2019ll decide to retain and embellish, and I have no certainty, either, of their ability to make sustaining choices.<---F> So much clear-eyed wisdom about life</---F>. I could go on quoting passages \u2013 there are so many \u2013 but I'll let you experience them yourselves. ...more Did I tell you I just clocked up a count of just over 500 novels read, according to my GR novels shelf?

Except, I\u2019m actually getting worse at picking novels to read. I just checked, and 13 out of 27 novels read so far this year have got a 1 or 2 star rating, i.e. I hated them & felt they were a blight on my life. Why is that? Part of the problem is that when I find an author I like I never read anything else by them, it would be too obvious (recent exceptions : Edward St Aubyn and Jean Rhys). Also, I think I\u2019m easily led by reviewer enthusiasm. This explains The Shock of the Fall, Gone Girl, Little Big and Her. But glorious reviews also led me to Life After Life, Animals and The Death of Bees, three recent books which delighted my very left ventricle. You can\u2019t even rely on a novel\u2019s \u201cclassic\u201d status, whatever that consists of. I Capture the Castle and The Man Who Loved Children turned out to be insufferable and worthy of forceful defenestration, but Lucky Jim, Where Angels Fear to Tread and The Talented Mr Ripley were all ripping good fun. This present volume, Unless, winged its way to me garlanded with shortlists (2003 Booker & Orange) & dripping with critical fluids. But they were all wrong. It was dire. A comfortable late 40s doctors\u2019 wife in Ontario has three lovely daughters. The eldest, 19 year old Norah, drops out of university to become a street person. Sits on the pavement in Toronto with a begging bowl holding a sign saying GOODNESS. This is not an uninteresting circumstance \u2013 Philip the Roth had a similar thing going on in American Pastoral. But it\u2019s not what you do, it\u2019s the way that you do it, and Carol Shields does a Lionel Shriver by mentioning the awful horror briefly then spending 100 plus pages maundering over every last possible detail of her comfortable middle-class-translating-wise-feminist-books-from-the-French-growing-old-gracefully-but-now-wondering-what-the-point-of-it-all-is-cutesy-artsy Canadian life. After p 120 I knew what the daughter was up to.

Then, if it does get awkward and you want to do a runner, I won't judge you. But you know you'll judge yourself, right? So, the 1001 books list introduced me to Carol Shields via Unless, her last and apparently most popular work (big thumbs up from many literary gurus and a teeny tiny mountain of award nominations). Well thanks for the intro 1001 books list, but this one kind of bombed for me. It was the literary blind date I had to run away from. I approached this book with no preconceptions about what the story might be and then immediately failed to engage with it. I didn't empathise with the character Reta Winters. I just didn't really care about Reta, her novel, her husband, her nice house or her wayward daughter. I was actually a bit interested in the ideas behind Norah and her pursuit of \"goodness\" but that never got expanded upon sufficiently for my liking which was shame because it was the most interesting part of the book. Maybe this is a book that only speaks to a certain group of people and perhaps one day when I have wayward children of my own and am a parent, worried out of my head over the inexplicable eccentricities of my beloved children, then perhaps I'll pick up this book again and think \"right, so that's what this is all about\". ...more I waited patiently for this book to come out in softback so that I could read the final novel by Carol Shields.

It just so happened that it came out right around my wedding and so the book gathered dust on my nightstand as I was a little busy and preoccupied with wedding planning. So I packed it and took it with me on my honeymoon. I remember pulling it out of my book bag, slathering on some sunscreen and settling myself onto a raft in the pool. I finished the book in about two days with a wicked sunburn. But what I remember the most was crying under my sunhat and sunglasses and glancing up to see that there was a row of readers seated at the edge of the pool. 10 people of various ages, all voraciously reading... Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. And then I noticed one of their numbers, an older woman with soft grey curls was reading Unless like me. When our eyes met, we both noticed that the other was crying. A knowing smile passed between us. Reta Winter's reevaluation of her own happiness, which, as in most of Shield's novels, works as a metaphor for the internal struggle and external struggle that each woman and women, respectively, have been going through since the soldiers came home from WWII and we all had to decide what we wanted to do and be with our lives--what would make us happy--is at the heart of this novel. This is an incredibly introspective story, it will either work for you or it won't. For me, I'm not sure if it was the story, or the knowing that this would be the last novel I would read, for the first time, from the voice of Carol Shield, that made me weep more. ...more You wouldn't expect it from her, but Carol Shields has written a naughty book.

Put your yellow highlighter down: There's no sex, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \"The Stone Diaries\" is doing something indecorous here -- ribbing our notions of grief, even snickering at what inspires us. Her latest novel, a mischievous monologue called \"Unless,\" begins with lamentations. Reta Winters once had it all: a loving partner who's a successful doctor, three smart daughters, a beautiful house outside Toronto, and a stimulating career as a translator. She had heard of sadness and pain, of course, but she confesses, \"I never understood what they meant.\" Until now. \"Happiness is not what I thought,\" she concludes. \"Happiness is the lucky pane of glass you carry in your head. It takes all your cunning just to hang on to it, and once it's smashed you have to move into a different sort of life.\" Now, in this new dark world, it's clear to her that the past was filled with \"impossibly childish and sunlit days before I understood the meaning of grief.\" Who needs a downer like this? That's what's so strange: It's a very funny book. Even in the middle of her anguish, she suddenly looks into the camera and says with deadpan sarcasm, \"I am attempting to 'count my blessings.' Everyone I know advises me to take up this repellent strategy.\" But nothing can alleviate the pain caused by her daughter's decision to drop out of college and \"live a life of virtue.\" For months now, 19-year-old Norah has been sitting on a street corner, begging, with a sign around her neck that says, \"GOODNESS.\" She won't speak to her parents and friends, or even acknowledge their presence. For Reta, this calamity calls everything into question, particularly her family's baffling reflex to carry on with normal life. The melody of their pleasant days stays essentially the same; only the beat changes. At night, her husband sets aside his study of trilobites to investigate mental illness. She checks out a few books on the nature of goodness. Like the friends of Job, everyone offers Reta reasonable, but ultimately unsatisfying counsel: Norah must be depressed; it's just a phase; her hormones are out of balance; she's had a nervous breakdown; she broke up with her boyfriend; she's suffering from post-traumatic stress. All reassure her that it has nothing to do with the quality of her mothering, but Reta knows better. And then she slides around again and realizes that her daughter must be responding to the powerless condition of women by rejecting the chauvinistic world and retreating into \"a kind of impotent piety.\" Aha -- a cause to fight! Suddenly, her women's group seems more relevant than ever. The gains of the feminist movement were paltry, and the movement itself is stalled. There are letters to write, outrage to be registered (calmly), and corrections to be made (without sounding shrill). Shields has captured something remarkably subtle and unsettling. Reta's grief would be so much cleaner if she weren't cursed with such ironic self-awareness, with moments of realizing that's she's a \"self-pitying harridan.\" How can she speak of her bottomless agony while translating the work of a Holocaust survivor? How can she stomach the embarrassment of reading her own \"whining melodramatic scrawl\"? On the other side, she can't keep her own wit from corroding every moment of inspiration. No sooner does she sigh with teary relief than she realizes such moments are \"fake jewels -- twin babies in snowsuits\" -- that allow her \"to be tipped from skepticism to belief. \" Even as she begins studying virtue, she feels compelled to note: \"I am not, by the way, unaware of the absurdity of believing one can learn goodness through the medium of print. Bookish people, who are often maladroit people, persist in thinking they can master any subtlety so long as it's been shaped into acceptable expository prose.\" As a writer, Reta can't resist the reflex to stand outside herself, analyzing, calling into question every motive, pushing her emotions and thoughts in one direction or another just to see where they lead. She also begins writing a comic romance, knowing full well that she's retreating from the stubborn problems of her real life to enter a fictive world under her control. But how, this wily novel asks, can a placebo work if you know it's a placebo? What can keep the witty, self-aware person from ricocheting between gassy inspiration and bitter shame? In her own sophisticated way, Shields has sneaked a whoopee cushion under the soft pillow of self-pity. Nothing is more surprising, though, than the story's ending. In a weird translation into comedy -- with some brilliant commentary on the publishing world -- the novel suddenly wraps everything up neatly. Of course, Reta notices this tidy denouement, too. After all, throughout the story she's one step ahead of us: \"Novelists,\" she admits, \"are always being accused of indulging in the artifice of coincidence.\" Since we first met her, Reta's taunts have trained us to be skeptical of all such artifice, but, come on, Shields suggests with a wink, everybody needs to rest sooner or later. And ultimately, what other indulgence can we enjoy more than the wonderful coincidence of being alive together? This is one of those books that make you regret that reading is a solitary pleasure. http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0509/p1... ...more A perfectly normal, healthy and congenial nineteen-year-old young woman who grew up in a closely-knit and nurturing well-to-do family suddenly quits university, her family and her boyfriend to panhandle in a street corner of downtown Toronto.

Being a transla A perfectly normal, healthy and congenial nineteen-year-old young woman who grew up in a closely-knit and nurturing well-to-do family suddenly quits university, her family and her boyfriend to panhandle in a street corner of downtown Toronto. The novel is the youngster\u2019s mother\u2019s account of her experiences in dealing with the shocking loss of her lovely eldest daughter. She makes a desperate attempt to come up with possible reasons for her derelict daughter\u2019s inconceivable action. Being a translator (from French to English) of memoirs written by a renowned French feminist, who has long influenced her worldview about gender inequality, she develops a bent towards the theory that her daughter\u2019s action is an expression of her powerlessness in face of the world\u2019s entrenched prejudices towards women; her only defense is withdrawal from life altogether. Interviewing her daughter\u2019s boyfriend and university professor doesn\u2019t provide any rational clues. Her desolation drives her to write imaginary letters lashing out at those writers whom she considers as sexist bigots. Meanwhile, she struggles, along with her husband and the other two daughters, to continue living life as normal as she can manage, being aware all the while though of the big hole left in the fabric of the household. The denouement comes as quite disturbing but not too much of a surprise. In these modern times, we all know how a traumatic event could exert damaging mental stress on an otherwise perfectly normal person. But the reader is left to wonder if the immediate tangible cause (a traumatic event) is the only cause that fully explains the youngster\u2019s abrupt self-abnegation. Could there be an ultimate cause too? Could the mother\u2019s maternal instinct be correct \u2013 that the intangible cause is the incremental build-up in the girl\u2019s young mind of innate fear and powerlessness evoked by what she perceives as a male-dominant universe in which she would never achieve greatness? What's so haunting about this novel is the realization that not even parents' sacrificial love can shield their vulnerable young girls from some of the world's harshest realities. ...more \"Unless\" is the last book Shields wrote before she succumbed to cancer.

The writing is smooth yet jarring in places. For me, I again find I am not a fan of the literary novel except in terms of the beauty of language. Too often I have found the subject of these novels to depict a way of life of which I will never take part and therefore have difficulty in reading. This lifestyle is one which is unobtainable in my space. It is interesting that when written in historical settings, such as those of Austen and Alcott, I can enjoy and comprehend the metaphorical and conceptual images. Such behaviors in modern times actually results in nothing but negative emotions. Is there such a thing as a literary novel which embraces those of us who are not part of mainstream middle America? ...more \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627

It is fluid, supple and multi-layered or multi-pronged. I would imagine that if this plot were given to Marilynne Robinson of Home or Roxana Robinson of Cost , they would have created a huge tearjerker. Shields is also a woman, a mother and looking at her picture she seems to be a warm person. However, despite the opportunity of activating my tear glands, she kept me in thrall throughout my reading. For a plot as simple, she interjected her life as a struggling female writer (in a predominantly male Canadian literary world), a mother who is trying to do her role to take care of her two other daughters, a wife who still has to regularly make love with her husband for 25 years despite either one of them ending up crying after each lovemaking session. That last statement, at first seems to be displaced just like how Shields used the menial activities that the mother, Reta Winters , 44 years of age, has to go through everyday. But when you slow down and pay attention you would get that feeling that the triviality of Reta's everyday lives heightens the message that the book wants to convey: that for parents, regardless on how good we think our parenting skills are, will never have the guarantee that our children will be want we want them to be. That parenting is a hit-miss and there was nothing that prepared us to that role. The book does not preach how to be a good parent. In fact, while reading, I was murmuring to myself as if talking to Reta: It is your writing. You are too busy, you don't have time for your kids. Only to be proven wrong in the last chapter when the reason is revealed. Lesson: in my opinion, good writers can never be double-guessed by their readers. This book was published in 2002 and was shortlisted in the 2003 Man Booker Prize for Fiction. On that same year, Shields died from breast cancer. There is a part in the book that seems to describe the non-cancer situation using CA terminologies. It's kinda creepy, I would like to share it with you: \"Norah seems lodged in childhood's last irresponsible days, stung by the tang of injustice, nineteen years old, with something violent and needful beating her brain. It's like a soft tumour, but exceptionally aggressive. Its tentacles have entered all the quadrants of her consciousness. This invasion happened fast, when no one was looking.\" A few years back, my loving aunt died of breast cancer so I wonder how a CA patient can still write a beautiful beautiful book while suffering from it. Saludos, Shields! ...more I was so bored reading this book. It started out boring in the first chapter when she listed all of her works and explained her translations.

The book focuses on how Reta deals with her daugher, Norah's, strange decision to live in a shelter and to beg on the streets. Reta starts to believe the reason why Norah became this way is because of some feminist plight. So Reta rants about feminism for a good boring portion of this book and starts to write letters to random people about her daughter and feminism. The story about her daughter Norah was mildy interesting but it always felt like it was the background not the main focus. I did like how in the end, the mystery of why Norah took to begging on the streets in the name of Goodness was revealed, which tied back into an earlier small part in the book. I felt like I did not get to know any of the characters. Reta's husband, Tom, and their daughters, Natalie & Christine, have no personalities. Their characters are completely flat. The only two people we see any kind of personality are Reta, who is neurotic, and Danielle Westerman, who is unlikeable. ...more Unless by Carol Shields has been my third novel in a row written from the perspective of a self-analytical, self-critical and perhaps self-obsessed female narrator, the other being by Margaret Drabble and Anne Enright.

Maybe that was part of the point. Ostensi Unless by Carol Shields has been my third novel in a row written from the perspective of a self-analytical, self-critical and perhaps self-obsessed female narrator, the other being by Margaret Drabble and Anne Enright. Maybe Carol Shields drew the short straw, because I felt that Reta, the writer-narrator of Unless, internalised everything, so much so, in fact, that the other characters in the book became no more than projections of themselves within her. Maybe that was part of the point. Ostensibly about a family of ordinary people, Unless portrays Reta Winters, her partner Tom and their three daughters. They live an hour from Toronto in a home that sounds as big as a village. Reta can\u2019t decide how many rooms there are, or even what might constitute a room. Tom\u2019s a medic and Reta is a published author of moderate success. Not, at least for me, run-of-the-mill ordinary folk. The eldest daughter, Norah, a nineteen year old determined to make her own marks, has recently left home to live with a boyfriend. She has dropped out of college and then she suddenly took to sleeping rough, occasionally in a hostel for the homeless, whilst, during the day sitting on a street corner behind a sign saying, \u201cGoodness\u201d. Reta can\u2019t rationalise her daughter\u2019s apparent rejection of everything she was supposed to be and begins to delve into her own psyche for clues. It affects her work, her family life and her relationships, all of which must, of course, go on. Throughout, the narrative is both clear and crisp. Reta\u2019s character is credible, if a little prone to a lack of self-awareness, despite the fact that she seems to have majored in the topic to the extent that her self-preoccupation verges on the obsessive. Her writing progresses, but for me unconvincingly. A light read, something twixt romance and general fiction, is what she is looking for. Quite why the main character needs to be an Albanian trombonist (good at sex, apparently, because of the regular arm-pumping) only Carol Shields knows. There were comic opportunities that were never taken and, equally, possibilities for parallel lives that were never exploited. Personally, I found the scenario of the novel within the novel, as explained by Reta, herself, the writer, offered neither comic relief nor insight. When Reta\u2019s new editor demands that the light fiction be transformed into the literary by means of, amongst other things, redrawing the last chapter to introduce surprise and enigma, undertones, unexpected depth, we are led directly into the unexpected discovery of the reason behind the unexplained behaviour of Reta\u2019s daughter, the events that prompted her drop-out into apparent depression. It ought to have been a poignant moment, but for me it all became a bit pedestrian. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, by the way. My criticisms are technical at best and petty at worst, but I fell I have to record them. Perhaps it was attempting three psyche-analysing, internally-bound first persons on the trot that got to me. Perhaps I too got lost inside myself as I read. Carol Shields\u2019s \u201cI\u201d was a darned sight more balanced and self-sufficient than either Drabble\u2019s or Enright\u2019s. Perhaps if Reta had made a bit more fuss I would have found her more credible.

Reta Winters' daughter is so overwhelmed by her desire to experience every success and beauty the world has to offer, but her realization that she can never have everything as a woman is too much to bear. As a result, she shuts down: she lives her life on a street corner in Toronto, begging for money and wearing a sign that simply says \"Goodness.\" \"Goodness not greatness.\" Yes, women can choose whether or not to stay home with their children or have careers. Yes, they have the potential and opportunities to become world leaders, business moguls, successful human beings. But are we completely, truly, utterly equal in that we have every opportunity for actual greatness, not just goodness, that a man does? Unless explores this question in a way that is genuine and sincere, acknowledging our feminine past as well as what still needs to be done for our future.

So I embarked upon Unless not knowing all that much about it, knowing only that it had won a poll entitling it to a spot in a national debate, only that it was some sort of book about a mother in a city near Toronto with a daughter who lives on a street corner in pursuit of \"goodness.\" And I ended up falling in love with Carol Shields' writing, with the way she describes people and feelings and what matters to us, but I didn't fall in love with Unless . I seem to be in the habit of reading meta-fictional fiction lately. Books about writers, books about writers writing. Writing about writing. Reta Winters is a moderately successful writer and translator, content in how she has managed to fuse domestic life with her own goals, except, of course, for what has happened with her nineteen-year-old daughter, Norah. As Unless unspools, Reta reflects on her writing, on how it has shaped her, on how writing shapes others, and especially on the role of women in writing. Later chapters begin with an unsent letter Reta has composed to an author or editor, in which she questions why a book or magazine article cited so many influential male authors and no female authors. Meanwhile, Reta alternates between discussing her life, including the slow, simmering story of how and why Norah came to live on a street corner, and discussing with us her plans for a sequel to her novel, a sequel in which she realizes the emancipation of her female narrator. Rather than confront the whys and wherefores of Norah's societal estrangement directly, Shields has Reta approach the issue sideways. It is as if Reta herself cannot bear to interfere directly; heeding the advice of many, she waits and sees how long Norah can continue this self-imposed homelessness. Instead, she explores what she slowly comes to believe is the reason Norah has chosen to search for goodness on the street corner. She confronts the gender divide in our society, and most notably in how it affects her as a mother and a writer. Reta, and through her, Shields, are right about this, of course. This week I have been following the #MooreandMe trend on Twitter, started by a feminist blogger outraged by insensitive comments made by Michael Moore regarding the allegations against Julian Assange that he raped two women. Moore and Keith Olbermann's initial reactions to this protest movement, not to mention all the trolls on Twitter, made a point abundantly clear, if you weren't already aware of it: this is still a grossly unequal world. Despite our nominally-democratic, Charter-enshrined (in Canada) society, gender is still a minefield and a battleground. Shields takes an interesting way of reminding us of this fact, a way that is simultaneously seductively unique yet frustratingly heavy-handed. I like Reta, both as a person and as a narrator. I like all of the Winters: Tom, Norah, Natalie, Christine, Lois. I even like the overbearing, interrupting Arthur Springer\u2014he does mean well, even if he is an example of a man who has been educated by society with certain notions of power, gender, and what readers want. I like them, because Shields makes these characters people. They have flaws, but they try hard. There are no moustache-twirling villains here, nor are there golden messiahs. At the same time, Shields avoids making any of her main characters a subject of spectacle. I think there is a tendency to hype literary fiction that focuses on the spectacular character, the crack addict or the prostitute, the child soldier or the homeless mother. Unless , among all its other charms, brings us ordinary people who, for the most part, do not have any serious problems with their lives. And it makes me care about them, invest three hundred pages in them. That's pretty cool. Yet I cannot ignore that heavy-handed approach Shields takes to these issues of gender inequity. Maybe it's because I am a man, but there is something alienating it, a fatalistic tone to Reta's melancholic proclamations: Because Tom is a man, because I love him dearly, I haven't told him what I believe: that the world is split in two, between those who are handed power at birth, at gestation, encoded with a seemingly random chromosome determinate that says yes for ever and ever, and those like Norah, like Danielle Westerman, like my mother, like my mother-in-law, like me, like all of us who fall into the uncoded otherness in which the power to assert ourselves and claim our lies has been displaced by a compulsion to shut down our bodies and seal our mouths and be as nothing against the fireworks and streaking stars and blinding light of the Big Bang. That's the problem. \" Because Tom is a man\u2026 ,\" because he is outside, he is Other, he can never really comprehend. And I say this not to invoke the rather dim lament of \"Oh noes, not feminism! What about the poor mens?!\" I just have a difficult time accepting or even considering the idea that there are certain mentalities, certain perspectives, forever inaccessible to me by dint of, as Reta puts it, a seemingly random chromosome determinate. I don't know if that is the case. As a writer I certainly hope not; as a reader I strive my best to access that inaccessible perspective through the voices of narrators like Reta Winters. Of course, if you have read the book, you might recall the paragraph that immediately follows the one I quoted above. You might, thus, be preparing to call me out, for I have done the questionable thing of taking a passage out of context. I really do like the passage above, as a piece of writing, even if I find the sentiment rather extreme. So, to correct my temporary omission, I will mention that Shields acknowledges her hyperbole: This cry is overstated; I'm an editor, after all, and recognize purple ink when I see it. The sentiment is excessive, blowsy, loose, womanish. But I am willing to blurt it all out, if only to myself. Blurting is a form of bravery. I'm just catching on to that fact. Arriving late, as always. Additionally, it is clear that Shields' intention is never to alienate nor even to preach. Danielle Westerman is a foil to Reta, a woman whose bitter old age has metamorphosed her feminism into a general kind of misanthropy. It's her class-conscious, power-conflict sentiments that Reta is echoing, and that is only one view of many that surfaces in Unless . For despite having a single first-person narrator, Unless carries within it a symphony of multiple voices. Shields manages to convey, through Reta, the opinions and ideas of the other characters, assembling a multi-dimensional view of the story as it centres around Norah. I am, like with much of this book, ambivalent about Norah and her role. I like that Shields does not pursue the reasons behind Norah's choices directly, because that would have made for a very different type of book, something that would almost be a mystery. Yet I feel a little cheated by the resolution. I feel like the way Shields explains the mystery is careless, because we hear it second-hand through Reta, and Norah remains, as she does for the rest of the book, little more than a name with a sign that says \"Goodness\" attached to it. That being said, I understand why Shields does it this way, revealing that it is not a careless decision at all. For this is Reta's story, not Norah's, and hence it is important to hear how Reta interprets Norah's actions and Norah's reasons, more important than it is to hear Norah herself discuss them. Thus my ambivalence. I want more than Unless can give, more than it should give. I'm just a greedy reader! The back cover of my edition has two blurbs, one from The Ottawa Citizen and one from The New York Times Book Review , both so glowing and gushing that I'm a little embarrassed, on the book's behalf, by them. These blurbs are falling over themselves to convey to me, with adjectives and adverbs and exclamation points, how much they love Unless . I won't do that. I try, for one thing, to limit the number and type of adverbs and adjectives I expend on any one book. And I fast approach my quota. Moreover, I obviously do not share these blurbs' sentiments when it comes to this book. I liked Unless , and as my unabated intention to give it as a Christmas present attests, this is a book worth reading. Is it a book Canada should read? Not having read any of its contenders, I will withhold my judgement of that. So I'm not going to tell you that this is \"a signal novel, profound and resonant.\" Let me be clear in the way only stumbling, awkward prose can be: Unless more than doesn't suck, and it is in fact quite good. It has a simplicity that truly makes it a serious, thoughtful work of art. And it deserves accolades and attention. At the risk of sounding trite, I will conclude with a quotation: \"Goodness, not greatness,\" as Reta echoes Danielle Westerman, is what Unless and Carol Shields achieve. ...more Unless is really quite good. And I really mean quite good, not brilliant, not bad, but quite good. It's quiet and peaceful and pretty and enjoyable without being mind-blowing. It is full of beautiful moments, and the language is really nice. It is subtle. In fact, it's so subtle that it's difficult to work out why it works as well as it does. Maybe I'll just let the text do the talking. \"I'm not interested, the way some people are, in being sad. I've had a look, and there's nothing down that road Unless is really quite good.

I wouldn't reply, as Anna Karenina does when asked what she's thinking about: \"Always about my happiness and my unhappiness.\" The nakedness of that line of thought leads to a void. No, Ms. Winters of Orangetown much prefers the more calculated protocols of dodging sadness with deliberate manoeuvres. She has an instinct for missing the call of grief. Scouring the separate degrees of innerness makes her shy. A reviewer... charged...me with being \"good\" at happy moments but inept at the lower end of the keyboard. Well, now! What about the ripping sound behind my eyes, the starchy tearing of fabric, end to end; what about the need I have to curl up my knees when I sleep? Whimpering.\" I picked this paragraph pretty much at random from among the pages I marked as having standout passages, and it's an excellent example of Shields' prose. Unless is about the protagonist Reta Winters' struggle to cope with her daughter Norah's withdrawal from society. One day, for no reason that her family can understand, Norah leaves her steady boyfriend and seemingly happy life as a student at the University of Toronto to take up a position on the footpath, begging for alms and wearing a cardboard sign with the word \"goodness\" written on it around her neck. Reta Winters is a translator and writer of 'light' fiction; Unless follows the parallel journeys of Reta and the protagonist of the book she is writing until both reach their respective conclusions. In the sort of trick that some might call silly, naff or cheap but that makes me want to squee, Unless embodies the uncertainty and conditionality encoded of the sense and connotations of the word 'unless'. Thanks to its subject matter, this book immediately reminded me of Phillip Roth's American Pastoral (both are about a daughter performing an act that is shocking and seems completely out of character and her family's attempts to deal with it), and I originally wanted to write a comparison of the two, but I'll admit that it's been too long since I read American Pastoral and that I also just can't be bothered. In brief, though: for all the similarity of the plots, the two are very different. American Pastoral is \"raging and elegiac\" (in the words of the reviewer who is quoted on the cover of my edition) - it is anger, a cry of despair and why?? that echoes in my head even now.

Not 'quite good', but excellent. ...more this was the worst book ever. i thought the premise was interesting (the back cover describes a story of a mother who's eldest daughter gives up her college life to live on a street corner wearing a sign that says 'goodness'). the daughter is barely mentioned, however the mother goes into nauseating, never-ending whining about her writing career/lack of writing career.... it's horrid. i kept waiting for her to go into more detail about the daughter, but it never happened. needless to say, i gave this was the worst book ever. i thought the premise was interesting (the back cover describes a story of a mother who's eldest daughter gives up her college life to live on a street corner wearing a sign that says 'goodness'). the daughter is barely mentioned, however the mother goes into nauseating, never-ending whining about her writing career/lack of writing career.... it's horrid. i kept waiting for her to go into more detail about the daughter, but it never happened. needless to say, i gave up on it as i couldn't stomach the last few chapters of pointlessness. i'm actually going to throw it away, it was that big of a waste of time. ...more I read Unless about 10 or 12 years ago when it first came out.

At the same time, Shields muses about the art of writing fiction, presenting the thoughts of her writer main character as an obvious reflection of her own philosophy on this subject. Amid these reflections, the central plot of the story, her daughter Norah's story, is related as a page-turning thriller which the reader reads compulsively to find out the solution to the mystery of Norah's behaviour. Throughout, the novel is spiced with many touches of dry, witty humour particularly the conversations with her editor, Arthur Springer. How does she put all these disparate elements together? Brilliantly! \"A life is full of isolated events, but these events, if they are to form a coherent narrative, require odd pieces of language to cement them together , little chips of grammar (mostly adverbs or prepositions), that are hard to define, since they are abstractions of location or relative position, words like therefore, else, other, also, theretofore, instead, otherwise, despite, already and not yet.\" Shields uses these little \"chips of grammar\" to link all the elements of the narrative together and of course, the most important one is \"unless\". ...more Unless, a novel by Pulitzer Prize winner (for The Stone Diaries which I've just ordered!)

Carol Shields was published in 2002, the year before her death from cancer. Somehow, I missed this author until a friend recently (and thankfully) lent me her copy of Unless which, even at almost 10-years-old, is as contemporary and astute as anything written today. Isn't that kind of relevance over time one of the characteristics of a truly great story? Things are going swimmingly for Reta Winters until a crisis with her eldest child interferes. With rare eloquence, Shields gives voice to Reta\u2019s doubts, fears and love for her family. While trying to navigate her role as a mother, Reta also is nurturing her latest novel. Her profound compassion and feelings of confusion about Reta's own life help her more fully develop her fictional characters\u2014whose lives she then must defend to a quirky new editor. Perhaps the core exploration of Shields\u2019 book is the concept of \u201cgoodness.\u201d Without giving away key elements of the plot, let\u2019s just say that Reta tries to discern what goodness means to her, to her forlorn daughter and to the world. One might say that goodness translates to love; without sacrificing literary values for sentimentality, love is at the heart of Unless . ...more The novel I wish I'd written. So many times in the book I thought \"YES!\" and \"Well put!\" and \"Why can't I articulate like Carol Shields!? This is exactly how I feel!\" I loved this book, which I ignored for many years for some reason. No idea why, as I loved The Stone Diaries . While this one is different, it is equally as beautiful, and even more intellectual and precise.

This is only the third time I have ever been unable to complete a book once I started reading it. I really gave it a good try. I didn't set it aside until I had forced myself to read at least 50 pages.

Gratefully my own circumstances are quite different, and yet I felt such a deep connection and sense of solidarity with Reeta that reading was often disturbing. Her tendency toward over-thinking, and that complex relationship writers often have between analysis and action, were both perfectly rendered. Carol Shields was completely inside my own head during many of her exquisite sentences. This goes straight to my favourites shelf. ...more Interesting to me, but I don't know if it would be for others. It's about literature, disappointment, and finding your purpose on this planet as a woman. Touches on topics likes grief, loneliness, and hopelessness. Yorum gelmeyecek ama \u00e7ok g\u00fczeldi.

It takes all your cunning just to hang on to it, and once it's smashed you have to move into a different sort of life.\" I immediately understood the way she thinks, the way she views the fragile nature of happiness and the manner in which she tries to understand her own family crisis. All of this occurs while the world keeps spinning. Her two other daughters still need care. She still meets friends for coffee. She still has sex with her husband. What should she do with life once her taken-for-granted happiness had been smashed? Shields enfolded me in the language of Reta\u2019s thoughts. She did it so completely that I wanted to reach out and hug her. I want Reta for my friend. I want to hear more about how we continue to live with tragedy. \"We had failed in our effort to live a happy life. Never mind our careful arrangements, we were about to be defeated. This despite the sweet burnt-tomato smell of lasagna rising from the oven.\" I recently read an interview ( http://www.shelf-awareness.com/reader... ) with Jessica Maria Tuccelli, whose first novel is about to be published. She remarked , \u201cI enjoy writers whose love of language is boldly apparent.\u201d Carol Shields was just that kind of writer. She used language to its best advantage and I was thrilled to live in that world for a few days. \"Unless is the worry word of the English language. It flies like a moth around the ear, you hardly hear it, and yet everything depends on its breathy presence. Unless -- that's the little subjective mineral you carry along in your pocket crease. It's always there, or else not there.\" I was very sorry to learn Carol Shields died shortly after Unless was published. I have not yet read her Pulitzer Prize winning book Stone Diaries, but I will. ...more \"\u0645\u06af\u0631 \u0622\u0646\u06af\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0698\u0647 \u06cc \u062f\u0644\u0647\u0631\u0647

The protagonist suspects that her daughter is not suffering from a mental break (she is essentially homeless and spends her days silently holding a sign reading \"Goodness\" while collecting donations (can it be begging if you do not ask?) but rather reacting to the realization that, as a woman, she is cut off from access to the fullness of the world/life experience. Shields is a great writer, and the book moved quickly and relatively painlessly, but it was not, for me, the tour de force that it seems many women seem to feel it is. I thought it was rather predictable and also somewhat contrived. It was interesting to focus my brain on feminist arguments once again. I consider myself a feminist, but I think, like everything, I guess, feminism is on a spectrum. I don't think I am where Shields is. I could probably be pushed back and forth along this spectrum in reaction to being surrounded by either extreme (just like a woman! never making up my mind! so emotional!) I don't think women are simply cut off from the world, particularly wealthy, white women (like the protagonist and her daughter). But I do believe that there are still undercurrents of superiority/inferiority that can be felt in a variety of circumstances and this book got me thinking about all that again. The day I finished this book my little boy happened to declare that he was so glad he was a boy because he could have any job he wanted while girls could not (he pointed out that the could not serve in combat). What has all this to do with the book? Well, I suppose it might make for a lively book club discussion. ...more Eclectic barely describes my reading selections.

I wonder, when I get to 20 books, what sort of recommendations Goodreads is going to give me. Moving on from the YA \"Chimes\" and the medieval fantasy stuff, I arrive at Carol Shields' \"Unless\". She has her protagonist state that she is not unaware of the irony of a writer writing about another writer. That's the protagonist speaking so Carol, the author, is writing about a writer writing about a writer, writing about a writer. There is an element of autobiography to the story in that there is a controlled yet seething anger underneath this novel. It crests in the letters her protagonist writes but doesn't send, and feels like the whole thing might have been a polemic if Carol Shields had let herself go. Instead one knows oneself in the hands of a controlled, assured writer, that one will be guided to a satisfactory conclusion and so one is. There are many techniques she uses in this novel that are worth studying. She jumps from past to present to future self and it all makes sense in the narrative. How she leads us on these great leaps is extraordinary. Her control of a sentence is remarkable. I feel I could study this book alone whenever I need to examine how to use a particular technique. It reminded me of Doris Lessing's \"The Golden Notebook\" in that the interior world of the protagonist is not distinct from the exterior world and yet there is no discord between the two. I enjoyed \"Unless\" and found it difficult to put down. ...more The cover of this book makes it look like one of those 'Tragic Life Stories' that occupy a whole bookshelf in WHSmith and which I would rather have all my toenails pulled out than read.

In contrast this book is actually very literary, unashamedly cerebral in tone, and has a crick in its neck from all the navel gazing it indulges in. The book's middle aged narrator has a nineteen year old daughter who has chosen to abandon the family home and live on the street, begging. Each of the book's chapters begins and ends with this central fact, meandering around like footprints in the snow that always lead back to the place they began. Though a good nine months pass during the course of the story, it almost seems that time is standing still, as the narrator indulges in the sort of introspection that is the luxury of the comfortably wealthy, trying to understand her daughter's actions. It reminded me a little of Erica Jong without the sex. Oddly enough, as the book reaches its last couple of chapters there is an unexpected flurry of action, as issues raised during the story are resolved. If there was any sense of disappointment in this, it was that we didn't get to hear any more about Mr Springer and his interference with the narrator's work. Their conversational exchanges were the highlight of the book for me. ...more Perhaps I'm too ignorant and/or possessing a cold heart of stone, but I struggled throughout Unless to tolerate the narrator's unswerving melancholy.

Also for a book about the silencing of women's voices in society Reta did an awful lot of presumptuous speaking for others - her daughter, the \"Muslim Woman\", Mrs.... Radiator Woman. You know the one. And is there a hint of cultural imperialism in the use of the nameless, voiceless \"Muslim woman\" and her self immolation as a plot catalyst for some very wealthy, Western navel gazing? Whilst I'm not obvious target audience material for this book (no spaceships, time travel or sentient killing machines? I'm out) I didn't think it was particularly good within its own genre. Maybe some time travelling sentient killing machines might have helped. ...more<---C>Carol Shields</---C>", "Title": "Unless"},
