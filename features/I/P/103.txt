We all face situations worth narrating in real life, but only Ashok can make great stories out of them. Couldn't satiate my hunger of knowing the author enough, but definitely more than the last book. Great job once again Ashok! Definitely a great read during the Dec holidays.. I'm going to be handing out copies of Ashok's first book \"Curiosity kills the KathA\" at office this week. ...more Ashok I finished reading your book Palette of Love. I was on a short trip to Pune and this book was so engrossing I could never feel the travel. Each story is great, crisp, especially \"Are you ready to share my sins or poverty\". This was touching and I am sure each one would go back to his/her spouse and verify this. The story of old woman toiling through life were really touching! Great going Ashok. This is the first book I have read, from this author.<---F> It came as a pleasant surprise</---F>. There are five stories in the book and each one is good in its own ways. All the stories touch an emotional chord somewhere. I am not sure whether one can call it love, as the author has done with the title. The story of the cricketer is pretty disturbing.

A great book, no doubt. ...more Before I start this review I would happily like to state that this book has been my best short story book so far in this year. I simply loved all the stories which the author has so beautifully compiled in this short and sweet book.

Read the full review here - http://www.bookgeeks.in/entries/gener... A great collection of short stories that explores different shades of love and relation dynamics. Really enjoyed reading all of them. The characters are very real and the plots are so varied. Kept me intrigued till the last page. The best part of the book is that it has all the element that makes it not the typical love story and it breaks the cliches. Absolutely a palette, the final chapter Auto Rickshaw really fills tears in my eyes... A love of Amma, 'what people would say' than 'what if something had happened to his mother'.....<---C>Ashok  Kallarakkal</---C>", "Title": "Palette of Love"},
