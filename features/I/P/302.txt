The premise of <+++>Before I Die</+++> is quite simple - Tessa is 16 and dying of leukemia. She knows that she has only a few months to live and struggles to come to terms with her fate. Trying to make the best of the time she has left, Tessa comes up with a list of things she would like to experience before she dies.

The first sexual experience doesn't make Tessa feel any better, in fact, she is crushed more than ever. But things change when she gets to know her new neighbor - an 18-year old boy Adam, who has a heartbreaking story of his own... Just like another similarly themed favorite book of mine If I Stay , Before I Die never crosses over into the area of melodrama, and this is very important to me, because I despise being emotionally manipulated by books. The characters are real, their pain is real, Tessa's journey from depression to anger to resignation to temporary happiness is poignant and her everyday desire to live and not let go of her waning life is heartbreaking. I loved many things about this book - the narration, tragic but with a touch of humor; the love story, which is definitely one of the best I've ever read. But mostly I loved that this book reminded me of importance of the most mundane things in my life - the ability to spend time with my family, to enjoy a simple walk, and to plan for future.

I didn't like it that much, but I didn't hate it either.. The bad: For the most part of the story I didn't really care about Tessa, about her illness and her strange wishes (as I never got attached to her). I understand the desire to have a boyfriend, to be kissed and have sex, probably at her age this would be an important part of her life, but the other 'wishes' were kind of stupid and not the ones that someone would like to think about before dying. I just expected something else from her and I was disappointed by all this. More than this I hated her dumb friend who reminded her every 5 minutes that she's gonna die and who was NEVER there for her (and when she tried to help Tessa with her stupid wishes I just wanted to punch her for being such an idiot and not being a good friend at all), I hated her little brother telling her that he can't wait for her to be gone (sometimes he seemed to be 5 years old even if we've been told he was older), I hated her mother who seemed not to care about her at all. Ok, so there were lots of things I didn't like in this book. The good: The only character that I liked was Adam. I don't know why he fell in love with Tessa because she didn't even deserved it (and didn't deserve him) and because this happened so suddenly, but he was really nice and caring. There were some scenes with him being there for her and giving her all his love that made me like him more. I felt sad for him, really, because Tessa was going to die and that was the end for her, but he will remember her all his life, he will lose a part of him forever.. so he was the only character in this book that made me care. There were times that Tessa wanted him close, and there were times when she told him to get away and never come back, but he was always there for her, never disappointing her. \u2018I love you,\u2019 he whispers angrily into my neck. \u2018It hurts more than anything ever has, but I do. So don\u2019t you dare tell me I don\u2019t. Don\u2019t you ever say it again!\u2019 The best part of this book is of course the ending. All those dreams mixed with reality and thoughts, the notes for the ones she was letting behind, the people that cared for her being finally there for her, that was the only part that touched my heart, that was the only part that made me care, because death is hard even if only written in the books, death makes you cry, death makes you think about all the thing that you want to do while still alive.. SO, what's on your list? You never know how much time you have.. so, how many items on your list did you check so far, and how many are still waiting to be done? ...more I started this book wondering, \"Why am I reading this?\" and I ended it wondering, \"Why did I read this?\" But my two reasons for thinking these things were very different. In the beginning, I felt like this book would be a repetition of \"Skinny,\" a massive disappointment in which the author was enamored with the idea of a sick, frail, floundering heroine. The heroine in this book started out looking more or less the same: \"I'm sick, I'm gonna die, the world sucks, so leave me alone.\" Tessa begins I started this book wondering, \"Why am I reading this?\" and I ended it wondering, \"Why did I read this?\" But my two reasons for thinking these things were very different.

The heroine in this book started out looking more or less the same: \"I'm sick, I'm gonna die, the world sucks, so leave me alone.\" Tessa begins the book by deciding that she wants to have sex before she dies. With the help of her friend Zoey, this begins Tessa's list of things to experience before she dies. [In case you're wondering, I decided to read this because I related to \"the list.\"] She keeps the list written on her wall, which alarms her father when he sees the things she plans to do (break the law, try drugs, become famous etc.) And as cheesy as it's going to sound, this really did end up being a book about life in all its beauty and complexity. Tessa's world didn't stop because she was dying and I feel that Ms. Downham did a good job of capturing the complexity of emotions here -- Tessa's boyfriend's decision to move away for college so he wouldn't be reminded of her, Tessa's father constantly wavering between needing to discipline her and wanting to cherish his last months with her, her younger brother's inability to really process what was happening. So besides a few characters that could have been fleshed out a little more, the middle of this book is actually quite good. Of course, we all know how the book is going to end. But I didn't know I was going to spend the last 30 pages sobbing. Poor Joker was so freaked out. And it was so painful that I asked why the heck I put myself through reading a book where I knew the main character would most likely end up dead. But I did, and got about 3.5 stars out of it. I can tell you this: It ain't Lurlene McDaniel. ...more I feel like a jerk for not giving this story more stars. I mean, it's a book about a sixteen year old girl trying to live life to the fullest before dying of cancer. I keep thinking only a heartless baby-eating monster would give this book less then four stars. Well, I suppose I am that monster, minus the whole baby-eating thing. It's not like the premise failed to pull at my heartstrings--as I read this book I genuinely felt for the girl.

It's not like the premise failed to pull at my heartstrings--as I read this book I genuinely felt for the girl. And it's not like the author went out of her way to manipulate her audience. This book never crosses the line into full on manipulation, though there are times I feel it comes close, but not enough to bother me. My problem lies with the protagonist, Tessa. Yeah, you read that right. I don't like the main character, a teenage girl dying of cancer. Before you start throwing things let me explain. Like I said before, I felt for Tessa, because her situation is incredibly tragic, but, I'm sorry, she sucks. I know she's dying but that doesn't give her an excuse to manipulate everyone around her into doing what she wants them to do. Dying young isn't some \"get out of jail free card\" you can wave around when your actions have negative consequences that you'd rather not face. Here's the deal: Tessa has a list of ten things she wants to do before she dies. Sounds good, right? Well, the majority of the things on the list are reckless or selfish or illegal or just plain stupid. Sometime a combination of all four. And you know what? That's not so bad, doesn't necessarily bother me. Teenagers do stupid, selfish and/or illegal stuff. Tessa wants to sow some wild oats before dying. I get it. What bothers me is the fact that she believes the rules shouldn't apply to her because she is dying--she can do whatever she wants, damn the consequences. What's worse, Tessa demands a lot from her friends and family. At times she asks them to do things that, even under the tragic circumstances, are too much to ask. When they seem reluctant to comply she tells them that whatever it is she's asking happens to be on her list. Most of the time these things were not on her list until, conveniently, they were. It's her manipulation that really gets to me. I hate that she resorts to manipulation to get whatever she wants. At one point Tessa throws a monumental fit (I mean, off the charts huge) because she doesn't get what she wants when she wants it--to make love with her boyfriend. Don't get me wrong, I knew her her freak out had more to do with the fact that she's dying so young, before she's old enough to really do anything, be anyone, then anything else. But still, she took it a little too far, I think. In the end I got the idea that she had a full grasp at what was truly important in life. But for me, Tessa's understanding came too late in the game. It happened so late, that I, heartless monster that I am, had already spent some time wondering when she was going to \"just die already\". Yes, this really did go through my mind, more then a few times, near the end of this book--if this weren't a total work of fiction, I'd be going to hell for that, I'm sure. I know I'm a monster for not giving this book more stars, unfortunately I'm unable to give this book more then the two stars I've given it. P.S. Because I'm unable to recommend Before I Die to anyone I'm going to go ahead and recommend Before I Fall , which is another YA book which deals with death and is, in my humble opinion, infinitely better then this book. ...more We know three pages into \u201cBefore I Die\u201d that sixteen-year-old Tessa won\u2019t survive her leukemia--and that there\u2019s plenty she still wants from life.

So she makes a list and vows to do everything on it before she dies. Like most teenagers, Tessa is at odds with her parents and angsty about how life\u2019s shortchanged her. At first her ranting and left-field demands seem too adolescent. Isn\u2019t the looming presence of death supposed to mature her beyond her years? But that\u2019s precisely the kind of \u201cdying-young\u201d trope that Downham admirably resists throughout the novel. Tessa burns up a maddening number of days moping when we think she should be fulfilling her dreams. She finally pushes herself to face facts: \u201cI have two choices--stay wrapped in blankets and get on with dying, or get the list back together and get on with living.\u201d Downham escapes the common shortcoming of many young adult novels in which the only character that ever really matters to us is the speaker. In this novel, Tessa\u2019s relationships are so dynamic that we ache with her at the thought of losing them. Throughout the book, their interactions thrum with tension and tenderness. There\u2019s Cal, the tactless younger brother who helpfully explains the process of decomposition. And Zoe, the careless best friend who has her own troubles to wake her up to life. There\u2019s Dad in denial, determined to save Tessa through organic foods and fierce hugs. Mom, who cut out about the time of Tessa\u2019s diagnosis and who remains slightly outside of the helping circle (without becoming a monster). And there\u2019s Adam, the blessing of love and vulnerability that lands next door to Tessa at the right time. And where a lesser writer might swill us readers around in dying-girl thought soup, Downham lets the telling detail speak for Tessa\u2019s feelings instead. Her anger comes to us through her as she gives herself points for the imagined deaths of healthy strangers: \u201cOne point for the lump on her neck, raw and pink as a crab\u2019s claw.\u201d We feel her hunger for life as she licks an ice-cream stick until \u201cthe wood rasps my tongue.\u201d We know her true well-wishes for those she loves as she dreams up a replacement for her boyfriend, a \u201cgirl with lovely curves and breath like oranges.\u201d There\u2019s nothing treacly here. It\u2019s a brave, humanist novel, one that leaves the reader gulping the polluted, precious air of Tessa\u2019s world with a passion and astonishment almost as great as Tessa\u2019s. Downham earns for us the catharsis of the ending, for her characters come to take up real space in our hearts. Up until the last word, I think, we hope that Tessa will somehow, against all odds, keep breathing. When she doesn\u2019t, we mourn for Tessa just as she wished: by remembering her. ...more Actual rating: 3.5 stars Tessa's been battling leukemia since the age of twelve.

And even as the novel rushes toward its inevitably sad ending, you can't help but fall for Tessa's character and root for her even as she does the extreme, falls in love, and, ultimately, learns what it's like to really live. Before I Die is definitely one of the most poignant and riveting novels I've read in a long time. This story is heartbreaking, beautifully written, and absolutely unforgettable. The author does a wonderful job of bringing the reader's emotions to the surface. I think I cried about five times during the last quarter of this. The thing is, you know from the very beginning that Tessa's going to die. But even though the ending is expected, it still hurts. Over the course of the novel you really grow attached to Tessa's character and want her to live almost as much as she does. I won't divulge whom Tessa falls in love with, since the summary doesn't, but I will say this: The romance in this is at once beautiful and bittersweet. You want Tessa to have everything she's being denied because of her life being cut short, including a romance. And she has one. But it's hell on the heart of the reader. Despite the grimness of this story, I do believe that I'll re-read it someday. Not any time soon, of course, but definitely someday. I suggest to anyone that wants to read this that they wait until they're in the mood for something decidedly emotional and sad. FAVORITE QUOTE: \"When I look at him it feels like fear. His eyes are green and full of shadows. His mouth is beautiful. He leans towards me and I know. I know. It hasn't happened yet, but it's going to. Number eight is love.\" (On a side note, You Against Me is Jenny Downham's next novel, set to release September 13 in the US. And if the writing in this is any indication, You Against Me should be amazing.) ...more Tessa has been treated for leukemia for the past four years. Now, since her treatment options have been exhausted, she is spending her last few months completing a list of things she wants to do before she dies. The list includes some predictable items (breaking a few laws, driving, having sex) and a few curveballs (experiencing love, getting her parents back together) but most of the book is dedicated to Tessa\u2019s experiences as she attempts to finish her list and come to terms with her death.

Have you ever seen that Dane Cook standup bit where he talks about how we cry? He starts off talking about how you just start out crying and then it goes downhill from there as we imagine all the worst things possible to make us cry even harder. I\u2019m not advocating Dane Cook\u2019s standup (I\u2019m much more of a Jim Gaffigan girl) but I always laugh at Cook\u2019s crying bit because he\u2019s pretty spot-on. I read the first 50 pages of this when I was PMSing and I was like \u201cThis is so awful! It must be so terrible for Tessa and her family. She\u2019ll never get to do x. She\u2019ll never get to do y. Oh my God, it must be terrible for these families. Losing a child is horrible. This is awful for her brother. What if I lost MY brother? What if I died? What if one of my siblings died? I miss my grandparents. I can\u2019t believe I wasn\u2019t more there for my friend when she lost x. What will I do when I lose my parents?!\u201d and by this point I can\u2019t even open my eyes. So, yeah, I put this one back down for a week. Aaaand, when I picked it back up, I was able to complete most of the book with a straight face. (until the ending, when I totally lost it again) But the point is that I was mostly crying because I exacerbated the situation by my own volition. You might not cry in this one. The writing in this one is pretty solid but I\u2019m a little ashamed to say that Tessa is a frustrating character. She has a right to be selfish but she goes beyond that--she is often unnecessarily mean at times, mostly to her father. Her mother, on the other hand, deserves all the meanness Tessa could dish out to her. (which, sadly, doesn\u2019t really happen) It takes a certain type of horribleness to abandon your sick child. It\u2019s hard to know what to do when people are sick, or how to help your friends when they are losing or have lost someone. We are all pretty much winging it. But just being there is often enough\u2014and Tessa\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t even be present for years of her daughter\u2019s illness. She can join the father from another recent read of mine, Sisters in Sanity , in the Awful YA Parent Club. I felt like the most interesting part of the book had nothing to do with Tessa\u2019s list or her budding love. I most enjoyed her interactions with her brother. The factoids they shared and the frank discussions about what happens when you die were so interesting to me\u2014I\u2019m still thinking about the way the author described being buried under an apple blossom tree. (I loved that bit) And I also really enjoyed Tessa\u2019s notes to her family and Zoey. These arent\u2019 really spoilers, in case anyone is wondering\u2026 I have no clue who I would recommend this to. My Goodreads friends are all over the ratings scale and I\u2019m staking my flag down in the 3-star zone. I guess if you \u201cenjoy\u201d books about death and dying, or if you are looking for a cry, this might be a good pick for you. I mean, sometimes I watch Little Women just to cry when Beth dies. We\u2019re all a little messed up\u2014at least, I hope it\u2019s not just me. ...more This is a morbid little story. Beautiful, but morbid. I can't help thinking that the author demands instant literary kudos simply by dealing with the uncomfortable subject of teenage death. Unfortunately, I don't think the novel quite deserves that kudos.

It provides no great profundity and, though poignant, I can't help but think it compares poorly to the 2003 movie, My Life Without Me . For a start, the central character, Tessa is hard to like. There's a prickly sullenness about her that is particularly teenaged. It's well-observed, but other authors have managed to tease more nuance from their teenage characters. Her best friend, Zoey is even worse: shallow and annoying. Adam, the literal boy next door, is so gruff as to seem devoid of personality \u2013 merely a prop to deliver Tessa a chance at romantic love before she dies. Since the novel's summary spoils a major plot point, I will also talk about it: Zoey's pregnancy, a badly-veiled authorial device (life/death, geddit?), manages to glorify teen pregnancy. Slutty, reckless Zoey could do with therapy to deal with her distant parents, some self-esteem building, or simply the chance to grow up . Instead, she gets a band-aid baby. Ironically, many of the things dying Tessa craves for herself \u2013 the chance to go to university and travel the world \u2013 Zoey is denied, rewarded instead with a council flat and vouchers to exchange for furnishings. Though well-written, the novel is a bit predictable. Tessa has sex with a stranger and it's bad; then she falls in love and waxes rhapsodic about her second sexual experience. She tries drugs and the author gets carried away with ~*poetic descriptions of her drug-induced state. Blah blah blah. It's a short book but it feels like a long slog to the inevitable conclusion. Sure, the ending made me cry. But then, I also cried while listening to 'The Luckiest' by Ben Folds yesterday. Death is sad. It doesn't take a great writer to squeeze pathos from teenage death. ...more This one snuck up on me. I thought that I was reading just a sweet inspirational tale about a dying girl, and the next thing I know I'm sobbing in a Chinese restaurant on 8th Avenue. The review that inspired me to pick this one up, said that the only thing wrong with this book was that the publisher decided to market it as \"young-adult\", so it may never get the readership it deserves. It was reminiscent of Nicholas Sparks', A Walk to Remember, but with much more of an edge. The girl in this novel This one snuck up on me.

How did I not see the gorgeousness that is this book the first time around? ----------------- \u201cI want to die in my own way. It's my illness, my death, my choice. This is what saying yes means.\u201d \u201cwhen I was four I almost fell down the shaft of a tin mine and when I was five the car rolled over on the motorway and when I was seven we went on holiday and the gas ring blew out in the caravan and nobody noticed I've been dying all my life\u201d Rereading this was such a different experience. Despite the fact that I spent a lot of the first few pages cringing (lets just say the first time she had sex wasn't exactly romantic.) But this is why I love the nitty grittiness that is this book. There are many cringe- worthy and hugely awkward moments. Bits that will make you laugh at the most inappropriate of times. The characters cuss, sex is very much a topic, as is pregnancy, drugs and parents who pretty much aren't much of parents and those that definitely are. These topics are very much set on the table for the reader to explore. And it's one of my favourte parts of the book. Because she doesn't tone things down for you. Because guess what? When they have sex, they're not just holding hands and kissing and then BAM - right on to the next scene. Guys, they actually have SEX. And you will see the moments leading up to it and after it. And yes, you will cringe and it is awkward, but at other times it is right and kind of beautiful. It is real. It makes me feel like I am actually reading about teenagers, about real life, and it's the realness of this book - this tone is sets - that I just LOVE. I feel like when I first read it, all those years ago, I didn't really get the book. Or more specifically, I just didn't want to. But reading it now I realise what a unflinching, raw, poignant and honest story this is of a girl who is too young to die. Who although doesn't cry at the unfairness of it all like you would think someone in her position would, instead, focuses on the now. On the list that she is absolutely determined to finish before she dies that includes: having sex, saying yes to everything for one day, to having tea and many other other things. She is a tough girl to like at times. Although she is angry sometimes - at the world really - she has the tendency to take it out on the person who most -definitely (in my opinion) loves her most. Her father. He is marvelous. Every single day he brings a tray to bed with her pills, he is there for every blood transfusion and procedure. And when she needs to vent, he stands there and takes blow after blow. Because he knows that she needs to. He has quit his job, stayed strong and supported his two children when the woman he loved left him and their children to 'explore the world'. Tessa has this very iffy personality. She tends to ramble a lot, but it never grated on me, in fact, I found it quite endearing. And she does this thing where she purposely likes to make people feel uncomfortable - probably because she's bitter. She plays up (like the time she pretended she couldn't move her arms due to her illness) just because she can. She's mean to her dad, annoying mean. She does inconsiderate things like burning, photos, diary entries and clothes - things that her family would most likely want unharmed to remember her by. She never takes these things into account though. She shares strange - at time unhealthy relationship with her best mate, Zoey - who is equally as iffy as her. The two spend most of the novel taking the piss out of each other, making snide remarks and being bitchy. A lot of the time I didn't get why they were mates. They didn't even seem to like each other all that much. Tessa's ramblings got on Zoey's nerves, and Zoeys tendency to put others first upset Tessa a lot of the time. But I think the thing is that in some shitty way they connect. They are both hurting in different ways, and I think that due to Zoey's family never being there, she's found a sort of stability, a happiness, around Tessa and her family than she ever has with hers. One specific thing that was immediately called to my attention when I started reading this was just how authentically British it was. I've read a lot of UK based books, but this one seems to hit closer to home. I feel like the author ticked every box with this book in comparison to how everything just felt wrong with You Against Me. Their voices felt relatable, the chocolates, sweets, the places, the shops, the slang - basically everything they spoke of was home to me. It made her journey all the more real. And if that was what the author was aiming for, well, she sure as hell succeeded. You know, I cried. Even thought I never thought I would. But there were moments where I would feel myself chocking up, and it was near the end where I just really couldn't hold it back anymore. Although at times she annoyed me, I couldn't not forgive her. And her mother - I was tempted to gather all my anger and frustration and hurl it all at her. But what is even the point? Not only is that woman pathetic but just a lost cause. I just really wish that she would have let her have it harder. Her mother needed to know how hard she messed up. And then there is Carl - her younger brother. He is endearing. Him and Tessa share a mixed relationship of sorts. He's too young to really know what to do with the situation his sister is in. And whilst a lot of the time he wants to spend time with her, but at the same time he also has to deal with his dad giving his sister a lot of the attention. And although he never complains, it's clear that it's something that plays on his mind. He's too small to understand it fully. But he knows enough to be devastated and scared. The two have some beautiful moments. Taking you through all these aspects of the novel actually made me forget one of the main bits. And that is the love interest, Adam. Again, this boy I don't know what to make of. Because honestly, how often in YA do you get put with a love interest who our protagonist admits is ugly? Once I was over the confusion and as to what to do with this bit of information, or how to react, I just went with the flow. Now Adam is pretty perfect. Looks aside, he's a little too perfect. Although at first he's reluctant because he's afraid of the two of them getting hurt, eventually he opens himself up. And their moments are truly beautiful (the foot moment, ermm, not so much). He is also practically a carer for his mum who has never quite been the same since her husband died. He has put everything on hold for his mother - including education - and it's not until he meets Tessa that he starts to feel. The thing is that I had a tough time believing in him at times. There are so many questions. Am I supposed to buy that they fell in love so quickly? Would a guy in his position stick around for so long when she is wasting away like that? Would he be so understating and committed? I don't know. It's partly the reason for it not getting five stars. But it also adds a sweetness to an already bitter story. BEFORE I DIE completely caught me off guard. I finished it very heavy hearted and sad. Noticing how there was sunshine outside after what seemed like forever, I stuck my head out my widow and just stood there for some time trying to make sense of it all. How I was standing here, strong and alive when this girl deteriorated day after day. Where is the fairness in that? And it's so simple. it's not OK. And it's not fair. But it's the cruel way of life. I am so in awe of Tessa. Of her ability to take her condition on the chin and try to live life to the fullest, to never give up and want and want and want until his love for her consumes her. There is so much wanting in her. She wants so much to marry, have children, go university, travel the world that it makes you think - how the hell can I not appreciate these things and not take on the world? I guess the fact that this book is all kinds of beautiful factors hugely in my love for it. Just read it. My favourite quotes :) \u201cIt's utterly beautiful not to know my own edges.\u201d \u201cShe'll understand what I already know - that death surrounds us all. And it tastes like metal between your teeth.\u201d \u201cI want the people I love to get up and speak about me, and even if you cry it'll be OK. I want you to say honest things.\u201d \u201cThere's a terrible stillness. I notice a small tear in the wallpaper above her shoulder. I notice finger marks grimed on the light switch. Somewhere down in the house, a door opens and shuts. As Zoey turns to face me, I realize that life is made up of a series of moments, each one a journey to the end.\u201d \u201cCal says that humans are made from the nuclear ash of dead stars. He says that when I die, I'll return to dust, glitter,rain. If thats true, I want to be buried right here under this tree. Its roots will reach into the soft mess of my body and suck me dry. I'll be re-formed as apple blossom. I'll drift down in the spring like confetti and cling to my family's shoes. They'll carry me in their pockets to help them sleep. What dreams will they have then?\u201d \u201cAll I know is that I have two choices \u2013 stay wrapped in blankets and get on with dying, or get the list back together and get on with living.\u201d \u201cWe said we'd be friends.' He looks confused. 'Yeah.' I don't want to be.' There's space between us, and in that space there's darkness. I take another step, so close that we share a breath. The same one. In and out. Tess,' he says. I know it's a warning, but I don't care. What's the worst thing that can happen?' It'll hurt,' he says. It already hurts.' \u201cI wish I had a boyfriend. I wish he lived in the wardrobe on a coat hanger. Whenever I wanted, I could get him out and he'd look at me the way boys do in films, as if I'm beautiful.\u201d I don't want to be dead. I haven't been loved like this way for long enough. ...more \u201cKeep breathing. Just keep doing it. It's easy.

WARNING- I cried from 2% all the way to 95%. I didn't cry at the very end. How screwed up am I? I cried not because Tessa was dying but because she was so well loved. The numerous acts of unselfish (and some selfish) raw love made my heart break apart. I promise you the dying in this book is not the story. It's about how to finally live when you have an expiration date. Beautiful. I always said that there must be better books out there than The Fault in Our Stars by John Green when tackling teenage cancer in a novel. And there was. I have just read it. Tessa is a young teenager and she's being ravaged by Leukemia, she has battled it for years of her young life and now things are not going so well. The sand in the timer is falling faster. I've been ill for so long, puffed up and sick, with patchy skin, flaky fingernails, disappearing hair and a feeling of nausea Beautiful. I always said that there must be better books out there than The Fault in Our Stars by John Green when tackling teenage cancer in a novel. And there was. I have just read it. Tessa is a young teenager and she's being ravaged by Leukemia, she has battled it for years of her young life and now things are not going so well. The sand in the timer is falling faster. I've been ill for so long, puffed up and sick, with patchy skin, flaky fingernails, disappearing hair and a feeling of nausea that permeates to my bonds, it's not fair. I don't want to die like this, not before I've even loved properly. It seems so clear to me. I feel almost hopeful, which is mad. I want to live before I die. It's the only thing that makes sense. This book doesn't skip a beat and gets straight into things, Tessa is making a list of things she wants to do before she dies, on that list are things like have sex and take drugs. Not many books tackle sex so quickly (in the first 20 pages) as this book did in the way that it did. Tessa is very well presented as a teenager, she has her moods, she acts immature and selfish at times, her character is very real, not an ounce of fake about this girl. She is at times brutally honest with herself and others about her predicament. Around Tessa the cast of characters include her Mother and Father who are separated but pulling together for Tessa, her young brother Cal and her best friend Zoe. Zoe is the one friend who does not treat her different because she is sick and dying, they have an intense friendship with a lot of typical teenage push and pull. I loved the way this book was written, I felt so many emotions whilst reading it, something that The Fault in Our Stars had not done for me. I have seen what cancer does to a young person (and old) and how it alters thinking processes, bodily functions, personalities all around the sick person. This book presented all sides to it, no holding back. There are so many beautiful moments in the book as I journeyed with Tess as she worked to get through her list of things to do (some a little crazy!), things most teens would want to experience if they were going to die by sixteen. I smiled with her when she did and I ached for her when her heart ached. I applauded her when she showed courage. It's a profoundly beautiful novel, I won't forget this one ever , I can't believe I had never heard of it (I found a copy of this book in a local charity shop for 80p). I read it in less than two hours, just turning the pages and soaking it all in. I can't reveal special spoilers but this book takes a twist that I just loved, it melted my heart , I felt everything with Tessa. And by golly, the ending, oh my goodness!, I choked up, I shed tears, I was so with the moment. Books hardly ever make me actually that emotional so this was special. A book that reminded me of my own mortality but also that I am still alive, and to grab it and maybe start my list before it's too late. Cancer is a ravager of the body and soul. Tessa's journey was brilliantly represented, I truly found this to be a heart-warming, poignant, emotional and powerful book. Stunning. ...more While it started out rather slowly, about halfway through, it definitely picked up. I feel like it could have been so much more though. It could have been something absolutely phenomenal and some parts just fell a bit short. But I will say this, I definitely cried.

I picked up Before I Die with huge hopes and expectations. I had just finished reading Jenny Downham's You Against Me which was utterly brilliant but Before I Die simply didn't do it for me. Sixteen-year-old Tessa doesn't have a very long time left to live. Suffering from leukemia, Tessa decides to make a list of things she wants to do before she dies. On this list is everything from sex, to drugs, to driving, and even breaking the law. Then, there's Adam, her mysterious neighbor. Throughout Tessa's ordeal, she must learn to accept her situation, herself, and her life for what it is. I'm going to start by saying some of the positive aspects of this novel. Tessa's reactions to her cancer and her behavior seemed very realistic and Downham's portrayal of her relationship with her family was extremely well written and believable. However, I simply could not bring myself to care for Tessa. Furthermore, I was thoroughly confused as to why Adam was even remotely interested in her. Tessa's friendship with Zoey seemed fake and fell flat. All in all, I didn't enjoy reading this book even a quarter as much as I loved Downham's You Against Me. That being said, Before I Die wasn't necessarily a bad book and the second half may be better than the first half, but I won't be wasting my time reading it. (Note: If this is your first cancer book then it may be a very good read. I constantly kept comparing Before I Die to John Green's The Fault in Our Stars and the two stories simply could not be compared as The Fault in Our Stars affected me on a completely new and profound level that Before I Die could not do. As far as debut novels go however, this was definitely an excellent attempt by Downham.) ...more Tessa was diagnosed with terminal leukemia at the age of twelve. Her friends and friends of her family sent her gifts and get well soon cards, probably expecting her to get better after a few treatments and maybe some radiation chemotherapy. Four years later, at age sixteen, Tessa knows she is going to die in just a few months. Not wanting to live the rest of her life in bed doing nothing, Tessa compiles a list of things she wants to do before she dies.

Her friends and friends of her family sent her gifts and get well soon cards, probably expecting her to get better after a few treatments and maybe some radiation chemotherapy. Four years later, at age sixteen, Tessa knows she is going to die in just a few months. Not wanting to live the rest of her life in bed doing nothing, Tessa compiles a list of things she wants to do before she dies. The objectives on the list are racy and meant to make her feel alive; things like sex, drugs, and fame. Even though Tessa might achieve her goals, she will soon learn that maybe getting all the things she desire won't bring her happiness, and that maybe it is the unexpected joys of life that will. Before I Die is a tear-jerker. It was somewhat like watching a reality TV show - you watch all the characters develop and get to know them even when you already know during the finale they're going to die. Not eloquently stated, but true. And that's exactly what happened. Not to put down any other parts of the book, but the ending was infinitely painful and heart-breaking, I felt like someone I really knew in real life was passing away, not just a fictional character. There isn't much to be said (because it's that good) about Before I Die . Once starting the novel it's obvious what fate will befall Tessa. Regardless, you're immediately sucked into her sad story. Her emotions, thoughts, and actions are extremely well-described. Her family, her friend Zoey, and lover Adam are all brought to life and three-dimensional. Basically, I think Before I Die is a great example of everything a book should be. By the way, keep a few tissues (or the whole box) with you when you reach the last few chapters. You'll need them. ...more If you need a reminder of all that's important in this world, then you should read this novel. Even if you don't think so. The title says it all.

But those are also the ones that touch me the most. Tessa has cancer. She has been fighting cancer for the past 4 years, and now only has months to live. She wants to make the most of the time she has, and so she makes a \"Before I Die\" list, a list of all the things she wants to do before she dies. What would you do?

I for one, would probably want to spend all my time with loved ones, although I don\u2019t think you can assume what a person would want in such a time unless it\u2019s actually happening (God forbid). Tessa doesn\u2019t play a weepy, whiny character who thinks the world should revolve around her since she\u2019s about to die. In fact, she\u2019s kind of a bitch. She\u2019s blunt, honest, knows what she wants and does anything possible to get it, because, well, life is short. First up is sex, then drugs, shoplifting, fame, love, etc. So you all know what will happen in the end. She\u2019ll die. The end, right? What you don\u2019t know is that it\u2019ll break your heart along the way. There are quite a few heartbreaking quotes, but this one touched me the most: Tessa\u2019s words to her dad: \u2018No, then you\u2019ll die. Before me. The way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u2019 Whenever I hear of a child dying anywhere in the world, it always hurts. It\u2019s so sad to think of someone dying before they get to see how wonderful life could be, had they had the time to enjoy it. Tessa tries her best to enjoy whatever time is left. But there\u2019s only so much you can do. She can\u2019t finish school, she can never go to university, so many things that normal teenagers look forward to. She\u2019s just not given a chance. That\u2019s the worst part. When reading, and growing to know Tessa better and liking her, you realize that there\u2019s nothing you can do for her. You\u2019re not going to get a happy ending. ...and live. ...more I have just finnished this book and I write this review through tears.

In her last months she makes a list of 10 things she wants to do before she dies (this includes falling in love and saying yes to everything for one whole day). Tessa goes through a range of emotions including anger (why her?) but the overriding feeling I got from her was an amazing spirit. She notices things that you and I forget to notice - the colour of leaves, the sound of a thunder storm, sunshine reflecting in a tea cup. These are the things that make her feel alive and she embraces them in a way that most of us who think we have years left infront of us don't. This is a beautifully written and important book.

Un libro sobre no tener miedo, nunca cuestionar o estar enojado con la vida o como te ha tratado. Lo que encontr\u00e9 fue un personaje fuerte, una chica que a veces es atrevida, que de verdad quiere vivir la vida plenamente, mientras que todav\u00eda la tiene. Tessa quiere experimentar cosas buenas como: Enamorarse de un chico que realmente quiere. Y cosas malas como: Drogas y tener relaciones sexuales con un extra\u00f1o azar. Ella est\u00e1 enojada por todo lo que tiene que pasar. Realmente va a suceder. Realmente no volver\u00e9 a la escuela nunca. Nunca voy a ser famosa o algo que valga la pena dejar atr\u00e1s. Nunca voy a ir a la universidad o tendr\u00e9 un trabajo. No voy a ver a mi hermano crecer. No voy a viajar, no voy a ganar dinero, no conducir\u00e9 nunca, nunca me enamorar\u00e9 o saldr\u00e9 de casa o tendr\u00e9 mi propia casa. Es realmente cierto. Y lo que simplemente le dio el toque magn\u00edfico al libro fue la forma en que Tessa se enfrenta a su muerte, algo que hace al libro m\u00e1s real. Ella tiene miedo que no haya nada despu\u00e9s de la muerte, ella tiene miedo de ser olvidada y enterrada. Est\u00e1 molesta porque ella tiene que morir mientras sus amigos y familiares pueden seguir con sus vidas y a\u00fan as\u00ed se las arregla para ser feliz con el tiempo que tiene. El \u00fanico personaje que realmente me gustaba era Adam. No s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 se enamor\u00f3 de Tessa, porque ella ni siquiera se lo merec\u00eda. Hubo algunas escenas con \u00e9l estando ah\u00ed para ella y d\u00e1ndole todo su cari\u00f1o, que me hicieron quererlo m\u00e1s. Me sent\u00ed triste por \u00e9l, realmente, porque Tessa iba a morir y ese era el final para ella, pero \u00e9l se acordar\u00e1 de ella toda su vida. Y bueno, el pap\u00e1 de Tessa qui\u00e9n me gusto solo un poco. Cosas que odio de este libro: Zoey, \"amiga\" de Tessa , mejor conocida como la tonta que la ayud\u00f3 con su lista: Personalmente la odio por no estar para Tessa cuando la necesitaba y por recordarle cada vez que se ve\u00edan que ella iba a morir y eso. Odiaba a su hermano peque\u00f1o por decirle que \u00e9l no pod\u00eda esperar hasta que ella se haya ido. Odiaba a su madre , quien parec\u00eda no preocuparse por ella en absoluto. Esta bien, hay un mont\u00f3n cosas que no me gustaron en este libro. Quit\u00e1ndole toda la cosa de los personajes secundarios, este es un libro que te hace pensar y apreciar la vida. ...more I read this in a day - I couldn't put it down.

The book is beautifully written, and brings about a number of emotions. The characters are well established (Tessa's father particularly) and this makes the story realistic and believable. It's interesting to learn about the relationships between the characters - you'd imagine that most kids would turn to their parents in a situation like this, however Tessa has a slight resentment towards her father - she thinks he's holding her back and being too overprotective. I felt that the book captured Tessa's emotions well - she's dying, yet she refuses to let that stop her doing what she wants to do. She's very selfish at times, but then I suppose in this situation who wouldn't be at some point? She's not scared of death (most of the time) and just wants to get on with enjoying the rest of the time she has left. I thought the relationship with Adam was well written, and developed beautifully. Even though I knew what the ending would be, it still didn't stop me blubbing through the last 20 pages or so. I became really attached to Tessa, and it broke my heart when she died, but I loved the way in which it was written - it seemed to capture so many of Tessa's emotions. I chose to read this book because I like authors who deal with subjects that others are afraid to touch. Jenny Downham has done a wonderful job and I hope there are more books like this to come. ...more I'd heard a little about this book when I started reading it. Not much, but mostly good things.

But it's so worth it. ...more 5 *Before I...* stars vodili smo ljubav dvadeset sedam puta i delili postelju \u0161ezdeset dve no\u0107i a to je mnogo ljubavi we made love twenty-seven times and we shared a bed for sixty-two nights and that\u2019s a lot of love \"Zahvalan sam ti.\" \"Na \u010demu?\" \"\u0160to nisi uzmakao.Ve\u0107ina momaka bi ve\u0107 odavno pobegla.\" \"Volim je.\" \"I\u2019m grateful to you.\" \"For what?\" \"For not backing off.

Es m\u00e1s recuerdo que Adam, el amor de Tessa, de la pelicula era mucho m\u00e1s adorable y sacaba m\u00e1s suspiros que el del libro. La historia esta contada en forma de como ella va cumpliendo los deseos uno a uno y luego, se desarrolla una reconstituci\u00f3n de sus recuerdos en base a como los sintomas se agudizan y ella agoniza. Es bastante superficial el relato, en momentos generas cierta empat\u00eda con Tessa y te compadeces por su situaci\u00f3n; pero hay otros en que ella se vuelve completamente insoportable por la necesidad reiterativa de que la complazcan y esten a su servicio por la enfermedad, como si ella fuera la unica humana en el planeta con problemas. Para ser la primera novela de la autora, no esta nada mal. Cosas que me gustaron: Cal, el hermano menor de Tessa .. el sufrimiento oculto de \u00e9l se apega mucho a la realidad, y Zoey, la mejor amiga de Tessa, por decirle todas las cosas a la cara por ser tan insoportable (Siempre me la imagine como Kaya Scodelario, nunca como la describio la autora ): ) ...more I really didn't like this book.

I'm sorry, but if I was dying, I wouldn't be thinking about sex all the time. I wouldn't. But throughout the whole book, it is just about sex. Sex, sex and more sex. One part cancer, five thousand parts sex. I may be the only teenager out there who doesn't want to read about sex, but it's true. Book should have more meaning to them, especially when it is about a girl who is dying. I mean, if I wanted to read a book about sex, I would get one of those adult novels, not a bucketlist book. I do like how her list changes to everyday things, but still I feel like it was a waste of a read, and I am forever stuck with the mental images of horrible those sex scenes.
