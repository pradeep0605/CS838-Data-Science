I started reading around 10:30 last night and finished up around 1:30 this morning. I did look at the clock several times and contemplated going to sleep but sleep was not nearly as compelling as finishing the book. Sometimes, series tend to get old and the characters stale. Not so in this series. Stephanie, while still far from the best bounty hunter around, is getting better at her job. There are always new characters who add to the story and the recurring characters have stories of their own so it's not always just about Stephanie, Joe and Ranger. Hmmmmm, Ranger. The summary: Ranger becomes a nationally wanted man after it's reported that he kidnapped his daughter from her Mother and Stepfather. Stephanie hides him out and helps him in his quest to clear his name and rescue the girl. Along the way,<---M> we have the expected</---M>, and entertaining, funeral home stories, Lulu and Grandma shenanigans, less than stellar skip captures and we learn more about Ranger. Hmmmmm, Ranger. Evanovich does a great job of balancing the humor (<---B>lots of stun gunning (trust me, it's funny</---B>), Stephanie falling down, Stephanie getting tackled, Lulu busting out of her clothes, etc.) with a mystery that has a very menacing feel about it. You don't ever expect that Stephanie's going to be killed off at any moment but you also don't expect she'll emerge from her adventures fully unscathed, either. ...more Yes, they are formulaic.

They decide to practice at Stephanie\u2019s during dinner and all Dad wants to do is watch the Yankees, but the noise, the costumes (Grandma is wearing a studded color and an ice cream cone bra, you get the picture) are driving him to a state Morelli can only describe as similar to victims of a multiple vehicle accident. Very funny scene. The only thing worrying me is that I suspect Grandma Mazur isn\u2019t much older than I. That truly sucks. In this volume, a Ranger wanna-be is stalking him and kidnaps his daughter, trying to become a pseudo-Ranger. He\u2019s killing people who get in the way; but who cares about the plot. We read these for quirky and very funny characters. A final note. Several of the one-star reviewers on Amazon complained that Stephanie was immoral and needs to stop sleeping with both Ranger and Morelli. That\u2019s interesting because I had the sense (and my wife agrees) that that is not at all the case and that she has remained faithful to Morelli. Yes, in this one she \u201csleeps\u201d with Ranger, but only literally and Platonicly. So to those who think Stephanie is immoral, get over it and go back to your Harlequins. ...more Lots of Ranger in one of these books always makes me give an extra star.

It seems reasonable since they are really really together. And yet, Stephanie is often kissing Ranger. So, she's crossing lines all over the place. But, there are always reasons why it's not really her fault because Ranger kisses her, or whatever, so maybe we are supposed to be okay with it even though she got divorced the first time because her husband cheated on her. You would think that this would make her not want to do that to someone else. But, you would think wrong! Because, Stephanie and Ranger cross a line in this book that has them naked in her bed while Morelli is knocking on the door. Bad Stephanie! She needs to either break it off with Joe or send Ranger over to my house or something so she won't be tempted anymore. ...more If there is one thing you can count on with the Stephanie Plum series, it is that you are going to have a laugh until your stomach hurts, good time.

While this twelve installment is just as funny, just as good as all the others, it is also a little more serious than what we are use to but in a really good way. The stakes are higher, lives are on the line and this time, those lives, are people we know and love. I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this was and how it gave me exactly what I needed (a reading pick me up) just when I needed it. Between crazy Grandma M and Lula who I adore (oh my gosh the rock n' roll band and thongs! Seriously enough said, just read it already!) , and the sexy Ranger and Morelli, this series really does deliver on all counts of fun. If you haven't tried this series yet and need a lighter but still mystery filled, action packed, humor ridden, heart pounding good time, try this series. I don't think you will be disappointed, at. All. ...more At first I was pretty disappointed in Twelve Sharp because it wasn't hilarious. All of the other Stephanie Plum novels were super funny.

Again, the answer is no. When she is ready, she will pick a man\u2026 I hope. And if she \u201cgrew\u201d any more than I can hardly believe she would be the same as she is in these books. This is another hit in the series (which is by far, one of my favorite series of all time). If you haven\u2019t read it yet, start with One for the Money. I am sure you will get just as hooked as I was! ...more My absolute favorite of the series thus far! 12 is a wonderful balance of humor and tension, with a determinedly different plotline.

Dame Janet is a little more lively although, perhaps less literaturelyesque. At least she keeps me awake. Either way, once you begin her series, like a tube of Pringles, you must work your way to the bottom, or end as it may be. Once, I read everything I could find written by Thomas Hardy (I was a strange kid). This would not be the same. Stephanie Plum is to literature as ketchup is to steak\u2014the brain says don\u2019t do it, but the taste buds say go ahead. If you have read the others, but not this one, beware: this is the book where two Rangers appear. No kidding. There are two of them\u2014and there\u2019s a run on black military gear at the local SWAT stores. Lula joins a rock band with recurring character heterosexual transvestite school bus driver (au contraire, I kid you not) and Grandma Mazur joins in a couple sets. Then there was the time I read everything of Stephen Isherwood (talk about a snooze). As long as Morelli keeps the Plum orgasms coming (ooh, I\u2019m sorry) and Bob the Dog keep regurgitating like the author, I guess I can keep going on this series. Shut up. They\u2019re fun. ...more First, I\u2019ll admit a personal weakness: I actually laughed several times when reading one of the Stephanie Plum books last year. But that was last year, and a couple Stephanie Plum books ago.

I got it! I too can write could write a Stephanie Plum book! Let\u2019s see\u2026 Ah! (Annoying) Stephanie Plum dies in (insert whatever comical accident she routinely gets involved in, like apartment or car blow-up), and everyone has a party at the local funeral home, with cookies and refreshments, and, oops!, grandma Mazur \u201caccidentally\u201d opens the casket and mayhem ensues, haha! Another fun scenario: since (annoying) Stephanie Plum can\u2019t choose between the two men in her life, Joe Morelli, the nice policeman, and Ranger, the dangerous bounty hunter (yawn!), they somehow all move in together (due to usual apartment explosion), and trouble ensues\u2026or not! Ranger and Morelli find out they like each other, and dump (annoying) Stephanie Plum. Or else, my favorite: (annoying) Stephanie Plum gains 200 pounds from eating so many donuts and cheeseburgers; as a result, she can\u2019t be a body hunter anymore, and ends up a couch potato with a bad perm, eating Twinkies while watching World Wide Wrestling matches on TV. ...more Hilarious, A Little Dark & Refreshing!!! Still Loving It!!! I'm thinking this one is by far my favorite in the series, and not just because of Ranger. Well, OK. Mostly because of Ranger. In this installment, Stephanie, Lula, and Connie are up to their eyeballs in FTA's.

Things have gotten so bad that Connie is forced to put an ad in the paper for an extra agent. Trouble is, everyone and their mother are showing up to apply. In true Evanovich fashion, most show up wearing ass-less chaps...and not much else :D Aside from working a heavy caseload, something strange is happening concerning Ranger. When a woman claiming to be Ranger's wife confronts Stephanie, gun in hand, things start getting a little crazy. When Ranger hits the television news, crazy turns to Serious Business. Now Stephanie is working her buns off trying to keep the business open, dragged into the middle of a Ranger-mess, and has picked up a stalker along the way. Nothing is ever easy for Stephanie Plum. This twelfth installment once again delivered all of the hilarity I expect from Janet Evanovich and Stephanie Plum. Sally Sweet is back again and has started a new group, signing on Lula and Grandma Mazur in the process. As if that weren't enough, they mostly play for old folks in retirement homes. A 7-foot drag queen who's harrier than a Wookie, and has taken to performing in just a thong; a big woman who favors small-woman clothes; combined with Grandma Mazur, The What truly makes for a band of misfits. And not one of them can sing. Stephanie is once again wrestling her feelings for two men and while nothing really progresses on that front, it sure is fun. As I've said before, I'm rather indifferent when it comes to love triangles, but I honestly love the one between Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger. I don't mind if it's never resolved because I'm sure that would take some fun out of these novels. Another highlight was Joyce Barnhardt, the woman everyone loves to hate. Hate her or not, her interactions with everyone in the office make for some good times. Especially when she's barking with Vinnie. I'm having such fun with finally getting around to the series that everyone but me has read. These books are so much fun, seriously, and I can't get enough. While nothing ever happens concerning character growth and development and all of that other important stuff, it doesn't make a difference to me one way or the other. I don't want growth and development and change, I like them just the way they are -- dependable and consistent, just like the 'Burg. ...more First, I would like to say that a.

I figured, it's book twelve of a series, there must be something redeeming or else she couldn't have gotten so far, plus it's set in Jersey (Trenton area) and that's always great. :) There were some interesting characters, such as Lula the former \"'ho\" (her spelling, not min) and the other employees of the bond agency were main character, Stephanie Plum, works, but the tantalizing men in her life? I'd take Morelli's (who she disconcertingly refers to as Joe TWICE, but that might be because she is on book 12 of this bizarre crime-laden love triangle) dog, Bob, over him. Bad boy Ranger isn't particularly exciting either (not just saying this because she gyps on sex scenes and has painfully not-sexy banter). Thanks to Evanovich's extraordinarily detailed fantasy life, however, I can picture exactly what he looks like. Now that I see what all the fuss is about, I can assure you that I won't be reading any more of her novels. The mystery of who Stephanie finally settles down with will just remain unsolved for me. ...more This is a hard book to rate. I disliked the beginning and almost quit reading it. There was too much sleaze and foul language for my taste. I am very glad that I kept reading because the actual mystery and its effect on the regular characters was great, one of the best, if not the best in the series so far. Added bonus: the almost obligatory hilarious dinner scene at the Plum residence will be hard to top in future books. I refuse to apologize for loving these books :-) Still fun, popcorn entertainment Loved it. Okay, here's the thing: I used to love this series with every fibre of my being.

And when you add in the ridiculousness of the between the numbers novellas, I've basically been on the verge of giving up on rereading these books for a really long time. But I own the series through book 16, and I thought I needed to give them the benefit of the doubt. Until I started this one. I made it all the way to page 8 and I read something that filled me with so much rage that I finally reached breaking point. And that something was this: Not that long ago I needed a safe place to stay and sort of commandeered Ranger's apartment when he was out of town. Ranger had come home and found me sleeping in his bed like Goldilocks. He'd very graciously not thrown me out the seventh-floor window. And in fact he'd allowed me to stay with a minimum of sexual harassment. Okay, maybe minimum isn't entirely accurate. Maybe it was a seven on a scale of ten, but he hadn't forced the issue. STEPH. GIRL. Are you seriously giving Ranger credit for NOT FORCING YOU TO SLEEP WITH HIM AS PAYMENT FOR USING HIS APARTMENT WHEN YOU WERE BEING CHASED BY MURDERERS???? What in the actual fuck. I can put up with a lot of shit in books, but not this. I'm done with this series. Everything after book 7 is taking a trip to the second hand shop. ...more Security expert and bounty hunter Ranger is used to catching wanted people, but now he's the one who is wanted. There's a woman looking for him who claims she is married to him. He has another big problem - someone who looks a lot like him has kidnapped his daughter.

On top of that, she's being stalked by someone who wants everything that Ranger has, including Stephanie. \"Twelve Sharp\" is an extremely funny book and much better than the last Stephanie Plum book, \"Eleven on Top\". Most of the regular characters are included: Stephanie's parents, Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's on and off boyfriend Joe Morelli, Lula, Connie, and Sally Sweet are all there. Readers will be happy that Janet Evanovich gives a little more insight into the mysterious Ranger's private life. Evanovich adds a new character, Melvin Pickle, who brings a lot of fun to the book. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially when Connie, Lula, and Stephanie interview potential bounty hunters. Some of the captures that Lula and Stephanie make are equally funny. Evanovich wisely ditches some of the tired plot lines such as Stephanie's car always being blown up and breathes new life into other plot lines - especially an incredibly funny scene during a wake. Unfortunately, she does add a food fight scene - something that I wish could be banned from all books and movies! Still, most of the book is hilarious, even the tension filled ending has laugh out loud moments. ...more This is the twelfth in the numbered series about the continuing adventures of Stephanie Plum, who is still (as always) trying to make up her mind between Joe Morrelli, the cop who took her virginity behind the counter of the bakery at which she was working when she was sixteen (in response to which she drove her car up onto the sidewalk to nail him a few years later and broke his leg) and Ranger, a \u201creal\u201d bounty hunter, who is not the marrying type but is strong, dark, silent, dangerous, and mys This is the twelfth in the numbered series about the continuing adventures of Stephanie Plum, who is still (as always) trying to make up her mind between Joe Morrelli, the cop who took her virginity behind the counter of the bakery at which she was working when she was sixteen (in response to which she drove her car up onto the sidewalk to nail him a few years later and broke his leg) and Ranger, a \u201creal\u201d bounty hunter, who is not the marrying type but is strong, dark, silent, dangerous, and mysterious to the core.

It's one thing to make a move on her when she is in the off-again phase of her relationship, but she keeps telling him no, and he keeps at her anyway.

Lula recruits Grandma Mazur for the band she just joined; Connie is interviewing bounty hunters from hell; Tank feels the love; and a pervy Pickle joins the company. Oh, and there's a very close call in the Plum bedroom! ...more The mystery of Ranger is explored, and wow! Evanovich has a way of twisting you around so you laugh out loud at one moment and suck in your breath at the next. Twelve Sharp has a more than its fair share of these moments. A rollercoaster ride the whole time, and no one is left out. A fan favorite for sure. Three magic words are said by the end and yes, this book is smoking hot. Favorite quote/phrase: \"I try hard not to do things that are stupid. I'm willing to make an exception in this case. I'm n The mystery of Ranger is explored, and wow!

So Joe decides that he needs to stand between the untrustworthy Ranger and his kind of slutty girlfriend Stephanie.

When will my Christmas presents be done? ...more Oh my word. Pick a side, would you? And make it Morelli...because picking Ranger would be stupid. Really, Janet...your readership will not fall apart if she makes a choice. Let them evolve. Please?

Here's hoping that 16 (or is it 17?) starts to resolve the weirdness. Please? ...more Lots of strong action in this installment in the Stephanie Plum series, but short on laughs. I don't really like Evanovich's continued chipping away at the Ranger mystique: I preferred the early days when he would swing in, save Stephanie from a sticky situation, make a joke and a steamy comment, and leave -- the days when Lula would watch CNN to see what Central American country had a coup whenever Ranger left town. Evanovich never disappoints- Twelve Sharp is an all out belly laugh, hold you sides and hope you are not drinking coffee while reading because you will spit out your coffee. Spoiler alert- her description of her family and her boyfriend at the dinner table is a classic. Don't miss this one if you are depressed-will bring you out of your doldrums. Another huge 5 stars for Evanovich. Twitter review (140 characters of less): Ranger is forever my favourite male character after this book. I could not stop reading it. It's funny, intense, and sometimes really sad. Je me suis bien amus\u00e9e une fois de plus !", "Title": "Twelve Sharp"},
