This book has it all: character and relationship development, and action packed plot. Basically, this book was the bomb: The book picks up from where we were at The Son of Neptune . We finally, finally get to see Percybeth reunited an entertaining fashion (view spoiler) [ Annabeth flips Percy on his back and demands he never, ever leave her again (hide spoiler) ] . However, the reunion is cut short when, in typical demi-god style, not everything goes according to plan. Thus, within 20 pages of the book we already have some action! After the mishaps (view spoiler) [ <---C>Leo</---C> firing at Camp Jupiter (hide spoiler) ] , our heroes begin the quest. Told from four alternating perspectives, this book is all about the quest of sailing to the ancient land (ie. Rome) to find the Doors of Death. On the way, the characters go on mini-quests and then report back in the Argo II. In these mini-quests we really get a feel for the characters. The character development in this book was gold. Jason, who I've never really liked, gained my respect. Piper, who is cool but a damsel in distress changes our perception of her. Leo by default is awesome but in this book he becomes very relatable (view spoiler) [ particularly with his 'odd man out' situation (hide spoiler) ] . Percy, who we think we know, we see from different angels that give us more understanding of him as a character. We really empathize with Hazel and Frank in their complicated situations. Despite all these good characters, Annabeth stole the show. She has always been brave and intelligent but in this book she really demonstrates just how brave and intelligent she is. Basically, if you didn't like certain characters before hand, you at the very least respect them by the end.<---F> And if you don't: Just kidding</---F>. People are entitled to their own opinions. Talking about character development: relationship development. Percybeth in this book was different. Typically, they have a \"lighthearted, awkward, teasing relationship.\" In this book we see Annabeth distance herself from everyone because she needs to be secretive. Percy is still the same but he develops a major fear and grows slightly weary of the hero life. As a result of the character changes, the relationship changes. I can see how people don't like these changes but I personally applaud them because it shows Percy and Annabeth are growing up and maturing. The other relationship which was developed was Jasper. You can see how they are sort of perfect for each other. On the other hand, I can see the issues with their relationship because: 1) Piper likes Jason for what she wants him to be 2) Jason is impassive. If you don't like the relationship and character development there is lots of action. We have our usual selection of monsters which our heroes fight them off with their God given powers. I particularly liked that the heroes didn't just try to brute force beat an opponent. If the other person was stronger, faster, or just genuinely better, the hero would use their intelligence to beat them. In this book you understand what that, \"being a hero doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re invincible. It just means that you\u2019re brave enough to stand up and do what\u2019s needed.\" Finally, the plot in this book was... different. Generally, Riordan's plots are formulamatic: Hero receives a prophecy and completes it (albeit, not according to plan and just in time). In The Mark of Athena there are three prophecies which are stated in a slightly confusing fashion which makes it hard for you as the reader to really grasp all of them (although, I did read this at 12 am - my brain wasn't functioning at it's potential). Despite this, we do know that there is a basic plot: find the Doors of Death. It could be argued that that is really all we need. To summarise, this book was good like the get-off-your-butt-and-go-buy-a-copy, page turning, this-should-be-more-popular good!

Rick Riordan hasn't failed me yet. His characters are still what I love about his books the most. Okay, so I know that I said that I disliked Jason and Piper before, but they're growing on me.(At least Piper is. Jason, I'm still not sure about. Something about that guy says traitor to me.... Am I the only one?) But everyone else, Percy, Annabeth, Hazel, Frank and Leo, I absolutely loved . I have to say though, I expected more relationships built during the course of 500 + pages. Like some nice siblingy relationships or some tension, like with Percy and Jason for example. I felt like there were opportunities for them to have gotten to know each other more, like Piper and Hazel, or Leo and Percy, or Frank and Jason. But I suppose in their defense, they DID have to fight off monsters and enemies 82% of the time. (view spoiler) [Frank, Hazel and Leo, though. I am so torn about them! On one hand, I find Hazel and Leo absolutely adorable together (although the Sammy thing DID kinda freak with my mind), but then I'd feel so sorry for Frank if this happens! UGGGG. Love triangles. You hate 'em and you love 'em. Riordan did pretty good on this part of the story and I'm definitely looking forward to how their relationship will blossom in the next books. (hide spoiler) ] Leo. He was, by far my favourite character of the series (aside from Percy, of course, but I think that's a given). He was funny, charming, but flawed and down to earth which made me love him more. (view spoiler) [I hated what Nemesis told him though. How he's always be the seventh wheel and that he won't find his place within his brethren. It just makes me want to root for him more. Sigh. (hide spoiler) ] The amount of action in the book was great, not too little and not too much. I love, though, how the demigods usually win their fights because of their wits and not just their skill in fighting. I think that's a nice message to have. The only thing I was bothered by in the book, aside from the lack of relationship buildups, was probably being in Annabeth's perspective. It's just that, not hearing from her side of the story for so long (7 books in total may I say, 5 in Percy Jackson and the Olympians and 2 from The Heroes of Olympus), it was weird finally seeing what was going on in that head of hers. Especially when she was talking about Percy. I don't really know. It was just odd, like I guess that since we never got a view in her head for so long before, that I made up what Annabeth was thinking and it didn't necessarily match what Riordan wrote. Anyway, there wasn't really anything that I disliked about the book aside from the two points I mentioned before, which I pretty much just overlooked because the plot was excellent and the characters were just brilliant. That cliffhanger, though. I do not like the idea of waiting another year.

When I finished this book a while ago, I would log onto Goodreads every single day and every single day, I would look at my pre-review and think, how can I write this review? What should I include, what should I put emphasis on? I would simply just stare at my laptop's screen until my mom called me down for dinner. I wish I could write this review to the high calibar it deserves. I wish I could write this review that could do this book justice, a review that would please all the people who 'liked' my pre-review. I wish, I wish so badly, that I could write a review that would be able to express how badly I loved this book, how much I sobbed when I read that damned ending and how I just couldn't contain a fan-girl squel everytime Percy and Annabeth shared a kiss. Unfortunately, my wish cannot come true. Dare I say it, I believe no one can write a review justice for this book. It's just not possible. But of course, it wouldn't be like me not to try ... I haven't read a good book in a long time. Far too overdue. Luckily, Mark of Athena was the perfect book to solve my problem. It wasn't just good . It was amazing-I-would-marry-this-book-if-I-could sort of good. This book though, should definitely come with a warning like this, right on the front page: WARNING: Reading will cause excessive sobs/laughs and an extreme conflict of emotions. Riordan is able to toy with your brain and make you cry when you thought you were happy and make you laugh when you should have been sad. It's confusing, it still confuses me but it is also amazing. My emotions no longer were controlled by me, but controlled by this book. Can you imagine that? A book controlling my emotions, an inanimate object controlling my emotions? But that's the beauty of a well-written book, it stops being inanimate, the words start to come to life. Or perhaps I am over-thinking this and Riordan just takes pleasure in watching his fans have their minds blown. Another helpful warning tip: Be prepared to have no other book be able to captivate you again, or at least for a very long time. After reading this book, I wandered around aimlessly at my library, glancing over the pretty cover arts and the interesting titles but none being able to fully capture my attention. For once, in all my years of existance, I left the library empty-handed. Why? Because I was still living in the world of fantasy, in the world where Greek Gods were real and that demi-gods walked the Earth. When you read Mark of Athena, you'll leave your ordinary life. I left my reality of homework and tests and school and entered a world of action and humour and overall awesomeness. And don't we all want to just escape reality for a little, and experience some awesomeness? I know I do. But let's move on to the meat of the review ... My Speculations - How off was I? Speculation: Percy and Annabeth will reunite and share a kiss. Reality: OH YEAH! They sure reunited and their reunion was everything the fans could have asked for. It was tres romantic without going overboard. And my little idea that they could have a kiss every single chapter didn't come true, but Percy and Annabeth SURE kissed a lot. Percabeth kiss count: I'm tallying it up but I'm predicting over 10. I'll update soon (if I don't, you have the right to spam my account!) Speaking of Percabeth, this book definitely had it's fair share in the lime light. There were numerous mentions of it throughout the book and I couldn't be more pleased. Even that ending, was Percabeth. I know, I know, we're all sobbing over what happened to our favourite characters but stop and think of the romantic aspect of it. (view spoiler) [Percy said he wouldn't lose her again! So they went together, tell me that's not romantic! (hide spoiler) ] Speculation: Octavian and his magical teddybears will return and Rachel will show him down. Reality: Octavian did return. And he did return with some murdered stuffed animals. On that point, I was right! On Rachel's return ... not so much. But how awesome would that have been - eh? But if you're an Octavian-hater, you're going to like what will happen in the first couple chapters of the book, primarily concerning a certain son of Jupitor and our favourite Seaweed Brain ganging up against him. A budding bromance between the two heroes? Perhaps. The character development is phenomenal, us readers truly understand how alike Jason and Percy really are, and at the same time, how different they are. Despite this though, Percy will always be my favourite. I don't care if Piper thinks Percy looks inferior to Jason, her delusional thinking really just adds to the fact that Percy is awesome. As you can tell, Jason seriously pissed me off in this book. But we'll get to that when the time comes. SPECULATION: Can we have some Tratie (Travis Stoll and Katie Gardner)? REALITY: Turns out as far as Riordan knows, Stoll and Gardner are not romantically linked. Pfft ... what does Rick really know ;) SPECULATION: Does Jason remember Reyna? Will he choose her over Piper? Personally, I'm rooting for Reyna and Jason. REALITY: I loathe HATE Jason Grace. How dare he toy both those girls! Sure, I don't have much respect for Piper but at the end of the day, I stick up for all girls. Call me a feminist (I take that as a compliment) but I cannot stand Jason toying with both Reyna's and Piper's feelings. He does remember Reyna, but does he even take the time to talk to her? NO! And speaking of Reyna, she easily is becoming one of my favourite characters. She is just so strong for New Rome and yet, we know she's hurting because she just wants someone to love her. I ached for and respected her at the same time. SPECULATION: Leo will find a girl (possibly Piper or Hazel) REALITY: Leo and Hazel! I think there is already a couple name for them! Personally, Leo is now one of my favourite characters. He is just so funny and that much needed comic relief! Team Leo! The only thing though is Frank is so sweet. Why does Rick have to have a love triangle? Overall You are never too old to read a book like this. Believe me, I admit it was awkward standing in a long line up of 10-year-olds all holding the same book as me, waiting to reach the till. But to be honest, I do not care. I actually think this is fanastic, that we can all read this book and experiecne the awesomeness despite our ages! Overall, this book had it all. It had the character development, it had the romance and the action, it totally nailed the suspense factor, and it had everything I could have asked for and more. Do you remember that just last year, we were all waiting and speculating and agonizing over what could and would happen next? We had the arguements and the fan-art and the lengthy discussions and it all led to this book, to the moment we read and finished Mark of Athena and could smile and say, we did it. Sure, we have to wait another year for the next one but still, we completed our goal! I say that's a sucess! My final thought? One more year till the next one. Until then, I'm going to be speculating and wondering and well, doing the same process as I did for this book. I don't know why you guys \"liked\" my insanity but I hoped you all liked the book and liked the review even though I can't find any redeeming qualities. Expect tons of changes to happen soon. This won't be the last you'll see (or read) of me! My Pre-review I'm just waiting Rick, so please hurry up because you know, I don't think my brain (and friends) can handle me obsessing about what will happen next! Seriously? SERIOUSLY? Suspense is great and all but only when you TELL US WHATS GONNA HAPPEN! Okay, that kinda defies the purpose of suspense but I can't just wait an entire year! What I hope will happen ~ Percy and Annabeth will reunite and share a kiss (or two, or three or heck, make them kiss every chapter) ~ Octavian and his magical teddy bears will return and Rachel will show him down ~ Is it too much to ask for a smidge of Tratie (Travis and Katie)? Sigh fine ~ I'm am interested DYING TO KNOW if Jason will remember Reyna. And if he'll choose her over Piper. Personally, I am rooting for Reyna cause she and him have an actual history together rather than 3 months of a fictional dating relationship cough cough Piper. ~ Speaking of Piper, can she go jump a cliff or something? Okay, I'll be nice. Pair her off with Leo. ~ In the case that Piper can't even win over Leo (take that charm speaker), than the love triangle between Frank/Hazel/Leo is pretty cool. I don't know where I stand on that one. I love Frank cause he and I are Canadians (not Laistryagns) but I dont have a thing on this. ~ MORE NICO!!!!!!! Is it wrong to have a crush on a slightly emo and witty fictional character? Oh whatever, in my mind he's hot ;) [image error] ~ And finally, I really liked the references from the previous books and I hope Riordan will continue to include them in his writings. So Rick, unless you want a whole load of crazy fan girls (like moi) on your doorstep with our lipsticks in hand, I suggest you get to wriitng ;) And post some spoilers please!!!!! Thats right, we're serious UPDATE! (May 26th, 2012) IT HAS A COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And guess who's on it .... ANNABETH!!!! Although she looks a little odd in the cover, I still can't stop fangirling that Annabeth will play a major role in this book! UPDATE! (June 1st, 2012) It has a new and even better cover ... Now onto the rant! Many of you may be confused with my last update about Annabeth being on the cover. Well, she was on the cover, before this new (and way better) cover came out today! Will this be the final cover? I don't know, but I do hope so! Ignoring the need to rant about the colour scheme and how absolutely beautiful it is, let's dig a bit deeper into this cover: 1) It has an owl on it. A very large owl that seems to be watching the fight. Could this be symbolizing Athena and she is actually present in the novel or is this just a symbol for Annabeth? Either way, I'm happy! Saying this, I also think that the owl in between the fight could either mean that it is stopping the fight, or the cause ... 2) It has Percy and Jason on it! Our 2 heroes are both on this cover .. and they're pissed off! It's not friendly combat, this looks like a full-on war. They're both using their powers (Percy with water, Jason with lightening). I wonder what could have made them fight, perhaps the two sides (Romans and Greeks) do not initially start off on the right foot. And , I'm not picking sides but Percy does know he's fighting Jason, son of Jupiter, in the sky. Jason has the upperhand, will Percy win? 3) I had to mention this because Percy is wearing an orange shirt! We all know what that means? HE'S WITH CAMP HALF-BlOOD! Whether the story takes place there or not, he is fighting on the side of his family! And Jason is wearing a purple shirt so he's back with Camp Jupiter. Could this mean that he left Piper (good riddance) and went for Reyna? I'm crossing my fingers! 4) Is that horse Percy's on Blackjack? Cool. With this new cover, I cannot wait for the book! If possible, my want for the book increased tenfold! Only around 5 more months guys, we can do it! Until I know some more news or I have something awesome to share with you, ta-ta! UPDATE! (August 25th, 2012) For those of you haven't heard yet, the first chapter is out! You can hear Rick Riordan read it aloud here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQxbCq... I have one thing to say (or more like 3 words): P.S WHY DID ANNABETH SAY JASON IS PIPER'S BOYFRIEND??? WHAT HAS RICK RIORDAN DONE?!?!?! UPDATE! (September 22nd, 2012) May I just say fellow fans that when I wrote this review, it was almost one year ago. And at that time, there were so many speculations. We didn't have a title, we didn't have a cover, we didn't have a snyposis!!! But did that stop us from speculating what the hell is gonna happen next? HELL NO! We speculated and we wondered and debated and got into some very funny serious arguments. But now, with only 10 days left, the answers are so close within our grasp. I can't wait! Let's analysise the snyposis we've been given and keep on speculating cause anything can happen until that book has been released : Annabeth is terrified ... With its steaming bronze dragon masthead, Leo\u2019s fantastical creation doesn\u2019t appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors from Camp Half-Blood are coming in peace. Okay, so from the first chapter that we have all hopefully read by now, we already now Annabeth fears the Romans will not be so friendly towards the Greeks. But what I cannot wrap my mind around is that Percy regained his memories, would he not tell Camp Jupiter to not fight against the Greeks? According to the cover art though, there will be a fight, but with Percy on the Greeks side where he belongs ! And that\u2019s only one of her worries. In her pocket Annabeth carries a gift from her mother that came with an unnerving demand: Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me. Annabeth already feels weighed down by the prophecy that will send seven demigods on a quest to find\u2014and close\u2014 the Doors of Death. What more does Athena want from her? OH MY GOSH! IT EXPLAINS THE TITLE! IT EXPLAINS THE TITLE! I can only wonder what the gift is. In the beginning I thought it was an owl and than I slapped myself for my stupidity because an owl cannot be carried in your pocket! What is the Mark of Athena? Avenge, for those of you who do not know (it's okay, I was one of those people), basically means that you take it upon yourself to get revenge in place of someone else. So someone wronged Athena and Annabeth must get revenge/justice for her. Doors of Death? What in heavens could be happening in this book? How come this snyposis is only leading me to ask more questions? Annabeth\u2019s biggest fear, though, is that Percy might have changed. What if he\u2019s now attached to Roman ways? Does he still need his old friends? As the daughter of the goddess of war and wisdom, Annabeth knows she was born to be a leader, but never again does she want to be without Seaweed Brain by her side. Haha, for a second I thought it would say her biggest fear is spiders No way, I refuse to have that fear. I refuse to believe that Percy could have changed. But I can understand Annabeth's fear, he has been missing for a long time and in that time, a person can change signfigantly. I have a feeling that Annabeth will like New Rome very much, as much as Percy does. But c'mon, this is Percy. He'll always be Seaweed Brain! He's gonna return to Camp Half-Blood! Just to add, does anyone else feel that the romance in this series is a bit too much? I mean, I LOVE romance, I'm one of those girls. But to be quite honest, there seems to be a bit too much love triangles/quads. Narrated by four different demigods, The Mark of Athena is an unforgettable journey across land and sea to Rome, where important discoveries, surprising sacrifices, and unspeakable horrors await. Climb aboard the Argo II, if you dare. . . . Narrated by four ... I already had this discussion with a GR member, Nick. Him and I both believe that obviously Annabeth will be one narrarator, Percy and Jason must be narrators and so that leaves one extra person. There are so many characters in this series, I don't have a clue who will be the fourth. A part of me actually wants Grover to be the 4th perspective. I miss the dynamic trio (Percy, Annabeth and Grover). Another part of me also wants Nico to be the fourth perspective and not just cause I want to marry the boy . And according to Rick: \"Nico has a key role in MoA but demigods are rarely safe!\" It would actually make complete sense for him to be the fourth perspective because he knew about the 2 camps and he is obviously a main character. Who do you think will be the fourth narrator? As long as it's not Piper, I'm good! In The Son of Neptune, Percy, Hazel, and Frank met in Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Halfblood, and traveled to the land beyond the gods to complete a dangerous quest. The third book in the Heroes of Olympus series will unite them with Jason, Piper, and Leo. But they number only six--who will complete the Prophecy of Seven? Many are saying Annabeth. And I agree to some degree, it would make perfectly logical sense that Annabeth completes the Prophecy, especially since she has such a main role. But when has Rick Riordan ever been predictable? I believe that it won't be Annabeth that completes the Prophecy but someone else, and Annabeth will tag along despite her not being one of the Seven and thus, she causes some deaths. another unforgettable adventure by master storyteller Rick Riordan. Another unforgettable adventure? I can already feel the cliffhanger ... So, after reading that, I am so pumped for Mark of Athena! I have re-read my entire Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series in preperation for this release date. Only 10 more days guys. Thats 240 hours. Feel the need to fangirl? So do I! Screw it. We're excited and we have the right to be! You ready? I think we're all ready! This will probably be my last update until the actual review after reading the book (unless I recieve some more information prior to). Until then, goodbye and remember, keep on speculating![\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN.

But okay, okay. Let's start at the very beginning. (A very good place to staaaart.) In his usual trollish fashion, Riordan left the previous book i OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN. I just ... I can't even ... I can't. Well ... Good job Rick Riordan. You have written another glorious book. Congrats. I salute you. But ... YOU ARE ALSO A HUGE TROLL, AND YOU ARE STOMPING ALL OVER MY FUCKING HEART, AND THAT ENDING WAS SO SAD AND BEAUTIFUL, AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT A YEAR FOR THE NEXT ONE. HOWWWWWW. ... But okay, okay. Let's start at the very beginning. (A very good place to staaaart.) In his usual trollish fashion, Riordan left the previous book in the series\u2013\u2013 The Son of Neptune \u2013\u2013just as Annabeth, Piper, Jason, and Leo were about to fly into Camp Jupiter (AND PERCY AND ANNABETH WERE ABOUT TO BE REUNITED AT LAAAST!). And then it was like ... THE END. And we all threw the book across the room, am I right? So, The Mark of Athena starts out exactly where the last book left off. Annabeth & co. are flying towards Camp Jupiter where Percy & co. are waiting for them. We finally, FINALLY get the Percabeth reunion we've all been waiting for. After two whole books and like 15 pages, Percy and Annabeth finally see each other again and they kiss and then Annabeth like judo-flips Percy and tells him never to leave her again and AWWWW I CAN'T HANDLE ALL MY FEELS. So yeah, after waiting like 1,000 pages it finally happened and it was totally worth the wait. It was perfect. But of course, since this is a Rick Riordan book, nothing stays perfect. And after not too long, there's a little mishap in which things explode, and well ... there's a bit of a misunderstanding. And let's just say, Percy, Annabeth, Leo, Piper, Jason, Frank, and Hazel all have to leave straightaway ... and also they might have accidentally turned Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter against each other. In typical Riordan style, there's a main plot in the book but it's also made up of a lot of little mini-adventures in which the characters have to go on a bunch of different quests and of course face a wide variety of crazy monsters and gods and all that jazz. And all of it is leading up to Annabeth taking one quest on her own and fulfilling a prophecy that has some rather ominous implications ... (Don't all prophecies?) This was a long book and it took me quite a while to read. However, I thought that\u2013\u2013as usual\u2013\u2013Riordan does a good job keeping the plot moving from one point to the next, and each little quest is almost like its own little story so there's no room for getting bored. Probably the most daunting task in this book was having to juggle all the characters. Now that the two groups from the previous books have joined together, that makes seven major characters to keep track of. Yikes. But Riordan handles this quite well. He does a good job paying equal attention to all the major characters and having them all interact with each other in one way or another. The huge group tends to branch off in pairs or groups of three or so as they go off on their various quests, so that makes it a bit easier to keep track of everyone. The only thing that gets a tad annoying about this is that sometimes you won't know what happens to certain characters for like 50 pages at a time. Like, one character will be about to fall off a cliff and it'll be like, \"TROLOLO time to go talk about another character for 100 pages!\" So, sometimes I would be impatiently waiting to hear about what was going on with a certain character and I wouldn't get to know forever and ever. But other than that, it wasn't too painful. Anyway ... as for the character development in this book, it was mostly awesome. I say \"mostly\" because some of the characters became a lot more likable than others. Towards the end, I wasn't that crazy about Jason or Piper. I didn't like Jason very much in The Lost Hero and I was expecting him to become a more compelling character but ... nah. I still feel like he's pretty boring in comparison to the others. He just doesn't have much of a personality, plus he's magically kickass and awesome and perfect at everything. So, he's just not all that interesting to me. Piper is slightly better, and I liked her for the most part in The Lost Hero , but in The Mark of Athena I kind of got impatient whenever the story was focused on her. Maybe it was just that I don't like her as much as most of the other characters. I don't hate her, but I don't love her either. I think she's kind of a damsel in distress and just ... meh. I'm not a huge fan. But other than those two, I found the character growth in The Mark of Athena to be excellent. First of all, it's great to see how much Percy and Annabeth have matured over the course of all the books. I almost got a little teary-eyed from nostalgia a few times. I kind of grew up with these books, in a way (throughout my teenage years anyway) ... That is, I was around 12 when the first book came out and they were 12 in the first book\u2013\u2013and every year when the next book came out, I would have aged another year just like they had. Well, and now they're stuck at 16 and I'm 20 but STILL. I've had these books in my life for quite a long time now, and it just means a lot to me to see them so grown up. I mean, Percy used to be so clueless and had no idea what he was doing 99% of the time. And now he's like wicked badass but he still stresses out about trying to save the world and crap and ugggh. And Annabeth used to be kind of mean and also got herself into trouble by having too much pride and yada yada ... and even though she's still super brave and kickass and all, she's more open and more humbled and EEEP it's just fantastic. And see, in a lot of books where two characters officially get together, the author tends to screw it up by a) making their relationship too damn perfect, or b) making everything go to heck and have something ridiculous happen like they break up again or whatever. But no, not our dear Rick Riordan! Yes, Percy and Annabeth do get a lot of time together in this book and it's really sweet. But, Riordan doesn't overkill it. For a lot of the book, Percy and Annabeth are off on separate quests doing what they need to do. As much as they care about each other, they both also realize that they have a duty to fulfill and that's what's most important. What I also love is that Annabeth doesn't depend on Percy to protect her or any crap like that. And also, Percy recognizes that Annabeth can take care of herself. Even when she has to go on her quest alone and could possibly die, Percy still lets her go\u2013\u2013not that he doesn't want to help her, but because he knows she needs to do it and that she's strong enough to succeed. I mean, can we all just stop and appreciate this for a second? DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE THIS IS IN YA BOOKS. DO YOU. Seriously, they're like the best fictional couple EVER. GAHHHH. In addition, Annabeth is just so awesome and courageous in this book. I felt like she finally got the spotlight she deserved after so many books, and Riordan really gives her a time to shine\u2013\u2013and she makes the most of it. I mean, dang ... she has to go on this crazy quest by herself, and face one of her worst fears (view spoiler) [ARACHNE, AAHHHH (hide spoiler) ] , and does this with a freakin' broken ankle. MY GOD. I was just reading this like \"ANNABETH MY POOR BABY UGH YOU'RE SO FLAWLESS YOU CAN DO IT I LOVE YOU.\" So, yeah. Seriously, Annabeth is one of my favorite female characters\u2013\u2013and one of my favorite characters, period\u2013\u2013in all the YA series I have ever read. Thank you, Rick Riordan, for giving us such a brave and relatable and believable YA heroine, because they are not so easy to come by. As for the other characters ... I have to acknowledge Leo especially, because I really felt for him in this book. It would be easy for him to just become the \"comic relief\" character and go totally ignored. But Leo is more than just \"the funny guy\" ... He's hilarious, yes, but his humor is used for the purpose of covering up his dark memories and his feelings that he's the odd one out. (Actually, he kind of reminds me of my beloved Sokka from \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" ... Man, can you imagine if they met each other and became best friends forever? UGGH THAT'D BE SO AWESOME. Anyway.) So, I felt that in this book he became a much more complex character. I liked him a lot in The Lost Hero but after reading The Mark of Athena I feel like I have a much better understanding of him and my love for him grew immensely. I also liked Frank and Hazel in this book, although I'm not sure if I liked them as much as I did in The Son of Neptune . Since the focus in this book tended to be more on Percy, Annabeth, Leo, Piper, and Jason, I felt like Frank and Hazel faded into the background a bit. We did at least get to learn more about Hazel's past which was great, and saw a new dynamic form between her and Leo because of it ... so I liked that. Frank was just kind of there being his usual awkward self, and I would have liked to see more of him, but I still liked him a lot. And about the Hazel/Leo thing ... Oh man, I'm so torn. On one hand, I love Frank and Hazel as a couple and I rooted for them throughout The Son of Neptune . But, well, I kind of like Leo and Hazel as a couple, too. Honestly, it's mostly because I feel so bad for Leo ... He feels so lonely a lot of the time and like no girl will ever like him and it's just ... GAHHH it's not fair. WHY WHY WHYYYYYY. So ... I really don't know. I'm super conflicted, and I guess I can only wait to see what the next book brings. Now, now, I'm finally coming to the end of my thoughts on this book and I just have one more major thing to address and that's THE FUCKING ENDING. HOLY MUSHROOMS. I don't think any amount of gifs can express how I felt about it, but I will try: MAJOR SPOILERZ: (view spoiler) [PERCY AND ANNABETH FELL INTO FUCKING TARTARUS?!?! NOOOO WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY OH GOD WHY. WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS THAT? STOP IT. STOP DOING THIS TO ME. Okay, but some sick part of me kind of loved this ending\u2013\u2013and that's because JESUS CHRIST IT WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL. JUST ... THIS: I'm dead. I can't. I don't ... AGHHH. Yes, it's horrible. But at least we know that they're still alive. Although ... they thought they were going to die and they decided to die together. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH. (hide spoiler) ] So yeah, let's just say the ending trumps all Riordan troll-endings. It's just heart-wrenching and terrifying and it's not nice to do that to your readers. ARRRGH. I need the next book. Oh, one more minor thing: I kind of have issues with the cover. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome cover. When I first saw it, I fangirl-ed all over the place. But\u2013\u2013especially after reading the book\u2013\u2013I have two major problems with it: a) WHY ISN'T ANNABETH ON THE FREAKING COVER? I mean really ... The book is called The Mark of Athena , and seeing as Annabeth is the daughter of Athena and that she has to go through more crap than anyone in this book, I think she deserves to be on the front of the book. Am I right? I mean, the only sign of Annabeth is the owl eyes in the background, and well ... that's not really enough, if you ask me. I'm guessing the publisher didn't want a girl on the cover because they thought it might prevent a good chunk of tweenage boys from buying the book. And maybe that's true, but would it have hurt to put Annabeth on the cover somewhere ? There could have still been boys on the cover, but Annabeth should have been there in some way. Not fair if you ask me. b) It's also super misleading. As you can see in my pre-review ranting below, I was rather shocked to see Jason and Percy fighting against each other on the cover. I was like, \"Wait, what? I thought the idea of this book was that they were going to join forces! WTF?!\" But ... (view spoiler) [The scene depicted on the cover is a very short scene in which, yes, Percy and Jason briefly try to kill each other. But well, it's because they're hypnotized so it doesn't really count. (hide spoiler) ] So, yeah. I'm not sure why this was chosen to be the cover of the book. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me. All right, so I think that's about where my rant ends. I'm probably about to run out of space for this review anyway. Point is ... I loved this book. It was exciting and awesome, and for the most part had a lot of terrific character development. The ending was pure evil and I can't wait for The House of Hades . HOORAY! Pre-review rants under the spoiler, if you care about them: (view spoiler) [ Me fangirling before the book even comes out: This book needs to come out right now. RIGHT NOW. I finished reading The Son of Neptune yesterday, so ... I am dying here. Dang you Rick Riordan for ending all of your books with a cliffhanger. Why would you do that to me? WHYYYYYY? Anyway, the point is, I am very excited for this book. I was somewhat depressed by the lack of Annabeth in The Son of Neptune, and it's obvious she'll play a big role in the third book so ... AAHHHHHH. Plus she and Percy have not even seen each other for two whole books and that SUCKS. I can't believe I have to wait a year for this. I think I will explode. *BOOM* UPDATE! (5/2/12) Alrighty, so Rick Riordan has officially released the first chapter. You can read it here (and/or listen to him reading it): http://cedarleaf-7.livejournal.com/79... So, yeah. ;ALDKJF;LSJFLSJD. Okay, I'm very sleep-deprived right now so I'm not going to say much. Just that\u2013\u2013as I was hoping\u2013\u2013Annabeth seems to be the main character in this one. SERIOUSLY GUYS, I CAN'T CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT. ANNABETH IS MY FAVORITE. SQUEEEEE. Also, it's cool to see the characters from The Lost Hero back again. Well, that is, it's cool to see Leo and Piper again. I don't like Jason that much, for the same reason Annabeth seems to dislike him ... he's just too perfect. But, oh well. And ARGH DAMMIT, I was really hoping that the much-anticipated Percabeth reunion would come at the end of this excerpt. But alas! It did not. Rick Riordan, how you torture me. Gahhh, I'm just so excited to see all these characters meet each other and kick ass together and whatnot. AND I JUST WANT TO SEE PERCY AND ANNABETH TOGETHER AGAIN, OKAY? So, yeah. Goodbye for now ... until this book actually comes out. Or until I hear some other kind of fantastic news about it. UPDATE! (6/5/12) OH GOSH. THERE IS A COVER. AND THERE IS A RELEASE DATE. IT COMES OUT THE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY, HELL YEAH! AND GOSH, THAT COVER. IT IS SO PRETTY. THE OWL EYES. AHH. BUT OH MY GOODNESS, WHAT IS HAPPENING?! IS THAT JASON AND PERCY FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER? WHAAAAT? MY MIND CANNOT COMPREHEND THIS. I NEED THIS BOOK NOW PLEASE THANK YOU. CAN'T HANDLE ALL MY EXCITEMENT.

And all I'm going to say is that I'm getting bad vibes from Athena. Oh, and come on! The first chapter ends in a cliff hanger. Nothing new there. Well, now I just gotta wait till October the 2nd..... Guess there's nothing we can do about that *SPOILERS IF YOU CARE* Oh gods oh gods, WHY ALL THE CRUELTY!!!!!????? Rick, please spare me, spare us all the agony of waiting a WHOLE $&@$&& YEAR! I just finished The Lost Hero and oh boy, what a cliff hanger! And all this talk about 'daughter of wisdom walks alone, the mark of Athena burns through Rome'. My insides are so heated up I might melt if I have to wait a whole year! Then there's also Hera telling Percy his weakness is loyalty, and how he's going to have to make some painful sacrifices, and then she tells him the person closest to him will be causing him trouble (Annabeth??) Three wishes for Mr. Rick 1. Don't make Percy have to kill Annabeth!!!! 2. Make Annabeth a lead character (please?) 3. ANNABETH AND PERCY BETTER NOT BREAK UP!!!!

Why did it take me so long to continue this series? Why did I let Rick Riordan down? It was just great to return to the world of the Greek and Roman gods and monsters. Entertaining and so incredibly hilarious! Oh man, I loved this so much. The Mark of Athena has a few tiny flaws, but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing read. WHY, RICK RIORDAN?! Why would you do that to us?! I just waited a year for Son of Neptune and now you are making me wait AGAIN for Mark of Athena! All I can say now is: WHAT THE HECK?! COME FASTER, 2012! edit 10/23/11: What the... well, only good thing is that it's September this time, instead of October. Oh well. See ya in a year! Those were my two reactions when my sister told me the book was about to come out. I can't wait for this book!!!!! (you probably already figured that out by the pictures. he he.) The cover on the book seems so... dramatic. It looks like Percy and Jason are about to fight. Guess I'll just have to wait. Wow, the more I think about it, it is really hard to wait. (sigh) After awhile One day guys only one day!!! After finishing the book woohoo! I finally finished the book! :) Oh wait...the next book comes Those were my two reactions when my sister told me the book was about to come out. I can't wait for this book!!!!!

(back to the Mark of Athena) one of my favorite lines was when Percy said to Annabeth, \"We're staying together,\" Percy promised. \"You're not getting away from me. Never again.\" Only then did she understand what would happen. A one-way trip. A very hard fall. \"As long as we're together,\" she said Those lines almost made me cry. (Ok, I kind've did cry...) I also loved these lines, \"What are you talking about?\" Narcissus demanded. \"I am amazing. Everyone knows this.\" \"Amazing at pure suck,\" Leo said. \"If I was as suck as you, I'd drown myself. Oh wait, you already did that.\" Those lines made me chuckle. I mean who says that? ...more FINALLY FINISHED October 5th: *Dramatic sobbing from girl writing this review* WHY RICK?!!! WHY?!!!

Those two in the penultimate chapter, yeah them. That was a fate worse FINALLY FINISHED October 5th: *Dramatic sobbing from girl writing this review* WHY RICK?!!! WHY?!!!

Do you revel in our pain and anguish from chapters such as THAT PENULTIMATE CHAPTER!!! YOU KNOW THE ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT!!! How could you do this to us?!?!? And to the characters?!?!? Those two in the penultimate chapter, yeah them. That was a fate worse than Harry Potter's! (And I'm referring to the fact he had to marry Ginny) *cough* Alright. I think I'm finished with the shouting. At least till the end of this review. This book truly was fantastic. I don't have a single solitary complaint about it besides the tear-jerking penultimate chapter. The Mark of Athena picks right were the Son of Neptune left off, though everyone who read the first chapter sneak peek knows that already. BTW, that sneak peek wasn't the whole chapter. WE WERE CHEATED! Fans of Percabeth will be 100% satisfied with this book. Plenty of perfect Percabeth moments are scattered throughout pleasing us rabid fans, yet they don't overwhelm the book, annoying those of you who don't like as much romance. There are also Piper/Jason moments, but I personally want them to get into an argument. I want some conflict in that relationship. Percabeth has enough, and is only going to get more in the next book *writer of review glares at smiling Rick on the inside jacked of The Mark of Athena.* However, I'm hopeful the next book will give me the conflict in Jason/Piper's perfect relationship since sons of Jupiter get a lot of heat throughout history and in this book. I suppose that I do have one big complaint I have is that the book was really slow at the beginning. Oh sure, there was plenty to read and tons of action. But we didn't get to the main portion of the quest until about 350 pages in. There was a lot of build-up to the quest. Every part was important and fun to read, some more so than others, but never the less, it was just build up. All the really awesome stuff (or torturous stuff, depending on your point of view) didn't happen till they reached Rome. So, I really don't have anything else to say, besides the statement that I AM SICK OF WAITING!!!!! And guess what, fans of this series, we have TWO MORE YEARS OF WAITING!!!! One for The House of Hades, and one for the fifth book. Yep. So my advice to those of you who haven't read the book yet, wait to read this one as long as you possibly can. You think waiting for the Percabeth reunion was bad. Just you wait until you read this one. This next year is going to be like listening to opera music in Tartarus. One last thing, before I leave you: TEAM LEO!!!!!!!!!!! (Though I'm still a supporter of Frazel.) Edit September 25: I'm starting to become a little paranoid. What if Annabeth isn't the seventh halfblood? I really don't believe she and Rome are going to get along. \"The Mark of Athena burns through Rome.\" Shudders... These next seven days until the release are going to be torture. And not just because I have a bunch of insane college work I'm going to do just so I won't have any to do on the day this book comes out. Cause you better believe I will not put that book down until I read all 608 pages on Tuesday. *Scowls at calender* Rick. I'm talking to you. If you break up Percy and Annabeth, or even hint that you might... I will end you. Edit June 4th: I KNEW IT!!!!!! Annabeth rules!!! Look at that pretty cover. Me want now!!!!! I wonder who the four demigods who get to tell the story are going to be. Annabeth, for sure. My guess is Percy, Jason, and maybe Leo, just because he'll be navigating the ship. Plus he's going to be the comic relief of the series. OCT 4th, 2011: \"The Mark of Athena\" AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY (view spoiler) [ANNABETH!!!! (hide spoiler) ] Kay, so that's the title of the third book. I'm so about to go into diva-book-worm mood about my speculations to it and I'll talk spoilers to \"The Son of Neptune\", so do not read this if you have not read it. You have been warned. You gone yet? Oh my Olympians, I can not wait for this book! It looks like Annabeth will be the seventh half-blood. I wasn't sure it was going to be her at first, since I thought Hazel would be a daughter of Minerva, but since she is luckily a daughter of Pluto, Annabeth has to be the seventh. Plus it really wouldn't be right to introduce a totally new major character in the third book. It also means that Annabeth has some kind of superpower! I wonder what that could be? Whatever it was, I think that kid had it that Deadulas killed. Athena said she had blessed him. Percy and Annabeth better not break up. From what was said, I think they are going to get into a lot of arguements. \"Wisdom's daughter walks alone, the Mark of Athena burns though Rome.\" Uh-oh... On to other people... Frank/Hazel/Leo. I'm so sick of love triangles. I won't put what I hope doesn't happen that I'm thinking, so I won't make some of you sad. I just don't want Hazel/Leo. Frazel is cute. Leo deserves someone else... *cough ME cough* Oh, and will get to see Jason and Piper again. Yippie :/ Maybe now though Piper won't be *as* obsessed with Jason. She's not so bad otherwise. Anyway, that's all I have to say for now. That is, until the cover hopefully including Annabeth comes out!

Name a mer-hero, and we have trained him or her!\u201d \u201cOh, sure,\u201d Leo said. \u201cLike\u2026um, the Little Mermaid?\u201d Moving on to Mr. Sneaky Jackson *giggles*, he had his fair share of humorous moments. And I absolutely loved the trick that he pulled on the golden boy/warrior/whatsover. \u201cBehold!\u201d Percy shouted. \u201cThe god\u2019s chosen beverage. Tremble before the horror of Diet Coke!\u201d Despite the humor and snarky comments, I noticed that this book can't seem to hold my attention for more than I have wanted it to. My attention span isn't that great to begin with but come on it's Rick Riordan! Sigh. Maybe I just wasn't into it like I was with his other books. Or... it could be because of the lack of chemistry between the seven demigods. They seem too focused on their inner struggles and find it very hard to open up until the last minute possible. I hope their relationship improves in the next book. Overall, this was an awesome and fun read. I can't wait to read the last two books of the series! ...more -_- Chapter fifty-one, second half. Be warned. In The Mark of Athena, Percy, Hazel and Frank meet up with four others from Camp Half-Blood: Jason, Piper, Leo, and Annabeth. This book's main conflict is pretty simple: Go to Rome, stay alive. Their goal is to make it to Rome, find Hazel's brother Nico, and find the Doors of Death. This book takes place all over, but the main setting is on Leo's warship: The ArgoII . They visit Kansas, Atlanta, and some more places. ;) I loved, LOVED, that Annabeth's -_- Chapter fifty-one, second half. Be warned.

Annabeth is such a kick-butt girl, it's fun to see her point of view on things. Percy, of course, narrated some chapters too. The two of them together again was hilarious! :D The book was funny, had lots of action, problem solving, and Diet Pepsi(Don't ask). I was laughing my head off at some things Coach Hedge did: One of which he's on the boat yelling, ' Bring it on lake! YEAH! ' I thought that was hilarious. The ending. -_- Oh. My. Freaking. Gosh. The ENDING. Rick did his first real cliffhanger. (view spoiler) [They fell into Tartarus and Leo said he was going to blow Gaea up with bigger weapons! Hello?!?! CLIFFHANGERS! (hide spoiler) ] I admit though, I enjoy when something happens to the main characters because otherwise it seems like you're favoring them too much. I'm glad Rick writes suck great books but.....PLEASE! Faster! Or at least a chapter sneak peek? Please? Well, anyways, I recommend to Rick Riordan fans, people who love mythology, and action lovers. If you've read The Lost Hero, The Son of Neptune, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians series..You are bound to love this book. ...more 10/11/12 Just finished it.

HOW ABOUT LIKE THIS?? ARE WE STARTING TO PAINT A PICTURE HERE OF THE INCREDIBLE PAIN I'M IN RIGHT NOW? LIKE. NO. AND WHAT. AND PLEASE STAHP, RICK RIORDAN, YOU MALICIOUS LEAF. **hyperventilates** Okay, but really. Let's talk about this book. This is my 8th Riordan read, and it is excellent . Probably the best so far. I was woefully bored in book 2: The Son of Neptune but completely in love with book 1: The Lost Hero . And The Mark of Athena?! YEAH, I KINDA LOVED IT. The only reason it's not getting full marks is I often felt the story dragged about. There were so many side quests, it just got from cool and interesting to tedious. Like the Heracles detour? Yeah, no. That did nothing for the story. Oh it's all creative. The entire series is masterfully creative and ingenious. Like how does the author see this tiny myth thread and then weave it into modern times AND his huge plot so perfectly?! He's like a Greek mythological writerly spider. It's insanely cool. I always feel like I've learnt a lot about Greek (and Roman now!) myths when I read these books. But duuuudes. I'm there for the characters. SO LET'S TALK CHARACTERS. + Percy: He's my favourite. He just has to be, because he's totally endearing and adorable and scruffy and tries so hard, and says the dumbest things, and gets angry and is so just incredible . He's not perfect. He riles up gods and gets their whole group in trouble and he blasts things with water when he shouldn't. BUT HE'S SO DARN WONDERFUL. And #Percabeth. Um, yes. So much shipping. I'm literally dying with the shipping right now. + Annabeth: JAFDKL SHE IS SO EPIC. One of the biggest things I love about Annabeth is that she gets into problems and gets herself out of them. She isn't a damsel in distress...like ever . She's really smart too which is so so awesome. OH and she really keeps the group together and focused. ANNABETH, YOU DARLING. + Jason: I'm not Jason's biggest supporter because I feel like he's been cast as the golden boy. Which, duh, he has. He actually doesn't get any POV time in this book though. And I adored his developing friendship with Percy. Bromance, um, heck yeah dude. + Piper: I like Piper! OKAY I LOVE THEM ALL. But Piper is smart and level-headed...although probably not my favourite of the girls. She felt very needy about Jason in this book...like she needed constant reassurance that Renya wasn't between them. BUT HEY. She's like 16 and doing these death defying quests so if she wants to be a bit needy? I LET HER. + Hazel: She's so the baby of the group at 13, which is why I get twitchy with her amount of romance. Like, dude, she's THIRTEEN. She's a baby!! But even at one stage Annabeth wonders if Percy likes Hazel. *facepalm* Stop, guys. Anyway , at least her relationship with Frank is just cautious couple stage, and it's altogether adorable. Though for being the daughter of Hades, Hazel isn't very deathy. + Frank: Again, he too didn't get any POV time, which is okay by me. I like Frank but I don't love him. He's very prickly. Like very , particularly when he thinks his tentative status with Hazel is being threatend by Leo. DUDE. You can turn into a frikkin dragon. BE CONFIDENT. But I kind of do like how Frank's relatable in his feeling of being overlooked, while everyone is, in reality, in absolute awe of him. He's a relatable darling. + Nico: SOMEONE GIVE NICO AN ACTUAL PLOT LINE AND STUFF BECAUSE I LOVE HIM AND HE GETS LEFT OUT. Leo: ZOMGGGG LEO MY DARLING BABY. Okay, he is my favourite. I mean, Percy is the top, but Leo is just little and spunky and has the attention of a gnat and is so so clever. He always feels like the seventh wheel (thanks for that image Nemesis) and he doesn't have a \"coupling\", but ermagerd he is so CUTE. And, like, how genius?! He runs this whole ship nearly by himself. He's got buttons for everything. And he controls it with a Wii remote. Tell me that's not freakishly fantastic. I LOVE LEO. #TEAMLEO Ahem. As you can see, I think Rick Riordan writes insanely dynamic characters that are all different and dimensional and winning. I'm totally invested in all their lives. Well, what's left of their lives. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL GONNA DIE AREN'T THEY?? Life sucks. The plot pretty much followed the Riordan-Formula. They get a prophecy, they go on a big quest with a bunch of mini quests in between. They met loads of gods. They get confused because people have secrets. They meet one or more of their parents who is probably nuts. They get screwed over by gods. And they make sort-of-friends with other gods. They nearly die like A BILLION TIMES. There are ghosts and dryads and fauns and Romans. There's a heck of a lot of pizza. But it's all written in this quirky and engaging way that I couldn't even look off the page. Everything is amusing. EVERYTHING is epic. I do wish the book had been smaller because, like I said, I think it detoured too much and I got bored in a lot of the middle ground...but these characters are so my favourites and I could probably read about them forever. BUT THAT ENDING WAS SUPER NASTY. Cliffhanger? UM. YEAH. IT KINDA IS A REALLY BAD ONE. (view spoiler) [ I will forever diiiiiie of happiness that Percy chose to stay with Annabeth. DON'T YOU LET HER GO. Omg. My heart is bleeding. :') Sure they fell into the depths of hell together, but at least it's TOGETHER. I'm quite calm about the whole thing, truly. (hide spoiler) ] I have a new favourite book, I have a heart ripped in two, I have a bookhangover. Life is great, heck yeah. I'd wave flags of awesome but, you know, I'm too busy freaking out. ***QUOTES I LOVED**** [Jason] \"Lord Bacchus, do you remember me? I helped you with that missing leopard in Sonoma.\" Bacchus scratched his stubbly chin. \"Ah...yes. John Green.\" \"Jason Grace.\" \"Whatever,\" the god said. UM. IS THAT A REFERENCE?!!! Apparently you are the greatest, John Green, because I'm 10000% convinced this was an intentional reference. \"So it wasn't my fault.\" Leo exhaled. \"I didn't start World War Three. I just got possessed by an evil spirit. That's a relief.\" \u201cThis is Annabeth,\u201d Jason said. \u201cUh, normally she doesn't judo-flip people.\u201d \u201cBeing a hero doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re invincible. It just means that you\u2019re brave enough to stand up and do what\u2019s needed.\u201d Percy looked at his friends. \"I'm getting tired of this guy's shirt.\" \"Combat time?\" Piper grabbed her horn of plenty. \"I hate Wonder bread,\" Jason said. Together, they charged. ...don't think I didn't see that I'm getting tired of this guy's shirt ... HA.

The book starts off with Annabeth's perspective. She's feeling a cold presence on the ship as the Greeks sail into the Roman camp in order to reunite with Percy. Unfortunately, since these characters will never catch a break, \u201cWisdom\u2019s daughter walks alone The Mark of Athena burns through Rome Twins snuff out the angel\u2019s breath Who holds the key to endless death Giants\u2019 bane stands gold and pale Won through pain from a woven jail\" The Mark of Athena is the third book in the Heroes of Olympus series. The book starts off with Annabeth's perspective. She's feeling a cold presence on the ship as the Greeks sail into the Roman camp in order to reunite with Percy. Unfortunately, since these characters will never catch a break, something goes wrong and a civil war begins between the two camps. Completely by accident which I found a tad ironic. When you come in peace to get a friend and get possessed which results in you firing at the peaceful city. This results in our crew (Piper, Jason, Annabeth, Percy, Leo, Hazel, Frank and our notorious guardian Coach Hedge) having to flee and spend quite a bit of the book cautious of what they're doing and constantly having near misses with the Roman army after them. However, when they cross the ocean the Roman army doesn't follow but they experience a bunch of other problems ( of course ) which results in delays of their quest. Before I get into my opinions on the point of views of the characters can I just say how much I love Coach Hedge. He bloody always wants to blow something up and I'm constantly laughing at his reactions to everything. (view spoiler) [Percy and Annabeth fall into Tartarus? Should have blown more things up! (hide spoiler) ] . Just completely hilarious in my opinion. Moving on, the points of view we witness in this book are: Annabeth our daughter of Athena. If anyone knows me they know that Annabeth is my favourite character in the series. I absolutely loved her chapters in the book. Being able to read from the perspective of one of my favourite characters who didn't get the chance in the original series was incredible. I loved the fact that her and Percy reunited, and that after kissing him her instant reaction was to judo-flip him. Can you say badass? Yes you can. Or I will. Don't care what your opinion is in this moment, this is my thoughts and opinions. Annabeth has her own personal quest in this book. Gets her moment in the life as she's the character who is destined to reunite the camps of Greek and Roman's. She must follow the mark of Athena in order to achieve this. I loved the fact Annabeth quickly worked out what she was meant to do because it would have taken any other character a book and a half to work it out. Leo our great son of Hephaestus who also has the ability to control fire has completed his ship and accidentally started a civil war. I live Leo. He's great. Though he seemed a tad whiny in this book due to the fact he will never truly be at home among the seven or whatever Nemesis said. I didn't feel like his parts of the novel were quite useful but I still enjoyed reading from his perspective and the humour he provided. Piper our daughter of Aphrodite who continues to think she's above all and think of no one but herself except math her strange and unhealthy obsession with her boyfriend. God, I can honestly admit to my hate solidifying for Piper during this book. I couldn't stand her chapters. I was constantly rolling my eyes at how Rick had tried to make her different and not care about beauty. Yet, she talks about how in now way is Percy her type because he had a \"bad boy\" look about him. Honey, that's judging someone by their appearance which you are so adamant about disgusting your own. Ugh, she made me want to scream and tear my hair out simultaneously. I really wish I could have skipped her chapters. In real life I doubt Jason and Piper would date longer than a year, especially considering how manipulative she tries to be and her unhealthy hatred for anything Jason likes that isn't her. To continue my Piper rant that shows how stupid, idiotic and selfish she is, here's a quote: \u201cPiper wondered if he\u2019d made a wish\u2014hopefully that he and Piper would survive this quest and stay together forever.\" Percy the son of Poseidon who is slightly afraid of drowning since his trip to Alaska in the previous book. I honestly didn't notice when the book switched from Piper to Percy. I'm so used to Percy that the perspective just felt natural as we dived straight into one of his vision dreams. Percy is obviously one of my favourite characters. How couldn't he be? Reading his chapters made me so happy since I know the point of view of a favourite character isn't common in these books (especially Blood of Olympus ). I loved this book. I adored the point of views (excluding Piper). I adored everything that happened. I loved that we got Percy back with the gang. I loved Leo. I loved Frank. I loved Hazel. I just have a lot of love. The only negative for me would be Piper and Jason. I'm sorry if you love jiper and you love those characters, but for me I found them ridiculous and Piper's inner monologue was immature and obsessive (refer to several rants on Piper for more information). The ending of this book always gets me too. My heart always completely breaks and it makes me desperately want the next book (which thankfully I have). Also makes me glad that even the first time I read this book the whole series was already out. 10/10 completely loved. ...more 4.5, really. I don't know why, but I liked \"The Son of Neptune\" better (just a little bit). Anyways, this book was AWESOME. Percy and Annabeth have my heart <3. Oh my god, this book was awesome!! My favourite of the series so far!! I love Leo and loved Percy and Annabeth in this book so much!! That ending was crazyyy, so going to read House of Hades asap!! Looooved!! Rick Riordan has come a long way with this series. And I mean it both literally and metaphorically. Literally because duh, it's the eighth book about these characters - if that isn't long enough for you, then I don't know what is. Metaphorically because if you contrast this with the original series, you can see how much mature it has become: The first books were fun and all, but this... this is the real stuff. But let's get on with the characters first. Now the seven demigods from the Great Prophe Rick Riordan has come a long way with this series. And I mean it both literally and metaphorically.

Metaphorically because if you contrast this with the original series, you can see how much mature it has become: The first books were fun and all, but this... this is the real stuff. But let's get on with the characters first. Now the seven demigods from the Great Prophecy are finally together. They're trios we met in The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune plus Annabeth. After a totally heartwarming reunion (I mean it, my feels did crazy things while it lasted) and a successful sabotage attempt from Gaea's minions, the peace between Greeks and Romans seems even less possible, so our characters have to leave in a rush to a quest that will literally take them across the sea and will make their nightmares seem like a cute thing. The only characters in here that can be compared to how they were in the original series are Percy and Annabeth. I. Freaking. Loved them. I remember how clumsy Percy was in the first book, getting himself in trouble all the time, etc. Now he's all grown up. He was 12 at first, and now he's almost 17 so the contrast is pretty obvious. And not to mention he now has a romance with Annabeth, which I totally shipped, by the way. And Annabeth... God(s), if she were real, I'd stalk the hell out of her and force her to marry me. Okay, not so creepy, but you get the idea: She was amazing. Not only is she intelligent, but she's also really brave and self-sufficient. She angsted over Percy at times, but that didn't consume her. In fact, it made her stronger because it gave her more reasons for not failing in the quest she had at hands. Because it's true: She now has a task that only she alone can conquer. The rest of the crew are the \"new\" characters: Leo, Piper, Hazel, Jason and Frank as the other 5 demigods and Coach Hedge as an additional help. Out of the chosen ones, Ican only say I truly liked Leo. At moments he annoyed me because his jokes felt a little like this guy's jokes: If you've watched Star Wars, Episode I , then you know how annoying and useless that guy was, and how he downgraded the quality of the movie by making cheap jokes. Of course, Leo is necessary to the quest, but sometimes that's how his jokes (and Hedge's ones too) felt. Not all of the jokes were like that, though. There were some that were genuinely funny without overdoing it. For example, the Narcissus scene. I don't think I've ever read something so funny. I kept laughing till tears almost shone through my eyes. and we can't leave out the scene when they find Percy and Annabeth asleep in the stables and Coach Hedge totally lost it because he thought they were doing something else, if you know what I mean. Scenes like those cracked me up. Piper and Jason are still not better. They're both too perfect - even their romance, which I totally don't ship. Speaking of which... My gods, the romance in this book. I can say that if I talk about Percy + Annabeth, it's an improvement, but Jason + Piper? LAME. And how about Frank + Hazel? WORSE. If I could dissolve one of these two romances, I'd go for the latter one. Thankfully, there weren't any Frank/Hazel moments, although there were hints of the love triangle I was predicting, but again, it wasn't overdone. And can we talk about everything that went on in this book? Jeez, my heart barely had a moment of relief when I turned the page and another thing unleashed. The action never ended, and with each problem faced, things only got worse and worse. By the end I just wanted everyone to have a HEA, but no, instead we get the biggest cliffhanger in existence that got me awfully angry at Rick Riordan. The cliffhanger at the ending wasn't the only one in the book, though. Because, yes, even inside the book they were present. And they infuriated me. During the last 150 pages of the book, my face was a combination of this: ... and this: It was so damn intense and page-turning! And that's a lot to say for an almost-600-pages book. Not to mention during all those pages, I was confused. I think I'm finally getting a grip of the gods' double personalities, but trust me I felt my brain was going to explode with trying to decipher why the hell the gods were now changing into their Roman side given that they had been Greek until now. Still, Riordan did a fantastic job at incorporating all this mythology and legends without getting to info-dump. They fit perfectly into the story and made the experience all the more better. I honestly don't know what else to praise to this book. At this moment, my pride and me are having a fight. Deep inside, I feel the book deserves a full 5 stars, but my pride is also murmuring its faults in my ear. For now, I'm leaving it the rating it has. If it changes, then you know why that was. In any case, I'm gonna leave this review here because I'm wasting my precious time. I should have started book 4 hours ago, but I just couldn't leave this without a review. Now that I'm done, I'm off to read book 4! DO NOT BOTHER ME TILL I'M DONE WITH IT. P.S.: I really don't like the cover. ...more 2.5. How are all these kids still alive?

Granted, it's probably earned him a couple million bucks, but it really dragged me down. The beginning and the ending were really good, but the middle 300 pages were just... ugh, it's always \"crew meets obstacle, crew beats obstacle, crew fi I'm going to be taking a break from this series for a little while.

The beginning and the ending were really good, but the middle 300 pages were just... ugh, it's always \"crew meets obstacle, crew beats obstacle, crew finds clue to next obstacle\". Repeat 30 times until you have a 600-page book. I'm also not feeling the stakes in this series. Logically, you know no one's going to die because otherwise the quest would be forfeit and there would not be five books. So I'm just not feeling any tension because I don't believe anything will happen until the final book. Also, none of the popular ones can ever die because they need to be used as fanbait in other series. \"OH LOOK PERCY MAKES ANOTHER CAMEO.\" Sorry, I really needed to complain for a second. I really do hope the story picks up from here now that we're reaching the finale -- the ending definitely made it sound interesting. But like I said, I won't be reading it for a while. Hopefully, a break will restore the enjoyment I used to feel when reading PJO. ...more After Reading: Frankly, this was sub-par and not at all worthy of Rick Riordan and the characters he's created (By that I mean Percy and Annabeth, not the new people. The others' creation was sub-par to begin with). What we have here is some very shoddy work. Too many cooks spoil the broth and the many narrators made for a choppy and boring story. The characters were very flat. Mr. Riordan has managed to create a singularly annoying character in Coach Hedge. Piper and Leo are not far behind.

The characters were very flat. Mr. Riordan has managed to create a singularly annoying character in Coach Hedge. Piper and Leo are not far behind. Jason the cardboard cutout is just hanging there. Even Percy and Annabeth have become unidimensional characters filled with lots of angst and unnecessary emo. Flat, uninspired, slipshod, bad. I could go on and on with more synonyms but you catch my drift. So unworthy of Mr. Riordan's legacy. It's hardly believable that he wrote this. I am very sad to say this book is not worth the time, money, or effort it takes to acquire and read it. Here's a fervent hope that book 4 would be better, because the bar for this series has just been set at a new low. -------------------------------- Our dudes are supposed to be a team, but from the absolutely stunning cover, it seems Percy and Jason are fighting. Bites fingernails. But oh well, in that case.... Crush him to bits, Percy!!! ...more My thoughts about: Percy and Annabeth Both. I love both. Frank, Hazel and Leo The plot No more comments. There would be too many spoilers otherwise... Too much happened. Too many surprises and thrilling things and unexpected and expected changes... And finally...the ending...

I literally couldn't put this book down. I did not even sleep... I need the next book. NOW! ...more GODS remember how i said last book was the best so far?? OK THIS ONE IS THE BEST SO FAR!!! oh my god that was amazing! that was amazing! that was amazing! from the beginning, to that heart!stopping!ending! incredible. it just worked so well. ok i admit i did skip some pages on pipers POV but the forced-het-romance between her and jason is so annoying, i'm sorry! ANYWAYS WHO'S READY TO START THE HOUSE OF HADES AT 2:40am?? this girl *EDIT Okay, that has got to be the BEST CLIFFHANGER HE HAS EVER WROTE (and yeah i meant it as a pun) if youve read the ending you'll know why . . i have NO IDEA how im going to be able to wait a whole year for this book to come out . . . so until then, here are my predictions 1. Percybeth reunites. No doubt about it. 2. Probably going to make a stop at CHB because it was mentioned earlier that the giants (or their warriors whatever) were attacking BOTH camps. but it seems unlikely since they sailed *EDIT Okay, that has got to be the BEST CLIFFHANGER HE HAS EVER WROTE (and yeah i meant it as a pun) if youve read the ending you'll know why . . i have NO IDEA how im going to be able to wait a whole year for this book to come out . . . so until then, here are my predictions 1.

Piper and Jason stay together. Nothing really happened between Reyna and Jason, they were just praetors together, not much romance there . . . AS FOR HERA WARNING PERCY THAT HE IS TOO LOYAL TO HIS FRIENDS . . . i have a feeling that at some point in this series, Percy has to make a decision to sacrifice someone, chooses not to, and Frank whips out his piece of wood and basically dies . . . hence THROUGH STORM OR FIRE THE WORLD MUST FALL. oh, and leo lights the wood himself. as for: the mark of athena burns through rome, wisdom's daughter walks alone. . . maybe annabeth gets lost? and they have to rescue her . . ? i dont know. at this point, im just spewing out ideas. let me know if you think theyre interesting. ...more", "Title": "The Mark of Athena"},
