More than any woman he'd ever met, she commanded his respect. (p.136) 5. Hair was so very personal. A woman wears it, sleeps with it. It carries fragrance and color and texture. A woman's very essence. No wonder Catherine had been horrified to learn that a man she did not know possessed such an intimate part of her. (p.195) 6. \"He only assaults women who act like victims.\" (p.247) 1. So a womb is the thing that makes a woman! Glad we solved that. 2. This is Rizzoli thinking and the \"disgusting object\" is actually a tampon. I'm assuming it's unused because how would a bunch of men get a used tampon, let alone shove it into a bottle of mineral water, but how could a clean tampon be considered disgusting unless you hate women and/or female bodies? 3. Fucking! A word with excellent shock value! HOWEVER, fucking is sex. Rape is not sex. Sorry, but you're only perpetuating the misconception that rape is just a kind of unhappy sex. Also nice is how this character (angry,<---M> possibly man-hating</---M>, woman) is saying that all women blame themselves for being raped. 4. Oh no, it's not condescending at all to be given respect for being a particular kind of woman , rather than simply a human being. You have to respect the ladies in a different way than you respect men. Because otherwise that might lead to gender equality. 5. Yes, Thomas, that's why Catherine was horrified to find out that HER RAPIST HAD CUT A LOCK OF HER HAIR AS A KEEPSAKE. Because hair smells good, and is infused with womanly essences. NOT BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY INVASIVE AND CREEPY AS FUCK. And that final quote. Do I even have to explain that no woman acts like a victim ? The problem with this book is that it revolves around a murderer who hunts, terrorizes, dismembers, and kills women. So let's assume he hates women, or at least harbors a lot of rage toward them. Then there are the male psychologists who are attempting to understand him, and thus, in a professional setting, use words like \"bitch,\" for instance. Are they trying to mimic what they see as the thought patterns of the suspect or do they routinely refer to women as bitches? It's not clear. There's little to no framing language or verbal hedging that allows us to make that distinction. The male detectives are trying to track and identify the subject, but they don't let that stop them from enjoying a good rape joke at the crime scene; meanwhile Saint Thomas (he of the dead wife) feels vaguely unhappy about it but doesn't do anything to stop them. Even Rizzoli, who is female herself, seems to dislike, suspect, and resent women almost as much as her male colleagues do. I can't separate the narrative from the authorial intent. All I know is that it sucks, okay? It's full of rape, casual misogyny, and an almost subliminal devotion to the idea that women are VICTIMS VICTIMS VICTIMS. Also, according to this, the sole thing that makes a person female is the uterus or -- god help me -- womb as they insist on calling it half the time. Again, that's probably just what the detectives see as the suspect's mindset, but the conflation of uterus and womb is problematic on any level. Not everybody's uterus is a womb. After all that it seems petty to complain about the stilted introspection, the purple prose, the lengthy italicized sections where the murderer talks about his craft in the most pretentious language imaginable, or the fact that I didn't like any of the characters, but I'm still going to complain. Rizzoli might grow on me, though, so that leaves me with the difficult decision of whether to give Gerritsen another try. This is a mediocre book about a terrible subject made worse by clumsy writing about rape, VICTIMS (not, let's be clear, survivors), and being female in a male world. Um, not recommended for anyone. I've read a lot of trashy thrillers in my time and I will shrug off a lot of iffy things in the interest of mindless entertainment, but this set my mind into angry overdrive.

Maura Isles is not in this story and Rizzoli is no Angie Harmon, (and probably one of the most dislikable heroines I\u2019ve ever read- more on that later) If you\u2019re at all sensitive to blood and vivid medical details (or rape) then this probably won\u2019t work for you either as the surgical element here is graphic, bordering on overdeveloped \u2013it\u2019s pretty obvious that author <---A>Tess Gerritsen</---A> is a physician. Having said all that, this was still a fantastic read. The writing is excellent, the story fast paced, and all the characters are well developed. The plot is suspenseful, gritty and terrifying concluding with one hell of a bad guy. In fact I would say this was hard to put down except for the fact that I was so creeped out I dreaded picking it up (does that make sense?) Anyways, I definitely felt the need for a change of pace after this, like chick-lit or something fluffy with puppies. The Surgeon centers around a series of murders taking place in Boston. The young women are all found at home, in their bedrooms and the crime scenes are a bloody mess, the bodies sliced up and missing\u2026an internal body part. The precision of the killer\u2019s methods suggests a medical background and the media dub him \u201cthe surgeon\u201d. Investigating the murders are detectives Thomas Moore and his partner Jane Rizzoli -described as homely, self-loathing, jealous (and just downright bitchy) Through their investigation the police soon discover almost identical killings several years back in Georgia. However that case was closed when the victim fought back, shooting her attacker. Are these Boston slayings the work of a copycat then? Seeking out that last victim, Moore and Rizzoli find Dr. Catherine Cordell, now also living in Boston. After consulting with her they discover that these new slayings are being recreated with chilling accuracy. As the murder spree continues \u201cthe surgeon\u201d gets closer and closer to his intended victim, almost taunting the police and they can\u2019t catch him, and they can\u2019t protect Cordell from a ruthless hunter. There is a bit of romance here to break up all the medical procedures but Rizzoli remains an unlikeable character throughout, with her guard up to such a degree that it\u2019s no wonder none of her colleagues want to work with her. Luckily we get several other POV\u2019s to choose from and Detective Thomas Moore was a welcome distraction. We also get inside the head of intended target and former victim Catherine Cordell and \u201cthe surgeon\u201d himself who remained anonymous to me until the very end. His internal dialogue is freaky. Speaking of which this whole book freaked me out, it\u2019s so well written but just not an enjoyable read, as it\u2019s dark, vivid, bloody and quite the ride. I\u2019ll be looking for more from Tess Gerritsen. ...more The Surgeon is a remarkable, wonderfully well-written thriller. I had never read such an amazing story like this in my whole life.

Tess is one of the best and I am so honored to have the opportunity of reading her books. ...more Trigger warnings: rape, mutilation, medical details (both descriptions of stuff like cancer and descriptions of accidents/operations). That had to come first, because I spent much of this book wishing I had something firm and indestructible to crawl into, to keep me safe.

And, as with that, I had to read to the end to find out who the killer/torturer was, before I could begin to feel okay again.

And, as with that, I had to read to the end to find out who the killer/torturer was, before I could begin to feel okay again. (The part of me that's done a course in Crime Fiction remembers that the end of a crime novel typically ends with the criminal being contained or killed, and therefore that provides a feeling of safety and the reassertion of the rules of society, for a reader.) I wasn't really a fan of the characters' attitudes to rape. The idea that rape makes the victim belong to the attacker in some way is just repugnant, and the idea that what makes a woman a woman is their womb is just -- ugh. It seemed to be an ongoing theme in the story, rather than an opinion expressed by just one or two of the characters. Overall there was a lot that upset/troubled me, and despite Sasha Alexander being in it, I don't think I'm going to watch the tv series. It's not actually a bad crime/mystery book: it's very good in that sense, and I'd recommend it to people who like, for example, Val McDermid. But it was just not the kind of thing I should be reading at all, and I'm going to steer clear. ...more I've been wanting to start reading this series for a while, and I was very lucky to find this book at a book swap library thing at the Botanic Gardens (I can't remember exactly what it's called, but basically you can take a book when you put a book there, or return the book you took...now I am confusing myself...).

Anyway, it was a great read! It took me a while to really get into it, but after about a quarter of the way through I found it difficult to put down. I have watched a couple of episodes of the TV show and I must admit while I liked the way the tv show portrayed Rizzoli, I think I preferred her in the book. I like my characters to have flaws and not be the most attractive person in the whole world. Rizzoli is a gutsy and courageous woman and puts up with crap from the other male detectives that she shouldn't have to. Tess Gerritsen shows off her medical knowledge quite extensively within the book, and at times is quite detailed and a bit gory. The story was clever, held my attention and I was kept guessing right until the end. Gerritsen is a great writer and I look forward to reading the next one. ...more If you're just coming into the Rizzoli and Isles books, be aware that these are very different from the AMC series. Dark, gruesome, and complicated, the series follows the strong Detective Jane Rizzoli through several fascinating cases. (Maura Isles plays a bigger role in the later books, though I'm not as big a fan of those that focus on her.) The writing is excellent, the stories are mostly consistently good, and they're terrific thrillers for fans of Chelsea Cain or Karin Slaughter.

If I\u2019m honest I nearly gave up reading this half way through, it was kind of boring me a lot and I found the medical jargon was too much, too annoying and uninteresting. I found that it took away from the flow of what was basically a good mystery/crime story. The crimes are pretty gruesome so if you are any way squeamish at all, I would give this a miss. I\u2019m glad I did finish it because I felt it picked up a lot towards the end, hence my three stars, I didn't hate it and didn't love it but there was obviously enough in this first book to make me finish it and to make me want to read the second book in the series at some stage. \u2018Isles\u2019 in the partnership \u2018Rizzoli and Isles\u2019 doesn't make an appearance in this book so I\u2019m looking forward to meeting her character in the following books, although I didn't find Rizzoli's character as endearing as I wanted. I found her to be quite whiney at times. Understandably she's trying to prove herself in her male dominated workplace but at times her thoughts and actions came across as childish and immature. Overall, this is a good murder mystery but I hope the rest of the series improves on this one. ...more https://poseidons99.wordpress.com/201...

It's an engaging enough mystery and wouldn't be much more if the character of Boston Homicide Detective Jane Rizzoli weren't so vivid and interesting, standing out in a story that involves both a nastily imaginative serial killer and an embarrassingly trite romance. More positively, Gerritsen is herself a physician so I enjoyed the medical detail. There was enough entertaining about this book that I'd read a few more in the series to see where it goes with the hopes Gerritsen improves on her dialogue writing (I wanted to die inside reading the passage where they speculate on the killer taking women's reproductive parts as souvenirs as \"that's the one thing makes them women.\" Oh Tess Gerritsen. Seriously?) FYI, my paperback had a preview chapter of another Gerritsen book, \"The Bone Garden.\" If this matters to you, this is not a Rizzoli and Isles book. The next book in that series is \"The Apprentice.\" ...more 4.5 stars. Wow, this book definitely surpassed all of my expectations!

Tess Gerritsen's writing is phenomenal. Everything felt very authentic and realistic and I think a lot of that is down to how much she knows about medicine, detectives and serial killers. It's obvious that Tess Gerritsen put a lot of work into weaving this story but she makes it flow very nicely. I liked her writing style too, it kept my attention on the story. The story was so gripping and interesting from the start. The one thing she could improve on is the way her characters interact. There was just something off about their interactions. One thing I really liked about this story was that I didn't guess the killer. Then again, there weren't really any suspects and we were only getting snippets from his mind so I couldn't have guessed it anyway. I liked how we didn't know who could have been The Surgeon. I did guess a lot of other things but I still really enjoyed it and I definitely wouldn't say it's predictable. I love reading about serial killers and I felt like her killer was very believable. I like how Tess Gerritsen didn't go for shock factor or drama, she went with a story that was awesome. The only thing that I would question would be the authenticity of Gerritsen's representation of a woman in a detective unit. I know it was published about 14 years ago but I did question how the male detectives treated Jane Rizzoli. The book had a lot of misogynistic characters and while the story itself was anti-woman, the book felt a bit anti-man. I did like how the two main women in the book were represented though. Jane Rizzoli was a tough cop and I liked how she thought outside of the box. Catherine Cordell was smart, brave and likeable. I liked how the romance in this book took a backseat. It didn't take over the story, it worked with it and complimented it. The ending was explosive. Gerritsen built up the ending nicely and it didn't disappoint. I will definitely be reading more from Tess Gerritsen as I'm really impressed. I would recommend this to everyone except people who don't like dark and gruesome things. It definitely deserves it's rating on Goodreads. ...more This is a pretty creepy, fast paced medical thriller.

The Boston Homicide Unit, Rizzoli, Moore and Frost are on the case and have noticed the similarities in these rapes and gruesome murders. Women are being butchered and their uterus removed, but only those who were previously raped. The Boston Homicide Unit then deducts that Catherine Cordell, an ER surgeon at Pilgrim Medical Center, is a link to these crimes. During the course of the investigation the killer, nicknamed Surgeon, is taunting Catherine in numerous ways and her strength and perseverance begins to crumble. Catherine tries desperately to keep her painful memories safe for she feels that no man will love her if they find out she is damaged. Rizzoli has issues of her own. Having a family who does not support her role in law enforcement, she also feels insecure about her looks, plain and not pretty like the other women around her. She deals with harassment from the men in her department and is determined to solve this case to gain respect. Much of it backfires. She becomes jealous of Catherine and Moore\u2019s relationship during the investigation and is thrown off the case, but this doesn't stop her. I was appalled at times with Rizzoli\u2019s attitude and disliked her more and more as the story progressed. Unprofessional and too insecure about herself. I really enjoyed Moore (aka: St. Thomas) and Peter who is Catherine\u2019s friend and surgeon partner in the ER. Supporting characters were placed in just the right areas and were written in well. There was a lot going on in this book and I sometimes wondered if it was fillers but reading on I realized the characters were there for a reason toward the end. There is a lot of forensics and medical terminology in this book which was somewhat boring to me but was needed in order for the mystery to flow evenly with the investigation and then solved. The serial killer\u2019s MO and signature was mixed, which kept me in suspense and sometimes threw me off balance when other clues were presented. The killer speaks in italics, weird stuff, and is not revealed until the end. This was a book that had me entertained from beginning to end. The writing style was bold and skillful. A gripping serial mystery that kept me on the edge of my seat. ...more 4,5/5 Okudu\u011fum en manyak,en rahats\u0131z edici kitapt\u0131.Beklentilerimi fazlas\u0131yla kar\u015f\u0131lad\u0131.Tam bir polisiye/gerilim kitab\u0131yd\u0131.

You aren't getting the clues much before most of the characters, and you're not going to be able to guess the murderer early on. On the plus side, this means you don't spend much time frustrated at the characters for being idiots.

On the plus side, this means you don't spend much time frustrated at the characters for being idiots. But it was disappointing to discover that most of my theories were pretty much invalid and there was no way I would have been able to work it all out on my own. But if you like thrillers, this one works quite well. The pacing is good and the protagonists generally aren't stupid. It's nothing we haven't seen before--deranged serial killer is seriously screwed up, sex crimes, attempts at psych profiling, escalating violence, women in peril. But it's perfectly enjoyable, even if it's nothing special. I do have some bones to pick. Rizzoli has good reasons to be prickly, but it still gets grating. Moore, on the other, hand, apparently falls in love in about three days and is rather too gooey. I would have liked some more red herrings--I would also have liked some more development of the clues. (The murder has a weird skin condition that sounds like a huge deal, but then gets completely dropped, for example.) I'm not entirely sure how they managed to make the arrest at the end, unless they swept some of Rizzoli's rule-breaking under the carpet. The thing that actually bothered me most, though, was the treatment of the whole uterus-removal thing. Over and over again, especially at the beginning, they hammer home the idea that this is the one thing that makes the victims a woman and that this is the worst possible thing that could be done to them. I don't think most women who have had such procedures done on purpose consider themselves to be no longer women. For that matter, I suspect my trans friends would have Things To Say about this. Is it horrifying and scarring, both physically and mentally? Of course. But were I to be a kidnapped by a deranged serial killer and operated on and managed to survive the ordeal, I'd rather him take that than, say, my hands or my eyes. It just seemed kind of ridiculous and insulting for this to be harped upon as the Worst Thing that could possibly be done. I guess we're talking about a genre where every possible horrible thing has been explored, and the author wanted to make sure that her Horrible Thing was sufficiently Horrible. But it just seemed unnecessary. Anyway, competent but not inspiring. Triggery as all hell, but if you're inclined to be triggered, you really shouldn't be reading murder mysteries featuring sex crime serial killers. ...more I read up a little on the author Tess Gerritsen and found out that she is a medical doctor who, by the way, writes detective/thriller novels.

It came to no surprise that The Surgeon is a \"medical suspense\" kind of detective story. The prime suspect is nicknamed \"the surgeon\" because he likes to do surgery on his victims. He's a real sicko. Boston Detective Thomas Moore and his partner Jane Rizzoli are put on the case to solve a series of murders. There are other members on the team that create tension with mostly Rizzoli because she is the only female detective in the department. Moore sticks up for her because she's his partner and he doesn't have a problem working with a woman. The characters are all pretty well developed both in their on-duty and off-duty personas. The story grips the reader right away and keeps that tension right through to the ending. The plot is multi-layered and keeps the detectives on their toes. A potential target is Catherine Cordell, a trauma surgeon at a local hospital. She is the only person who has survived an attack by the The Surgeon. Therefore, she is a strong person of interest in the investigation and plays an integral part in the story. There are a couple scenes where she is treating patients. There is a lot of medical terms thrown around and the work that doctors do to kind of provide a canvas for the story. I listened to audio book and the narrator does a credible job with all the characters. The female voices were a little on the weak side in my opinion. This isn't a major distraction though and makes the audio version a worthwhile choice. The story is a gripping suspenseful read. If you like this genre, I recommend this book. ...more This is a book that I probably would've never picked up on my own but, Amazon offered it briefly as a free download so, I decided to check it out.

It is a fairly standard serial killer thriller but, don't let that dissuade you from reading it. \"The Surgeon\" is gripping suspense and Gerritsen is a gifted story teller. The story centers around a serial killer in Boston who performs living dissections on his female victims. At times, the story is extremely grizzly but the juxtaposition of descriptions of the Surgeon's exploits with those of a female surgeon, who is the focus of the killer's wrath, give the novel a context that is often missing in suspense fiction. It is unfair to compare the writing in a mystery or thriller to that of a more \"literary\" genre, however, it is Tess Gerritsen's writing which propels this story. The believability and vulnerability of her characters pulls the reader in and the sections of the book told from the perspective of the killer border on tortured genius. \"The Surgeon\" had me clicking through the pages as fast as I could read them and at the end of the day, that is the job of a successful suspense novel. ...more ~~~~~BLURB~~~~~ In Boston, there's a killer on the loose.

Heart stopping read that kept me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails while reading as fast as I could turn the pages. Intense suspense at its best! I will return to write a full review. I may not watch the Rizzoli and Isles TV series, but I do watch CSI: Las Vegas .And one thing that stays into my mind while reading the Surgeon is that, this is like Crime Scene Investigation paperback style without any hot lab technician! Aw man. What we have is an insecure female Detective, a surgeon who is haunted by a fuckward killer, a male detective who I still don't know how to categorize and a brilliant psycho who has by far, the most interesting narration in the whole book. Not trying to b I may not watch the Rizzoli and Isles TV series, but I do watch CSI: Las Vegas .And one thing that stays into my mind while reading the Surgeon is that, this is like Crime Scene Investigation paperback style without any hot lab technician! Aw man. What we have is an insecure female Detective, a surgeon who is haunted by a fuckward killer, a male detective who I still don't know how to categorize and a brilliant psycho who has by far, the most interesting narration in the whole book. Not trying to be a bitch...Oh alright! I'm being a bitch. But I have so much expectations with this book that I practically took a day off from work just to finish it. So let's start what makes this book rub me the wrong way. Jane Rizzoli : The detective with insecurities. Sweetie, we all suffer from insecurities,but good God, can't you honestly just get over it?! The tough chick act only works for a few chapters before it got annoying. I get it that has to be all tough and macho because she works in a place where the testosterone level is higher than the fucking Everest, but I keep on getting irritated when she whines to herself that she deserves some respect, she deserves to be given credit for what she earns, she deserves this and that and IT'S GETTING ON MY NERVES! Here's the tip detective. You can't demand to your co-workers to respect you for being a female detective, when you get even annoyed by your gender. Show them that you can be a woman and be tough, rather than deny feminism and act all manly just to be recognized as brave. P.S: You better watch Game of Thrones. Tyrion has a wonderful quote that you should learn. The relationship between Rizzoli and Moore : Totally non-existent for me, but the book keeps on insisting that they have one. We already established the fact that Rizzoli has some self- issues to work with. What I also don't understand is the, \"friendship\" of Rizzoli and Moore. First five chapters: She hates him because she thinks he's there to take the case from her, seeing she's a woman and incapable of handling a case. Keyword: HATE Chapter six to twenty or so: They become friends of sort.There's been no swapping of saliva or any form of body fluids have been mentioned. Just that, Rizzoli started seeing Moore as her best friend, seeing he's quote \" different from the other male\"unquote . She may also start getting possessive. Keyword: POSSESSIVE Last chapters: She hated Moore again because he fell for Cordell and he proved to be just another male who fells for woman who has tits and ass. She had also explained that she's jealous because Moore is having a romantic relationship with the victim, in which she saw as unprofessional.They're friends, but she acts like she's Moore's unlucky wife...Gah. Keyword: JEALOUS Here's also another con for the book. The medical terms and explanation I know that the author just want to explain the scenes more properly by throwing in medical words and procedure but, for some simple-minded people like me, too much scientific and medical words is a guarantee to make me bored. There are moments in the book where the suspense is killing me then the author would put a lengthy explanation about what the doctors/ police are saying, thus deflating the moment. I may be comparing this novel to some Sidney Sheldon books, where it's fast paced and the author just gave you enough facts to make you understand the context and yet at the same time, let you die of suspense.Some people get high by reading medical words. I get turned off by it. This book is not bad.If you want icky scenes where blood and guts are available, good plot and awesome facts, then this book is for you. Despite my review, it' s still a good book in which I can recommend to some of my friends. But if we have the same taste of books and same feelings to annoying MC, then let's just sit in the sidewalk and watch the reactions of those who reads this book. ...more 4,5 estrelas O Cirurgi\u00e3o foi a minha estreia com a autora Tess Gerritsen.

Eu nunca vi, por isso comecei o livro \u00e0s cegas. A ac\u00e7\u00e3o decorre em Boston, na qual um homem anda a assassinar mulheres. Estes crimes s\u00e3o peculiares porque o assassino n\u00e3o se limita a assassin\u00e1-las: ele entra na casa das v\u00edtimas durante a noite, deixa-as inconscientes, despe-as, amarra-as \u00e0 cama com fita isoladora, espera que as v\u00edtimas acordem e depois d\u00e1 inicio ao seu trabalho... um trabalho nojento e repugnante, que me arrepiou todos os pelinhos do corpo! E que trabalho \u00e9 esse, perguntam voc\u00eas? Ele abre as mulheres, retira-lhes o \u00fatero, deixa-as a sofrer e depois corta-lhes a garganta. Depois de terem a gargantas cortadas, as v\u00edtimas ainda vivem mais uns minutos, afogando-se no seu pr\u00f3prio sangue. Arrepiante n\u00e3o? O que tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 arrepiante \u00e9 que estes crimes apresentam semelhan\u00e7as gritantes com outros crimes acontecidos h\u00e1 mais de dois anos, os quais culminaram na morte do criminoso e na sobreviv\u00eancia da sua \u00faltima v\u00edtima, a doutora Catherine Cordell. Ent\u00e3o quem anda a perpetrar estes crimes horrendos? E porque escolheu precisamente aquelas mulheres, mulheres que n\u00e3o s\u00f3 n\u00e3o se conheciam, como se moviam em c\u00edrculos diferentes? No inicio fiquei um pouco preocupada. Uma vez que Catherine \u00e9 cirugi\u00e3, trabalha num hospital (\u201cdahh, \u00f3bvio!\u201d, dizem voc\u00eas) e uma das cenas iniciais passa-se no hospital em que Catherine est\u00e1 a tentar salvar uma vida e h\u00e1 imensos termos t\u00e9cnicos. Pois bem, eu estudo Gest\u00e3o, n\u00e3o Medicina e aqueles termos para mim eram chin\u00eas! Ao l\u00ea-los s\u00f3 pensei: Depois entrei no ritmo do livro, e embora ainda tenha havido termos t\u00e9cnicos j\u00e1 n\u00e3o eram t\u00e3o frequentes nem t\u00e3o condensados, o que me permitiu descontrair e apreciar a leitura. O livro aborda um tema tabu da sociadade: a viola\u00e7\u00e3o. Gostei bastante da abordagem que a autora deu a este tema. Ela representou o que eu penso ser uma imagem bem real das mulheres que passam por este trauma e da maneira como v\u00eaem o mundo e as pessoas que as rodeiam. Houve uma frase que uma personagem disse que me ficou gravada na mem\u00f3ria que foi mais ou menos assim \u201cOs homens v\u00eaem as mulheres violadas como mercadoria estragada\u201d. Sim, penso que alguns homens s\u00e3o capazes de pensar assim, mas felizmente existem outros que conseguem ver para al\u00e9m da superf\u00edcie. Conseguem ver a mulher e respeit\u00e1-la por ter sido forte o suficiente para superar um trauma t\u00e3o brutal quanto a viola\u00e7\u00e3o, tal como Moore e Falco. Fiquei deveras feliz com a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre Moore e Catherine, achei-os perfeitos um para o outro. Outra coisa que gostei foi o POV do criminoso. \u00c9 algo que sempre me atraiu e julgo que sempre me atrair\u00e1: \u201cver\u201d a mente dele a funcionar, como ele planeia, o que o motiva, o que ele extrai dos seus crimes. E o Cirurgi\u00e3o tem uma mente brilhante pelo que senti imenso prazer em ler as suas cenas. A detective principal, Rizzoli, no \u00ednicio n\u00e3o gostei muito dela. No fim j\u00e1 gostei mais um pedacinho, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 das minhas protagonistas preferidas.

Au\u00dferdem detailgetreue, liebevoll entwickelte Figuren, die sich gut in die Dramaturgie einf\u00fcgen und sich fast immer konsistent gem\u00e4\u00df ihres gezeichneten Charakters verhalten. Ich fragt Euch nun sicher: Wo bleibt meine Begeisterung und warum stehen dort oben nur 3 Sterne? Das ist schnell erkl\u00e4rt. Der erste \u00c4rgerfaktor ist die in den sehr brutalen Krimifall f\u00fcrs weibliche Zielpublikum mit Gewalt reingequetschte Romantikgeschichte. Wenn ein geb\u00e4rmutterherausschneidender Psychopath hinter mir her ist, habe ich wirklich besseres zu tun, als mit dem Kommissar herumzuschnacksln, mit meinem Arztkollegen zu flirten und mir romantische Gedanken \u00fcber die beiden zu machen, welchen ich jetzt erw\u00e4hlen soll. Auch verhalte ich mich als toughe Chirurgin, die zwar nach einer Vergewaltigung durch Verdr\u00e4ngung und Abgrenzung wieder alles im Griff hat, der aber der alte Fall erneut wie ein Bumerang ins Gesicht schl\u00e4gt, nicht so ambivalent romantisch und l\u00fcstern, da habe ich andere Probleme. Soweit so gut - dieses Konzept wird m\u00f6glicherweise vielen von Euch sogar sehr gefallen. Ich bin eben keine Leserin, die der Meinung ist, dass Psychothriller und Romantik in einem Roman zu mischen, eine gute Idee darstellt. Das weitaus gr\u00f6\u00dfere Sakrileg ist aber die zur Romantik dazupassende blumig ausgedr\u00fcckte Bildsprache. Ich bin sehr f\u00fcr Methaphern und plakative Bilder, aber man kann das schw\u00fclstige Tussengelaber auch \u00fcbertreiben. Beispiel gef\u00e4llig?: \"So wie Catherine einen Teil ihrer selbst in Ninas Augen erblickt hatte, so erkannte auch Nina sich in Catherines Augen. Die stumme Schwesternschaft der Opfer.\" \"Er streckte die Hand nach ihr aus. Sie betrachtete sie durch einen Schleier von Tr\u00e4nen. Und wie eine Ertrinkende, die die schwazen Meeresfluten der Rettung vorzieht, griff sie nicht danach.\" W\u00c4HHHH! Kitschiger geht es gar nicht mehr und auf der n\u00e4chsten Seite plant der irre M\u00f6rder gleich wieder gaanz rational wie er seine Opfer optimal qu\u00e4lt! TS TS TS sehr realistisch. Wo hat die Autorin zu fabulieren gelernt? In der Nachhilfe-Schreibschule f\u00fcr Bianca-Liebesromanautorinnen? Vom Winde verweht trifft das Schweigen der L\u00e4mmer. Fazit: Guter Krimi, sehr schlechte Sprache und das mit der Romantik im Plot ist so gar nicht passend. Definitiv mein letzter Gerritsen-Krimi, denn dieses gew\u00e4hlte Konzept wird sich auch in Band 2 nicht gravierend \u00e4ndern. ...more This is a hard book to review; I wanted to give it 3 Stars but its effect made me bump it up to 4. I started it on Saturday and finished it on Sunday; when I went to bed on Saturday it stayed with me and gave me vivid, horrible dreams. Most books don't have that effect.

I started it on Saturday and finished it on Sunday; when I went to bed on Saturday it stayed with me and gave me vivid, horrible dreams. Most books don't have that effect. Before going into my review, this isn't the Rizzoli & Isles of TNT's show (which I love); if anything this is what R&I would be on FX or HBO. It's gritty and dark and what a true \"crime thriller\" is meant to be. Overall, the narrative isn't wonderful. It is a good thriller and a page-turner. I needed to know what happened next. And, in the end, I wasn't disappointed with the story. However, there are a lot of issues I had this with book. First, as some of the other people mentioned, Rizzoli isn't a sympathetic character. I found her brash and annoying. She has a chip on her shoulder that the male detectives don't respect her, but throughout the book I didn't see her act in anyway to warrant respect. She ignored protocol, she went off on her own and kept leads because she wanted the credit, and she lashed out at her partner multiple times. She was a miserable person. One point Rizzoli is home with her family and her brother is in town and she thinks about how they don't respect her, but they respect him. She thinks something along the lines of as a Marine he only played at war, while as a police officer she was living it. This is insulting to soldiers and to police offers -- this shouldn't be a reflection of our police force. It also felt at times as though Gerritsen was writing about an outdated attitude towards females in the police force; which is insulting as a woman reading. I found everyone's attitudes frustrating. The POV was confusing. I still don't know if this was meant to be a book based on Rizzoli or her partner Moore. It seemed to flip midway through the book. We follow Moore to Savannah, where we learn a key piece of evidence, and suddenly when he returns the rest of the book exclusively follows Rizzoli. Gerritsen also flips at the end of each chapter and shows us the villain's thoughts -- but never explains why or what this is. Is it just random musings? It gives us insight into the criminal but it felt out of place. Unless we knew more. The writing is also a bit too much. The medical and technical explanations were well done, if a bit much at time. There was a tendency to be repetitive and to tell the reader something, then show it. I'd say with that there was at least a quarter of the book that could have been cut off. Will I read the next one? Eventually. I'm curious to see the introduction of Dr. Isles, but I'm not rushing out to read it and will probably allow a few books before I read that. ...more Bu kitab\u0131 neden okudu\u011fumu anlatabilmem i\u00e7in \u00f6nce sizi biriyle tan\u0131\u015ft\u0131rmam laz\u0131m.
