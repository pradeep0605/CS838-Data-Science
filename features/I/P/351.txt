This is one of those it was the right book for the right time scenarios. I had just finished reading Nineteen Eighty-Four and Fahrenheit 451 and, suffering a dystopian hangover, needed something light that didn't involve too much thinking. This certainly fit the bill. From the get-go we have a stereotypical plot: two sisters (one pretty but dumb and the other smart but plain) who are insanely jealous of one another despite their bond. However, this stereotype exists because there is a component of jealousy in many same-gender sibling relationships. No matter how much the two love one another, siblings often feel as though they are being compared to one another by parents, family, friends, society at large, and examined for deficiencies that become obvious when compared against their genetic foil. The smart one always wants to be pretty; the pretty one always wants to be smart. The athletic one secretly wants to be a book nerd; the book nerd always wants to be able to dunk a basketball. The one with curly hair always wants straight hair; the one with straight hair longs for curly locks. We end up envying precisely what the other hates or loathes in himself or herself. Maggie and Rose are no exception. There's some rich material to work with here, and Weiner does realistically portray the root causes of the sisters' envy for one another. She also takes some chances: further complicating their relationship is their mother, whose mental illness leads to her death while the girls are still young; the beautiful Maggie suffers from a debilitating learning disability that effectively limits her chances at success in the entertainment industry (she can't read the teleprompter during an MTV audition that she would have otherwise had in the bag); Maggie betrays Rose's trust to such a magnitude that their relationship may be beyond repair (no one can hurt you like a sister and Weiner takes advantage of the opportunity to challenge the sisters' relationship). Oh, and thank heavens she didn't take the route of making the overweight Rose thin by the end. Having said all of that, there were certainly some things I did not love. There's a subplot involving the long-lost maternal grandmother that slowed down the narrative for me. Also, Maggie and Rose just weren't likable characters. These are not two women I would ever want to know in real life. They're self-involved and often petty. I'm also not buying that Rose quit her job to become a dog walker, nor that Maggie lives in the Princeton library and miraculously becomes a literary genius (by the novel's end, Maggie's reading every great literary classic she can get her hands on and spouting poetry like a water fountain). I'm not saying that someone with a learning disability is incapable of doing this, only that Weiner never plausibly made me believe Maggie was capable of doing this. If there was one perk of the inclusion of Maggie's reading of One Art by Elizabeth Bishop, i carry your heart with me(i carry it in by E. E. Cummings, and several classic literary texts, it's that it reminded me that there are certainly better books out there and, even though Weiner's work was somewhat humorous and mildly entertaining, maybe my time would be better served reading some of those. Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder ...more This book was surprisingly enjoyable - a lot better than some of the other chick lit shit I've read. I would have given it another star, but the movie (which I've seen many more times than I should probably admit) did a much better job of building a story arc and tying up the various plot lines. To the point where it's like, that's so perfect and obvious, how did <---A>Jennifer Weiner</---A> not think of doing that herself? But still, thumbs up for the book. This is another fun novel from Jennifer Weiner. I was curious to read it because I had seen the movie version (starring Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette) and I liked the story about two sisters who were total opposites, and yet still found ways to love and help each other. It was a pleasant, enjoyable read. It's hard to believe that Rose and Maggie are sisters - it seems the only thing they have in common is their shoe size. Rose is the responsible sister; at age thirty, she's a lawyer at a successful firm, and she's finally found herself a good boyfriend. Maggie is twenty-eight; she is the attractive sister. Despite her looks, she has not held a job for very long at all. Flighty and irresponsible, she detests Rose's approach to life.

Rose is the responsible sister; at age thirty, she's a lawyer at a successful firm, and she's finally found herself a good boyfriend. Maggie is twenty-eight; she is the attractive sister. Despite her looks, she has not held a job for very long at all. Flighty and irresponsible, she detests Rose's approach to life. Unfortunately for the sisters, Maggie is forced to move in with Rose due to financial circumstances. Angry with Rose for nagging at her so much, Maggie decides to get even when Rose's boyfriend shows up at their door. Rose is heartbroken when she walks in on her boyfriend having sex with Maggie...and Maggie wearing her shoes. Rose kicks man and Maggie out of her apartment, yelling that she never wants to see either again. So begins Maggie's journey to find herself, first at Princeton, and then on a mission to find the girls' maternal grandmother. Tired of living in Rose's shadow, she is determined to find her niche - and subsequently forgive herself for what she did to her sister. Rose has a journey of her own - as her now-ex was one of her coworkers, she finds herself taking a leave from her job to follow her heart and decide what she really wants to do. Weiner has intertwined the stories of two very different women into a novel that is both humorous and dramatic. Readers will enjoy <+++>In Her Shoes</+++> and will be able to identify with both Maggie and Rose by the end of the book. ...more Jennifer Weiner can write funny passages.

So it's exactly what you'd expect. 500+ pages seems like a long march towards the inevitable. ...more It seems Weiner must have had a terrible jerk for a father and stuck up leech for a sister, because all her books seem to dance around this. I read Weiner hoping to find a new stronger \"Good In Bed\" but never do. This book was entertaining but not good. I refused to watch the movie because the main character should be at lest a tad fat. Instead, in typical Hollywood fashiong, they just made a thin girl homely. This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm gonna be honest, I was a little skeptical of it. I am not one to really get into girly books: books about shopping, and dating, and partying. I usually like the more dramatic fiction, but I fell in love with this one!

The story is ultimately about two sisters: the free spirit, partying, beautiful sister, and the uptight, chunky, plain sister. The only thing these sisters have in common is the death of their mother and shoes. So begins the story. Maggie and Rose are characters that anyone with a sister can relate to. After Maggie does something horrible to her sister, they each try to go their separate ways, and walking in the other sister's shoes (hence the title). In the end, the sisters end up happily back together, in the most adorable ways possible, and each come out better for it. The poem that Maggie read at the end was heartbreaking, and really shows how tight the bonds of sisterhood can be. A definate tear-jerker (but in a happy way), and one of my new favorite books.

I didn't dislike the story, it just wasn't my favorite. ...more A nice light read, but with some interesting not always fun truth about family. It has this perfect balance between fun and seriousness. The sisters love each other, but there is this older younger sibling dynamic going on that has stuck since childhood. Both have things to learn and do in order to break away from that and that was well written and I was happy with the ending. It was good without becoming corny. Don't get me wrong, this book is not awful. However I felt that it was too long for just a story of 2 sisters and their grandmother and even when I got half way through, it felt as though the story was going no where interesting. I have not been able to finish it, though I am still interested in the story and may finish it at some point. I just feel that my efforts can be put into more captivating books.

With every word that I read from the figurative pen of Miss Jennifer Weiner the closer I feel I become to her. In Her Shoes is, in my opinion, her best literary work, with perhaps the exception of Good In Bed.....Eh, all right, it's a tie. In Her Shoes is the totally relate-able tale of two sisters whom don't realize that they have as much in common as they really do. On one side is Rose --- responsible, dependable, kind of vanilla Rose whose only great passion is shoes and ice cream and who makes the mistake of dipping her pen in the company inkwell (if ya know what I'm saying --- and on the other side is Maggie ---- beautiful, vivacious, troubled, misunderstood Maggie whom has never gotten a real chance out of life and struggles to prove herself more intelligent than everyone has ever told her she was. These two sisters rarely get along, barely tolerate each other, and know exactly how to push each others buttons --- in other words, they're completely believable characters --- and when Maggie pushes Rose for the last and final time, Rose is ready to throw her only sister out of her life forever. It's during the time that they're separated, however, and forced to move through the slow-moving tides of their equally difficult lives without the familial support of a sisterly shoulder that they realize how important they have always been to each other. Don't let the thickness of this book scare you. YOU HAVE TO READ IT! It's only one of the best contributions to the chick-lit genre since Rebecca Wells took a break from churning out Ya-Ya stories. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll call up your sister and apologize for pulling her hair twenty-something years ago, you'll go out and buy a new pair of ridiculously expensive yet oh-so-worth-it shoes, and more than likely, run out and buy every other word that Jennifer Weiner has ever thought, much less written. Oh, and *spoiler alert* I have to talk about this certain part in the book, because it is perhaps my most favorite thing ever to be written. About halfway through the book, after Maggie and Rose get into it, Maggie runs off to the train station and decides to hop the track over the Princeton University, where she proceeds to spend the next three or four months living in the basement of the library! How friggin awesome is that! I mean, maybe I'm just that kind of person, one who would love the opportunity to just sit around and read books all day and night, but that was just, like, the neatest thing that I've ever heard of in my life. If I thought I could get away with it, I would totally be hopping a train to Princeton right about now. ...more Ok ~ Well I almost burned the book!

I however think that there could have been A Lot less details on somethings and A Lot more details on others. The last 1/4 of the book definitely needed to be examined much more. And the last part of the book did feel rushed (just like so many others had warned). I don't think I will read any of her other books, as through others reviews, it sounds like her books have a cookie cutter shape. And I really really did not enjoy the first solid part of this book, and I really don't wish to relive that in another. ...more This story is about two sisters , Maggie and Rose, who lost their mother when they were young and grew up with a cantankerous wicked stepmother .

I am the proud owner of 9 more paperbacks that I have zero room for (but at a total bargain!) I loved the movie version of this. Toni Collette is amazing in everything ever and I think I love her a little bit? Like she may have been 90% of the reason I bought this. Long story short I have it so I suppose I'll read it at some point. This book was about 400 pages too long. They could have made it cute and fun. It never went anywhere ... it was totally predictable and I kept waiting for some twist. BORING. I love girl books but this one took way to long and the book ended about half way through. I kept thinking the book was to familiar (sometime is read things again without realizing - that is why I use Goodreads now) but then I realized I think I saw part of the movie on TV at some point. Guess that is why I kept picturing Shirley McClain as Ella! My first stab at \"chick lit\". Entertaining, but also long-winded and editing mistakes drove me crazy. Also, subplots and characters disappear without explanation, or seem completely unnecessary. The main characters are unrealistic and unlikeable. Bad. Just bad. Resisting the urge to burn it, but only to avoid accruing overdue library book fees. Many good moments and interesting thoughts, sadly coupled with questionable drivel. The humour sometimes bordered on offensive, as seems too often the case with today's chick lit/comedy fiction. It's the story of three women.

The humour sometimes bordered on offensive, as seems too often the case with today's chick lit/comedy fiction. It's the story of three women. Rose Feller is a plain, conservative, bright thirty-year-old lawyer in Philadelphia. Her younger sister Maggie is a learning-disabled, shallow, irresponsible young woman who loses one job after another and keeps a string of boyfriends. Ella Hirsh is an old widow in Florida with a heavy secret. What connects the three of them is the premature death of Rose and Maggie's mother, who was also Ella's only daughter. After an ultimate fight between the sisters, each of them begins a journey of self-discovery that will lead them ito Ella's doorstep, and eventually to happiness. The problem with this book? The first\u00a0hundred pages. I understand the author's need to establish the setting and the characters, but when you've read any summary or review of the story before picking up the novel, you know what's coming up (Rose and Maggie's fight, Rose and Jim's breakup), and you can't wait till it happens. For a while I really wasn't sure I was going to like the book, because of how impossible it was to get into the story. The characters were like caricatures to me. So, okay, it's a comedy, but that part is not even that funny. It's just... stereotypical, artificial, and over-the-top. Rose is the ugly, brainy, reasonable big sister. (But she's not actually that ugly, she just lacks self-confidence because of her \"stepmonster\", a botox-filled, snobbish woman who's always trying new \"weird\" diets, like... vegetarianism. o_0 Yeah, I know; me too.) Maggie is the hot, uneducated, flighty little sister. (But she's not actually that stupid, she just lacks self-confidence because she is a victim of the school system.) It feels like reading large print in bold letters, underlined. Just to be sure that you picked that up: Rose is the ugly, brainy one with a good job; Maggie is the pretty, shallow one without a job. You can repeat after me to check you got it right. (And all the while I was wondering, \"Is any real person even remotely like either of these sisters?\") I'm being a little cruel here. But the thing that bothered me the most, maybe, was how much it contrasted with the rest of the book. The rest of the book, FYI, I liked. It made me laugh, it brought tears to my eyes, it made me smile and sigh and nod with understanding. But it isn't all in the writing, in the narration, or in the plot. It's in the meaning : how does the rest of the book account for such a beginning? The Rose and Maggie we discover after the Big Fight are suddenly much more interesting, much more real and enjoyable than the ones who were initially introduced. So my question is: how did women who can actually realize and achieve all that , live for respectively 28 and 30 years without showing the smallest inkling that they could? Why would an unmarried, childless lawyer have known about Three Bears Park, a tiny pocket of a playground between Spruce and Pine Streets? Would a woman who took the same route to work every day have known that on the five hundred block of Delancy every house flew a different flag? How could she have suspected that the shops and grocery stores would be bustling at one in the afternoon, filled with people in khakis and sweaters instead of business suits and briefcases? Because she is old enough, duh? Don't get me wrong, I loved this part. I could finally relate to it. My point is that the Big Fight is overplayed. No matter how big it was, I don't believe that it can change a person's life so completely and suddenly. You've got to have it in you, or it's going to be an extremely long road. You can challenge me on this one, but from my perspective, thirty sounds like a mighty advanced age to me to make such naive, baby steps into life. What I loved about the book basically reminded me of my adventures between ages 18 and 22. When you first get into the adult world and learn how men work, how dating works, how jobs work, how city life works. How you work. What you want. What you can do. She was having... what? [...] Fun. Well, not fun exactly, not fun like a party was fun, not fun like getting dressed up and looking great and feeling people's jealous eyes moving over her was fun. It was a challenge\u2015the kind of challenge that her series of dead-end minimum-wage jobs never gave her. It was like being the star of her own detective show. Also, I liked Maggie's story better than Rose's, though it's obvious that Rose is the main character. Now another thing about In Her Shoes , is that many things are very predictable (again, an unfortunate consequence of the obvious, exaggerated, repetitive beginning). Like which guy she's going to end up with, what job would be ideal for her, and whatever would do her good. All this I could tell from a very early point in the novel. But what happens to Maggie and Rose right after the Big Fight, I couldn't have foretold. And it's really cool, and original, and fun. That's what makes In Her Shoes a good book, in spite of everything I criticized. Moreover, remember it's a light and easy read, so if you're the least bit curious, you'll still read through the first hundred pages without too much trouble, like I did. I guess it's worth it. ...more Ero indecisa se regalare a questo libro due stelle oppure essere pi\u00f9 generosa e dargliene tre.

Her messed-up sister Maggie comes to visit and basically throws a hand-grenade into Rose's life. Maggie moves out, and the novel follows her, alternating between what Maggie does with her life and what happens to the sister she left behind. The novel is basically a story of change, growth, and reconciliation. Of the two, Maggie's story is more elaborate. She grows the most because she has the farthest to come. However, I found some of her choices hard to comprehend; they seemed out of character for her. The person she is at the end of the book seems completely different from the one at the first of the book. Great arc, but I think she needed to have more pages to make such a drastic change. Rose changes her life too. She takes a leave of absence from work, and then immediately starts a job as a dog walker, of all things. I'm sure that was meant to be a metaphor, but it seemed like a really dumb thing to do, like leaving a medical practice to serve coffee at a kiosk. Especially baffling was that she didn't seem to have any problem with her job prior to the event that made her want to leave. Why not just switch firms? I think the weakness of this book is that it spends nearly equal time with Rose and Maggie, when Maggie is the only one who really needs to change. All of Rose's \"changes\" seemed like a step in the wrong direction. She moves from a man she adores to one she's ambivalent about. She moves from a career that challenges her intellectually to one that doesn't pay a living wage. I'm not going to get into specifics, but I felt the conclusion, where Maggie figures out how to make it up to her sister, a little forced. There was another scene, as well, that introduced tension that didn't get resolved. I'm not going to say this book isn't worth reading. I did like the characters, and some of their adventures amused me (Maggie at Princeton). However, this isn't Weiner's best work. ...more In Her Shoes by Jennifer Weiner tells the story of sisters who couldn\u2019t be more different. Rose is a successful Philadelphia lawyer while Maggie is between jobs, apartments and boyfriends. When Rose walks in on Maggie and Jim, the man Rose dreamed of marrying, Rose has had enough. Sick of taking care of her little sister, Rose throws Maggie out, quits her job at the law firm and unexpectedly starts a dog care business.

Rose is a successful Philadelphia lawyer while Maggie is between jobs, apartments and boyfriends. When Rose walks in on Maggie and Jim, the man Rose dreamed of marrying, Rose has had enough. Sick of taking care of her little sister, Rose throws Maggie out, quits her job at the law firm and unexpectedly starts a dog care business. Maggie, with nowhere to go runs to the one place she never thought she\u2019d fit in: Princeton University, Rose\u2019s alma mater. Pretending to be a student, Maggie successfully lives in the library for a semester, until she is found out. With no one else to turn to, Maggie calls her estranged Grandmother who lives in Florida and books a one way ticket to the sunshine state. Ella, Rose and Maggie\u2019s grandmother hasn\u2019t seen her grandchildren since her daughter and their mother died years before. She isn\u2019t quite sure how to begin a relationship with them and is grateful when she has the chance to reunite with Maggie and later Rose. Each chapter is told from the perspective of Rose, Maggie or Ella. Hearing each woman\u2019s voice allowed me to get into their head. At times, I truly hated Maggie, but after hearing her side of the story, I was able to empathize with her. The book has a heartwarming ending and a happy reunion between the two sisters. While the book is a little more dramatic than most sisterly arguments, having a younger sister myself, I was able to relate to some of the annoyances that Weiner describes. Unfortunately, I saw the movie (and didn\u2019t like it) before reading the book. After reading Weiner\u2019s other books, I have to say, this isn\u2019t her best. It was a bit slow to get through and I found it hard to identify with the characters. However, if you are a fan of Good in Bed and Certain Girls, you\u2019ll be delighted to know that Cannie Shapiro makes a cameo in this book! The lesson I took away from this book was that no matter what, sisters are forever. People come and go, but a sister will always be a sister and will be there for you when you least expect it. ...more The story of two sisters, Rose, is a successful but dowdy lawyer and Maggie her irresponsible but beautiful younger sister. My favorite parts of the book were the sections with the sisters' Grandmother, Ella, and her friend Mrs. Lefkowicz; and the parts with Sydelle, the evil stepmother. Ella lives in a retirement village in Forida and writes for the local paper. She has a male friend who is interested in her romantically and leads a pretty full life.

My favorite parts of the book were the sections with the sisters' Grandmother, Ella, and her friend Mrs. Lefkowicz; and the parts with Sydelle, the evil stepmother. Ella lives in a retirement village in Forida and writes for the local paper. She has a male friend who is interested in her romantically and leads a pretty full life. Her friend Mrs. Lefkowicz is a straight to the point type of woman who knows a lot more about modern life than her friends ever could have guessed. Sydelle is a witch of a woman always putting the sisters down and ruining their lives whenever she can. She is one of the characters that you love to hate, and I always looked forward to her next assault on her step-daughters sanity. Rose was kind of a perplexing character, she seems like she has it together although she gets invoved in an office romance but it happens so often it is hard to fault her for it. Then she gets all wierd, Rose catches this man in bed with Maggie and cuts off ties to both of them. Since the man from her firm was her superior she takes a leave of absence and begins to date another lawyer at the firm. She becomes engaged to him and doesn't tell him that she used to sleep with his employer and of course he finds out the hard way. And that leaves Maggie, I found her character to be dispicable. She steals from EVERYONE, she uses people and isn't capable of thinking of anyone but herself. After she has destroyed every relationship that she had with any one that cared about her she tracks down Ella, and moves in with her. She becomes a personal shopper for the elderly in the retirement village and turns her life around. But through it all I found her so unlikeable. I actually saw this movie before I read the book and I don't remember disliking her character. I would suggest that anyone interested i9n reading this should stick to the movie. ...more Notes for me: Well, zipped through this book in 3 days so obviously a fun read. There are a lot of great things about this book that made it a pleasant thing to curl up in bed with but for one huge black hole named Maggie Feller. I know this is the character with the most to learn and she has to have an arc, etc etc but I really loathed her. She was so completely self involved. The world revolved around her for 95% of the book and her last second maturity was not enough for me. It meant I had to Notes for me: Well, zipped through this book in 3 days so obviously a fun read.

The world revolved around her for 95% of the book and her last second maturity was not enough for me. It meant I had to put up with her narcissism and selfishness for most of the book. If I ever knew anyone who would steal from me, wreck my things and live with me without contributing a thing, who used people as if they were put on the planet for that express purpose, oh god help me. I really hated her. Which is too bad because the idea of a character who has been sold on the fact that her body and sex appeal is all she has to offer is a really interesting thing to explore. Our culture which reduces women to only their bodies and women dealing with that is a territory which should be explored. Really enjoyed Rose and her journey. I had visceral pleasure at her kicking out the ungrateful Maggie and idiot Jim. I adored Simon. This was a woman I'd enjoy lunch with. Loved spending time with Ella and Lewis. The Golden Acres community was a nice place and I liked that getting older wasn't treated like a horror show or a sad, lonely destination. Weiner is an author that I enjoy, In her Shoes just didn't work for me because of Maggie. I debated tracking down the film but I may need to wait. Have one more of her books in my shelf, Goodnight Nobody. Looking forward to it. ...more A cute book... though not thrilling. I remember liking the movie, strangely much more than I enjoyed the book, which is a rarity. I was disappointed to say the least. I suppose I'd heard so much hype about this book that I had higher expectations and was sadly let down. However, I appreciate the opportunity I've had to read this for myself. \"Meet Rose Feller.

She also dreams of getting her fantastically screwed up little sister to get her life together. Meet Rose's sister, Maggie. Twenty-eight years old, drop-dead gorgeous and only occasionally employed, Maggie sings backup in a band called Whiskered Biscuit. Although her dreams of big screen stardom haven't progressed past her left hip's appearance in a Will Smith video, Maggie dreams of fame and fortune-and of getting her dowdy big sister to stick to a skin care regime. These two women with nothing in common but a childhood tragedy, shared DNA, and the same size feet, are about to learn that their family is more different than they ever imagined, and that they're more alike than they'd ever believe.\" ...more We all grow up with the weight of history on us.

We all have family problems and this is a great way to understand a different point of view, of one of your family members. The aspects I liked about this book were, in the beginning you thought it would be just about how messed up one of the main characters Maggie Is. It turns out it is about so much more. Such as Losing someone you create a bond with, growing up, and re-creating the love that has been broken between two sisters and their family. Honestly there was nothing I didn't like about this book. It caught me by surprise when it was about so much more than I expected, and I love surprises. If you like surprises, and you like drama you should read this book. It has many life lessons in it. Such as family are always the people who are there for you at the end of the day. This book is especially good if you have a sibling, you realize just how special they are, how much you need, and love them too. ...more Wow - I can not believe I'm giving this a 4* review, considering that I'm often a snob about 'chick lit'. But this was a great read - categories be damned! Sure, it is a book by a woman for a (most likely) female audience about almost exclusively female characters. But more importantly it's a sweet and sad story of two sisters trying to behave like adults (or not, in the case of one sister) and live their lives.

I almost couldn't put it down despite being able to predict exactly what would happen. The sisters captured my attention and the story took me happily along on the ride with them. I especially liked the relationship that develops between the younger, wilder, 'problematic' sister and her grandmother, a woman she only connects with as an adult. I haven't seen the movie that was made of the book - and in the past would have turned my nose up at it! - but given how much I liked the book, I'd be tempted to... ...more", "Title": "In Her Shoes"},
