{"Comments": "Fantastic conclusion to a truly amazing trilogy! <---A>Brandon Sanderson</---A> is a masterful storyteller.<---F> BOOKTALK HERE: https://www</---F>.youtube.com/watch?v=u4k99... As I finish this trilogy, I feel like addressing this book on two levels: first, on its own strengths and weaknesses as a novel; and second, as the capstone of the series and as an exposition of the Mistborn world and mythology. I\u2019ll start with the latter of the two. The overwhelming impression I get from the Mistborn books is that they have been written by someone who is a fantasy fan first, a fantasy author second. A pedantic geek, if you will. And I mean all of this as the highest praise \u2013 San As I finish this trilogy, I feel like addressing this book on two levels: first, on its own strengths and weaknesses as a novel; and second, as the capstone of the series and as an exposition of the Mistborn world and mythology. I\u2019ll start with the latter of the two. The overwhelming impression I get from the Mistborn books is that they have been written by someone who is a fantasy fan first, a fantasy author second. A pedantic geek, if you will. And I mean all of this as the highest praise \u2013 Sanderson clearly has a fanboy\u2019s love of internal consistency,<---M> and distaste for discontinuity</---M>, and is writing the kind of books that he would like to read. In essence, he is both the author, and the slightly Aspergian fan at the fantasy convention asking that author some annoyingly penetrating questions. This is a man with a proper appreciation for words like canon and retcon . Because of these qualities, Sanderson is without a doubt the most consistent, airtight world-builder I have ever read. As the series builds, slowly revealing more and more of the world, the various types of magic, and the overarching mythology, everything snaps into place perfectly. And what\u2019s more, it becomes obvious that everything has been perfectly laid out behind the scenes from the very start. Completely absent is any feeling that the author was making things up as he went along; I never once found myself having that \u201c Sure Luke and Leia were always supposed to be siblings, George\u201d feeling, nor even that \u201cYou know, Jo, when Hagrid got out of Azkaban prison at the end of your second book, he acted as though it was no big deal\u201d feeling. And this is great for me, because I\u2019m a pedantic geek myself when I read fantasy and sci-fi; it\u2019s naturally difficult for me to suspend disbelief, and I\u2019m constantly mentally peeking around corners and poking at curtains. And here, in the place of that nagging skepticism was an actual sense of wonder, as every big reveal sent me scrambling back mentally, trying to figure out how I didn\u2019t see that coming. This is definitely a series that would reward a second reading. (That Sanderson was the one tapped to finish the late Robert Jordan\u2019s Wheel of Time series now makes all kinds of sense, as he is pretty much an iron-clad guarantee that fans of that famously deep and involved fantasy universe will not be disappointed.) What\u2019s better is that this magnificent world is paired with an excellent story. There\u2019s little of the slow (though, in retrospect, necessary) build that made up much of the first part of the first book. Instead, <+++>The Hero of Ages</+++> comes out guns blazing (not literally, though firearms are mentioned in passing). The plot is fast-moving, yet everything builds towards a monstrous climax that ends up taking up the last full quarter of the book. The resolution of the plot is mind-blowing, moving, satisfying, and it ties the entire three-book story up elegantly. It\u2019s impressive that Brandon Sanderson can put this neat a bow on such an epic tale, when far more experienced writers like Neal Stephenson and Stephen King still occasionally hit-or-miss. It seems to me that Sanderson improved as a writer over the course of this series \u2013 unsurprising, given how young, prolific, and obviously dedicated to the craft he is. That is not to imply he\u2019s a great writer just yet, as his chops continue to catch up to his impressive imagination. There are still some jarring lexical choices: words like guy and tsunami , and terms like \u201chat trick,\u201d feel out of place even in the context of Sanderson\u2019s straightforward modern American English. And dialogue is still not a strong point; group conversations in particular still come off kind of stilted and awkward. But there is obvious, measurable improvement in the writing from the first book to the third in this series, and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to reading more of Sanderson\u2019s work. Postscript: Wow, I'm surprised by the number of \"likes\" on this review. If you enjoyed it, please feel free to check out my reviews of the first and second books in the trilogy. Cheers! ...more This was the most perfect series finale I can remember reading... I cannot... I just........ A review will be on my channel when I can form words. This \u2018review\u2019 is not a review of the book, but more of my emotional journey through reading it and upon finishing. For those of you who have read the Mistborn trilogy, I think you can empathize with what I felt. For those of you who haven\u2019t, I ask that you do yourself a favor, and feast upon these books.

Before the end, I was going to write an absolutely glowing review full of caps lock and exclamations points and gifs and pictures and my This \u2018review\u2019 is not a review of the book, but more of my emotional journey through reading it and upon finishing. For those of you who have read the Mistborn trilogy, I think you can empathize with what I felt. For those of you who haven\u2019t, I ask that you do yourself a favor, and feast upon these books. For they are truly the most amazing books I\u2019ve ever read. Before the end, I was going to write an absolutely glowing review full of caps lock and exclamations points and gifs and pictures and my singing glorious praising to high heaven to clearly show my ultimate love and devotion for this book. But I just can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. I am hurting. I\u2019m in so much pain. Never before has a book put me through such emotional turmoil, rendering me to a sobbing, terrible mess, with my heart ripped to pieces, bleeding on the floor, my chest aching, my mind, near in shock. I didn\u2019t want this to happen. I didn\u2019t even consider something like this, especially of this magnitude, happening. Sanderson put me through hell. But I cannot hate him. I cannot hate his prowess in making me go through all of this pain, and yet leaving me with feelings of indescribable joy and breathless wonder. I closed the book with such a wonderful feeling of satisfaction and completion, not wanting in anything save for that I didn\u2019t want it to end. It was a difficult journey, yes, but any journey worth making is worth the trials. And this particular journey, was most possibly, the most rewarding journey I\u2019ve ever been on in the literary world I thrive on. When a novel really makes me feel , it becomes more dear and precious to me than any other book. It shines brighter, dark as the tale may be, tearful as it may make me. But that is what readers are looking for. A story that speaks to their heart and soul, pours emotion into them, making them feel everything the characters are feeling, and lingers well after the last page. And this is what I treasure. Any novel that can do this to me, even though it may not be the best written or executed, is one to be cherished dearly. This novel stands out though. Not only does it make you feel deeply, it has outstanding world building, an incredible cast of characters that you love dearly, and a brilliant execution of a story that leaves you in breathless awe. I knew this series wasn\u2019t all happy endings and rainbows and light. It is a terrible, dying world with an unknown force beating upon it. Horrible ramifications will happen, there is no escaping them. There is no hope of creating a happily ever after for everyone, and creating a world anew without some type of destruction and loss. People die, thousands of people. People you care about. My heart was torn out and trampled on. And it\u2019s still trying to put itself together again. This is a dark tale. Sanderson doesn\u2019t paint it light. He shows you what becomes of a world destroyed, what happens after its thousand years of relentless abuse. But , even then, even through all those dark moments, there are moments of light, of love and joy and laughter. And hope. Faith and hope, I believe, is the core of the novel, what makes all the characters press onward in hopes of a brighter future. The mists, the darkness are ever pressing on them, but they never give up hope. They never stop believing that all could be well if they but fight to secure it. I can\u2019t write this review and not talk about the characters. I can\u2019t talk specifically about what they did that I loved, or their personal thoughts and journey, lest I spoil the book. But I can say that I adore these people with every fiber of my being. They are not just characters moving a story forward, they live and breathe and are REAL . When they were in pain, I was in pain. When something terrible happened to someone I loved, I cried, my heart raging inside, aching and furious at what was happening. But oh how wonderful they are, how glorious their stalwartness and love and self-discovery over the course of their lives. One such person, whom I love and respect and praise, was Sazed. Dear Sazed. Your soul searching quest was perhaps the most riveting and saddening. I ached watching you despair and lose your hope that you had held onto the whole of your life until something devastating sent your doubts flying, your faith failing. But it all paid off! Everything you learned, discovered about your life\u2019s devotion of studying religions. Therein was the faith you needed, you just had to look at them with a new light, a different perspective. And I loved what you became. It was so perfect for you, and made my soul soar with happiness. And then Vin and Elend. Their characters were brilliant. Their outcome, their destiny, jaw dropping, and\u2026 I cannot say more on them. You need to discover this on your own. You will come to love them, and you will ache deeply when terrible things happen to them. But the pain is not all for naught. You have to feel pain for them to connect you to them, to make them real, to make the story and their characters believable and entrancing. The ending was heartbreaking, but so perfect, it couldn\u2019t- shouldn\u2019t- have happened any other way. And even though thinking that disheartens me, it was remarkable in its execution, and ended with a perfect brush of the light and new found joy that I was so desperate to find. With the ever present mist and ash and red sunlight, I yearned for the characters to find their blue sky, and yellow sun, and green grass. They never knew of those things. With a thousand years of red sky and brown landscape, such things were preposterous, laughable. Vin believed in it though, because Kelsier did. And this vague image of a better, brighter, lively world full of color, brought them a measure of hope and desire that fueled them in their desperate actions to find this better world, where Inquisitors and Ruin cannot abound, and where peace and light reign. One last character whom I thought was brilliantly crafted, even more so after his death, was The Lord Ruler. I never could have imagined his role in the story, his true intentions that were misunderstood by those seeking to overthrow him. Sanderson created the most unbelievably cruel, good villian. He is not what he seems, and is only a pawn of something even more devious and cunning and ruthless than he ever could be. The whole plot, how everything came together, the realization of what certain things meant, was utterly brilliant. It\u2019s mindboggling to think that someone could concoct such a story, such a world, being so attentive to every single little last detail that is essential in making the world work and have no problems in its making and telling. Sanderson is a mastermind genius. I could never be as superb as he is, but I hope I could be half, or a fourth, or a hundredth so brilliant with storytelling and drawing people in. I almost forgot Spook. Erica, what are you thinking ? Ah, Spook, you captured my heart. You became the man I was hoping you would be. You never lost yourself, but you became so much more. And I loved it. I loved your growth and love you had and strength. You, with Elend and Sazed, are my hero. I sincerely urge you, plead you, to read the Mistborn Trilogy. It is so outstanding and perfect and thrilling, you will find you cannot stay away from the world once you enter, and will dread leaving it. What truly, is more amazing than these books? Though I have read them just this year, and there are still thousands of books out there to read, I have a feeling I will not find another read more brilliant. And though I don\u2019t read much epic fantasy (which I think will change soon), I believe the Mistborn trilogy stands out in this genre, and is more than worth reading and loving. They have become my favorite books ever; nothing I\u2019ve read comes even close. And this is why I wish everyone on earth would read these books. I will recommend it to everyone I can. When I love a book so deeply and desperately, I can\u2019t not tell everyone of its brilliance, and that they MUST read it. And you must. You must if you want a book that arrests you completely, and leaves you with such deep emotion and love and wanting more . I can\u2019t praise these books enough, and I hope I have been able to sway you to read them. You will not regret it, trust me. ...more Well, that ending . . .

Vin & Elend. I will always love you both \u2665 \"You've led us to die!\" Fatren yelled. He was covered in koloss blood, though a patch on his shoulder looked to be his own. \"Why?\" Fatren demanded. Elend simply pointed as the speck grew larger. \"What is is?\" Fatren asked over the chaos of battle. Elend smiled. \"The first of those armies I promised you.\" Vin fell from the sky in a tempest of horseshoes, landing directly at the center of the koloss army.

I love his journey and how he used what he learned from Kelsier and Vin together in playing his role. There are so many characters I love in this series and I'm sad to leave them behind again. I didn't start out loving Breeze but he became one of my favorite characters (His wit reminds me of Wit in the Stormlight Archives). Elend and Vin remain one of my favorite couples in Fantasy. Kelsier is still such a strong force in the story. Sazed and his journey and part in the story made sense when we finally got there and I always love how he is humble and genuine with everyone. His journey couldn't have ended any other way I think. Stronger even the second time through. Original Review 4.5 Allomantic Stars Buddy read with the ever awesome Athena So a few months back I was lucky enough to meet Brandon Sanderson at an event and subsequent book signing. He signed my book with the following I thought while reading Mistborn that he put that inscription in the wrong book. Boy was I wrong because <+++>The Hero of Ages</+++> had more secrets revealed than the other two books. In true Sanderson fashion this story builds slowly until it bursts and all you can do is hold on for the ride. I laughed and cried and loved so many moments. My heart might be a little battered by the journey but it is all the better for it as well. There are some fantasy series you read and you know that the author is just sorta making it all up as he goes along. Later in the series stuff from earlier books starts to fall apart and holes in prior world building become a little obvious. I never feel that way in a Sanderson book. I always feel like he had every part of the magic system and world building figured out before he ever started the first book. That with every layer he adds it is like a picture coming more fully into focus until you can see all the details more clearly and at the end of Hero of Ages I thought OF COURSE how could it have ended any differently. He is for the fantasy reader that loves all the details and respects the world building as well as the story. Sure some parts might seem a little slower at times but that is just because the world is so rich and it takes time to line everything up so you can knock it down perfectly. There are so many characters that I loved throughout the entire series and thankfully I got to spend time with all of them. I thought that all of the magic had been explained and talked about in the other two books but that wasn\u2019t the case at all and in this one Hemelurgy was at the forefront of the story. It made perfect sense once explained and fit in with the other magic\u2019s of this world. Everything that has been put for about this world is action and consequence or push and pull. Balance has been the driving factor and this remained true to the very end. With Ruin released a new balance had to be found to counteract his destruction and the possible end of the world. Ruin has been waiting millennia for this chance and is a master manipulator of men. Vin, Elend and the gang have their work cut out for them if they have a chance to win this war. \u201cWhy can't you see? This isn't about good or evil. Morality doesn't even enter into it. Good men will kill as quickly for what they want as evil men\u2014only the things they want are different.\u201d Vin, she has come so far from the first book. She has grown into a great hero and woman she has become more than Kelsier every thought she could be. I loved her and Elend in this book. They overcame their histories and became such a strong pair together. They have become more comfortable with the people they are and accept themselves. They had difficult times with the enemy but I enjoyed the tender moments when they were just together being the young couple in love that they are. \u201cElend smiled. \"Oh, come on. You have to admit that you're unusual, Vin. You're like some strange mixture of a noblewoman, a street urchin, and a cat. Plus, you've managed - in our short three years together - to kill not only my god, but my father, my brother, and my fianc\u00e9e. That's kind of like a homicidal hat trick.\u201d All the side charaters and other POV add so much depth and understanding to the story. My favorite PoV was TenSoon. The Kandra culture was such an interesting addition to the story just one more in depth facet. Spook also played such an interesting role as he has grown up and now plays a much bigger part. Sazed is always of interest and I didn\u2019t see the significance of his role until it hit me upside the head and I felt stupid that I didn\u2019t see it sooner. Sazed is a little lost and still in morning after losing the woman he loved and has lost faith. In searching through all the religions he has carried all these years he hopes to find answers but it seems that not one of them is perfect. Some of his ponderings of religions and faith were so interesting. I usually zone out at stuff like this as it can sometimes be preachy but I never felt like that and some of his discussions about religions and faith were the parts I loved in this book. \u201cIt sounds to me, young one,\" Haddek said, \"that you are searching for something that cannot be found.\" \"The truth?\" Sazed said. \"No,\" Haddek replied. \"A religion that requires no faith of its believers.\u201d <---C>Marsh</---C> wow Marsh\u2019s fate was one that was difficult. The struggles that he had with himself and what he has become. The battles between Marsh and Vin were epic and heartbreaking as once they saved each other\u2019s lives and now are enemies. Everything came full circle and the ending was emotional, as I wasn\u2019t ready to say goodbye to many of the characters in this. Now at the end looking back I don\u2019t see how it could have ended any other way and been right. ...more I CANT FORM WORDS I love how everything tied in at the end - I'm usually good at guessing everything but I kept being shocked by this book. The characters' growth was enjoyable to watch, the magic system and the world building became more and more complex which I adored! I didn't 100% love the ending but I still loved this book. I can't wait to continue with the next ones! I have a little time to read this book because of Ramadan. The Hero of Ages genres are fantasy and sci-fi.

A dark force bent on the utter destruction of the world has been freed from the invisible shackles that once bound it. The mists are engulfing the outer dominances, murdering people in the darkness. But in the centre of it all stand Vin, recognised in the Final Empire as 3.5 stars \"Ash cloaks the land in a mantle of black. The mists come during the day, killing both crops and people. Men march to war. Ruin has returned.\" The divine power hidden at the mythical Well of Ascension has been released. A dark force bent on the utter destruction of the world has been freed from the invisible shackles that once bound it. The mists are engulfing the outer dominances, murdering people in the darkness. But in the centre of it all stand Vin, recognised in the Final Empire as the fabled Hero of Ages, the one destined to save the world. This book is the last chapter of a legend. Mistborn: The Final Empire was a book about revolution, about standing standing up against oppression and fight for a better world. The Well of Ascension was a book about politics and civil war, about struggling to hold up a beacon of hope in a world of erupting chaos. And finally there is The Hero of Ages , a book about the ultimate struggle between preservation and ruin, about the struggle to survive through the end of the world itself. An interesting part of this book is its focus on religious and political fanaticism. There are fervent believers building their lives and thinking their thoughts based on both the Lord Ruler and the Church of the Survivor, both among the allies and the opponents of our protagonists. There are both extremely conservative and extremely radical dictators ruling their respective cities with iron fists in the name of the common good. While the fanatics themselves are rather intolerable characters, they illustrate the dangers of extremism particularly well, something that appears to be a main point for Sanderson in writing this novel. A rather unforunate aspect about the book is (I can't believe I'm saying this), the immensely high level of nostalgia involved. I almost always enjoy a bit of nostalgia when reading fantasy. When I've read an astonishing fantasy tale, I love being able to read a sequel that manages to look back and turn past events into legends. This book does that, so why am I disappointed? Because the nostalgia here makes the first book even better than it already was, while doing nothing at all for the third. Almost every scene in every chapter includes some mention of something or someone that is no more or how no one can stand up to the ideals and examples provided by the past. It seems even Sanderson realised that nothing could possibly be better than the first book in the series, so he looked back on that one with great fondness while writing this one. \"We\u2019re like children, playing a game we\u2019ve watched our parents play, but not really knowing any of the rules. And . . . our opponent created the game in the first place.\" It must also be said that the characters are weaker than ever in the series. Vin begins to doubt herself, Elend begins to doubt himself, even Sazed begins to doubt himself. When one considers that lots of enjoyable characters have also been lost along the path, the book is left with a bunch of uncertain people who have lost faith in everything from the gods to themselves. To their credit, they are all still fighting a desperate fight to save the world, but that does not make them any more interesting in my eyes. The antagonist is not as interesting as the antagonists of the first and second books, and more of a traditional 'pure evil' fantasy villain (despite eagerly claiming otherwise). Some characters, like Spook, get more interesting in this instalment, and some new characters, like Yomen, are definitely interesting additions to the series. Ultimately though, this book was character-wise a low point. So, did I hate this book so much that I'm only able to say negative things about it? Not at all. There are lots of positive things to say, but those things are often overlooked, because they've been a part of the series since the first book. Like Sanderson's flawless writing. Like the greatly interesting magic system known as Allomancy. Like the short, but astounding logbook entries that so elegantly introduce each chapter of the book. Like Sazed's hundreds of fascinating religions. And like the lowborn girl who became the most powerful Mistborn in the Empire, and the light-hearted, idealistic nobleman by her side. The book was filled to the brim with twists and revelations. Most of them were fairly predictable, but others again were not, and all of them were perfectly timed. The ending itself was as good as it could be. I cannot call it a satisfying conclusion (those of you who have read this book will understand that), but it was an ending worthy of a trilogy as breathtaking as this one. \"Somehow, we'll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be. But for now, we simply have to be satisfied with who we are.\" I feel like I need to write more, but suffice it to say that I enjoyed reading The Hero of Ages . I must admit that I was disappointed, but that disappointment may lie with my expectations prior to starting the book and not with the book itself. I had thought Sanderson would fulfil those expectations, and he did not, but it was still a great experience, and a great conclusion to an absolutely amazing series. And the Mistborn trilogy as a whole is something different altogether. There have been upsides and downsides to it, mostly the former, and in the end I must say that I am thankful to have been able to venture forth into the lands of the Final Empire and experience one of the greatest fantasy stories ever written through the eyes of Vin and her companions. ...more God, my emotions are all over the place. I've never read a book with an ending that made me so sad, but also so satisfied at the same time. I don't think that there would be a better way to end this series than this. It was just so epic. The whole series was. I think Sanderson is a really impressive author of the fantasy genre. It must be incredibly hard to insert originality into books of this type; so much has been done before and then done again. With Sanderson it feels like I\u2019m reading something completely new and completely exciting. His books and his characters are, simply put, cool . He just knows what his readership wants to see, and he gives it to them. The action scenes have an almost cinematic quality too them; they remind me of the combat I think Sanderson is a really impressive author of the fantasy genre.

The images of people flying through the air and kicking arse are vivid and plain awesome. I\u2019d love to see this on the big screen. Spectacular fighting There is, of course, so much more to this story that Sanderson\u2019s awe inspiring combat scenes; he has created an entire fantasy mythos around what originally appeared to be nothing but a rather basic story. It\u2019s just so good. Well, anyway, this book takes place a year after the previous one, and Elend is forced to take upon the role of Emperor. Previously, he has an idealistic approach to ruling; he was soft and morally righteous. But, there\u2019s no time for sentimentalists in this world. Elend has hardened his heart and become what necessity demanded him to be. The situation calls for a ruler not a diplomat; he has opened his eyes and seen the approaching threat of destruction. He\u2019s become a badass like his girlfriend. It was just in time too because his weakness could have got everyone killed. His personality is now drastically different. He is now Vin\u2019s equal rather than something she must protect. The threat to the Final Empire transcends the capabilities of a normal man; he had to become much more. Together, him and Vin can reap destruction on their countless enemies. So, essentially, he has become the leader he needed to be form the start. A doubt inevitably begins to burn within his soul (see what I did there?) and that is whether or not he becoming like the Lord Ruler himself. I love the way Sanderson does this; he captures internal conflict really well, as Elend questions morality and the necessary nature of being a strong leader. Exciting new point of view chracters Initially, I thought his was a bad idea. I though adding new point of views in such a late stage of a trilogy would be quite detrimental. But, I\u2019m glad to say it wasn\u2019t. Spook and Ken-Soon had some of the most exciting chapters in the book. It can become a bit tiresome reading, \u201cVin burned Pewter\u201d so it was fresh to see part of the story from these characters who in the end had a massive part to play in the final confrontations; it broke the story up and drove it into a more impactful ending. It also allowed for character development in characters that have been relatively ignored. Spook went on a massive personal journey. If I was to rate this book just on its action then I would give it five stars. I think the ending of the series was superb, but there was also another six hundred or pages or so to contend with. There were a few pacing issues. I felt like unnecessary things were drawn out, and what I considered to be important was rushed over. The ending was too fast; it needed more build up. The conflict at the beginning of the book had much more time devoted to it than the crux of the plot. However, these are minor issues, which make me sound very picky. The ending was superb and sad. This series has so much going for it. Go read it! The Mistborn Series 1. The Final Empire - A misty four stars 2. The Well of Acsension - A suprising four stars 3.

Gone are the linear plotlines of The Final Empire . The twists are intelligent and strategically placed . I almost want to reread the whole series to catch all the sneaky hints Sanderson placed in the first two books. I'm also really glad Spook has a larger part. He won my heart from the start with his endearing nature. Part of the reason I disliked Vin is how mean she was to him. (You were beaten every day by your brother, honey. Show a little compassion to your fellow street rat.) His coming-of-age character arc is long overdue and it's developed skillfully over the course of the narrative. A few criticisms. Where are all the ladies? Other than Vin, no other women have their own POVs or hold significant roles. Allriane (who I adore) barely shows despite being a powerful Soother, and Tindwyl was a plot device for Sazed to lose his faith. Beldre, the Citizen's sister, is a fascinating character I'd love to know more, but isn't properly fleshed out. It grates on me, especially when Vin is incredibly well-developed. I also never jumped on the Vin/Elend bandwagon. Their main thing is unconditional trust. So if Vin does something stupid, Elend lets her carry on, and vice versa. It seems to be a tremendously dangerous state of mind to be in given the events that happen (view spoiler) [Ruin controlling people. (hide spoiler) ] I understand it's connected to Vin's abandonment issues and Zane, but blind trust is never a good thing. (view spoiler) [Use steel to communicate if you must. (hide spoiler) ] On whole though, The Hero of the Ages is a brilliant finale to the Mistborn trilogy. Started with a sputter, ended with a hearty bang.

This trilogy is a definite must read for all Sandersonites ( which I have officially joined myself as a life long member ; ) ) I'm still an emotional mess at that ending and all it revelations. I can't barely even function right ( Damn you Sanderson ). Anyways, I need to go slip off into a corner and digest all that I have just read.

I'm extremely impressed with Brandon Sanderson's first fantasy trilogy. The entire story was carefully thought out, well-plotted, and well-paced.

The entire story was carefully thought out, well-plotted, and well-paced. What impresses me most is that in this last installment, The Hero of Ages, there are plenty of wonderful surprises left. But these surprises aren't little add-ons that Sanderson lately thought up and decided to throw in just to keep up the interest and excitement. These are major pieces of the puzzle that have purposely been left for the characters (and therefore the readers) to discover. Back in The Final Empire, the first book of the Mistborn trilogy, I thought Brandon Sanderson had created a unique and really cool magic system. That was nothin' \u2014 it gets even better! Finally, we understand the origin and purpose of the koloss, kandra, and inquisitors. Now we know what the Lord Ruler has been about for his 1000 year reign, what the mists are doing, and how people get allomantic powers. All of our questions are answered in fact, and you probably will have guessed some of the answers, but others will surprise you, I think. The end of The Hero of Ages is bittersweet, just as I like my fantasy. We are left with hope and light, not in despair, but there was a high cost to what was achieved. One thing I particularly liked about this series is the way that the \"bad guys\" are not universally and one-dimensionally evil (except for one, who is an evil \"force\"). Some of them aren't really \"bad guys\" at all. In addition, most of the characters are logical, no matter which \"side\" they're on. The \"enemies\" are just as reasonable, intelligent, and well-spoken as our heroes. Vin, Elend, Spook, Sazed (etc.) don't blow anyone away with superior plans, arguments, or bravery \u2014 they find that their antagonists are just as well prepared. As usual, the audio version of this novel is high quality. The narrator, Michael Kramer, is excellent, though he was inconsistent with Spook's voice. Mr. Sanderson has drastically cut back on the number of times a character \"paused,\" so that was no longer an irritation. I heartily recommend the Mistborn series for anyone looking for an original, well constructed epic which is satisfyingly finished in three volumes. If you listen to audiobooks, that's a great format for this series. If you have not read Mistborn, put it at the top of your list. Read the rest of my Brandon Sanderson reviews . ...more #1.)

Vin's death ignited something inside me and reminded me of the power that books can invoke and how it is truly unmatchable and indescribable. (hide spoiler) ] . Some things seemed so predictable that I thought maybe Brandon Sanderson was slacking, only to read the last few chapters and completely have the wind knocked out of me. The Hero of Ages might be the best book ending I've read to date. Which is so ironic, because The Final Empire had the best prologue I've ever read. This series is so worth the investment and I can't recommend it enough. This ending was heart wrenching, but it was heart wrenchingly beautiful and perfect. The Hero of Ages picks up where The Well of Ascension left off. Vin is feeling an immense amount of guilt for releasing Ruin from the well, even though she was just following what the (tampered) prophecy said to do. Elend is now a Mistborn, alongside Vin, and they are going city to city to find the stashes underground that the Lord Ruler left in preparation for this time. The mists are falling ever harder, and the days are almost nonexistent. No one can really grow anything, and the world is slowly starving while also ending. While the other two books in this trilogy seemed much more political, this final installment was much centered on religion. The crew is also separated for the majority of this story. Vin, Elend, Clett, and Ham are trying to take back Fadrex City, which is now being run by Lord Yomen with the Lord Ruler still being worshiped as their God, which means the same unfair treatment of the Skaa. Then we have Sazed, Spooks, Breeze, and Allriane who are supposed to be spying on the city of Urteau, which is run by The Citizen, or Quellion, who is pretty much a rebel leader who is oppressing anyone with noble blood. Seeing the juxtaposition of these two very different and extreme cities was fascinating. One chapter Elend and Vin are enjoying dancing at a ball while trying to make a statement (when Elend pulled out that book I cried happy tears and knew that it was going to be my favorite part of this entire novel), then the next chapter we have Spook trying to rescue noble bloods from house fire attacks. Fadrex City likes to pretend nothing bad is happening while relishing in their wealth and luxuries, while Urteau is embracing their poorness and lashing out at anyone who's even slightly noble. Spook has a tremendous role in this book, which I can only guess means he will do great things that we will hear about in The Alloy of Law , set 300 years after the events of The Hero of Ages . I was also very surprised that Tensoon has such a big part of this book! Vin and his relationship was my favorite part of The Well of Ascension . He and all the Kandra people were my favorite subplot of this book. I couldn't get enough of his chapters. Please, please, please bring him back (somehow) in The Alloy of Law . I also loved the relationship between the Kandra, the Koloss, and the Obligators. I can't believe I even questioned Brandon Sanderson's lack of twists. Speaking of Obligators, Marsh is set up from the prologue to play a big role in this book. I knew that every POV of his was going to weigh heavily on the ending. I feel so much empathy for so many of these characters, but Marsh seemed to get the short end of every spike stick! Sazed is constantly struggling to believe in something while also struggling with Tindwyl's death. I've always loved Sazed, so it really hurt me to see him lose his convictions and part of himself (view spoiler) [The irony of him going from an atheist to an actual god was also beyond perfect (hide spoiler) ] . I also wanted to mention Sazed and how freakin' right my The Well of Ascension prediction ended up being! (view spoiler) [I in no way, shape, or form knew what the Hero of Ages ended up being (hide spoiler) ] , but I think I still deserve a gold star of some sort. Vin is everything I would ever want in a starring character. I actually have doubts that I will find a female lead I will love as much as I love Vin. I always gush about her in all these reviews, but it's true. Brandon Sanderson created perfection when he decided to write Vin's character. Finally, Ruin and Preservations. Man, oh man, what a crazy ending. I'll be honest with you, I always knew Vin was different, but I had no idea the extent of how different. I was so blindsided. Especially about the atium. I didn't understand that until Sazed literally said it, and then Elend literally used it. Hopefully, we will eventually find out Ruin and Preservation's origin (view spoiler) [and who this red-haired Ruin really was (hide spoiler) ] . Basically, I just need a lot more of this cosmere universe in my life. Brandon Sanderson does not give a big fluffy bow ending as a wrap up for this story. He, instead, leaves many questions open, I'm guessing because of the spinoff series. The biggest new secret is perhaps that there is an additional two metals that no one knows about yet. This increases the total allomantic chart to sixteen! I don't even know what to expect, but I can't wait to start Mistborn: Secret History .
