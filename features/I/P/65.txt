But, alas, I cannot say that. So, all right, this is not the masterpiece that, say, \"Portnoy's Complaint\" is, but I also can't deny that Roth speaks to me on every page. And that's because the man refuses to lie about human sexuality and motivation. What he says makes a lot of people uncomfortable. In many quarters that's a prerequisite of art. And it's funny that reactions to him that claim to stem from positions of enlightenment (<---B>eg., offended feminist sensibilities</---B>) strike me as coming from merely a mutated form of Victorianism. Roth addresses that very American tendency in this book; he might as well have been quoting from Hofstadter's \"Anti-Intellectualism in American Life.\" So, yeah, on the surface this is about a professor who \"abuses\" his position of \"glamor\" and power to seduce students, or at least ones who've just graduated, his classes being part of the leading-up-to process of the conquest. But in this framework much is examined about aging and longing and the choices, good or bad or both, that people make in how they choose to live. There's much discussed about the mixed legacy of the sexual revolution of the '60s. The conflict between the \"bad\" father and the \"noble\" son, the latter overcompensating for the injustices of neglect he felt, is well examined, also. The fact of the matter is, I visited a professor yesterday on the campus where I work to gather information for a music article I am writing. He's in his 40s and has a well-known reputation on campus for plucking his plums among the student body. He does the very same thing that Roth's protagonist in this book does. He even introduced me to his latest \"assistant,\" a smoking hot young blonde ex-student whose knowing smiles to him during our interview spoke volumes. So this shit happens, folks. So yeah, shoot the fucking messenger. Readers need to stop personalizing so much when authors allow their characters to speak or act. I mean is the writing fabulous? Are the points well stated and thoughtful? Is there good basis in history and philosophy for what he talks about? YES, YES and YES! And Roth's characters get to be promiscuous and fuck, and you don't. Don't get so frustrated and take it out on him. I've just surpassed the halfway point, and Roth just fucking rocks, if you want to cut to the chase. Just finished. Roth says so much about life and death. There's a scene close to the end, the passing of his best friend. All I can say is, I've never read a more intimate and moving depiction of a person's last hours. And it's not drawn out. He says just what needs to be said. And then there's more, but, don't want to spoil it. <+++>The Dying Animal</+++>, the slow death of the body. Mortality. Who could have anything new to say? Does Roth say anything new? Maybe not, but it's all in HOW it's said. I had to give this five stars. Roth just leaves me so full, so satisfied. I can't rate it any less. ...more Oh, Mr. Roth, you're so dead-on when you write: \"You're not superior to sex\" (33).

A bastard, but clearly one that can foretell the upcoming dance (a total downer) of the elements of death and sex, & there are plenty graphic depictions of these both. In \"<+++>The Dying Animal</+++>\", Roth's mastery of whisking up just the correct ingredients to stuff a 156 page novella with, is impeccable: national themes, concerns & histories (his lifetime is marked most decidedly by the dawning millennium and the sex-and-drugs 60's) and personal anecdotes of sexual love (hot) and biological death (lame). It is a story about the sadness of sex and the literary thrill which comes from an immediate proximity to, a pronouncement of, death.

Philip Roth is a sexist pig. Who can argue about that? When he drags his mind off his wilting member for a week or so he produces Operation Shylock which is a minor masterpiece. But that was just a vacation. For years now he just rewrites the same story where some old geezer (himself) fantasises about shagging some young bird and then - just like life - gets to shag her. Bah. What a pig. Man of the World In the third of Philip Roth's <---C>David Kepesh</---C> novels, David is a divorced, semi-retired professor, philanderer, libertine and man of the world. He teaches a class in Practical Criticism and does book reviews on NPR. To his students, especially the female ones, he possesses an intellectual and journalistic glamour: \"They are helplessly drawn to celebrity.\" He reciprocates their attention, being \"very vulnerable to female beauty\". At the time the novel is narrated, David is 70. However Man of the World In the third of Philip Roth's David Kepesh novels, David is a divorced, semi-retired professor, philanderer, libertine and man of the world. He teaches a class in Practical Criticism and does book reviews on NPR. To his students, especially the female ones, he possesses an intellectual and journalistic glamour: \"They are helplessly drawn to celebrity.\" He reciprocates their attention, being \"very vulnerable to female beauty\". At the time the novel is narrated, David is 70. However, the subject matter is an affair that started eight years earlier and lasted over 18 months. Consuela Castillo is a 24 year old student when he meets her in his class. As he has done for the last 15 years, he targets Consuela for his advances, but resolves not to start a physical relationship until she has sat her exams and received her grade. This is his concession to propriety. Duchess in a D Cup Consuela's appeal is most immediately physical. David first spots her beautiful cleavage, then her gorgeous breasts, then her ample buttocks. Overall, she is a tall voluptuous Cuban; statuesque, marvelous, enticing and alluring: \"She knew what her body was worth...She has a D cup, this duchess, really big, beautiful breasts, and skin of a very white colour, skin that, the moment you see it, makes you want to lick it.\" Her appeal is, however, more than physical: \"She's not a demi-adolescent, she's not a slouching, unkempt, 'like'-ridden girl. She's well-spoken, sober, her posture is perfect...she dresses carefully, with quiet taste...not to desensualise herself, but more, it would seem, to professionalise herself...\" David implicitly differentiates himself from Humbert Humbert, because Consuela is adult, cultured, mature, not a minor, not a nymphet, not a victim, supposedly not an inappropriate object or target, academic propriety and age aside. But she is an object, a target nevertheless. Amadeo Modigliani - \"Le Grand Nu\" A Whopping Invitation David starts off interpreting Consuela's body as both a display and a \"whopping invitation\" that tells him \"that I need no longer suppress the wish to touch\". Apparently she has one of those bodies that articulates to sexually-active men: \"That body is still new to her, she's still trying it out, thinking it through, a bit like a kid walking the streets with a loaded gun and deciding whether he's packing it to protect himself or to begin a life of crime.\" Consuela doesn't resist David's approach. She does specify one constraint though: \"I can never be your wife.\" He can never legitimate his conquest in a convention. So far, perhaps, so bad. There is a lot of frank sexual description (not to mention psychoanalysis), at least of the women, in the novel. Up to this point, Roth seems to have created some mischievous, but good-natured, septuagenarian version of lad lit. If this were all you knew about Philip Roth and his writing, you'd be tempted to dismiss the novel as sexist and misogynistic. However, ultimately, there's more at stake, and the novel is more sophisticated and nuanced, even Proustian, than you would expect. The Gift of Stature Although David is the first person narrator, Roth delves into the basis of the relationship from both points of view, via his narration. David is an astute, if self-interested, observer. The relationship is nevertheless defined in terms of the male gaze. Consuela, initially, is something for David to look at, to watch over. She is not so much a sex object as an objet d'art. What Consuela gets from David in particular, in his opinion, is the authority of his educated gaze. He purports to judge her professionally: \"I had pronounced her a great work of art, with all the magical influence of a great work of art...she had only to be there, on view, and the understanding of her importance flowed from me. It was not required of her...that she have any sort of self-conception. That's what I was for: I was Consuela's awareness of herself.\" He admires her simplicity, her lack of complexity, even if it's not strictly correct to say that she lacks a self-awareness of her own. Moreover, it's David \"who fired up her senses, who gave her her stature, [and] who was the catalyst to her emancipation...\" The Professor of Desire sees his age-derived authority as mutually beneficial to his student(s): \"They do it for the age...my age and my status give her, rationally, the licence to surrender, and surrendering in bed is a not unpleasant sensation...she gets both the pleasures of submission and the pleasures of mastery.\" Of course, this perspective is still David's. Surrender seems to be more than succumbing to David's initial proposal. There is both submission and mastery present in the eventual relationship itself, one that Roth paints in terms of a (pleasurable and emancipatory?) master/slave relationship. The Author of Her Mastery As the relationship progresses, Consuela starts to see through David. She calls him: \"Mr Arrogant Intellectual Critic, the great authority on everything, teaching everybody what to think and setting everyone right!\" Conversely, he realises that \"she didn't desire me...she experimented with me, really, to see how overwhelming her breasts could be.\" Of course, breasts will win out every time! Inevitably, David feels he has lost whatever authority he had ever had in the relationship. He knows because for the first time he experiences jealousy. Ironically, his own authority is at the heart of the problem. It has succumbed to her mastery: \"[I had] inaugurated her into the sinister dream, the full amorous truth. The instinctual girl bursting not just the container of her vanity but the captivity of her cozy Cuban home. It was the true beginning of her mastery - the mastery into which my mastery had initiated her. I am the author of her mastery of me.\" The master has become the slave at his own behest. (Or is each lover always both master and slave? Is this the amorous truth?) The Fracture of Love Whether or not David realises it, he has undertaken a journey of his own. His starting point is a pretty masculine mindset: \"He who forms a tie is lost, attachment is my enemy.\" Inevitably he becomes attached. However, his friend, George, a Pulitzer Prize winner, questions what has happened to him. He diagnoses his plight in the following abstract and intellectual terms: \"You violated the law of aesthetic distance. You sentimentalised the aesthetic experience with this girl - you personalised it, you sentimentalised it, and you lost the sense of separation essential to your enjoyment...what lies behind the comedy of this Cuban girl taking a guy like you, the professor of desire, to the mat?...it's falling in love... \"People think that in falling in love they make themselves whole. The Platonic union of souls? I think otherwise. I think you're whole when you begin. And the love fractures you. You're whole and then you're cracked open. She was a foreign body introduced into your wholeness. And for a year and a half you struggled to incorporate it. But you'll never be whole unless you expel it. You either get rid of it or incorporate it through self-distortion. And that's what you did and what drove you mad.\" Haunted by the Pastness and the Still-Being Once again, there's a misogynist overtone to this perspective. However, it has to be assessed in the context of the last third of the novel. Just as David's self-conscious about his age, Consuela at the premature age of 32 becomes ill and for a time must confront her own mortality. As David ages, his attitude towards time has changed. This is his view at the beginning of the novel (the language both resembles and questions that of Heidegger, at least in its embrace of the past tense): \"To those not yet old, being old means you've been. But being old means that despite, in addition to, and in excess of your beenness, you still are. Your beenness is very much alive. You still are, and one is as haunted by the still-being and its fullness as by the having-already-been, by the pastness.\" In contrast, David believes that the young focus on the past as the evidence of their life and vitality. There is less concern about the future, because it's assumed that it will just happen inexorably, and that it will take and last a long time. Sailing to Byzantium Only this doesn't recognise the risk of illness. When you become ill, your perspective necessarily changes: \"Time is now how much future [you have] left, and [you don't] believe there is any.\" Until now David has always enjoyed good health and has pursued a life of absolute freedom within which he has only been accountable to his own (masculine) desire. More recently, he has known \"the sickness of desire...fastened to a dying animal\" that Yeats speaks of in a poem that gives the novel its title (see comment 1 in the thread below this review). Now David has started to experience feelings of genuine \"longing, doting, possessiveness, even of love.\" Ultimately, Consuela forces David to look at her breasts in a different way, just as she has had to. (I won't say more than this because of spoiler concerns.) David realises that his concern about his own death sometime in the unforeseeable future is nothing compared with the more immediate terror confronting Consuela because of her illness. As a result, he surrenders some of his freedom, some of his libertarianism for the sake of a better relationship. While David's perspective is undeniably male, \"The Dying Animal\" examines many Proustian concerns, only from a more overtly heterosexual point of view. That doesn't necessarily mean the novel itself is sexist or misogynistic. It's arguable that it is quite the opposite, that it is critical of the attitudes of David and George, and ultimately respectful of the women in the novel. David finally recognises that he has stood in the way of Consuela's real liberation, as well as his own. Whatever the sexual revolution might have achieved in the sixties, only when men retreat from patent selfishness and egotism will a non-sexist relationship be possible for women or men. To this extent, the novel concludes as an argument for the (sexual) liberation of women (even if it must be at the expense of men), not against it. This is often a highly stimulating and enjoyable work, if you're prepared to look and explore beyond the rudeness and lewdness of the male gaze.

it was shamelessly unputdownable. literally. i was starving and i needed to pee but i didn't put the bloody thing down until i read and digested every word. i don't even know where to start. first of all it was just a good read. well-written but not pompous - just smart. it touched upon issues which everyone finds relatable: love, sex, family life, betrayal. the plot itself was of course predictable - kind of lolita-esque, everyone knows it by heart - a man meets a woman, big age difference, a bit of passionate fucking which turns into obsession. but of course this is how it was meant to be. the actual story made up something of 10% of the novel, the rest was digressions. digressions which turned out to be not so digressive at all, if you know what i mean. one thing i loved about the book is that the narrator speaks the language of men - portraying a shameless old man who's quite chuffed abouut his long list of 20-year old lovers, who trustis his basic instincts, who accepts adultery as a part of everyday life and doesn't believe in marriage. roth employs the dicourse of masculinity but somehow translates it into the language of women, so i, being a woman, suddenly start to the read the novel as if it was more of a handbook or a genius study of male behavioural patterns. apart from all the smartness, i loved the interaction with the reader. roth's preferred reader is well-read so he does not shy away from employing intertextuality as one of the main devices. he drops in a bit of shakespeare, milton, even some of the puritan chronicles but he somehow manages to stay casual, he does not make you blush just because you haven't read 'the brothers karamazov'. he also doesn't try to be innovative in terms of style. he just writes carefully and elegantly, always uses the write amount of words and simply provides the read with an amazing piece of simple literary art. he takes you to the place where form is content. he's just so observant, he creates the most complicated characters with precission and ease, he makes them fully believable, he provides many POVs, plays with the reader and is totally convincing.i swear i could go on for ages. it's the best book i've read in a long time. ...more David \u00e9 um homem bem sucedido, conseguiu um elevado estatuto social como professor universit\u00e1rio e cr\u00edtico liter\u00e1rio na r\u00e1dio e na TV.

Has he nothing new to say? Even as my partner and I swam into ever deeper waters of discussion, my presentation of the woman's perspective, his from the side of the aging man, I had to concede that Roth has the technical skills of good writing well in hand. It takes small talent to write action; it takes skill to write about nothing, and still he moves the reader along. This does indeed read like a confession, an emotional purging, and it is done well enough, but to earn a Pulitzer, there must not only be skill, but substance as well. No prize here. If one other point is earned, I give it for title. So precise, so right, this title is a masterstroke in itself. Aside from that, spare me such men, spare me such novellas. I wish only such skill might have been used to tell more than one story, as Roth appears to have only one to tell. ...more \u0641\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0628 \u0631\u0648\u062b \u0647\u0648

After seeing the movie Elegy at our independent film series, I couldn't believe what a monster Kepish could be. I had to read the book to see what a missed......I found out that the movie followed the book very well.........Small difference, in the movie the son is a surgeon, in the book he is an art critic.... Roth is a wonderful writer.......and shows his knowledge of the arts, I learned a lot about the 60's..... even though I graduated high school then....... Kepish is an old man now... he lived his life with no commitments except to his own pleasure.............has no close friends........he rails about the cage of marriage, but seem like he is in a cage of a different type, he has his art, but no friends. ...more The Dying Animal might as well have been me reading this book.

A young Cuban love interest, a randy old professor: so much to be explored right? An interracial relationship that crosses age too. In theory this stuff should be compelling. Roth however doesn't manage to get past discussing ass-shapes and blatant Freudian castration anxiety. It's like Humbert Humbert shat himself and tried to write a passionate novel about something he didn't really care about. At no point do the characters really connect, not even through their personal fears of sex and death or through their privileged backgrounds. If sex and death can't save your dying animal of a novel, nothing can. If you have to read something this dispassionate, pick up an outdated sexist textbook for free-ninety-nine and save yourself the pain and the eight euros I was stupid enough to spend. ...more Tudo o que este tipo escreve, eu quero ler.

I pulled it out to read in anticipation of reviewing the DVD of Elegy , the film adaptation from last year. The Dying Animal is a short novel, and one that I must like in spite of myself, in spite of my often horrified reaction to the selfishness and intensity of the sexual peccadilloes of its narrator. David Kepesh is one of Roth's regular characters, and the man who turned into a giant tit in the appropriately titled The Breast , a parody of Kafka and one of the funniest things I've ever read. (Inside joke in this book being an admiration of a hand-written Kafka manuscript binding Kepesh with his fetish object.) Kepesh isn't so much an unreliable narrator as one that is both myopic and didactic regarding the myopia. His story here is one of obsession regarding his long-term existence as an unapologetic, often evangelical libertine, and the crystallization of that lifestyle in one woman, the 24-year-old Consuela Castillo, and her rather large chest. The 62-year-old Kepesh becomes so overtaken by his desire for her, it begins to threaten the cavalier lifestyle he has so meticulously constructed. What makes The Dying Animal slightly sickening to read is Kepesh's effusive recounting of his pleasures with Consuela. Talk about the male gaze, this book is one long, creepy stare! What makes me feel pangs of guilt, though, is how mesmerizing it can be, almost like Kepesh is hypnotizing me. Roth writes the book in long paragraphs, no dialogue breaks, just strings of traded conversation, and it compels the reader to move quickly through the novel, to feverishly go from page to page. The \"sex and death\" coupling is nothing new, but Roth has inextricably entwined them here in this narrative. To borrow a metaphor he uses in the book--though he relates it as the trade-off of subservience and domination that is part of any sexual encounter--it is as if he has braided the two, creating one criss-cross strand where once there was a pair (and, admittedly, a pair that began from the same source, as the hair would come from the same head). Since The Dying Animal begins with so much about youth and carnality, the switch to ruminations on the aging process and mortality is surprising. Roth even creates a counterpoint to Kepesh's remorseless pursuit of Consuela by introducing us to David's estranged son, who so hates how his father lives, he thoroughly demands the opposite of himself even when it causes him terrible misery. I think Roth is aware that there for all his belief in his own powers of observation, Kepesh is ironically unaware that the story he intends to share about Consuela is never about anyone but himself. Even in the emotional climax, where the knowledge of death prematurely comes to the young, he can't see the frightened heart beating beneath those great big breasts, he only sees the loss of his own desire. Or thinks he does, because it is also never more evident how out of control of his own life he is. I suppose this be a spoiler of sorts--so beware!--but there is a profound narrative switch on the very last page that will take some time to chew on and digest. Throughout the book, it has been made clear that Kepesh's monologue is meant to be a literal one, that he is speaking to someone directly, some invisible witness, a stand-in for the reader. In the last lines, not only does the witness speak up, but for the first time, Roth relates the call-and-response between him and Kepesh as separately rendered paragraphs (though the witness in quotes, Kepesh still not). It's a dramatic change, a last-chance grabbing at something that could be slipping away. Are we implicated now as the confidante, having read all the way to this end? Is Kepesh's obsession now our own? And how the hell can the movie of this exist without either removing some of Kepesh\u2019s beastly opinions or risk the entire audience thinking Ben Kingsley is the biggest slimeball to ever grace the silver screen? Because how can one not be more sympathetic to Penelope Cruz--particularly since in a film we will see her as something more whole than the idealized creature presented through David Kepesh\u2019s eyes? Questions I will have to answer in another review. ...more I definitely did not like this book. Not very surprising though, pretty much anyone could've told you that this just isn't a book for me. But I had to read this for school, so I didn't really have a choice. It wasn't like I hated the whole book; at times it was quite enjoyable.

Yeah, not just the protagonist, but the whole story. I'm sorry (and like I said, these kind of books aren't for me) but it just felt like such a pathetic, ridiculous and pretentious book. You have this old, white, misogynistic professor who's constantly either whining about life and how it works or he's fucking young women. But then, he ''falls in love'' with Consuela. Yeah, not really. He actually just gets obsessed with being with her and her breasts. In this book, women are only pretty objects Kepesh can use to make himself feel better, just like men are apparently bound to cheat at least once in their married lives. He's constantly saying things like ''Oh well it's in a man's nature and hey man, this is America, land of freedom, why the hell would you fuck only your wife lmao''. That's really problematic. And the book is just completely about that philosophy. It was incredibly annoying and even more boring. But I really can't get over the ridiculousness of this book. At one point, he asks Consuela to take out her tampon and watch her bleed. And then he fucking licks the blood of her thighs. I was quite disturbed. (Though the author has never probably done this himself, because menstruation blood doesn't just flow at once out of your vagina and over your legs. Seriously wtf. That's not how it works, Roth.) And Consuela always just did whatever the fuck Kepish wanted her to do. She wouldn't even say a word. She literally was his object to use. And what was even more annoying, was that Kepish was constantly thinking things like ''Consuela does this and that because she is like this and that and women always do this and that, and yes obviously I know everything about her because I'm an old white male, I know everything about the world and how it works duh <3''. Just stop please. And then Consuela leaves him and he is soooo upset and can't get his life to be normal again, because he was so obsessed with her. It's not even her personality he misses; he never speaks a word of that. It really is because of her magnificent body that it takes him three years to get over her. And even then he's still not completely over her. But then after 5 years, Consuela suddenly calls him. Because she has breast cancer. Of course she has. Everything about this book is about her breasts. So in the last 50 pages of the book, the only thing Kepish talks and thinks about are her breasts. ''Oh no, she'll lose a bit of them''. Because, as everyone knows, that's the real problem with breast cancer. Not the big chance of dying, but the surgery. Ugh. Someone get this book away from me please. ...more [\u2026] Consumami il cuore, malato di desiderio e avvinto a un animale morente, che non sa che cos\u2019\u00e8..[..] \u2013 W.B.

The most pervasive question I asked myself during the first and very tediously self-righteous 30 pages was whether or not Roth believes himself to be the heir-apparent to Norman Mailer, a comparison I've heard in passing. The primary problem being with that lofty simile is that talking about sex, your prostrate penis and waning libido like Norman Mailer does not Norman Mailer make. Mailer ostensibly placed his libido in his literature in a near self-depricating fashion where as Roth takes a poorly translated good-ol' boy romantic sentiment and creates misogynistic hyperboles without an attempt at post-modern irony. Speaking of the sexual revolution as successful is to overlook the undergirding of that 'revolution' and blithely disregard the original intent...the sexual 'revolution' was not an intention to ensure that an emaciated post-modern snob could get a good blow job, as is implied if not arguably suggested by Roth. It's all too apparent that Roth either believes he is his own main character David Kepesh, in the flesh (groan), or at the very least he certainly would like to be. Anybody championing Roth's ascention to Norman Mailer's throne as his direct progeny are likely to find themselves in a lonely camp. ...more Right after I finished this book I watched Elegy, which is a movie based on the book.

He is a professor at a major university, sets his sites on a Cuban girl in his class and begins sleeping with her. Eventually he does weird things like lick blood off of her legs. The book is a pretty self-indulgent undertaking. It is clearly just him trying to make sense of the affair and an attempt to discern why it affected him so much. I don't think he quite accomplishes that but I did end the book feeling like I'd gotten some useful insight into his own life and how it's affected a few of his other books. Overall : I would not recommend this to anyone who is just starting out with Roth. In fact, I wouldn't even recommend it to a Roth fan who hadn't read both The Professor of Desire and The Breast. ...more", "Title": "The Dying Animal"},
