Okay so I knew that I had missed something in my review pot, I just realized now that I had missed this book. But there is a Persian saying that says \"the fish is fresh whenever you catch it from the water\", so let's go with that. This book is very different,<---M> but then again it is Brandon Sanderson</---M>, so anything less would be shocking. <+++>Elantris</+++> is simply said a rather ecstatically unique book, that creates a world beyond the usual bounds of imagination that thirsts for expansion into something even grander. There are times when you think \"it doesn't get any better than this\", that is where you would be absolutely wrong. The book revolves around a young prince cursed to the immortal tragedy that is Elantris, and a young yet slightly misfit feminist princess (<---B>who I adored</---B>) . A world of Gods and grandeur that now plagued by an unknown curse is depleted of its magic and plunged into suffering. The sufferings include the inability to die and along with it the inability to heal. Where a simple bump to the arm can become an eternal pain that never leaves you, and when the pain is enough it sends you into an delirious limbo. The ideas were erratic and profound, but in the best way possible. They were daring and incredible, and that is why one must simply fall into the world of Sanderson and accept that leaving it without being marked for life is simply not an option. The book hung somewhere between high fantasy and paranormal, never quite surrendering to either. I can't really express how much I adored this book, I usually don't like overtly descriptive books, with excessive amounts of narration. I feel like these books cage the imagination, but that is simply my personal opinion.<---F> That wasn't the case here, obviously</---F>. In this book the word excessive had no place, it simply worked out in the best way possible. I hope I find time to read how the tale of Elantris will continue real soon! But 2020? What?! ...more I really enjoyed this! Didn't quite sweep me away as much as Mistborn did, but it was still a solid and satisfying read. It was rather slow in the beginning and had a good deal of build-up as the world and three main characters were introduced, but once all three story lines were thoroughly intertwined things started to get really really good!

Thank you! =) And then I look and see there are going to be more books to this series in a million years. <--Okay, not a million but still. I have to wait and read them like all the other ones I'm waiting on. Oh, and I am getting this one in the UK Edition like all the ones I love and am trying to get. So far I have the regular box set of Mistborn and the UK edition of Mistborn. I will get them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will shut-up now and talk about the book. =) I loved Raoden and Galladon. I loved Sarene and her Seon, Ashe. I just loved a lot of people in this book but those are the main ones. I even loved Hrathen and that was before he became good =) Elantris was a beautiful place with these people/gods that were silver with white hair and all the goodness and wonderfulness. Then one day it hit the fan and Elantris fell. It turned peeps into living corpses so to speak. (I'm not telling you the whole freaking story because you need to read it and plus I don't to put up my spoilers tag) The people of Arelon left Elantris alone but exiled people in the kingdom to Elantris that would get this disease. I loved these parts. Not what happened to the people but the things that were going on in Elantris, the whole freaking story about it Raoden is the prince of Arelon and his father who is the king is a big jerk! Anyway, Raoden is to be married to Sarene but when she gets there they tell her that the prince has died. Well, that sucked right? Sarene stayed in Arelon to try to make things better and stir things up. Oh how I loved her. She was teaching ladies to fence and she she was just a smart, strong woman. And she his this little thing called a seon and this one is named Ashe. They talk to each other and are always together unless she sends Ashe off on an errand. Hrathen is a high priest who comes to town trying to convert everyone. He's a huge scary looking dude apparently. Or a gyorn as he was called. He was having trouble every step of the way from Sarene and one of his own and even Raoden. But he seemed to always be on the fence about things. There is so much in this book that I would like to talk about. There is just so much. I must say the parts I did enjoy the most were with Raoden. Where he was at, what he was doing what he became. And the last paragraph of the book brought a tear to my eye. MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List ...more Oh, Elantris, why must you torture me so?

Why must you force me into conflict with the library, my favorite supplier? They claim I owe them, and they aren't going to leave me alone. I'm afraid to go to the corner dropbox at night in case a librarian is lurking. I've stubbornly held onto their copy of Elantris hoping that I would become inspired to re-read and provide a more thorough review. Alas, no. You will have to read my generalized dislike instead of many specific examples. For no clear reason, I was completely unable to sustain interest in Elantris despite leaving the library copy on my physical 'currently reading' shelf for months. While there is an interesting vision of a magical system, magic isn't enough to save the story, especially as the re-discovering of Elantrian magic is so slooow in the making. Out of the triplicate storyline, the destroyed Elantrian city was the only plot that really sustained my focus. Perhaps part of it was a difficulty connecting with any of the characters who were mostly out of the Campbellian Mythical Archetype lineage. Prince Raoden has been declared dead, but has actually been thrown into slime-coated Elantris. He has undergone the random but incomplete transformation into an Elantrian. However, he brings his royal training, knowledge of various Arelon citizens and unflagging optimism to the destroyed city and starts gathering the hopeless citizens into a band of survivors. He has a vision-- plans to forge them into a populace with pride . He is going to scrub the slime from the buildings and recognize that even the street-sweepers have value in society. He's going to study, at least the books that haven't been eaten by the starving populace. He's going to make friends with a Jamaican friend and adviser, Galladon. He's going to fix things. A second storyline is focused an an annoyingly plucky young heroine, Sarene (subtle much?) --saved from being a Mary Sue because, you know, she can't draw . Or sing. I think. She's been betrothed to the prince of Arelon as part of an alliance between her kingdom and his. She faces somewhat predictable kingdom politics, as well as--gasp--overt sexism from her father-in-law and the generally patriarchal Arelon society. But don't worry--she'll modernize them and teach them that real princess can fight using swords. The final storyline is focused on Hrathen, a high priest from Fjordell who is in a mission to convert the godless in Arelon before his emperor invades. He's actually one of the most layered characters because he has the zeal of a believer tempered with flawed insight. Though he thinks he knows the politics, he's frequently outmaneuvered by everyone around him, from Sarene, to his recruit, to the emperor. However, the subtlety of his characterization is based on overly-fuzzy political details, so there is a tremendous amount of info-dumping whenever he is in a scene, likely one reason a number of readers label it their least favorite storyline. I just didn't feel the heart here, ultimately leading it to a two star read for me. It felt a little too self-conscious and 'I'm-avoiding-formula-by-changing-two-things' on Sanderson's part. There are a couple of unsolved questions, at least as far as my half-a-brain effort could tell, but I'm not sure there's anything worth potential conflict with the library. After all, I have to stay on the good side of my dealer.

I think I've wished for half-stars maybe three times, at the outside, in the years I've been on Goodreads. Generally, though I may waffle between stars for a little while, I can settle on a rating which I feel accurately represents my feelings about the book in a... mostly unemotional manner. (All my ratings are to some extent emotionally based; I am, after all, not a computer.) However, when it comes to Brandon Sanderson books I'm simply so biased that this system doesn't work for me. I'm not sure half stars would help, actually. What I really need is a system that breaks the book down into qualities like 'writing style' and 'plot coherency' which I can then rate out of ten because, considering them separately, I could probably manage more objectivity. This system would then spit out a rating based on the average of the subcategories, which would likely be lower by at least a star than my shiny emotional-first-reaction five stars up there. Since this system has yet to be created, let alone implemented, the five stars will stay. Take them with a grain of salt; the book is not perfect, but I honestly do not care. And now, after two preambles, we bring you the main event: an actual review of the book, and not just Anila's abstract feelings about it and the rating system. We'll start with the bad, because it's the smallest section. Like most first novels, Elantris suffers from some predictable problems. Sanderson's prose is rockier here than I'm used to - I've noticed over time that, logically enough, it becomes more polished with each new work, so of course this would be the roughest of them all. The two main characters, Raoden and Sarene, feel like prototypes of the characters he's put in his later work: they're larger-than-life and slightly messy combinations of the virtues and flaws that he's since separated out to make more realistic, tidier characters. Here we see the seeds of Kelsier's leadership and idealism, Vin's cynicism, Elend's bookishness, Jasnah's keen intelligence and sharp attitude. As is to be expected, all those qualities are powerful when used in moderation in other characters; here, they feel a little bit exaggerated and unlikely, particularly in Raoden. Speaking of Raoden - I love him, really (more on this later) but some aspects of his character felt a weeeeee bit deus ex machina. (view spoiler) [His unexplained 'affinity' for the Aons being the big one, of course. (hide spoiler) ] With characters like this, it comes as no surprise that scenes of conflict are underwhelming: not only are our heroes almost absurdly full of virtues, they're also extraordinarily talented and powerful in many areas. Everyone else is sort of dim next to them, and so any confrontation doesn't last long and no one really puts up a fight. It's hard to be invested in the tension of a scene or feel emotions at success when the ending was a foregone conclusion. ...I think that's all the bad stuff. Excellent. Let's move on to the meat of this review: things I love without shame or moderation . 1. The concept. And not just the whole 'Eternity ended ten years ago' thing even though wow, what a killer tagline, am I right? No, what appealed to me most was the way Elantrians - now cursed - changed their natures to suit the situation. What they are has forced them to adopt or lose their minds to neverending pain, and it's really fascinating. \"On the outside, people tend to be convinced of their own immortality. We are more realistic. One rarely wins a battle without at least a few wounds, and here even a couple of slight cuts can be more devastating, and more agonizing, than a swift decapitation.\" This is most interesting, I think, for its contrast to conventional fantasy. Usually in a fantasy novel there will be someone who can heal with a touch or a spell or a potion; failing that there are herbalists, doctors, sometimes even surgeons. The Elantrians, however, have none of the above nor the resources they would require to be effective - and on top of that, even if they did, their wounds would still never heal. The way this changes their interactions varies depending on the situation, but in general creates a world where only the half-mad actually fight other people. One injury too many means a fate worse than death; it could turn a previously sane man or woman into a listless broken wreck who can do nothing more than chant a mantra of their greatest regrets over and over and over again. This is really astounding, in a worldbuilding sense, and forces what might otherwise have been a violence-centric story to become one of diplomacy and negotiation. It's also all the more painful when people are injured, as does happen from time to time, because the reader knows what they are suffering and that they have lost the last shred of their humanity, but will be forced to live on without it. 2. Raoden. I have... feelings about Raoden. The truth is, I sorta adore all the male characters Brandon Sanderson creates. Raoden, however, is the only one I want to pluck out of the book and mash faces with. (view spoiler) [(If Kelsier were real, he and I would be at loggerheads over the whole 'wiping out a group of people because of circumstances beyond their control' thing, and as for Elend, well, would you dare to steal Vin's man? No, thought not. Kaladin is too good for me, and also belongs right in that book where he already is, thank you very much, so I can have more wonderful exploits and badassery to read about.) (hide spoiler) ] which is not really a spoiler but actually a tangent. Raoden started worming his way into my heart on page 51. How? \"Books!\" Raoden said with excitement. Open note to all authors: any character who reacts exuberantly to the presence of books will start out in my good graces. If it's your love interest, well... bonus points are an understatement. Enthusiasm for books and enthusiasm for whales are two hugely appealing things to me. Anyhow, that's really just the beginning. Raoden is the kind of character who, like Kaladin, would be the center of a lot of montage scenes if this book were made into a movie. He's one of those leader types who goes in and gathers people who all love him and help him work towards a goal and they're successful and it's beautiful and deep down inside you know it can't last because the montage is just leading up to the big emotional moment when everything goes south, but you really really really want them to just do everything right and live long happy lives in the paradise they've created for themselves. I love montage scenes, and I love the people who orchestrate them, and really this is kind of pathetic but one of the easiest ways for a character to become sympathetic and engaging is for them to participate in one. Trufax. There's also the fact that not only is Raoden enthusiastic about books, he recognizes their value as a resource and uses them to solve problems . Words cannot express how many characters in how many books could have fixed their shit right up if they would just go the fuck to the library , or the nearest comparable resource. (I include older, more knowledgeable characters in 'resources', by the way. Seriously, guys, sometimes adults really do know something important. Talk to them. It bears noting that this is only a little bit of a tangent and not actually off-topic, because Raoden makes a point of learning from other characters. WUT.) Raoden manages to figure out a great deal about Elantris and what caused its problems by careful research and logical deduction. (view spoiler) [I do agree with the assertion that he comes by this deduction rather too easily, the same way that he gets a nebulous 'affinity' for Aons rather too easily. Buuuut... whatever. And anyhow, the primary tidbit of information that enables him to solve the riddle - that the basic Aon represents the major geographic features of the land - comes from someone else, so that gives him a little more leeway in my eyes. (hide spoiler) ] Umm. There will be more (spoilery) fangirling over Raoden later. Yes, in a whole other subsection. This is what I mean by feelings . 3. Sarene. ...a lanky, brusque woman who was almost past her prime. Sarene is not my favorite of Sanderson's female characters. That would be Jasnah Kholin, always and forever. She is also not the most well-rounded or well-developed character in this book, and she has a lot of habits and characteristics that annoyed me. A lot of them annoyed me, though, because I see them in myself. Personal digression in spoilers; has nothing to do with plot: (view spoiler) [I'm eighteen and I've never once been asked out, let alone kissed. To my knowledge, no one has ever had a crush on me. I don't know why, and I'm not sure I would want to, because in general I really like who I am, but sometimes (especially when I'm talking with friends my age who have steady boyfriends or, even worse, change boys frequently) I'm struck by a feeling of missingness . Something is absent. I form perfectly wonderful emotional connections with other people, and I have friends that I love like siblings or better, but the physical aspect is just - not there. It's not something I worry about all the time, not by a long shot. I'm not a particularly physical person; I don't wish I had a significant other so I could jump their bones. But it would be nice to have someone I felt that comfortable with in that way - someone who I could walk with holding hands, or whose shoulder I could rest my head on, or whose cheek I could kiss in just a casual, natural, affirmative way. I miss that, as much as anyone can miss something they've never had, and so I understand how Sarene feels so very, very well. The longing that she feels for that kind of emotional connection may be annoying to some readers, but to me it feels intensely real. (hide spoiler) ] Ummm. It's a little hard to re-ground myself after that. Sorry. Anyhow, Sarene. Yes. Sarene is a pistol . I admired her spunk (for lack of a better word) from the get-go: she finds herself in a country not her own, legally married and obligated to mourn for a dead man she never met, frustrated by a king who thinks women are for decoration and court ladies who act as if he's right. And of course, as soon as she decides that the kingdom of Arelon is in trouble, she does everything in her power to help it, even though she owes it no obligation. Interestingly enough, she doesn't really do it out of pure selflessness. She had spent nearly three decades loving a country without ever feeling it loved her back. Teod had respected her, but she was tired of respect. She wanted something different from Arelon. Sarene is, I think, the second most flawed character in this book. She wants to do good, yes, but that's because she wants the affirmation she thinks she'll get from others. And the real kicker is: she doesn't know how to do the right thing . It's a sharp (and sometimes unfortunate) contrast with Raoden, who seems to come upon the exact right decision by constant good fortune to the point that it gets kinda annoying. Sarene, on the other hand, doesn't always have a complete picture of the situation and so she does what she perceives to be best at the time - which isn't always what's best in the bigger picture. This, of course, leads to some not-so-positive results, which is how it should be: flawed characters make mistakes and suffer for it and then they get better. I like that Sarene does this. I don't like that her mistakes are more frequent and more directly commented upon than Raoden's. (view spoiler) [His biggest one, in shoving her out of the city through the front gates after Hrathen's potion wears off, really really bothers me because he never even stopped to think about it, especially since it came right after she explained Hrathen's campaign to get Arelon to convert. Actually, I kind of blame Raoden for the whole Eventeo-converts-to-Shu-Dorath thing, because if he'd taken a moment to consider everything that had happened, he probably would have kept Sarene hidden and devised a better strategy. This would be better if it were addressed as a mistake, but... it wasn't. So it niggles at me. (hide spoiler) ] The final word on Sarene, though, is still 'awesome'. She's smart, well-meaning, emotionally believable, and willing to kick ass when it's necessary. 4. Hrathen. He just fascinated me. Actually, as I think about it, I feel that a lot of the reasons that I liked Hrathen were the reasons Inspector Javert is my favorite character in Les Miserables, because they are both noble people doing bad things for all the right reasons, and with little malice in their hearts. I also loved, loved, loved Hrathen's religious conflict, and the way he struggled to balance what he felt his duty as a gyorn was with what he felt was right. He's got a lot of baggage from doing something purely from duty, and I felt that it affected his actions in Arelon to a real and nuanced degree. It didn't matter that he had acted in the name of the Church, or that he had saved thousands upon thousands of souls. The destruction Hrathen had caused in Duladel ground against his soul like a millstone. People who had trusted him were dead, and an entire society had been cast into chaos. Though at his introduction I'd expected Hrathen to become the villain of the novel, I was quickly sure that this was not the case. Far be it from the eminently skilled Mr. Sanderson careful Anila your fangirl is showing to create a wholly unsympathetic villain, but even so the degree of attention he paid to Hrathen's conflicts elevated him fairly clearly to, if not protagonist level, at least secondary character on the 'good' side. I don't feel that's too much of a spoiler, since it becomes evident relatively early. (view spoiler) [My one reservation is what happens with Hrathen at the very end. I liked his actions, and that he turned away from the strict doctrines of Shu-Doreth to do what he felt was right, but I felt that decision was somewhat marred - nay, tainted - by the brief narrative comment explaining that he had been in love with Sarene. Umm... what? First of all, there was very little basis for real love between them. Mutual respect, yes; romantic love, no. (In Homestuck parlance, I'd say that they could have been morails or even kismeses at certain points but never matesprits.) It also felt a little unrealistic given Sarene's previous romantic experience - if she'd gone her whole life finding no man who believed himself in love with her, the idea that two would show up in such short succession is a bit preposterous. (hide spoiler) ] 5. Religion. It's always a theme in Sanderson's books, and one that he includes on purpose, which I think is really quite fascinating. Because I've been aware of it as a theme since before I read Warbreaker , so I pay special attention to it. As always, it shines. There's not much to say about the way he handles it, actually, that I haven't raved about in other reviews - particularly for The Well of Ascension - but I do want to mention that even though the religions here feel somewhat more derivative than I'm accustomed to from Sanderson - the schism between Shu-Dorath and Shu-Korath is painfully close to Islam and Christianity - I still found it to be handled tastefully. Now, I'm not religious myself so someone who is might be annoyed at things that I didn't notice, but I feel it bears noting that I, as an atheist, found the religions to be a believably central part of the world without feeling that I was being preached at, which is often a delicate balance and one that few authors even attempt to address as directly, if they do so at all. There are a few quotes regarding religion that I really, really loved: \"Keseg taught of unity. But what did he mean? Unity of mind, as my people assume? Unity of love, as your priests claim? Or is it the unity of obedience, as the Derethi believe? In the end, I am left to ponder how mankind managed to complicate such a simple concept.\" This one stood out to me because it's something I can really sympathize with. Even as an atheist, there's a lot of things about religions that I like - usually those that have to do with it as a social/moralizing force. It feels like Shuden is speaking for me when he comments sadly on the overcomplication of simple, positive ideas. \"Everything happens according to Domi's will, child,\" Omin answered. \"However, I do not think that 'curse' is the right word. At times, Domi sees fit to send disasters upon the world; other times he gives the most innocent of children a deadly disease. These are no more curses than what happened to Elantris - they are simply the workings of the world. All things must progress, and progression is not always a steady incline. Sometimes we must fall, sometimes we will rise - some must be hurt while others have fortune, for that is the only way we can learn to rely on one another. As one is blessed, it is his privilege to help those whose lives are not as easy. Unity comes from strife, child.\" Have you ever noticed how no one, ever, wants to answer one key question? I refer, of course, to the common query of the atheist: if a benevolent god exists, why is there so much evil in the world? To which most people will respond with vagaries about 'free will' and 'mysterious ways' and actually not answer the question in a satisfactory manner. Now, I have my issues with this explanation, but not only is it perfectly in-character, at least Sanderson made the effort . That really counts for something. I may not be rushing out to convert after such blinding and faultless logic, but I'm glad to know there are people out there who have put enough thought into their faith to be able to answer such an essential question. continued in comments because character limits.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Elantris is the first novel by Brandon Sanderson.

This book has focused on religious and politics. Raoden and Kaladin are reminiscent but they are different because Raoden is more omnipotent. Kaladin is more victim. Raoden is what Kaladin would have been like if he was born to a more powerful family and Kaladin is what Raoden would have been like if he was born to a less powerful family. My favourite characters are Raoden and Hrathen. I find Hrathen intrigues than rest of the characters because his character is more complex. I have noticed lots of people gave lower rated of this book. Most of them are like me read books by Brandon Sanderson before Elantris like Mistborn or Stormlight Archive, they are very popular and they like it so I think these people who have gave lower rated of this book have a high expectation towards Elantris.

That said I fully recommend this book as your first venture into Brandon Sanderson's work if you are at all interested in fantasy or just want an entertaining read without the 'literary baggage'. The strengths of this book are in the plot (discussed more deeply in my first review) and the depth of the novel. Brandon Sanderson manages to combat a lot of criticisms of modern fantasy in this work by concluding an entire story in one volume and while a lot of his later books have been called shallow fun with readable, yet not brilliant writing, this book is probably his deepest, philosophically. I would love to read a feminist review of the book (and one that did not simply question things like 'are the characters Mary Sues - because frankly I hate the term and fine most characters in some ways have unique qualities that make them interesting regardless) or a review looking at the religious system built into the novel. What I myself find most interesting however is how it looks at pain and despair. Elantris is a modern version of Atlantis in many ways with Sanderson referencing that myth nicely. Although his version is nowhere near as good as that by J.R.R Tolkien. In his version however, rather than showing a race of people drowned, he uses the idea of a sickness. Another idea it appears to reference is the fall of man as seen theologically in Genesis. This sickness is a curse that brings with it pain, despair and alienation. It is how this 'sickness' is treated that I find fascinating in this book. It reminds me of how the X-Men are treated by humans in the comics and how humans have treated each other in slavery. And yet, the main idea running through this book is that we do not have to be defined by our conditions, that we are only defeated if we let our conditions get to us mentally. This is the idea of contrasting sickness and health, freedom and slavery and alienation and acceptance as only defeating you if you accept them with your mind. A fine, entertaining book and one with some interesting and relevant themes. There are better books like Les Mis\u00e9rables however not everyone will read those books. I hope instead that people can find the themes in those great books in good books like this one. Review number 1 The premise: a blessing that turned men into gods became a curse that turns men into the undead without a heartbeat and with skin that shrivels in place of the silver skin and hair they possessed before. What follows is one man's quest to discover how and why the curse happened and hence why he has been thrown into Elantris. Where before the curse he would have been immortal and free of all pain he remains immortal but with a body which no longer heals itself. The pain builds up and up until eventually those cursed snap. In the midst of this plot a religious conflict exists as one man tries to convert an entire city to his religion and prevent war. A princes also strives to work out what happened to her promised husband while trying to fix politics within the city bordering Elantris. Sound confusing? Well Brandon Sanderson manages to pull together all these conflicting elements, spinning a web of intrigue and magic so dense it's hard not to be drawn into the world formed by his words. Its very easy reading this to see why he was chosen to complete Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series because he is a superbly brilliant writer of fantasy. The story explores incredible themes like rejection, political intrigue, religious extremity, bigotry, xenophobia and a load more. And the story is easy to pick up and read from beginning to end. Trust me this is a book that must be read in order to appreciate the wonders of the fantasy genre. Not all will enjoy this as much as I did. As a debut novel it does exhibit several typical aspects of other debuts. For instance a tendency to over-word is prevalent. Still it is a finely told story despite any flaws and that is why I loved it as much as I did. If you want to read a city based fantasy that focuses on political intrigue, religion and the idea of what pain will do to people then read this book. Appendices: 1.

The world-building, especially the set up of 2 religions warring for the hearts and minds of a people with the ruins of a fallen utopia in the background, was awesome and the characters were overall pretty likeable and occasionally intriguing. This is my first Sanderson book so I'm definitely psyched to see how he develops his craft from this strong debut. The setting in this book was pretty strong. The specter of a fallen utopia in the background of a thriving city was a really striking image, although I found it kind of eye-roll inducing that the Elantrians (the race of magic people that inhabited the old city) were seemingly perfect in every way before being undone by chance. I know this is fantasy but it was still unbelievable. My favourite part of the world-building by far was the conflict between 2 schools of religious thought, and how that conflict motivated schemes, warfare and bloodshed around the world. This was explored particularly well in Hrathen's sections. A complaint I did have about the world-building was how a once sophisticated society that was pretty much a magical utopia turned almost instantly into a feudal-style society with clearly defined social positions (serf, lord) and how this society was shown in a really clumsy way to be evil and inefficient (when kind-hearted princess and MC Sarene rolls in, frees the peasants and everyone is so happy that productivity skyrockets). The story is told through the POV of 3 main characters: Raoden, Sarene and Hrathen. Raoden is a former prince thrown into the zombie infested ruins of Elantris. Only instead of eating brains and doing cool zombie stuff most of the zombies sit around complaining about how sad/hungry they are. Instead of doing the right thing and going all Dead Rising (i.e. getting a skateboard and riding through clumps of zombies, somehow killing them while remaining unharmed. Dang, that game was awesome I should really re-play it) on their zombie asses he tries to lead the emo-zombies into forming a hippie commune. Raoden's were probably my least favourite sections. The lack of interesting stuff going on and initially slow pace was compounded by the constant references to how the residents of Elantris were constantly on the brink of going mad from hunger/pain. It really killed my vibe. The highlight of Raoden's parts were undoubtedly his attempts to unravel the mystery of how Elantris fell. These sections posed an interesting mystery and had an awesome payout at the end of the book. Sarene was at times a pretty boring character. Much like Raoden she often came across as a pretty bland protagonist, however unlike Raoden she was at least doing interesting stuff. Her attempts to being down a corrupt monarchy were interesting and her ongoing battle of wits with Hrathen, as she tried to stop the spread of his violent religion, made for some really interesting conflict. Hrathen for me was by far the most interesting of the main POV characters. A priest of the Derethi (bad guys) religion he aims to convert the people in a desperate attempt to avoid a bloody conflict between the 2 religions. Throughout the story Hrathen is shown to be both a badass warrior and a subtle political operative, however my favourite part of his arc was his attempts to work through a crisis of faith and justify his often horrific actions through a mixture religion and logic. The plot of this book was pretty meandering and some parts seemed to go very slowly (this was especially true of many of Raoden's parts and a few of Sarene's) however the ending more than made up for it and managed to raise this book from a 3/3.5 star rating to a solid 4. Without going into any spoilers a load of the plotlines that were set up throughout the book and the storylines of most of the characters converged in an epic action packed finale that was Erikson-esque in it's intensity. (view spoiler) [ Raoden finally being able to cleanse the Dor and open up a can of whoop-ass on the Derethi demon-monks was easily the most fist pump inducing moment of the book to that point and almost enough to single-handedly make up for how boring the rest of his arc was. Hrathen's ultimate decision to turn against the religion he increasingly viewed as evil and brutal was also a great (and appropriate) ending to his storyline while his slaying of the fanatical (and evil as fuck) head priest was an extremely close second to Raoden's earlier moment of awesomeness. Hrathen's final thoughts: Lamenting that he never got the chance to tell Sarene, his rival throughout the book, that he loved her combined with the memorial erected to him were by far the most moving moments of the book. (hide spoiler) ] Overall this was a strong debut and a good read in it's own right. I've heard that Sanderson's stuff only gets better from here so I'm definitely interested to check it out. ...more On sale today for 2.99 here this is Sandersons first published work and it sparks of originality.

I spent thirty minutes trying to explain this book to my husband and son. Why it was cool and all the stuff I liked about it such as a zombie city with intelligent life, a marriage of two people who have never met in person and one of whom is assumed dead, a religious zealot that made my skin crawl, silvery orbs that have a sentient being in them that act as a type of google/skype hybrid, political intrigue, pending doom etc, etc\u2026.and I failed miserably all I got from them was\u2026. I\u2019m not even sure that the book\u2019s description does it justice and I may fail here as well but I will give it a shot. This is shown from the perspectives of three different PoVs; Raoden the Prince of Arelon, Sarene the Teoish princess he was supposed to marry and Hrathen a priest from Fjorden sent to convert the people of Arelon. I like this style of storytelling because of the larger picture you see when it is from all the different angles. The story: \u201cThe Shaod, it was called. The Transformation... When it came, the fortunate person's life ended and began anew; he would discard his old, mundane existence and move to Elantris. Elantris, where he could live in bliss, rule in wisdom, and be worshiped for eternity. Eternity ended ten years ago.\u201d Now Elantris is a city that is full of walking corpses. Some still have their minds but many have given into the pain and despair and become nothing more than muttering lumps on the side of the streets. Everything is dirty and broken. The city that was once beautiful and full of God like beings with magical powers is now just a shell of what it once was. Raoden was the Prince of Arelon before the Shaod took him and his heart stopped beating. Now he is a walking corpse in Elantris too, but he thinks that maybe he can find a way to make life in Elantris a little better than it is now. \u201dWe\u2019re dead, sule,\u201d Galladon said. \u201cWhat purpose can we have besides suffering?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the problem. Everyone\u2019s convinced that their lives are over just because their hearts stopped beating.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s usually a pretty good indication, sule,\u201d Sarene, is a spinster by Teosh standards. She is twenty five and without much hope of finding a husband in Teod she agreed to an arranged marriage with Raoden. They have never met, only corresponded through letters and Seons (that is the silvery google/skype floating balls thingy), but she had hopes that one day it could be more than just a political arrangement. However, when she gets to Arelon she finds that the man she was supposed to marry has died and according to the terms of the marriage contract she is officially married to a man she never met. To save her homeland she will need to play some political games and find some allies in her new home. \u201cThe problem with being clever, Serene thought with a sigh, is that everyone assumes you're always planning something.\u201d Finally there is Hrathen the high priest or gyorn in his religion. Sent by his god he has three months to convert the people of Arelon to Jaddeth or his god will conquer the city and none will survive. He caused a serious revolution in another country he tried to convert and hopes to avoid the mistakes he made in the past. This story is where it all begins. The thing I find hard about rating this book is that I have read other Brandon Sanderson (BS) books and so I know how much better his writing is going to get. BS is a fantastic story teller. His characters are complex and imperfect. The heroes have doubts and moments of weakness, the adversaries have good qualities and solid motivations for their actions as well. This is the first book he had published, his characters are still all these things but not as developed as in later works. The magic system created and the political ones are always different and well plotted out. There is a minor discrepancy in this one but it didn\u2019t take away from the overall story me. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. I loved Jumping from Raoden\u2019s chapters that where more action to Sarene\u2019s that are more political intrigue and plotting. I held on hoping and waiting for the two to meet and loved the almost Beauty and the Beast aspect of their initial meeting. Hrathen\u2019s chapters were insightful and disturbing; he went through a lot of planning and misdirection in his zeal to convert the kingdom. BS always creates strong female characters. Sarene is witty and fun. She speaks her mind and can play the political game well, even when she isn\u2019t sure what she is playing at. One thing was clear, however. If the gyorn saw reason to preach against Elantris, then it was her duty to defend it. It was possible to block her enemy's schemes before she fully understood them. Since this is the first book he published it isn\u2019t as polished as his later works and I will say that I knew how the overall ending would work out early on even though I didn\u2019t see the twists and turns to get there. In his later works you have no idea how things are going to work out in the end. BS has really grown a lot in his writing since this novel. If you have never read anything by Brandon Sanderson I\u2019m not sure that this is the book to start with. I say that only because he is one of my favorite Fantasy authors and I don\u2019t want there to be any confusion on how great a writer he is. This is a novel in a greater collection of 36 novels called the cosmos but\u2026.DO NOT let that deter you. It reads great as a stand-alone novel as well. If you have never read another Sanderson book I recommend The Mistborn Series (because the first trilogy is complete) or the Stormlight Archives, The Way of Kings and Words of Radiance (because they are my absolute favorites). But if you have already read those pick this up, it is still a great story and you can see just how far BS has come. ...more Not as good as Mistborn, but still wonderful.

After pages and pages of unconditional belief, strong character and passion for logic? He went good because HE LOVED HER? Cheap trick. (hide spoiler) ] . Raoden, the special snowflake that after ten years of elantrian ignorance came to Elantris to discover the cause of Elantris's fall ALL BY HIMSELF, was too perfect in my opinion but I did found his friendship with Galladon very entertaining so I didn't dislike him at all. There's no way to save Sarene, though. Sanderson builds this character over what others will say about her but he won't show us. Sarene's good at everything: syre fencing, politics, religion, she's clever and beautiful. She's so clever and beautiful, that nobody wants to marry her, I know that because she moans about that 50% of the book. I find it funny that she went on a humanitary mission to Elantris but after Raoden asked her for clothes and buckets among other things, she delivers broken and faulty things to sick, suffering people! However, Sanderson always has strong secondary characters who are completely adorable and their lost is always painful. (view spoiler) [This is a Mistborn spoiler!

The social structure, intrigue and betrayal, some unexpected revelations and of course, Elantris itself, are some of the reasons to read this book if you don't mind the length and weak points.

Toda la historia girara en torno a estos 3 personajes en una serie de tramas donde descubriremos que paso con Elantris y sus habitantes, como se forja una lucha interna pol\u00edtica en el reino de Arelon y como poco a poco se empieza a instaurar un lucha religiosa. Es una historia compleja, con varios personajes y t\u00e9rminos propios, con un sistema m\u00e1gico propio que vamos conociendo poco a poco; pero que en ning\u00fan momento se llega hacer pesada ni liosa dada la capacidad de Brandon Sanderson para producir una inmersi\u00f3n poco a poco en la historia, donde todo te acaba pareciendo completamente normal, como si de toda la vida hubieras sabido que exist\u00edan los aones (solo lo entender\u00e1n los que leyeron el libro xD).

Because I seriously doubt I'd be picking up his other books anytime soon after finishing Elantris . My biggest issue with this book is its main characters. I'm willing to turn a blind eye on Deus ex machinas lurking around every corner, plot holes, unresolved questions, incredibly boring dialogues and witless conversations (which probably makes up more than 90% of the book). No, all of these factors combined couldn't be as disappointing as the main characters. Sarene, the heroine, the-most-perfect-and-intelligent-princess-that-ever-walked-the-earth is the chief reason why I felt like puking most of the time while reading this. BS and just about every character in the book would have you believe that she is the most awesomest thing ever: she's intelligent, beautiful, she has a great mind for politics, religion, she is a master swordsman. In short, she's perfect, you see. But nothing that ever comes out of this girls mouth is remotely interesting, intelligent or funny. On the contrary she is very annoying, insecure, haughty and stupid 99% of times. None of the 'clever' solutions she offers in the book ever does anyone any good. She repeatedly makes very foolish decisions. Yet everyone is ever in awe of her. You will read about how intelligent and amazing she is at least once in every page. Though basically all she ever does is be bitter about this or that, act like an old spinster even though she is only 25 year old or whine about how, how men don't want to marry her because of her intellect. SNORT. One of the other main characters, Prince Raoden is without a doubt the biggest Gary Sue Sanderson has ever created. And he is a very boring one at that. He is so boring that I'm not even going to criticize him because even trying to think and write something about that guy is extremely boring. Just think of a hero that is perfect, wealthy, lucky, smart, good, talanted and never dies in the book. That is Raoden. Raoden is the Solver of the mysteries, savior of the Elantrians, defender of the weak. Raoden is the fair and beloved prince of Arelon. Raoden is all that is good and fair. Raoden is the walking and talking definition of being boring. Hrathen, on the other hand, is the only truly interesting and fully fleshed out character in Elantris. His storyline had the potential to save this book. (view spoiler) [ But instead Sanderson chose to sacrifice him and go for cheap romance. Pity. I wish Raoden and Sarene were dead instead of Hrathen. (hide spoiler) ] One of the very few interesting things about this book was Elantris. The mystery of it. So despite the painful stupidity of the characters, I gritted my teeth and embraced myself for biggest revelation. What I got instead was a poorly explained (or was it even explained at all?) mystery, a plot that heavily relied on Deus ex machinas and the most underwhelming and anti-climatic ending ever. And don't even get me started on endless dialogs that were obviously meant to be humorous and witty but instead came off as excruciatingly boring and didn't even have an ounce of humor or intelligence. P.S Sanderson's descriptions of food and clothes in this book can put even GRRM to shame. ...more Just over 10 years ago, a pretty much unknown author published his fantasy debut, sold 400 copies in the first week and panicked thinking it was a failure.

Fast forward to early 2016; Brandon Sanderson has published another 17 of his own books and 7 novellas/short stories (garnering an average rating of 4.36 in Goodreads), completed The Wheel of Time, and been repeatedly touted to be one of the most prolific authors of this generation, with worldbuilding ideas that almost defies comprehension at times. Elantris was Sanderson\u2019s first published novel and it still represented one of the most original works I\u2019ve read to-date. It was not flawless given its uneven pacing, and neither was it grand nor epic. While Sanderson was subsequently known to write amazing action scenes, Elantris was instead a more personal and contemplative story of devotion and dominion. As Cosmere fans will know which Shards exist in the world of Sel, it was thematically very appropriate. There were little in the way of action scenes and of the magic system at work, except during the climax, but this did not stop me from being interested in the story. It is by no means a spoiler, I believe, to say that the fall of Elantris was linked to the failure of the magic pervading the city and it was up to the main protagonist, Prince Raoden, to figure out what, why and how. With this, the very explanation of how the magic of Elantris works served as the mystery component underlying this tale. Humanity and faith, hope and purpose, power and greed - these are relevant key aspects of life (fantasy or otherwise) which Sanderson deftly wove into this book which stands well as a single-volume, which in itself is a rare occurrence in the modern fantasy genre. The main characters in this book have also been touted to be flat and clich\u00e9d, especially Raoden and Sarene. While they definitely do not have the complexities of some of Sanderson\u2019s characters in the Mistborn and Stormlight series, I have no complaints and personally find that Raoden and Sarene carried the story of Elantris well. As far as the main POVs go, Hathren was clearly, and by popular consensus, the more interesting character. The theme of devotion and dominion was most obviously dealt with in his arc. One point to note is that I completed this reread via 2 mediums \u2013 the Graphic Audio supplemented by the paperback version of the Tenth Anniversary Author\u2019s Definitive Edition. The new and improved maps, an expanded Ars Arcanum, a special extra scene of this edition make the additional purchase worthwhile. The addition of a foreword by Dan Wells and postscript by Sanderson was also very much welcomed. The superb casting of the Graphic Audio ensemble brought out all the characters really well and I believe that went a long way in enlivening the characterisation which was regularly criticised. This then comes to my point of view \u2013 if the material is great enough to produce such a wonderfully immersive experience with the right casting and interpretation, is it really the fault of the author that the characterisation failed to shine in the minds of its readers? I am upgrading Elantris to 5-stars. ---------------------------------------------- Mar 2016: Reread alongside Graphic Audio Been meaning to re-read this after I've bought the 10th anniversary edition. The main impetus now came in the form of Graphic Audio which I've discovered when Brandon announced that The Stormlight Archive is being adapted into this amazing movie-like storytelling format. ...more Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar kurban olsun sana be!

But I'm getting ahead of myself, let me tell the story from the beginning: My last semester at BYU I took a How To Write Sci-Fi/Fantasy class as a relaxing, fun, end-of-college class to balance out all the yucky quantum physics. The professor was none other than Brandon Sanderson, who had just had his book, Elantris, accepted for publication. Needless to say, the class was a blast, and Professor Sanderson really left a positive impression on me. I had forgotten all about his book until, much later, I was killing time in an airport book store while on layover, and was quite surprised to stumble across this book! I would normally almost never buy a new hardcover book, starving student and all that, but I had to make an exception in this case! I paid the hefty $25 or $30 or whatever it was and began to read. Here's what I thought: I was pleasantly surprised. Remember, this is Mr. Sanderson's first work to be published. What struck me was that, not only did this book immerse the reader into the fantasy world quite effectively, but that fantasy world was markedly unique and interesting. Any fantasy book that can stray significantly from the, um, shall we say, \"typical\" scene, is a success to some degree, and this one pulls it off marvelously. This book reads differently from the typical fantasy story in a lot of ways. My favorite aspect is probably how the protagonist struggles, not with sword and sorcery, or (in the case of Tad Williams) by simply bumbling along and just showing up, but rather with his mind, willpower, and leadership, to bring the story to a good resolution. I'm really impressed with that. It loses the 5th star because the ending was a bit rushed and awkward. Oh well, I'll be looking forward to reading more from my once-professor! ...more Nice change of pace for a while, but get ready to transfer to the bore train.

Yo se cuando un libro me esta gustando demasiado. Esas ultimas 40 paginas no las pude haber le\u00eddo mas lento. Lo juro. Cada p\u00e1rrafo era de \u201cRespira. Ok. Que esta pasando? Dios m\u00edo!\u201d \u201cOk. Vuelve a leer ese p\u00e1rrafo, Denisse.\u201d Se los juro, me pasa con cada libro que llega a encantarme, las ultimas p\u00e1ginas las leo super lento. Nunca me hab\u00eda decidido a leer a Sanderson, por no se que raz\u00f3n, pero definitivamente me leer\u00e9 mas a este autor. Si esta es su novela con mas fallas, seg\u00fan mucha gente, no se ni como de geniales estar\u00e1n sus otros libros! No me los puedo perder! Por otro lado, aunque el ritmo del libro es lento, siempre pasa algo importante en cada capitulo. La partida de ajedrez- politicareligiosa se maneja excelentemente bien. Me gusta que se conozcan a todos los bandos de forma pausada para que tu mismo los vayas tanteando.

No porque alentara lo que iba a hacer, si no porque tuvo una historia bastante compleja, con sus altibajos claro, pero bastante interesante.

Adem\u00e1s me encanto todo lo relacionado con el sistema de magia, y que no se supiera mucho de ella, hasta casi al final. Me gusto como se resolvieron las cosas, Sanderson se tomo su tiempo para llegar a ellas , en lugar de poner acci\u00f3n a lo bestia, y eso se lo aplaudo. A pesar de que la trama va lenta, yo la disfrute mucho mas gracias a eso, llegas a apreciar relajadamente toda la historia.

This book was full of interesting characters and a healthy plot, lots of world building, and lots of information without being \"info-dumpy\".

The curse comes swiftly and without warning, and those taken by it are banished to live the rest of their lives within This was my first foray into Sanderson's novels, and I must say I was not disappointed. This book was full of interesting characters and a healthy plot, lots of world building, and lots of information without being \"info-dumpy\". Ten years after the fall of Elantris, rumored to be a city of gods among men, the country of Arelon is plagued with a crippling disease called the Shaod. The curse comes swiftly and without warning, and those taken by it are banished to live the rest of their lives within the walls of the ruined Elantris. This novel follows three distinct perspectives - the recently afflicted Prince Raoden, his fianc\u00e9 Sarene and Princess of the neighboring country Teod, and a high ranking priest, Hrathen. Each has their own ideas about how to save the peaceful country of Arelon from the looming threat of total annihilation if it continues to resist religious conversion. I absolutely loved most of the characters in this novel. They were realistic, flawed, and passionate. Sanderson wrote nearly all of them in a way that invests you in their outcome, which is a distinct talent when you're writing high fantasy. Normally with multiple narratives, I find myself rushing through some characters in favor of others. With this book though I was solidly interested in each path and how they would all weave themselves together by the end. Characters were placed in situations that forced them to develop and grow in a meaningful way, and it was wonderful. As far as plot goes, there was a heavy emphasis on political and religious relationships and I adored that. Sanderson developed a some solid ideologies in his fantasy world and embellished on them through his characters. I was fascinated, angry, disturbed, & curious as the world unfolded before me, and shortly into the novel it felt natural reading the names and occurrences happening outside of our central country. Sanderson took the opportunity to seamlessly bury explanations for his world into the characters dialogue, interactions, & inner reflections. My only real issue with this book was the pacing. Approximately 90% of the story adopts a slower, methodical pacing that was even across the board for our three main perspectives. It switched just at the right moments to leave you thirsting for more. And then in the very last segment of the book *BOOM BOOM BOOM! REVELATIONS! SECRETS UNCOVERED! SOLUTIONS! TWIST TWIST TWIST! RESOLUTION!* I was just sitting there in my bed saying \"Holy shit. Holy shit! HOLY SHIT!!\" over and over. Finishing things up this quickly really took away from the feelings that come with a long awaited resolution. I was getting worried around T-minus 100 pages that there couldn't possibly be a way to resolve everything that was happening in such a small amount of time, but around 70 pages left the story just exploded into action. I was scared for my life alright. It's like, if you spend an hour building a nicely designed house of cards with a sturdy base and a consistent support structure all the way up until the last few levels and then you throw a bunch of ill-planned cards on top and call it a day? Overall, this was a fantastic read. Would recommend for those of us who love fantasy, if you can prepare for a very strange bit of pacing near the very end. ...more 5 stars Epic Buddy read with my favorite fantasy junkies Robin(Bridge Four) , Gavin , Armina , Alexa , Desinka July 4 I have Sandersonitis Elantris being Brandon's first published book, I didn't expect much from it, even more so because I started to read Elantris right after finishing Words of Radiance, where every single sentence is a small work of art in a bigger masterpiece.

The Transformation... When it came, the fortunate person's life ended and began anew; he would discard his old, mundane existence and move to Elantris. Elantris, where he could live in bliss, rule in wisdom, and be worshiped for eternity. Eternity ended ten years ago.\u201d 10 years ago the home of gods, inhabitated by people holding divine powers, it is now a quarantine for walking corpses, people affected by the so called \"Shaod\", whose souls still live while their hearts no longer beat, their bodies no longer heal, but they can still feel the pain of every little injury they get, causing them to lose their minds after some time and transforming them into so called \"Hoed\". Prince Raoden of Arelon wakes up five days before his planned wedding with Princess Sarene and finds himself affected by Shaod. His own father, King Iadon, exiles him into Elantris, keeping this a secret from everyone else, since getting rid of Raoden was a political convenience for him. Sarene on her part arrives in Arelon, hearing that her fiance is dead, but she is still legally bound to their wedding by the contract and thus now a widow. Sarene quickly suspects that Iadon is hiding something and tries to figure out what actually happened to Raoden, at the same time trying to save whole Arelon, while Prince Raoden attempts to make Elantris a better place. Then there is Hrathen, a Fjordell gyorn (sort of a priest) who arrives in Arelon with a three month deadline to convert people to his religion, or else the Arelish people will get roasted by his god or something. Memorable (side) characters: Eondel, Roial, Ashe, ... But my favorite was Galladon, the grumpy Dula with the problem to every solution , who kept on making me laugh out loud with his rants. \u201cI'm Galladon, from the sovereign realm of Duladel. I'm most recently from Elantris, land of sludge, insanity, and eternal perdition. Nice to meet you.\u201d As gloomy as Elantris was painted, I was totally fascinated by this world inside a world, by the mysteries to solve, amused by Sarene's initial conversations with the King ( \"I am painting, father\" ), imagining a bunch of noble ladies fencing in their fancy dresses, and I really felt with those beings in Elantris, and some loved and hated characters. Definitely worth the read if you have a little patience with the partially slow pacing. ...more What happens after the Fall?

Sanderson sets up a complex and unique fantasy world, with a magical system built on glyphs of power drawn in the air. The Elantrians were nearly godlike beings with glowing, silver skin and powerful magical abilities. Ordinary humans would sometimes randomly transform into Elantrians. But ten years before, the transformation process was twisted into something horrible: the Elantrians turned into diseased-looking horrors, their glowing, lovely city of Elantris became decayed and covered with slime, and the magic was lost. But life goes on. And different people and factions are seeking to fill the power vacuum left when Elantris fell. Elantris alternates between three viewpoints: Prince Raoden, who has just turned into an Elantrian as the story begins, and is thrown into Elantris to live or die; Sarene, the princess of a nearby country who had just arrived to marry Raoden, but is told he is dead; and Hrathen, the priest of a third country who is seeking to claim Raoden's country for his own emperor, by conversion or conquest. The stories of these three characters are intertwined, but each character has a distinct point of view and their purposes often conflict. Hrathen, the red-robed priest, was perhaps the most complex character, struggling with fears and doubts and pride. But I actually enjoyed Raoden's and Sarene's parts of the story more. Raoden, especially, grabbed my interest, as well as my admiration, as he tries to deal with his terrible and painful transformation, figure out why the magic of Elantris was lost, and rescue himself and other Elantrians from the desperate existence they've been thrown into. And, not incidentally, get to know his fianc\u00e9e Sarene (who believes he's dead, remember) when she visits the city of Elantris. They're arguably a bit of a Mary Sue couple, but personally I don't mind reading about really admirable characters when it's well done. This was Brandon Sanderson's first novel, and that shows somewhat. It's a fairly lengthy novel and periodically got a little long-winded and tedious, except for the ending, which seemed a little rushed. But the sheer amount of creativity in it is impressive and I found the main characters sympathetic. Overall it kept me interested until the end. And I've gained a new appreciation for fantasy novels that don't require you to read a sequel to get the whole story!

Sanderson is fast becoming one of my favourite fantas Following the resounding success of my Locus Quest , I faced a dilemma: which reading list to follow it up with? Variety is the spice of life, so I\u2019ve decided to diversify and pursue six different lists simultaneously. This book falls into my GIFTS AND GUILTY list. Regardless of how many books are already queued patiently on my reading list, unexpected gifts and guilt-trips will always see unplanned additions muscling their way in at the front. Sanderson is fast becoming one of my favourite fantasy writers. He\u2019s not the \u2018best\u2019 fantasy writer (or the most gritty, imaginative, revolutionary or whatever). But I think Sanderson offers the most accessible, enticing and addictive reading experience in modern fantasy. I\u2019d previously read his original Mistborn trilogy (but not yet his Alloy of Law continuation) and now Elantris too \u2013 and all four books went down sm ooo th. You\u2019re hooked before you realise it, they\u2019re damn difficult to put down, and the pages seem to fly by in a blur. I have to single out his magic systems for praise. It\u2019s easy to fall back on fantasy clich\u00e9s \u2013 magic wands, magic spells, magical potions, magical creatures, etc. It\u2019s far harder to build a magic system from the ground up, sort of twisting the underlying physics of a world. Mistborn uses a magical system based on consuming metal, and Elantris uses a magical system based on drawing glyphs in the air. Broadly speaking, after building a functional world on his new system, Sanderson then crashes the system and sets his stories in the chaos that follows. The city of Elantris has fallen. Ten years down the line, what was once the glowing home of demi-gods, home of wonders and miracles, is now a rotting prison city for cursed half-mad immortals. The empire to which Elantris was the capital has fractured and splintered, threatened by their fanatical religious/military neighbours. We come into this world from three perspectives: Raoden is prince and heir to the Kingdom. He awakes to find himself taken by the magical illness which dooms him to banishment in Elantris. Sarene is a princess, due to marry Raoden (who she\u2019s never met) to form an alliance between the two Little Kingdoms in the face of the Evil Empire. Her ship arrives and she learns her fianc\u00e9 is dead \u2013 the truth has been swept under the carpet. Hrathen is the most unusual character \u2013 a senior priest for the Evil Empire, sent to the Kingdom to convert it peacefully to their religion before a deadline \u2013 if he fails: war. The story cycles between the three characters, chapter after chapter and gives the telling a strong, steady pace and rhythm. Each of the characters is strong, wilful, passionate, flawed and likeable. I\u2019m torn over Raoden. His storyline focuses on what life is like is Elantris and his efforts to restore peace and order there, and then to discover why Elantris fell and how to reverse that. This is the main thrust of the fantasy, so the ideas here are superb, but for Raoden himself it all seems a bit too easy. Sarene takes the detective roll. Legally, she\u2019s already married to the \u2018dead\u2019 Raoden, so she arrives as a widow in a foreign court which excludes women from authority. She\u2019s trying to discover what the hell is going on and to foil Hrathen at the same time. Hrathen was my favourite character, and he provides all the intrigue outside of Elantris. He\u2019s the baddie (trying to overthrow the king and put a convert on the throne, and turn the citizens against Elantris as monsters on their doorstep) but he\u2019s also a goodie (trying to convert the kingdom peacefully before his nation\u2019s semi-demonic army arrives and crushes them). He\u2019s cunning and cool under pressure, moral but doubting his faith, and follows a strong transformational character arc. There are a couple of downsides worth mentioning: It\u2019s a touch clunky in the way the three main characters all see what\u2019s going on in the kingdom more clearly than everyone else. It\u2019s like they\u2019re the only bright, level headed people in that whole land \u2013 everyone else is either a bit dumb, or just lacking in initiative. It\u2019s kind of cartoony in how clearly delineated the different factors are. This isn\u2019t exactly a bad thing \u2013 but it is simplistic, which makes it easy to be dismissive if you come to if from some complex, morally ambiguous, fantasy reading. Overall, Elantris is a really enjoyable book which, as a stand-alone fantasy, doesn\u2019t require further instalments to reach a satisfying conclusion. I can happily recommend for jaded fantasy fans looking for a light and tasty snack, and those with only an occasional interest in the genre simply looking for a good book.

The world building isn't as strong as in his other books (there is a lot of name-dropping rather than him really showing the reader the different places), the magic system is a lot less developed and it's missing the kind of epic plot twist(s) I've become used to getting from Sanderson.

However, by no means am I saying that this book wasn't good. It was. I enjoyed every minute of it (despite the fact that it was too long) and Sarene is one of my new favourite female characters. It's been a long time since I related to a fictional someone this much. My recommendation to different types of readers: 1. You've read and loved Sanderson books before and plan on reading all (or most of his books) --> Obviously read it. Duh. 2. You've read and enjoyed one or more Sanderson books but aren't sure if this one is worth reading --> It is, definitely pick it up. 3. You haven't read any Sanderson but want to get into his books --> Don't start with this one, it's not his best work. I suggest starting with The Final Empire or Warbreaker if you aren't ready to dive into a big series. 4. You've read Sanderson before and didn't like it --> I don't think this is the book that will change your mind.
