Would also recommend it to those who loved The Elegance of the Hedgehog but thought it might have been a bit twee. Just re-read after 10 years after really enjoying DeWitt's very different second novel, Lightning Rods , which just came out. In the past decade I've crammed in a few hundred novels, a few hundred pages of my own writing, and an MFA etc. And it's still one of my all-time faves, maybe my favorite contemporary novel, up there with Infinite Jest , 2666 , and An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter . It's 530 pages but it feels more like 325 since there are tons of blank pages and pages without much text in English on them and spare dialogue throughout that flies down the page. It's a virtuosic performance about the limits of virtuosity. An explicitly intelligent, skillful novel about the necessity of something more than intelligence and skill. Structurally, it has two parts, one narrated by the mother and the other narrated by the son. The first part narrated by the mother is joyous as the main characters emerge, especially as the six-year-old genius son goes to school for the first time. <---C>Ludo</---C>, age six, knows Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and is learning Japanese, etc, etc, but mostly wants to learn who his biological father is. The second half of the book is narrated by Ludo, age 11, who hunts down seven potential fathers, all of them geniuses/ heroes, some more vividly described by the author than others, but all of them making the end sadder and more \"poignant\" than the opening. It's set in London in the mid-'90s, not 16th Century Japan. It has nothing to do with the Tom Cruise movie of the same name, although it's thematically perfect that this book, which constantly refers to Kurosawa's \"The Seven Samurai\" and is about parrying the blow brought down on the head by worldwide cultural idiocy (<---B>\"Sesame Street seems about the right level\"</---B>) is confused with a Tom Cruise movie. On second read, I thought some of the potential fathers were rushed a little bit, that the last 100 pages got a bit thin at times, but not enough to undermine my love. A few days ago, very sheepishly asked Ms. DeWitt to sign my first edition hardback after a New Directions 75th Anniversary reading event thing in NYC. Very awkward to approach someone you know and love who has no clue who you are, of course. I wanted to give her a hug but she's sort of birdlike compared to this bearlike reader, plus it could have been misconstrued as assault. Above her signature, she wrote \"A good samurai will parry the blow\" -- and I think that's why folks love this book. Not only is it explicitly intelligent and original, with text appearing in Japanese, Greek, and Icelandic , but it has such a heart, is more about how one survives when caught out in the storm of shit (see the last line of By Night in Chile ). Also re-watched all 200 minutes of \"The Seven Samurai\" last night after finishing the novel. Really a wonderful afternoon and night, especially on a cold snowy/sleety Saturday in October. Review of first read, sometime in 2002 or so: One of my fave books.<---F> Totally amazing literary fun</---F>. Totally underhyped. Watch The 7 Samurai and read this and have a damn fine high-art aesthetic experience. Please, dear friends, read this fucker and help raise Helen Dewitt to her proper status as Queen of England, even if she lives in Connecticut or wherever and was reported missing for a while two years ago. Really a can't miss, wonderfully fast, intelligent, funny novel. ...more Six stars! Seven stars! Hell, a herd of stars.

I went to amazon, checked out the used copies, and instead of hitting Add to Wishlist, I clicked Add to Cart. Things were in the works, a copy headed my way. All\u2019s good. By the time the book arrived, my mother had been hospitalized, lost consciousness, and the word \u2018immanent\u2019 was being heard frequently. While my sister and I sat vigil, <+++>The Last Samurai</+++> arrived, and I grabbed it on my way back to the hospital thinking a whopper would absorb large amounts of time otherwise spent simply waiting. I picked it up, not knowing what to expect, dreading what might have been James Clavell, and started to read. Whoa! WTF is this? I zipped through the first fifth of the book in what seemed like no time at all, entirely caught up, thoroughly amused, stunned by the find that had found me. I was as excited by the novel as I was uncomfortable with idea of being entertained at that particular time. Catharsis is a lovely, dreadful thing. Sibylla, a single mother, is an American living in London, raising a precocious child, while slavishly transcribing back issues of journals such as British Ostrichkeeper and The Poodle Breeder for a very modest wage. Ludo, her son and a reader from about age three, spends his time reading, learning multiple languages and science, and doggedly trying to coax the name of his father from his reluctant mother. Their story is literate and funny, heartwarming and joyous. Their story yields to his story\u2014a bildungsroman and a quest novel. The author\u2019s knowledge is dazzling. I want more\u2014whatever story she chooses to tell. Thanks, Lee, for the tip.

Yet it speaks like the Christian story of the Apostles at Pentecost with tongues of fire over them and and they speak all the languages of the world to each other with equal understanding. The story begins with a mother, Sibylla. She lives a life burdened with high expectations and doubly burdened when she cannot reach up to them. Her father was an atheist who went to a ninth-rate seminary to please his father and became a failed business man. Her mother was a musician repressed into accounting by her neurotic father who would not be satisfied even by genius. She went into Oxford and buried herself deep in into intellectual specificity and obscurity, and now writes for pet magazines. After a one-night stand with a writer she calls 'Liberace' for his vainglory, she gives birth to a son. She names him Ludo. He learns quickly, too quickly. He takes in vector calculus, ancient Greek, French, classical Chinese, Arabic, Icelandic, French and colloquial Japanese like water. It is thus fitting that his name comes from the Latin ludus, meaning game. All of it is a game to him. He plays with Greek verb declensions and original Icelandic sagas and counting Chinese and Japanese numbers and marks up The Odyssey with fat colored markers. When he is introduced to primary school, he argues with the teacher about John Stuart Mill and concludes, without a hint of arrogance, that schooling would be a disaster. Ludo is a lonesome child. By age 11, his only socialization aside from his mother is with the other children in his judo class. His mother withdraws further into herself. His father was never here. Instead, Sibylla plays the Kurosawa movie, Seven Samurai , as a surrogate for Ludo's father and as obsessive emotional distraction for himself. At this point, Ludo concludes that he must find his own father. Here the narrative shifts entirely. Ludo's mother fades almost entirely from the picture as he searches for his new father. The facts multiply. Facts are not answers. Experimental novels often shy away from plots and narratives, but there is still 'A Story' here, cloaked in the references to the Seven Samurai and the Odyssey. Genius, as expanding and powerful as it can be, is not always the lone answer to emotional isolation. This second story is about making peace with these images we have of ourselves, and of attempting to find some value in ourselves if we cannot reach these imagined ideals. Realizing that we are human and thus limited in our capabilities does not mean that every person should kill themselves or despair, it is a push some other emotional grounding. If the boy's father is lacking or insufficient, then he decides that someone else must be his father - not a genetic father, but symbolic father. The story is then a series of emotional dialogues between a boy searching for a father and a father who is human and therefore deficient in some way. Not just to the artificially high standards of the boy, but because they are all human. The Last Samurai is somehow a book with both vast learning and feeling - these things are so often portrayed as mutually exclusive, but here they are together. It is an intellectual investigation and a psychological journey, one which retells the old story of mother, father, and son through a new vessel, on to new shores. The samurai has parried the blow. ...more Imagine the written version of an orchestral suite, different instruments taking their turns cutting in and out, challenging, responding, developing themes, repeating themes, breaking off for a little bit of opera here, a little pas-de-deux there with a couple of guest solos thrown in, while nevertheless returning continually to the main theme and finally leading into a very fitting coda.

That\u2019s what reading this book was like for me. Books like The Last Samurai don\u2019t come my way very often which is a great pity. On the other hand, reading The Last Samurai has exercised my brain so much that maybe it is a good thing that there aren\u2019t too many like it out there. Imagine if I became obsessed with this book and reread it as often as the narrators watch Kurosawa\u2019s Seven Samurai? Would I then have rudimentary Japanese plus a smattering of Greek, Hebrew and Arabic, be able to understand complex maths and physics and aerodynamics, play excellent chess, bridge and picquet as well as the XXV variations of Alkan\u2019s Festin d\u2019Aesope on the piano and appreciate every last twist and turn of the plot of Seven Samurai?

Trouble is that this time of year one starts reflecting back over the year and preparing to prepare that kind of Read\u2019in Reading List ; in order to submit it to a big swarm of lists which are already listing on the over-done side. So one thing again that occurs to me is that I\u2019ve read a lot of stuff for the first time. I mean, I\u2019ve read a lot of authors for the first time. For a Completionist Obsessionist (CO) such as myself, this is an oddity. Here\u2019s a few names attached to books which were First Timers for me, best I can recollect :: <---A>Helen DeWitt</---A> (thanks to those Fellow Readers who salvaged her from my savaging in my Place/Medusa Review. Thanks!) Vanessa Place Christoph Martin Wieland Grete Weil Wendy Walker Paul Verhaeghen Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107 Amos Tutuola Jonathan Swift (? probably not) Ronald Sukenick Ali Smith Xiaoxiao Lanling Sheng Philip Roth (probably?) Maurice Roche Ishmael Reed Anne G\u00e9d\u00e9on LaFitte, Marquis de Pelleport Gil Orlovitz Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont Lee Klein Danilo Ki\u0161 Guillermo Cabrrera Infante Liam Howley H.D. Gustave Flaubert Henry Fielding Ralph Ellison Rosalyn Drexler W. COQ Kay Boyle Robert Bola\u00f1o Oh dear that is rather a lot. I promise you I\u2019ll do more of the Competionism stuff next year, same old horse; I\u2019ve got a lot of outstanding stuff and thereto I\u2019ve added a few names you\u2019ll discover in that list I just listed. One should not neglect to read something from Raymond Federman. So my intention of writing a proper review here is not going so well. Look, there\u2019s a number of big books I\u2019ve been trying to finally getting around to knock off this time of year and DeWitt\u2019s is the third following the DeLillo and the Bola\u00f1o. There\u2019ll be more of those two on my horizon. DeWitt\u2019s got one more which is also on my horizon. And if she has more of her own books on her own horizon, those books too will horizon themselves for me. Thank you. I\u2019d really like to get Darkmans and Where Tigers Are at Home tic\u2019d off by the end of the year. Both look Delisch! But it is what you\u2019d call a fast read (don\u2019t you dare say \u201cprecocious\u201d, not even one more time!!). As pointed out, and really this kind of thing should count as one of those ubiquitous critiques/complaints, the obverse of the \u201cneeds to loose about 500 pages\u201d critique/complaint, The Last Samurai has a lot of blank pages among its 530 pages. I mean a lot of blank pages. Just blank. Simply blank. Nothing printed on them. There\u2019s very little doubt in my mind there\u2019s a purpose to them. And I like book art and book objects and I like the arts & crafts of bookmaking and bookbinding and related arts & crafts. But it is a lot of blank pages. And then a lot of pages with printing on them also have a lot of white space which is not uncommon especially in passages of dialogue or when there is some fine point of Japanese grammar or what have you to be made. It\u2019s also really rather easy to read. And especially if you know some Japanese there might be some fine jokes in there which I didn\u2019t get. A lot of the white space serves to demarcate various chapters and sections and parts ; the relations among which I\u2019ve not parsed. There could be some value in parsing out those sections. Maybe I should do that next. I\u2019m just typing here to hear myself type. Self-indulgence. Not at your expense. You can just move on at any time. Don\u2019t worry about hitting that Like button even if you don\u2019t read or if you only skim. I\u2019m never one hundred percent certain what it means when a person hits my buttons.

But you can visit those pages at your leisure. But the thing is that each of those part/title/etc dividers represents on average approximately three pages of blank space. Treat them like you would treat a rest in a musical score. Or just rudely fast forward to the fast and loud parts. We\u2019ll estimate about/approximately (product of three and forty) 120 pages of white with and without part/chapter/section titles (however you call these things). Sounds like a lot, but I\u2019m not counting the white space produced by the occasional subsection dividers (ie, \u201c\u2756\u201d) which produce a much greater quantity of white space than is the case in the average book formatting strategy. Here\u2019s the tune \u201cApproximate\u201d, featuring Ruth Underwood on Vibes, by Frank Zappa :: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89LPV... Dance you fuckers!!!! Any chance I can run out my character limit? How many is that? Anyone know off hand? At any rate, now we\u2019ve gotten a kind of ToC and we\u2019ve produced a rough rough estimate of the blank pages and white spots (disappointed not to see one of those all=black pages made famous in those other books, but, again I repeat, What are you going to do?) in this here book. It\u2019s not a very important thing to do. Unless you are a book designer. Speaking of which, I\u2019m also disappointed not to find an About the Type entry on the final pages. Sometimes you might find those things on the copyright page, but no such luck in this case. If I assemble a number of these reviews and Reviews I\u2019ve written on gr (goodreads.com) and have them printed and bound and listed for sale do you think you\u2019d buy one? I wouldn\u2019t. Unless I hired a really groovy book designer. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do. I\u2019d knock on the door of one of these many local design schools and hire some fresh(faced) grad who wants to work for free (for no $$$$, really) to design a nice little thing which would include all of my most popul\u2019airy reviews and Reviews (and I\u2019d throw in some stinkers cuz I just can\u2019t help it (nor do I ever think of my reader!)) and I\u2019d have this fresh(faced) design school grad make some really cool book=art out of it. It\u2019d be so cool, such excellent book-art that you wouldn\u2019t even want to bother reading the words (you\u2019ve already skim\u2019d them on=line already anyway so what\u2019s the point?) but you\u2019d luxuriate in the inexpressively awesome nature of this book=art. And after the fresh(faced) design school grad got done with her work with all the layout and typeface choices and other unfathomable things involved with designing a book I\u2019d have it sent to the printers... no no no wait!.... screw sending it to the printers! We\u2019d get one of these old fashion one-page-at-a-time handcrank type old=school printers, you know, the printing equivalent of a straight-razor, the kind of thing which increases your risk of exsanguination by a factor of seventeen, and we\u2019d pick up a guy from the Home Depot parking lot to do all the cranking and we\u2019d print off those pages one at a time and there\u2019d be a lot of pages because I\u2019ve written (or \u201cWritten\u201d) something like 561 reviews (for \u201cReviews\u201d) plus like 334 ratings (those have really gotten crusty lately!) and so we\u2019d have a lot to select from and we\u2019d probably include more than we should. At any rate, (let me know if you see some grammatical difficulties with these sentences) we\u2019d print those pages and then get them to some like really seriously artful bookbinder guy, the kind of guy like that guy who lives in the basement of that house occupied by that one famous philosophy in Cambridge you met once when you took that huge Oxford Greek dictionary to this guy to get the binding fixed, you\u2019d take it to one of these Artful=Binders who have been to Book Making (non-gambling) type schools and you\u2019d have this guy hand bind these things in like calf and other expensive stuff and probably sewn in silk if silk is good thing for binding books. It\u2019s be out of this world!!! How many more characters do I have left? Oh hey, listen, I just did some Research and I discovered this fact. gr allows 20,000 characters per Review Box. And apparently spaces like \u201c \u201c count as characters which is really queer cuz it means that I could write a review of nothing but twenty thousand (leagues under the sea!!!?) spaces and it would count! At any rate, I\u2019ll just check how many I have left now. Just a sec. ......10,113 characters left after the space following the period following \u201csec\u201d. 10,025 characters left after the period following \u2018\u201csec\u201d\u2019. So any character now we\u2019ll have used exactly half the characters allot\u2019d us by the Good People at goodreads.com.INC. Can you locate the precise location of the Ten Thousandth character? Are you still with me? (9749 up to the \u201c?\u201d you just skim\u2019d) About a year ago there\u2019d be a joke in all this. Something along the lines of \u201cOff-topic much?\u201d We\u2019d have to confess. We\u2019re just noodling. Just listening to ourselves type. Are you entertained? Bored? Would you like to take a survey which would register your satisfaction with this review? We\u2019d have maybe ten questions and you\u2019d answer some with a \u201cYes\u201d or a \u201cNo\u201d or some non-excluded middle term and some you\u2019d answer by circling any one numeral along a range ranging from one to ten. \u201cWould you like to edit this mess?\u201d might be one question. Another question might be, \u201cWould you like to provide this survey with its next question?\u201d Both would be of the first kind, the kind where it\u2019d be appropriate to answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d or some non-excluded middle term. Can you think of a question to ask which would require a numerical answer? I\u2019m think of the kind of thing you\u2019d get in the ED (used to be known as the \u201cER\u201d and there was even a TV show with that title which at first I pronounced like the german word it looked like to me) where they\u2019d say like \u201cHow much pain are you in?\u201d or \u201cHow intense is the pain you are experiencing?\u201d or something like that and they\u2019d say that zero (or one, however it\u2019s arranged) is the total absence of pain or utter bliss (however the specific scale is scaled) and ten would be like mortifying, howling, Oh My Fucking God IT HURTS, kill me now! kind of pain -- and if you\u2019re not in such agony that you can\u2019t understand what the fuck they\u2019re asking you try to come up with a reasonable guess as to how best to turn your fucking awful pain into some kind of meaningful numerical-rhetorical schema. So maybe perhaps we\u2019d ask something like \u201cOn a scale of one to ten, one being something like utter=\u201dmeh\u201d and ten being like Best Thing After Finnegans Wake, how Great, how Fantastic would you say this review written this day the Eighth of December in the year of 2014 by Nathan \u201cN.R.\u201d Gaddis of Helen DeWitt\u2019s massively awesome 2000 novel, The Last Samurai (that\u2019s a big \u201cN.R.\u201d to that Cruise movie of like title) is?\u201d And you\u2019d have to pick a number between one and ten. Best just get out your dodecahedron die. Where\u2019s that thing on my word processing dealie that tells me how many characters (including spaces) I\u2019ve used? I\u2019ve got word count down here (2338 it says) but I\u2019d like to count those characters in anticipation of what the gr Review Box is going to say. Oh wait, I see it. It pop\u2019d up over there on the right hand side of my screen where it was camafloged by this youtoob mix of Frank Zappa Live! I\u2019ve been watching. Right now they\u2019re playing a The Roxy Theatre (1973) which is really about the best era of Zappadom, partly because you see he\u2019s just so damn happy playing with a great fucking band and the music\u2019s cool and he actually enjoys the audience and all this kind of stuff (I like the \u201988 tour stuff too). At any rate, the stats thing which is included with my word processor now says \u201cCharacters: 13,172\u201d. It\u2019s hard to type cuz it changes as I type. Let\u2019s try again. The stats thing says \u201cCharacters: 13,279\u201d. So when I hit \u201c9\u201d the whole thing changed to \u201c13,280\u201d so you see what I mean when I say it\u2019s hard to type because it changes as I type it. Basically, the numeral \u201c9\u201d when I typed \u201c13,279\u201d was the 13,280th character in this document. But don\u2019t count on it because I might go back up above there and do some editing and cutting-n-slicing and basically just changing stuff, so some of these numbers might not quite be accurate in any kind of finished form of this document right here. Two of my favorite Zappa tracks are \u201cPenguin in Bondage\u201d and \u201cMontana\u201d. \u201cPenguin in Bondage\u201d is the opening track of his album \u201cRoxy and Elsewhere\u201d which is like one of my favorite Zappa albums and is the track I remember first hearing which really turned me on to Frank\u2019s music although of course like everyone else I\u2019d heard \u201cBobby Brown Goes Down\u201d a lot when that guy Bobby Brown (wife=beater Bobby) went down because the radio DJs thought it a funny song to play. Also \u201cDon\u2019t Eat The Yellow Snow\u201d which is only part of a larger suite which is pretty cool.

Yes, you in the back with the extremely bored/annoyed/irritated expression on your horse=like face. Yes, thank you for taking my call, big fan, long time listener, first time caller and all that etc etc etc ;; but what I\u2019d really like to know and I\u2019m sure just about everyone else reading this thing would like to know is, Who are you making fun of? Who are you parodying? Who are you travestying? That\u2019s a very good question. Perhaps it would be best to poll our readership and see what they think. We could really get to the bottom of things...... I\u2019d also like to ask, sort of a two=parter, Don\u2019t you have anything better to do? 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) all of the above. Yes. btw, if you see things like \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d instead of where \u201cyour\u201d should be or like if you see \u201cit\u2019s\u201d where an \u201cits\u201d should be it\u2019s not because I can\u2019t or don\u2019t differentiate between the two very different words but it\u2019s because everything that\u2019s in my brain that finds its way onto this white splotch in cyber=space is mediated through my CANTANKEROUS KEYBOARD and the situation is not improved in that sometimes my fingers have a different opinion than my brain and perform what might only be characterized as grammatical sabotage. So seriously, if you wnat to make a FEDERAL case about my not proof-reading my own goddman work I sya, \u201cwell you know wnat i\u2019mabout to say and it\u2019s not fitfor the younguns so just cover there ears before I\u201d old joke, I know. Apologies. But I did just correct one of those \u201cyou\u2019re\u201ds to the correct \u201cyour\u201d. Things like that will perpetually embarrass, especially if your make you living telling other people how illiterate they are just because they have to work with a CANTANKEROUS KEYBOARD. I feel like I\u2019m sort of hogging all this cyber=space and really I\u2019m not the type of creature that tends towards the Monolingual, but much prefer the Dilingual. Although probably a better term would be dialogical or something, which isn\u2019t exactly what Bahktin is talking about, but it\u2019s kind of similar. What I mean is that rather than Hold Forth I\u2019d much rather have a pint or two with you and we can go back and forth. I guess the Ancients might have called it dialectic. Or just discussion or conversation. So, and I know this is sort of a hollow gesture given the structure of this Review Box, but I\u2019d like to provide you, My Treasured Review Reader, with a little space of your own so that your voice too might be heard.

No, but I think you make a very good point. And I\u2019d rather (I mean I feel like I\u2019ve been talking and talking and it\u2019s time for someone else maybe to get a word in edgewise) maybe hand the mike over to other people in our reading audience today and see what they have to say about your question.

Oh yeah I totally agree that this here is pure entertainment (if that!) and doesn\u2019t even begin to nudge something we might call \u201cart\u201d. But what is art anyway? I think maybe some people think a toilet in a museum is art so it\u2019s really hard to say. I mean in an objective sort of way. Is The Last Samurai art? or is it just a novel? something to kill some time while sitting enthroned? maybe it reshapes the world we live in? ...more There is a LOT in this book.

I need to write a review, especially after the last quote I put up which is throughly insufficient to describe The Last Samurai. What shall I DO? I'm stuck in a rut myself. I've been doing this for too long. I keep telling myself I should bite the bullet... and make a comeback. What's the use of spending my life in this room? What's the use of me sitting in front of this blank screen trying to achieve some undefined ideal in book reviewing? There is a LOT in this book. A lot of ideas. A lot of layers and those ideas manifest differently in different layers. The book is structured in two parts. The first is predominantly written in Sybilla's voice. Single mother to a precocious Ludo, who is as precocious as the word precocious can suggest. She takes parenting seriously. Teaching him to learn Greek at the age of four, debating whether she should rebuke him for walking home from a concert by himself at the wee hours of the morning and generally having an internal dialogue on everything concerning Ludo. Her outlook towards parenting is influenced by what she lacked growing up with parents who were frustrated by not being able to achieve their potential. She believes that the structure of power between parent and child is imbalanced and seeks to better it in her relationship with ludo In a less barbarous society children would not be in the absolute economic subjection to the irrational beings into whose keeping fate has consigned them: they would be paid a decent hourly wage for attending school. Sybilla repeatedly plays Kurosawa's Seven Samurai to substitute for the lack of a male figure in Ludo's life. The movie serves as a substitute for the kind of human connection she desires but neither pursues nor talks about throughout the book. The second part is in Ludo's voice. He decides to find his father through bits of information from Sybilla and a letter she had written for Ludo in case she died. On finding his biological father and being unimpressed and mildly disgusted, he decides to seek a father figure. The quest is filled with disappointments but he learns to navigate the realm of human emotions. Having being subject to years of Seven Samurai, it is only natural that he should test if the potential fathers will parry the blow Helen DeWitt's prose grasps the cacophonous nature of living in the 21st century. It shifts between diary entries, conversation, snippets of books and stream of consciousness. Some of the parallels she drew are so good, they should become a part of everyday life. She likens her one night stand with Ludo's biological father to an unpleasant medley, where the performers transition uncomfortably from one song to another and just when the song gets mildly comfortable it shifts to another one. Medley sex has nice ring to it and makes for a useful phrase today. I'd watched Seven Samurai once before I started the book. I've watched it thrice since. The book serves as an excellent companion for the movie but the converse is what makes this book a masterpiece. DeWitt has structured the book to make it subtly similar to the critical analyses of the movie, snippets of which also feature in the movie. While this serves as an intellectual treat, it doesn't satisfy me to see that as the whole picture. The meticulous manner in which she chooses to overlap Seven Samurai and The Last Samurai in style suggests that she wants you to pay attention to specific details. She speaks about how one perceives art Once you saw that you could potentially have dozens of fragments that could not be part of the finished work, and what you saw was that it was perceiving these fragments as fragments that made it possible to have a real conception of what wholeness might be in a work The fragments of the father figures, is what allows Ludo a perception of wholeness in a human. Reconciling with all those fragments is what makes Ludo a genuine samurai There are several underlying themes that mature along with the novel, along with Ludo. There is one idea that provides a point of action when you wonder, WHAT shall I DO? It seemed to me that the events of The Last Samurai all culminated to this idea. It is literally untrue to suggest that peace, contentment, happiness, follows a single battle, no matter how important, and that a hero who actually becomes is tantamount to a villain . Ludo parries the blow. Ludo doesn't become. -- 29 April, 2015 ...more Someone\u2019s mother once said \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d Well, I was never one to take unsolicited advice.

Actually, I am now remembering quitting From Hell by Alan Moore more recently. Dewitt's book rambles on and on, skittering over endless senseless topics; it is cloaked as an \u201cintellectual, tour de force, playful, multi-layered, but wonderfully readable\u201d (according to the jacket flap so it must be true.) She interrupts her vignettes, with even less meaningful interludes. If there was a central theme, it was lost on me. I love one reviewer\u2019s comment: \u201cNo wonder she never finished college. She can\u2019t seem to think in a straight line.\u201d Her disdain for traditional education, especially for the gifted, is repeated ad nauseum, which I am quite sure was her own personal experience. And why does she think \u201c&\u2019s\u201d are so cool? An utterly unnecessary affectation. Do yourself a huge favor, skip this one. ...more There's some heart in this novella after all.

In my line of work, I often come across people who feel depressed. And I think, well, I have no degree in psychology. I'm certainly not qualified. But then I also think, what the hell? Sometimes people just simply need to know that someone is listening. So I try to listen. But I'm not always so good at getting people to talk. So I often end up doing more talking than I should be doing and I'm always aware of this while it is happening. But I keep thinking, maybe I'll hit the right combination. And even if I don't see the effect now, even if it looks like a failure, maybe there's some fragment, some leitmotif that will resonate at some point and help. I usually find myself saying that everyone who is paying attention to the world will be depressed some day or other. That if you're NOT depressed, maybe that's when there's something wrong. What matters is how we respond to it and how we can attend to life. How we can observe and create beauty. The splinter in your eye is the best magnifying glass (Adorno). The key is not to let your own powerlessness stupefy you (Adorno again). So, I read somewhere that this novella is about the limits of intellectualism. But that's not what I thought it was about. For me, this book is about mental illness. I can't get too much more specific without having to hit the spoilers button. So on in a tangential circle line. Here's what I can say: David Foster Wallace once told Kenyon, in a now too famous speechamajig that the things you deify will come to consume you. So, if you enjoy being handsome, you will always feel ugly. If you rely on intelligence as a wellspring of self-worth, you will always worry that someone will expose you as a fraud. And though this is all a bit oversimplified, I think there's something in this. I admit, I used to think I was quite clever. And it's been quite a relief over the years to finally admit that I'm of average intelligence, at best, with maybe a longer than average attention span (though, it is waning, oh lord is it waning). So, I'm in the position to be one of this book's most sympathetic readers. Because, yes, this book is concerned with deifying genius. But in the superstructure of this book is where the real meat lies. What I saw here was the pain and necessity of making your own obsessive compulsive notes which create a calming sense of the familiar. What I saw was that mathematical vanishing points can create the simulacra, but they cannot ensoul the flesh. In sum, I liked the ideas of the book, but the brandishing of the encyclopaediac felt too much like a Wikipedia rabbit-hole. All of the pieces were there but it didn't get up and dance. My only complaint is subtle. I felt dispassion. I felt that the prose was often underwritten and not to oracular effect. But I was occasionally very immersed. Recommended for the precocious, the eisegetical, and those in need of a quick, cleanse-read. Provisionally, 3.84 stars. ...more [no spoilers] One of my favorite books ever.

In other words, Machisu's character - in early childhood portrayed as a spoiled, overprivileged brat who's artistic inclinations are encouraged to an almost absurd degree - eventually comes to believe that by merely mimicking artistic styles of past masters he can attain artistic acclaim and prominence. Of course his rationalization here is intended to reveal how askew this approach to any type of human accomplishment is. It's a way of thinking that patronizes the meaning behind motivation, thus turning human accomplishment into a sterile, formalized excercise. Really no wonder that toward the end of the film, Machisu's adult character, played by Kitano himself, meets such a tragically psychopathic fate, only redeemed by the tolerant goodwill of others. Basically, Kitano is trying to suggest that Machisu has the wrong idea about what it means to be artistically driven or competitive; he is Achilles. It isn't far-fetched to think that Dewitt had Zeno's paradox in mind while shaping the character of Ludo in her debut novel The Last Samurai . And had Kitano released his film before it was written, then she would likely have made an allusion to it in the book. But hey, Seven Samurai isn't a bad point of reference either. The story follows Sibylla (undoubtedly a play on words, refering to syllabary alphabets such as the hiragana, katakana, or kanji used together to create the complex system of the Japanese language) as she raises her three year old, Ludo, to become an erudite child prodigy of sorts. Initially, she models her instruction after that of Yo Yo Ma's father by systematically teaching him little tidbits of information, gradually increasing the frequency and intensity of the information. Sibylla's confidently pedantic tone eventually gives way to the monster of intellectual force that Ludo becomes. He then searches for his estranged father, taking Kurosawa's Seven Samurai as a sort of code of ethics for his search. He finds him at first, and after realizing that he is incapable of directly telling the man that he is his son, he continues on to four more men, lying to each one about his identity as their estranged son. To some readers, Ludo might seem similar to Toph in Heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers. The difference is that Ludo's precosity is clearly intended as a moral lesson about the limits of knowledge, whereas Eggers uses such an advanced developmental tone of language in a young character merely as a hollow, quirky schtick. It's a brilliant storytelling device on Dewitt's behalf. Just reading the dialogues between Sibylla and Ludo alone, make for such an engaging read, not to mention an amusing intellectual spectacle oriented around language. This all might sound dense, but Dewitt is such a capable storyteller that her characters obsessions never overwhelm what is essentially a damn good yarn. ...more I had this at a four for a while, but I've found my thoughts wandering over to certain scenes quite frequently in the two or so months since I've read it, so I think an extra star is due.

It's easy to get off of \"death of this-or-that\" re fiction, or really any art form, because art of course moves quickly. After writing that screed I just wrote about Palahniuk, I for a moment felt disillusioned with the state of the contemporary novel. It was my belief that, because of the immense acclaim the Ellises and Franzens of this world have racked up (Ellis actually has been influential, which scares me a little... maybe I should read Tao Lin, it's sometimes fun to have a whipping boy), fiction was moving towards this \"it's vapid because we're vapid\" mode. Then I remembered this, a warm and big-hearted novel that invites us to sympathize with its characters AND call them out on their bullshit. So socially inept child prodigy Ludo and his cultured but neurotic single mother Sybilla? They fuck up all over the place, and the series of father figures Ludo runs through aren't quite equipped to handle him, but they just feel so real and so complete that I form a real and complex relationship with them. Plus, there's a great form, precise prose, and references to Kurosawa all over the joint. Reading this book is a good idea. Don't worry about a thing: that Tom Cruise movie where a white guy is better at being Japanese than actual Japanese people (see also Dances with Wolves, where a white guy is better at being Native American than actual Native Americans) has nothing to do with this. ...more Not a 3 star book, but a 1 star book and a 5 star book. 1 star because her prose is clunky (\"He said:...

Ohweee doggie this gonna shine till they's no mo sun! But that's here nor there 'cause this be across da pond in bloody ol' England, London town where our story takes place. \"Sib\" & \"Ludo\" are though, two peas in their own pod and it's not like any other mother/son we're accustomed to, they're quite in a world shut out of the \"norm\" in eccentric ways of their own devising. She adopting a style of parenting that draws upon J.S. Mill & Yo Yo Ma's both formative upbringings to include a \"do-it yourself a piece at a time\" you are your own destiny as far as you would have it education. She is divorced from the idea that a parent \"owns\" their progeny's every move - you, son or daughter are free to choose \"how\" you will raise your being in this world, I am simply benefactor who happens to have begat you. Our child prodigy quickly learns to seize upon this unshackled beneficence to begin his meteoric autodidactic by learning Greek in order to read the \"Odyssey\" in its original at age four. But that's just the beginning, it gets ramped up one language after another from there mind boggling. Another theme, if you will, is \"The Seven Samurai\" (film) that's played over and over by them both, each seeking different things from the story to patch missing pieces in their understandings of what's transpiring around them in the \"real world.\" She thinks it may stand in for his never-ending inquisitiveness about who is his father; he trying to catch-up to the emotional deficit of being a genius at so early an age thrust as it were into that quasi-adult world of independence his mother has left him to. \"A Good Samurai Will Parry The Blow.\" This continues to sustain his adult-like attempts to conquer his fast-moving rise into consciousness of massive knowledge intakes whilst needing to secure the foundation of who else begat me, and, should that matter? Even though at one point after finding his real Dad (who he realizes falls far short of expectation) and concocting to usurp others into thinking he might be their son (these also disappoint) he again draws forth from TLS (Last/Samurai) a revelation to wit: \"Looking for a father had turned out to be an unexpectedly high-risk activity. Stand behind the door, Kambei tells Katsushiro. Bring down the stick as hard as you can, it will be good training for you. Any more training and I might not live to see 12.\" He had been thrashed a bit by one of them besides the recurring letdown of inadequacy. The last father candidate was in the process of suicide when Ludo encounters him - Ludo being the logical emancipator of free will colloquy's with him about pros/cons and, if so how he might effectively and/or painlessly achieve his desired result. \"I've heard that drowning is pleasant at the end, I said.\" (Funny aside (sorta) but I've been there, done that, drowning (or nearly so) after breaking my neck diving into an Idaho reservoir, being instantly paralyzed and floating face-down for some minutes contemplating my dilemma - things slowed to a crawl after initial panic then becoming soothingly calm even blissful, seeing that white light through the tunnel - then somebody yanked me out ...) but I digress. This novel charmed me into a similar blissful calm; I loved the relationship between these characters, and even though I'm no father, would recommend to any new parent to at least consider this individual boosting style for and if a precocious child were in the mix. It's refreshing to imagine a world where kids might grab that bull horns and all, charging ahead devouring life's open lessons of learning, making choices based on individual needs and yearnings unimpeded by old school rules of dominant patrilineal over-lording, but then, I think of [some] of the bratty, helpless, selfish whimpering of today's youth (sorry millennials) and go, good lord but they need firm guidance. Oh well, we were all young once.

I loved the opening structure of the book with its middle-of-paragraph interruptions and kind of Ping-Pong narrative; I loved the journal sections of Ludo in the first half of the book. Once he firmly became the narrator in the second half of the book I felt that a lot of that which I enjoyed from the first half just kind of went away, and was left instead with a fairly standard, though well written, piece of contemporary literary fiction. It ultimately just wasn\u2019t for me; I remember a time when it would have been, and in that remembrance I recognize why this book is held in as high regard as it is \u2013 unlike many books I\u2019m not confused by its reception or praise \u2013 so it\u2019s possible (maybe even likely) that you, dear reader, will love this book. I didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s okay. Even all this said I still found the book to be a good read, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019ll revisit or think about again. When I bought this book I recognized it as an outlier when compared to the other books that clog my shelves; ultimately that was correct.

I started it during a particularly busy time - moving to a new place, working longer hours at work, etc. It wasn't especially easy to pick this up and read it in spurts, so for a while there I didn't think I was going to care much for this. It requires some attention, in the same way something like Infinite Jest requires some attention. (But, okay, let's be fair - nothing needs quite that much attention.) There are some similarities here to David Foster Wallace's popular tome - is it post-post-modernism or something? Sure, let's call it that. Wonky story-line, interesting choice of writing style, sentences that sort of end, don't go anywhere, thoughts that collide into one another. Did I require this book requires some attention? It does. It requires some work. It's the story of Sibylla and her young genius son, Ludo. The backdrop to their lives is the film Seven Samurai which Sibylla plays over and over and over again. Genius Ludo reads all the great Classics (the Odyssey , the Iliad , etc. in the original language) at an age when most kids are eating the boogers they pull out of their noses. A particularly favorite scene occurs when Sibylla tries to enroll Ludo in public school. Look, I don't normally like precocious children in literature. Sometimes it's so obnoxious I can't even handle it. Ludo is obnoxious. But he's also incredibly sweet and squeezable and I just want to sit down and talk with him. Correction: I just want to sit down and be corrected by him. Here I'd be talking about my favorite brand of burritos and he'd be rattling off something in Greek to me. This is also a coming-of-age novel of a sort. Ludo grows up a bit and just as he's starting to learn Japanese, he sets off to find his real father, or at least his ideal father. This is a clever story, sometimes too clever for its own good. DeWitt is a highly intelligent writer - she has an extensive education in language and a gaggle of other things, and she uses this book to show some of that off. It's tedious at times. But it's mostly fun. It just requires one to sit down and read large parts in one sitting in order to not ruin the flow. I've often asked why women don't tend to write books that are as popular as DFW or Pynchon or those other heavy-hitters in the \"big pretentious, post-modern book world\". Maybe I just wasn't looking. This isn't as big (page count-wise), but she could be in the same ranks as some of those other guys. (I'm saying that having not even read Pynchon's larger, more pretentious post-modern books. That's how I roll.) I can now return this to my brother. I'm looking forward to his thoughts on it. ...more The Internet is seductive to me because it enables mediated relationships, mano not quite a mano since online all manos are filtered through interfaces which are driven by carefully designed databases whose fields are finite in a way that life is not.

It is the world of 1 that's a bitch. People, emotions, love, relationships... there are no equations for this, certainly no Rosetta Stone. To some extent you can \"figure someone out\" and work that \"angle\" -- but mostly relating to others cannot be reduced to a statement like \"relating to others cannot be reduced to...\" If any of this makes any kind of sense to you, you will probably love this book as much as I do. If it all seems like gibberish, well, you still might enjoy this ambitious story that DeWitt tells with verve, vigor, and deeply human characters.

I stayed with this novel only because I am in a book club, and several had finished it before me, declaring it to be enjoyable. I don't like to be defeated by any literature, but 544 pages would have felt like a waste of my time, except that it did serve the purpose of steering me towards other, more worthy pursuits, including books, music and movies that I might not have encountered. I pity those who edited this book, and from what I have read, Ms. Dewitt was so involved in the process that she attempted suicide over disagreements on the editing. She apparently has written somewhat autobiographically in The Last Samurai, as each \"genius\" who excelled in one way or another proved him/herself unfit for society. ...more Yikes, boy this book put me in my place pretty fast, I guess I'm not an intellectual as is Helen DeWitt who spent 10 years in academia and puts it all to as much use as possible in this book.

It teaches me stuff and incorporates info-dumpy type elements, but not in a Neal Stephenson overbearingly expository sort of way... in a way that's integral to the characters and who they are(see Richard Powers.) It uses other cultural touchstones as sort of frameworks on which to hang shared meaning and around which to form identity, but not in a tossed-off and lazily referential sort of way(The difference between say, Murakami and Coupland, or Ghost World and Garden State is what I'm getting at here.) It's got a cracked and rather dry sense of humor. It employs a conversational style and a really distinctive voice(Vonnegut, but that's a double-edged sword because it also becomes what annoys me about him, and I was afraid that would be the case the second time through on this, but it wasn't). It's tangential and jumps around and weaves together narratives, but not to the point of it being ticcy and distracting about it. I think where it really excels is in characterization and in short set-piece storytelling, and most of all in the intersection of those two. The various juvenile-adventure-style tales she tells to introduce and flesh out Ludo's surrogate-father candidates are just wonderful; they work both as character sketches and as adventures and are sad and hopeful and beautiful and true. And the way she skates right on the edge of suspension of disbelief when it comes to drawing out Ludo's character is impressive too. Somehow she manages to make him believable as both an intellectual prodigy and a moral and experiential adolescent, and his constant confused and fumbling attempts to apply the rules of one sphere to the other are touching and ring true to anyone who read dictionaries and did math well before they figured out how to deal with other people. In that vein, it also has a real moral center and moral sense, even if a rather stoic and resigned one. The evolution of Ludo's relationship with his mother(also a well-drawn and unique character and mind), to the point where he's the one who has the capacity to care for her in the end, is well done. Maybe a little cliched in this day and age, but I didn't mind that at all, and perhaps the contrast even works in its favor. So, yeah, this has lots of pieces that aren't particularly amazing on their own, but combined in an artful and unusual way. It takes lots of the best tricks and elements of postmodern writing and combines them with older-fashioned bildungsroman-y notions of character and moral development and sense of childhood wonder and adventure. It combines a lot of themes, styles, references, and so on that I'm a sucker for, but without pandering or playing connect-the-dots. A masterful job of self-confident-but-not-arrogant authorial restraint and range and imagination. ...more I had high expectations for this, and my disappointment was commensurately great.

Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with being made to feel stupid by an author. When Pynchon does it, it's amazing, because he spins his eclectic general knowledge into champagne prose and expansively gorgeous narrative. This book is dry, unemotional, empty of meaning - and unbelievably contemptuous of its readership. Ludo, the young prodigy who co-narrates, is concerned only with intellectual achievements: \"who'd talk about it if I only got into Cambridge at 16?\" In life, as in literature, there are more worthwhile goals than the jealous admiration of others. Co-incidentally, I picked up Joy Williams' The Quick and the Dead after finishing this, on the back of her Paris Review interview a few months back. What a contrast! Call me a pleb, but I prefer a writer whose nous and awareness are gleamed from her style and wit, rather than tedious references to how many dead languages, ancient texts and material physics formulae she's mastered. Such achievements - astonishing though they undoubtably are - have never been the mark of great writing. ...more", "Title": "The Last Samurai"},
