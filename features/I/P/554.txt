Cant wait to start the next novel and see how this all ends! But above all, I just want this book to come out! (or at least have any spoilers - I mean, I'm dying here!) --------------------------------------------------------- That last book left me in a jumble of emotions and feels and thoughts. But I realized something worse. Since the House of Hades is the second to last book in the series, I predict there will be a big cliffhanger! You think this is bad? Just wait till we read this book! ... Yes, I acknowledge the fact that we have to wait to read this bo But above all, I just want this book to come out! (or at least have any spoilers - I mean, I'm dying here!) --------------------------------------------------------- That last book left me in a jumble of emotions and feels and thoughts. But I realized something worse. Since the House of Hades is the second to last book in the series, I predict there will be a big cliffhanger! You think this is bad? Just wait till we read this book! ... Yes, I acknowledge the fact that we have to wait to read this book for practically a year. But on a different and much happier note: The title of the book is House of Hades Could this mean ... NICO!!!! I think I would cry and hyperventilate if it's Nico's perspective! My heart wouldn't be able to take it. My undying love fascination of his character is just so deep, and I swear, I just want him to get out of that damned jar. Screw Team Percy or Team Jason, I'm Team Nico DiAngelo! I wanna date meet the Ghost King! Speaking of which, Nico better be okay and he better stay alive and Rick Riordan, don't you dare lay a finger on Nico! If you do, I swear, you better sleep with one eye open. Percabeth update: Rick has confirmed that Annabeth and Percy are alive. How they're doing though? No clue. But I expect a lot of romance cause what better place to spend time with your boyfriend than in hell ;) (view spoiler) [Direct quote from Rick: \"The one thing I can promise regarding \u201cThe House of Hades\u201d ***SPOILER ALERT**** At the end of \u201cMark of Athena\u201d, Nico senses that Percy and Annabeth are still alive, despite the incredible danger they are in. Nico is right. They are alive. You WILL find out what is happening to them in the next book. They don\u2019t disappear from the story. **** END SPOILER ALERT*****\" (hide spoiler) ] I'm honestly not sure if I want Percy and Annabeth's perspectives to be told. If I had to choose, I would want Nico (obviously), Leo (he's hilarious), Reyna (we have to know what's going on in the Roman side of things) and .... Maybe Jason? We haven't heard from him in a while and he is a main character. As much as I love Percy, I'm not sure if Rick will include his perspective again. I'd rather Percy's perspective be in the last book than in the second-to-last. Or maybe that's just me. On the romance department, I've lost so much respect for Jason. Playing both girls .. not cool. I don't know if I want him with Reyna anymore, I'm so conflicted. And the whole Leo/Hazel/Frank thing? UNDECIDED! There's so much romantic drama in these books now! ENOUGH WITH THE LOVE TRIANGLES! My most important request? I miss some of the old characters Rick. Whatever happened to Grover or Thalia or even Percy's mom? Bring them back ... please? Post some spoilers Rick!!!! Please, please, please, please! Or else (and I'm serious this time!) Cause a year is just too long to go without Percy EDIT! - November 13th Sorry to say this edit doesn't have any spoilers or upcoming information and things like that. But I have a real important thing to say ... Please do NOT rate the book already I know, you love Riordan. I know, all the other books were amazing! And I know this book will probably be no different but please save your 5-stars until the book has been released! There shouldn't be any ratings yet, pre-reviews are fine but ratings? Nah. Thanks :) EDIT! - April 5th Two important things I have to share with you today: Number 1) The cover art will be released on May 31st, 2013 So that means that this: While very pretty, is not the actual cover art but a fan-made cover . Why must you taunt me with this??? So excited to see it! Numero 2) THE RELEASE DATE FOR THIS BOOK IS OCTOBER 8TH, 2013!!!! Aww, the wait is so, very long. 6 months more ... EDIT! - April 11th WAIT - WHAT? So Rick, you mean to tell me that the fact that Aphrodite talked to Reyna, the fact that Jason felt wrong about Piper, the fact that Reyna was waiting for Jason to come back because she wants to be loved means absolutely nothing? You see, I wouldn't have had such a large problem with Jason and Piper if not for the inclusion of Reyna/Jason feels. If Riordan wanted to be Team Piper, why did he have to make us fall in love with the idea of Reyna and Jason? This is just cruel. On a happier note ... Could this mean ... DOES NICO HAVE A POV???? EDIT! - May 31st IT HAS A COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let's analyse shall we? So we can clearly see Annabeth and Percy on the cover - the first cover which features PERCABETH *cue fangirl screaming* Secondly, and I'm sure this has already been pointed out, why are those Doors of Death closed? They - they, can't be stuck in Tartaus!!!

EDIT: May, 2014 So... a confirmed Nico point of view for BoO... interesting... Contains House of Hades spoilers Ummm... so House of Hades was kind of epic. I'm just trying to figure out where to start here... how about IT WAS TOO FREAKING SHORT! So, it was almost 600 pages. And it was awesome, but I can't help feel that it still could have been longer. As many Tartarus chapters as there were, they were all short. And Piper o House of Hades Review: (Pre HoH release review near the bottom somwhere...) EDIT: May, 2014 So... a confirmed Nico point of view for BoO... interesting... Contains House of Hades spoilers Ummm... so House of Hades was kind of epic. I'm just trying to figure out where to start here... how about IT WAS TOO FREAKING SHORT! So, it was almost 600 pages. And it was awesome, but I can't help feel that it still could have been longer. As many Tartarus chapters as there were, they were all short. And Piper only got one section of chapters. Which, don't lie, was a pretty bad-A Khione confrontation. Speaking of POV's, I was really happy to see Frank again. He has such a subtle humor that I love. And the whole thing on the bridge, I just loved it. Another thing I loved ... HOLY CALYPSO! I got teary at the end of that part. It was so sad. I actually got the feeling that the two of them were perfect for each other. And the thing at the end of that part with the prophecy. It's all starting to come together! Even Jason was likable in this book. Though I don't like the pro-Camp Jupiter feeling I'm getting from Percy, Jason choosing Camp Half-Blood was a nice little twist! Well, not quiet a twist. We all knew he liked Camp Half-Blood better. And, come on, we all like Camp Half-Blood better. Jason was also a pretty good leader in this book. He's still not one of my favorites, but he kept everyone on track. I'm really starting to get that feeling that they are all a group. Hazel and Piper started getting along and Leo got Frank that fire-proof pouch. In Mark of Athena the seven (plus Nico) weren't really used to each other yet, but I think all of those problems were fixed in this book. They are all a much better team than they were in past books. And Percy and Annabeth were adorable. I mean, Percy only got to nap once the entire time, but it was all so perfect. And the pen writes in bronze, and Bob, and Small Bob, and that scene with the arai. I liked that Annabeth got a cool sword and the whole Tartarus being alive thing was terrifying. I also noticed that they used their delay tactic a lot in this book. Like, does anybody have any idea how many times someone stalls for time in this book? Not like I had problem with it, they are always hysterical when they delay. The tourist thing at the place of Night killed me. And then of course the next Jason chapter Frank picks up a tourist brochure. Also, I was so shocked that nobody died in this book. Rick had me so convinced that two people were gonna die. 1. Nico or Hazel 2. Leo or Jason I thought one person from each of these groups was going to go. He made me so certain that two of these four people weren't going to make it to see the epic last battle. Now if no one died in this book... how many are gonna die in the next one? And now on that wonderfully happy note I'm going toalk about... NICO. Oh my gosh, is it sad that I wasn't expecting this? I'm not one of those people who have a mega-fangirl crush on Nico, yet I still didn't see the signs earlier in the chapter. I guess I just expected it to be more of a brotherly Percy thing, but I'm actually totally okay with the way it turned out. It was important, but Rick didn't make a huge deal of it. I think it was done very nicely, actually. Also, Dear Rick, We all though it was weird in Mark of Athena when you said Nico had always had a huge crush on Annabeth. We know you planted it. Sincerely, I Knew I was Right And That That Never Happened. And how sneaky was it that he got rid of all the extra characters on that little \"save the camps\" quest. I was wondering why if there were only supposed to be seven demigods, what the heck were Nico and Reyna doing hanging around. But he fixed it, and he got rid of Coach Hedge, who's going to have a baby! Yay, Coach Hedge we all love you! This was also really a book of answering fans questions. We learned Reyna's full name, Annabeth's birthday, and if Percy's pen actually writes. He did a good job of packing all of our ridiculous questions into the book in normal ways. Way to go Rick! And how about that next title? Spooky right. I really like it. I just hope the cover isn't black, House of Hades is already dark enough that it would just look weird on my bookshelf. Oh, I'm sure the cover will be amazing as always. As much as I'm SO EXCITED for this next book, I don't know how I feel about Percy Jackson ending. I'm going to be really sad when it's all over, and just think, the end is only a year away... And did anyone else get that creepy Barnes and Noble exclusive map of Tartarus. It's really weird. Mark of Athena Review and pre-HoH release ranting Why did MoA have to end so sadly! I hardly ever cry. Even when I saw Titanic my eyes just got a little teary. But THIS! THIS was the saddest/sweetest/most heartbreaking thing I have ever experienced. Probably that ever existed. I was SOBBING! It was 1:30 am and I'm surprised I didn't wake up my whole family with the inhuman noises I was making. The only thing that made me feel (just a tiny bit) better was when Nico said that Percy was the best demigod ever and I was like: \"take that Jason!\" Don't get me wrong, I like Jason. Percy's just better. So yeah, my heart is broken. Forever. On a side note I hope that Nico is a POV in House of Hades [UPDATE: yes, guys I know that there will be no Nico POV, but when I made this review I did not know that because the information was not yet released, sorry for any confusion] . (anybody else notice Rick's pattern of the last few books. The_____ of _____ ?) Yes? NO? Also, would I be alone if I said that I think Leo is going to play a huge role in the end of the series? Just a guess. Also, I've read the last two chapters like 5 times already and might I say that they are equally as sad every time? The worst thing about the first time, though, was that it was SO unexpected. Annabeth trips and you're like \"Percy will save her!\" and the book's like \"lol no. They fall to their doom after a really cute moment.\" And then you're just like... (massive sob) \"THAT'S SO CUTE AND SAD WAHHHHHH\" in conclusion: I DID NOT EXPECT IT! def. his darkest (and one of his best) ones yet. Can't wait for House of Hades EEEEEEEP! Rick isn't too cruel so Percy and Annabeth will probably make it but it's still super sad. And to those of you telling Rick to write faster: I know! I don't want to wait either BUT considering that it takes some authors three years to write ONE book, he's actually pretty fast. AND would you rather him take his time and have it be AMAZING or have it come out earlier and SUCK because he didn't have any time? Exactly! I don't want to wait but we have to! And come on, you know the pain is actually really fun. It makes the book even better when you get it! Plus it gives us more time to enjoy the series AND we still have 2 years until the end... And it will all be over... And I'll have nothing to do............ UPDATE 11/26/12 *SPOILER* On Rick's blog it said that we WILL be hearing from Percy/Annabeth (my bet is on a Percy POV) in HoH and that in the end Nico can tell that they are alive. YAYAYAYAYAY UPDATE 5/31/13 WOW. The cover. WOW. It's so creepy I honestly cannot stop staring at it. They look like zombies! I love it! Also, has anyone seen the U.K. cover? I like how the U.S. and U.K. covers are always sort of similar. I think they want us to think certain things. Like the MoA cover, we all thought that Percy and Jason were going to fight because on BOTH covers it showed them in deceiving battle positions.. Now, the HoH covers show Annabeth and Percy in peril. I likes it. Also, guys. Seriously. Rick Riordan tweeted the link for the official unveil and on the link it said that the cover was a nice Percabeth moment. This means that, IT IS NOT NICO on the cover you guys. That sword is bronze NOT iron. Get a grip. Also, the whole 'NICE Percabeth moment thing' that I just mentioned means that Percy is not dragging Annabeth because he is possessed. I understand that you cannot see his eyes perfectly, but... guys. IT IS A DRAWING! Please forgive me, but I don't think that there is too much hidden in this cover. Yes, I agree it is weird that their clothes are messed up. I will give you credt on that because I don't know if it's spiderweb or prison clothes as some of you are suggesting or what. Another thing that I am unsure of is the weird river/path of souls or whatever that is on the bottom. So come up with whatever predictions you want on that, it will not bother me. But people... that is PERCY he is NOT POSSESSED, and to add a third thing I love Annabeth's hair. She is Rocking the hair ribbon. (totally relevant) Oh, and Leo... On the blurb/synopsis thing it said that Leo wondered how they were going to close the doors without someone staying behind and... I'm really scared! It said Leo wonders, LEO. would they mention JUST Leo if something bad wasn't going to happen! I'm sure though that if anyone dies Rick Riordan will do it right. Still, that will be a VERY emotional scene if it happens. One last thing! On the U.K. cover Annabeth has a knife. YES! At the end of MoA I was freaking out because her knife and laptop fell. I had hopes that they would find them in Tartarus. I am happy to say that with proof from the U.K. cover that they possibly will find them. Maybe. I'll probably be back for another update when we get the sneak preview in a few weeks. SO EXCITED! UPDATE 7/10/13 Last week the first chapter for The House of Hades was released to the public. I know that it took me a really long to update what I thought, but trust me. I read it as soon as I had the chance. This first bit of The House of Hades is in Hazel's point of view. I love every single characters in these books, and I'm glad that they are all getting equal chances to speak. The only reason that I have not talked about this chapter sooner is because I felt that there isn't much to say. It was fabulous and it set up the book for a ton of interesting things. What is Hazel going to have to do when they get to the doors? How much does Nico know? Yes, there are many crazy questions raised and, as I said, it is an amazing first chapter. There just isn't as much to question in it as there was for both The Son of Neptune and the Mark of Athena. Rick Riordan has done a great job as always and I cannot wait to read the rest of the book! P.S. What do you think book 5 might be called? I know that we won't find out until October, I was just wondering some of your opinions! ...more Okay, my full review atlast. My format of reviewing is just like i did in the previous book. My heart flutters when im reading this one because its the fourth book and i will have to wait for the final book! :D I am so excited what will happen to this series. Leo: He is so useful in this book! Hes so awesome. I ship him to Calypso by the way but i don't have faith much in this two, since Calypso is in her world. Piper: Im glad she is moving to help her friends. She is just like a distractible char Okay, my full review atlast. My format of reviewing is just like i did in the previous book.

Leo: He is so useful in this book! Hes so awesome. I ship him to Calypso by the way but i don't have faith much in this two, since Calypso is in her world. Piper: Im glad she is moving to help her friends. She is just like a distractible character in the previous books. But her fight with ice-gods are awesome although her relationship to Jason still didn't improved, oh Piper dear, i think you are in verge of hearbreak. Jason: Im glad he have a numerous POV in this book! not much to say to him but he is reaching out to his friends. Hazel&Frank: They are so cute! Such a matured couple. Percy&Annabeth: How could i forget this two? Drinking fire, getting help from Bob and Damasen, their love is so strong and i can't wait for book 5 for their happy ending. NICO: Okay, so his name is in caps and bold BECAUSE OF HIS REVELATION sakldjjsfhjsahfgdghjhhdfkghdksjadfhkjasgrf I CANNOT!! I DON'T EVEN HATE OR DISLIKE IT BECAUSE ITS GOOD JUST TO WAY IT IS!! Oh, wait.. Reyna - Shes so awkwared(well thats expected...) and im glad she is not like the other Roman demigods that are narrow-minded. Well, for the whole summary of my review, it is awesome. I can't wait for the book 5. :D ...more I've finished House of Hades!!! First of, let me tell you that the dedication page is CRAZY! It's like Rick derives pleasure from seeing us in pain. (view spoiler) [ ... (hide spoiler) ] I mean seriously? Do you have to rub it in? Argggh!!! Sigh. But let's face it. We still love Rick Riordan no matter how troll he is. Anyway, on to the book. Rick stepped up his game in the House of Hades. It wasn't all action, wherein there is one explosive thing then the scene shifts to another one. In the HOH, there a I've finished House of Hades!!! First of, let me tell you that the dedication page is CRAZY! It's like Rick derives pleasure from seeing us in pain. (view spoiler) [ ... (hide spoiler) ] I mean seriously? Do you have to rub it in? Argggh!!! Sigh. But let's face it. We still love Rick Riordan no matter how troll he is. Anyway, on to the book. Rick stepped up his game in the House of Hades. It wasn't all action, wherein there is one explosive thing then the scene shifts to another one. In the HOH, there are quiet moments where Rick lets his character grow and have more depth. During these moments the readers could know what kind of person a character truly is and I personally enjoyed these moments. Now I know what Jason really feels about being the golden boy. That he does not feel that perfect contrary to what the others perceive about him. I wasn't expecting it but I really liked Jason's chapters. He tries hard to build a rapport with his colleagues but unfortunately, he doesn't have the skills of Percy Jackson. I can see why others don't trust him that much. Jason is supposed to be looked up to because he's the leader, being the son of Jupiter and all. But can I share my problems with him? Can he be a friend and not just a ruler who only thinks for the good of the quest? Percy is a people person. Jason -- not so much. But hey, props to Jason for trying! Now I know that he can be a good friend. Also, I love that Jason and Percy are bros. (view spoiler) [(When he bear hugged Percy? Bromance overload!!!) (hide spoiler) ] Piper was much much less annoying this time. Maybe because she got only four chapters which is very fine with me lol. Piper is okay when she's not obsessing about Jason. She's actually pretty cool and kick ass, her charm being her most effective weapon. Leo ... I really wished that (view spoiler) [his romance with Calypso will be permanent. I mean it's about time he gets someone, a living creature, to love and will love him in return, not just his machines. Otherwise, that would be extremely lonely (hide spoiler) ] . He kind of matured in this book, no longer that silly, crazy demigod we all adored. Oh well, thats character development. Also, I like the Leo- Hazel friendship without the tension. Or maybe I just can't imagine Hazel being with anyone but Frank? Hazel 's powers have grown here. She learned how to (view spoiler) [use the mist and bend it to suit her needs (hide spoiler) ] , that's pretty much impressive. I like her new friendship with Leo, and her relationship with Frank became more stable. She bonded well with Piper too. I just wish that Nico would stop the self pity and realize that of all people, Hazel would accept him for who he is!! Anyway, Hazel has a huge part in finding the doors of death and can I just say that she really rocked (figuratively) the underground realm? It's like everything is possible when Hazel is in underground, (view spoiler) [she can even sort of teleport Leo, Percy and Annabeth! (hide spoiler) ] Anyway, I hope the whole we're-quite-scared-of-you-because-you're-a-child-of-pluto-and-youre-super-powerful business will stop. I mean, it's really not fair. What's with the voices inside Frank 's head? I still quite dont get it but okay.. Ares is just a troublesome, childish war god. End of story. I do like the fact that Ares is generous with giving his 'blessing' to his children. Remember when Clarisse killed the drakon and had a red aura around her or something? Yea, that happened to Frank too. But Frank has gotten some bonus points. (view spoiler) [His appearance changed! He became taller and less pudgy. In short, he became hot lol. (hide spoiler) ] and I think his promotion is right too since out of all the Romans among the seven, Frank is most roman of all. Heck, he even pins his centurion badge with everything he wears! Percy and Annabeth . Oh my heart is soooooo happy for these two. They've come so far! I really can't imagine one without the other. I think Annabeth was spot on: \u201cHer voice caught on the word friend. Percy was a lot more than that. Even boyfriend really didn\u2019t cover it. They\u2019d been through so much together, at this point Percy was part of her \u2013 a sometimes annoying part, sure, but definitely a part she could not live without.\u201d - Excerpt From: Rick, Riordan. \u201cThe House of Hades (Heroes of Olympus Book 4).\u201d Sigh. Their journey through Tartarus was one helluva ride. It's their darkest adventure yet, and I think they wouldn't have survived if not for (view spoiler) [Bob. Maybe Damasen too but mostly it's Bob who had been their rock (hide spoiler) ] . I don't know. For me the highlight of their trip to Tartarus is learning to give chance and to trust that even enemies could be great allies. Also by treating someone as a friend, even if it would be insane to do so, he would also treat you as a friend and will choose to be on your side even if it means betraying traditions. Wow. Since when did Rick Riordan's books make me so philosophical? Maybe it's just too much Annabeth. Not that I'm complaining. okay, Nico is not part of the 7 but im going to include a separate portion of my review for him. WARNING: The following might contain strong emotional outbursts. NICO was angry and miserable like I mentioned. Nico is freaking fourteen !!! he shouldn't be feeling these kinds of stuff. It will break him. I wish he would be given a friend who could understand him and give him advice. Then he will (view spoiler) [make up with Percy accepting the fact that hes just an older brother or something. (hide spoiler) ] Then he'll go somewhere to heal his broken heart while doing some important godly job. That would be awesome. And the scene when Annabeth held Percy's hand while saying good luck to nico? That moment, i wanted to snatch Percy's hand from Annabeth and give her my 'Don't-you-have-a-heart-glare'. Oh nico... Well not everything about Nico is pure drama. There was a scene when Nico was so cute I wanted to bring him home lol. (view spoiler) [When he was turned to a corn plant and when he returned to human and he said that he had a nightmare about popcorn? (hide spoiler) ] That was hilarious! I hope he had more scenes like that. So that's it. I LOVED IT. It may not be the same as the past series (PJO), not that silly and juvenile, but the characters became more real to me. Goods job Mr. Rick Riordan, as usual. Now book five (view spoiler) [Blood of Olympus. Wow that sounds scary (hide spoiler) ] , please please come a little faster? At least make it on the first week of October!!! I know the ending of the House of Hades (which I loved btw) isn't much of a cliffhanger, but I still want to know badly what will happen. ESPECIALLY ABOUT NICO!!! He's the most angry and miserable character I've ever met, Akhlys and he would make a fantastic, albeit desperate, pair. I want Nico to have a peace of mind, he deserves it. Please Nico stop being angry and let people love you because believe me, a lot of us fangirls really really have a massive crush on you. Oh my gosh this is such a good book!!! I hope Rick would write another Percy series after the Heroes of Olympus. I'm not ready to let Percy go. Earlier UPDATE! Oct 3, 2013: Look at this! http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by... ALL OF THE SEVEN are getting a POV in the House of Hades? I did NOT expect that, but YAY!!! But is my understanding of what he said correct? Sorry, I'm a little giddy I can't think straight lol. THE COVER: Percy and Annabeth are on the cover. Percy and Annabeth are on the cover. Percy and Annabeth are on the cover. It only means one thing. We'll be getting a POV from either of them! I'm guessing it would be Annabeth's. But oh dear, they don't look good in the picture. They look so beat up. But at least they are together. Together. Gosh that should be their.. um, tagline? Or slogan or whatever. I AM FREAKING EXCITED! EARLIER: I have a feeling we won't see Percy and Annabeth in this book. If it's possible, we will see them on the last chapters already. *sobs* (I have to qualify this. I think we won't see Percy and Annabeth's POVs here. We can only know what's happening to them thru demigod dreams and visions whatnot. I know, I know. This is unacceptable! Maybe Annabeth's POV will be included too? Since her POV was not included in TLH or SoN.) NEWSFLASH! I just read Riordan's blog and he wrote this: The one thing I can promise regarding The House of Hades ***SPOILER ALERT**** At the end of Mark of Athena, Nico senses that Percy and Annabeth are still alive, despite the incredible danger they are in. Nico is right. They are alive. You WILL find out what is happening to them in the next book. They don't disappear from the story. **** END SPOILER ALERT***** THAT'S FREAKING AWESOME GUYS!!! Whose POV we will be seeing? (view spoiler) [I think House of Hades would be told from Jason, Frank and Hazel's POV. Meh. (hide spoiler) ] I mean, I like Hazel and Frank with Leo joining the mix but Jason? No. I don't like him that much. Maybe I was influenced by Piper's POV on MoA, she being obsessed with Jason, as usual. Through Piper's eyes we saw Jason as too perfect. Um.. WHO WANTS PERFECT? Perfect is boring and not really believable, I mean there's a reason why most people root for the underdog right? Also she compared Jason to Percy, and I din't like her comparison. (view spoiler) [She thought Percy was unimpressive compared to Jason. (hide spoiler) ] At least I won't be seeing Piper's thoughts in this one. That's definitely a plus. Jasper fans, no hatin' please :D I just wish the love story won't be the main plot, it's too cuddly for my taste. LOL. Oh well, another year of waiting for the House of Hades. Until then, I should read MoA again and savor Percy and Annabeth's moments together. I won't be seeing them for a long time.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more See more reviews at YA Midnight Reads So the air was acid.

The water was misery. The ground was broken glass. Everything here was designed to hurt and kill. I have never been a fan of including gifs. in my reviews however The House of Hades, calls for some exception. Not only have I been dying for a year to read this, but also because right now, I'm a mess of emotions and words. I mean, I was already crying when my mum snagged a copy for me while I was at school the second the bookstore opened. And then I abandoned all my review books so I could read The House of Hades ASAP because... IT'S THE HOUSE OF HADES, DUH. Proceed onwards! Picking up from where the torturous The Mark of Athena left off, we have Hazel, Frank, Leo, Jason, Piper, Nico and Coach Hedge on the Argo II, on the way to meet Percy and Annabeth on the other side of The Doors of Death. However the task is not that simple, a war is brewing between the Greeks and Romans, Gaia is becoming stronger... and the Athena Parthenos needs to be in its rightful place. The House of Hades, second last book before the finale (which has been named The Blood of Olympus) has a little something for all types of readers. Action, mythology, humour, romance, sacrifices, war and monsters are all present. And, trust me people; you will not be disappointed--no matter how high your hopes were, no matter how excited you were, no matter how much of your body you would sell for this. No. Disappointments. YAYA! The House of Hades, has whopping 7 main characters and 2 sub-main characters. Crazy? Yes. It has always been my greatest concern that The House of Hades would make my brain hurt from attempting to distinguish apart such an ample number of personalities. Yet, I seriously love love loved the characters in this book. Percy, our hero since the beginning has never been more selfless and humorous. He may be kickass but he still has one big big heart--and a very funny personality. However I couldn't help but think that Bob the Titan, (yes, Bob is back!) was one of the more laughable characters here. Percy had a little less due to his situation, a.k.a in the deepest part of hell. Annabeth, wholly badass, full of hope and smart. Always with a plan. While Percy and Annabeth are in Tartarus, they face some of the biggest challenges and curses of their lives--their abilities are stretch to their maximum and above. And their romance was like THE SWEETEST EVER. I'll admit, their isn't as much as I was wishing for but Rick Riordan makes it the most realistic and every time they'd hold hands I was like Together, they make an ass-kicking team. Hazel was actually one of the more important ones in The House of Hades. I grew rather attached to her, she's so determined to save everyone, so full of heart, so determined. I really wanted to tackle hug her. Leo, our cool guy with plenty of cute arrogance. Frank, lots of character development in this one, our shy and unsure one. Coach Hedge, we go a little more into his history and still and get plenty of his love for killing and butchering. And Nico! OMG. My fictional crush <3 I did get heartbroken though. Heart. So. Broken. Into. Shreds. Piper and Jason... they were just meh. As usual. Not that they ruined my enjoyment of the book but I am just no fan. I do think, while Percy Jackson and the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus are full of fun and action, it's also been teaching me a lot of Greek Mythology and Roman Mythology along the way, in fact, I've become really interested in Greek Myths, and am planning to learn more about religion and mythology for my free electives at school which is exciting. I am so, so grateful to have read this series. Some books, you read and love but they may not teach you as much as this one. Rick's books come with the extra of some knowledge. If an author can teach a bit of Greek Myths while writing an attaching story, I do believe that all MG and YA readers so give this series a go. All in all, The House of Hades was no disappointment apart from the fact that I have to wait ANOTHER year for the sequel. *cries* ...more Oh, geez. Oh, wow. This. Me. Now.

That book was freaking amazing. The year wait was SO WORTH IT. Behold the actual dedicated page: \"To my wonderful readers: Sorry about that last cliff-hanger. Well, no not really. HAHAHAHA. But seriously, I love you guys.\" After reading that dedication page, I just died a little from the awesomeness that is Rick Riordan. You are officially my favorite author, the author who not only is able to transform a wonderful world of mythology into a gripping story that captures you from page one with wonderful characters that you all fall in love with, but an author who introduced me to the wonderful world of reading at the age of 10 with the Lightning Thief. So many things happen in this book that just completely blow me away. First, the character development. You would think with over 7 important characters all uniquely different, an author would have immense trouble really connecting and developing the characters. NOPE, not for Rick Riordan. Not only does he really go deep into intercharacter relationships and making sure you get to know them, he makes you fall in love with them. He makes you so emotionally invested in the characters that have you screaming in joy or gripping your book (or in my case, Nook) in terror out of fear something bad is going to happen to them. He has you sobbing into your pillow, he's that good. On top of that, every single character development has a purpose, one that contributes and drives the story forward. Holy Hades, Nico. DID NOT EXPECT THAT AT ALL. It completely changes your WHOLE PERSPECTIVE on him. I can't go in anymore without spoiling it. Hazel. I am going to be honest. When she was first introduced, she was honestly not one of my favorites. I was just like \"ehh...\" when I first met her. This book completely changes that. She becomes so awesome, not just personality wise, but power wise too. Best combination ever. Same goes for Frank. He got more awesome. I'll leave it at that. Leo. I finally feel like there is some kind of closure for Leo that has been eluding him for like the past 3 books. And his romance? (view spoiler) [I SHIP HIM AND CALYPSO SO HARD IT ISN'T EVEN FUNNY. (hide spoiler) ] The setting. Oh my Lord, the world building continues to be phenomenal. I think I have learned more about Greek mythology from the Percy Jackson series than like anywhere. What is so refreshing about this series is that Rick Riordan doesn't just make up random things to complement his stories. He uses ACTUAL GREEK AND ROMAN MYTHOLOGY and gives them a fun twist while keeping them factual. It's just amazing. The descriptions, just everything ugh, is perfect. I really don't know what else to say that can give props to this book's world building and setting. The plot is amazing, just in case you didn't know. It grips you, but Riordan's style of story telling just makes it impossible for the reader to like put the book down to go do work. But, Rick Riordan does something other than just create plot. He uses it as a mechanism to not just give characters meaningful growth, but the reader as well. The messages he peppers in makes you nod in appreciation. All in all, I recommend this book for everyone. I am not ashamed to say that I am a senior in high school geeking out and having feels and emotional attacks while reading them, and I also am not ashamed to say that I probably will keep doing that forever and ever even when I am an adult. The Percy Jackson series are amazing. Rick Riordan is amazing. This book is amazing. So go read it now. Fortunately, Rick Riordan does not end this book in a cliffhanger or I might have died. But, on a different note, I am also extremely sad and nostalgic that the next book will be the last in this series... and perhaps possibly the end of the era of Percy Jackson. But I am happy to announce that I am here for the journey and will relish every moment of it. Blood of Olympus, bring it on. Rick Riordan, I wait here im patiently for your next book in great eagerness and anticipation.

It was explicitly stated in SoN that he would die holding the stick in his hand, and it would be sooner rather then later. That implies that the stick is going to burn at some point in the series, right? Exactly, my friends. Exactly. Rick Riordan has drawn so much attention to this stick that he's basically painted it orange and waved it around like...I don't know, what do you call those things that people use to signal airplanes? Those things. Uncle Rick has been basically, flat out telling us that Frank has a stick, the stick is going to burn, and Frank is going to die. Forgive me if I find the fact that this is emphasized so much rather suspicious. Then again, Riordan could always pull a 180 and actually kill him. I could easily be wrong. 50 days to go! EDIT: COVERCOVERCOVERCOVERCOVERCOVERCOVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S SO PRETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ...He's going to kill off Leo isn't he. I mean, think about it, even though I'm a Leazel fan, I think it's pretty obvious that Frank and Hazel will end up together, and Percy and Annabeth...You know what, I think I'm just going to state survival percentages because I'm still in a coma from MOA and I need to straighten out my mind. So. Percy - 97% chance of survival. I doubt that Uncle Rick would kill him off (permanently). He's Percy after all. Annabeth - 93% chance of survival. Percy and Annabeth are the main characters, this is (supossedly) a childrens book, and besides, I just really think they're both going to live. It's the other characters I'm worried about... Jason and Piper - 85% chance of survival each. I think they're more likely to die then Percy and Annabeth, but less likely then everyone else. To be honest, I don't care for them that much. Moving on. Hazel - 70% chance of survival. She's already died once. Killing her off again would be extremely cruel. Then again, her being alive is sort of stretching the rules of nature a little bit... Frank - 55% chance of survival. I mean, his life depends on a stick, folks. He's very vulnerable. However, I do think he's more likely to live than Leo, just because, well, he's obviously the easiest to kill. It would be a just a teensy bit...predictable. Nico - I would say it's 50/50 here. And so we come to my poor baby: Leo. Who I'm only giving a 30% probability of surviving, much as it breaks my heart to think about it. Why? Several reasons. 1. The fortune cookie. I am not convinced that Percy and Annabeth falling into Tartarus was the price. When Leo thought to himself that they had been the price he'd paid, I was thinking \"Are you sure about that Leo? Are you sure ?\" I'm not sure. It seems to me that it would be very Rick-like to make us think that the price has been paid but it hasn't. 2. The whole Frank-Hazel-Leo love triangle extravaganza. I have a sneaking suspiscion that Hazel will have to go back to the underworld and someone is going to take her place. Or Frank and Hazel will end up together and Leo will just randomly die. Or... 3. Let us all remember that it was Leo who reflected that someone who had to close the doors from the Tartarus side would be stuck there. This makes me worried. A side note: I wonder, have we really discovered all there is to the Sammy thing? I am convinced that somehow, some part of Sammy's soul is in Leo. NOTHING SHALL DISSUADE ME. However, all this aside, I doubt that any of the seven will die until the last book. So, yeah. Probably this book will end with Gaia awakening and everything looking very grim for our heros (especially one or two of them...) But look on the bright side! We don't have to wait two years! Only one. We can do it guys!!!!!! (maybe) Edit: October 8? Well, at least it's not the exact same week as the last Divergent book, but still probably same bookstore trip... I sense impending doom.

Additionally, since then I've also read the 5th book in the series, and the two kind of get mixed up in my head. But I will try not to get them confused.) Ah yes, don't you love it when your author literally ends a book by dumping your favorite characters straight into hell? Well, that's exactly what Rick Riordan did in Mark of Athena , the precedent to The House of Hades . This fourth installment in the series finds Annabeth and Percy trapped in Tartarus and trying to escape. Meanwhile, the other demigods are trying to fight through Gaea's forces and seal the doors of death. Well, having now finished this whole series I can say this is one of the strongest of them. I think part of my enjoyment is that it focuses more on characters from the original Percy Jackson series\u2013\u2013mainly Percy, Annabeth, and Nico. My sweet babies. <3 There are a lot of Percabeth feels in this book. Goodness gracious, so many. I know I've gushed about this in reviews of the previous books but, they're just such a great couple. I love that they need each other without being completely dependent on one another. They have their own distinct personalities and histories, they're both kickass in their unique ways \u2026 and they're just perfect. I love them. And in this book, we really get to see how strong their bond is and how much they've grown. And Nico\u2013\u2013Nicoooo! *Mild spoilers* So, I'm sure pretty much everyone knows what the big bombshell about Nico is in this book (and if I recall correctly, the information was leaked before the book even came out) but \u2026 yeah, so. Nico is gay! And that's so awesome! Not only because there was finally some LBGT representation in this series, but also, I felt like it made a lot of sense. I don't know if Riordan knew this from the beginning, but regardless, it really works. And I love it. And I love Nico. As for the other characters/demigods, I like them too\u2013\u2013well, for the most part. I looove Leo. A lot. Hazel and Frank are both cool, too. I have to say I'm not a huge fan of Piper or Jason and they're both kinda Mary-Sue-ish, but \u2026 you know, they're fine. Still, I felt like there was good character development in this book and we get to know all the characters more. I liked Riordan's portrayal of Tartarus and all the obstacles Percy and Annabeth have to face. It's definitely intense and scary, but still with that whacky Riordan flair. And over all, it's a very exciting story. Like all of Riordan's other books, there's a lot going on and it never slows down. For a book that was a huge brick, it didn't feel very long because it all went by so quickly. The Final Word: Love this series, love the book, love the author. Good stuff. ~ Flying Kick-a-pow!

I mean come on! -Percy and Annabeth should meet some monster in Tartarus that decides it wants to fight with the gods and it should help them get out. this is way out there but it would be cool -Percy should have a little sister that he never knew about that is Roman. this is also out there but it would be SO STINKIN COOL! -Annabeth should find her dagger. It's so important! she always has her dagger! and her hat needs to be fixed too.

It demands everything from you\u2014especially the truth. Only then does it yield rewards. This book is H.E.A.R.T.B.R.E.A.K.I.N.G. Like STOMP-ON-MY-HEART-IT-WILL-BE-LESS-PAINFUL-THAN-BREAKING-MY-HEART-INTO-PIECES. I didn't except Rick Riordan to raise his level of angsty situations to a whole different level. But he did it. And i loved it (oh my god i am a M). STORY : After that nasty cliffhanger where our two heroes, Annabeth and Percy, fell into Tartarus - this story got it's creepyness level to another darker level. How will Annabeth and Percy survive in a place which traumatized even son of Hades, Nico? Camp Jupiter (full of bloodthirsty teenagers [which is so damn scary]) is advancing to attack camp Half Blood and there is no one who can stop it. And if they do start a war, there will be bloodshed and many will die. Unless our heroes return Athena's statue to its rightful place. But first - our heroes must rescue Percabeth from the depths of Tartarus and close the Doors of Death in House of Hades. ( i really laughed so much when they went to Croatia, omfg, lololololol,i mean wow,my country is like so damn close omg, and Leo's comments about town Split are priceless ) CHARACTERS : What this book really succeed with is advanced character development - all of the characters were level-uped if i could say it like that. May contain some minor spoilers! \u2666 Frank got stronger, more sure in himself and in his abilites, even though his personality is still conflicted with his heritage. He will always be peaceful soul, but when it comes to protecting the people he loves, he will let all hell lose, even if it means becoming someone else. \u2666 Hazel became flawless character in my eyes. She is damn brave - like seriously brave. I also loved how she cared for Nico (when obviously no one else does, except for...Jason) and also she loves Frank with all of her heart and would do anything for him. She accepted who she is and she is fighting with all she has. Of all things, she wants to prove herself too! \u2666 Jason - i didn't really love him from the start, he seemed kind of stand by character, but now he had changed and i love it how he accepted other people (even when he was distrustful before toward them - especially to Nico, after he learned about him - he became supportive pillar for Nico). He wants to become better, he wants to change things - especially camp Jupiter. He accepted his Greek side more than his Roman side, and even though he was a rule follower, he wants to change them, even if it means breaking them. I seriously started to love him more in this book than ever before. \u2666 Piper got most of her chara-developement in the previous book (though she kicked some butts in the second half of this book). I didn't like her so much before (like with Jason), but now i do, she is interesting and she tries her best to help. \u2666 Leo gets some serious character developement here - because he falls in love. Yes, that is right - in love! (with (view spoiler) [ Calypso (with whom he argued for a long time,omfg) (hide spoiler) ] ). And it changes him - because all he needed was love - and to be accepted. Sure, he did made some mistakes, but worst of all, he always felt alone because no one was there for him (at least according to him), he felt like seventh wheel all the time, an useless guy who can't do anything right. But now he has changed and i love the change and i need him to have a happy ending of sorts! \u2666 Annabeth & Percy (cause i can't describe them seperately). I have to say their relationship is basically and practically true love. I mean, it was cemented the moment Percy decided to fall along with Annabeth to Tartarus so she wont be alone. He could have saved himself, but he didn't. He chose to stay with her and be with her until the end. First he gave up his immortality to be with her, and now he damned himself - only to be with her. \u201cAnnabeth pressed her lips to Percy\u2019s ear. \u201cI love you.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure he could hear her\u2014but if they died, she wanted those to be her last words.\u201d But...as they went through Tartarus, they are faced with many dangers and many twisted feelings. They are slowly changing and those changes are much more darker than they wanted. Especially Percy. He would do anything for Annabeth, but sometimes he lost control and almost became what he didn't want (for Annabeth to be afraid of him like when Percy almost (view spoiler) [ killed Misery with her own poison (hide spoiler) ] ....). \u2666 Nico : i believe this boy needs a character development award. It was completely unexpected and it shocked me. I would never call Nico heartless or unemotional, cause he is oposite. He just hides his pain well - and after this book, i totally understand him. He believes no one will accept him - so he hides himself. His creepiness is his self-defense - because he doesn't want to be hurt. He believes that no one cares about him (not even Percy and Annabeth), but he cares about them all, and that is what hurts him [he just cannot comprehend that people care about him too]... and i believe that this saying(?) describes him the most: \"The loneliest people are the kindest\". Tell him, <---C>Nico di Angelo</---C>, Cupid said. Tell him you are a coward, afraid of yourself and your feelings. Tell him the real reason you ran from Camp Half-Blood, and why you are always alone. Will you hide among the dead, as you always do? Cupid taunted. Some serious spoilers about Nico: (view spoiler) [He loves Percy - so what? The worst thing of all is that HE KNOWS Percy will never love him the same way. And for someone from 1940ties, those kinds of feelings were unacceptable and he is scared of that too. Nico knelt and picked it up. He regarded Jason, as if waiting for an attack. \u201cIf the others found out\u2014\u201d \u201cIf the others found out,\u201d Jason said, \u201cyou\u2019d have that many more people to back you up, and to unleash the fury of the gods on anybody who gives you trouble.\u201d I think Riordan made the right choice of choosing this path for Nico... There are so many kids who don't know what to do with their feelings - it will help them to realize that they are not alone - like Nico (who still thinks he is alone, but Jason tries his best to help him and be his friend + Hazel who wont stop worrying about him). Wait,let me start over again: I believe the reason is this: because there are many people who actually feel like nico, they are afraid of their feelings - and they are afraid to show it and it eats them inside. Some of them think of it as its really serious and i dont mean on boys who think they are that way cause it's \"time of change\". Just imagine how people felt when the gay rights didnt even exist they all felt like Nico, because it was \"unnatural\" to them as much as it was for people beside them. So they thought if they confessed how they truly feel, they will eventually get abandoned. And that is exactly how Nico feels.Also, Nico is one of the most popular characters of PJO universe, and having him presented in that way may show people that there are actually people who feel same as them. And also, just read this: cause it is so true .

The Lost Hero started with Jason as the narrator. That makes sense... I mean, he's the lost hero, obviously. The Son of Neptune started with Percy. Duh, he's the son of Poseidon/Neptune. That makes sense. The Mark of Athena started with Annabeth. Annabeth is the daughter of Athena, and the quest and all, blah blah bla WARNING! Don't read if haven't read Mark Of Athena yet.

So that's that. Nico isn't only going to have a point of view, his point of view is going to be FIRST. :D yup. I'm happy. And I think the cover is probably going to show either Nico being all in command and stuff lookin for the Doors of Death, or Annabeth and Percy running from a bunch of monsters in Tartarus. Both sound pretty epic. November 30th. Edit: I just had another thought... What if Annabeth and Percy AREN'T part of the seven? What if its Nico and someone else? Maybe Percy and Annabeth fell into Tartarus for a reason. So that Nico and that someone else could come in... If so, who is this mysterious person? A girl, most likely. Reyna? No, I don't think... Rachel? No, she isn't a half blood. Besides, she's a oracle. There's got to be some rule against oracles going on quests or whatever. No, not her. Thalia? Nah, she's a huntress. She has her own stuff to take care of. Clarisse? Doubt it. Maybe it's someone who is yet to be introduced to us. Who knows? Maybe a girlfriend for Leo or Nico. Edit! November 8th. AHHH! I just had a thought... An oath to keep with a final breath... What if... Nico promised Percy to meet them on the other side... What if when Percy and Annabeth make it to the Doors of Death, and Nico and the others are there.. What if Nico closes the doors? NICOO!!! Nico is my 2nd favorite character!! Don't make him diee Rick!! WAIT! Everyone thinks that was what the line of the prophecy meant, and then BOOM! In the last book Nico shows up alive and well, and saves the day! What do ya thing? To unrealistic? *sigh* PERCY!! ANNABETHH!!!! NOOOOOOO!!! Why? WHYYYYY? Ugh. Is it weird that Percy falling into Tartarus just makes me love him more? HE SO AWESOMEE!! Once upon a time... My life was boring. THEN I read the Percy Jackson and the olympian series. Then it was over... THENNNN I found out about the book, The Lost Hero! I quickly bought this book and read it, and the first time I saw Percys name in it, I just read it ten times to make sure it was really there. THENN! The Son of Neptune came out. When I opened the cover and saw Percys name, in big bold letters... So beautiful... And now The Mark of Athena. I gobbled it up, like any other Percy Jackson related book. And now thats over too. T_T Luckily theres still two more books in the series. But when they`re done... I don`t know what I`ll do... T_T But I`ll be two years older then... Maybe I would`ve grown up and out of this Percy Jackson craze. Nah, probably not... PERCYYYYY!!! First of all, I would like to say, RICK RIORDAN IF YOU DARE MAKE PERCY DIE I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND FORCE THAT BOOK DOWN YOUR THROAT!!! Anywho. I have a feeling that two of the seven will die. Those two are Frank and Hazel. Franks life depends on a burnt peice of wood, And Hazel, shes not supposed to be alive anyway. I know, its incredibly sad. But, hey, at least its not Percy! Yeah... I`m obsessed. I HATE LOVE TRIANGLES! Hazel and Leo and Frank should just all figure it out. Personally, I like Leo best. But Frank and Hazel were toghether first, so. I dunno. Piper is incredibly annoying. I could`ve strangled her when she compared Jason to Percy. And then after her comparison she thought that Jason was better looking! I mean, thats like describing a peice of bacon and a celery stick! Jason is the celery stick, and Percy is the bacon. OF COURSE YOU`RE GOING TO PICK THE BACON! Then, she picks the celery because it SOOOOO obvious that the celery is better. -_- Stupid girl. My favorite parts in the book...? When the ship is attacked by dolphin pirates. And Percys like \"Oh no! Franks turning into a crazy dolphin!\" Percy points at where Franks hiding. \"I SAID, Franks turning into a crazy dolphin!!\" Oh Percy, where do you come up with these things? And when Percy, Frank, and coach Hedge go to that water aquarium thing, and Percy and Frank are stuck in the tank, Frank turned into a koi fish, and lifted his fin up. Sup? I laughed hysterically at this part. I don't know why. XD Maybe cause I was reading late into the night, and I was really tired. *Sigh* I wish I didn't have to wait so long... But then again, it takes time to write something so amazing. Now, I'm gonna say something... It should probably be unsaid, but I'm going to say it anyway... If Percy does die -IF IF IFFF- I think that the gods would give him another chance to become an immortal god. I mean, they offered it to him in The Last Olympian, they might again when Percy dies... Although, Percy as a god wouldn't be any fun. Percy is so lovable because of his flaws. He's perfectly imperfect. Plus, what would that mean for Percy and Annabeth? .... *Deep, long, and depressing sigh* I'm going to reread all the Percy Jackson books now... BYYEEEEE. EDIT! November 5th. Is that the official cover? *HYPERVENTILATES* ...more I am literally crying right now. WHY RICK WHY!?!?! Just finished reading MoA for the 3rd time in as many days, and I can officially say I am sobbing with both joy and sadness. The book was amazing, and beautiful. But now it's time to start psyching myself out about the House of Hades, or HoH. Predictions ( as of October 4, 2012) 1- Percy and Annabeth will live, but they will come out worse for wear. I'm not sure what will happen to them, but Nico's description of Tartarus really scared me. While P I am literally crying right now. WHY RICK WHY!?!?!

I'm not sure what will happen to them, but Nico's description of Tartarus really scared me. While Percy is admittedly a *stronger* demigod than Nico, Nico sees things that can be a lot more creepy and scary. Not to say Percy hasn't had his share of horrifying experiences, but Nico literally LIVES WITH THE DEAD. If he is shattered by what he saw in Tartarus, I can't imagine what Percy and Annabeth will be going through. 2- If we do see Percy and Annabeth before the last three or four chapters, it won't be a positive scene. They will probally get, like a chapter, and it will show Annabeth succumbing to the horrors of Tartarus and Percy panicking or something like that. Then, at the end of the book, they'll pop up and be like \"surprise!!\" 3- The Doors of Death will be closed at the end of this book. There is still a book left, but there is still Gaea herself to fight. That has to be a book on its own, right? 4- Gaea officially wakes up at the end of the book (hi, cliffhanger #4). 5- The Romans reach CHB, and halfway through the battle, something happens that makes them all realize that they are being idiots and that they should be on a plane/boat to Greece to actually help solve the problem, rather than making things worse. I'm guessing this wakeup call will probally come in the form of some sort of message from the gods. 6- The Frank/Hazel/Leo triangle will have some sort of resolution. 7- Frank and Nico (along with others) are narrators at some point in time. I really want to see inside Nico's brain. 8- Giants will be fought. There are still, what, 6 to 7 giants to go? And they all have to be defeated in 2 books? Looks like people are going to be busy. 9- The gods, in some way, actually join the conflict. It really bothers me that they, thousands of years old parents, are letting their 13-17 year old kids do all the dangerous stuff for them. Get over the schizophrenia, convince your kids in the US to stop fighting, and take some responsibility. ...more Buy this book on AMAZON or buy this book on BookDepository with FREE WORLDWIDE SHIIPPING I just finished reading this title.

Never again.\" Only then did she understand what would happen. A one-way trip. A very had fall. \"As long as we're together,\" she said.\" She heard Nico and Hazel still screaming for help. She saw the sunlight far, far above-maybe the last sunlight she would ever see. Then Percy let go of his tiny ledge, and together, holding hands, he and Annabeth fell into the endless darkness.

Going into this book I had a lot of expectations, and I was pretty much a mixture of anxiety, fear, and excitement. I couldn't wait to start but I also didn't want to finish for fear of what might happen to the characters I loved so much. Needless to say, all of my expectations were met and then some. There were twists and turns around every corner and there was never a dull moment. Tons of percabeth cuteness ensued, as did action-packed adventures, high stakes, and plenty of monster fighting. Pretty much everything you expect from Rick Riordan and more. I love Riordan's writing style. It's got just the right mixture of comic relief along with darkness and suspense. In Mark of Athena, the writing style kind of bounced back and forth between humorous and a bit darker, which I loved. It does the same here, but Riordan also settles into a kind of consistency that he didn't have in Mark of Athena, which made this an even better read, if possible. As for the character development, I've always thought Riordan was very good at making lifelike characters and giving them plenty of development, but oh my gods in this book he did much more than just that. The development of the characters was insane. They all changed so much and I think each character shines through, even the ones who aren't my favorite *cough*Jason and Piper*cough*, and they're all really coming into their own. The characters with the most development by far were Nico and Leo, who are two of my favorite characters. They each have a lot of twists and turns as far as their personalities go and I feel like they both really grew in this book. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say one of Nico's secrets comes to light and I really didn't expect it. It was probably one of the biggest turns in the story. The plot was very well-done. The drama, action, and humor, along with character friendships and relationships really balanced each other out. Yay for friendship! Okay, so if you've ever talked to me about this series then you know I just want friendship, friendship, and more friendship. And while this book was very well centered around Percabeth, my favorite couple in the series, it also had a lot of friendship and loyalty between the other characters, developing fun relationships and starting to trust each other more, which was probably one of my favorite things about this book. The action was very well-written and not over the top, as always. There were a lot of emotional scenes in this book as well, which gave me feels galore. I can't say much more than that without spoiling something and since a lot of people I know don't have this book yet, I don't want to spoil anything. Fans of Rick Riordan should read this book. (Like you have a choice. All of his fans are trapped in a vortex of feels, pain, and obsession by now.) ...more \u201cYou cannot control your parentage, but you can choose your legacy\u201d As always, Rick Riordan doesn't disappoint.

Loved it! But holyyy craaappp I am SO nervous for Blood of Olympus!! Creo que de todos los libros de esta serie, este es el que mas me ha llegado al coraz\u00f3n por el lado del amor entre los personajes. Las aventuras, las batallas, la mitolog\u00eda, las risas, la tensi\u00f3n y las lagrimas; estuvieron presentes como en todos los libros de Rick. Ya solo me falta un libro para terminar esta saga y tengo muchos sentimientos encontrados, no me quiero despedir de estos personajes, no me siento preparada para dejar de leer a Percy.

Anyways, the ending made me stand up in the middle of Home Ec (I shouldn't have been reading in the first place.) and scream, \"MR. RIORDAN, I WILL FIND YOU!\" Thank Heavens my teacher reads, or that would've been one awkward parent teacher conference. It was one of the cutest moments ever in the The Heroes of Olympus books I have read yet. And it made me scream my anger at a fruitcake. As long as I'm here, let's complain about some characters, too. Piper- She was the one I had the most problem with. Let's just say that when you see a pretty girl pretending to be ugly, you want to slap her in that pretty little face of hers because you are NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BE CLASSIFIED AS SLIGHTLY PRETTY. YOU ARE DOWNRIGHT UGLY. Take a deep breath, Brooke. Back on track. Leo was awesome. I loved Annabeth's description of Frank as a panda bear. His reaction to finding Percy and Annabeth cuddling in the morning was hilarious. Hazel was a little too young to date. Dang. I did it again. Did I mention that I am the same age as Hazel? In some books I hold grudges againtst characters under fifteen. Then I think, \"Fudge. I'm such a hypocrite.\" Annnnd I'm jumping around. Gleeson Hedge. Gleeson. Hedge. Let's ignore that name, ok? He was... Violent, to put it gently. How many know that his place was attacked by a giant evil badger? High five if you know! I really love this series, and I can't wait for the next book to come out. But two words, Mr. Riordan. Write faster. ...more \u201cTell the sun and stars hello for me.\u201d My favorite in the series!!

House of Hades is the fourth book in the Heroes of Olympus series. The book is one that contains a point of view from each character of the infamous seven. It picks up basically instantly after (view spoiler) [Percy and Annabeth fall into Tartarus. (hide spoiler) ] We begin with Hazel's point of view as the remaining group face an attack on the ship during their voyage to Greece. The perspectives of Jason, Piper, Frank, Leo and Hazel all allow for that journey in description, giving us the thoughts of each character during their dangerous trip to Greece and to the Doors of Death. Annabeth and Percy's points of view (view spoiler) [describe their journey through Tartarus and their mission to reach the Doors of Death, (hide spoiler) ] chapters which I personally preferred compared to the Greece trip. I may be biased in my love for both Percy and Annabeth though. Our characters, in the order they feature in. The chapter segregation in this book aren't as polished as the previous three in the series. They're random and give you ever perspective of the seven and their reactions to the events unfolding. I did eventually work out a pattern though: you get a few chapters of the characters who are travelling to Greece and then a few from either Percy or Annabeth. Like I have for all the books in this series, here's a deconstruction of my thoughts of the characters involved: Hazel , daughter of Pluto, is an extremely important character in this particular book. Sure, she'd had some important parts to play aka coming back from the death when she had died in 1940, having liked Leo's great-grandfather who he looks like, being the only one able to call the fastest horse and now, she can control Mist! I realise this is a massive spoiler in some cases, but I'm too lazy to mark it. Hazel is definitely one of my favourites in the group. I find her funny with her old timey ways and just a beautiful character. I tend to forget her age and just picture her as a 16 year old (I mean technically she's like 70 or something but reality is she's 13). Annabeth , daughter of Athena, is obviously my favourite and I will never stop declaring my love for Annabeth - who, in my opinion, is the Hermione Granger of this series. During hers and Percy's trip (view spoiler) [ - ha, trip - (hide spoiler) ] in (view spoiler) [Tartarus (hide spoiler) ] she has to use her wits to keep the pair alive. Of course, without her it is likely Percy would have died in his first hour. I ALSO JUST WANNA SAY; (view spoiler) [how bloody sad is it that Annabeth lost both Daedalus's laptop AND the bronze dagger which Luke had given her all those years ago when she fell into Tartarus?! (hide spoiler) ] Very much made me want to cry. Leo , son of Hephaestus, and a character - in my opinion - that seems to be only useful for the character relief. Don't get me wrong, I love Leo! He's amusing. It just seemed like Rick has placed him as a scapegoat in some ways, and the (view spoiler) [Calypso (hide spoiler) ] was just ridiculous in my own opinion. I didn't bother reading those parts. I also want to mention how annoying it got that he blamed himself for what happened to Percy and Annabeth. His interaction with the monkey dwarfs? I can't remember their name oops, was hilarious. Percy , son of Poseidon, is wandering through (view spoiler) [Tartarus (hide spoiler) ] with Annabeth for the majority of the book. The pair are on a mission to close the Doors of Death and are also struggling to survive the harsh conditions of the environment they are in. Percy continues his sense of humour through his monologue and continually makes sure to keep Annabeth's hopes up during the trek. He's constantly there to reassure her and that warms my Percabeth trash of a heart. Frank , son of Mars, changes a lot this book. Physically I mean, he's still our baby mentally. He learns to accept that he's a child of war and embrace what that means. Deciding he doesn't want to be what he classifies as \"useless\" to the group. Especially when with Hazel and Nico on a mini quest that featured in the book. I will always love Frank, he's just a super big teddy bear and it warms my heart. Though, I wish Rick hadn't had him go through a physical transformation such as he did. I didn't think it was necessary and we could have kept our chubby and baby faced Frank. Jason , son of Jupiter, doesn't do a whole lot in the book in my opinion so I haven't got much to say. I know that he's annoying if that's any constitution? I really don't have much to say apart from the fact I loved the way he treated Nico. It warmed my heart despite the fact I'm not the biggest Jason fan. Piper , daughter of Aphrodite, is a character I remain to hate. I don't care that she took on a goddess one-on-one in this book. Nor do I care that she tries to redeem herself. She doesn't in my books considering how overbearingly annoying she was in the books she has appeared in. Piper is a character I doubt I will like again and I know for a fact that if she was real I would probably avoid her like the plague on steroids. I can write more but I have conducted way too many rants on her in my reviews and she is no longer worth the finger exercise. I also want to do a shoutout to Nico , Coach Hedge and Bob the Titan for being absolutely incredible side characters who I would have preferred to read about in some cases. I had my problems with this book, obviously. The problems centred primarily around Jason and Piper, I will admit. I just don't like them. They're characters I feel have been forced upon us as readers and we are meant to love them because they are \"a golden couple\". I just can't deal with it. I tried to mention my dislikes in each of the characters little things I did, except Percy and Annabeth because I'm not even ashamed of my preference for the pair. I think what made this re-read more painful for me in reading the other perspectives was I remembered this book perfectly. I can't remember what unfolds in the next book, but I remembered each event clear as day for House of Hades and that got slightly tiresome. Though, I do enjoy some of the friendships and relationships. I love Hazel and Frank on top of Annabeth and Percy. Frank and Leo are also my brotp of the century. Overall, House of Hades was an interesting re-read. I love experiencing the adventures of the characters though the writing always does feel like it's lacking something with the third person point of view. Though, anything Rick writes will be high up in my list of recommendations. ...more The series is getting more exciting one by one. Good to know about the roman sides of Cupid, Big Bob and Small Bob were entertaining and and the same time they got my sympathy. Percy and Annabeth's journey was more interesting than anything else. I'm liking Annabeth more and more. I can't wait to read Blood of Olympus.", "Title": "The House of Hades"},
