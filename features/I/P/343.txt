But it is clear to me why Melina Marchetta's third tribute to YA literature received a Printz award back in 2009. It is because it is excellent, to the very meaning of the word. If all YA contemporary writers wrote like Marchetta, I doubt I'd play in any other genre playground very often. She writes these beautifully inspirational, relatable, and emotionally-charged novels that seem to affect me in an undescribable way. Some of the passages in Jellicoe Road seem to beat with their own heart: \"These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\" \"'What do you want from me?' he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.\" I've always believed that an exceptionally good writer can take you places emotionally that others can't, and,<---M> for me</---M>, Melina Marchetta is one of those writers. I'm going to end this review here for two reasons: 1) I believe this is the type of book that should be experienced first hand, without much knowledge of the story going in. So, go read it and remember, the beginning is confusing, but plow through it and I promise you won't regret it; 2) I'm tearing up thinking about this story and its characters, so all you'll be getting from me is the aforesaid and this: I love this book and I'm anticipating the day when I can read it again. I highly recommend Jellicoe Road to everyone. Oh, and one more thing: I \u2665 Jonah Griggs. ...more There's a monster in my mirror with puffy bloodshot eyes because she stayed up most of the night, crying and reading <+++>On the Jellicoe Road</+++> .<---F> But it was worth it</---F>.

But it was worth it. Melina Marchetta never fails to remind me why she is one of my favourite authors and, in my opinion, this is the best of her books I've read so far. It's very difficult to put into words how I feel about On the Jellicoe Road , all I can say is that my heart has been ripped out and shredded, my throat has sealed up with emotion and when I finally get some sleep, I get the feeling I'll probably dream about Jonah Griggs. The story is of <---C>Taylor Markham</---C>, a girl who was abandoned by her mother as a young child and now resides in a boarding school for kids who are troubled, neglected or criminally inclined, her closest friend and mentor being Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. Taylor is elected as a leader in the territory war games played by her school with the Townies (locals) and Cadets. She tries to balance this responsibility with her own worries about Hannah's sudden disappearance and her belief that it is connected to her own mother. On top of that is Jonah Griggs, one of the Cadets and a boy from her past, who knows her a little too much for comfort. The biggest concern of mine is that the intended young adult audience may not fully appreciate Melina Marchetta , I know she's somewhat of a celebrity here on goodreads but she's hardly a household name... and it irks me. I want to tell everyone to read this, scream praise from rooftops, and glare with disapproval at the teens in my local library until they drop Halo and pick up these fantastic works of fiction. But it makes me sad that Melina Marchetta is probably too sophisticated a writer for the Twilight generation. Saving Francesca , The Piper's Son , On the Jellicoe Road ... every book I read seems better than the last. She creates moods that permeate the entire book so even the most simplistic scenes or conversations become deeply emotional, and Melina Marchetta plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar. I can't think of a single book that has had me choked up more often than this one. And Jonah Griggs, you stole my heart. Though I do think Melina Marchetta could quite easily persuade me to fall in love with a goldfish. Basically this book is everything... beautiful, powerful, tragic without being melodramatic, and I know this wonderfully sad story will stay with me for a very long time. ...more i have got to stop being surprised when teen fiction is good. printz-award winning fiction (you know, the award for literary teen fiction that all the grown-ups read and say \"this is for teens ??\"). australian teen fiction. complicated, multi-layered teen fiction. this book is all of the above, and it is remarkable. it has sex and drugs and rock and roll, it has violence and terrible crimes, it has shock and awe and guilt and terrible secrets and it opens with a death. this is my kind of teen ficti i have got to stop being surprised when teen fiction is good. printz-award winning fiction (you know, the award for literary teen fiction that all the grown-ups read and say \"this is for teens ??\"). australian teen fiction. complicated, multi-layered teen fiction. this book is all of the above, and it is remarkable. it has sex and drugs and rock and roll, it has violence and terrible crimes, it has shock and awe and guilt and terrible secrets and it opens with a death. this is my kind of teen fiction. it is mostly about loss and being lost, and being so close to redemption but frustratingly denied. it is about the teen-girl default position of lashing out like a wild animal and of the deepest regrets. it howls. it is astonishing - jellicoe road is sophisticated both in its subject matter and the way in which the story is told. it actually took me a little while to get into the swing of things - whose story is italicized? what is their relationship to the rest of the story?? but it was a good kind of lost - the kind of lost where you are in an interesting part of town with attractive people and cute little knickknack shops, not the kind of lost where you are late to a job interview in the wrong goddamned borough. and toward the middle, the plot became a little predictable, but that didn't even matter, because by that point i was so enmeshed in these characters' lives - i just wanted everything to work out for them, even though i knew this was not going to be the kind of book with a tidy-sweet ending. she created powerfully three-dimensional characters that i cared about and hated to close the book on. truly - it has been a while since i have fought sleep. i love sleep - i neeeed sleep. but i forced myself awake to keep reading this, and when i finally had to give in, it was with the deepest resentment. this is a rich and emotionally complicated tale, and when i go to that panel next week, i may have to throw myself on her a little bit and beg her to take me with her and tell me bedtime stories every night. for posterity, i will announce here that i did not cry. but this is definitely a crying-type of book for those of you that way inclined. i got that throat-thing that happens before a good cry, which is unusual enough for me, but i expect you people will cry like when a puppy dies on your birthday. and you will love every minute of it.

But it's really brilliantly done -- because that is exactly what the main character, Taylor Markham, thinks of things. It's busy and there are plot threads everywhere and all I knew was that I loved SAVING FRANCESCA and Melina Marchetta was doing all of this for a reason. And she was. It ties up beautifully in the end, and there's a scene which even made me shed a tear -- me, who has not cried since THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (three tears) and while writing my second novel SHIVER (one tear from each eye) -- and I'm left feeling just about cheerful about everything in the book though it was not a Hollywood happy ending by any stretch. I think quite possibly my absolute favorite thing that Marchetta does is the character reversal. She introduces a character which we view in a terrible light because the main character views them in a terrible light, and then she completely changes our mind about them in a subtle and realistic way throughout the book until finally we and the main character are in love. She did this in SAVING FRANCESCA and she pulled it off again in JELLICOE ROAD even though I was watching for it . By the time we get the first kiss in the novel, I was sort of clapping embarrassingly like a seal. This is one of those books that I know will be wonderful on the reread, because I'll get to look past the busy beginning to see the groundwork Marchetta was laying. Happy sigh. I'm very happy this one won the Printz this year. ***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read.

Jellicoe Road definitely falls into this last \"made-me-weep\" category. Jellicoe Road is the location of a boarding school for kids that are often neglected or with criminal tendencies. Taylor Markham is residing in the school because her mother had abandoned her at the age of 11 at a nearby 7-Eleven. Now Taylor is 17 and unexpectedly selected to be the school's leader in the game of territory wars with the Townies (locals from a tiny neighboring town) and Cadets (who spend several weeks a year in the Australian wilderness). Taylor is not sure she can handle the responsibility. She is uneasy more than ever - her mentor and friend Hannah disappears and Taylor is sure it has something to do with her mother; Jonah Griggs, a Cadet who she has a shared past with, is back and seems to know her all too well; she is plagued by dreams of a young boy who attempts to tell her something. What follows is Taylor's journey through the past and present to uncover the reasons why and how she was abandoned by her mother. As always, it is hard for me to explain what I like about a 5-star book, but I'll try. Melina Marchetta draws characters that are deep, complex, and real. The relationships among them are touching - more than anything I think, this book is about the power of friendship and, boy, there are some magnificent examples of friendship in this book! The book is also about grief, guilt, forgiveness and, of course, love. If I am forced to point out any flaws in this book, I'd say the writing some might find confusing in the beginning. It takes a few pages to figure out what is a dream and what is a page from a story Taylor is reading; what is from present and what is from the past. But soon enough all pieces of the puzzle fall together and you are faced with a deep, meaningful and heartbreaking story. Another thing that might bother readers is that some characters go through a lot of tragic events, sometimes too many. However, the story never becomes overly melodramatic or emotionally manipulative IMO. Jellicoe Road is a remarkable work of YA fiction and rightfully deserves the Printz award it was given in 2009. I have no doubt I will read Marchetta's books in future. ...more \" I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12 - Jesus, did you? \" This quote belongs to Stephen King, but it describes the soul of Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road perfectly.

It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love. \" Here's a short spoiler-free synopsis: Taylor Markham was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at age eleven. She is now 17, living in Jellicoe School, a boarding school full of state wards and troubled children. She is in charge of her House (50 girls) and is expected to lead a sixteen-year-old 'territory war' between the Jellicoe School kids, the 'Townies' and the Cadets who camp out in the area for a couple of months each year. All while having strange dreams and feeling abandoned by her caretaker Hannah. All while reading Hannah's unfinished novel about five teenagers in the 1980s who form very intense friendship bonds after the horrific car accident on Jellicoe Road when they were 11-12 years old. Now, I have to say that not once did I look at this book as a mystery even though it's marketed as such. The central mystery of the story - well, I easily figured it out only a few chapters in, and the rest of the details easily came into light as the story developed. Not much took me by surprise; it was quite predictable, actually . But since the mystery was not why I enjoyed the story, the reading experience was perfectly fine. To use the book's own language, the whole mystery setup was not a trip but a journey. It was never about the resolution but about the emotional journey it took to get there. \" I remember asking, \"What is the difference between a trip and a journey?\" and my father said, \"Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,\" and that was the last thing he ever said. \" What I loved was the friendships that the 'old five' and the 'new five' have developed throughout the course of their respective stories. My favorite by far was between Taylor and Raffaela, with the developing friendship with annoying but adorable Jessa as a close second. Even though there was a romantic story threatening to take the foreground, it never overshadowed the rest of the story and the friendships , and I'm thankful for that. \" This is the best night of my life,\" Raffy says, crying. \"Raffy, half our House has burnt down,\" I say wearily. \"We don't have a kitchen.\" \"Why do you always have to be so pessimistic?\" she asks. \"We can double up in our rooms and have a barbecue every night like the Cadets.\" Silently I vow to keep Raffy around for the rest of my life. \" I was quite emotionally affected (I'd say 'manipulated' if not for the negative connotation of that word) by the nostalgic atmosphere Marchetta creates here . The nostalgia for the beauty of childhood and adolescence, for the friendships of the kind that you can only have before you reach adulthood, for the safety of childhood (no matter how messed up it can be), for the safe haven of Jellicoe School for the lost and messed up children. I also loved Marchetta's excellent characterization . Her characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional, and feel quite real. That is not to say that there's no stereotyping or clich\u00e9s, but those are kept to the minimum. \" These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking. \" As for the voice of the novel - it is very emotional. Please be warned - it is emotional with the generous helping of teen angst. Oh, teen angst! It's on every page, in every sentence - just like it was so overwhelming when you were 16-17. Everything is intense, the tension is palpable, emotions are right on the surface. Reading this book is like experiencing being a teenager you once were. I found it to be a bit of eye-rolling experience initially (thankfully, I'm way out of the adolescence) but eventually the style grew on me and started to feel quite organic. But if you'd rather not deal with overexaggerrated raw teenage emotions - well, be warned and stay away from this story. \" What do you want from me?\" he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More. \" ------------------------------ Now, here are the issues that I had with this book that forced me to knock off a star: - The Territory wars. I thought that storyline was limping on both feet. Why all the intensity if the whole thing only takes place for about 2 months each year? Why the whole issue with the Club House when it's only a few weeks when it becomes relevant? Honestly, just setting up a rivalry between the 'factions' would have been enough for the story. (view spoiler) [Especially since about halfway through the story any of that territory stuff becomes completely irrelevant as nobody pays any attention to it anymore (hide spoiler) ] . - Sometimes the emotional intensity slips into a blatant melodrama. I mean, there was actually a remark on (view spoiler) [how intense Taylor and Jonah's relationship was, which made me feel like I'm reading a Twilight-type love story (hide spoiler) ] . - The adults in this book (even Taylor remarks on it!). Seriously, what the hell is going on with the adults? (view spoiler) [Hannah and Jude, I'm looking at you! You and your minimal interference into the lives of the children of your best friends! And what's with keeping the parentage of Jessa and Taylor secret? Especially Taylor? I know Hannah promised Tate to not 'mother' Taylor, but what exactly was the reason why she could not tell the abandoned girl that she, Hannah, is her paternal aunt? How would it have hurt Taylor to know that????? (hide spoiler) ] - Taylor and Jonah: (view spoiler) [unprotected sex? Not cool. I'm a gynecologist, and I pay attention to these things, and neither Taylor nor Jonah seem to be at the point in their lives when they seem ready to have a kid - which can happen. STDs are also not cool, you know? Chlamydia is not a joke! I wish Melina Marchetta included a condom-buying scene. It may dampen the mood, but would have provided protection and a nod of approval from this Ob/Gyn doc. (hide spoiler) ] And yet, despite my adulthood, despite a few eye-rolls, despite the issues that I describe above, I STILL teared up at the end. I think admitting that will TOTALLY ruin my street cred , but oh well.

And I'm not sure I ever want to get out of the abyss of emotions and just plain rawness this book snared out of me. And it's not like there's some blatant, profound message here that's changed my life. It's not like I hadn't already started to pin the pieces of the puzzle early on for myself. It's the sheer beauty and mastery with which Miss Marchetta constructs this tiny little world and its complex characters who don't feel like characters at all because that's how deep in you are. It's that constant air of enigma and enchantment , that underlying presence of hope mixed with tragedy that draws you in so very thoroughly; all presented without the need for tasteless dramatics, maudlin behavior or overattention to romance. When you can manage making my heart feel so passionately for a person who only exists in whisps of memories throughout the entire course of a novel, I salute you. To me, reading this book felt like a journey . An experience in and of itself. And quite frankly, the first time, in a long time, that I've been taken away to that far away place we all go to with the simple power of words.

Gorgeous... Books like this make me realize just how insignificant words become when attempting to convey raw emotion. On the Jellicoe Road is more than just a book; it is a hauntingly beautiful journey towards an unexpected destination where tragedy and despair become the bridges to the greatest of friendships. And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die. This story is told in alternating perspectives of both the past and present which, at first, seem entirely unrelated. But as this mysterious plot unravels, it begins to show hints of their glorious connection. If you find yourself confused or frustrated in the beginning, don't give up; you are strategically been fed only pieces to a larger puzzle that will fit wonderfully together in the end. The character development in this story is extraordinary; \u00a0no one is denied the sweetness of redemption and transformation. Seventeen year old Taylor Markham has been living on the Jellicoe Road after being abandoned by her mother at a 7-11. The school she attends partakes in traditional games of territory wars where Taylor eventually becomes a leader. Taylor is tormented by the grief and uncertainty of her abandonment and keeps herself emotionally distant from others. She has few memories of her childhood, but when her history starts presenting itself, she begins a relentless quest for answers. The impeccable writing in this story is captivating as it methodically flows from one vivid scene to the next. Taylor's character, as broken as she appears, is actually quite funny in a dry and witty, sarcastic sense- which is my favorite type of humor. I appreciated being able to smile and laugh in the midst of such emotional situations. Her love interest, Jonah, is equally broken and initially comes off arrogant and crude. As their relationship develops, it not only becomes one of the most loving, but also one of the most inspiring. Being part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything. Every single element and occurrence in this book is connected to some larger piece of the story. Everything. Most connections are so prominent that they take your breath away, but then there are some as subtle as a whisper, and if you're not careful enough you just might miss them. I was still making these subtle but important connections even after the book was done. The way the author seamlessly executes this perfect union of all that exists from past and present is astonishing. Important messages of hope, love, and determination tugged at me endlessly while reading this book. \u00a0I cried...and cried. From sadness, yes, but the most blinding tears formed from being so deeply moved and so humbly inspired. \"Hold my hand because I might disappear.\" Book Stats: \u25aa\t Genre/Category: Young Adult \u25aa\t Steam Caliber: Clean \u25aa Romance: Beautiful love story involved, but not sole focus. \u25aa\t Characters: Complex, well-developed, lovable. \u25aa\t Plot: Uniquely focused on tragic events forming powerful friendships.

I know that\u2019s not a radical thing to do because I know a lot of people who do similar things, and as I read this novel I found myself writing down questions that I believed would be answered at the end. Most of them were and everything made sense, but there were two questions that I had that I really wanted to know the answers to. The answers wouldn't really add anything to the story... I'm just nosey. Not that I\u2019m hankering after a sequel because this book was perfect on its own and I think a sequel would be pointless, but I feel like I need to sit Ms Marchetta down and ask her my questions just for some closure. So, if you\u2019re ever in Manchester MM, there\u2019s a caffeinated drink on me! Heroine. I loved loved loved Taylor Markham and from the first page I knew that she was going to be a part of the League of Soul Sisters (along with Vera, Katniss (don\u2019t mention Mockingjay), Viola and The Rat) that I am considering setting up. I\u2019m going to be the \u2018funny one\u2019 in this group, obviously, because I lack the coolness, wit, feistiness and the ability to throw a ball in a straight line never mind shoot an arrow. Taylor was the perfect mix of disgruntled moody teenager, spunky heroine and confused young girl. Yes, she can teeter on the edge of being a bitch but I think that\u2019s what I liked about her. She\u2019s flawed and she\u2019s normal and she\u2019s trying to deal with so much I practically encouraged her to be a bit prickly. YA fiction is so full of impossibly perfect heroines that make it so hard to relate to. But I really related to Taylor and her outlook on life and in the time it took me to read this book, I found myself really caring about what happened to her. And I think that\u2019s why a lot of people really love this book. So yeah, Taylor, keep your eye out for the postman because there's an official invitation in the post for you... Love Interest. Oh Jonah. When I heard you described by many a girl as the mysterious loner with a dark and tortured past, I have to admit that alarm bells were going off. There\u2019s something about the word \u2018mysterious\u2019 and 'loner' when used to describing boys that triggers an alarming adverse reaction in me (lots of frowning, yawning, skipping of pages, eye-rolling, eye-clawing-out etc). But you, Jonah Griggs, you are my kind of guy and you are allowed your dark and tortured past. I don\u2019t want to say a lot on this subject because if you haven\u2019t read it already then you need to experience JG first hand. But this guy brings the swoon and I have to agree with Taylor on one thing (well, on most things, but this one in particular)\u2026 I prefer him in his fatigues. BOOM. Also an honourable mention has to go to Santangelo, with his abs (don\u2019t worry Taylor, I wouldn\u2019t look away either) and Ben, my violinist and his medieval jousting. Hot damn. Theme Tune . Local Boy in the Photograph - Stereophonics. I immediately thought of this song... not just the subject matter but the whole message of the lyrics. Bitter sweet. Angst Scale. 9/10. I really don\u2019t want to say anything in this department for fear of spoiling things. But my favourite part of this book was the way past events were interwoven with the present day and how they affected the characters. I found these passages that were filled with innocence, hope, lost youth, impossible situations and, most importantly, the power of best friends so beautiful and captivating. Recommended For. EVERYONE. People who love mystery books. People who are comfortable with having butterflies in their stomach permanent because when JG brings the swoon\u2026 sorry, I\u2019ll stop. People who like kick-ass, resourceful and perfectly complex heroines. People who love beautifully written and fantastically paced prose. People who wish they were younger again so they could have adventures in the best tree house in the world\u2026 complete with espresso.

Quite possibly, my favorite book of the year , because it is so unique and so gut-wrenching and so enrapturing it deserves the title. This book is not merely a reading experience; this book is a journey . One filled with two emotional plotlines, past and present, that overlap in places only to thread themselves together in a masterful and sad, yet agonizingly beautiful story. This book is about finding yourself. About hating the world and cursing the universe for forcing you to exist when you're left abandoned by everyone else. About your whole life being a question mark. And about finally opening up to the world and embracing it to the fullest. \u201cHold my hand because I might disappear.\u201d This book is about love, every kind of love. The one between siblings. The one that's so intense it's everything to you and leaves you dying when that love suddenly stops. The one that's as natural as breathing. The one that you try to bury beneath excuses. And about the love for life, for living, despite it continuously trying to shove you down. \u201cIt's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\u201d This book is about the ugliness of humanity. About serial killers. About drug addiction. About neglected children. About pedophilia and child pornography. About goddamn cancer. About abuse. About suicide. About car accidents. About being parentless. About loss and about death. \u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201d But, I believe, most importantly, this book is about friendships. I cannot find the words to describe how amazing the friendships portrayed in this novel are. They just filled me up with immense joy and plastered smiles on my face and gave me a sense of family. With their banter, their bromance, their love for mischief, their leadership, their honesty, their support for one another and their endless, boundless, eternal love. Also, this book is about clever and magical storytelling. About how an author can enthrall you with some words on a page and make you cry like you lost someone dear to you. About how she can twist your heart and make you curse out loud for (fictional) live being so unfair. About how she can give you goosebumps and butterflies in your stomach and sighs and accelerated heartbeats. And this book is about me and how I have fallen in love with its every single character. I love Taylor. I love Jonah. I love Santangelo. I love Raffy. I love Ben. I love Jessa. I love Trini. I even love Chloe P. and Richard and Sam. And I adore Webb and Narnie and Tate and Fitz and Jude. They were the backbone of this book, its essence, its soul. And oh, Fitz, I just want to hug the poor precious boy. And oh, Narnie, I just want to destroy her numbness. And oh, Tate, I just want to hold her hand and be there for her. And oh, Jude, I just want to save him from the heartache. And oh, Webb, I just want to place him in the sky between the stars where he belongs because he is perfection. After I finished reading at 5AM, I kept asking myself: Why haven't I read this sooner? How much can a single person cry in one night? How much can you love a book? What to do with my life now? And so here I am, begging you to read this book if you haven't done so yet. Let it be a journey for you. \u201cYou just have to belong. Long to be.\u201d I'll go back to my sobbing now, thank you. ...more GAZILLION STARS. 179 books. And this is just the second one. I cried.

Not only because you're overwhelmed by the story but also because you can only understand the riveting milieu of it if you read it. But I couldn't just leave this blank because that would be callous and cruel of me. So I challenge that if I'm able to convince myself with my review ( and that my friend, is a ginormous IF) I'll consider myself to be truly worthy of expressing my feelings over this book. This magnificence here is not a story, no. It's a rainbow, all it's elements infuse, coalesce into what makes it truly beautiful. Just like how the individual colors may look beautiful in a certain particular nuance but as a whole the rainbow emanates probity and pulchritude like a contented sigh from the firmament. You know that moment when you just sit there staring at off nothing and thinking of everything, sometimes at night when you can't sleep ? That's what it was with me, those few times, with my iPad on my lap, not quite a respite but a reprieve from the maelstrom of emotions that rose from the book. But not quite a reprieve either. As for the characters and the writing, it's, Melina Marchetta . Need I say anything more ? Lemme get one thing clear, The story is confusing for the first half. It takes time to get into the story and may make one feel perfunctory and slightly out of the loop, like you know, visiting your old friends and seeing them together, talking about things they share and you no longer do. Like that. But if you cop out because of it, it just shows that you don't deserve this story. It's not yours. And I'm on cloud nine right now that I'm not one of them. But then, it is haunting in the second, not the ghastly kind of haunting, the sinuous kind of haunting that follows you, enervates you and makes you forget that time and the rest of the world exist. When the obfuscated truth hits you squarely on the chest at the end, that feeling is devastating. Devastatingly beautiful. Breathtakingly beautiful. Achingly Beautiful. Beautiful. Just like that. You might be wondering why I'm so profound and poetic ? Because that's the only way I can do justice to my thoughts, to my feelings and most importantly, this book. ...more Simply incredible.

There are some books which are virtually impossible to explain, and this is one of them. The GR book summary gives no indication what the book is really about, and truth be told, I'm not sure you'd want to know what the book is about before reading it. The first 150 pages or so are completely frustrating and confusing. I knew this ahead of time, but I also knew that just about every single person who has read this has said the exact same thing, yet still gave the book 5 stars. There is a reason for this. The first part of the book is only giving you glimpses of the player's lives and their world. It almost reminded me of one of those movies that you watch in reverse, where the ending is the beginning and the beginning is the end - yet not quite. All I can do is echo the voices of those who prodded me to read the book - DON'T GIVE UP. You will not forget this book. You will not regret reading. It is so worth the read. Keep some tissues handy. As the story unfolds, the author starts giving us a crumb of information, then another, then another. Slowly the pieces of a broken story come together as one revelation follows another in a wave - a very emotional wave at that. Just when you think you've heard it all, more starts to come. Then more, then more. Pay attention to every single character. Just about every person's life is intertwined with the other characters in this story. I'm done trying to prod you to read this. Just read it. You will not be sorry for making the effort. Please, I beg you...battle through the first part of the book (which is confusing) until you get to the part that starts to get into your soul. Let's call this a dare.

I hate On The Jellicoe Road. I hate books that make me cry, and this book made me want to weep tears of blood for all that lost youth and promise, and the pain of loss and the promise of the future. If somebody had told me how mixed-up and emotional this book was going to make me feel, I would have abandoned it in a corner and floated off to the simple uncomplicated world of supernatural ass-kicking, where nobody dies and even if they do, they rarely stay dead. In the big debate of Saving Francesca versus Jellicoe Road, I would have to pick Jellicoe Road. I liked Francesca better, but that's because it made me laugh and think and smile mistily, but it never, ever, shoved me into the wringer and brought me out feeling like a limp dishcloth. It never made me feel that piercing tender pain you get when you think of things long past that can never be regained. It never made me feel like I was drowning in the lives of people who are so real, it's hard to believe they don't exist and haven't consumed your life. Jellicoe Road is a harsher, deeper read, the sandpaper to Francesca's paint peeler. Undeniably, the writing is brilliant. It's evocative and tender, it makes the emotions in each page almost tangible. The characters are drawn brilliantly too, and despite the fact that over half of the main cast wants to kill themselves at one point or the other, you cannot help but be drawn to them. I loved Taylor and Griggs and Santangelo and Raffy, but my heart got well and truly tangled up with Narnie and Webb and Judd and Tate and Fitz. It's for them that my heart broke, and shattered into a million pieces. The story is told largely from the perspective of Taylor, but it is the ghosts that predominate, that breathe life into the story, ironic as that sounds. This is not a book for people who want a straightforward love story with a dash of drama. This is for people who want to appreciate good writing, and don't mind losing a little bit of themselves between the covers of a book in the process. Oh man, this book is just so seriously Fucked. Up. And I would so totally KILL anyone who dissed it. Ever. ...more You gut me, Marchetta. Absolutely gut me. A lot of people think that Henry David Thoreau* went to Walden to live a solitary life. I felt like that until I actually went to Walden Pond. Imagine my surprise when some friends and I decided to go for a hike, go for a swim and check out the scenery--we left Boston around 9...and we got there by 9:30. Yeah right, HDT, I could live deliberately in the woods, too, if I knew my transcendentalist cronies would bring me a Cinnabon and some pumpkin ale once in awhile.** Nevertheless, Thoreau\u2019s idea A lot of people think that Henry David Thoreau* went to Walden to live a solitary life. I felt like that until I actually went to Walden Pond. Imagine my surprise when some friends and I decided to go for a hike, go for a swim and check out the scenery--we left Boston around 9...and we got there by 9:30. Yeah right, HDT, I could live deliberately in the woods, too, if I knew my transcendentalist cronies would bring me a Cinnabon and some pumpkin ale once in awhile.** Nevertheless, Thoreau\u2019s idea served as the inspiration for Yeats\u2019 poem Lake Isle of Innisfree *** from which Melina Marchetta quotes in this novel. Yeats, who looks a little like Kenneth from 30 Rock , wrote about Innisfree because, to him, it served as an idyllic place where he could always go for peace and solitude. (I find it rather amusing that both Thoreau and Yeats wrote fascinating works about livin\u2019 la vida simple that become so popular. Lesson: If you find a perfect place, KEEP IT TO YOURSELF)But Marchetta's magnificent storytelling was only enhanced by her reference to Yeats' poem. Instead of pounding quotations into your head, like a sad number of authors do, Marchetta only mentioned Innisfree once in passing...but it stuck with me through the rest of the book. I don\u2019t want to go into the plot of this book too deeply, for the point I took away from the book is that we all have those idyllic places we go to in our minds. For some of the characters in this novel, their Innisfree was with family, or with their childhood friends, or even just spending time with one particular person. It doesn't have to be a place at all. No matter how far we get away from those memories, they are always all polished up in our minds like the Hope Diamond when we need to imagine a perfect place in time. Marchetta\u2019s characters, as usual, were intriguing and fleshed out. It is constantly amazing to me that I can read a book and be unable to visualize even the protagonist, while this author is able to give me an extensive cast of characters and I feel like each one of them is someone I know. From Santangelo to Griggs to Raffy to the Brigadier, I understood where they were coming from and could reasonable predict what they would do in a situation. Very rarely was I frustrated with choices that characters made. (view spoiler) [Though I wish Hannah and Jude got together earlier and that they had raised Taylor as mother and father. To deprive her of a childhood that could\u2019ve been better than it was out of loyalty to Tate was, though perhaps understandable, still frustrating. Same for Jessa. (hide spoiler) ] I also have no idea how Marchetta can make my heart hurt one moment and make me hysterically laugh the next. I must admit that the territory war aspect of the novel was not my favorite, though I understand its place in the overall story. (view spoiler) [When it all comes to a close, I wonder if next year\u2019s students, Townies, and cadets will see fit to just share the area? (hide spoiler) ] The transfer back and forth between Taylor's present day and Hannah's story was rough for the first fourth or so of the book. If you try it and get stuck, please truck through it--it is so worth it. As I knock each of Melina Marchetta \u2019s book off my to-be-read stack, I am a little more sad. When I\u2019m done with them, how long will I have to wait for a new one? *The Wikipedia entry for HDT informs me that he wore a \u201cneckbeard\u201d for many years and insisted many women found it attractive. 1) I never knew that hideousness had a name; and 2) If you are a woman that finds a neckbeard attractive and we are friends on here, just go ahead and defriend me. **He was only 1.5 miles from his homeboy Emerson\u2019s house. ***This poem is the shit.

You find that reading it a second time offers you a whole other reading experience. Those once slow 100 pages now whiz you by, and you realise it was not the pace that was at fault, but your confusion. You savour it so much more. Make sense of certain references - crush on the plot, characters and writing, and fall in love with Jonah Griggs all over again. It frustrates me so much to know that I can never do this book justice. That so many readers out there have yet to read this beauty. The thing is, somehow, even though I knew what was going to happen, I choked up and laughed like a mad women at the exact same scenes I did the first time around. What made me smile at times was how the little tissues were still there. So many times I would be about to bookmark a certain moment only to realise that it was already bookmarked. I suppose I know myself too well ;) When I approached the last 100 pages I decided to read them outside in the garden. I have never had that urge before, but It was dark outside, silent and soothing in a way that I couldn't imagine it being inside. It felt right to read those last pages alone - in a peaceful surrounding. Yet, like last time, I dreaded that last page, and when it had ended - I closed the book and just allowed my thoughts to take over and savour them, because I knew it would be a long time before any other book would ever make me feel like this again. I took that moment to mourn characters and a world I genuinely felt I had lost - taking some solace in the fact that I would return to them when the feeling of loss became close to unbearable. You know, I can see myself reading this every year, discovering something new every time, loving the characters even more - if that's even possible. Once again I was left with this undeniable ache that made me want to be a part of these characters lives, but I think what bothered me the most, and what really made me feel somewhat of a loss, was knowing that I will never know a Tate, Hannah, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Jonah, Ben, Raffy, Chaz, Jessa, and Taylor. I feel like I'm saying goodbye to something personal every time I turn over that last page, but now I know that's hardly the case. LOVE does not even come close to describing what I feel for this book Treasure it guys And then read it all over again <3 ...more It took me 113 days to write a full review.. I counted.

Seriously, this woman is one of the most creative people alive, one of the most amazing writers I came across and I wish I could put into words the awesomeness of this book, but I feel at a loss for words once more. In fact, I should invent a new language with a dictionary full of ways to praise her talent. Because Melina Marchetta doesn\u2019t only write books, she creates entire worlds full of fleshed-out characters and shattering emotions, and after you read about them you feel like you\u2019re the luckiest person in the known Universe and beyond. Because not many people in this world are able to feel what she makes you feel, and not many authors get to create such strong connections between the characters and the reader. I feel like her stories have a soul. Like her characters are living beings trappend into a fantasy world, waiting for us to come and listen to their stories. They seem to breathe through our emotions, and I don\u2019t remember a moment when I didn\u2019t feel something (deep) towards this story and these wonderful characters. Her words sing to me, they reach into the deep core of my own soul, they make me laugh through tears, they break my heart into thousand pieces but they also put it back in together, making it beat in a whole new rhythm, making it love and ache on a different level. Once again, the complexity of the plot left me lightheaded, in awe, even though I knew what was coming my way. It\u2019s been a while since the last time I read this book and I felt it all all over again: the confusion, the despair, the hope, the heartbreak, the happiness. My teary eyes could barely read and I was left breathless too many times to count. I loved EVERYTHING about this book, after all this time it is still my favorite story and I really hope that when (and if) you read this book you will be able to feel just a tiny-tiny part off all these blissful emotions flowing through my heart right now. THE STORY: How much heartbreak can a heart take? Jellicoe road is a roller coaster, a story meant to break hearts \u2013 one about true friendship and love, about forgiveness and salvation, about hope and disappointment, about life and death and everything in between. It simply left me in awe again because there is no tiny detail, there is nothing less important in this story. Everything has value, all words have power \u2013 to make you laugh or cry, to dream and hope.. and the real beauty of it is connecting all the threads in this fabulous piece of art. But as heartbreaking and intense as it might be, it is also fun, and I found myself smiling more than once. So don\u2019t go thinking that this is a depressing book, it is not; it has the perfect balance between joy and sadness, between delight and heartbreak \u2013 but don\u2019t believe me, see it for yourself! THE CHARACTERS: I can\u2019t put into words how much compassion I felt towards the characters in this story. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one that didn\u2019t leave an impression on me. Some times they made me laugh (even through tears), some other I just wanted to hold them close to my heart and protect them from all the hurt in their lives. CONCLUSION: Every time I read \u201cOn the Jellicoe Road\u201d it simply takes my breath away. I fall in love with this book all over again, it hits me full strength no matter how well I think I know the story, it makes me smile and cry and sometimes both in the same time, all while I get drunk on the beauty of Marchetta\u2019s words.

This book, Jellicoe Road by an Australian novelist, Melina Marchetta is our book of the month and we will have our face-to-face book discussion on Saturday. As a moderator and one of the senior members of the group, some members ask me what I think of the book. Even if they don't say or admit it, my views influence some of them. At this point, I guess my job is to encourage them to read the book and join the actual book discussion. That's why even if I did not like this book, I cannot rate this with 1 star. Why I did not like this book? 1. I cannot understand why the first 100 pages should be made confusing 2. The claim or fight for territory has nothing to do with the rest of the book. Also, I do not understand exactly how it is supposed to work. 3. The love affair between Taylor and Briggs is too mushy for my taste. Felt like Katniss-Peeta or Bella-Edward. I'm too old for that. 4. Taylor is a pathetic female character IMO. 5. Taylor is asked to lead even if she is asthmatic. Is there nobody else who can lead? Anyway, according to my trusted friends in this group, the book is amazing. Maybe they are still young and the story \"speaks\" to them. So, let's leave it at that. However, I can say that this book has a good intent. It also has a developed story that other readers can emphatize with. I guess that this is just not for me. But it is my ardent desire that this book will influence our North Korean friend to back off in his evil plan of building nuclear arsenal in the side of the world. Stop your expansionist plan, please and be content on what you have. Then if you have to test nukes, please don't point it to the Philippines! See, we also love Melina Marchetta! See, we both read and enjoy this book! Thanks for lending me this book, Aaron. ...more So I just don't get what others love about this book. It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon. I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very So I just don't get what others love about this book. It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon. I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end. There are two plot lines - 1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it\u2019s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets. 2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School \u2013 Taylor\u2019s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about \u2013 mainly the story of her mother and father. In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn\u2019t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor\u2019s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she\u2019s drowning a cat with her bare hands. There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn\u2019t touch me. They were just part of the confusion. Will someone please, please tell me what they LOVE about this book and what makes it a multiple award winner? Is something wrong with my logic? ...more I\u2019m at a loss for words. This book has made me cry and laugh out loud. It has made me fall in love with its characters, no matter how small their role. It is a book that I\u2019m not likely to forget at any time. Jellicoe Road deals with death and loss, with abandonment, drug-addiction and suicide. Each character has her or his own terrible past to come to terms with, and sometimes I wondered: How do these people manage to live on when even I almost can\u2019t cope with what they\u2019ve been through?

I can understand that the beginning may seem a little confusing with its eerie, almost dream-like quality, but it\u2019s definitely worth reading on. ...more I first read 'On The Jellicoe Road' in 2006. I had been DYING for it's release ~ and can still remember how tingly and giddy I felt as I walked home with my copy. Back then, I had 3 kids under 5 and couldn't wait for them to get in bed so I could curl up and savour my new Melina Marchetta. On The Jellicoe Road is notorious for people finding the beginning confusing ~ and I have seen lovers of the book urge people to persevere to find it's magic. It was not like that for me. From the first chapter I first read 'On The Jellicoe Road' in 2006. I had been DYING for it's release ~ and can still remember how tingly and giddy I felt as I walked home with my copy. Back then, I had 3 kids under 5 and couldn't wait for them to get in bed so I could curl up and savour my new Melina Marchetta. On The Jellicoe Road is notorious for people finding the beginning confusing ~ and I have seen lovers of the book urge people to persevere to find it's magic. It was not like that for me. From the first chapter ~ I was spellbound. I remember thinking it was beautiful and haunting and funny and so entirely utterly appealing ~ the prose and the mystery and the characters. I guess I did feel a little like: what is going on? But not in a distracting way. It was absorbing and engaging and mesmerising. And entirely unexpected. I LOVED how gorgeously chaotic the story initially felt. I knew NOTHING about it ~ I even wondered if Santangelo would be the love interest in the early days (which quickly flew from my mind as Jonah's (JONAH!) story started unravelling). I LOVE that I knew nothing about it. Not one review, not one opinion. I had my expectations of awesomeness (it was, after all, a Melina Marchetta and I had read (and re-read) her previous two books countless times. Reading it blindly was a stunning experience: I felt like the whole world was just me and the book. That the entire experience was mine. That no one had gone before me. That the story was for me and I was a part of the story. I still feel like that, in a way. I see others discovering it and loving it and I am SO proud of it (as if, somehow, it is mine, haha) ~ but a small part of me feels like it belongs uniquely to me. More to me than anyone else (I know this is a ridiculous sentiment, but I still feel it). I almost feel private about it ~ as if it has become a part of me and talking about is like letting others peek into my soul. That very first time: I read it all in one go. I was shattered and absorbed and breathless and incredulous. I fell in love with the characters and the prose and the setting. I still recall finishing the book and how I felt gutted and euphoric and in awe all at once. Too stunned to cry (even though it would have been lovely to weep), I lay in my bed for an hour, just thinking about it. And then ... I picked it up and started reading it from the beginning all over again. Since then, I have read it every year (sometimes more than once). It has never lost it's magic. It weaves itself deeper into me. It is my own personal cult book <3 It seems ridiculous that I have not reviewed my favourite book of all time. I think I just feel entirely too inadequate to be up the the task. I also feel like it is such a part of me that I want to hold it close and not share it with the world. Yet another part of me feels like I could talk about it all day long and never tire of things to say and quotes to quote. This isn't a review, per se. It is me, humbly telling you, that 'On The Jellicoe Road' is my favourite book of all time. It is brilliant and hopeful and ache-y and truly soul-changing. It is the kind of chaotically gorgeous masterpiece that you only ever-so-rarely stumble across. It is perfect in it's brilliance. It radiates life and hope even as it is filled with grief and sorrow. It is everything, everything , I love about reading, in such a way that it almost ruined me for other books ;) I am completely undone for it. ...more \u2620 Territorial War buddy read/reread with Chelsea , Jennifer , Jen , Laura & Harriet \u2620 What happens when you reread this incredible book?

It possibly became my favorite. Ever. That kind of means something when we read a million book a year, right? \"I fall in love with these kids over and over again and my heart aches for their tragedies and marvels at their friendship\". \u2592 This book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592 Why is it so special to me? You mean, except from the fact it's written by Marchetta and contains Jonah Griggs in it? Apart from that? Well, what you need to know is that few authors manage to change my perception of myself as a reader. Yet if there's something I learnt this year, that's Melina Marchetta's books are written in a way that makes me want to create a stamp which would say - That says it all. The reason I rarely cry when I read is the fact I hate feeling manipulated . I loathe it when I can see through the author's intentions and I'm pretty sure that's why I never succeeded in finishing The fault in our stars . Melina Marchetta's books show me something I was eager to learn, because even if I knew it deep down inside, I was seeking out the moment I'd unravel all my doubts : No, I'm not a cold-hearted reader. I was just longing for stories which really speak to me, because, never, ever again I want to find myself thinking 'oh, I think I'm supposed to cry right now' . The beauty of her books lies in the surprise they never fail to create in me : I could express it with a single word : suddenly . And that emergence of unexpected feelings? I live for that shit . \u2592 But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592 Jellicoe road takes us into the life of characters so strongly convinced of the uselessness of their life that we want to fight for them. We want to tear the appearances out, and above all that, we're grateful to Melina Marchetta because her characters are so relatable and real that we can find pieces of ourselves in them . Pieces of our friends. Pieces of our family. Pieces of my heart that broke for Jonah Griggs over and over again . \"Please don\u2019t be crazy, Taylor,\u201d Griggs whispers, leaning his head against mine. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be crazy.\u201d He kisses me, holding my face between his hands, whispering over and over again, \u201cPlease\" . Therefore don't worry if you're confused throughout the 100 first pages, I swear to you, there must surely come a stage when you'll find yourself utterly captivated by Taylor's journey. Moreover, after reading it a second time, I can assure you that this experience was even more emotional and that Marchetta wrapped her plot brilliantly - I noticed some things I couldn't see the first time and WOW . Just WOW . This structure? Incredible. Everything has a sense. Everything has a purpose. Nothing's useless. Nothing . \u2592 But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592 This is a tale about where we belong . Is it a place? Is it a person? Is it love ? Can we stop belonging somewhere? Can we earn the right to belong or is it something we have in our heart no matter what we do ? Can we allow somebody else to be our everything ? Because what happens, I'm asking I'm yelling, what happens if our everything disappears? *whisper* Do we disappear as well? Now, I don't want to scare you how that's too late? and I can assure you that Jellicoe Road isn't the kind of book that makes your eyes ache all long without never releasing the tension. No. That's just life, you know? So prepare yourself for a ride - you're going to laugh, to be pissed, to be desperate at times, to lose hope and then fight to find it again - You're going to live and feel and smile. \"Go on, admit it. When he hits the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?\" \u2592 But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592 I don't want to talk about the plot. Damn, I just can't and I'll say only one thing : even if I guessed some parts of the mystery pretty fast, following Taylor and Jonah was an experience I'd have been sad to miss and that captivating and splendorous story will linger in my heart and in my thoughts for a very long time. You know what you have to do. \"I reach the bottom and smash into him with my fists as hard as I can. He falls and I can't believe he goes down that easy, caught off balance. \"You care about nothing, you piece of shit!\" I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him. \"Never,\" he tells me in a tone full of ice, \"under-estimate who or what I care for.\u201d PS : I have a million quotes to write, a million stories about Jonah, Webbs, Tate, Narny, Jude, Fitz, Taylor, Jessa to tell. But I won't. I won't because this is a book which must be savored blind. I won't even if Jonah Griggs is certainly one of the characters I will never forget.

The mystery behind the characters is also one great reason that kept me reading on, wanting to find out the connections among the characters. The story also relates the different ways by which people process grief through the different characters and by reading the story, it was as if I was grieving with each character. Good thing, like any other process, grief too has an end or at least a point in which the person must move on and the story thankfully ends with the inspiring message of moving on and living and appreciating life the way those whom you\u2019ve lost would want you to. ...more Review also on I thought about Kintsukoroi long after I read On The Jellicoe Road.

You know Kintsukoroi, the Japanese art of repairing pottery with gold or silver lacquer. Making the piece more beautiful for having been broken. I am not usually given in to melodramatics but this beautiful book evoked a riot of feelings in my ice-box of a heart. On The Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham overlapping with that of another mysterious narrator whose point of view is in italic.Taylor Markham is a leader of one of the houses at the Jellicoe School, her history is riddled with more questions than answers. Unanchored to anyone, or to anything, she feels lost, an outsider to her own story looking in. \u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201d She craves history, and Hannah, her only link to the past, had disappeared without a word. In her quest to find Hannah, with a jumbled and unfinished manuscript as her only clue, Taylor inadvertently comes to grips with the pain of her mother's abandonment and fleeting memories of being loved. While Taylor is finally confronting her past, she is also leading the Jellicoe School in territory wars against the Townie and the Cadets. The Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, a boy whom Taylor spent a few eventful days with years ago. I am not fond of young adult books dealing with difficult topics because the teenage angst and drama irk me off, but On The Jellicoe Road is the exception. Of course, with the topics explored in this book, some angst and drama are inevitable, but Melina Marchetta is never heavy handed with them. She writes emotions on levels we, or at least I, understand. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\" he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.\u201d She can pack one hell of a left hook right in the solar plexus with a single word, a testament of her compelling, lyrical writing. Damn you, Marchetta. The characters are terrific, they are raw, layered and relatable. I wanted to hang-out with Taylor, Jonah, Raffy and Santangelo in the tree-house. I still do, honestly. Taylor is especially complicated. Who wouldn't be, given her situation. The most remarkable thing about Taylor and her narrative is the air of pragmatic self-destructiveness. Like she is always on the verge of spiraling down. \u201cI do keep him at the back of my mind for those times I get me hopes raised about something. So then I can slap myself into reality and remind myself of what happens when you let someone into your sacred space.\u201d ...but yeah, read the book if she truly does. The plot ties up neatly in the end and I am more than satisfied with the ending, but it takes some patience to get to the ending. You see, like Kintsukoroi, On The Jellicoe Road starts with broken pieces or fragments of a life, of a story, that may not make sense at first but as the the novel progresses, the pieces will fit and by the end you'll have yourself a beautiful whole story. So do yourself a favor and just let yourself be lost in this gem of a book,don't even back-track. I promise, it pays off in the end. On The Jellicoe Road is a story of friendship, love, forgiveness and grief. It's so much more, but I'll end it at that. I did not cry but that's more on my damaged tear ducts than the book,but okay fine, I admit, it also kind of, well, broke me. Yet somehow I am filled with hope for the characters in the book and for the young adult genre. Melina Marchetta folks, as long as she writes, there'll be good young adult books to read. ...more First of all: many thanks to my friends over at The Corner, for making me want to read this book. \u2665 I'm really glad I struggled through the first few chapters, even while feeling like an idiot because it was like standing in the middle of a group of people who were speaking a language I couldn't understand.

Hand me a contemporary written by Marchetta, and I'll turn into a tsunami of tears. This review is not going to be as extensive as my usual ones, but please be so kind to check out my co-blogger Chantal's lovely review on our blog Every Word A Doorway . I've avoided On the Jellicoe Road for years tbh. Probably because I had loved Saving Francesca so much in my youth and was scared that no other Marchetta book would ever compare. Finnikin of the Rock certainly couldn't, and I strongly believe Marchetta was born to be a realistic fiction writer, not a creator of fantasy worlds. So then I was at my local book store last winter and Chantal all but forced me to buy this. My history of avoiding this book continued, however, as it sat lonely and misplaced on my shelf. Last week, I finally decided to pick it up. Which brings us to the sobfest that is my broken self after reading this book. Saving Francesca is still closer to my heart, mainly due to its topics, but On the Jellicoe Road felt quite similar in style with its troubled main character, witty side protagonists, brooding love interest, school setting, and the serious issues it tackles. I adored the characters, especially the main character, as much as I enjoyed the dark humour from the first person POV from which the story was told. Compared to Saving Francesca , this book has a touch of mystery , as snippets of a manuscript appear between chapters, slowly unravelling along with the main character's personal storyline. Marchetta also never sugarcoats a first and/or young love which I value in a genre full of unicorns and rainbows. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because the beginning is too abrupt a start. The first chapter was both confusing and unnerving, making me wonder whether I wanted to continue, and it took me quite some time go become invested in the story thereafter. A smoother introduction would've been required. Besides shattering my heart and then glueing the pieces together again, On the Jellicoe Road brought on a massive flood of nostalgic childhood memories from Australia. Have your characters call a stroll in nature a 'bushwalk', their nightgowns a 'nightie' and each other 'mate', and I'll be a little curled up ball of homesickness. Can I just spread the love for these little shits who warmed my heart? \"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Griggs.\" Anson Choi feigns surprise. \"What's her name?\" \"I didn't actually catch her name,\" Griggs continues. \"Lily,\" Raffaela says over her shoulder and this time I give her a sideways look. \"Great to know that I'm in love with a girl with a cool name.\" \"It's Taylor's middle name,\" Raffaela calls back again. Placing Raffaela in the path of an oncoming car becomes one of the major priorities of the next ten seconds of my life. With their hysterical fits and unexpected violent outbursts coming from gentle characters? \"Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?\" On the Jellicoe Road is a beautiful book that will move you, grip you, and enchant you with fleshed out characters, an air of mystery, and a touching story. For those of you who enjoyed this book but haven't picked up any other books by Melina Marchetta, I highly recommend Saving Francesca . ...more So you know when you\u2019re watching TV, and land on some movie but have no idea what it\u2019s about?

Yea, that was this book for me. I started it, was lost for like the first 30%, but then when 50% came around, I COULDN\u2019T. FREAKING. STOP. The beginning was a little confusing because the author just kind of throws you into the story with zero background or knowledge of what\u2019s going on. But as the story goes on, little hints and clues and these crazy coincidences start to appear and the whole time you\u2019re like holy shit didn\u2019t this happen before? Wait, is she that girl? OMG IT IS! What does this mean??!? I\u2019m going to try to explain what this story is all about without spoiling anything so if you do happen to pick this up (AND YOU TOTALLY SHOULD) you\u2019ll have a little background. The heroine Taylor \u2013 who I would like to point out was such a great complex character - was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road when she was 11. She doesn\u2019t know why but is brought to the Jellicoe School. And at this school, the kids are spread among \u2018houses\u2019 (think of a type of sorority/fraternity). Taylor is elected to be the leader of her house and to lead the school\u2019s annual territory wars versus the Townies (the kids who go to I guess what would be equivalent to public school) and the Cadets (kids from a type of military school). And among the wars and fights and negotiations for things like access to biking trails and club houses, etc., Taylor is trying to figure out why her house mother has gone missing, why she dreams of the same boy every night and if he is trying to tell her something, why her mother abandoned her all those years ago, and how it\u2019s all connected. Insert Jonah Griggs. The leader of the Cadets, and the boy who stole the show and my heart. He is without a FREAKING DOUBT what made this story for me. He and Taylor have a history (even though they are supposed to hate each other while the \u2018wars\u2019 are going on.) His backstory was absolutely heartbreaking. The romance in this was very subtle but his moments with Taylor were so powerful and romantic and beautiful and had me wanting to cry like a child. All he wants is to help her heal and figure out the mystery of her past. \"I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.\u201d __ \u201cWhat are you thinking? \u201cI whisper after a while. \u201cThat you deserve romance,\u201d he says. And this whole book is so much more than the mystery. It\u2019s about love and family and friendship and acceptance and fate and okay I need to stop before I start crying because I really fell in love with this whole thing. I didn\u2019t expect to love this book so much, and just want to SHOUT about how much I did. I love picking up books not knowing where the hell it is all going and just being blown away in the end. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. http://amzn.to/1M7EULA Find Me On: Instagram \u2764 FB Page \u2764 FB Blog \u2764 Blog \u2764 Twitter ...more Tercera Lectura: 12 de marzo de 2015 Segunda Lectura: 3 de mayo de 2014 Este libro me ha dejado un desastre; desde que pase el 40% he sido un mar de lagrimas.
