Edward's journey is miraculous in that the little china rabbit from which the book gets its name learns to love out of his many losses, which starts with losing his straw hat and ends with losing his hardened heart. Take the velveteen rabbit, make him more fragile by making him the China rabbit, put in Kate DiCamillo's voice behind every word, and you have a new classic for children. \"I'm done with being loved,\" Edward told her.<---F> \"I'm done with loving</---F>. It's too painful.\" . . . \"Open your heart,\" she said gently. \"Someone will come. Someone will come for you. But first you must open your heart.\" The door closed. The sunlight disappeared. Someone will come. Edward's heart stirred. He thought, for the first time in a long time, of the house on Egypt Street and of Abilene winding his watch and then bending toward him and placing it on his left leg, saying, \"I will come home to you.\" No, no, he told himself. Don't believe it. Don't let yourself believe it. But it was too late. Someone will come for you. The China rabbit's heart had begun, again, to open. That's not the end of the story, but it is such an important passage for so many people to read. I needed to read it the other day when I sat there in Borders once again, tearing up. I'll need to read it again someday, maybe soon. And I think it's worth it for most anyone to take 30 minutes at the most, sit down, and read about how a China rabbit learns to love. And then learns to love again. ...more What a beautiful story. I read it with my 8 year old daughter and more than once it brought a tear to my eye. It is the story of Edward Tulane, the china rabbit, who while passing from owner to owner (<---B>companions really, as he comes to love them</---B>) endures great love and great tragedy. He learns that no matter what happens in life it is most important to open your heart....let yourself love and be loved. I was just trapped underground on a backed up metro train for an hour. Never have I minded, or noticed, a terrible commute less. Well-written, beautiful, and somber. This is the story of a china rabbit who learns the true meaning of love. I read this book out loud to my class and truly enjoyed the masterful way that Kate DiCamillo crafts a story. Her word choice and sentence fluency found its way into my writing lesson plans to illustrate some of the possibilities waiting to be found in words. Would I read it aloud again? Perhaps with older students. My class LOVED this story but it was sad, extremely sad in places. I fou Well-written, beautiful, and somber.

Perhaps with older students. My class LOVED this story but it was sad, extremely sad in places. I fought back tears while reading and had to let it sit for awhile before reviewing it because it dealt with some tough material. (Losing people you love.) Initially, I thought I would not recommend it nor read it again because it was just too strong. However, the more I considered this, the more I realized that to not recommend this book would be to make the same mistake that Edward made, and that is to refuse to experience something wonderful just because it can also be hard. So I do recommend it - I do! The lessons learned by Edward apply to us all. Just consider keeping a box of tissues close by. ...more You'd think I wouldn't cry after the third read, but all I can say is that I'm glad I skipped the eye makeup today... This story reminded me of \"The Velveteen Rabbit\". A little less magical, perhaps, but I appreciated the story of a rabbit who, instead of starting out full of love, learns to love and be loved until at the end of the story, he comes full circle. Easy reading, and could be a good one for reading out loud. While sitting in Washington Square Park reading my Moomins novel while on a mini-lunch break I wondered about the recurring use of sadness and melancholy in the book. Do American children books usually refer to the the joys of a sweet melancholy feeling at the lose of something good that will never return? How do children relate to depressed characters? Do they even notice it? Why aren't more children books filled with melancholy, and not in a humorous way? While the sun beat down on my bench, a While sitting in Washington Square Park reading my Moomins novel while on a mini-lunch break I wondered about the recurring use of sadness and melancholy in the book. Do American children books usually refer to the the joys of a sweet melancholy feeling at the lose of something good that will never return? How do children relate to depressed characters? Do they even notice it? Why aren't more children books filled with melancholy, and not in a humorous way? While the sun beat down on my bench, and the film crew near the fountain apparently were also on lunch from filming what looked like a 'dancing in the streets' movie, and the girl sitting the next bench over was losing in a battle of wits against a pigeon who was not going to be fooled into giving up the cracker she dropped I thought about these things. Then I came home and read this book. This book is to the Moomins as finding yourself laying in bed staring at the ceiling at 3am realizing that half your life is over all the good things are past and only pain and regret are ahead of you and having a slightly sad tinged memory of a something wonderful in the past that you will never be able to return to. There is something devastating about this story, and the whole format of the book, from the typesetting and font used to the color of the pages used in the book and the illustrations all work in a harmony to create this strong affect. I'm not sure how kids would react to this, I think from a child's perspective they would only see a story that kind of follows a kind of familiar pattern they are already familiar with. They might find it kind of sad, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Or maybe it will depress them and turn them at a young age to the happy joys of reading literature filled with despair. ...more When a friend told me she was reading this book with her 3 and 5 year old kids, I immediately questioned whether they found it too sad. I purchased this book soon after its initial publication and had read it myself at that time. My recollection was that it brought me to tears, and as I have two quite sensitive little boys, I was hesitant to introduce this one to them. Inspired by my friends successful reading of it with her two (slightly) younger children, I bravely undertook this venture - for When a friend told me she was reading this book with her 3 and 5 year old kids, I immediately questioned whether they found it too sad.

I was not able to hold back the tears as the story drew to a close, but my two beautiful boys wiped them away and assured me that there was nothing to be sad about, and I got the opportunity (one that seems to present itself quite often lately) to explain how tears can come from happiness as much as from sadness. A miraculous journey, indeed. ...more Nh\u1eefng h\u00f4m n\u00e0o m\u1ec7t m\u1ecfi, \u1ed1m, c\u0103ng th\u1eb3ng t\u00f4i s\u1ebd l\u00f4i trong t\u1ee7 s\u00e1ch c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh ra m\u1ed9t cu\u1ed1n s\u00e1ch d\u00e0nh cho thi\u1ebfu nhi \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111\u1ecdc.

Oh, but it was exquisitely and simultaneously joyful and sad. Maggie even asked me later last night, after we had finished the book and she was getting ready to brush her teeth, \"Why do people write about sad things, Mom?\" Ah - innocence slips away in small parcels.

Oh, but it was exquisitely and simultaneously joyful and sad. Maggie even asked me later last night, after we had finished the book and she was getting ready to brush her teeth, \"Why do people write about sad things, Mom?\" Ah - innocence slips away in small parcels. Then again, when I read her The Velveteen Rabbit, B actually came running into the room to find out what was the matter because she was so distraught. This equally touching story of a china rabbit is affecting. There is a wonderfully taught fairy tale in the midst of the story, and DiCamillo does not hesitate to leave sadness hanging in the air, strings untied, mean circumstances uncured, and yet somehow comes around to a happy ending. We all hope for the happy ending, but I am more encouraged by one that is imperfect because it is ultimately more believable. It is very readable, and the illustrations are quite nice. It moves quickly, and at Maggie's age it is exciting when you pass page 100 or 150 because it feels like a great novelty. However, if you do not have access to an interested and astute little one to read this to, there is charm to be found in it for everyone. I had to hold back tears when I was reading the last few chapters...and that almost never happens to me. So, either this will tug at your heart strings, or I am just turning into an old fuddy duddy. ...more My first DiCamillo read. I was blown away. I thought this was a simple story about love. I was wrong about it being simple, because it showed how complicated life and love really were. It was touching, it was classic, it was.. very heartbreaking. The first book to get me teary-eyed one of these days. I love it. I moved this review to my blog A miraculous journey, indeed. I just finished the audio version and my second time through this modern parable about learning to love. Below is my original review and it still stands. I can be quite a senimental sap at times and I have not cried this hard for joys mingled with regrets since The Last Battle by C.S. Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia .

I can be quite a senimental sap at times and I have not cried this hard for joys mingled with regrets since The Last Battle by C.S. Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia . I read this book aloud with my 7 yr old son. I think Kate DiCamillo is a special writer because she can write about china rabbits being loved by little girls and my son shifts quickly from soft pillow to sitting up rapt waiting for what comes next. I cannot wait to read another of her books. I was in rapt attention myself. This is the story of a china rabbit who is loved by a little girl named Abilene. Edward is well-dressed, has his own pocket watch, gets to sit at the table with the family and thinks quite a lot of himself. He was purchased for Abilene by her grandmother, Pellegrina. One night Pellegrina tells Abilene a story about a princess that is quite full of herself and who is not interested in loving others. The message is not lost on Edward, especially when the woman leans over his bed and says to him \"You disappoint me.\" Fate takes Edward in and out of the lives of many who love him and slowly but surely he begins to understand what Pellegrina was alluding to with her story so long ago. I cried again, when I told my husband all about it. This was a really great book. The illustrations were lovely as well and really captured the quiet, endearing, enduring feel of this book. The story is appropriate for someone as young as 5 or 6, but some of the vocabulary is a bit large.

Recently, I picked up a copy of this book along with The Magician's Elephant , yet another gem by the same author, to have at home for the kiddos. In between books, I decided to re-read <+++>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</+++> while doing my morning walk on the treadmill. And once again I am in awe of Kate DiCamillo. Her stories are timeless, beautifully written, magical and filled with memorable moments and memorable characters. I often think people underestimate how hard it is to write for children, because let's face it, a really good piece of children's literature not only has to win over its target audience but also has to appeal to adults. This is one I can see myself reading to my grandchildren some day along with many of her other works. Can't say that about many contemporary stories. ...more This is the harrowing tale of a china rabbit doll who is separated from his young owner and undergoes a series of harrowing adventures over a number of years before finding a happy resolution. Left to myself, I would put it alongside Black Beauty or Lassie Come Home, tales of animals who endure extended abuse, hardship and/or neglect before being reunited with owners who love them. When I read those stories in my distant youth, they spoke to me. Now, I fear, if I re-read them, I might suspect tha This is the harrowing tale of a china rabbit doll who is separated from his young owner and undergoes a series of harrowing adventures over a number of years before finding a happy resolution.

When I read those stories in my distant youth, they spoke to me. Now, I fear, if I re-read them, I might suspect that the author was deliberately playing with my emotions. Even though I know that authors, do exactly that to make a point. What charmed me about this book was having it read to me in 20 minute segments at night by one of my grand children. And seeing how the book spoke to her much-less-jaded heart, and how she rejoiced in the ending. And hearing the beauty of the 'story telling voice' in this book that does not shrink from a sophisticated vocabulary in choosing the right word over the simpler word. So, this book was a 3 star for me, and 5 star for the child who read it to me.

The previously obscure \u201cEdward Tulane\u201d has been propelled to the upper reaches of the Korean book chart for several weeks by a somewhat unlikely association. \u201cEdward Tulane\u201d plays a key role in the highly popular K-drama \u201cMy Love From the Stars\u201d which was voted Korea\u2019s favorite program earlier this year. The premise of \u201cMy Love From the Stars\u201d centers around an alien who landed in Korea during the Joseon period and who has been living here for the past 400 years. Cursed and blessed with a perfect physical appearance that never ages (embodied by heart throb actor Kim Soo-hyun), he has to change his identity every 10 years to avoid his alien nature being discovered. That is until the present day when he rather inconveniently falls in love with the country\u2019s most famous hallyu (Korean wave) actress. Throughout the story, the mysterious alien claims that \u201cEdward Tulane\u201d is a reflection of his own life as well as his key to understanding human emotion and experience. It is easy to see why this otherworldly visitor would be charmed by \u201cEdward Tulane.\u201d DiCamillo\u2019s appealing tale tells the life story of a haughty, vain and prideful china rabbit \u2013 the eponymous Edward. Edward\u2019s story begins in the 1930\u2019s when he is given as a birthday present to Abilene; an adoring ten year old girl who loves Edward unconditionally. The china rabbit\u2019s arrogant disposition however prevents him from appreciating this care and affection. Edward\u2019s life soon changes when he is lost on a family trip. From then on, he is acquired and lost by a variety of owners, some of whom treat him with kindness and some who are cruelly inconsiderate. As Edward travels with the fishermen and hoboes he encounters, he slowly loses his pride, coming to realize that \u201cif you have no intention of loving or being loved, then the whole journey is pointless.\u201d \u201cThe Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\u201d is tinged with a melancholic magic and its seemingly whimsical nature hides deep reserves of sadness. It\u2019s a story for children (and aliens) of all ages. ...more I am so happy that I will never be too old to read children's books! I am not too proud to say that I cried either.

I think I'll pick up a copy to save until my children are older, as the themes do seem to be a little too complex for their sensitivities. I would recommend, however, reading it rather than listening to the audio version. The narrator attempted to use different voices most of which ended up sounding like Brer Rabbit or the Wicked Witch. Edward Tulane is a china rabbit, commissioned specially for Abilene Tulane by her grandmother, and he\u2019s one vain bunny. He spends most of his time admiring himself and the fine figure he cuts in his custom-made silk suits. Abilene\u2019s grandmother seems to know Edward\u2019s thoughts are only for himself, for she warns him that without love, he will never be happy. And when Edward is tossed overboard by a couple of kids when he and Abilene are on a cruise he comes to know the truth of it. For the first Edward Tulane is a china rabbit, commissioned specially for Abilene Tulane by her grandmother, and he\u2019s one vain bunny. He spends most of his time admiring himself and the fine figure he cuts in his custom-made silk suits. Abilene\u2019s grandmother seems to know Edward\u2019s thoughts are only for himself, for she warns him that without love, he will never be happy. And when Edward is tossed overboard by a couple of kids when he and Abilene are on a cruise he comes to know the truth of it. For the first time in his life Edward is alone and his beautiful clothes are ruined. He finally starts paying attention to something other than himself. His life, then, changes dramatically and he meets (and loves) a number of other people. First there are a fisherman and his wife, who adore Edward, make him new clothes, talk to him. But their horrible daughter throws him in a trash heap. Then, a hobo and his dog find and adopt him and he becomes their traveling companion. When they are discovered in an empty boxcar, however, he is thrown into the woods. Later, he is discovered by a little boy, who takes him home to his sister \u2013 a very sick little girl. Eventually, she dies and Edward and the boy \u2013 miserable over her death - travel to the city to make their fortune. Edward nearly meets his end there, when an angry restaurant owner breaks him. But he is saved by a toy-maker, who carefully repairs him. He comes full circle when Abilene\u2019s own daughter comes into the shop and chooses him. This story felt manipulative. Edward is not very likable initially, but his traumatic experiences change him. And then it\u2019s just one horrible thing after another, with me sitting on the edge of my chair waiting for him to break. People were needlessly cruel to him, to one another. And it just left me irritated. Kate DiCamillo is also the author of Because of Winn-Dixie, which is such a wonderful book. This just doesn\u2019t touch it. It was disappointingly shallow, with Edward set up to learn a hard and harsh lesson through much adversity and abuse. Great. Beat up the bunny. Make people out to be either good or evil but never a bit of both. Good thing it\u2019s short. Bleh. ...more M\u1ecdi c\u00e2u chuy\u1ec7n bu\u1ed3n b\u00e3, t\u0103m t\u1ed1i, n\u1ebfu k\u1ebft th\u00fac h\u1ea1nh ph\u00fac \u0111\u1ec1u s\u1ebd s\u00e1ng b\u1eebng l\u00ean th\u1ebf n\u00e0y. \u0110\u1ebfn m\u1ee9c tr\u00e1i tim m\u00ecnh vui s\u01b0\u1edbng \u0111\u1eadp binh binh nh\u01b0 mu\u1ed1n nh\u1ea3y t\u00f3t kh\u1ecfi l\u1ed3ng ng\u1ef1c :P.

I loved everything about this perfect story of a lost toy but what I loved the most was the intricate way that the language of this story was handled.

The language was a little high for children but made the story so enjoyable for the reader. Aside from this beautiful love affair with the English language was this lovely, lovely story about the redeeming quality of love...accepting love, suffering love, and healing through love. I was literally incapable of reading the final page aloud and that was the second time in the book that I was choking back tears. Powerful, beautiful, masterful...a book to be treasured. ...more A beautiful and moving story of learning to open our hearts, even when they haven't been tested or after they are broken. I admit that several parts of the book had me in tears. The illustrations are beautiful and the message even more so. Highly recommended! Lovely illustrations throughout. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

Dia dilayan dengan baik sekali meskipun dia hanya sebuah patung mainan. Edward menganggap dirinya hebat dan kurang mempedulikan lain-lain hal termasuklah tuannya. Pada satu masa, ketika sambutan hari lahir Abilene kesebelas, ibu bapanya membawanya belayar menaiki kapal mewah dan bermulalah kisah hidup Edward yang begitu panjang dalam episod mengenali erti dan perasaan kasih sayang. Di atas kapal mewah itu, ada beberapa orang budak lelaki yang nakal mengusik Abilene. Tanpa kawalan, Edward tercampak ke dalam lautan biru yang luas dan dalam. Terdamparlah Edward beberapa lama di dalam lautan sehingga berlaku ribut. Akhirnya Edward tersangkut pada jaring nelayan laut dalam. Suasana baru, tuan yang baru dan diberi nama yang baru. Nellie dan Lawrence memanggilnya Susanna dan tinggallah Edward bersama mereka beberapa lama. Menemani Nellie yang rajin memasak, menjadi teman Lawrence keluar bersiar-siar di waktu malam dan mendengar celoteh mereka suami isteri. Namun, segalanya berubah apabila Lolly, anak Nellie pulang menziarahi ibu bapanya. Lolly membuang Edward di tempat buangan sampah. Hmm..saya tidak pasti mengapa Lolly bertindak demikian. Ya, Edward merasakan satu perasaan. Kasih sayang. Dia mahu kembali mendapatkan Nellie dan Lawrence! Hampir setahun di situ, akhirnya Edward mendapat tuan baru. Seorang gelandangan yang bertemankan seekor anjing. Tuan baru ini sangat menghargai Edward dan Edward juga dapat menyesuaikan diri berpindah dari satu tempat ke satu tempat yang lain. Siapa sangka, tujuh tahun lamanya Edward bersama mereka sehinggalah Edward dicampak keluar gerabak keretapi oleh seorang samseng. Huhu..penat sungguh menjadi seorang Edward -_- Siapa pula tuan baru Edward kali ini? Seorang perempuan tua mengutip Edward dan dibawa pulang. Rupa - rupanya dijadikan orang-orang bagi menakutkan burung yang datang ke kebunnya. Dalam diam, seorang budak lelaki datang \"menyelamatkannya\" lalu diberi kepada Sarah Ruth, adiknya yang menderita sakit. Namun, bahagia Edward tidak lama apabila Sarah Ruth meninggal dunia akibat penyakitnya. Budak lelaki itu membawanya jauh ke Memphis dan menyara hidup dengan mengadakan persembahan jalanan. Malang menimpa sekali lagi. Edward dihentak oleh pemilik restoran tempat budak lelaki itu makan kerana dia tidak mampu membayar makanan yang di makan. Berakhirkah hidup Edward? Budak lelaki yang baik budi itu membawanya ke sebuah kedai alat permainan dan tuan kedai sanggup memperbaiki keadaan Edward dengan dua syarat. Pertama, budak lelaki itu membayar upah membaiki Edward atau kedua menyerahkan Edward kepadanya. Pilihan kedua dipilih. Oh, sedihnya :( Edward dibaiki dan diberikan tempat terbaik di dalam kedai itu. Namun, selepas bertahun-tahun hidup susah dan selalu sahaja terpisah dari tuannya, Edward menjadi kembali pesimis. Dia tidak mahu menaruh harapan lagi. Baginya tiada guna menyayangi orang lain kerana dia sudah kecewa. Sehinggalah pada satu hari sebuah anak patung baby doll berusia 100 tahun ditempatkan di sebelahnya dan mereka berbual-bual. Baby doll itu menasihatinya supaya membuka pintu hati untuk menerima orang barulah dirinya akan disayangi. Sungguh malang sekali apabila hidup tidak disayangi. Oh, pandainya baby doll ini berkata-kata! ^_^ Hari demi hari, bulan demi bulan, satu keajaiban berlaku.. Seorang anak gadis kecil masuk ke kedai bersama ibunya ketika hujan turun lebat di luar. Tanpa disangka, anak kecil itu berminat dengan Edward! Tambah mengejutkan, ibunya ialah Abilene! Oh..... ...more Edward Tulane is a china rabbit who cuts a fine figure, and he definitely knows it. Elegant, pampered, and hopelessly vain, Edward lives a luxurious life adored by a little girl named Abilene. But then one day Edward becomes a lost toy, and begins a long and incredible journey in an attempt to be found. This is the last in the Kate DiCamillo boxed set we bought a while ago, and I can easily say it's my favorite book of hers that I've read to date.

This is the last in the Kate DiCamillo boxed set we bought a while ago, and I can easily say it's my favorite book of hers that I've read to date. Despereaux and Winn-Dixie are sweet and artistic, but this book is a masterpiece. Part parable, part allegory, this isn't the most original story ever, but I didn't care in the slightest that it was a little unrealistic and predictable and sounded like stories I'd heard told before. The journey was such a delight (though undeniably melancholy at times) that I tore through it and was sorry when it ended. Edward's vignette-like travels were each unique and illustrative, and I loved how he met so many different types of people who all treated him so differently, but each taught him something along the way. They didn't shy away from the sadness of life, but there was always a purpose, and it was treated very gently. I really felt like I was reading something much bigger and more profound than a children's story about a lost rabbit. The writing feels effortless but effective, and very honest, which is SO refreshing in modern children's literature. I can't possibly imagine that the author didn't intend to make this book have so much depth in its message, but if she didn't, I'm glad that she wrote it how she did whatever her intention. I could honestly go on and on about this book, but I feel like my words aren't really enough to give it the praise it deserves, so I'll just say that I really enjoyed it, and sometimes even just thinking about the Coda makes me start to cry. I can't wait to read this with my kids one day. (At the risk of sounding pithy, the best comparison I can think of for this experience is watching Toy Story 3 for the first time, and trying to understand how that movie/this book could make me feel SO much.) This book completely lives up to its title -- it is a miracle. I am not at all ashamed to admit that I cried. A few times. And sometimes I cry just thinking about it. Yes. It's brilliant. It's sometimes sad, but it's so sincere I could hardly stand it. THANK YOU, Kate DiCamillo, for writing genuine children's literature. This is a marvelous, melancholy masterpiece. ...more (5 Stars) I was wanting something emotional, but I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting it to come from this children\u2019s book by Kate DiCamillo. *sniff, sniff* I had started the first chapter of this book over a month ago, but just wasn\u2019t in the mood to read it then.

Yes, it is a children\u2019s book, but it truly touched me and had me tearing up a few times. It had some beautiful illustrations by Bagram Ibatoulline. Edward Tulane is a vain china rabbit who was dearly loved by a 10-year old girl named Abilene. Though Edward was loved, he didn\u2019t know how to love in return. Then one day, Edward\u2019s life was changed forever and he was lost at sea. Thus, begins, Edward\u2019s journey from being surrounded by love, to being alone, found and loved, and then abandoned again\u2026 passing through several different lives and meeting some wonderful people, and also some truly horrible ones. Through this journey, Edward learns to love \u2026 but he also experiences having his heart broken \u2026 and then, he must learn to open his heart again. Edward learns the meaning of despair \u2026 and of hope. One day, when I have children, I would like to share this story with them. These are some of my favourite quotes: \"Edward knew what it was like to say over and over again the names of those you had left behind. He knew what it was like to miss someone. And so he listened. And in his listening, his heart opened wide and then wider still.\" .... \u201cLook at me, he said to her. His arms and legs jerked. Look at me. You got your wish. I have learned how to love. And it's a terrible thing. I'm broken. My heart is broken. Help me.\u201d .... \"\"I'm done with being loved,\" Edward told her. \"I'm done with loving. It's too painful.\"\" .... \"\"Open your heart,\" she said gently. \"Someone will come. Someone will come for you. But first you must open your heart.\" The door closed. The sunlight disappeared. Someone will come. \" ...more", "Title": "The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane"},
