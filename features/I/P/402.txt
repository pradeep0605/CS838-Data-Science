Gone Girl is a very specific kind of psych suspense novel, and its frequent misapplication as a readalike is maddening to anyone with a passion for readers' advisory. like me. that rant aside, i definitely feel that this book has a huge readership; it's just not the same one as The Secret History . this is an easy sell to fans of Twilight , Fifty Shades of Grey , or the new adult genre. the writing is better than Twilight or Fifty Shades of Grey , and it has supernatural and mystery elements that Fifty Shades of Grey and new adult do not, but the romantic entanglements mirror the kinds found in those books, and are the driving force behind their success. the writing is very lush, and there is a feeling of the fairytale to this story, but it's a very modern and erotic version of a traditional fairytale, and the \"happily ever after\" is not guaranteed. thea is a first-year student at princeton, an accomplished pianist coming all the way from bulgaria to study at the same university her older sister elza attended fifteen years ago. elza was an enigmatic, ethereal, and dynamic young woman, who had a profound effect on all who knew her until she died under mysterious circumstances and her body disappeared from the morgue in even more mysterious circumstances. thea plans to solve these mysteries to give her parents closure, and to try to understand the legacy of the sister she never knew. but then she meets a boy. or two. after a mistaken-identity secret admirer fiasco, thea finds herself involved with two brothers, also pianists: jake and rhys. they are both older, immeasurably wealthy, and equally attractive/attracted to thea. rhys is the older and more dominant of the two, and he claims her immediately, while jake stands down and pines on the sidelines, occasionally given encouragingly romantic scenes with the confused thea. rhys immediately insinuates himself into all aspects of thea's life, arranging her time, wardrobe, and living arrangements - telling her who she can and cannot spend time with while retaining his own autonomy, declaring that he can never be a one-woman man. he is as mysterious as elza, with a haunted past and a tragic family story, which thea attempts to unravel, while all the while trying to discover what happened to her sister. so, despite the supernatural elements that will eventually reveal themselves, this seems to be a relationship completely in line with those found in the new adult genre - a damaged male lead with violent possessive tendencies and the only woman who can save him from his worst impulses. ditto this for the Fifty Shades of Grey comp, and add to it the financial angle, and the fact that thea is a virgin seduced by a man with an unusual and prolific sexual history. i think people who are fans of romance will definitely like this book. for me, it didn't appeal to me because this just doesn't speak to my own personal fantasies. wealth isn't a panty-dropper for me, especially when it's inherited money and not earned. i can understand and appreciate the way money makes life easier in certain aspects, and it opens doors to experiences and opportunities foreign to someone who has not come from that background, but unless the suitor has other qualities that are attractive, it's not enough to make me say \"yes, this appears to be a good match.\" and rhys is a nightmare character. i know that this is the new trend of male characters, from the limited experience i have with new adult, but i would have punched both jake and rhys in the face within moments of our meeting. do not approach me, stranger, in the dark deserted room of a museum and stand close enough that i can feel the heat from your chest on my chest. do not tell me that the elegant gown i have put on is \"too prim for (your) taste.\" and do NOT do this, when i am hesitant about consummating our relationship in a fairly public place, when i am a cautious virgin. \"Because\u2026 you don't even know me.\" \"I don't need to know you.\" His stunning eyes were ruthless. \"I need to have you.\" He pressed me back against the tree with an insistence that he was unable - or unwilling - to control. yeah, that doesn't work for me. that's how you get maced, frankly. i am not personally into this kind of fantasy that has so much violence simmering under the surface. i don't want to be \"had.\" i want to be \"known.\" but i get it, for other readers. it's a romance painted in broad strokes, and the fantasy of being swept off of one's feet by a man unaccustomed to hearing the word \"no\" is a common trope in the genre. plus, in this world which is porous enough to let in all different kinds of monsters, this isn't even the worst thing that can happen to someone, romantically speaking. the writing is at its best when it is focused on music. which is impressive enough, considering how difficult it is to pin down the transcendent effects of music in mere words. it is also fantastic when it discusses bulgarian vs. u.s. values, and in one of those passages, it managed to dismiss one of my criticisms as simply a product of my own cultural perspective: \u2026she loved worrying about me. Still, there were worse things than being \"stalked\" or \"claimed\" by a guy like Rhys. And what was this American obsession with stalking anyway? We had no such word in Bulgarian - people expressed their emotions in all kinds of ways, and to pursue a woman was expected of men; it didn't automatically mean crossing criminal lines. which i found illuminating. my ideas of courtship do not include statements like \"I'm guessing there are many things you think you don't want. But we'll have to change that.\" and i cannot relate to this sentiment: There was something intoxicating in his jealousy, even in his rage. It left him vulnerable and gave me a strange sense of power. \"Rhys, you are crushing me. I can't even breathe\u2026\" He pulled back just enough to let me catch my breath, but his grip around my wrists tightened. \"I said that I'm not going to share you. Which part didn't you understand?\" but maybe that's just my americanness poking through. thea's no prize either as far as heroines go. there's a selfishness to her, a cruelty, as she keeps rhys and jake on strings, vacillating between them indecisively, while keeping a third man on the side for those times when the estlin brothers are both off sulking somewhere. she's presented as an ing\u00e9nue, so it's meant to be forgivable instead of heartless, but no one is that na\u00efve. she consistently brings jake up to a certain point and then scurries away, and he just retreats and waits and yearns for her with unwavering devotion even though they barely know each other. there's a lot more patience and forgiveness in this book than is realistic. but again - this is a romance, this is a fantasy. and just because i don't like being pushed and pulled and pressed up against walls and told where to go and whom i cannot see, and just because i have no applause for a thirty-year-old man treating a teenaged girl like a kept woman with expensive gifts whose response to her telling him she will be going home to bulgaria for christmas to see her parents is \"They don't own you\" and \"It's your life. Nobody should tell you how to live it\" even though that is what she WANTS to do and pot/kettle and all that, doesn't mean this isn't an enjoyable romance novel for people who actually enjoy romance novels and aren't stupid finger-wagging killjoys like me who have to examine and dissect the fantasy like people don't understand that what's acceptable in fantasy isn't always acceptable in real life. so, yeah - while i find the romantic elements of this book irritating, that's just me and my pretty standard reaction to the kind of dangerous relationships idealized in popular romance novels these days. because i am an old curmudgeon with personal space/freedom issues. but i did like the music, the mythology, the parts where people weren't saying things like \"You make me come just with your breath, Thea\u2026I can come just from feeling your breath on my mouth.\" so, while i think the suggested readalikes are iffy (i still don't understand the Jane Eyre comp at all (view spoiler) [unless we are meant to see elza as bertha in the \"complicated romantic entanglements\" aspect. (hide spoiler) ] but otherwise, thea is the exact opposite of jane, who is way into romantic self-denial and not taking shit from rich guys) this book is definitely going to please folks who like bad boys and literary paranormal romances with a new and interesting spin on the typical supernatural elements. ...more I'm walking away from this one. I'm not rating it either. Why? First the good: The writing in this book is really good. There is a blend with Greek mythology and Bulgarian folklore involving the samodivi or wildalone that were some of the best I've read. Fascinating. I actually hate that I'm not going to stick around to see where that part plays out.

I actually hate that I'm not going to stick around to see where that part plays out. In the legends of my country, no creature is more beautiful or more cruel than the samodiva; the young witch of the forest who dances under a full moon, lures men with promises of love, then takes their lives. Folk superstitions claim the samodiva powers run in certain families, but I never believed this. Or at least tried not to. Now the bad: The main character to me is reminiscent of Bella Swann. I didn't worry that he would keep stalking me. I worried he wouldn't. \"No, you don't. We weren't here yesterday and you still acted this way. Why?\" \"Because...you don't even know me.\" \"I don't need to know you.\" His stunning eyes were ruthless. \"I need to have you.\" You need a restraining order against his ass is what he needs. As my RCA, she loved worrying about me. Still, there were worse things than being \"stalked\" or \"claimed\" by a guy like Rhys. And what was the American obsession with stalking anyway? We had no such word in Bulgarian-people expressed their emotions in all kinds of ways, and to pursue a woman was expected of men; it didn't automatically mean crossing criminal lines. I don't know if this is true. I'm skeered. There was something intoxicating in his jealousy, even in his rage. It left him vulnerable and gave me a strange sense of power. \"Rhys, you are crushing me. I can't even breathe..\" He pulled back just enough to let me catch my breath, but his grip around my wrists tightened. \"I said that I'm not going to share you. Which part didn't you understand?\" \"I thought we agreed on the sharing when you told me you were not a one-woman guy.\" The love triangle in this book is also between brothers. I just can't. I'm stepping away so that I don't completely hate the book for these reasons. I will read something else by this author though, because the good parts were good. ...more The premise of this book sounded SO good and totally in my wheelhouse, but ultimately there was nothing I enjoyed about it whatsoever. In fact, I resented the time I spent reading it, as I found nothing to redeem it. The writing was awkward and made it clear that Zourkova is not a native English speaker, the main heroine is spineless and a drip, and the two romantic interests are not compelling or alluring and mostly boss Thea around.

The writing was awkward and made it clear that Zourkova is not a native English speaker, the main heroine is spineless and a drip, and the two romantic interests are not compelling or alluring and mostly boss Thea around. The central mystery regarding her family's past is largely a snore, and the big reveals are so unsurprising and obvious. Given the strong, feminist legend the novel revolves around, it was so disappointing to have most of the \"tension\" of the novel revolve around which of two overbearing alpha male brothers Thea would fuck. I can only assume Zourkova is a fan of the Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey nonsense, and if you're a fan of those books too, then I guess you will like this. My feelings about all of this, however, can pretty much be summarized by the following BtVS exchange: Cordelia: \"I'd say we've hit bottom.\" Xander: \"I have a plan.\" Cordelia: \"Oh, no, here's a lower place.\" On behalf of Jane Eyre, which egregiously gets name dropped in the blurb about this book, I am offended. Best of all (by which I mean \"worst): <+++>Wildalone</+++> can't even contain its terribleness to a single volume. Like its ignoble predecessors, it too is the beginning of a series, the rest of which I most certainly won't be reading. ...more This book is amazing guys, it really is.

Her way of writing is so rich, so pure and so open, I fell in love with it instantly. Zourkova has a wonderful story in her hands and she knows it. She made magic with it and she lures you right into it. The author creates a perfect balance with this book; it has just the right amount of everything, nothing more and nothing less. Sure it has a love triangle but it\u2019s not a soppy one. Jake and Rhys complement one another. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love them as much as I do. You\u2019ll love one brother more than the other (trust me, I do.) but you will still need them both. Thea is wise beyond her age, she doesn\u2019t let anyone stop her and even though she isn\u2019t American, she fits right in. And this 3 make a perfect team. Even though it seems disturbing this love triangle has its own way of working. Not many authors know how to work a love triangle, but Zourkova surely did. ...more \u2606 I was gifted a copy of this title by the author in exchange for an honest review.

As well, an alternate reality of what\u2019s real versus myth\u2026the delicate balance of life and death...love and sacrifice... And ultimately taking control of your own destiny. Author <---A>Krassi Zourkova</---A> is honestly one of those authors I actually would say to be on the lookout for! Her writing is crafty, deep, and weaves outside of the borders or \u201cnorm\u201d that people would find acceptable or try to mold themselves into. As one of those readers who are fascinated with the supernatural and ancient mythology and folklore, I think many of you who fall into this category will be entranced and bewildered with how everything plays out. It is slowly, but intricately unfolded, with nothing rushed and no sort of annoying ploys or characters that will irk and get on your nerves. Krassi does a fantastic job in teaching readers like me about Bulgarian tales of the samodivi; while also interweaving it with infamous well-known Greek figures such as-- the god Dionysys, his female followers the maenad, the daemon, the Satyr, and even the tragic fate of the legendary musician, Orpheus. It was like a rush of old and new for me as I was more familiar with Greek mythology but not Bulgarian whatsoever. It was definitely a learning process of \u201cgoogling\u201d \u2018Bulgarian myths\u2019 and looking up what a \u2018samodivi\u2019 was and what they could do! Haha. Literally had me pausing and double reading a lot of the story content and researching them on the net! Lol I genuinely ate this novel up as it puzzled me, riddled me, and kept me thinking and guessing! Normally, I hate anything to do with love triangles but this one just aroused me and kept me on my toes. I mean, what is Thea going to do? Who is she going to choose, if she does? How is she possibly going to win back Rhys\u2019 heart and favor after that betrayal? And if there is any \"them\" left to salvage? Wah...I'm really busting at the seams on this one, as Rhys has literally hit his point of no return and no longer trusts anyone nor holds onto any fathoms of hope in regards to his set future. I wonder the what cards will hold for him in the end? And if he can be saved from his dreadful doom? Gosh, Krassi! I need bk 2 like now!!

So, it gets the somewhat meaningless, stuck-in-limbo rating of 3 stars. I'm saying this to myself for the thousandth time: I NEED TO STOP LISTENING TO COMPARISONS BOOKS MAKE TO OTHER BOOKS IN THEIR BLURBS. This particular one made the bold claim of \"a bewitching blend of Twilight, The Secret History, Jane Eyre, and A Discovery of Witches\". Now, I haven't read Jane Eyre but have heard it's one of the most readable classics, and I love love loved The Secret History, and found both Twilight and A Discovery of Witches to be enjoyable but ultimately silly. But the combination of all of these sounded intriguing, and who doesn't want something silly and mind-numbing every once in a while? However, to even mention this as being in a similar league to Donna Tartt is a great injustice to her - Wildalone is 100% on the Twilight end of the scale, with supernatural creatures and angsty love triangles to boot. Let's back up and do a brief summary: Thea Slavin is a Bulgarian native who comes to America to attend Princeton (I've since read that the author actually travelled this exact same path herself, which explains why the lovely descriptions of the Princeton campus are so compelling and atmospheric). She's stunning as well as a piano prodigy (so much so that she gets invited to play at Carnegie Hall...), and so naturally soon attracts the attention of the two most attractive and mysterious males within range of campus (Rhys and Jake), who also happen to be brothers. Thea has lived most of her life without knowing about her deceased sister, Elza, whom her grief-stricken parents kept a secret due to the circumstances of her passing, and when she discovers her sister's identity and the fact that she also attended Princeton, she is drawn to the campus while also hoping to solve the mystery of Elza's life there. There's also a whole lot of Greek and Bulgarian mythology thrown in there, with many parallels to Thea's own life, which I'm not going to go into detail on both because the myths are fairly intricate, and because it would get a little spoilery. The good stuff includes the writing, which is very pretty, particularly when Thea is contemplating her music or listening to one of the boys play (oh yes, they're also both basically piano prodigies), and the setting, which as I already mentioned is well drawn. The exception to this would be the dialogue, which felt somewhat formal and unrealistic, but maybe that's to be expected for Thea, who doesn't have a full grasp of English yet? The whole novel is also just somehow addictive - fast-moving, with a good mix of romance and plot, a few twists thrown in - even as I was frustrated or rolling my eyes, I kept turning the pages and needing to know how it all turned out. But the biggest problem is with the romance itself - the dreaded love triangle. The even MORE dreaded girl in love with two brothers love triangle. Rhys, the more aggressive older brother, is just an awful, awful character - he's possessive and borderline abusive, including such typical alpha male traits as refusing to allow Thea to spend any time with platonic male friends, pushing her to go farther physically than she's ready for, and forcing her to skip school, piano practice, and whatever else she has planned in order to hang out with him with no advance warning - but his money and charm and sex appeal are just supposed to make up for this. Jake is a little better, but is still far from perfect. And Thea makes all of this so much worse! She swings back and forth between the two of them whenever she feels like it, which is just unfair to both of them (she's cheating on one and leading on the other for pretty much the entire book) no matter how unpleasant I found them. She lets Rhys force her to abandon everything she previously found important...I mean, she's supposed to be playing at Carnegie Hall, for Pete's sake! Honestly, I could on and on, but I'm not usually too much of a ranter and I think it's time to stop. And my ranting comes with a little caveat: I'm not saying I didn't find some of the love scenes sexy, because I'll admit that I did (shame, shame). The long and short of it is that you may enjoy this book if you're a fan of mythology with large helpings of romance, or if you especially enjoy a very prominent love triangle, or if you like stories set on moody college campuses (I'm two for three here). I'm pretty sure this is going to be a series, and I will probably read the next book, and I will probably still hate-love it. Ah, well. ...more It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve read a modern Gothic (in a contemporary setting) as enthralling as Wildalone. Reminiscent of novels such as The Secret History and Lake of Dead Languages, Wildalone is a flawless blend of myth, fated love, and Gothic suspense.

Reminiscent of novels such as The Secret History and Lake of Dead Languages, Wildalone is a flawless blend of myth, fated love, and Gothic suspense. Among the many things that I loved about this novel was the way in which Zourkova interweaves Greek and Bulgarian myth, finding the commonalities between the two and creating her own, unique brand of myth. It was wild and harsh and carried the story through its entirety. One of my favorite chapters in the book involved Thea\u2019s memory of visiting her estranged family in far-away town in Bulgaria; it had beautiful, subtle elements of suspense. I also loved the way in which the mysterious, vanished sister ultimately factors into the conflict. Elsa\u2019s story is relayed to the reader in a gentle unfolding that leaves you just enough time to wish that it weren\u2019t so, but to be horrifically fascinated when you realize that it is (I\u2019m being vague here as to avoid too many spoilers). The other truly defining element of this story (for me) was Rhys. He is a resplendent, emotional-roller coaster of a character. Part \u201cAlpha Male\u201d, part tortured soul; his story (like Elsa\u2019s) was executed brilliantly, showing just enough of what we needed to know at just the right moments. I loved the fact that I was enraged with him one moment and saying \u201c\u2026\u2026.Ooooh\u201d the next. I also enjoyed the exploration into the triangular relationship between Rhys, Jake, and Thea. Upon reading the book\u2019s blurb, I falsely assumed that it would be a consensual relationship and was surprised when it wasn\u2019t. I struggled with the validity of Thea\u2019s feelings towards Jake; in fact, I could make a really good argument for why Thea\u2019s feelings for Jake are ri-donk-ulous. However, I enjoyed being so caught up in my feelings over a character, or group of characters. And the side-lining conflict of Rhys/Thea/ and (insert spoiler here): aching, devastating, and so well rendered. If there was anything dissatisfying about Wildalone, it was my desire for more when it ended. I appreciated the ambiguity of the end, though I would L-O-V-E a sequel or even a prequel; I think a prequel which focused on-ahem-\u201cother\u201d characters would be super! Regardless, this was a spectacular first effort by Zourkova and I impatiently await her next novel. ...more I have some good news and bad news for readers of Wildalone by Krassi Zourkova.

As an author and avid reader myself I wasn't expecting the contents of this story. What truly blows me away is that this is Zourkova's debut novel. It's beautifully written and the plot is well executed. She is a written illustrator of unparalleled talent. Seriously. You don't just see red poppies. You smell them. You can feel the warmth of the petals between your fingers after you pluck one from the sunny fields. It's incredible. On to the plot. How many times have you read a book with the tired dynamic of \"girl loves one boy and his brother too?\" I can think of five titles with that general plot without trying. However, throw in the mystical Bulgarian folklore waifs called \"samodivi\" and the dynamic changes. Just like that. Add in a god from Greek mythology and the dynamic turns again. For good measure, lets throw in an older sister of our main character who died on an elite college campus fifteen years prior but was never talked about. Interested yet? You should be. In a tragic tale of death/disappearance, carnal longing for one brother you cannot have, and a sense of obligation to the brother who reached you first. You cannot tell which direction Thea, our Bulgarian piano prodigy, will choose to lean until the very last page. Knowing her older sister, Elza, was found dead on campus, Thea already feels that there are facts she must know. Thrown headfirst into a professional concert atmosphere she sees a shadow drop a rose and nothing more. A short time later she gets her first assignment and meets the mystery shadow in another dark corner. No name. Not even a good look at him. He promises to find her. Instead his equally attractive brother Rhys finds in a morning fog. By the time she realizes her mistake it's too late to change it. Now Thea is torn between tragic Rhys and his self sacrificing younger brother, Jake. Both men have good qualities but she feels pulled toward both and cannot decide. Then, the shoe drops. To go into more detail would be to spoil your reading pleasure so I'll stop there. Suffice it to say that have never read a book with this story line. Zourkova gives fabulous descriptions of her native Bulgaria without spending long periods of time there. She introduces and explains her countries folklore and the stunning differences to our own. She then seamlessly weaves them into a tale in America in a way that makes the reader why they hadn't looked at these things before. It's truly engrossing. This is an absolute five star read and I highly recommend it to readers of all genres. There is something in here for everyone. I won this book through a Goodreads Giveaway. ...more Library Journal starred review: Zourkova, Krassi. Wildalone. Morrow. Jan. 2015. 384p. ISBN 9780062328021. $25.99; ebk. ISBN 9780062328045.

F Zourkova infuses her first novel with atmosphere, lyrical language, Greek mythology, Bulgarian folklore, and the sharp stab of first love. Thea is a piano prodigy from Bulgaria beginning her freshman year at Princeton University. After a public concert performance, she draws the attention of several men on campus, A first-person point of view and a sense of the surreal places the reader firmly in Thea\u2019s head as she tries to navigate an unfamiliar culture steeped in tradition: from dressing the part of a Princeton coed to the school\u2019s exclusive eating clubs. She is also thrown by the unexpected intricacies and intimacies of American relationships; her feelings for two mysterious men are complicated by family secrets on all sides. Fantastical creatures, forest witches known as Samodivi, or Wildalones, weave a thread through the entire novel, leading Thea to a decision that has consequences far beyond anything she could have imagined. VERDICT: Zourkova pulls off a balancing act that few debut authors manage: a clever, dark romance steeped in mystery, with a bittersweet thread of melancholy and keen sense of place. Fantasy and romance lovers, as well as those who liked Donna Tartt\u2019s The Secret History or Pamela Dean\u2019s Tam Lin should enjoy this.

On one hand, you will inevitably get really terrible books and you have to write about them, being fully honest on what you didn't like, but word it carefully so that a person wouldn't automatically dismiss it, maybe try it for themselves and form their own opinion. On the other hand, sometimes you get books that are so incredibly great that you aren't sure you can even make a convincing argument why a person should read this book other than, \"it's so great and it'll move you\". Because ultimately, as a book reviewer, you hope that what you write convinces someone to go purchase the book, get it from the library, do something with it beyond adding it the to \"to-read\" list we all have and likely will never finish in our lifetime. Because some books? Some books are worth bumping to the top. This is absolutely one of them. I feel so unequipped to give this a worthy review, but I'm going to really try. After reading the book it really is a mix of Twilight (Jake and Rhys both vying for Thea is very much like Edward and Jacob), it's so very much like Discovery of Witches (lots of Greek mythology, art history, magic, witchery, etc), but I also felt it was a little like Angelology (with Thea uncovering a mystery in her past and the ending... the ending is so much like the ending of Angelology that I had a little gasp). This book is the absolute perfect blend of thriller, mystery, paranormal, romance, magic and even a little chick lit because you can't help but be endeared by Thea, a Bulgarian trying to make it in America and understand culture here. But what sets this book apart is that no matter how you feel about Greek mythology, whether you have no idea about much of it and could care less (me), or you are an avid fan, you find yourself interested and learning. Your heart hurts for Thea who lost her sister (literally) at Princeton 15 years earlier under mysterious circumstances. She died and her body was found... but then disappeared from the funeral home and nobody has any clue why or where it went. And that's not good enough for Thea, who can't help but feel like there was far more to her sister's mystery than what meets the eye. It doesn't help that seemingly everyone who knew her sister Elza speaks to Thea in riddles and she's having to figure it all out on her own. It feels like her death is somehow connected to strange rituals thought long forgotten but that surely doesn't make sense, does it? Enter Rhys. Mysterious, definitely brooding, enigmatic, alluring, everything you want in a bad boy. Something is very off with him though Thea can't place it and she's not even sure she wants to because what she does know is that she can't be without him. Thoughts of him consume her and though her friends think he's a bit much, a little over bearing and definitely possessive, she doesn't care. Then she meets Jake, his almost identical looking brother who she finds out is who she thought Rhys was (sounds weird, but I can't explain it further otherwise it ruins a good part of the book for you) and here we begin the battle between brothers. One is the safe choice, one is definitely not but she doesn't know why. She doesn't know the strings that comes with the one brother, until the end, and when she makes a decision- it's almost too late. Because with every great book comes an ending. And the ending isn't always what it should be. What you want it to be. Angelology is one of my favorite books because I felt all of the torment and the struggle the main character had once she learned what she really was. And she had to make a choice at the end and I don't think she made the right one. Not at all. But in Wildalone, as we're getting to the end, and I feel my heartbreak coming on because one of the brothers loves Thea so much that he is willing to die for her, Thea makes a desperate visit to the Underworld and... we learn so much while she's there. She does as well. We learn how flawed her sister was, how nothing was really as it seemed and.. we cut to her seemingly on her way to a decision. But that's it. So it's almost like... a build your own ending but not really. I don't always say this and I might regret it as I did with Angelology because the sequel to that books was TERRIBLE and made me hate everything I loved about the first one, but I kind of hope Wildalone has a sequel. Just to indulge me, not because one is needed. This is the type of book I don't want to part with the characters, I feel like I know too much of the story and I still want more. Does that make sense? But I'll leave you with this- it is my absolute hope that the unsaid ending is not like Orpheus essentially giving up and letting the maenads kill him because he lost the love of his life, Eurydice. (Which is the Greek myth heavily referenced in this book, so stay with me, I'm not talking crazy.) I hope the brother, the one so madly in love with Thea, doesn't end this way because I don't know if I could bear it. I just couldn't. Because what Thea feels for the safe brother isn't the kind of thing that lasts a lifetime, or even beyond. It's not. It's safe and secure. But the other brother... that's happiness beyond what she could hope for. Even with the strings attached. And with that, I leave you. Please add this to your to-read list, go and buy the book (Amazon or Barnes & Noble) and then let me know what you think. I said it last night on Facebook that though this is only January, this is a contender for book of the year for me. I cannot get enough of the writing, the characters, the cover (God this cover is gorgeous and now I want a bouquet of poppies. I need a guy to give me a vase of poppies, and my husband said poppies are stupid.), just the amount of research that goes into putting such a great novel together blows my mind and truly. It's so great. I can't say how great this is enough. ...more THIS BOOK IS MAGNIFICENT. Just from the description of the book prior to its release had me hooked.

The intricate details that Zourkova provides is what really captivated me. I am no stranger to the stories of Greek mythology but her sophisticated and elaborate details of the myths as well as the elements of music had me feeling like I was Thea herself, splitting my time between learning the captivating stories in art history and fitting in time to exercise my piano prodigy status. The details were so in-depth that I felt that I had spent an entire semester alongside Thea at Princeton, when in reality I chewed up this glorious 374 page novel in a mere 3 hours. Oh and the romance! Mysterious, a bit wicked, and downright flawless. There were many a time that I caught myself having the put the book down and prepare myself for what was ahead as well as fantasize/guess the next scene. Right when you think you have things figured out Zourkova pulls the rug out from under you and next thing you know you are headed in an entirely different and glorious direction. This is also one of the lovely elements of this novel, it is not predictable in the least! In all, this is definitely one of the best books I have ever read and has earned a special place on my bookshelf. I feel like the next few novels I read are just filler reads until I get my hands on Zourkova's next novel! ...more Much deeper book than I expected.

The basic story itself is not what interested me, by I was fascinated by how the author entwined the Orphic mysteries into the legends about Samodivi. Orpheus came from Thrace, and since these people did not have a written language, what is known about him comes from the Greeks. This book gives a new perspective. Perhaps one that the Thracians themselves might have written. There were even subtle things that the average reader would not understand who was not familiar with the ways of the Samodivi--how they arrive on a torrential force, a whirlwind. On a cultural note, it brought back memories of my own time spent at an ivy league college, a poor person among the extremely wealthy. Add to this the cultural differences someone from another country would experience and you have a glimpse into college life that not all students would normally see.
