Especially when they are like this: \" \"I don't want to be a simile anymore,\" I said. \"I want to be a metaphor. \" This book lived up to all my expectations. No, it did not quite knock The Scar off its Mi\u00e9villish pedestal but it came pretty damn close to it. ( Hey, Catie, we both agree on that! ) I loved it so much, and yet when a colleague politely asked what it was about (when I told him I stayed up half the night before taking call to read it) I could not figure out how to describe it in a few words. So I'll remedy it now. What IS this book about? It's about language,<---M> of course</---M>, or rather - Language. It's about the inevitable and destructive culture clashes. It's about the painful casualty-filled struggle between the New and the Old. It's about the allures and the dangers of power. It's about inability to escape politics. It's about love and friendship and betrayal. It's about a surreal fantastical world in the best sci-fi traditions. It's about the easiness with which even the formidable things can get destroyed by slightest mistakes - mistakes that can destroy worlds. And all of this is done with the usual Mi\u00e9ville flair and love for weirdness - albeit Mi\u00e9ville slightly toned down as compared to his Bas-Lag works. \" Language, for the Ariekei, was truth: without it, what were they? An unsociety of psychopaths. \" How about I try to give you a glimpse of the plot? It's Mi\u00e9ville's forage into the sci-fi territory. Set on a far-away planet (in a galaxy far far away), it's a story narrated by Avice Benner Cho ( the ABC of this language-centered book ) , a native of <+++>Embassytown</+++>, a human outpost on a planet inhabited by the Ariekei (The Hosts), the alien race whose lives are ruled by the Language - which IS the reality and the thought rather than merely a way of expressing the above. There are no lies, they are not possible, they are inconceivable. ... ...........................Sorry, I couldn't resist.................. \" I differ with myself then agree, like the rock that was broken and cemented together. I change my opinion. \" There are no metaphors. There are only similes - as literal as they can be, and very necessary in this literal world. Avice Benner Cho, for instant, is a Simile - \"a girl who was hurt in the darkness and ate what was given to her.\" Only specially raised Ambassadors are able to communicate with the Ariekei. And it is this way - until one day an unexpected new Ambassador arrives. And everything goes to hell. \" A world-destroying mistake. Not a stupid one: only the very worst luck. \" <---A>China Mi\u00e9ville</---A> once again does what knows how to do best - gives the readers an amazingly vivid and weird bit of worldbuilding, creating the environment that is so alive and real despite - or maybe because of - its inherent strangeness. On this canvas he layers the story of war and destruction, the power struggle with the appeal and danger of politics, and brings in the colonizers vs. the colonized relationship perspective - from the weirdest angle imaginable. And it works, as usual, full of CM's captivating storytelling magic. It's all-immersing and impossible to put down. And in reaching into the depths of this story, taking in the message that is being spoken to me, I'm LIKE a girl who ate what was given to her. I'm NOT unlike a girl who ate. I AM a girl who are what was given to her. (Hehe, that was fun! Misused, yes, but fun). \" Before the humans came, we didn't speak so much of certain things. We were grown into Language. After history we made city and machines and gave them names. We didn't speak so much of certain things. Language spoke us. The words that wanted to be city and machines had us speak them so they could be. \" The Language, albeit described in such a fascinating way, is only an excuse, a background, a way to make the reader reflect on the power dynamics and the attempts to reconcile the old and the new, the culture that is brought in and the culture that already exists. What is better - the purity of what is already established or the allure of the unknown that leads who knows where? How much stake can we put into championing what we think is right, what we think there should be? (view spoiler) [And speaking of championing what you think is right - I loved what was done with the character of Scile, the admirer of the way Ariekei lived their lives. He subverts the common trope of an outsider stepping into the world and realizing the power and rightness of the tradition of the 'natives' and championing it successfully. Scile's role gets turned on its head, he becomes a fanatic with a noble but unsustainable mission, and I love this turn of events. Because he is wrong and yet not entirely wrong. \" It's not the Ambassadors' job to understand the Hosts,\" I said. \"So whose is it?\" \"It's no one's job to understand them.\" I think that was when I first really saw the gap between us. \" (hide spoiler) ] There's not a correct answer to the above question, even in the light of Mi\u00e9ville's uncharacteristically optimistic ending (but in all honesty, once I read it again I realized how much hidden bittwersweetness it holds, and how much potential for badness there is even in this optimism). \" I never, in <+++>Embassytown</+++>, the immer or the out, had the constitution for the intrigue. Floaking, I'd hoped, was a way around it. But politics finds you. \" And a special applause goes to CM's protagonist, Avice Benner Cho. She is a very strong and brave character, and yet is rather calm, low-key, and even somewhat detached. She is self-sufficient and resourceful, level-headed and determined, and I love all of that. She has a very healthy attitude about life, and it's very refreshing to read the story in such a voice. She does what needs to be done, without whining, without needless deliberation, without any extra drama. After all, she is the girl who ate what was given to her. She is like... well, many things. And that is vitally important. -------------- I loved this book immensely. It is the second sci-fi book revolving around language that I've read this year (The first was Delaney's Babel-17 ), and it spoke to me, referring to so many things that I care about. It was a great read, an amazing book from a favorite author, and yet another proof that China Mi\u00e9ville can succeed at writing about anything ( c'mon, he already successfully wrote about space elevators after all! ). 5 stars! \" We speak now or I do, and others do. You've never spoken before. You will. You'll be able to say how the city is a pit and a hill and a standard and an animal that hunts and a vessel on the sea and the sea and how we are fish in it, not like the man who swims weekly with fish but the fish with which he swims, the water, the pool. I love you, you light me, warm me, you are suns.

While reading this book, I thought about language. I haven\u2019t really thought about it from the standpoint of it not existing or that it is something to be discovered, like traces of gold in a California riverbed. I don\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t have language. The ability to express myself has served me well. Not that I haven\u2019t said the wrong thing or said the right thing at the wrong time, but I usually have the ability to explain further and give what I say deeper meaning. I can change minds and can have my mind changed by exchanging words. Language is the foundation of who we are. The Ariekei did not have language before the humans arrived. They were a hive of sorts, able to communicate without spoken language. The humans refer to them as The Hosts, which is exactly what they are. They allow the humans to build a city named Embassytown. I can remember the first time I went overseas and spent nine days in Italy. I didn\u2019t know the language but always managed to find Italian people who spoke enough English for us to communicate with each other. After having nine days of barely speaking any English, certainly a lot less than what I was used to, my arrival at San Francisco Airport was, for lack of a better term, a system overload. My mind was so starved for the English language that all the filters or barriers that I normally have for sorting language were gone. My brain was attempting to listen to and process every ongoing English conversation that was within my range of hearing. My cat...the weather was...I bought these new shoes...Do you like this coat?...Will they serve us a meal\u2026What did he mean by that? I was catching just pieces, most of them jumbled together as my mind was trying to sort each conversation, but without success. My cat was new shoes like this mean. It was like touching the edges of insanity. The Ambassadors who are sent to interact with The Hosts are paired. They have two minds that make one voice. They are identical and kept that way. When one gets a scar that can\u2019t be healed, the other is given an identical scar. They are rarely apart, and when circumstances do part them, they are lost in much the same way I\u2019d feel if my left arm and leg just detached from my body and walked into the next room. Very interesting, I would think to myself, and then I would try to finish typing this review with one hand. Our heroine is Avice Benner Cho, who is an immerser who has just returned to Embassytown after years of deep space exploration. She cannot speak to the Ariekei, but she has become a part of their language. They call her\u2026 \u201dThere was a girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given her.\u201d As things become more unstable between The Host and the colonists, Avice wants to evolve in their language. \u201d\u2019I don\u2019t want to be a simile anymore,\u2019 I said.\u2019I want to be a metaphor.\u2019\u201d The interesting thing about Avice is that she really isn\u2019t a hero. She is more like a professional traveller who sits in the hip cafes, eats the unusual food, sees the sights, goes to parties, and occasionally has a brief sexual encounter with someone interesting. She has been married several times. Sometimes to women, sometimes to men. In Embassytown, she has sex with ambassadors which... since each one is actually plural... means she is a very busy girl during those encounters. Her experiences while travelling have evolved her thinking about what is strange. One of her best friends is a digital presence that can move from one droid to another. Like us all, she does struggle with seeing things that go beyond just exotic, those things that go beyond a frame of reference of what we know. For us to be comfortable, new things have to have something about them that allows us to have at least a handle of understanding. \u201dOnce I heard a theory. It was an attempt to make sense of the fact that no matter how travelled people are, no matter how cosmopolitan, how biotically miscegenated their homes, they can\u2019t be insouciant at the first sight of an exot (slang for exotic) race. The theory is that we\u2019re hardwired with the Terre Biome, that every glimpse of anything not descended from that original backwater home, our bodies know we should not ever see.\u201d The world that China Mieville creates in this book is in some ways vague, certainly unsettling. The world building takes a backseat to exploring the concept of languages and their value. Though he does give us glimpses of what this world looks like. \u201dWhen they regrew the city the Ariekei changed it. In this rebooted version the houses segmented into smaller dwellings and were interspersed with pillars like sweating trees. Of course there were still towers, still factories and hangars for the nurturing of young and of biorigging\u2026. But the housescape we overlooked took on a more higgledy-piggledy aspect. The streets seemed steeper than they had been, and more various: the chitin gables, the conquistador-helmet curves newly intricate.\u201d As the Ariekei learn language from the Ambassadors, things take a sinister turn as segments of The Host population begin to become junkies. \u201dAmbassadors are orators, and those to whom their oration happens are oratees. Oratees are addicts. Strung out on an Ambassador's Language.\u201d Where my addiction to language happened over a long arc of time, comparable to beginning with marijuana to evolving to cocaine to finally needing heroin, The Host\u2019s addiction begins with heroin and wants the next better thing than heroin\u2026 NOW . Things get scary \u201dWe knew the Ariekei would breach our defences. They entered the houses that edged our zone, found their ways to rear and side doors, large windows, to holes. Some came out of the front doors into our streets and tore apart what they found. Those with remnants of memory tried to get to the Embassy. They came at night. They were like monsters in the dark, like figures from children\u2019s books.\u201d A war over a need for language. I don\u2019t know how else to say this...the book is brilliant, simply brilliant. I\u2019ve been a long time fan of China Mieville and will eventually read everything he has ever written. The concepts he explores in this book had me thinking about my own relationship with language, with learning, with my addiction to hearing and being heard, to writing my thoughts and to reading what others have written. I once knew a woman in Phoenix whose grandfather walked out to get the morning paper, poured some coffee, and flipped the paper open, like he does every morning, to start reading. He couldn\u2019t read. He\u2019d had a small targeted stroke during the night that erased his ability to read. The thought still sends a shiver down my back to think that I could lose the ability to read or the ability to speak or the ability to hear. I\u2019m a junkie for language. You will have to have patience with this book. Mieville circles the plane over Embassytown and just drops his readers into the city. Shortly after stowing your parachute, you are going to feel out of kelter, exposed, behind a step, and will begin to feel nervous that you won\u2019t catch up. You will. With every chapter, you will begin to know more pieces of the puzzle until you are eventually able to assemble a shimmering vision of this city, these people, and the situation which has lit the fuse to a powderkeg.

This was the third Mieville I\u2019ve read, and they are all very different in style, content and my liking (or not). The core idea of this one is language: how minds shape language and how language shapes minds. Wonderful as it was, I can see reasons why some people would hate it, or find it too weird, or just not sci-fi enough. If you don\u2019t delight in polysemy and are not interested in the difference between simile and metaphor, this is unlikely to be the book for you. Because of the tantalising style of storytelling, drip-feeding the reader snippets about things from the trivial to the fundamental, it\u2019s definitely a book worth rereading, and that is especially true on the subject of language, to which I\u2019ve devoted a whole section of this review (which I will doubtless need to rewrite after a reread!). The plot is to some extent secondary, but it is the reminiscences (going back to childhood) of a woman from Embassytown who travels, comes back and becomes enmeshed in the extraordinary Language (capital letter) of the alien Hosts. FIRST IMPRESSIONS The first section left me exhilarated but reeling. It was so vague and yet specific, nearly familiar, yet also strangely different, and in such an enticing way. It hints at all sorts of weirdness that I couldn't quite put my finger on (odd units of time and some odd typography in the pages ahead) and others that I couldn\u2019t even get my head around (what are \u201calien colours\u201d- related to Douglas Adams\u2019 Hooloovoo, a \u201csuper intelligent shade of the colour blue\u201d?). Even the names and numbers of the sections were hard to fathom, making the reader as disoriented as an ambassador in an alien land. This teasing bafflement continues throughout most of the book: Mieville doesn\u2019t pad with early exposition, so the reader is fed occasional snippets about what things mean. Sometimes I wondered if I\u2019d missed something, particularly things that were clearly fundamental to the book (e.g. what was special about the Ambassadors, what the Hosts looked like, and what being/performing a simile means) but as I read on, and gradually learned more, I realised that was just part of the style of the book. Having just read Mieville\u2019s The City & The City ( http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... ), I was also struck by parallels: there is lots about borders, separation, boundaries, outsiders, the strange duality of the city (\"the Host city, where the streets changed their looks... not quite a hard border but was still remarkably abrupt, a gaseous transition.\") and one character is \"cleaved\", when cleavage is a significant aspect of TC&TC. SENSE OF PLACE Embassytown is a trading outpost used by humans from Bremen and Earth (Terre) in the future. It is on a planet inhabited by the Ariekei, more respectfully known as Hosts. They have a unique Language (view spoiler) [that requires two simultaneous voices from one mind (hide spoiler) ] , and the Ambassadors are the translators. The Hosts are also experts at biorigging, so many aspects of the city and its technology are appealingly bizarre, giving a very strong sense of place, even though some aspects are left to the reader\u2019s imagination. The immer is more amorphous concept of space or outer space, and Avice\u2019s first experience of it is \u201cimpossible to describe\u201d. \u201cThere are currents and storm fronts in the immer\u201d as well as borders, but the usual laws of physics, and even direction, don\u2019t apply. For instance, \u201cin the first one [universe]\u2026 light was about twice as fast as it is here now\u201d and some places are closer together in the immer than in the everyday. \u201cThe immer\u2019s reaches don\u2019t correspond at all to the dimensions of the manchmal, this space where we live. The best we can do is say that the immer underlies or overlies, infuses , is a foundation .\u201d Also, \u201cPeople get lost in the overlapping sets of knownspace.\u201d NARRATOR Avice is an immerser (traveller of and in the immer). She isn't a fluffy, girly sort of woman, but I would have little interest in reading about her if she was. Even so, she came across as plausibly female to me, which is not something all male writers can achieve. She wasn\u2019t especially endearing, and in the middle of the book she was often faffing around, trying to find out what was going on, but not actually achieving much. In particular, there are some key plot points where she relies on hearsay (\u201cI wasn\u2019t there but that\u2019s how I was told it happened\u201d), which is brave decision on Mieville\u2019s part, though I think he just about retains her credibility. Despite those instances, she is central to the story, mainly in her childhood, and then towards the end of the book. THEMES Given that the Host\u2019s Language is thought and literal truth, the most obvious theme is the nature of truth and lies and the question of whether we make language or language makes us. See the section on Language, below. I don't think we're meant to have a clear idea what the Hosts look like: it's all about language/Language, rather than judging by outward appearance. Mieville drops little clues throughout the book, but it takes a long time to build up a picture, which remains somewhat fuzzy, but utterly alien. When newly arrived crew stare, unashamedly, at the Hosts, Avice recounts a theory that \u201cno matter how travelled people are\u2026 they can\u2019t be insouciant at the first sight of any exot race\u2026 our bodies know we should not ever see [them]\u201d (Of course, the vagueness is also a teasing tactic, which entices the reader to keep reading, and avoids distracting from the main force of the story.) Related to that is Ehrsul: an autom who is Avice\u2019s friend, albeit they rely on \u201call the exaggerated intimacies of our friendship\u201d. Scyle can never quite think of her as human enough to be friends with her, whereas Avice pushes any doubts to the back of her mind. Maybe an autom who is TOO realistic is more unsettling than one that is clearly not human? On the other hand, \u201cShe only ever used one corpus, according to some Terrephile sense of politesse or accommodation\u2026 having to relate to someone variably physically incarnate would trouble us [humans]\u201d and her apartment is decorated with pictures on the wall, so that visitors feel relaxed and at home. Would Ehrsul pass the Turing Test? The fact she runs on Turingware suggests she would, but perhaps it would depend who tested her, which then questions the whole nature of the test itself. Other aspects of what it is to be human touch more on Brave New World, and Soylent Green. In the latter case, the Hosts\u2019 natural \u201clast incarnation was as a food store for the young.\u201d Having given that up, they \u201crespectfully shepherd the ambulatory corpses until they fall apart\u201d, despite their \u201cdignified mindlessness\u201d. The former (view spoiler) [ relates to the way Ambassadors are bred: identical twins, raised to be able to think, act and, crucially, speak, as one, as that is the only way to be understood by the Hosts (hide spoiler) ] . Colonialism and all the socio-political and practical issues around it are central, though not my main area of interest. I saw many echoes of (view spoiler) [the Opium Wars, ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_wars ) (hide spoiler) ] a particularly shameful episode in British colonial history. I suppose the main difference is (view spoiler) [that the Language Ariekei were addicted to (albeit a corrupted form) was something previously regarded as unequivocally good. Does that change the ethics of addiction, drug-pushing, treatment (\u201cthey might not be addicted any more but they\u2019re not cured; they\u2019re changed\u201d), and do the means justify the ends? (hide spoiler) ] IDEAS ABOUT LANGUAGE This is the heart of the book, but so hard to do justice to, but I\u2019ll attempt it. HOSTS\u2019 LANGUAGE The Hosts\u2019 language (called Language) is the most important to the story, and it is wonderfully strange: it must be spoken simultaneously in two voices by a single mind: \u201cThe sounds aren\u2019t where the meaning lies\u2026 it needs a mind behind it\u201d. The Hosts themselves have two means of vocal output (cut and turn), but it\u2019s more of a challenge for humans to utter it in a way that the Hosts even register as speech, let alone understand. The other distinctive feature of Language is that it is an utterly concrete and literal language: lies and multiple meanings are not possible: \u201cFor Hosts, speech was thought\u201d and \u201cWords don\u2019t signify: they are their referents. How can they be sentient and not have symbolic language?\u201d Side-effects of the strangeness of Language are that the Hosts have no system of gestures nor of writing (Mieville accommodates the duality by writing simultaneous words above each other, like fractions). However, it\u2019s not quite so straightforward or static as that sounds\u2026 SIMILES The Hosts use similes to express things that are not literally true \u2013 the catch being that the similes themselves must be concrete and must continue to be true. (\u201cThe man who swims with fishes every week\u201d has to swim with fishes every week. If only the simile had been in the past tense, his life would be much easier.) Avice was a simile (\u201cYou speak Language. I am it\u201d), but others were examples and topics, and later, Avice declares, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a simile any more. I want to be a metaphor\u201d. One puzzle is how the Hosts know they need a simile, let alone define it, before they have it in Language? Similes are the thin end of the wedge where truth is concerned: \u201cSimiles start\u2026 transgressions. Because we can refer to anything. Even though in Language, everything\u2019s literal\u2026 but I can be like \u2026 anything\u2026 Similes are a way out. A route from reference to signifying.\u201d It\u2019s a relatively small step from \u201cYou are like x\u201d to \u201cYou are x\u201d. A metaphor is a step further: a lie that is the truth. LIES The Hosts can understand lies, and they also have a Festival of Lies, where they entertain each other by trying to lie. I was reminded Lister, in the comedy sci-fi, Red Dwarf, trying to teach the mechanoid, Kryten, to lie \u2013using fruit ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB-NnV... ). There are several tactics to lying; they tend to be incremental and often use similes: collaborative, going slow, going fast. But does lying have a moral cost \u2013 does it inevitably lead to evil? And what is \u201cevil\u201d in a non-religious place where some barely have a concept of the word? SAPIR-WHORF The ideas of Sapir-Whorf underlie much of this (that the structure of a language can affect the cognition of those who use it, see Linguistic Relativity ). \u201cWithout language for things that didn\u2019t exist, they could hardly think them\u201d, with \u201chardly\u201d being the crucial get-out. What about Hosts who lose the power of speech? \u201cIf they can\u2019t speak, can they think? Language for Ariekei was speech and thought at once.\u201d Do we make language or does language make us? As the book progresses, some Hosts have a strong desire for the former: \u201cWe want to decide what to hear, how to live, what to say, what to speak, how to mean, what to obey. We want Language to put to our use.\u201d Avice realises \u201cTheir longtime striving for lies [was] to make Language mean what they wanted\u201d. Another way of looking at it is whether \u201cLanguage is the continuation of coercion by other means\u201d, as one character claims, or whether it\u2019s cooperation, as another claims. A brilliant sci-fi short story that is also underpinned by Sapir-Whorf is Ted Chaing\u2019s The Story of Your Life , reviewed HERE (filmed as Arrival, November 2016). OTHER LANGUAGE-RELATED IDEAS Other odd languages are fleetingly mentioned, such as Homash: \u201cThey speak by regurgitation. Pellets embedded with enzymes\u2026 which their interlocutors eat\u201d. There is also mention of \u201cTactile languages, bioluminescent words\u2026 Dialects comprehensible only as palimpsests [a favourite word of Mieville\u2019s] of references to everything already said, or in which adjectives are rude and verbs unholy.\u201d The quirks of Language affect the writing of the book. In particular, are Ambassadors singular or plural? The answer is both, even in a single sentence, for example, \u201cAmbassador JasMin was in earshot and I made a point of asking them \u2026\u201d. This makes sense, the more you understand about them. The vagueness of some things, and the neologisms (see below) only added to the appeal for me: maybe I became a little addicted to Language? There is a wonderful passage describing the joy of a Helen Keller moment, when one who lacked the power of communication suddenly \u201cgot it\u201d. A trivial surprise was that in a largely non-religious future society Christian-based swearing continues in recognisable form, \u201cJesus Pharoahtekton Christ\u201d, whereas I\u2019d expect the words to have morphed a little (like \u201ccrikey\u201d). Finally, I\u2019m not enough of a linguist to be sure of the truth of this, but it\u2019s thought-provoking: \u201cSometimes translation stops you understanding.\u201d SOME VOCAB Most of the coinages are thrown at the reader early on, and there is no glossary (this isn\u2019t one either). However, the meanings are usually clear from context and common-sense etymology: Shiftparents, voidcraft, exoterre, biorigged, immerser (versus landstuck), plastone, bookware, newsware, alt reality, sidereal, monthling, basilisking (I love that one), oratee, augmens, datchip Less obviously: Floaking: \u201cthe life technique of aggregated skill, luck, laziness and chutzpah\u201d. Trid: This seemed to cover quite a lot of things, but all involved a video player/display. Miab: An acronym (view spoiler) [ Message In A Bottle, i.e. cargo from afar. (hide spoiler) ] Floak is my favourite, and I think Mieville is fully aware of its appeal and the perils of overuse: \u2018\u201dDid they tell you I can floak?\u201d I said. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never told them that fucking word\u2026 they just want the opportunity to say \u2018floak\u2019.\u201d\u2019 I also like the fact that \"exot\", which refers to exo-terre (of or from Earth) conjures strong implications of \"exotic\".

This one you have to unfold for yourself. So: China Mi\u00e9ville does sci-fi. And huzzah for that! (Dear George Lucas and/or James Cameron: You cannot have him. Fuck off) I was a bit worried last year, after Kraken didn't work for me, that China's next venture wouldn't fly. But it does. It's a bit jumbled, like most other Mi\u00e9ville stories, because he has his own worlds to set up and his own rules to go with them, and his own language to tell it with (with more language layered throughout, in this one), so it opens slowly and takes its time to get to the story. And he spends some time jumping back and forth, from formerly and latterday, which I think could have worked better divided into separate parts (indeed, the \"Formerly\" chapters seem to exist as a novella, a somewhat-prequel dealing with the first [failed] revolution of the Hosts), but that's minor quibbling. It's a great story. It's a great exploration of language, familiar and alien. And it's great Mi\u00e9ville too. 2009 brought us The City & the City . 2010 was Kraken . Now we have Embassytown and the short story \" Covehithe \" for 2011 (which I hadn't fully read before I linked it here, but ohmygodguysyougottafuckingreadthis). If China keeps up with this one-a-year habit (Dear Chuck Palahniuk: Surrender now), I can't wait for 2012. It's becoming an old joke, I know, but I'm still holding out for chick lit. Update: It's been a few weeks since I finished Embassytown , and I still keep thinking about it, so I'm going to take that as a sign that four stars isn't enough. Rating adjustment ahoy!

But dear, enthusiastic Mrs. Muench could not have anticipated China's sophistry: metaphors are lies. Embassytown is a deep-thinking book, not one to pick up if you are in a the mood for a fast action read. China's use of a futuristic language, coupled with representation of an alien speaking that tongue (in a form that looks disturbingly like a fraction equation), requires attention to detail, an ability to read for an hour or two at a time. Along with altered language, he throws in the isolation of a human city in the middle of an alien world on the edge of known space; altered biology, in an alien race that somehow biologically fuses/grows their mechanical needs out of organics, including their homes; and an alien race that not only speaks with two mouths simultaneously, but cannot lie. Further complications come from his solution to deep space travel, by way of the immer. The challenge for both races is in communication. In order to communicate with the alien Ariekei, two people have to speak simultaneously, mimicking the double Ariekei mouth. But since the Ariekei also sense the thought/mind behind the word, two different people speaking the same thing makes no sense to the Ariekei, so the solution was to raise human clones to function as Ambassadors to the aliens. Forget Being John Malkovich. I'd like an hour in China's mind. Overall, I found it a fascinating, immersive read, reminding me strongly of The Dispossessed --and that is highest praise--although he doesn't always have LeGuin's kindness in contextualizing most oddities. Still, it's well done, and balances the personal and the political well. He taps some eternal truths in the midst of alien outlandishness: \"As I've grown older I've become conscious of how unsurprising I am.\" There's a sly sense of humor occasionally tempering the seriousness: \"I knew something would (happen) as certainly as if this were a last chapter.\" It shows again in the initials of the lead character's name: \"A.B.C.,\" fitting in a book about language. There is tenderness and compassion, however alien, when one of the self-aware bio-machines downloads herself into a new body, just so she can give Avice a hug. The crux of the novel lies in the Arikei limitation to speak literally. Avice becomes part of their language when she takes part in an event, thus allowing the Arikei to use her as a simile. It is a fascinating and fun idea (ever wonder about the first cat out of the bag?) that allows China to play with the definitions of truth, lies, language and meaning. However, language evolves, and interaction with the humans is starting to push the Arikei language to it's limits. Avice ends up pushing them even further. \"I don't want to be a simile anymore,\" I said. \"I want to be a metaphor.\" He unfolds the examination of language within both Avice's own life when she brings her linguist husband home to her world, and the politics of her province-city. China's genius shows when he throws in issues of addiction and identity into the mix. Why not five stars? It is not a comfortable book. It could have been tightened up a little bit; as I work my way through the review, I marvel at all the things China tried to accomplish, and wonder if he should have limited a variable or two in favor of greater coherence. Was the immer necessary, for instance? There's interesting hints at Avice's friendship with an autom/biological robot as the biological systems break down, but I'm not sure what role it really played, and if it just confused the story further. Still, an impressive work, and likely to be a classic. Interesting quotes: \"Beside him, Ez was like a ventriloquist's doll, existing only when he spoke, or was spoken through.\" The army of hopeless and enraged had been driven to murder by their memories of addiction, and the sight of their compatriots made craven to the words of an interloper species. That degradation was the horizon of their despair.\" Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0... ...more The girl who wanted to be a metaphor.

The box may even be a prop from a Justin Timberlake Saturday Night Live inspired skit. The reader just does NOT know what he or she is getting into. This brings us to Embassytown. This was my fourth Mieville novel, so I was prepared for the WTH? queasiness \u2026 or at least I thought I was. As I type these words, I ponder at the socio-economic, psycho-theological tumultuous environment that produced Mieville. Ponderously, I continue. To say that Mieville produces weird fiction would be an easy label, as Mieville has affixed that to himself, but it would also be grossly understated, and overly simplistic. He produces wildly fantastic, imaginative works that scratch nails on the boundaries of what we expect in fiction. Just as Philip K. Dick developed a studied weirdness in Galactic Pot-Healer , so too does Mieville in Embassytown; he is trying, and succeeding in breaking new ground. But this is not to say that he is being strange for strangeness sake (see Alfred Bester\u2019s Golem 100 for an example of a spectacularly failed experiment). Embassytown is cogent and correct as to its own world building. What is it about? What is a simile and what is the distinction between one and a metaphor? Science Fiction is best when it is an allegory, and Mieville has figured that out with interest. At once a cool and smart far future alien colony story, it is beneath the surface about political and personal communication. Where else can we read a personified symbolism of speaking out of two sides of your mouth - by an alien with two mouths? Or double talking politicians who \u2013 double-talk? Of oration that is not just persuasive, but intoxicating, even addictive? Standing on the shoulders of giants, Mieville describes bio grown factories and commercial goods that reminds me of John Varley\u2019s Gaia trilogy and an alien culture that cannot imagine a lie is reminiscent of the Fair Witness from Robert A Heinlein\u2019s Stranger in a Strange Land . Finally, the tone and style could have been lifted from the pages of Frank Herbert\u2019s The Dosadi Experiment . All that said, this is Mieville\u2019s accomplishment and it is a fine work. Not an especially easy read, but fun, well written and representative of Mieville\u2019s unique place in the genre. ...more Proem: In Which an Ambassador Iangrayetiates Himself With His Host With Impunity Is a simile Like a metaphor?

A Story about Language In a way, every work of fiction is about language, at least to the extent that it applies language to the telling of a story. However, China Mieville\u2019s \"Embassytown\" is about the very nature of language and how it both separates and bonds people. At its heart is a deep knowledge of linguistics (far greater than my superficial understanding). However, Mieville\u2019s special talent is to weave this knowledge into an exciting adventure story based on linguistic concerns. It\u2019s a fascinating novel in the way some of us might have been fascinated by Umberto Eco\u2019s \"The Name of the Rose\" or Don DeLillo\u2019s \"The Names\" (note the word \"name\" in both titles) or would have been fascinated if a decent writer had got their hands on the religious and historical themes behind \"The Da Vinci Code\" (not \"name\", but \"code\" this time). If Tom Hanks can star in a film of an unfilmable novel like \"Cloud Atlas\", then surely he could help bankroll a film of this novel? Now that I think of it, if that novel was an Atlas, then this one is a Thesaurus. It\u2019s about what we can learn about humanity from the differentiation, synonymity and antonymity underlying language. The Language of Diplomacy Embassytown is a diplomatic enclave in a City on another planet ruled by the Ariekei or Hosts. There are human and other Ambassadors and Diplomatic Staff here and, as is the custom, they have to find ways to communicate with each other, despite language differences. In the ordinary course of events, there could be disputes, and resolutions have to be developed, negotiated and agreed. It is the nuts and bolts of diplomacy that we mere mortals can only dream of. \"Ambassadors speak with empathic unity. That\u2019s our job.\" [I once dreamed of being a diplomat and took a university course designed to qualify me for entry, but they started taking diplomats hostage around this time and I lost some of my enthusiasm. Still, I socialized within a diplomatic community for several years.] Language As She is a Spoke in the Wheel To the extent that a common language (such as English) is not used, diplomacy must operate at the intersection of two or more languages. We have to observe and respect nuances and exercise caution so as not to offend our hosts with inadvertent connotations or discourtesy. We are always on tenterhooks or tender hooks. You can imagine that when two languages first encountered each other, a lot of work had to be done to identify commonalities. Was the grammar similar? What words meant the same thing? What are your words for \"dog\" or \"girl\"? What are our words? It Semed Like a Good Idea at the Time This is where a knowledge of semiotics might help an understanding of the novel. Let's use the word \"dog\" as an example. The word is a \"sign\" or a \"signifier\", and it \"signifies\" what society knows to be a dog. The social understanding of the concept relies on convention. But a \"dog\" could mean a whole lot of different types of dog, which are all within the convention. These \"dogs\" are all within the scope of the \"signified\". The words are therefore signs or vessels that carry meaning that is influenced by society and convention. If I say \"dog\", however, I might be thinking of my dog Charlie, who is small and white, while you might think of your dog, Wilbur, who is big and black. Our language is flexible enough to accommodate this personalisation of the signified. Ariekei Thought and Speech Contrast this with how the Language of the Ariekei Hosts operates. The word for them is a funnel or a \"referent\" to the original thought. This thought occurs within the mind of a Host. Host-on-Host communication is therefore, presumably, much closer to unadorned or unmediated thoughts communicating through funnels. If a Host \"said\" dog, its thought might actually be small, white Charlie dog, and the funnel or referent would ensure that another Host saw and understood small, white Charlie dog, consistently with the thought. The meaning or signification of the word wouldn't be [as] social or conventional. It would be more specific to the \"speaker\" or \"thinker\". Indeed, it\u2019s arguable that there is only \"referral\" and no \"signification\" at all. We leapfrog the social and conventional, and go straight from thought to thought. Hence, the Hosts' \"speech is thought\". What Lies Beneath a Language This linguistic process lies beneath the Ariekei fascination with similes and, ultimately, with lies. The transparency of their thought dictates total sincerity, therefore an inability to lie. \"This\" must mean \"this\" and \"this\" only (not \"that\" or \"more than this\"). A simile requires one thing to mean or imply another. A simile therefore requires social convention to imply meaning into the words of a speaker that a listener can infer. The Ariekei just do not get and cannot replicate this process Similarly, the Hosts can't think of a concept without Language. As a result, they can't conceive of falsity. To be confronted with a lie is an impossibility that is capable of giving them a brain explosion analogous to an addictive psychedelic \"god-drug\" experience. Abstraction, Action and Interaction Behind the Language The process also raises the issue of what they can imagine: \"What imaginaries any of them could conjure at all must be misty and trapped in their heads.\" How can they think without words? Are they just taking \"snapshots\" of the Real? Can they entertain abstract thought? Are they limited in what they can think and speak? Is their world primarily one of action in the real world, not so much abstraction within the world of the mind? Does the primacy of individual action limit collective or social interaction? Can there only be dispute and coercion without cooperation? Language Channels Into Sects and Cults This is pretty much the back story of the novel. The front story is intimately concerned with these ideas, and to say more would risk thematic, if not plot, spoilers. Suffice it to say that a lot happens at the intersection of the two languages. And it involves interaction, misunderstanding, dispute, negotiation and more. At a macropolitical level, there is a sense in which language is shown to be an agent or vehicle of control. How we think limits our potential and our aspirations. The restraint on thought breeds obsession, which is channeled through religious and political sects and cults. It is difficult to achieve informed unity and community: \"Those rebels must be a fractured community, without speech, if they were a community at all. Language, for the Ariekei, was truth: without it, what were they? An unsociety of psychopaths.\" Freedom and vibrancy require change, and the novel is a dynamic exploration of the change that can occur at the interface. Woman as Simile Just as linguistics and political philosophy inform \"Embassytown\", consistent with China Mieville\u2019s earlier novels, there is an explicit promotion of and support for the active role of women in social and political life. The narrator is a woman, Avice, who describes herself as a \"floaker\", a more dynamic version of a modern-day \"slacker\" who embodies \"the life-technique of aggregated skill, luck, laziness and chutzpah that we call floaking.\" In the eyes of the Ariekei, she is their principal simile: \"The girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given to her.\" Yet, despite the technical linguistic interests of her sometime husband Scile, Avice is the true social and emotional vehicle for the communication and rapport-building between the disparate groups and the progress of the narrative. She is effectively both communicator and problem-solver, not to mention a pretty adept flirt. Notwithstanding her lack of overt ambition, she would make a pretty good diplomat, if not one necessarily obedient to the powers that be. Ultimately, what appeals to me so much about China Mieville is his ability to juggle sophisticated intellectual themes, genre demands, convincing worlds, interesting characters and well-paced adventure action. While the themes of the novel are within my core literary and cultural interests, I admired his skill at bringing the project together with such aplomb. I was always conscious that there was a puppeteer making this entertainment happen, but he has an uncanny knack of doing it in such a way that you don\u2019t notice him or the strings. I\u2019d like to call Mieville a \"floaker\" of some sort, but as Avice\u2019s lover, Bren, says of her at the end of the novel: \"You\u2019ve never floaked in your life.\" Genesis (A Very Old Woman's Tale) (Thanks to Spanish Dancer and Weaver) In the beginning was god. There was just it, and it was alone. Well, it had to be because it was everything. God was a genius, but there is no point in being a god-like genius, unless there is company who appreciates it. So god made woman, to reduce its workload. It intended woman to be the origin of everything else in the universe, which had formerly been god. Woman would take what had been god and turn it into something else. The presence of woman was required to make a difference. So woman differentiated between things. Having made things, she decided to invent language and words, so that she could give everything a name and put everything in its place. Woman rejoiced once this was all done, but it was not enough. She needed a challenge. She thought about it for a few days and nights, at which point she decided to make man. She was feeling reckless. Her intention was to make something almost her equal, but not quite, with whom she could flirt, after which she could birth and care for a child. Upon the arrival of man, woman looked at him and could not determine whether her project had been a success. Woman decided not to make it too easy for man, so she played hard to get. Eventually, man worked out that the way to get woman\u2019s attention was to call her a goddess and worship the very ground she walked on, at which point both woman and man lost interest in god, and it retired hurt. While woman was birthing, man also lost interest in woman, and never really worshipped her the way that he had beforehand. Having espied his face in a pond, man liked what he had seen, and decided to revive and re-make god in his own image. He then made a church with other men and excluded woman from any secret god business. By this time, woman had realised that when man said she was like a goddess, it was only a simile and he did not mean that she was the real thing, even though a simile is a kind of metaphor. Many years later, woman made a man called China Mieville for her own entertainment. China is cute, sensitive, strong, intelligent, talented and has tattoos. He knows what a simile is, but he also knows how to treat a woman as a goddess. Man is still trying to work out why woman is reading so much genre fiction. China Mieville continues to write, while man ponders his predicament. SOUNDTRACK Roxy Music - \"More Than This\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9PAuW...

This book is very different than almost anything else I\u2019ve read from China Mi\u00e9ville. Where some of his other books seem to have this crazy frenetic energy, this constant flood of new ideas and creative imagery, this one feels more focused and streamlined. And while I\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of the high-speed bizarre rides he\u2019s taken my brain on, I fell hard for this story. Like The City & The City , this one gave me time to sit with his ideas. It gave me time to examine them from different angles, to bring them home to my own experiences and make them mine. That\u2019s not to say that this book isn\u2019t highly imaginative and bizarre \u2013 I mean, this is China Mi\u00e9ville, after all. I tried to explain the premise of this book to my mom last night and I sounded completely ridiculous (she humored me though, because you know\u2026she\u2019s my mom). Those of you familiar with this author will know that you can trust him not to just come up with some vaguely human-looking people, add a few odd characteristics, and call them aliens. His aliens are genuinely alien. The Ariekei have a genuinely alien point of view, which is described with a vividness that can only come from complete imaginative dedication by the author. They have a genuinely alien appearance, which Mi\u00e9ville only partially describes, because it\u2019s just not important. The most important thing about the Ariekei is their Language. Language for them is not so much a way of communicating, but a way of seeing. They speak things to make them real. Everything they \u201csay\u201d with their strange, harmonizing dual voices is therefore literal. I won\u2019t say much more, because I think the way that Mi\u00e9ville reveals each facet of their culture and Language is completely absorbing and I don\u2019t want to ruin that for anyone. Yesterday, my friend Maggie left this gif as a comment on one of my reviews and I thought: I am like the dog in the kitchen, who wanted to eat a cupcake but couldn\u2019t. I AM the dog. And I get to decide why. Never before have I really stopped to think about how often we speak our truths with imagery, symbols, and lies. Also, this book makes my thoughts sound completely insane. If you haven\u2019t read it, you're probably thinking I\u2019m a crazy person right about now. Which is why this review is definitely not going up on the blog. You\u2019re welcome, people of goodreads! Here\u2019s my best shot at describing what this book is about: It\u2019s about a girl who grows up in a distant, alien place and becomes a part of its landscape, its Language. It\u2019s about a woman eventually earns her way into the out. It\u2019s about a traveler who reluctantly returns to her birthplace and finds something to fight for. Like so many of Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s works, it\u2019s about revolution. The path to new worlds is so often paved with blood and wreckage and the bones of lost traditions. But sometimes all that carnage and violence can become the fertilizer for something strong and new. \"... the noise of old ways coming off in scabs. Pangs of something finishing, and of birth.\" I wish I could speak Language so I could say and express all of that as one simple sentiment. I wish I could say to tell you about the journey of Avice Benner Cho. ------------------------- I know this wasn't absolutely perfect but I find it impossible to give it anything but 5 stars. I think The Scar is still my favorite Mi\u00e9ville but this one's an extremely close second. I may write a longer review someday when my life is less crazy, but for right now I can wholeheartedly recommend this book. If you're a Mi\u00e9ville fan, this is one of his best. ...more I see I'm going to be a dissenting voice here, but I'm afraid I found Embassytown to be weak, poorly-plotted and fundamentally unconvincing. The book is concerned with a settlement on a planet at the edge of the known universe. The city is inhabited by Ariekei, a strange species whose distinguishing feature is a unique language which has a double articulation and in which it is impossible to lie.

A small enclave of humans lives there, and communicates with their \u2018Hosts\u2019 via a series of Ambassadors \u2013 two people bred to think as one, who, by talking simultaneously, can communicate effectively with the Ariekei natives. So far so good. Unfortunately, a lot about Mi\u00e9ville's world here just doesn't add up. The narrator, Avice, is special. She's an \u2018immerser\u2019, born with special abilities to navigate the \u2018immer\u2019, or sub-space underlying the known universe. We hear all about how unusual this is, and the special training she receives to be able to navigate vessels through the vast reaches of space this way. Then, the whole concept is dropped and never reappears in the novel again. The whole thing turns out to have no bearing on the plot whatsoever (apart from a very tangential callback during the climax). Avice and other characters keep banging on about how she has these special, unique abilities \u2013 but they are NEVER called on and have no relevance to anything. Obviously I don't expect everything to tie together at the end, but this was just bizarre in its pointlessness. The language element of the plot, too, irritated me. I am no expert, but linguistics is an interest of mine and the ideas on display here seem deeply unconvincing. A couple of vague references to langue and parole are not enough to back up some very shaky concepts. The whole idea of a language where you cannot lie is very problematic, if not impossible: certainly it requires far more explanation than we are offered here. Saying that it is a language where \u2018words are referents\u2019, far from convincing me, only made me feel that Mi\u00e9ville doesn't know what he's talking about. It really makes no sense to say (as we are told in the book) that the Ariekei employ humans to perform certain specific actions just so they can then speak of them as similes, this being necessary because unless something has literally happened they would never be able to express it in their language. To ask for these actions to be carried out in the first place, they must be able to formulate the idea in advance and express it to someone. This is actually pointed out by a character in the book, but no one, including the author, bothers to answer the question despite the fact that it's clearly a major flaw with the entire set-up. Then there's the fact that the d\u00e9nouement depends on large chunks of the Ariekei population suddenly learning to lie practically overnight \u2013 not only that, but they invent an entire writing system in a single afternoon. Give me a break. I just didn't believe any of it. The City and the City had its flaws, but it was a much better-written novel than Embassytown , and I'm at a loss as to why so many people seem to think this is his masterpiece. The plot is all over the place, and the theories underlying it are dodgy in the extreme. It's just not a particularly great book (and that ain't no lie). ...more Some books are just made for readers.

Language informs us, sways us, entertains us, engages us \u2026 it is everything to us. Science fiction seems, to me, like a perfect vehicle for exploring our dependence upon language. After all, there has been a great deal of speculation about how we would communicate, if at all, with other intelligent forms of life. Assuming we could recognize that they are intelligent, how do we establish a common frame of reference? It\u2019s not like learning a new human language, where we have common memes and ideas, not to mention a shared neurology and physiology that makes our languages quite similar. (I\u2019m trying to come up with other examples of fascinating twists on language but drawing a blank on this hot summer day. There\u2019s the episode of TNG featuring a language based entirely on metaphors. Feel free to add more examples in the comments!) OK, I dug out the fan and am ready to continue. Basically, Embassytown is about the quixotic relationship between humans and the Arieke, or Hosts. Unlike any other species thus far discovered, the Arieke vocalize out of two holes instead of one. Their simultaneous vocalization forms singular words and phrases\u2014and for the Arieke, Language is literal in the sense that words don\u2019t actually signify anything other than themselves. As a consequence, Arieke cannot lie, because they can only speak of what is. They don\u2019t have the words to do otherwise. To use figurative, comparative language, they need living examples\u2014similes. These are people who do or have done something that can serve as a comparison for the state the Arieke wants to refer to, but that person has to be present when the Arieke wants to make such a statement. Avice Benner Cho grows up somewhat feral on the streets of Embassytown. When she reaches adulthood, she becomes an immerser\u2014some kind of spaceship pilot or navigator\u2014and leaves the planet behind, returning only at the behest of a man she meets and marries, because he is obsessed with the Hosts and Language. Through Avice we see the complicated relationships between the people of Embassytown, the Staff at the embassy, and the clone Ambassadors who replicate Language as best as humans can. Avice is a simile; she is an outsider; and she is also a native. I struggled a lot with Embassytown . Newcomers to Mi\u00e9ville might chalk that up to his writing and to the difficulty of understanding what he means as he discusses Language and the ways the Hosts differ from us. I know better, though\u2014it\u2019s not Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s ideas at all that are the problem; they are grand and wonderful and truly thought-provoking at times. No, it\u2019s his characters. At least for me, the problem has and always will be his characters. I don\u2019t know if it existed in Perdido Street Station and I\u2019ve only gradually clued into it, but I noticed it with Bellis in The Scar , and it was far too obvious in Iron Council . Avice just spends most of the book not doing anything. She has an interesting, albeit confusing incident at the beginning of the book as a child. Then she skips planet for a few years, growing older, meeting people, returning to Embassytown with Scile in tow. But she\u2019s always on the edge of the story, watching things happen, passive. It annoys me, these sorts of protagonists. I want to run up to them on the street, grab them by their shoulders, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re letting the story pass you by! Go do something!\u201d Eventually, towards the end of the book, Avice takes my advice. She finally clears her head, realizes there is a crisis going on, and develops a plan. It\u2019s a damn fine plan, if I say so myself, and what\u2019s even better is that it works \u2026 mostly. Watching Avice step up, take charge, and take the lead was the best part of this book, and it really recharged my flagging interest. I just wish it had happened a lot sooner. The crisis, by the way, is also quite clever. Somewhat reminiscient of Snow Crash , it involves rendering the Language into a kind of drug that infects the Arieke (not to mention their genetically-engineered technology). This dramatically changes the status quo on the planet in a way not even the instigators of the plot had predicted, destabilizing diplomatic relations and leading to the brink of war\u2014as well as civil war. Avice\u2019s solution involves radical alterations to the way Arieke use Language. It\u2019s revolutionary but necessary. In this respect it\u2019s obvious that the Arieke are in for a big change as a result of Avice\u2019s interference. Yet I never got a clear sense of what they are leaving behind. Mi\u00e9ville describes the Arieke language and the barriers to communication it creates, but he spends precious little time devoted to descriptions of Arieke culture and society. How are they stratified? What is their history like? Do they have spaceflight of their own? The only cultural event we ever see is the Festival of Lies, and that is an artifact of human\u2013Arieke contact, not something indigenous to them. Without delving deeper into the nature of Arieke society, Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s portrayal of them is little more than the background necessary for flogging his linguistic speculations. Embassytown has all the makings of a good book, but I just didn\u2019t enjoy it as a story. Mi\u00e9ville is a great storyteller\u2014he knows how to break people down and build them up again; and he can make bad things happen like no one\u2019s business. But in this case, there was nothing here into which I really sank my teeth. Avice was not, for the most part of the book, compelling as a protagonist. None of the minor characters held my attention. So I wandered, bereft of an anchor, through a sea of explanation and exposition about the Arieke and Language. It was like reading an interesting but fictional textbook on an alien culture. Judging from other reviews, there\u2019s definitely love to be had here if you can rustle up more sympathy for the characters or more interest in what\u2019s happening. I just kind of let it pass me by. I suppose this lack of enthusiasm is what everyone who regularly does not enjoy China Mi\u00e9ville books feels. There were good moments, exciting moments, but for the most part Embassytown read somewhat like the Language it\u2019s about: words without a lot of meaning. ...more Embassytown is that rare thing in recent literature: unique. I'm sure there must be other books, other stories that deal with similar ideas, but I have yet to come across anything that comes close to the beautiful strangeness of this book. There are cons: Embassytown is far from perfect. Like all of Mieville's work that I've read so far, it is hard work (especially at the start) but it does get easier as the story begins to grip you. This is not a comfortable, lazy read. Sometimes I found that t Embassytown is that rare thing in recent literature: unique.

This is not a comfortable, lazy read. Sometimes I found that that languaging was so alien - or conversely, so familiar - that I was jolted right out of this strange world and found myself contemplating the language choice rather than the story. This is not necessarily a negative; it could, in fact, be part of the author's intended reaction. \"Language\" is such a deep part of the plot that there is no reason to discount the possibility that the very writing itself was used in such a way to make the reader think about our own human forms of language. Be that as it may, it was distracting. Coupled with this was the tendency to write as though the reader was already knowledgeable of the world and universe in which Embassytown is set. A second re-reading of the book may be in order, because there are so many parts from the beginning that I didn't comprehend and I think that detracted from the latter parts of the story. That being said, I did in fact enjoy the fundamental story so much that I will happily undertake a re-read in the near future. Because oh, the story! The ideas! A dissection, an exploration, a near poetic discovery of what constitutes language and sentient interaction - this is at the heart of Embassytown. There are many other threads woven throughout (addiction, politics, oppression, morality, the essence of humanity) but Language is the core. I will never again be able to look at similies and metaphors in the same light. As with Railsea, the ending hit me so hard it was almost physical. In fact, the ending - if I may go so far as to say - was perfect. I will be very surprised if this never finds its way to motion image - whether in film or television (or even pure art) form. Like the world in which it is set, Embassytown is ruggedly, alienly beautiful; flawed and (mostly) imperfect; unique, and essential. ...more SPOILERS There is no subject, not love, religion, sex, music, that generates more quasi-mystical but ultimately senseless gushing than.... language. I liked this book quite a lot, and wanted to like it more; but I was so unable to credit its central conceit, the Hosts' \"Language\", that I have to judge the book something of a failure. Here are some of my problems with it. Language (capital L) both is and is not a language.

Here are some of my problems with it. Language (capital L) both is and is not a language. (Fans of the language mysticism in this book might prefer that I wrote the first conjunct of that sentence on top of the second instead of after it.) The Hosts finally make a change, as the narrator Avice puts it, from Language to language. So Language cannot already be itself a language. Yet, Language is spoken, between Hosts and between Hosts and Ambassadors, it enables communication, exchange of technology, so it must be a language. You cannot lie in Language; and its native speakers can only understand it spoken by other natives, or by specially reared Ambassador pairs speaking in tandem. But no means of communication itself makes lying impossible. And how can the Hosts' inability to understand Language spoken by non-Ambassador humans be a feature of Language, rather than their own psychological strangeness? The Hosts make people into similes. I just don't understand what that means. They \"say people\". I don't understand that either. It's not that somehow the Hosts are incapable of abstraction, and need something concrete, a real person or event, because of inability to abstract. They do abstract and use concepts just fine, apparently. The very similes themselves involve abstractions \"the girl who ate...\" involved being a girl, and eating, both purely general. In fact, if anything, their limits, Avice intuits, lie in the direction of concretion. They cannot say \"that\". But their inability is no more a simple inability to refer to particular things than it is an inability to use concepts. They clearly have what philosophers call singular or de re thought. They think and speak about particular things, the girl who ate what was given to her, for example. So they evidently have no problem individuating individuals of various kinds. So what exactly does the ability to demonstrate things, with \"that\", add? Certainly nothing world-changing; a mere convenience at most.\"Concepts without intuitions [i.e. singling out of particular things] are empty; intuitions without concepts are blind\" said Kant (or was it the other way round?). But the Hosts have both concepts and intuitions. So what exactly is their problem? A lot is made of a distinction between reference and signification. Both terms have been given a plethora of meanings in different philosophical schemes; it was unclear to me what the distinction between them was meant to be here. Well, I could go on; but of course, this wasn't meant to be a text-book in the philosophy of language. The most interesting aspect of the novel, given the failure of its main goal in my opinion, was its treatment of colonialism. The Embassytowners are a colony of Bremen; but they themselves have an initially symbiotic relation with the Hosts that soon turns to one of pure colonial domination when they accidentally make addicts of all the Hosts. I loved the way the Hosts fractured in their responses to this overlordship; some collaborate; some look to free themselves constructively (by going beyond Language); the most frightening turn to self-mutilation to make themselves immune to the power of the overlords. Even here, though, I wasn't quite satisfied; it is the \"white man\" (actually, woman with Korean surname) who helps them help themselves. Without Avice's efforts, and those of her companions, the Absurd, the army of the self-mutilated, are set to rampage and kill, as restless natives are always ready to. (The woman who teaches them all about language has the initials A.B.C.! One thinks of native children laboring over language primers.) Still, as I said at the beginning, I liked the book quite a lot and will almost certainly read more of the author's work. ...more This is my first Mieville, and my first foray into his \u201cweird fiction\u201d as he likes to call it.

Our Hosts have two mouths and \u201cLanguage\u201d needs both saying different parts of words and sentences simultaneously. Obviously, this is a little difficult when us mere humans only have one mouth. No problem you say, just use recordings or robots to simulate two voices in harmony. Nope. Our Host\u2019s don\u2019t hear sentences, but the sentience behind the sentence. AI\u2019s don\u2019t cut it, even though they pronounce words perfectly, because they aren\u2019t truly sentient. How about two separate humans preparing their lines and speaking in unison? Still no good. Apparently, our hosts can\u2019t hear us unless Language is coming from a single mind. So how do we communicate with the Ariekne (our Hosts)? How do we do trade? Because they have some pretty cool stuff. They make living machines and accessories. Fliers that are alive. Leather goods grown straight of the tree. Food and necessaries that gets delivered to us through a pipework of living intestines and gets shat out to us through an actual anus on the other end. Oh yeah. Anyway, Mieville builds up a story and world around this central concept of Language (what we call the language of our hosts) gradually rolling out the rules and syntax allowing the reader to explore this new world and concepts. Another aspect of Language is that Hosts can\u2019t lie. They can\u2019t think in anything other than literal truths. How then do you think certain thoughts without the use of say similes? They don\u2019t. They know they need similes to think certain thoughts, but they have to make similes literally true before they can use them. It turns out, us humans are very good for being similes. They make certain of the humans perform specific actions, making them true, so they can refer to them as similes \u2013 and so there are humans in Embassytown who are incorporated into Language. The first part of the book where we discover Language, and this new planet, and Embassytown, and how we travel through space, was just fascinating. Even the animals are weird. Like the \u201ctrunc.\u201d A small animal that tears itself in two if attacked. The eyes and balls run one way while the teeth and arse stay behind to distract and attack the predator so the eyes and balls can live on to mate another day. Who thinks this stuff up! Coming into the second half of the book a lot of the rules of the world and Language are established to the point that you should be fluent in a manner of speaking that you would otherwise be clueless about. Mieville then proceeds to make Language a simile, or maybe a metaphor, for his own views on politics, religion, political correctness and more. I don\u2019t subscribe to Mieville\u2019s socialist politics or views on most things, but I can at least appreciate how he communicates them as the sub text in the story. The story and plot itself didn\u2019t do a whole lot for me, but they are really only there to showcase his ideas and concepts and imagination centred on Language. I am totally captivated by his style of writing and look forward to Mieville weirding me out some more in his other books.

His ability to create worlds, characters, histories, storylines and all the elements required to develop such complex novels is really astounding. In Embassytown we follow Avice [forgive me for any spelling errors in this review, I listened to the audiobook and he uses some really weird words], a woman who is returning to her home city as an adult. We get some back story about how she was mythologized in the native alien population, called \"ariekei,\" through the development of their language. The civilians of Embassytown speak with these ariekei, also known as 'hosts,' through the Ambassadors who are born & bred to speak the native's language. I'll stop there because it's complex and you'll find it all out as you read the book. At the center of the story, then, is of course the ideas, concepts and even theology of language. Again what I appreciate about Mieville is that he doesn't sacrifice good narrative and creative settings to deliver a thought-provoking story. He blends both together to create something wholly original. And while the plot overall was sometimes hard to follow--it took me a solid hour of the 12 hours in the audiobook to orient myself to the culture, language and unfolding events--I was never bored. Avice is a great protagonist. And I thought Mieville paced the story perfectly, doling out vital information at just the right moments. My only qualm with the novel was that, like I mentioned, it does take a while to orient yourself in the story at the start. That could be a result of listening to the audiobook as opposed to reading & seeing all the strange words and events on a page. Nevertheless, I was pretty impressed with this one and already plan on diving into more Mieville, hopefully sometime soon. ...more 3.5 stars I think I'm going to have to submit to a higher power for this one.

Avice, a human simile and \"the girl who was hurt in the dark and ate what was given to her\" (don't ask; it's important but I couldn't begin to explain it to you), gives us an intimate look at her home town, a colony populated by humans, Ambassadors (genetic clone-y twins, not exactly conjoined but linked by brainwave) exported from distant Bremen (the place that colonized Embassytown), and Hosts (these weird Arekei bug-like creatures with eye-stalks, carapaces and wings. All co-exist semi-peacefully, until the arrival from Bremen of an Ambassador named EzRa, sent to (I think) control the populace by means of language (or Host-speak \"Language\", a language devoid of lies or speculation, one that requires speaking two words at once).

Imagine the withdrawal symptoms of these buggy Hosts when these words are taken away...

La novela nos sit\u00faa en Arieka, un planeta remoto habitado por los enigm\u00e1ticos ariekei y que los humanos han colonizado. Estos seres utilizan una lengua totalmente ins\u00f3lita en el universo que solo un reducido grupo de embajadores es capaz de comprender y comunicarse con ella. Cuando un nuevo embajador del extranjero llega a Arieka, el equilibrio en el que la Urbe y la Ciudad Embajada conviv\u00edan se ve profundamente trastornado. Embassytown no es para nada una novela de aventuras, es un entramado sobre sociolog\u00eda, filosof\u00eda y lenguaje que el autor utiliza para explorar el choque de dos culturas dentro de una historia de ciencia ficci\u00f3n. Meti\u00e9ndonos in media res de la historia puede hacer que el inicio sea duro, bastantes conceptos y cosas que no podemos comprender y que pueden llegar a aturullar un poco al lector. Personalmente ha sido solo una primera impresi\u00f3n, dejando fluir la lectura todo (o casi) acaba cobrando una satisfactoria explicaci\u00f3n. Si algo me ha fascinado de la lectura ha sido la ambientaci\u00f3n. Conceptos como el Inmer, el Idioma, las armas biotrucadas, las casas biol\u00f3gicas hechas de musculo o la utensilia nos har\u00e1n volar nuestra imaginaci\u00f3n. Aparte de ello el autor se encarga en indagar en el lenguaje, en hablar sobre las diferencias entre significado y significante, en como este puede transformar la realidad m\u00e1s de lo que pensamos. Este Idioma pasa a ser el personaje principal de la obra en detracci\u00f3n de unos protagonistas que son meras herramientas o desencadenantes para poder transmitir los mensajes que el brit\u00e1nico quiere. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que la primera mitad que me ha parecido excepcional la novela decae un poco. El autor dedica demasiado tiempo para mi gusto a divagar en subtramas intrascendentes para la historia y que ralentizan el gran ritmo que llevaba. Sin embargo, eso no hace que la obra sea interesante en todo momento. Menci\u00f3n aparte para la gran traducci\u00f3n de Gemma Rovira, sin la cual esta obra ser\u00eda algo que no tendr\u00eda ning\u00fan sentido para el lector. ...more This is why I read China Mi\u00e9ville ! I recently finished The Scar and was thoroughly disappointed, giving it the lowest rating I've given to one of his books. So, I felt I just had to jump into Embassytown , and loved it from the start. SF is full of \"aliens\", but for the most part they're odd-looking humans, or at least \"people\". They're not really all that alien. Mi\u00e9ville's Ariekei are not only completely alien, he never even really clearly describes their appearance - it just isn't that important. This is why I read China Mi\u00e9ville !

Mi\u00e9ville's Ariekei are not only completely alien, he never even really clearly describes their appearance - it just isn't that important. The Ariekei have a unique form of language - so unique, it's called Language! Each of the Ariekei speaks with two voices simultaneously, and is incapable of even understanding that a single voice can actually be Language. Embassytown delves deeply (and at times almost opaquely) into the meaning of meaning, from semiotics into semantics, and into the difference between simile and metaphor. Along the way, we're asked to take sides on the fall from grace in the Garden of Eden - are we (or the Ariekei) better for the knowledge of Good and Evil, or worse? Mi\u00e9ville's position is clear, and I stand with him. It's not an easy read, especially the later chapters, but it's well worth every ounce of effort you put into it. ...more A great accomplishment in a central theme of science fiction, that of humans blundering their way toward fuller communication and understanding of an alien species.

Despite some plodding of the plot in the middle and a struggle to accede to the overlying premise of the tale, this was well compensated for by good engagement in the fate of in-depth characters, plenty of ingenious invention and atmospheric conveyance with the details, and fascinating reflection on how very different species may have to change their nature to comprehend each other. In this tale, the lead character Avice is returning to her home world and city in response to her new husband's interest in the language of the aliens who built Embassytown, the Hosts. Their language works without referents, as words do not stand for things or concepts, but instead speech is their means of effectively being thought. This is the premise that's hard to grasp, but Mieville spends a lot of time building up its plausibility for the reader. Another challenge to communication is that the Hosts speak through two different orifices in a kind of double-speak, and any single-speaking being, artificial intelligence, or recording is perceived only as noise by the aliens. Thus, the Hosts come off as baffling and seemingly harmless, but they are of moderate commercial interest due to their facilities in bioengineering a city with a living infrastructure. Without giving away details of the narrative, it is fair to say that the efforts of the more powerful humans and Host factions create an extreme crisis in their relations. The novel's journey and resolution is a different kind of achievement than that of space opera. \"Embassytown\" is more accessible than other work by the author in being a more conventional tale. Some will miss Mieville's \"experimental\" writing, but here the stretch to comprehend the Hosts is enough of a nut to crack that the plain prose is a relief. ...more Of course I've heard of China Mi\u00e9ville.

Check out the blurb: In the far future, humans have colonized a distant planet, home to the enigmatic Ariekei, sentient beings famed for a language unique in the universe, one that only a few altered human ambassadors can speak. Avice Benner Cho, a human colonist, has returned to Embassytown after years of deep-space adventure. She cannot speak the Ariekei tongue, but she is an indelible part of it, having long ago been made a figure of speech, a living simile in their language. When distant political machinations deliver a new ambassador to Arieka, the fragile equilibrium between humans and aliens is violently upset. Catastrophe looms, and Avice is torn between competing loyalties\u2014to a husband she no longer loves, to a system she no longer trusts, and to her place in a language she cannot speak--but which speaks through her, whether she likes it or not. 1. I have no idea what that \"living simile\" thing even means. 2. I can still understand it's (part of) quite a conundrum. 3. And the whole thing sounds pretty damn cool. Will report back. *signs off* ...more I was thrilled to find a copy of Embassytown at the library a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, I only made it through about 40 pages before I had to return it. Those were a tough 40 pages that really hurt my brain. At some point, I realized that my problem was less about the book than about the fact that I just couldn't hear it right in my head.

The narrator makes the story so immediate, like you're really listening to Avice tell it to you. The way the production handles the Hosts' language really adds to the experience. I really don't know how many stars I'd give to the book in print, but the audio is worth every one of those five stars. ...more Fascinating look at the way language underlies thought, action, being, done in a way that only science-fiction really can.

I kept getting distracted by other books (mostly poetry), so reading this took longer than most books do, but that shouldn't be interpreted as a lack of recommendation. Embassytown is about language. I kept hearing that, and assumed it was code for \"China Mieville uses big words.\" And while that is true, including several he makes up on his own (like 'floaking'), there is so much more. Embassytown is the name of a civilization on an alien planet on the edge of the 'immer,' the explored part of the universe. It is still populated by the natives, Ariekei, who for a long time were unable to communicate with their visitors, a language barrier of sorts. Among the solutions is that some of the visitors are turned into living similes. Avice Benner Cho, who narrates the story, is a simile the Ariekei know as \"The girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given her.\" Avice has recently come back to Embassytown with her newest husband, and that is when there is a problem with one of the Ambassadors. I can't say much else; it would give the story away. But it is innovative and I enjoyed reading it. \"As I've grown older I've become conscious of how unsurprising I am.\" \"Look instead at a map of the immer. Such a big and tidal quiddity. Pull it up, rotate it, check its projections.
