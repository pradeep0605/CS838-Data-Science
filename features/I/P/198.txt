Because it teaches us why life is worth living. I would change nothing about this book. Nothing! I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Mark Bramhall. The narration is slow, but it should be slow so you can think about every word, and ponder what those words mean, consider what we think ourselves. Would this happen, this way? Would I react similarly? Could he behave any differently? You can see from the book description that this is about a small group of disparate refugees - a German gentile blond haired girl and her mother and brother of ten, an English prisoner of war and a Jew disguised as a German officer \u2013 crossing Germany from east to west in the final day of the war. Running from the Russians, the Germans and what fate has in store for them. Each character represents a different cultural / political stamp. Each carries their own baggage. Every action they take is molded by their history and where they come from. And yet each one is a person and that binds them / unites them. And that is why we readers can relate to this book, because we are all people like them. If I say to you - remember The Invisible Bridge . That is a book about the war that everyone loves. Well this is better, by far. There isn\u2019t one unnecessary word in this book. Please read this book. I have no question in my mind whether it deserves five stars. Yes, it does, without a doubt. Beautiful prose, lots to think about, humor, realistic plot line, perfect beginning and ending. Never does it drag, not for one second. Please read this book. Or listen to it. Read it or listen to it soon . Choose it for your very next book! Please. Barbara, you pushed me to read this book. I owe you big time. Thank you! ...more Rating: 0.125* of five GHASTLY.

The plot summary below was taken from Wiki\u2026 but put it all together better than I could. [image error] The plot of the story centers around a young Prussian girl, Anna Emmerich , and the broken remnants of her family as they flee westward from the advancing Russian army. Along with them they bring the Scottish POW, Callum Finella , with whom Anna has embarked on a secret love affair. As Anna, her mother, her younger brother Theo, and Callum trek across the Third Reich, other stories run parallel to theirs. [image error] There is the story of Uri Singer , a Jew that leapt off the train to Auschwitz and survives by assuming identities belonging to various German soldiers. [image error] And then there is Cecile Fournier , a French Jew taken prisoner in a concentration camp and, along with her fellow prisoners, forced to march westward to outdistance the Russian advance. [image error] Eventually all three stories come together when Anna's party, joined by Uri, crosses paths with the sad march of Cecile and the other prisoners. Throughout the novel, Anna struggles with the ideas of the atrocities the Nazis have committed and how she can possibly bear the burden of blame by the rest of the world. *** Cecile to Uri: \u201dI thought we were all going to die.\u201d \u201cYou and all the other prisoners?\u201d \u201cNo. The Jews.

Experiencing their pain, their grief, their hunger.. their hopelessness. I know this is a heavy subject to read about, and it is not usually my go to book for pleasure. But this is that book that EVERYONE should read at least once in their lifetime. We all need to be reminded\u2026 not only of what these people went through, but also of what we all take for granted. It baffles the mind how incredibly evil some humans can be. \u00a0And on the other hand, it is amazing how resilient and strong the human soul can be. \u00a0How is it that some individuals crumble and collapse at the most insignificant trivialities, and others defy unfathomable atrocities and find ways to survive. Sometimes I think that if there weren\u2019t people left alive to tell their stories, or horrific photos documenting the unspeakable truths, it would be hard to believe these things could have ever happened.

I grimace at some of the descriptions, but I am reading this book with interest. Finished late last night again. Mutti (the mother) is an interesting character. She believed in the Fuhrer, even had a crush on him, and Bohjalian's descriptions of her disillusionment and heartbreak as she learns the truths are real. To believe so trustingly in your government and leader and learn the horrific truth must have been devastating and horrible for the many good German people. Uri is a complex character, strong, conflicted, yet focused. I loved Theo and could just see his little earnest trusting face, becoming more confused and yet knowing as the family traveled further west.

So, in a way, this book was the opposite of fantasy-seeing how the various characters in their different situations dealt with the war is what connected me to them. There was a German family fleeing from the Russians and a Scottish POW traveling with them, a young Jewish woman in a work camp, and a Jewish man disguising himself (usually) as a German soldier. I feel like I went on a real journey with these characters and the end of the story was brilliant and heartbreaking, as a true war novel should be. ...more <+++>Skeletons at the Feast</+++> was my second <---A>Chris Bohjalian</---A> novel.

It's a very busy time, and I may not be able to get much reading done. The main thing that drew me to the book was the title. It's just one of those titles that scream in your face. So, what did I think? While, other than the slightly slow start, it was a great book. I sure wasn't disappointed. It's the sort of book that opens a person's eyes wide to the horrors of war. My favorite characters were Mutti and Theo. I admired Mutti for her strength and Theo for his bravery. He was such an innocent little boy with such a love for animals. It was heart-breaking when he had to leave his favorite horse behind. The only problem I had with the novel was it's odd structure in the first fifty pages or so... hence the slow start. It seemed to lack punctuation so the sentences went on forever, which made it hard to read. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. I gave it a solid four stars. ...more Skeletons at the Feast took me to a dark place - the Holocaust. If there weren't so many great books written about this black mark of the world's history, I would ban myself from reading any books on this topic in the future. I hate that such a horrific occurrence is repeatedly used as bait for novelists.

I hate that such a horrific occurrence is repeatedly used as bait for novelists. Bohjalian is a good author, though, and does a good job developing his characters, giving them interesting conflict, all the while threading bits of real history into his story that he obtained through diligent research. I'll give him credit for all of the above. However, part of me felt like Bohjalian decided this was going to be his one and only time to write about the Holocaust so he was going to put it all in one book. The details he gives about the atrocities committed by the German soldiers, the Russian soldiers and the desperate and destroyed left in their wake is so graphic, so skin-crawling brutal that it borders on gratuitous. Including as much as he does has the opposite effect from the one I imagine the author intended and his book almost becomes a WWII caricature. I'm not saying the things he describes didn't happen. No, he seems to have read enough journals and letters to give each horror story credibility, but to include them all -- in the same book, witnessed by the same characters in the space of about a year -- it made these disturbing acts of cruelty seem made-up. I feel it was a disservice to take someone's real life nightmare and diminish it by setting it alongside so many other nightmares so that they all seem somehow....less. Because that is what happens. The first description was like a punch in the stomach, the next a slap on the face and all the rest...swats on an already numb backside. As much as I wanted to, I didn't dislike this book. Bojahlian creates a complicated story about the fallout from ignorance, naivety, and privilege found among the rural aristocrats of Poland and Germany near the end of the war. Not forced to witness the daily disappearance of Jews and other minorities, the Emmerilich family was living in relative peace and prosperity, along with their polite relationships with the POWs helping out on their beet farm, until the ugly consequnces of their fuhrer's decisions found their way to the family's country manor, Kamenheim. Anna, The Emmerlich's teenage daughter, falls in love with Callum, a scottish POW, and convinces her parents to allow him to remain with their family instead of sending him back to the prison camps. As Callum and the Emmerlichs flee the approaching Russian troops, the blinders of this family's eyes are removed and they finally see first hand the destruction throughout their land. Along their west-bound journey, they meet and become dependent upon Uri, a young, vigilante Jew posing as a German soldier in order to survive. There is an additional, competely separate story involving a french, Jewish girl named Cecile who is trying to keep herself and her friend, Jeanne, alive while prisoners in a concentration camp that does eventually intersect with Uri and the Emmerlichs but not soon enough to be satisfying There are plenty of lessons to learn within the pages of this book, but I can't say that it is one I recommend. The author tries to write too many stories at once-- a romance, a look at Nazi sympathizers, stereotypes the Polish people had of Russians, allied prisoners of war, a coming of age story, the gore and sadism of war, Jewish resistance, Jewish survival and an unnecessary epilogue, to make this novel truly great. ...more Based on real diaries, this is a fascinating subject, but mishandled. Bohjalian seemed to be trying to hit readers over the head with the horrors of WWII. \"You forget pain. We all do.

As they travel, the bond between the three deepens to unexpected levels as they battle the terror and cruelty of a war strewn country. Hot damn, was this a beautiful yet heartbreaking book. On one hand, witnessing the relationship between Anna and Callum was and the friendship between the three companions was intensely satisfying and wonderful. On the other hand, this story also brutally details the fear and horror of what it meant to live through that time period. I felt as if my heart was on this crazy roller coaster of emotions! It was a heart pounding book, even in it's quiet moments. It brings such a human aspect of the war, to see these people struggle and survive against all odds. All in all, a wonderful and very enjoyable book! ...more Blech. I have heard such good things about Chris Bohjalian, but I must say I was deeply disappointed. This book was based loosely on an actual journal kept by a German woman who fled the Russians as they swept into Germany at the end of World War II. The plot had such great potential!

So many issues though. 1. The character development was stale. The characters didn't change over the course of the novel, even in the face of life-changing circumstances (loss of loved ones; leaving one's home behind never to see it again; a difficult, dangerous journey over several months, political upheaval...). These are all things that change a person, but somehow the characters here seemed to arrive at the end of the novel in exactly the same way that they started. Why did we not see more evidence of the guilt that Anna and Mutti MUST have been feeling? Why was there less exploration of Uri's search for his family and the way that changed him? What about Callum, didn't HE feel guilty? He did basically desert his unit, and he did manage to escape actually having to engage in conflict. 2. Unecessarily graphic violence much? I think we all get that the Holocaust was a terrible time in history- people endured horrible, horrible things. Do we have to hear the intricate details of brains being spilled out or inhuman brutality? The details were a little over the top and didn't seem to add to the story enough to make them useful. 3. Weird sex scenes. So they've been marching for months, Anna is exhausted beyond words. She finally gets to sleep in a bed with blankets for the first time in recent memory. You could almost feel how warm and comforted she felt. Then Callum wakes her up in the middle of the night so they can see the Northern Lights, when they (naturally!) have sex. Outside in the frigid cold. When she is recovering from pneumonia or whatever it was she had. When he is an enemy soldier that could be shot if caught out in the open. Sounds plausible to me! And comfortable. Don't bother with this one. I hear Bohjalian's other books are good. Hopefully they are better than this one. ...more this audio book has me running back to the car to take a drive... anywhere, anytime, just any opportunity to listen to more.

A powerful and gripping book and I am completely swept up in the harsh, difficult and brutal refugee reality.

The storyline about Anna and her family's slog west was the more bearable narrative to me. They had an ostensible destination -- maybe not just one precise destination, but you knew they were heading west ... ahead of the Russian onslaught (if, at times, barely). Cecile's character's experience was so hard for me to stomach ... she never knew where she was going. She had no known destination -- so much despair (even though she was remarkable in the face of it). Really good read, really good reminder. ...more This is the fourth book by Chris Bohjalian that I have read and it is my favorite.

I have read a handful of other books set during this time period that were able to express the tragic and brutal violence, without leaving me feel numb. His characters were not very well developed, which coupled with the in-your-face savagery, left me not caring very much for the character's well being. The end of the book, I felt was rushed. As with other books that rush the ending, it seems the author is tired of writting the story and just wants to be done. Overall, it was a fast read and mildly entertaining. I am glad I checked this out at the library, rather than spending the money on purchasing it. ...more This was hard to put down even during the very graphic scenes of death and violence.

I loved every moment of this book. Chris Bohjalian brought to life, in vivid reality, this horrific period of history that is still so unimaginable; it's still so unbelievable that these atrocities actually happened. Through the various character's eyes the reader was able to experience the emotions during this time period. From death to life, despair to hope, grief to love, hatred to kindness.

A family of well-to-do German farmers, the Emmerichs, living in what was then the western part of Poland, leaves their comfortable farm just ahead of the Soviet tanks and seeks refuge with the Allies. With them is a Scottish prisoner of war, Callum Finella, whom the Germans allowed to work on the Emmerichs' farm. Uri Singer, a Jew known by various aliases, has escaped from a train heading to Auschwitz and lives by his wits, doing things he never would have thought he would ever do. A group of female concentration camp inmates is herded on a forced march from the camp toward the west to work in factories that will aid the Reich. It is a horrible trek with cruelty and privation. Some parts of the book are unbearably cruel. When I came to the first passage that illustrated the inhumanity of the human race, I asked myself, \"Why did he have to put that in?\" And then I said, \"You idiot! Because things like this happened!\" No matter how many books, fiction and non-fiction, that I read about the Holocaust, I continue to be saddened by how cruel and hateful people are capable of becoming. When I read the part about the women in the concentration camp, I was reminded of Gerda Weissmann Klein's book All But My Life . Then I got to the acknowledgements at the end and I found that the author had read and been moved by that book. I hope that Mr. Bohjalian has had the opportunity to meet Mrs. Klein and to hear her speak. I was lucky enough to meet her and was impressed with her message of hope in the human race, despite what she endured during the War. The ending of the book was satisfying. Rather than give anything away, I will say that books about the Holocaust rarely give \"happy\" endings. But like in real life, we learned what became of some of the characters, but not all. While some might find that frustrating, remember that in war there are people that disappear and we never know what happened. I have read almost all of Chris Bohjalian's books now, and I am never disappointed. His characters are believable, his story lines interesting, his descriptions vivid, and his research thorough.

A Prussian family, a Scottish POW assigned to work on their farm, and a Jew disguised as a Third Reich soldier attempt to escape and try to stay well ahead of the fast-approaching Soviet army. Tales of atrocities to which the Soviet army has subjected their prisoners is enough to force the group on their way west through a countryside ravaged by war. The novel also tells the story of Cecile a Jewish woman captured in her homeland of France and sent to a forced labour camp. I have read quite a few books on the second world war and on the Holocaust and they always shock and sadden me and make me question how human beings can inflict such pain and horrors on each other in the name of war and while this is a difficult book to read as the author does not spare us any of the horrors, it is an good historical novel. The plot for this Novel is haunting and quite a page turner, this is really a character driven novel and the characters are so engaging that they will stay with you long after you put down the novel. An emotional book that will shock and sadden even the most hardened reader. While this is a story of love in the time of war the horrors of war far outweigh the love story. This is only the second novel I have read by Chris Bohjalian and I will be adding more books by this author to my list. Quote \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that\" Quote by Martin Luther King, Jr. ...more Chris Bohjalian is a master of getting inside the heads of his characters. This WWII novel feels very much like fist-person accounts of the final year of the war in Prussia/Germany. We get the picture from the perspectives of German refugees fleeing the Russians, a Scottish POW traveling with them, a Jewish man masquerading as a soldier and a Jewish woman in a work/death camp. Much of the story is gruesome and all of it is tragic, but there's enough heart and humanity to keep readers engaged. Bo Chris Bohjalian is a master of getting inside the heads of his characters.

It can enhance and enlighten what you may already know. Chris Bohjalian \u2019s Skeletons at the Feast provided a viewpoint that many may have not thought about. It made the book a very dramatic and powerful read. After reading my first Bohjalian book, The Light in the Ruins , I was expecting Skeletons at the Feast to be another well-written book. I thought he manages to capture a myriad of emotions such as hope, resiliency, anger, and fear in his writing. I was really drawn into the trials and tribulations of the Emmerich family as they travel west as refugees. While you would think the story would be becoming confusing with the different perspectives, Bohjalian ably handles seamless the shift between them. It doesn\u2019t take away from the tone nor the momentum that has been previously built. I actually enjoyed reading the different views and thoughts of each character which brought depth to the story. Regardless of your own thoughts about the book, you cannot say that the book itself was badly written. What I appreciated most about this book was the angle/view the story was told from. You often have heard/read stories that was told by those in the front lines or civilians who were close or at the heart of the fighting. But we often forget about those who who live in the isolated countryside who don\u2019t know exactly what is occurring at that time. It was interesting to see those like the Emmerich family deal with what they are hearing and trying to come to terms of what their people are doing. It brings up the question of responsibility and forgiveness for a population who didn\u2019t have anything to do with the actual happenings but are part of the group who were perpetrating the atrocities. Furthermore, through their eyes, you see how violence and cruelty were occurring on both sides. As a reader, you can clearly identify the fear these rural Germans had of the Russian army. You realize that in wars, cruelty can also exist within the \u201cgood\u201d side. After a slow beginning, Skeletons at the Feast becomes a book in which pulls you into its moving and powerful story. At times, the book can be difficult to read since you are reading one of the most horrible time period in human history. But while it\u2019s heart wrenching, they make what those like the Emmerich family survived even more amazing. Bohjalian wrote a beautifully moving book that provided another aspect of WWII that was both engaging and enlightening. He has become an author who I\u2019ve come to expect to give me intriguing and poignant stories. ...more Bohjalian ventures into the milieu of World War II Germany and tells the story of Anna Emmerich, a German girl living on the edge of Poland and her German family, who are Nazi party members. These are rural German's who are oblivious to the atrocities and turn a blind eye to the disappearances of people around them to relocation. It is the last days of the war, and the family is forced to flee before the oncoming Russian army.

These are rural German's who are oblivious to the atrocities and turn a blind eye to the disappearances of people around them to relocation. It is the last days of the war, and the family is forced to flee before the oncoming Russian army. Accompanying them is a Scottish POW named Callum Finella who is given to her family to help work the farm, and a Jewish man, Uri Singer, who escapes the Nazi's by cleverly posing as one of them. The story is unusual in being told from the point of view of the Germans (although this is the second such book I have read recently and not through any design to do so). Perhaps the tales of the Allies and those of the Holocaust victims have been exhausted and at this remove we can be more open to the stories of how the insanity of Nazi Germany affected everyday Germans. The story is told masterfully, without any feeling that anything included is unnecessary or left out. Bohjalian amazes me with his ability to tell stories from so many different eras, with such disparate characters and yet to always seem knowledgeable and at home with his subjects. Stories such as this must always be told, lest we forget how devastating such a war can be and to help us remember that even among the monsters there are people who are just caught up in the circumstances created by others. ...more A disappointment despite the intriguing subject matter. I was excited to read about this period from a new perspective, but this didn't work for me. The violence seemed overly gratuitous and graphic in parts (particularly in the first half). Of course, when I picked this up, I was expecting to read about the horrors of war, but I don't think the author handled the subject very well. I understand these atrocities really happened, but it seemed like Bohjalian felt he had cram in as many of them as A disappointment despite the intriguing subject matter.

I think the novel would have made more of an impact if the author had chosen to be more focused. As it was I didn't find much of the novel very convincing. I was interested in most of the characters at the beginning, but there was a definite lack of character development throughout, despite all that happened, that made it difficult to truly believe in them. The epilogue in particular was very strange. Also this included a few really awkward sex scenes. This is a problem I seem to have had with many books I've read this year (really, why does this keep happening?!), so maybe I'm just less patient than I used to be with badly written descriptions of sex, but come on that scene (view spoiler) [under the Northern Lights (hide spoiler) ] was ridiculous. ...more Chris Bohjalian is becomming one of my new favorite authors.

Before long, they meet up with Uri Singer, a Jewish escapee from an Auschwitz-bound train, who becomes the group's protector. In a parallel story line, hundreds of Jewish women shuffle west on a gruesome death march from a concentration camp. Bohjalian presents the difficulties confronting both sets of travelers with carefully researched detail and an unflinching eye, but he blinks when creating the Emmerichs, painting them as untainted by either their privileged status, their indoctrination by the Nazi Party or their adoration of Hitler. Although most of the characters lack complexity, Bohjalian's well-chosen descriptions capture the anguish of a tragic era and the dehumanizing desolation wrought by war.

The first half was simply gruesome and appalling. It was like the author googled WWII horrors and squished every single one of them into the first half. There was nothing to temper that. It was a severe onslaught of horror. I couldn't even muster any feeling either, except for the over use of the eye-rolling muscles. Half way through, I did contemplate walking away. I put it down and read something else. But when that ended, I figured I could rally to the finish line. When I came back to it, it was less of a tragedy parade and the actual story had some room to unfold. There was also opportunity to get to know the characters. But it was too little too late. The ending of the book matched the thoughts expressed for the first half and my overall general feeling for this book. ...more Skeletons at the Feast explored an area of Nazi Germany few books I\u2019ve read have explored \u2014 the people living in Germany, or those who considered themselves Germans, who were not intimately involved in the Nazi\u2019s crimes against humanity. \u201cWhen this war was over, he and his family \u2014 all Germans \u2014 were going to have to live with the black mark of this (whatever this was) for a long, long time.\u201d {pg. 192} Anna, Mutti, and Theo are well-to-do Prussian beet farmers \u2014 who have always considered themsel Skeletons at the Feast explored an area of Nazi Germany few books I\u2019ve read have explored \u2014 the people living in Germany, or those who considered themselves Germans, who were not intimately involved in the Nazi\u2019s crimes against humanity. \u201cWhen this war was over, he and his family \u2014 all Germans \u2014 were going to have to live with the black mark of this (whatever this was) for a long, long time.\u201d {pg. 192} Anna, Mutti, and Theo are well-to-do Prussian beet farmers \u2014 who have always considered themselves German, and celebrated the return of their estate in Poland to Germany \u2014 fleeing the onslaught of Russian soldiers as World War II comes to a close. None of them had anything to do with the Holocaust, although Anna\u2019s twin, Helmut, and older brother, Werner, all serve in Germany\u2019s army. In fact, Anna, much to the amusement of Callum, had no idea what the Nazis were really doing to the Jews when they \u201crelocated\u201d them. \u201cThe Jews were being herded into the first three cars \u2014 far too many for each one, it was clear; dozens and dozens were going to be forced to stand \u2014 and their luggage was being loaded onto the fourth car. A freight car. And then, as Uri watched, that fourth car was uncoupled, and the fist three pulled away. The luggage, he saw, wasn\u2019t going with them. Luggage, he realized, never went with them.\u201d {pg. 16} In their trip across Poland and Germany to the western side and, therefore, the safety of the Brits and Americans, the family is accompanied by Callum \u2014 a Scottish POW who falls in love with Anna and a character so stilted, it\u2019s unbearable \u2014 and, occasionally, Uri \u2014 a Jew who escaped a train bound for Auschwitz and posses as a German military officer to escape capture by the very people he pretends to be. Uri is a interesting character, but I had a hard time believing he could have gotten away with possing as a German officer and, later, Russian for so long. \u201cBut there was still a part of him that craved the specifics: where and when and who was responsible. Who held the angry, barking dogs on their leashes? Who raised high the truncheons, who march them into the pits? Who fired the machine guns? Or, perhaps, switched on the gas? These were Germans and Poles and Ukrainians with faces and names, men adn women who before the war had had families and ran streetcares and bars and butcher shops \u2014 people he and his sister and his parents migh have seen on any sidewalk and hardly given a second look.\u201d {pg. 330} The other character, who in the beginning doesn\u2019t seem to make sense, is Cecile \u2014 a Jewish woman being marched from a concentration camp on the east side of German to the heart of the Third Reich. Cecile\u2019s account is heartwrenching, but very little attention is given to her throughout the book. \u201cHours later they heard explosions that were louder than the distant rumbling they\u2019d bee aware of for days, and Cecile told everyone that she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if their rckety wooden barracks now were gone, if the piles of smoldering ashes \u2014 as well as the blackened but not obliterated bones that lay among the cinders at the perimeter of the camp \u2014 were buried beneath the churned-up dirt from the center commons. The idea gave her pause, and she wasn\u2019t precisely sure how she felt about this: Though she didn\u2019t want such unmbiguous testiony to cruelty and babarism to remain on the planet, she wondered if people would ever believe what she\u2019d seen if there wasn\u2019t concrete proof.\u201d {pg. 104} One of the things I disliked about Skeletons at the Feast was the placement of the prologue. The prologue actually occurs in the middle portion of the book and would have just been better served if it was correctly placed chronologically. Putting it at the beginning as a prologue gave the story absolutely nothing, and frustrated me when the story jumped backwards a few years with the first chapter. On that note, my greatest frustration stemmed from the abundance of holes in this novel; it could have used at least 100 more pages of narrative to cover the big chunks of time that went missing with each chapter. I find it incredibly frustrating to read a good book, and then read the last couple and pages and suddenly weeks and months worth of time are passed over in an effort to keep the book at a certain length. ...more I'm a big fan of Chris Bohjalian.

I really enjoyed the story - I felt it was well-rounded and interesting. The characters were well done - drawn out throughout the story and each had compelling stories. I also enjoyed how well Bohjalian weaved in history and the personal stories of the characters. It gave the history a great deal of context and made it come alive for me. Bohjalian is a good writer and I enjoy his writing style and that held with this novel. It is a fairly dark book, given its subject matter. He describes the brutality of war in extremely keen detail. There are no horrid details spared, in many cases. I think this gave the novel texture but I can see how some might be put off by it. My only complaint about the book is that it had SO many things going on all at once - a romance, a war story, a coming of age story, a Jewish resistance story, etc. Lots going on in this book. So, at times it felt like it was a bit too much at once. Ultimately, I enjoyed the reading of the book and would recommend it. I think it could have been an excellent novel if it had a bit more focus. In the end, it's a good, solid novel with a few flaws. ...more I learned that Chris Bohjalian does not need to stick to just Vermont books. I have to say that I was a little nervous. I love Chris Bohjalian because he writes about Vermont. He understands Vermonters.

It captures what it is like to be from small town Vermont. That being said I was a little apprehensive about reading a book that was not set in Vermont. I am a history teacher and writing a book about the Holocaust can be daunting. It is hard to capture what the War was about and what the Holocaust was like without the book being overwhelmingly gory and graphic and still keeping the readers attention. Bohjalian captures the live, love, fear, and hate that all tie together the people of the Holocaust. When this book was over I felt alive, love, fear, and anger. The anger was at the book ending and that it was over. Of course there were some things I would change and other things I wished had been covered, but that is with every book and every movie. There is no media that has every met my liking in every single aspect. Call me a tough critic if you want but it is true. That being said, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to find hope in something evil... As you can see I am not a writer. However, I am an avid reader and I would place this book in my top ten. ...more \"Skeletons at the Feast\" was my third novel by Chris Bohjalian, and it brought me back to what I had loved about the first book of his that I had read ( Midwives ).
