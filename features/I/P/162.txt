Moning has created a fascinating new world for her characters to play in. Unfortunately it's those characters that really brought down this novel for me. MacKayla Lane's life is turned upside down the day she finds out that her sister Alina, who had been studying abroad in Ireland, has been murdered. The police have no leads and her case gets filed away as unsolved. MacKayla can't stomach the thought of her sister's killer getting away so she promptly quits her job, empties her bank account, and flies to Ireland to try to solve the mystery herself. MacKayla Lane is a vapid, shallow, stupid girl. She leaves her grieving parents behind to try to find out what happened to her sister. She thinks she can do better than the police yet her main thought throughout the novel is what color nail polish she should wear. On top of the nail polish, Mac constantly worries about her appearance; her clothes, hair, and make-up are the only thing she seems to care about. (view spoiler) [Her cover gets blown by a Fae and she bitches and moans about having to cut and dye her hair. Your sister DIED and you are worried about your stupid hair? (hide spoiler) ] She says that just because she likes pink and has blond hair it doesn't mean she's Barbie, but she never really seems to act anything but dumb and naive. She antagonizes the one person that is willing to help her, Jericho Barrons, and continuously hides information from him, thinking she knows best. Her actions around him are ridiculous, and at one point when he brings up her dead sister she yells, \" ShutupIhateyou! \", and yes, it's printed like that in the book. (view spoiler) [She acts like a petulant teen mad at her parents for grounding her, which in fact Barrons does, and she allows it. That doesn't stop her from leaving when he's gone and going off on her own though, getting into trouble. (hide spoiler) ] Not much better than Mac, Jericho Barrons is a reprehensible character. (view spoiler) [She lets him into her hotel room yet leaves her door open so she has a chance to yell if he tries anything funny. On his way out he crushes MacKayla to himself to show that the open door wouldn't save her and she comes away bruised, unable to wear a bra because the underwire hurts too much. At another point he kicks a coffee table and grabs and pulls her up by her hair, yelling at her for being stupid and going off on her own. And so, she enters into an abusive relationship with this man to the point where she thinks she has to rely on him in order to live. And she unfortunately has to because he's brought her farther into the world to the point of no-return. He uses her for his own purposes, which she is aware of, and yet by the end she looks at him as a savior, someone protecting her and helping her with finding and meting out justice to the one that killed her sister. (hide spoiler) ] Unfortunately on top of the abuse, Barrons has practically no personality. I couldn't get a feel for him as a person and I was only left with a deep dislike of him and his actions. There's nothing good about him to latch onto, aside from the fact that he's supposed to be the ubiquitous \"tall, dark, and handsome.\" I'm dreading reading about him as a love interest because I'm not sure if I can distance this Barrons from any future incarnation I come across. If I had been her I'd probably have thrown in with the Seelie prince that she encounters , at least he displayed some not entirely self-serving motives. These two characters are really an unfortunate creation in a very unique and interesting world. The only reason I could keep reading was because of the world-building. The Fae are scary and disgusting and I really got a feel for the streets of Dublin that Mac walked up and down, surprisingly not getting killed. I like Moning's ideas and the lore she weaves into the story. The style that Moning wrote in really pissed me off though. She's telling the story through Mac's eyes, as though it's already happened. So there's parts where Mac will say (I'm paraphrasing), \"I would later find out that he was lying but at this point I believed him,\" or \"this was where my life really changed\" - she does this throughout the whole book. So we can't even read the book and read the events as the story unfolds, future Mac has to go around spoiling things! I can understand using this in a prologue to set things up but I don't want to know things that the character doesn't even know yet! And the ending was dumb. (view spoiler) [Mac goes from a cut-off shorts, pink camisole, and strappy sandal wearing 22 year old tan blond bimbo to a fighting machine. With no training! Even Buffy had training. (hide spoiler) ] I already own the second book so I'll continue with this series against my better judgment. Update: I've also read Bloodfever now, so here's my review . ...more *SPOILER FREE FOR ALL YOU FEVER NOOBS* \u2026all two of you\u2026 It\u2019s no secret that Fever is my favorite series of all time. This is my third re-read of it and the entire reason I first decided to give these books another go was to force myself to attempt to properly review them and not just drool over Jericho Barrons for five pages. Mmmmm, Jericho, om nom nom nom nom nom. Damn it, there I go again. Anywho, there are a lot of reasons that I love this series aside from the male lead. I\u2019m going to go with a *SPOILER FREE FOR ALL YOU FEVER NOOBS* \u2026all two of you\u2026 It\u2019s no secret that Fever is my favorite series of all time. This is my third re-read of it and the entire reason I first decided to give these books another go was to force myself to attempt to properly review them and not just drool over Jericho Barrons for five pages. Mmmmm, Jericho, om nom nom nom nom nom. Damn it, there I go again. Anywho, there are a lot of reasons that I love this series aside from the male lead. I\u2019m going to go with a numbered list here as it seems to be the only way to make sense of all my feels . 1. The way in which the story is told Our narrator and MC, MacKayla Lane, has been through hell. You know this from page one, line one, where she says: \u201cMy philosophy is pretty simple \u2013 any day nobody\u2019s trying to kill me is a good day in my book. I haven\u2019t had many good days lately\u201d This series is told in retrospect and because of this we, the readers, get all sorts of ominous warnings throughout it along the lines of \u201cIf I had only known\u201d, \u201cOne day those words would come back to haunt me\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019d never let me forget that fact\u201d and so on. While I loved this series the first time I read it, I didn\u2019t appreciate it as much as I should have. Only upon my first re-read did I really grasp the genius of KMM. I noticed so many minute details that hinted at things to come and all those warnings made complete sense because I now knew what she was referencing. Ms. Moning must have had the entire thing planned out in advance, how else can you explain all the hidden gems I\u2019ve stumbled across? Even now, on my FOURTH read of this series, I\u2019m still noticing things I didn\u2019t pick up on before. 2. MacKayla Lane. I love her. I was behind her from page one, line one. In fact, I\u2019ve never not loved her. This is because, on a lot of levels, I get her. Because I used to be her. When I was Mac's age, I too was a sunshine girl, a rainbow girl. I used to wear beautiful dresses to work, spent hours on my outward appearance, accessorized to the nines and always tried to be nice to people. I even had a propensity for the words \u201csir\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am\u201d. And I got all sorts of comments about that. My hair in that photo is actually a little darker than I normally kept it because after a while, you get sort of sick of hearing people compare you to Paris Hilton. Do I look anything like her? No. Did people still whisper that shit all the time? Yes. Why? Maybe because I was blonde and I liked colorful clothes. Maybe because they\u2019re assholes. I couldn\u2019t really tell you. What those people failed to realize was that I'd been taking martial arts since I was old enough to throw a punch, and that the pretty little matching purse I clutched in my perfectly manicured nails held a five inch blade that I could hit you in the chest with from twenty feet away. Even if you dodged and the blade somehow missed I could probably break five joints or bones in your body before you realized what had happened. *grins* I think what people fail to realize about Mac is that she\u2019s exactly the same way. Oh sure, she might talk about how much she likes to accessorize and has a propensity for the color pink but you have to look deeper than that. What\u2019s the first thing she thinks about after she emerges from the haze of grief caused by her sister\u2019s murder? Vengeance. Mac\u2019s makeup is her war-paint. Her clothes are her chainmail. \u201cI might be bruised and bewildered, but by God I looked good. Like a smile I didn\u2019t really feel, presenting a together appearance made me feel more together inside, and I badly needed bolstering today.\u201d 3. The world-building Perfection. On every level. There\u2019s not one point in this book that I felt like KMM was info dumping. In part that\u2019s because the reader is learning about the world as Mac is learning. Instead of filling page upon page of the potentially boring conversations between Mac and Barrons, KMM has Mac record the necessities in her journal. Brilliant! The fae lore, the sidhe-seers and even the OOPs are revealed piece by pertinent piece. You\u2019re given just enough to fully understand what\u2019s going on in each scene but are constantly waiting for more. 4. Dublin I\u2019ve never been. Before reading this series, I sort of wanted to go. There were definitely a lot of European cities higher up on my list of places I had to visit before I die. After reading Fever? MUST. GO. NOW. The city transcends a backdrop and becomes a character itself. The Temple Bar District, the fictional dead-zones, even the Garda station jumped off of the pages at me. I had a perfect image in my mind of each one and when I Googled most of them afterwards, I was shocked by just how similar the real images were to the ones I\u2019d imagined. I want to spend a week there and explore it all. I want to get lost in the south side amongst the liberals and the elite and then cross the river Liffey and mingle with the blue collar Catholic Irish. I want to drink Guinness and try to figure out just what the hell people are saying. I want to eat stew and listen to faery tales. 5. Jericho Mothafuckin Barrons A lot of people picture David Gandy for JZB. Fuck that shit. Yes, I said it. His eyes are too light. He\u2019s too frigging pretty. JZB is darker, more carnal, purely sexual and intensely masculine. Only one man comes to mind when I think of him: The best way I know to describe him to those who have yet to meet him is self-contained. Every move he makes has a purpose, every sentence he speaks is full of meaning. He is the bearer of hard truths. When Mac would rather hide in the comfort of a convenient lie, he grabs her by the throat and forces her to face reality. He\u2019s an unapologetic asshole. He\u2019s cutthroat, mercenary, dangerous. I blame evolution for my attraction to him. Some lesser evolved part of my brain reads about Jericho Barrons and thinks \u201cThat man could not only defend your young but would happily slaughter anyone that even thought of threatening you.\u201d He makes my cavewoman stand up and take notice. In closing, I doubt I can ever really explain just why this series is my favorite but I hope the above has begun to do it some sort of justice.

And it would be a flip out if Barrons was her father! That would just be creepy as. It isn't that hard to figure it out. Am I right? You know I'm right. Me: Yes, darling, you're totally, totally right. *The End* My overall review of this series is that I really, really enjoy it. This series is addictive like crack. Most certainly, it isn't a perfect set of novels. In fact, there are many aspects of it that would annoy me in other novels such as the sexualization of violence against Mac and the romanticizing of an overtly aggressive alpha male. But my hormones demanded that I put these criticisms aside because... manflesh! Pretty, pretty manflesh! Yes, I too can be reduced to a quivering mass of lust induced hysteria. The world building is great, the characterization is pretty good, the story line is interesting and involving. All up, I recommend this series if you're looking for an Urban Fantasy to sink your teeth into. ...more Totally addicting, could not put it down! Buddy read with a TON of friends.

The point is, it's ugly, it is horrifying, it is disgusting, but you just can't bring yourself to look away. I give this book too little credit, I feel, in my rant over my hatred of Jericho and MacKayla. It truly is a well-written book. It is a testament to how good it is when the characters evoke such emotions within me, that I feel that they are realistic, complex, believable characters. The mythology is based upon the fae, the Tuatha de Danaan. It is beautifully written and a credit to the author that I loved it this much despite how much I disliked the main characters. Praises over, it's time for me to go off on how much I HATE JERICHO AND MAC. I hated MacKayla's immaturity and prissiness, improbable action and TSTL behavior. I don't care if you're a Southern Miss. You are a grown-ass woman. You can fucking curse when you want to. I was raised to be a lady by my mother, too, my very proper Asian mother who is as stringent (and astringent) on proper behavior as much as a Southern mom. I would die before I use bad language before my mother. Behind her back, I curse like a fucking sailor. I use language that would make the most hardened soul blush. Stupid little Mac with her \"petunias\" and her \"fudge-buckets\" and her multitude of platitudes for curses. Fuck you. You're an adult. Act like it. \"Because I was blonde, easy on the eyes, and guys had been snapping my bra strap since seventh grade, I'd been putting up with the Barbie stereotype for years.\" Guess what, honey? That's actually an accurate stereotype and a stupid statement to make because throughout the book, you act exactly like a brainless Barbie the majority of the time. I admire her initiative, she's out to solve her sister's murder. I get that, I sympathize, I absolutely do. I have a sister of my own, a little sister; I would jump through hellfire for her. I understand Mac's anger, her need for closure, and to an extent, her grief. \"Oh, go ahead,\" I hissed. \"Just kill me and get it over with. Put me out of my misery!\" Missing Alina was worse than a terminal illness. At least when you were terminal you knew the pain was going to end eventually. But there was no light at the end of my tunnel. Grief was going to devour me, day into night, night into day, and although I might feel like I was dying from it, might even wish I was, I never would. You can bet your petunia ass that I would damn well investigate my sister's mysterious death, if she were to die. \"I might not be the brightest bulb in the box, but I wasn't the dimmest, either.\" You sure about that, Mac? \"He didn't just occupy space; he saturated it. About thirty, six foot two or three, he had dark hair, golden skin, and dark eyes. His features were strong, chiseled. He wasn't handsome. That was too calm a word. He was intensely masculine. He was sexual. He attracted. There was an omnipresent carnality about him, in his dark eyes, in his full mouth, in the way he stood.\" Ok, Jericho is supposed to be hot? You know who else is considered hot? Serial killers like Richard Ramirez and Jeffrey Dahmer. And as for stalkery behavior, he's got Edward Cullen beat. And Mr. Sparkles is less of an asshat. \"I am unaccustomed to asking for what I want. Nor am I accustomed to bartering with a woman,\" he said finally. I know there's a lot of people out there who find Jericho attractive; I can't comprehend it. He is larger-than-life, true, he has a magnetic presence, true. But I am the type who likes a gentleman, a gentle man, Jericho is not. There is rarely a moment of softness with him. He is the alpha male of alpha males. You know those monsters that jump out of a haunted house and goes BOO? That's Jericho. He constantly jumps close to Mac and scares the shit out of her. It gets old. Condescension, intimidation, and fear are tactics of interrogation, not seduction . I do not find him remotely romantic, it does not get my panties wet. Nope nope nope. Characters aside, this was a very well-written book. The description of the dark, damp, dreary environment of Ireland I did love the incorporation of Celtic myth, of the portrayal of the fae. They are not fairies, as initially believed by Mac. They are horrendous, rotting, foul creatures. Outwardly beautiful, like the spectacular Legolas V'lane, they are inwardly manipulative, and disgustingly sexually abusive. They literally suck the life out of a person, stealing their outward beauty and inner spirit. I loved the portrayal of the dark side, the horrifying side, of the world of fae. It is a complete 180 from the wonderfully bright and beautiful world of fairies about which I have read in the past. Reluctantly recommended by me. ...more Rating is for the entire Fever series. Fast-paced and action packed, I plowed through all five books in a week. Having now finished this book that came so highly recommended, I have to admit that what I feel mostly is indifference. I wanted to love it, but I didn't. That being said, I didn't dislike it either. The problem was that I just didn't care a whole lot one way or the other.

The story is about a young woman, MacKayla, that goes to Ireland to play detective after the death of her sister. In no time, she's uncovered a whole new reality, full of supernatural beings that she had only thought existed in fairytales. The more clues she unearths, the more she begins to wonder if she's following in her sister's footsteps. Along the way, she partners up with Jericho, who is looking for the same ancient book that MacKayla is. The sexual tension is off the charts between these two. However, MacKayla doesn't know if she can really trust him or not. There is a fair amount of action/adventure in this book and it is relatively suspenseful. I would have liked more romance, but it just wasn't that type of book. It is the first book in a series, so that may change as the series progresses. Although the story was just kind of \"okay\" for me, I did think that the narration was done well. So often when I listen to audiobooks, the narrators butcher a southern accent. Often times, it ruins the entire story for me as I want to cringe and cover my ears. Finally, somebody got it right! Overall, I give it 3-stars. I would have given the narration 4 or 5-stars though. It was a nice story to pass some time, but I didn't love it like most of my friends did. ...more Updated 12/8/2014 Yep, still addictive.

However the main purpose of this update is just to follow up on the outcome of this particular series. So many crash and burn in the process, lose their steam and become a waste of time. Not so here. Fever books are fantastic from the 1st to the last. This series is a great adventure full of mystery, action, intrigue, intricate fae mythology, sexy guys, and hawt schmexing. I am now going to add an extra star to all my Fever reviews for meeting my expectations and not disappointing me in the end. Original review I am no expert on urban fantasy and will not waste any time on analyzing the quality of writing of this genre book, I am just going to say that <+++>Darkfever</+++> 's standard mix of ass-kicking heroine/amusing cast of secondary characters/lore/mystery/paranormal hunks worked for me. MacKayla Lane is a 22-year old blonde southern belle/bartender/part-time student who peacefully lives with her parents in a small Georgia town. Mac's life is turned upside down when she learns her older sister Alina is brutally murdered in Dublin, Ireland. The search for the murderer is fruitless and after uncovering Alina's last cryptic voice message, Mac decides to go to Ireland and try to push the murder investigation in the right direction. In Dublin MacKayla immediately finds herself thrown into a world of Faery and learns she has a powerful connection to this world... The first thing that drew me to this book was the narrator - MacKayla. My last couple of attempts to explore the genre of urban fantasy were unsuccessful mainly because I couldn't stomach the protagonists. After enduring wimpy and boring Mercy Thompson ( Moon Called ) and perpetually gloomy and defiant Kate Daniels ( Magic Bites ), reading MacKayla's \"voice\" was a relief. She is not particularly smart or strong, but there is a certain lightness about her, and the fact that Mac is not traumatized by some past events is a breath of fresh air too. So many UF heroines, almost as a rule, are some kind of recovering victims. Luckily, Mac isn't one of them. The lore and the setting are enjoyable too. <---A>Karen Marie Moning</---A> builds her fairy world on Irish lore and I think succeeds in it. Her fae are interesting, with their various abilities to feed on humans' beauty, to make their unwitting victims sexually aroused, etc. What might turn off some readers: 1) This book doesn't have a conclusive ending. <+++>Darkfever</+++> is simply a first chapter in Moning's 5-part story whose major conflict will be resolved in the last book - Shadowfever - out December 2010. Only a few story threads are wrapped up in this installment. 2) Lack of romance. It doesn't mean there are no hotties to swoon over however (mysterious Jericho Barrons and ruthless Fae prince Vlane are both irresistibly alluring), but at this point Mac is with neither of these guys. Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It was fast-paced, filled with entertaining characters and interesting lore. I will definitely read at least the next book in the series - Bloodfever . ...more What a great story! And it would have been even greater, if it weren't for Ms. Mackayla-call her Mac-Lane.

Put your priorities in order: a) Pink nail-polish, hormones, fate of the world. b) Hormones, fate of the world, pink nail-polish. c) Fate of the world, hormones, pink nail-what? Yeap, you guessed right. Dearest Mac's answers were solid A's. If you like your heroines Barbie -like, you're going to love her. She had her moments of course, but she was shallow, impulsive and self-centered to the core. I can understand her reservations to believe in the extraordinary, her reluctance to accept her destiny and her need for closure after her sister's murder, but that's it. I can't justify every single stupid decision she made (and trust me, they were many), and her fixation on her appearance when everything was falling apart, but hey! if you are killed in your sleep you should at least be fashionable, right? I think, though, that I started off the wrong way. Because Darkfever was actually a deeply addictive, action-packed and ingenious story ! As you can already tell, it follows the adventures of Mac, whose sister was brutally murdered in Ireland and so she decided to travel there and find the answers she was denied. But there is something ominous in the streets of Dublin, and she soon encounters creatures that came straight out of nightmares, she searches for objects of dark magic and gets in the middle of the ancient war between Men and Fae, a war that is about to be rekindled. She doesn't know who to trust. The most obvious choice is the sensual stranger who has saved her life a couple of times, but has many secrets and seems to use her for his own purposes. There is only one thing she knows for sure: the Mackayla Lane who first arrived in Ireland is not the same Mackayla Lane that will leave. If she leaves at all. \u201cThere are two kinds of people in this world, Ms. Lane: those who survive no matter the cost, and those who are walking lambs.\u201d Fast-paced. Eerie. Other-worldly. And a little on the sexy side. That is Karen Marie Moning 's Darkfever, and it deserves all the hype around it. Setting aside my huge dislike of Mac, I loved this wonderful and intricate world, with its rich mythology , its gothic vibe and its strong mystery element. The narration, with its ominous warnings, the foreshadowing and the way Mac talked to the reader made me even more curious about the events to come. Fae have always been fascinating, and this sinister version of them made Darkfever repulsing and seductive at the same time. And there was also Jericho Barrons . This man is clouded in mystery, he oozes sexuality, and he's not scared of letting Mac know what he thinks about her. The tension between them is so thick you can cut it with a knife, and I am certain explosions and earthquakes will take place in the next books. Well, count me in! \u201cIt's what you choose to believe that makes you the person you are.\u201d All in all, Darkfever is a page-turner , and I'm looking forward to returning to Dublin's dark streets! ...more 1.5 stars This is one of those books where almost every aspect of the book failed me. The characters were flat, the plot stalled around 40%, and the narration was unsatisfying. In fact, the only reason why I didn't just give the book one star was because the beginning intrigued me. Barrons. I don't get his appeal. This is partly because I don't particularly care for the whole \"alpha male\" trope since many times all it seems to be is barely disguised sexual or physical abuse against the heroine. 1.5 stars This is one of those books where almost every aspect of the book failed me.

Barrons. I don't get his appeal. This is partly because I don't particularly care for the whole \"alpha male\" trope since many times all it seems to be is barely disguised sexual or physical abuse against the heroine. Oh, so Barrons likes to threaten Mac or give her a good choke to get his point across? Totally cool, he's just being an Alpha Male! Catch Me! Swoon! I think not. Had this have been a YA novel, we'd all be calling this an abusive relationship. He may show a different side to himself later in the series, but I don't think I'll be able to look past book 1 to ever find him remotely attractive. Mac is probably the most annoying heroine I've read in a long time. (Maybe if I had read this circa 2009, I would have liked it better.) She's a very shallow person, who I had a really hard time relating to, understanding, or caring about. Her sister is dead and she's supposedly trying to find the murderer, but she always seemed more concerned with what color her nails were. Why is this important? The narration wasn't my favorite with Mac constantly interjecting with lines like \"I won't bore you with the details...\" IT WAS SO ANNOYING. I just wanted to shake her. Like, PLESAE bore me with the details because this is a, you know, BOOK. But no. Instead Moning decided that telling me every detail of Mac's outfit was somehow more relevant that describing what the fey looked like. Having Mac constantly spoil the plot time after time got so old and left no room for the element of surprise. By the time I finished the book, I feel like I know about as much about the characters and the world from when I started, which is nothing at all. Well, wait. This is what I know. As Mac would say, \"I'm just paraphrasing here.\" - Mac likes the color pink, is fashion forward and apparently spends way too much money in the iTunes store - Barrons likes to beat his fists against his chest. He does macho things in his spare time, like running a book store. Since Mac barely describes him, this is what my brain registered him as: - the fey are evil and like to rape women because reasons - Mac's sister died by some evil guy who is not fey but also not human?? Also, his name is Lord Master (over compensating much?). I'm unsure if that's his BDSM alias or real name. Anyway, Mac's sister was hiding stuff from Mac because plot. - Mac's parents are hiding things because plot - Evil fey hang out in the part of town no one goes to because it's abandoned. Ummm, duh? Also, plot. Pretty big disappointment with this one, folks. ...more Darkfever took me on a very dark ride, but I enjoyed myself immensely. Ms. Moning delivers with her concept of the Fae, and with this story of the inception of a young woman's crusade to find out who murdered her sister and why.

Along with Mac, I was thrown to the wolves, exposed to the cruel, ruthless, and extremely scary nature of the Fae. I am very interested in stories that show Faeries not as the cute, glittery sprites that dance around flowers and giggle in high-pitched voices, but the otherworldly type, who view humans as objects to be used and discarded, when they aren't ignored as beneath their notice. Call me weird, I guess. If I am, then Ms. Moning and I am on the same wavelength here. Mac was a very interesting character. She seemed shallow and immature, but she wasn't. I saw her evolve very quickly as a person, and show that underneath the pink nails, perfect blonde hair, and always coordinated fashions, there was a strong woman who could hold her own. I am very close to my sister, and this book hit home with me. I can't imagine how Mac would have felt, and I don't want to. Having your sister be alive and then the next, horribly murdered. That is an awful place to be in. And to find out about your hidden heritage as a sidhe-seer, and that the Fae are ruthless, cruel and dangerous beings, and you might be one of the few who can stand against them if they decide to take over the world. Wow! Just wow! I'd say she stood up great under all that pressure. And Barrons. I had heard about the guy. He was even better than I expected. Erudite, cultured, dangerously intelligent, powerful, good-looking, and with a hidden agenda and nature that kept me intrigued. He's manipulative and cuttingly sarcastic, but he saves Mac's life and gives her shelter, and even better, helps her to find the means to survive in a world that doesn't make a bit of sense, and to come into her destiny as a power sidhe-seer. Oh, and he owns a bookstore, a really nice one. That's another plus. I was thinking he was like Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with a little bad boy thrown in for flavor. But my mother nailed it, as she often does! He's actually like Wesley, well Bad Wesley (after he betrays Angel and gets his throat cut). She is so right, and I loved the comparison, since I adore Wesley (good/nerdy and Bad/dangerous Wesley both). Anyway, Barrons....Loved him! I thought that there was a great dynamic between Barrons and Mac, sort of a sensei/student, sidekick, antagonistic partner/frenemies, and could be something more (with the tons of sexual chemistry between them). I've been a fan of Ms. Moning for years, since I've read most of her Highlander books, but I have to say that this book really cements my admiration for her. She writes the Fae very, very well (beautiful/ugly, otherworldly, and very dangerous), and she managed to write a story that engaged me on many levels. There were the dark elements, the humor, the appeal of an ancient, foreign city that was so exquisitely described in the narrative, a likeable heroine who had depths, and I was able to see evolve in a good way over the course of the book, a fantastic antihero, bad boy like Barrons calling my name, and very scary, intense adversaries. This book was primo. I have definitely gotten the Fever, and I want more! ...more My apologies to Olivia, I know you weren't blown away by Action Barbie and her gang of new friends, but OMG I loved this.

I was constantly grumpy for the past few days, without having a real reason. Conversations with me pretty much went like this: Person: Kim? Me: WHAT? So after having to reanimate a few of those persons I put 2 and 2 together and realized it was because I felt anxious every moment I wasn't reading this book. There was not one dull chapter in this book, I kept wanting to find out what would happen next. I love how certain questions were left unanswered, questions that a lot of other series already elaborately explain in the first book. I'm not very girly myself so I don't really get the whole pink thing, but it didn't bother me. (I was lucky enough to keep Alicia Silverstone out of my head during the entire book!) I heard a some things about Mac before I read this and I was expecting I would hate her guts. But nope. Love her. I even felt bad because I laughed during her encounters with V'lane. The first one was just funny, the second one was... um... I'm trying to find a way to describe this without giving anything away... I don't know... I read that part and tried to imagine myself in Mac's position . I'm sure my low levels of feeling horrified don't even come close to what it must be like. I pretty much went into high school crush mode the moment I met Barrons (but I didn't know why yet, and I'm still not sure if I have a reason). I'm so intrigued, I feel like bursting out of my skin. I'm this close to booking a flight to Ireland. I'll even swim if I have to. I would dive into the second book this instant if I wasn't reading 3 other books already, but if I don't force myself to read those first, I'll spend all my time reading this series. And maybe it's not a bad idea to drag this out a bit. I might have to give my Kindle to somebody so I can't start reading Bloodfever . But I don't want to end up in jail for assault and battery, or even manslaughter, 'cause I'll know I'll say \"don't let me have my Kindle under any circumstances\" and then regret it 3 seconds later. *dreamy sigh* Oh Barrons. Where have you been all my life? ...more I went into this book expecting to possibly die of swoons, sexy times and badass battle scenes, but right now I kind of just want to push every character in this book off a cliff .

Okay, I'm kidding. They totally are. At least, they are in my book. Ladies and gents, I present to you, MacKayla Lane: No, I'm serious . I am fucking baffled as to why she keeps claiming not to be a Barbie (meaning your typical blond and very pink idiot) when she honestly is one . This woman is a complete asshole who lacks any sort of common sense. I mean, she basically walks towards danger. Who does that? She's also incredibly vain, shallow and ignorant, never forgetting to mention how pretty she is and how she can \"never pull off ugly.\" Then we have Jerricho Barons. He's basically Christian Grey... minus the excessive love for BDSM . This douchebag is manipulative, abusive, and also has the same personality as a cardboard box . Okay, I lied. A cardboard box would have much more personality than him. On the other side of the spectrum, we have V'lane, a Fae who basically kills people by making them want sex so bad it makes them go crazy. (Yes, even Mac. Surprise, surprise!) So, he's also abusive and talks like he owns the Earth and everyone in it . Not attractive. At all. Also, every single guy Mac meets in this book is apparently hot/sexy/attractive/buff/cute/dresses nicely. Where are the regular people? Where are the unattractive ones? WHAT UNIVERSE DOES MACKAYLA LANE LIVE IN?! Another little qualm of mine: How the heck is this book listed as a romance novel? Where is the actual romance?! Someone please shove it in my face because I really, really can't see it . We only see hints of a blossoming \"attraction\" and basically no other swoony feelings whatsoever. I can't even say that Mac and Barrons are friends , let alone anything more. Rage-inducing things aside, this book definitely had a lot of potential. Moning definitely didn't shy away from writing graphic descriptions (and we all know I'm a huge fan of that) and creating such odd creatures. My eyes widened every time Mac encountered a creepy new Fae. Oh but wait! I have another complaint! The ending managed to be predictable and random both at the same time. The actual \"bam\" moment turned out to be a \"meh\" one. As a bonus, we got Mac suddenly turning into a killing machine without any past training! Hooray. Because I'm a masochist I've been told that this series gets better, however, I'm still going to read the sequels. Eventually.

So. Darkfever. I was pretty much hooked after reading the prologue as I fell in love with Mac's narrative voice right away (not with Mac herself, but more on that later). Kudos to Moning here because very little authors manage to draw me into a story from the very first pages (what can I say, I'm easily bored and have little patience). The problem is, the pace slowed down a lot after the prologue. The slow pace is a recurring problem with first instalments in series since the author needs to start building up the world and to set things in motion. I was surprised here because the prologue threw me into the story but it then felt like I was torn away from it somehow. Moning gives us a glimpse of what is to come and then takes it all away. I know the first part of the book is necessary but to be honest I would have been happy to jump straight through to Mac's arrival in Ireland. Although it does takes Moning time to set things up, her world-building is pretty fantastic. I'm pretty new to UF so this is actually the first time I read a story that revolves around the Fae. They're evil and malevolent too, yay! How cool is that? And I have to say that the whole death-by-sex Fae idea is absolutely brilliant. My twisted little mind just loves the idea of dark, mean, vicious, hideous fairies that only have the destruction of mankind in mind! How fun! Tinkerbell be gone! Now for the characters. Mac. Oh Mac. As I said before, I absolutely *loved* Mac's narrative voice in the prologue. She came across as a real badass. The problem is, her character is nothing like that. Not in this instalment anyway. Granted, she gets a little better towards the end but she still has a long way to go. Instead of kicking ass Mac is all about being a Barbie airhead who is obsessed with pink and silly outfits. I understand what Moning tried to do here but I think she just went too far and laid it on much too thick. No wonder Barrons thinks she's a superficial idiot, she acts like one. My freaky reading buddies keep telling me she gets better so I'll just have to trust them on that (or not. You never know with this crazy bunch). I think the real disappointment here was Barrons. Jericho Freaking Barrons. I've heard *so much* about you. You're supposed to be hot and sexy. Only you're not. You're just one of the most annoyingly aggravating MC ever and I feel like strangling you most of the time. God knows you have every reason to be exasperated by Mac but still. Do you have to be such an ass all the time? Again, my MacHalo girls tell me you get better in time but it seems I have to wait until the end of book 3 to see it happen\u2026 Book 3? Seriously?! I want hotness! I want sexy! Now! Hey, you know what? No need to wait for book 3 for that because we have V'Lane right here with us^^ He only appears in two scenes in Darkfever but wow, what scenes! I know it's all supposed to be pretty horrific but I thought it was very cool and pretty hilarious (some say I have a weird sense of humour. I wonder why). So right now I'm on Team V'Lane. I'm pretty sure it will all go downhill from here and I'll end up being on Team Barrons but I'm pretty happy with my Seelie Prince at the moment, thank you very much:) One more thing before I wrap this up: there is one scene in the book that is completely ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense. Barrons painting Mac's nails? You have to be kidding me. I don't think I have ever read anything that felt so out of character and so completely surreal. I just couldn't believe what I was reading. I'm pretty sure lots of readers find that scene irresistible and super cute but I just think it's plain silly. All in all and despite its flaws, Darkfever is a pretty awesome introduction to the world of Fever. It didn't blow my mind as much as I thought it would but it's still a pretty fantastic read. Besides, it's only the first instalment in the series so there is lots of room for development. Bloodfever here I come!

Seriously dudettes, if you\u2019ve never read Fever, then at least do it for the sake of Barrons. You\u2019ll thank me later. Speaking of self-induced-pleasure, oh how I love the spark between Mac and Barrons! I mean, just look at them drool over each other, exchange cute words and flirt non-stop. \"You, Ms. Lane, are a sidhe-seer.\" \"Huh?\" What was a she-seer? \"A sidhe-seer. You see the Fae.\" I burst out laughing. \"This is no laughing matter,\" he said roughly. \"This is about life and death, you imbecile.\" Barrons. Can\u2019t live with him, can\u2019t live without him. I kid the cute words and flirting. Don\u2019t expect much of it. Barrons is a cruel sonovabitch and it takes more than just a pair of fine boobies to catch his attention. Maybe this is one of the reasons why I love him so much. Yes, he\u2019s an asshole but he knows what he wants and stops at nothing to get it. Think of this as a wonderful prelude to one of the best couples in book history. The intensity of it makes me get all bubbly inside. Because I know how it ends. Do you know? No? Does it make you feel bad that I know? Yes? Read the books and you\u2019ll know. Anyway, reading Darkfever for a second time was very entertaining and refreshing. It\u2019s actually the first time I re-read a book. Isn\u2019t that exciting? It sure is. Nevertheless, the best part of re-reading a series is knowing how it ends. The author can\u2019t trick you anymore! I\u2019ve had so many moments where Karen Marie was throwing hints around, and I remember the first time I read the book I was worried and thinking about all the possibilities, building theories. And now. Now I KNOW EVERYTHING. It sure feels good. Darkfever is, in fact, the weakest of the Fever books, but it does have lots of memorable moments. It also taught me lots of useful things. Stay in the light. Don\u2019t stare at strangers. Fuck the police because they are useless. The group read deal came with five questions that all the participants have to answer. Here we go. My Mini-Interview for Darkfever: Question#1: How would you describe this book in 2 words? I\u2019m too good to settle for two words. Here\u2019s only ONE word: holyfreakingcheesecakeliciouslygood. Question#2: At what point did Barrons start wanting more from Mac than just her ability to sense things? Since this moment. \u201cI told you we were going to visit a vampire in a Goth-den tonight. Why, then, Ms. Lane, do you look like a perky rainbow?\" I shrugged in kind. \"Take me or leave me, Barrons.\" He took me. As I'd known he would. Question#3: Do you find V\u2019lane attractive? Explain your answer. Even though V\u2019lane is described as the most perfect creature that walks the earth I fail to be attracted to him. My reasons are simple. First of all, getting a helpless woman half naked in public without her consent is a no-go for me. Second, Mac was describing all these monsters who cloak their true faces under the illusion of beauty. This makes me think, what if there is a type of monster who is naturally gorgeous but just as dangerous as the rest of them? Yes. Yes, there is. V\u2019lane. My job here is done. Question#4: What's the first thought you had when you heard there'd be a Fever Reread? Barrons!!!!!! *dirty thoughts* It will be nice to read Mac\u2019s story again. Question#5: Which is your favorite scene from the book? The scene where Mac got lost in the dark streets, and suddenly she stumbled upon Barrons Books and Baubles that looked like an oasis flooded in light. I have a very good visual image of it in my mind. Maybe one day I\u2019ll paint it. And last but not least, my favorite quote : A butterfly flaps its wings somewhere and the wind changes, and a warm front hits a cold front off the coast of western Africa and before you know it you've got a hurricane closing in. By the time anyone figured out the storm was coming, it was too late to do anything but batten down the hatches and exercise damage control. Why? Because this is how it all started.

My reviews for the other Fever books: Bloodfever (Fever #2) Faefever (Fever #3) Dreamfever (Fever #4) Shadowfever (Fever #5) ...more Second book of 2016 DONE! Really enjoyed this one for what it is.... A fun sexy paranormal new adult book! It's short and gets to the point, it's exactly what I wanted and kept me reading into the weeeeeee hours of the night/morning. Good thing I have the next 4 books in the series, cause this one ended way too soon! This is a spoiler-free mini-review for the SERIES, not just this book: Do you want to meet THE. Ultimate. Alpha Male. Character?? Grab yourselves a copy of Darkfever and meet the enigmatic, mysterious, fiercely protective, powerful and dominating Jericho Z Barrons. \u201cHe didn't just occupy space; he saturated it.

Ultimate. Alpha Male. Character?? Grab yourselves a copy of Darkfever and meet the enigmatic, mysterious, fiercely protective, powerful and dominating Jericho Z Barrons. \u201cHe didn't just occupy space; he saturated it. The room had been full of books before, now it was full of him.\u201d All I can say is if you want a completed book series with an incredible plot, a unique world, and vivid, multi-layered characters with deep pasts, where EVERYTHING happens for a reason (having finished them, I realized there was absolutely NO fluff in these series at ALL), and a full-filling, heart-warming HEA, then this is the series for you. Moning does a masterful job of building an world full of multiple complex story lines and then weaves them all together seamlessly in a way that will keep you guessing right up till the very end. (ALL my predictions were wrong! and that doesn\u2019t happen very often)\u2026 This book will have you going crazy asking \u201cWhat IS Barrons????\u201d \u201cWhen you know who I am. Let me be your man.\u201d Seriously, this is one of the BEST paranormal series I have EVER read. I can\u2019t recommend them highly enough! It is a COMPLETED series and should be read in order. It is one continuous story. Each book starts right where the previous one left off. And the SERIES ending is a HEA. The individual books themselves have cliffhangers since the story spans 5 books. And they are definitely \u2018adult\u2019. \u201cOne day you will kiss a man you can\u2019t breathe without, and find that breath is of little consequence.\u201d And there are a few Barrons casting visuals here to help convince you to give this series a shot :) PS. I read these books in my pre-review writing days so I apologize for the lack of detail. ...more 4.5 Stunning Stars. I went into this one with a bit of trepidation. Why? Well, for one, it is Paranormal which I do not really do. Two, it is set in Ireland and, being Irish, I can be super critical if it is not done right. But a few friends decided it was time to go for it and do a Buddy Read of it. I loved it. OK, the terminology was a bit too much to take in at times but the writing was excellent.

I love books, by the way, way more than movies. Movies tell you what to think. A good book lets you choose a few thoughts for yourself. Movies show you the pink house. A good book tells you there's a pink house and lets you paint some of the finishing touches, maybe choose the roof style,park your own car out front. My imagination has always topped anything a movie could come up with. Case in point, those darned Harry Potter movies.

Don\u2019t really know Dublin that well as I am from the West of Ireland meself. But she knew her stuff. Only thing I found wrong was that she said Gardai car instead of Garda car \u2013 Gardai is plural. But that is just nit-picking from me. Barrons laughed again. \"And there, my dear Fio, you make one of Womankind's greatest mistakes: Falling in love with a man's potential. We so rarely share the same view of it, and even more rarely care to achieve it.

After riding out the horribleness which became the Southern Vampire series, I just wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with yet another vapid waitress and her otherwordly interactions. You see, Mac is a simple waitress from a simple small Southern town whose simple life gets flipped upside down when her sister gets murdered. Annnnnnnd of course Mac has to take it upon herself to travel halfway across the world in order to become an amateur Sherlock Holmes and find out \u201cwhodunit.\u201d The problem? Well, Mac is an idiot. I mean, she made Sookie seem like a real braintrust, which is simply terrifying. Mac spends most of her time coordinating her ensembles with her nails, and don\u2019t you know . . . Yep, Mac referenced pink so much I thought I was going to barf Pepto Bismol. Along the way, Mac meets a mysterious alpha male named Barrons who (like me) finds her insufferable, but (unlike me) somehow doesn\u2019t follow his instincts to step aside and let her be murdered. Turns out that\u2019s a good thing as Mac has some special powers of her own. Powers that detect the hidden Fae that walk amongst the normies as well as the ability to sense hidden Fae Objects of Power (OOPs for short). Sidenote : My brain insisted on replacing OOP with O.P.P. \u2013 which is a VERY different thing. That song is still playing in my head. Are any of you even old enough to remember Naughty by Nature? Probably not *insert sad face* so here\u2019s a little image that will show you how the song goes . . . Okay, back on topic. Barrons recruits Mac in order to find the Sinsar Dubh \u2013 the most powerful of all of OOPs that can destroy the world as we know it. Talk about some serious pressure. Get it? Anyone? Bueller? Under Pressure \u2013 Queen and David Bowie??? Hilarious! Alright, so this book didn\u2019t work for me and I didn\u2019t like it, but I didn\u2019t completely hate it either. Some things I enjoyed? 1. The writing wasn\u2019t horrible and although I really don\u2019t like first person narrative, I did like that Mac\u2019s voice was well aware of the fact that she was telling a story that already happened . Seriously authors, if you are writing from first person it\u2019s pretty obvious that person ISN\u2019T DEAD, so don\u2019t try to bullshit the reader into getting all nervous about whether they\u2019re going to make it out alive. 2. Mac admits she\u2019s a useless Barbie in times of crisis. 3. The setting. Although the world building was pretty lame for me, I\u2019m assuming it gets better since there are a crapton more books in this series. However . . . Dublin???? That\u2019s good \u2013 assuming Mac and Barrons ever leave the f-ing bookstore. 4. Mac\u2019s superpower of detecting bad guys? She vomits. LOLOLOLOL. I got a kick out of that. 5. And last, but obviously not least, BARRONS . Duh, right? I haven\u2019t yet read any reviews of this series, but I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a lot of Joe Manganiello gifs to be had. For me, though? It was all about this dude . . . and anytime I can\u2019t get the image of Oded Fehr out of my head is a good time. To all my homegirls out there who have read/are currently reading/or are re-reading this series \u2013 I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m always the oddball : ( ...more E.T.A.

Read on\u2026 ____________________________________________ MacKayla Lane. Ohhh, how you irk me. Your obsession with pink was the first thing to prejudice me against you. How much pink can a person own? Obsession with nail polish was next. I don\u2019t know how you found the time to redo your nails a gabillion times in your two weeks in Ireland, but manage it you did. Then I found out that you hate Ireland. I understand you had some terrible things happen in your time there and that would turn anyone against a place. But did you consider your own behaviour having an effect on your experience? You blustered around, getting in people\u2019s faces, and even tailing some poor defenseless woman on her walk home. Of course people aren\u2019t being friendly! No one is going to be friendly to an obnoxious, aggressive American with \u201cspoiled\u201d written across her forehead! And if you\u2019ve managed to make hordes of Irish people be rude to you, you know you\u2019re going about your business in a massively wrong way. Ireland IS tourism. It\u2019s inquisitive people. It\u2019s complete strangers who will chat your ear off given half a chance. Granted, it\u2019s a bit different in a major city like Dublin, but still\u2026 Can you tell I\u2019m attached to Ireland? Grrrr. Moving along, and no longer directing my complaints to MacKayla herself: The character lacks common sense. This is the one thing I cannot tolerate in my leads. I accept a certain degree of naivet\u00e9 based on background and a sheltered life, but that only goes so far. There are plenty of characters on the UF block (another barmaid comes to mind) who have never encountered something Other - and yet, they manage to slap on the wary and conduct themselves in a careful manner that encourages their survival (even while trying to deny the scary thing staring them in the face). Mac isn\u2019t careful. Hell, she runs headlong into an abandoned neighborhood in a foreign city and KEEPS GOING. If it looks dangerous, and smells dangerous, and FEELS dangerous\u2026don\u2019t be surprised when you\u2019re the victim of a grab and stab. All of this means I felt no connection to Mac. I couldn\u2019t relate to her on any level. (And that comment about certain nationalities being base and primitive? Ohhh, that stuck in my craw.) Nor did I develop an attachment to the enigmatic Barrons . Granted, he\u2019s physically attractive and probably has a fascinating backstory. However, he\u2019s so closed off and so adamantly out for Number One that I view him as a glorious lion - beautiful, powerful and dangerous and I will not be petting him anytime soon. I\u2019d like to keep my fingers - nay, my whole arm - intact, thank you. Mac does \u201cgrow\u201d over the course of the story, but it\u2019s forced. She has to change her appearance, but that\u2019s simply out of necessity, not choice. She doesn\u2019t actually accept the world she\u2019s thrust herself into , as shown by her refusal to heed the advice of people in the know. She doesn\u2019t use Barrons to full advantage. She doesn\u2019t press the old woman who keeps popping up. She seems content to learn things only as they come up. Again, I\u2019m trying to keep in mind we\u2019re dealing with a short time span and a na\u00efve girl, but I\u2019d personally want as much info as possible to better my chances of survival. Survival - that brings up another point: Mac is absolutely useless at fighting, the typical damsel-in-distress. Until the final chapters. Suddenly she\u2019s a machine , taking on several foes at once and adeptly holding her own. It\u2019s unrealistic. Perhaps if Moning had incorporated a scene wherein Barrons tutored her in self-defense, this abrupt change wouldn\u2019t be so startling. As it happened, I wondered what pod person had taken over the barmaid\u2019s body and replaced her with a ninja. Speaking of inexplicable changes, (view spoiler) [how in heaven\u2019s name does Barrons go from gruff and surly to Painting. Her. Nails? Yup, that\u2019s right. Mr. I\u2019m Going to Use and Abuse You is suddenly content to pick up a teensy brush and apply some pink lacquer to Miss Thing\u2019s fingers (hide spoiler) ] . There is no build-up to this bonding, doting moment. It just hangs there, unsupported in any way by the preceding text. If the author wants me to start seeing Barrons in a kinder, softer light, she needs to do so gradually . This merely struck me as completely out of character. I\u2019ve blathered on about the leads. I suppose I should comment on the plot itself. It\u2019s an interesting set-up for a world, a quest, the onset of a battle. But I can\u2019t say it\u2019s more than just set-up. The main focus is Mac\u2019s acclimation. Definitions of objects and beings are given, there\u2019s some thieving and killing, and there are some flimsy developments in the mystery of who killed Alina. But I\u2019m left feeling no real progress has been made . Instead it seems more like an unconnected stream of events. I\u2019m guessing this is due to Mac mostly blundering about rather than grabbing the reins of her own life\u2026but that will lead me back to character critique so I\u2019ll stop there. Various GR friends insist this series, and its heroine, improve over time. I dearly hope so. Otherwise, they\u2019re gonna have some \u2018splaining to do! ...more *5 stars*5 stars*5 stars*5 stars* I have always enjoyed reading UF series, especially the ones containing a bit of mystery.

I actually had to drag myself to bed and convince myself that tomorrow is another day, that I'll have plenty of time to read and that nothing's going to happen to my heroine that I wouldn't know eventually about. Of all the UFs I've read in my life, (Queen Betsy, Charley Davidson, Night Huntress, Parasol Protectorate,...) this one had, in my opinion, the best and most interesting worldbuilding. I mean, fairies? Yes. Dark and lethal fairies? Gimme gimme!! Also, I liked the fact that there were many different settings and not principally in a specific place like my latest read book, Cruel Beauty (which was also a very good but quite different book.) The characters were very entertaining and riveting. And there were quite some to fantasize about. A reason why I love reading urban fantasy series is that they remind me of action-packed TV shows. And I can never get enough of them. I love seeing the character developpements from the first to the final books. I like my heroines kick-ass, smart and independent so Mackayla Lane was a bright shinning star for me. I think I'm in the minority here, but I didn't get all crazy and fangirl on Jericho as most of you who read this book may did. Maybe I was supposed to succumb at his charm, but I didn't. Maybe it's because of the fact that him and Mac didn't meet at an interesting moment for me. And a book shop? Meeeh. I love book shops, but it's just not the place I was expecting. I may not have swooned over him, but he definitely was a nicely built and thought of character. My own personal fantasy is V'lane: To every person who has yet to read this book, do so. I'm (almost) positively sure you will be a satisfied reader and will enjoy it in one way or another. Happy reading! ...more Second reread: Oct 2015.

Upgrading my rating to 4.5 Stars It was a hard decision not to read this one sooner and I'm glad I waited, I've found an awesome BR Group out there, full of weirdos where fun never ends ^^ Walking into the Dark Zone again was an about time enjoyable experience. My first was like every first. Rushed and awkward. But now that I know what I know, I can say without a single doubt Karen Marie Moning is a fecking genius. This is so far the best UF I've ever read. The MC's POV trapped me since the beginning, foreshadowing being the key word. \"It began small and innocuously, as most catrastophes do.\" Barbie Mac is here, people. Annoyingly blonde, a walking catrastrophe in pink. The thing is, my first time I was so closed-minded, bothering about little details like \" why is this chick so worried about her looks?? \" or \" when is Barron gonna be a good boy?\" or the worst kind: \" What is he?\" . Who the fuck cares? \"Don't put labels, Ms. Liz. Don't try to perfectly understand everything. Life is not perfect. Deal with it\", he would say. And he would be right, of course. Moning was shouting the plot to me, waving her hands saying: Hey, loser, we've got more than just pink over here! Really look at me! Those are little details, the craziness is about to happen and you need to be ready! But I was too obtuse to even notice it. \"The only good Fae is a dead Fae in my book.\" Warning: Spoilers of the whole series. Don't read it unless you've finished Shadowfever. (view spoiler) [ \"One day I would stop taking off my clothes in front of V'lane's presence, but the cost of that resistance would be a piece of my soul.\" Even if I think V'lane is a smart addition, super hot and sexy, I couldn't deny the fact that the fourth fucker raped her. And it doesn't matter how he tried to explain it to her later. I'm so glad Mac never felt nothing more than just the usual Fae attraction. I remember thinking he was better than Barrons. BETTER THAN BARRONS, MY PETUNIA. However, I really liked V'lane. As in \"the guy who understood her and looked after her parents and put his name in his tongue in a really super sexy way\". The idea of this good Seelie gave me peace whenever Barrons was busy being a douchebag. Cruce, my friends, is another story. (hide spoiler) ] Barrons' omnipresent carnality didn't bothered me anymore. I just relaxed, took the best sit and tasted every tease, every flirtatious moment and even his eternal, jackass commentaries. Any Barrons is a delicious Barrons in my book. I'm so pleased to be back in Dublin, falling in love with this amazing city again! ___________ First Read (October 2013) 3.5 Stars (view spoiler) [I blame all of you for the high expectations I had for this book. I'm not sure why but I'm between three and four stars. Let me tell you one thing: Darkfever kick asses. It is indeed an awesome series, I can feel it. I'm excited about this flawless world-building. I'm even more excited about the Jericho/Mac relationship. I'm so intrigued about Mac's sister murderer and it's obvious we know nothing about what really happened. I can tell there's so much more to find out and Karen Marie Moning is one of those rare authors that won't give you a stupid, whinny MC or a douchebag for a love interest. Now, why the hesitation? It's because of all the hype. I mean, I though Jericho was synonymous of sexy times, a steamy relationship or a forbidden love. In the end, they're building a dangerous relationship. The tension was there, Jericho's hotness and maleness was there but nothing calm the needs I had for something a little more explicit, if you know what I mean. I know, I'm always complaining about how easily UF's girls loose their pants but what do women want, right? I didn't feel that attracted to Jericho. Yeah, he was hot and I love how rude he was with her (that says so much about my loving life...) but I wasn't swooning for him. Something inside me says: NOT YET... I'm listening. Coming back to the awesomeness: 50% of the book and still Mac was trying to be logical about this new paranormal world. Can you believe it? Not a TSTL Mary Sue, though at first I didn't like her, Mac proved to be a great character and her evolution was incredible. What's this sorcery? a story where things actually make sense? yeah. She lost her sister and you can tell she's not over it and she won't till she avenge her sister. Not for a moment, not even when V'lane was near, she forgot the emptiness and injustice of her sister's death. I also love the POV. Mac tells the story a year ahead from and adult, mature POV. She knows exactly what went wrong before us and that made this so addictive. \"Why would she say that? What's she not telling me? Why would she regret that decision later?\" I'm telling you, it only took me a few pages to feel excited about it and I've already started reading the second book.

MacKayla Lane has her life together: a loving family she adores, a sister that is also a best friend, a job that pays in the environment she thrives in (partying) and courses at the local community college to keep things interesting (and her father off her back about finding a \"proper\" job). Everything is just perfect. Until Mac's sister, Alina, is found dead in a trash-filled alley in Dublin, where she'd gone to study at Trinity College. With no suspects, evidence, or arrests, the Dublin police make quick work of the case and waste no time in closing it. Alina wasn't just my sister; she was my best friend. Though she'd been away studying at Trinity College in Dublin for the past eight months, we'd emailed incessantly and spoken weekly, sharing everything, keeping no secrets. Or so I thought. Boy was I ever wrong. With a family torn apart by grief, Mac decides to take matters into her own hands and fly to Dublin. She was going to catch the killer herself, or at least convince the Garda to reopen the case, thanks to a voicemail left by Alina on Mac's the phone hours before she died. \"Oh, Mac, everything has gone so wrong! I thought I knew what I was going, I thought he was helping me, but -- God, I can't believe I was so stupid! I thought I was in love with him and he's one of them, Mac! One of them!\" But once in Dublin, Mac realises things aren't going to be as easy as she'd hoped, and that Dublin in't what it seems. Abandoned streets, strangely forgotten by the public, lead her to Barrons Books & Baubles one foggy, wet night. Barrons Books & Baubles seemed to stand bastion between the good part of the city and the bad. To my right, street lamps spilled warm amber light, and people called to each other, laughing and talking. To my left, what few streetlamp still worked shed a sickly, pale glow, and the silence was broken only by the occasional door banging on broken hinges in the wind. That night, she meets the enigmatic Jericho Barrons, book collector and owner of Barrons Books & Baubles, and he is nothing if not forceful and adamant that she must leave Ireland. \"You, Ms. Lane, are in way over your head. Take my advice and extricate yourself while it's still possible.\" Barron's is dead set on running Mac out of town, but then he realises they could be of use to each other. Mac, he discovers, is a sidle-seer , a powerful human being that can see the face, and her unique gift of sensing Fae Hallows is of much use to him. Soon, Mac and Barrons forge a reluctant partnership -- Barrons will keep her alive in a world quickly being overrun by paranormal monsters, and in exchange, Mac will help Barrons find the Sinsar Dubh. \"The Sinsar Dubh is a book.\" \"A book? THat's all? Just a book?\" It seemed terrible anti-climactic. \"On the contrary, Ms. Lane, never make that mistake. It is an exceedingly rare and exceeding ancient manuscript countless people would kill to possess.\" \"Including you? Would you kill to possess it?\" I needed to know exactly where we stood, he and I. \"Absolutely.\" There are numerous reasons why I love the Fever series: the setting (Ireland and Scotland have been two obsessions of mine from a very young age), the characters (Mac and Barrons in particular, but the entire cast is just wonderful and perfectly done), the plot, histories and legends incorporated so well you'd think Ireland truly was infested by murderous castes of Fae ready to take over the world. As this reader's second reread, Darkfever , the first book in the series, revealed many plot points easily missed or overlooked the first time. In a fantastical world on the bring of a terrifying, supernatural war, it's a race against time to find the Sinsar Dubh. Everyone wants it, and they will go to extreme lengths to get their greedy hands on it. Karen Marie Moning's very clever creation of a \"rainbow\" girl (a lover of boys, gossip, clothes, parties and expensive shoes) turning \"dark\" illustrates how desperately this particular character wants to survive and avenge her sister's brutal death. Each character is completely and wildly different to the next, bringing new excitement to the page as it is difficult to predict what will happen next. Also, the tension is one to savour. With battles that spike your adrenaline and thick mystery you can cut with a knife, Darkfever is definitely a book to read and, hopefully, adore. Review also coming to 100% Rock Magazine! After Reread: 30/12/15-06/01/16 I love rereading books for the simple fact that you miss so much when you're ripping through a treasure-trove of a book the first time. The excitement is high, your gut is twisting, your heart is hammering and you just HAVE to know what happens next. The second time is a lot smoother, and you can soak up the details better: the whens and hows and whos and whys. I had many a \"AH HA!\" moment whilst reading and things that were lost on me the first time (and things I forgot as I read more of the series) made a lot more sense. Considering I read the first five books in four days, I can say with certainty that not much stuck in my head except that it was awesome, kickass, fast paced and that I loved Mac and Barrons unconditionally. This time around, I can't wait to really READ it and hopefully write a more coherent review. The below quote is still one of my favourites. Full review to come! \"Assume makes an ass out of 'u' and 'me'.\" I dare you to not read Darkfever. I dare you to not enjoy Mac's internal narration, and her curse-word substitutes: \"petunia\" for ass and \"frog\" for fuck. I dare you to try and stay away from Barrons. I dare you to not like this new, invigorating, glorious plot. I dare you to not like every single character you meet, no matter how much of a dickhead they turn out to be. I dare you to not love the rich background provided, and the histories shown. I dare you to not fall for all the different species that stalk through the pages of this book. I dare you to not argue with your feels on more than one occasion. I dare you to not laugh even at the soberest of times, or when something awful has happened, because the narration is just quirky enough to alleviate the tension for ten seconds. I dare you to not get all flustered and hot when Barrons speaks, even if you end up hating him immensely half the time, and wanting to punch him for the other half because he's an Alpha male dickhead who will not give you any sort of reasoning for his actions. I dare you to read the rich descriptions of Ireland and Dublin, and not want to go there. I dare you to not adore Mac, even when she's trying to be kick-ass and fails miserably. I dare you to read this and not wish some of it to be real, even if that wish implies terrifying monsters walking the streets. I dare you to read Darkfever and not love it. Pre-Review The \"Glossary From Mac's Journal\" is one reason why you should read this book. It contains treasures such as 'death-by-sex Fae' and 'many mouthed thing'. Seriously. This book is not only brilliant, but hilarious too. I love Mac.

When there are no clear leads to who the killer might have been, the police quickly pronounce Alina's murder case closed. But MacKayla \"Mac\" is determined to find out what happened to her beloved sister and she decides to take matters into her own hands. On her quest towards the truth, she decides to go to Dublin and find out who killed her sister so justice can finally be served. What she doesn't expect to find there is a whole new world of darkness and danger in which none of the players can be trusted or believed. Not long after her arrival, Mac discovers there's more evil in the world than she could have ever imagined and everything she's believed up until now seems doubtful and uncertain. Threats lurk around every corner in the city and no one seems to want her around. Jericho Barrons is the one who eventually offers her protection and solace in the choatic and danger-filled city of Dublin. Barrons is the enigmatic, mysterious and slighty dangerous awner of the bookstore \"Barrons: Books and Baubles\". \"He wasn't handsome. That was too calm a word. He was intensely masculien. He was sexual. He attracted. There was an omnipresent carnality about him, in his dark eyes, in his full mouth, 'n the way he stood. Gewas the kind of man I wouldn't flirt with in a thousand years.\" I he was winter, I was summer. If I was sunshine, he was night. A dark and stormy one. Barrons helps her in her quest for the truth but his biggest prioriteit is finding the Sinsar Dubh aka the Dark Book. One of the dark Hallows and the most powerful relic created by the King of the Unseelie. Since finding the Book was Alina's dying wish, Mac assists Barrons in his searching that leads them to the most dangerous and untrustworthy habitats of the city. And then there's V'Lane , Prince of the Seelie and right hand of the Seelie Queen. With his power, he's able to seduce any woman he comes across and leave them broken and deranged once he's finished with them. Still, this Seelie seems to be \"one of the good guys\" who offers Mac protection in exchange for her help in his own quest of the Dark Book. But Mac still doesn't trust him; because with the Fae, you never know which hidden agenda they might have. \"Dealing with the Fae is like dealing with any addiction - you give in, they'll own you; you resist, they never will.\" In this intricately designed web of lies, danger and deceive, who will Mac be able to trust? Will she ever find her sister's murderer and the much needed satisfaction of revenge? The end of this first part of the series does not end with a cliffhanger, but it did leave me wanting much more answers! I started reading the next book, Bloodfever , right away! \"There are really only two positions one can take toward anything in life: hope or fear. Hope strenghtens, fear kills.\" ...more Third Read: October 2015 - 8 stars! Second Read: November 2014 - 5 stars!

I freaking LOVE this series!!! GAH!!! Every time, I pick up something new or remember a forgotten detail. It's just brilliant. My favorite series. I loved Barrons more this time around too. I don't know how I'm going to wait until November 9th to re-read Bloodfever! Second read thoughts (Nov 2014) : This is the first series I've re-read here at Goodreads, and I have to say, it's better this time around than the first! Oh, how I love this series! First books in a series can be rocky, but this may be the best first book in a series I've ever read. It has its flaws and the original setup always takes away some of the excitement because that stuff is never as fun to read as the action scenes. Re-reading it has made me really appreciate the brilliance of KMM. (I'm not fangirling, really. Ok, maybe a little.) The world-building, even in book one, is impressive. I've always been a fan of Mac, and her original Barbie persona never grated on me. I love how clueless she is in this, but fiercely dedicated to her family. She's completely alone thousands of miles from home with only a maybe-psychotic (but sexy) man as a mentor (?) and a bunch of evil monster fairies, and I think she catches on and transforms pretty quickly. Now Barrons. It took probably until book 3 before I started to really like him, but I think I understand him a little bit more this time around. He's still an asshole, but Mac does deserve some of his harsh comments. (view spoiler) [ Besides, Barrons is still more of the ancient animal at this point in the story. Mac humanizes him a lot in the later books. (hide spoiler) ] Mmmm, Barrons. I know most people picture David Gandy as Barrons, but I can picture a few others as him as well. Jason Momoa. Joe Manganiello. I know he would be too old now, but Gerard Butler. Luke Evans. I just realized I must like guys with facial hair a lot. Hmmm. Anyways, awesome start to an awesome series. I have no complaints. It's a short book, easy to read. You might not like Mac at first because she begins as a superficial person with not a lot going on upstairs. You might not even like Barrons, for that matter. Barrons is the alpha's Alpha, and for some people, reading that can be an annoying deal-breaker. He's a jerk and mean to Mac a lot at first. But it all makes sense as the story builds (at least to me). That is the only type of \"warning\" I could give potential readers (I mean besides other stuff like, there's sex and cursing in this series, but most people who would read this probably could care less about that and probably prefer plenty of both - haha). So, if you like urban fantasy, this is UF at its best. Original review: This is a quick, fun read. I like that it's written in a simple, easy to read manner. Mac is hilarious. She's smart, but at the same time perfectly fits that stereotypical Barbie blond. Barrons is intriguing. I know this is only the first book, so everything is just being set up. I'm not quite sure that I get his fangirl appeal at this point, although he is definitely a great mysterious character. The two of them bickering is fun to read. I really want to know what he is. This was a good series beginner. I will definitely continue reading...[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I admit, I struggled at the beginning of this.

Mac is on a mission to find her sister's killer, much like Veronica's quest to find her best friends killer .

But that is where most of the similarities end. Unless there was an alternate season on VM where she deals with crazy creatures from another realm. Mac is quite a paradox , being a fashionista and brightly-colored-clothes-hor who brushes her hair 100 strokes like freakin Marsha Brady, and an exotic car enthusiast with a dash of rough and tumble, or in other words: Supernatural Barbie, who kicks wicked Unseelie ass by the way. The long-time-coming fight scenes were sa-weet and unraveled like a movie in your mind! Now, I must warn some of you that she may come off as annoying at first. This is intentional, as to see how much Mac changes by the end. This is Mac 1.0 and the least awesome of her many versions. I love her theory about men who wear all black: They either want to be trouble or they are trouble. They are also my favorite!! Angel, Spike (isn't it amazing how the characters from the Buffyverse don't really even need more than one name?), Damon Salvatore, Johnny Cash, etc... Despite the fact that I kept thinking the name Mac Barrons sounds like a male porn star name, I liked both MacKayla Lane and Jericho Barrons. Though her calling him Barrons weirds me out a little. Jericho is a much better sounding name. Her whole cussing system is fecking hilarious. I was raised without curse words as well and though I cuss at times now, more often than not I inadvertently fall back on my \"substitutes\". One of them being the same as hers and my fave: Fudge Bucket. My repertoire has been expanding over the years through many different sources: since reading Leviathan - Barking Spiders!, watching Craig Ferguson - Oh Biscuits!, Chelsea Handler's pickachu, and save the best for last - Frak! If you don't know what that's from, I feel sorry for you that you've never had the pleasure of watching BSG. The description of Barrons Books and Baubles was perfect to the point that it sparked a great debate inside my head. The nature of that debate was trying to determine which body part I would be willing to give up to visit such a place. Not sure I would give up a kidney, but the appendix did not seem worthy enough. I determined the acceptable sacrifice would be my belly-button. Yeah, I would totally give up my innie (and I am rather attached to it) and rock it Kyle XY-style to visit Barrons Books and Baubles. That store sounds amazing! The way she acted around death-by-sex-Fae-guy-whose-name-I-don't-like-either was thoroughly entertaining. I was actually surprised she didn't swell up with a hysterical pregnancy and start lactating right there in the middle of the museum. Geez. Those parts of the book didn't do anything for me but cause a fit of the giggles. If forced to choose one word to describe this book, it would be \"consistent\". It was easy to read and never lulled or grew too suspenseful. The story stayed in a constant state of intrigue. I'm greatly looking forward to the next, which I think I might pick up in just a few seconds. Mostly, I'm looking forward to some bow-chicka-wow-wow between Mac and Jericho. Aaaah, will I ever get used to calling him Barrons? EDIT: There is something I want to clear up. Just something that I noticed a lot of people have been making comments about. Everyone keeps referring to the Fae as being aliens , which is not entirely accurate. There is only one mention of the Fae being \"aliens\" and it is in a snarky remark and assumption made by Mac. Barrons doesn't actually confirm the remark, like usual, he just answers her with a question \"You didn't think they were natives, did you?\" The Fae are in no way ET or the Buggers. They are an inter-dimensional race , not at all unlike most mythology about the Fae or demons or other supernatural beings. Just like in Buffy. I know, it's a shocker that I brought that show into this conversation. I NEVER do that. But if you love Buffy and her forbidden relationships, then you will love this series. The first book is by far the most lackluster, but it is still good. Stick with it. Each consecutive book gets better and better. An amazing series!! A must read for paranormal fans. My review for the second book, Bloodfever . The third book, Faefever . The fourth book, Dreamfever . The fifth and final book, Shadowfever . ...more Wow. Mac was really fucking annoying during the first half of this book. I can see why someone might DNF this thing. Really. When I originally read this in 2009, I hadn't read thousands of books with a paranormal twist, and the market wasn't overflowing with books about evil fairies, so this was a new sort of book for me. And I loved it. However, if this was my first time reading it now , I might have tossed it out the window after Mac gave her explanation for substitute swear words. Ass = Petunia &a Wow.

Fortunately, I already knew that this version of Mac was going to be replaced by a better, stronger, cooler, and far less strangle-worthy version. Mac: Mac 2.0: Second time around I now have an appreciation for some of folks who maybe didn't love this book, but my feelings on it didn't change. None of my favorite urban fantasy series had a 1st book that blew me out of the water. Some of them, like Kate Daniels, I didn't like enough to even go back and attempt the second book for years . So, it doesn't bother me that Darkfever has a few glitches, because it also has Jericho Barrons. I have many Book Boyfriends, but Barrons is... Barrons . I can't even explain much I love him. LOVE him. Do not get on my thread and tell me you don't understand why. Seriously.
