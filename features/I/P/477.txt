Woah. This is one unsettling little thriller and the best bit about it is that no one can be trusted , including the three female narrators who share the storytelling of this book. I literally read this entire novel in one sitting and I now need to find the words to convince you to go get your hands on it. RIGHT NOW. Between an alcoholic, a liar and a cheat, who can you trust? These are the three women at the centre of this book: Rachel, Anna and Megan. Have you ever sat on the train, glanced at the people around you or out of the window, and made up stories about them? Maybe you've even gone so far as to invent names for these people and imagine their perfect or not-so-perfect lives. Rachel is that girl on the train who takes her mind off her own life by imagining the lives of others. Specifically the lives of \"Jess and Jason\" who live at the house outside her train window when the train stops at the same red signal every morning. But then one morning, things are not as they are supposed to be and Rachel sees something that completely shatters the \"Jess and Jason\" image which exists in her head. Now she is pulled into their lives. Unsure exactly what she knows but certain she cannot rest until she finds out. This book is just full of secrets. Everyone has them. It's about all the little mysteries that exist just outside of what we see on the surface. What goes on behind closed doors? How much can you ever really know a person? What horrors exist in that black spot of your memory from Saturday night? It was fascinating, gripping and oh so very creepy. Hawkins has been added to the small group of thriller authors on my \"must buy\" list.

These are some fucked up characters.

The thing is...It gets frigging boring. I wanted a bus to hit them all. Repeatedly. May go sorta spoilery: You have Rachel. Rachel is a drunk, she gets on the 8:04 train every morning and then on again in the afternoon on her way home. Pretending to go to work. (She got fired for drinking and basically acting a damn fool)..so she goes on that same train every day. Sometimes she can't wait to take a drink before she gets home. She sees \"Jess and Jason\" everyday. Or that's what she calls them in her head. They live near her old home. Where she lived with her ex-husband (who cheated on her). Coincidence? I think not. She sees Jess kissing a guy that isn't Jason. So her little mind starts to working. Then Jess aka Megan goes missing. Rachel then decides to go to the police with what she knows. Then the police find out she is not the most reliable of witnesses and tell her to stay out of it. Of course, that's not happening. Now for the twist. That one I saw coming and kept thinking \"no way\" it can't be that easy. This book wouldn't be so popular. I need to stay away from super, duper popular books. Because, I'm just calling Bullshit. The writing is not bad in this book, so I'm not giving it the rating for that. I'm giving it the rating because I personally hated it. #trollscankissmyfatass ...more 4.5 stars Everyone in this book is absolutely terrible , and as a result, this book is a masterpiece in character study and development.

To feel pity, disgust, frustration, compassion, and so much more for one character is a rare thing.

I have literally no idea why there are so many 5 star ratings. It kind of scares me. If this kind of garbage is what the masses find appealing...I mean.. I didn't care at all about the \"mystery.\" It didn't even feel like there was one. It just felt like a tedious glimpse into the messed up lives of people I'd rather not know anything about. Good read but the ending fell a little flat for me I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men, men she'd just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street.

At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end. it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them \"jess and jason,\" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses \"jess\" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that \"jess,\" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not. ...more I just sent a 3 page, 3,000 word email about why I didn't like this book to a friend, and I still feel the urge to express myself.

Bleugh. The 'plot twist' is easy to guess not even halfway through the book, and the who-dun-it moment, where we find out who the bad guy is, while predictable, doesn't make any sense to me, considered how this book is written and what we know about the characters. Exposition, people. There isn't any. You might argue that it's because of the unreliable narrator, but I'm not buying it. Good writing works its way around it. Also, I didn't know 'thriller' translated to 'no character development'. And have I mentioned the clumsy writing? Because I was getting secondhand embarrassment 85% of the time. This book was, above all things (that I honestly didn't care about), awkward. ...more \u201cEsssscuse me. Is this seat taken? Thanks. I like to sits bys the wimdow.

I better go *BURP* tell the cops about this\u2026.But first Imma gonna puke all over your shoes. Sorry about this\u2026\u2026..\u201d ***** That\u2019s what this book feels like, that you got stuck sitting next to a sloppy drunk who is telling you this story, and maybe you feel a little bad for her even as you\u2019re trying to avoid her spilling her drink on you. After listening to her inebriated babblings for a very short while you immediately know more about her situation than she does, and you could easily tell her what she missed. But then you catch a whiff of her breath so you just try to sneak away when she\u2019s not paying attention. Seriously, I might have liked this more if I hadn\u2019t figured out who the culprit was about three minutes into the book. ...more What a huge disappointment. The concept sounded amazing, and it got off to a promising...if slow...start. But it quickly turned into this messy, melodramatic story that was neither surprising, or original. Much like in Gone Girl, there was not a single likable character in the entire book. That wasn't the main problem for me, though. I could see the ending coming from a mile away. Actually more like I figured out who the main villan was within the first 20 pages. Never a ringing endorsement. I am so disappointed in this one. It started out promising enough, but the writing and the drama got old fast. There was really only one person who could have done it, and because of that I kept thinking it must be someone else. But it wasn't someone else. It was THAT PERSON. By the time the big reveal happened, I was so ready for the whole thing to just be over already. I started out thinking I had a 4 star book in my hands. Halfway through I was looking for an excuse to give it 3 stars. Finall I am so disappointed in this one.

Well I'm in a generous mood (or kind of disappointed in myself for buying into the hype) and 2 stars is what I'm giving it. My advice (which you probably shouldn't take because everyone else is loving it) is to skip this one entirely. A weak 2 stars. ...more Pfffiou...

But one written so clumsily and shallow that I was annoyed, not intrigued, by her. The plot\u2019s mystery falls flat because it is done in such a heavy-handed way. The shift between narrative points of view and the two timelines seem like an artificial way of keeping the reader in the dark. The alcohol-induced blackouts of the main character just add to that feeling. I constantly thought \u201coh, how convenient that she does not remember that\u201d and \u201coh, how convenient she can recall a tiny detail now\u201d. It was simply clumsy and trite. However, the worst thing about Rachel, the protagonist and main narrator, weren\u2019t the clich\u00e9s about alcoholism and divorced women. These aspects annoyed me to no end but the absolute worst thing about Rachel and the two other female narrators was how pathetic they were. Throughout the book I got the feeling that <---A>Paula Hawkins</---A> must hate women; hate them with a passion. Women in this novel are portrayed as unstable (going on batshit crazy), weak, dependent (on men), and insecure. Every single woman mentioned defines her personality in relation to a man. They doubt themselves, their capabilities and decisions. The men, in contrast, are all mysterious but strong and sure of themselves. They are there to give definition and meaning to their wives, girlfriends, mistresses, and sons. Even those women on the side-lines of the plot are only defined by their relationships to men. For instance, Rachel\u2019s mother; she is only mentioned two or three times and the one time she actually gets a few lines is when she explains how she\u2019s not able to help her daughter at the moment because she has a new \u201cfriend\u201d and she doesn\u2019t want to scare him off like that! Seriously? Also, Rachel\u2019s roommate is supposed to be the one thinking clearly; she tries to keep Rachel sober and wants her to go to AA meetings, get a grip on life, and so on. Still, even the supposedly reasonable character is defined by her boyfriend. When she\u2019s not home she is with him and when he is out of town for some reason she sits at home waiting for him. And these are only the minor female characters in this novel. Rachel, Anna, and Megan are all pathetic in their very own way. They pine about the men that leave or reject them; they doubt their life decisions and still won\u2019t change anything in order not to upset their men. And every single thought they have is about how their decisions or actions might affect their husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, or lovers. I know I\u2019m ranting a bit here, but this really really annoyed me. I also know what Hawkins was trying to do. She wanted to show the dark side of domestic life \u2013 just like Gone Girl did. But in my opinion she has utterly failed to do so. ...more I read this one out of curiosity. Aware that it had been a huge market success, I wondered if it merited the sales.

I do not mean to say that The Girl\u2026 is a bad book. Although I believe it to be seriously flawed, it is most definitely entertaining and will no doubt help hundreds of thousands of readers while away a few hours of their (our) lives, getting from this station to that. But if you want a psychological thriller that doesn\u2019t disregard red signals you would do better to book a seat elsewhere. Paula Hawkins <---C>Rachel Watson</---C> has had a tough go of it. When her hopes of having a baby with hubby Tom did not work out, she landed in a trough of post-hope depression, and self-medicated with a steady flow of what seemed happier spirits. It did not work out. Now, divorced and unemployed as a result of her drinking, growing larger and pastier by the day, Rachel rides the commuter train to London on weekday mornings, pretending she is still working, pretending she still has a life. The ride takes her past her old neighborhood, offering a nice, mood dampening view of a stretch of railroad-edge homes. She used to live in one of those, before her ex bought out her interest. A few places away from her former home there is a couple she sees most days. She imagines lives for them, nursing this fantasy for quite some time, until she learns that the woman has vanished, and the game is afoot. The notion for the story occurred to Hawkins on her regular train ride in London some years back. She calls it \u201cRear-Window-ish,\u201d noting that it is hardly unusual for train riders to be curious about the lives being lived in the houses they pass, and just as likely for those on the ground to wonder about those passing by. I used to go to college on the District line,\u201d she said. \u201cIt goes very, very slowly and you can look into people\u2019s houses. I did idly wonder about what you would do if you saw an act of violence or something suspicious. It\u2019s quite normal, everyone is curious about other people\u2019s lives.\u201d - from an article in the Standard This irregular Watson will not make anyone forget the investigative Doctor, let alone his illustrious partner, but Rachel feels compelled to find out whatever she can, using the knowledge she has gleaned from her daily observations. We expect our investigators these days to be a bit down on their luck, and to throw back maybe more than their share of amber liquid. But Rachel Watson doesn\u2019t have a drinking problem, she has a drinking catastrophe. How is she to figure out whither the missing lady has gone, or perhaps who made her go missing, how is she to judge whether the lady\u2019s anger-management-challenged husband, the other man she saw at her place, or someone else might be somehow involved, if her drinking causes her to have more blackouts than London during the blitz. The tale is told in staggered chronology, from three perspectives. Rachel\u2019s, the missing person\u2019s, and Anna\u2019s, she being the woman with whom Rachel\u2019s ex cheated while he was still with Rachel, and whom he subsequently married. Or she said, she said, and then she said. The timelines converge at the end. Most sections are divided into sub headings of morning, evening, afternoon, that sort. It makes for many short passages, good, appropriately, for reading on a train. This is an example of the S stock used on the District line Hawkins once rode The pace of the tale is quick, clickety-clacking along without exceeding posted limits, advancing nicely to the big climax. Truthfulness comes in for some attention, as it seems everyone has something to hide. If you are looking for likeable characters, you might try the Hogwarts Express. The folks here tote enough baggage to merit their own cars. I suppose Rachel is sympathetic, but seems almost as much an agent of her misery as a victim. Making her pathetic and annoying was, I expect, a way to make her real, make her sympathetic, and that works, to a point. Will Rachel find out what happened with the missing woman? Will her ex take out an order of protection against her, as she keeps calling and showing up at his place? Is the missing person merely missing? or worse? Can Rachel stay sober long enough to figure anything out? You might very well care. Clearly, judging by sales, many do. But, while I did, a little, I felt pushed away by this book. I felt cheated, as an actual audience member, as if riding on a disoriented express. I do understand that the unreliable narrator is simply a story-telling mechanism and that Rachel falls into the Madman classification within that, but when she changes her story about a significant piece of information the story went off the rails for me. So, while there is plenty to enjoy about The Girl on the Train , while there is plenty of tension-release-repeat, and while many readers are bound to be transported by the story, relating to or rooting for one or more characters at least some of the time, the one thing a reader demands from an author is honesty, and when trust is lost so is the benefit of the several hours we spend together. The locomotive was transformed, for me, into a hand-car trapped in a siding. It\u2019s elementary.

She got work writing chick-lit under the name Amy Silver, an experience that she says was great training. Hawkins, born and raised in Zimbabwe, was 17 when her family moved to London. She had wanted to be a foreign correspondent like her father, but decided that war zones were just too scary. Check the Guardian piece if you are interested in getting more info on the author.

No, I\u2019m kidding! I\u2019m your friendly reviewer, surely you can trust me ... ...bwa-ha-ha-ha!!! Okay, enough misleading malevolent mirth... for the moment... BROKEN DOLLS There\u2019s nothing so painful, so corrosive as suspicion. In this story you will have three voices in your head... Rachel: An alcoholic woman who failed in marriage. Megan: A pretentious woman who succeed in cheating. Anna: A married woman who who succeed in pretention. All of them are unlikely protagonists, hardly role models, sinners paying for their own faults, broken dolls in the middle of a railroad where fate is the train. They did their mistakes, but your own mistake can be to trust them... or me... ...bwa-ha-ha-ha!!! WHAT WORKED BEFORE, WILL WORK AGAIN There\u2019s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home. You may heard that this story is the \u201cnew\u201d Gone Girl , and you would have heard well then. Actually, while it\u2019s understandable that everybody knows about Gone Girl , there is another newer book that it could considered too into the formula in a sense... Gone Girl meets Elizabeth is Missing And also, there are two movies that came to my mind, no wonder, from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock (who I have no doubt that if he would be still alive, he would adapt into a film this novel)... Rear Window meets The Lady Vanishes That, yes, they were based on previously printed material too. So, if you are fair familiarized with all those mentioned stories, you can quite well expect lots of trains, losses of memory, missing women, vouyerisms and misleadings... Bwa-ha-ha-ha!!!... wait! Why did I laughed this time? I believe that it\u2019s one of the moments where you can trust me more... or isn\u2019t? EVERYTHING IS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis. You may notice or not, while reading the different railroads, that the debutant, Paula Hawkins, the author, didn\u2019t put anything random on the book, everything is according to the plan, even the dates, that honestly, they aren\u2019t easy to keep on mind, but even those dates denote different kind of railway engines, while a side of the story can be told as a paused steam locomotive, another side is indeed a bullet train. But in any case, life hardly can be told in an instant, even the fastest deposition needs time, life is rich, life is complex, and if there is a saying that \u201ceach man is a world\u201d, well I can say that each woman is an universe, a wonderful universe full of surprises, and while maybe in a whole another kind of context but (death) is hardly an ending, but just other twist in life. And what could be life without those wonderful unexpected twists? ...more This is the perfect weekend read. I settled into the story and spent most of Sunday (a dark and stormy afternoon) reading away. Murder. Public Drunkenness. Infidelity. Unreliable Narrators. Treat Yo Self. This was a perfectly decent, well-crafted thriller, which I happened not to like very much, for reasons that have little to do with its craft or its quality. This sometimes happens, and it doesn't mean that others won't enjoy it. The plot is fast-moving and with some real surprises. The portrayal of alcoholism is great (although I would have liked it to go further into the more visceral details, rather than skimming the surface of the theme).

However (and yes, I know it's trivial, but) the title. I'm getting tired of these vaguely infantilizing titles that refer to mature women as \"girls\" (although, to be honest, none of the female characters seemed at all mature to me). The multiple-person narration was nicely-handled, except that all three narrators sounded the same, to the extent of noticing the same things and recording them in the exact same register and vocabulary. And although I have no problem enjoying books with unsympathetic characters, I found the women in this book not only unsympathetic, but really rather dull, relying on the \"damaged woman\" trope for interest, rather than investing the characters with anything more tangible. The publishers are pushing this book as a second GONE GIRL. I was hoping for something new. Not this time, I'm afraid. ...more Half a \"what the hell happened ?\" star !!! 2016 Worst Read of the Year Original Review written October 3, 2016 Update : October 25, 2016 (mini review of the film !!)

This is the main reason I read the book as we had planned this outing for months and then I read the book just before the film came out. As you prolly already know I abhored the book so I was grotesquely curious about the film. First though I want to give the rating of my lovely galpals when I polled them afterwards over omelettes !! Gal One : Book 4 stars Film 3.5 stars Gal Two: Book 4 stars Film 3 stars Gal Three: Book 3 stars Film 4 stars Gal Four: Book 3 stars Film 3 stars BF - refused to read the book Film 3 stars Jaidee Book 0.5 star Film 1.5 stars (in comparison Gone Girl Book 2.5 stars Film 3 stars) The film was seriously lacking, terrible dialogue, fairly poor acting (with a few exceptions), mostly very dull when it was not ridiculous. What I liked - Emily Blunt gave a 3 star decent performance There was some really cool art and some beautiful brief cinematography Saving Grace: Officer Riley played by Allison Janney was awesome. She had the right amount of wit and chutzpah for the role. She shone in her brief moments. Plus I love the way she is aging...so beautiful in a natural and haggard way. Am I glad I saw it ? Yes...time with my good friends and holding hands with my BF is always nice. Am I glad I read the book? Hell No!! Original review September 26, 2016: This book makes Gone Girl look like a masterpiece !!! At six percent I was very pleasantly surprised. At eighty-seven percent I wanted to tear my hair out on the ludicrousness and ridiculousness of this book. Recipe for this disaster - you start with three of the most unlikable women (ever...i mean ever) and you stir slowly ( one is a pathetic alcoholic, the other is narcissistic and the third is troubled) until they are mixed so thoroughly that you can't tell them apart except that you hate them all -you start with an excellent premise that goes nowhere and so you have all three women terribly dependent on the men in their lives except they all cheat on the men in their lives and they all hate each other which makes you hate them even more -oh all the women are liars, cheats and oh so bored with their pampered lives....oh lets blame this on trauma, hardships , grief....ya we can be assholes becuz we hurt so bad.....now not only do you hate them...you want to bitch slap them too....but oh no you cant do that because they do it to each other and plan each other's physical and psychological demise ..... -just when you think it can't get any worse...yes you got it...let's blame it on a man....oh yes he is a sociopath and yes all three women love him...boo hoo hoo -do we know what motivates these women (of course we don't) just suspend your disbelief so far that you think you might be on Pluto !!! Sorry for the rant but this book is a bloody train wreck and how it won the awards and accolades it has is beyond me. I apologize Ms. Flynn...you don't seem nearly so bad any more. Not only should I not have not gotten on this stupid train but I should have ran away instead. Bloody Awful :( ...more *3.5* I feel like the main reason I didn't love this book was because of my expectations being way too high. I had heard that it was \"the next Gone Girl\", and I can completely understand where that comparison comes from.

I wanted to read something along the same vein as Gone Girl, but not an exact replica. This wasn't an exact replica, but there were enough similarities that it sort turned me off a teensy bit. As most people have said, this is one of those books where NOBODY CAN BE TRUSTED. All of the characters are horrible in some way, and you never really know who did what. There are sort of six main characters in this book (three men and three women, one of whom goes missing) and the synopsis tells us that (view spoiler) [\"only one of them can be the killer!\". So, um, thanks for the spoiler, synopsis. Now we not only know that the woman who went missing DIES, but also that one of the five others definitely did it. (hide spoiler) ] THAT TOOK AWAY FROM THE INTRIGUE A BIT. Another thing that sort of deflated the BIG REVEAL for me was that I had a really twisted theory about one of the characters, and it didn't come true. This may not seem like a big deal, but I feel like the author inserted some very specific clues that led me in that direction, and I was disappointed that it didn't end up being true. (I'll talk more about this in the liveshow at the end of the month, so make sure you read the book so we can discuss it in all of its spoilery glory!) The book overall was a pretty slow read, and the main thing that kept me going was the knowledge that there was a big twist later on, which I didn't necessarily see coming, but I didn't find to be that shocking either. The last 50 pages were the only ones that actually had me hooked, and I wish the entirety of the book had been more gripping, but I still thought it was pretty enjoyable, and I'm excited to talk about it at the end of the month! ...more \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0644\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0631

Rattattattt\" The story is like getting into this 'routine' Train, not express, just normal. Looking into the window, if you're having free time, free imagination you'll see too much. Rachel , Anna , Megan \"aka: Jess\" and Tom , Scott \"aka; Jason\" All have their Obsession, weakness, feeling empty...empty life.. Feeling unsuccessful, missing something.. worried about something.. All have their share of fear.. And most of All, Rachel. Drunk, messy, ranty and obsessed Rachel. with her poor empty life full of failure. Nosy Rachel, with her wild imagination that makes her get into what's not her business. And she's the narrating for 75% of the story, so you can see how it must be, a 200 pages expanded into 316 by drinking too much. But then, at a point the Train start getting speed, and a disappearance makes life harder to everyone.. Everyone become a Suspect. Most of all, again , Rachel. Drunk Rachel who doesn't remember a thing... just fear.. I really loved though it was a bit slow, too much pages where nothing big happens but \"Rattattattt Rattattattt Rattattattt\" I felt sleepy sometimes...as the tune of Train just going and going and going.. AND yet sometimes it jolt..sometimes it's really tense ... very thrilling. And most of all, I can't just ignore that I LOVED the characters.. It has a way getting into your mind. Specially , again, Rachel. And you can see a resemble of Rachel in every character. and it's very realistic. Anna, Megan , Scott did sneak into their partners' emails and messages. Just like Rachel did. Megan, Anna did feel the empty of their life, though they got everything.. Just like Rachel..who didn't got but a really nice friend 'Cathy' -God she's really an Angel- Megan, Anna even Tom has mistakes, and they worried it'll haunt them again..just like Rachel. and in the crime that happened , everyone is a suspect. \"Rattattattt Rattattattt Rattattattt\" Finally; why 3.5 \"raised to 4\" Rating? It's not the ending, it's Shocking YES but you can guess it by the final third of the novel. (view spoiler) [\"Tom's a good Liar\" come on...then Rachel remember what he kept tell her. (hide spoiler) ] and the slowness or \"monotonous\" dairy of Rachel that felt sometimes as the sound of the train on tracks. The very crafty drawing of the characters Specially Rachel , is the most that made me feel sorry for her, even connected to her. that's what made me change the rate at last.. (view spoiler) [Despite the cheesy ending, how she confronting the killer, who treated her badly, with the wife who wish she disappear off her world forever. and Tata, here she is, alone, with no weapon, before calling cops, go to say she knows everything.. come on. (hide spoiler) ] So judging by the way I felt toward the characters.. I feel the writing was really good despite any flows I felt. \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a ------ \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638

But my better angels lost again, defeated by drink, by the person I am when I drink. Drunk Rachel sees no consequences, she is either excessively expansive and optimistic or wrapped up in hate. She has no past, no future. She exists purely in the moment. Drunk Rachel...lies.\u201d There are certainly worse ways to spend your day than riding an S stock train into London. Rachel rides the train into London every day to keep up the pretense that she has a job. The truth is she lost her job months ago when she showed up to work inebriated, not just buzzed or mildly intoxicated, but sloppy drunk. She can\u2019t exactly put her finger on when she first started to drink too much. It was around the time when she was trying to get pregnant with her now ex-husband Tom. He impregnated his mistress instead. \u201dThe dagger in my heart twists, round and round and round.\u201d Anna, slender little Anna, is now living in her house with her husband with a child that should have been hers. Rachel used to be attractive, curvy, and pretty, but now the curves have lost their buoyancy, and her face has become puffy. She is melting down into someone unrecognizable. The pain that used to be internalized is now manifesting itself into a grotesque mask. She drinks to escape. \u201dWhen I drink, I hardly sleep at all. I pass out cold for an hour or two, then I wake, sick with fear, sick with myself. If I have a day when I don\u2019t drink, that night I fall into the heaviest of slumbers, a deep unconsciousness, and in the morning I cannot wake properly, I cannot shake sleep, it stays with me for hours, sometimes for days.\u201d Drinking doesn\u2019t work, not drinking is worse. Sometimes she blacks out. The problem with THAT is she loses so much control over what she does or what she remembers. When she blacks out she has to believe what others tell her. This is when she writes painfully embarrassing emails to her ex-husband. This is when she is capable of doing something that she would never consider doing sober. The train takes Rachel by her old life every day. The subdivision with the beautiful house that she thought would be hers forever is part of her daily view. She can look right into the backyards of the homes, and there she starts to notice a couple, a perfect couple who seem to love each other. She projects a life onto them, even giving them names, and starts to look forward to any glimpse of them that will allow her to add to the fairy tale narrative that she has been assembling about them on her daily rides into work. Then one day she sees something that brings the whole house of cards tumbling down. We can look at other people and think their lives are wonderful. They must be leading so much more successful and meaningful lives than we do. The problem of course is that we know everything about our lives. Every failure is duly noted on a spooling list. Our successes are tempered by our own feelings of inadequacies. Every debilitating slight to our self-esteem etches away at the foundation of our ability to see beyond the things that have went wrong. What we have to remind ourselves of is that, though people may seem to be leading perfect lives, everybody has problems. Don\u2019t fool yourself, and don\u2019t let them fool you either. We are all doomed to be disappointed, to falter, to make mistakes, and sometimes destroy ourselves. Scott and Megan, as it turns out, are no different. Her mythical couple have names as it turns out, not the ones she chose for them. When Megan disappears Rachel realizes that she saw something. The problem is she is an irresponsible drunk. This book is certainly an ode to one of my favorite films Rear Window . (For those youngsters out there, you might be more familiar with the film Disturbia .) Jimmy Stewart is incapacitated with a broken leg, but Rachel may actually be more incapacitated by her drinking. Rachel is the definition of an unreliable narrator. I didn\u2019t what to believe her, not necessarily because I felt she was lying, but because she was so wasted most of the time that even her version of sober might be my version of being buzzed. The characters in this book are not very endearing. As we learn more about them we find less and less to like about them. Be warned about these characters if you are a reader that must like the people you read about. The plot certainly reminded me of an Agatha Christie. I often found myself munching down on a red herring served on a Ritz Cracker and washed down with a decent Merlot. I didn\u2019t enjoy this book as much as I did the modern noir novels of Peter Swanson , but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be forgetting this book any time soon. If that proves to be the case, I might even need to bump it one star. There is talk of Emily Blunt starring in the upcoming movie which could lend the project some extra attention. This book, with this plot, should translate well to screen. Don\u2019t feel guilty if you decide to wait for the movie. Paula Hawkins has laid out a script that shouldn\u2019t need much tucking or trimming for the big screen.

Comparing this book to Hitchcock is just laughable. Okay, okay, it does start out with intrigue, as the girl, Rachel, sits on the train day after day, and obsessively peeks at a house where she can see a man and a woman moving around. She gives them names and imagines a perfect life and perfect marriage for them. This voyeurism is pretty cool. A great beginning. But I wish Rachel had stayed on the train.

She gives them names and imagines a perfect life and perfect marriage for them. This voyeurism is pretty cool. A great beginning. But I wish Rachel had stayed on the train. In fact, I wish the train had been the setting for the whole book and that the plot had turned into something twisty about mysterious commuters. Instead (and in my mind, tragically), Rachel gets off the train. And then the story is all about Rachel getting drunk, Rachel calling her ex while drunk, Rachel trying to remember things that happened while drunk, Rachel pissing off her roommate while drunk, and Rachel being ashamed about being drunk. And around and around. Yes, this gets really boring. We spend a lot of time inside Rachel\u2019s head, and though this works in many books, it\u2019s tedious here. I will say that despite this, the first-person voice drew me in. Most of the book is Rachel\u2019s voice, though two other women sometimes tell their stories. All three voices are articulate and make you feel all chummy with the narrator. The language has a good flow to it, and the book is easy to read and has a really nice tone. On the flip side, all three women speak in the exact same way; their voices are interchangeable. This makes them seem less like real characters; I become aware that there is just one person and that\u2019s the author. Not being able to create different personalities with their own voices is a common weakness in authors, especially new ones, but that doesn\u2019t make it less annoying. It seems amateurish. The plot is about a woman who goes missing. Rachel the drunken mess is a busybody who sticks her nose in and tries to find out what happened. The cast of characters includes her ex, his new wife, a therapist, and the fantasy couple Rachel saw from the train. The characters are well drawn but their behaviors don\u2019t tell us enough to let us figure out whodunit. There just aren\u2019t enough clues, which is always a letdown. I want to guess, and I want to have a chance of getting it right. The mystery is suddenly solved at the very end--all the suspense is saved up for those final 70 or so pages. The reveal is satisfying, and for me is a surprise, but the read is definitely uneven. The final scenes are well-written and action-packed, but the majority of the book is sort of slow and repetitive. Oh, and not only was the book not like Hitchcock, it most definitely was not like Gone Girl, a truly spectacular psychological thriller. Once again, I\u2019m left thinking, huh? Are you kidding me? How come I missed the train to Gushland? Rachel should have stayed on the damn train and I might have ended up in the same town as everyone else. Instead, as I said, Mediocre-ville for me. ...more El hijo idiota de Gone Girl . Una decepci\u00f3n enorme.

Enter Megan, who's story begins one year before Rachael's. I must confess, I got a little confused with the dates interspersed throughout the story, but realized the author was using them cleverly. Meagan's story seems to move quickly forward, while Rachael's, very slowly. I thought they were a perfect analogy for two trains on different tracks, bound to converge at some point along the way. And converge they do. Megan goes missing on a day Rachael has drank herself into a black out. What has happened to Megan and what does her story have to do with not only Rachael herself, but also her fantasy story of the perfect couple?

In my personal opinion, this book passes the mystery-thriller-suspense-crime criteria with flying colors! What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter. It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader\u2019s empathy. Of the three POV\u2019s, I was most glued to that of Rachel\u2019s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot.

This exception, I think is what makes this book more realistic and well darker and more sinister. It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time.
