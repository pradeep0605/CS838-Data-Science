The story, the characters, the world, the magic system--I loved it all! It was a wonderful first book in a series--satisfying on its own, yet there's still plenty to explore in future books (which I will definitely be reading soon!) Really, the only somewhat negative thing I have to say is regarding all the hype. While I definitely think the praise is deserved, it did leave me with very very high expectations. Expectations that were met, but because I was anticipating awesomeness, it didn't blow me away as much as it could have. But again, this is a very minor gripe, and more about my reading experience than the actual book itself. I'll talk about the book more in a video soon, but for now I'll just say again, I LOVED IT. The story was beautifully constructed, the world was rich and believable, and the characters were likable and well developed. I can't wait to continue the series and see where it goes next! ...more Sometimes, I revisit a book I had loved ages ago, only to tell myself \"What the actual fuck was I thinking?!

Oh young Khanh, you were so dumb :(\" Thankfully, this was absolutely NOT the case for this book. I appreciated it much more the second time around. It could be that it just took time for me to appreciate the book. Or maybe it just glows in comparison to all the crap I had been reading (2.5 average rating last year, baby!). Either way, I ain't complaining! First, the bad, because I'm that sort of person. Sanderson is a good writer, not a great one. The world he has built is magical, his words are not. Sanderson's writing is simple, readable. Perhaps too simple. I appreciate the fact that there is no purple prose, but sometimes, a story is woven through the magic of words, and Sanderson's writing is simply too plain for me. On the other hand, damn, he's verbose. This is a huge-ass book, people. I mean, I get it. The book is tremendously grand in scope, the story is complex, and will only get more complicated as the series wears on, but I find myself wearying of reading , which is a sad thing for any reader to realize. Now, the good. First, LOW ON ROMANCE, BITCHES! CAN I GET A FUCK, YEAH? Sanderson, I feel, is so respectful to his female characters. They are strong, resourceful, independent. They can get by without a man. The women in his book have to earn their stripes. There's no getting by on beauty and flirtation here. Wit and cunning is a much safer bet than the size of a female character's tits. The world building is tremendous. The magic of Allomancy is just so fucking awesome, and so well-described. World building, the myth and magic surrounding any high fantasy is so crucial, and Sanderson did a tremendous job. Yes, it's a long-ass book, and the writing isn't as spectacular as some (Guy Gavriel Kay), but on the other hand, this book is eminently readable, with a limited amount of meandering (unlike Guy Gavriel Kay). ...more WOAH. That was a crazy epic adventure full of fantastic characters and action packed madness! It definitely lived up to all the hype for me. :) I can't remember being this violently conflicted about a book in quite some time. There are some areas where it's just so well done, with the author absolutely nailing it, and then others where I found myself grinding my teeth in frustration. I'm going to abandon my usual practice of writing short, pithy reviews and just drunkenly ramble on a few things here. (Still no spoilers, though.) That OK with y'all? Language. About two and a half chapters into this book, I found myself asking, \"Why does t I can't remember being this violently conflicted about a book in quite some time. There are some areas where it's just so well done, with the author absolutely nailing it, and then others where I found myself grinding my teeth in frustration. I'm going to abandon my usual practice of writing short, pithy reviews and just drunkenly ramble on a few things here. (Still no spoilers, though.) That OK with y'all? Language. About two and a half chapters into this book, I found myself asking, \"Why does this feel like a kids' fantasy book?\" It wasn't the subject material or the plot, both of which were clearly more sophisticated than Harry Potter and his ilk. While I would feel perfectly comfortable having a 12-year old read this PG13-violent and utterly sexless book, I don't feel as though it's necessarily written for tweens. Finally it occurred to me: it's the language . This book is one of the most simply written books I've ever read, using only the most basic vocabulary. That isn't a bad thing, as I'd rather read something direct and simple than something flowery and overwritten, but Sanderson's language is so simple here that it's almost as if he's drawing with the Crayola 16-set when other authors have the big 64. (One notable exception: having apparently become recently enamored of the word, he uses maladroitly at least three times. Maybe he was jamming some Weezer while he wrote.) I haven't read any of his other works (yet; Mistborn #2 is on deck), but I have to assume this simplicity is by conscious choice, and it's an interesting choice at that. I'm just not sure yet how I feel about it. One language choice that I am sure how I feel about is Sanderson's decision to have his characters speak good old American English. The narration is similarly plainspoken, with a fair amount of American slang thrown in, rather than the twee, faux-Elizabethan style of a lot of fantasy authors. I like the approach. One of the most time-honored fantasy tropes is having all the characters thee and thou each other, with a few ne'er did yon stars of Yomama glimmer so resplendently, my suzerain for good measure. And I can handle that stuff, having been weaned on Tolkien and everything that came after, but I found Sanderson's decision to move away from that convention refreshing. I interpreted it as Sanderson saying, \"The unspoken assumption here is that this book has been translated from whatever languages they speak on this made-up world, so why translate it to anything other than what is most understandable and comfortable for you to read? To couch this story in funky language is to insult your imagination by implying that you need that in order to realize you're reading a fantasy novel.\" Setting and Plot. The setting is a typical high fantasy world - feudal-style nobility and peasantry; shadowy, powerful priesthood; mysterious evil lord, etc. - with some odd, almost steampunk flourishes thrown in. There are wristwatches. Men's formal wear is described as something more like Victorian coat and tails than medieval garb. Magic in this world is fueled by elemental and alloyed metals, which are described rather exactly, using percentages. It's a unique and interesting blend. The basic plot is about as stock as it gets. If you're familiar with the Star Wars films, the Harry Potter or Percy Jackson books, Eragon , the Dragonriders of Pern trilogy, Dune , Ender's Game , or any one of about a million other works, please play along: Dear [kid with weird name] , I know you are only a [farmer / orphan / urchin / child of a minor noble] , and this will be hard for you to accept, but you [have Great Powers / are the Chosen One / insert name of funky power here] . You are the only one who can [save the world / save the universe / defeat the Empire / restore order to the Force / kill the Big Boss] . Luckily, even though you just learned your destiny fifteen minutes ago, you will make up for lost time by quickly becoming better than anyone in the history of ever at [Quidditch / dragon riding / sandworm riding / Allomancy] . Any questions? Needless to say, the book's plot could have been a ticket to Hack City, but it really isn't. Vin's growth and development are handled well. Exposition. This is a fantasy book for the video game generation. By that, I mean that the book follows the general path of a first person RPG: 1) Introduction to the world and the main characters 2) A few early levels whose only apparent purpose is to teach the player how to use the buttons 3) Quests of increasing difficulty, with progressive reveals of the Big Plot 4) Fight with the Main Boss, including the inevitable twist 5) Denouement and teaser for the next installment. Not that that's a bad thing! But I was really surprised at the way Allomancy (the main \"magic\" in this world) was laid out. In the two towering fantasy/sci-fi works of the 20th century ( The Lord of the Rings and Dune ), the supernatural elements of the story operated behind a sort of curtain or screen. The One Ring in LotR and the spice Melange in Dune both held great, mysterious powers, but the specific effects and extent of those powers were seen only in fits and flashes, and never understood completely by the characters or the reader. In contrast, fairly early in this book, Kelsier takes Vin on a practice run where he explains how her powers work and what their advantages and limitations are, using plain language and real-world physics, and lets her fly and mess around and just generally exult in her magic. It left me, the reader, as well as Vin the character, feeling that even if we didn't understand this magic perfectly right now, we might at some point in the future, which was a very different feel. OK, after enough rambling about things I feel ambivalently about, let's wrap up with one big win and one big fail: WIN: <---A>Brandon Sanderson</---A> can write the hell out of an action scene. (And since the final quarter of this book is pretty much all action, playing directly into Sanderson's strengths, it kicks all kinds of ass.) The fights in this book are gut-wrenching without being overly gory, and the chases and sneaks are heart-stopping as well. Perfect combination of pace and detail. Amazing. Possibly the best I've ever read from an author in this genre, and if he's able to do that so effortlessly, so early in his career, it gives me hope that he can fix... FAIL: ...the dialogue. In spite of being favorably disposed due to the use of informal American English, I eventually found the dialogue here really clunky. Everyone is too wordy. Everyone says one sentence too many. Over and over again, I found myself going, \"Real people don't talk like this\" and especially, \"Real people who are supposed to be close friends don't talk anything like this to each other.\" Seriously, think of how you talk to your best friends in private, then compare it to this book. In addition, there was always that odd feeling of unneeded exposition, as if the characters were talking half to each other and half to the reader. It was unfortunate, especially in contrast to how slick and fast-moving and just plain awesome a lot of the other writing was. All in all, this was a fun, kinetic read...with a few holes in it. It builds, it explodes, and the ending is really good. If half-stars were allowed, this would have been a 3 1/2. Good stuff. Also, here are my (spoiler-free, suitable as previews) reviews of the second and third books in the series, if you enjoyed this one! ...more MISTBORN WAS SO GOOD GAHH HERE'S MY BOOKTALK: http://youtu.be/S9kgwYQ6MPs I'M NOT OKAY I'M STILL CRYING.

But then I thought, no, no, this CANNOT be, he wouldn't do this, and I went back through all my meticulously collected clues and hints and found an explanation. A perfectly. Reasonable. Explanation. An explanation that made sense. An explanation that would keep my heart in one piece instead of the shattered, brittle thing it has since become. An explanation . . . I am forced to conclude . . . you deliberately planted . . . to foster FALSE HOPE. YOU are the Deepness, Mr. Sanderson. YOU are that which will destroy the world. And YOU will do it GLEEFULLY. I hate you most of all. I can't write the review that I want to . . . I can't talk about Sanderson's brilliance as he cultivated my doubt, and how that doubt made the loss so much worse: (view spoiler) [I DENIED HIM. MORE than three times. *changes name to Paul* *runs away to live like hermit in wilderness* *is generally miserable* (hide spoiler) ] Which is exactly what he intended. It was so masterfully done, it couldn't be an accident. Why does your manipulation make me admire you so? Probably b/c (thanks to you) I'm a shadow of myself. <------oh, look at that. You probably PLANNED THAT, TOO. The world of the Mistborn is not a pleasant place. There's always a downtrodden servant class (skaa)\u00a0in a Sanderson series, but this world's version is particularly bleak. Ash falls like rain from the sky, supplying the skaa with\u00a0a never-ending, yet thankless\u00a0workload. They're beaten regularly, often resulting in their deaths. A pretty daughter is a curse\u00a0rather than a blessing, b/c\u00a0not only will\u00a0the Master feel obliged to have his way with her, but when he gets bored, she'll be killed. Halfbreeds are to be avoided, you see. The nobility is sometimes blessed with magic. Magic which passes genetically to offspring, and we can't allow\u00a0the peasants to gain that kind of\u00a0power, can we? *twirls mustache* Enter Kelsier. *fireworks* In the city where corruption among the nobility\u00a0chokes the air almost as much as the ashfall, some skaa thumb their noses at the system. They form street gangs\u00a0and\u00a0steal\u00a0whatever they can from those who would enslave them, existing in a cutthroat world by embracing a cutthroat\u00a0mentality. Most of the gangs are comprised of ordinary skaa, but a few are different, more organized crews than low-level thieves\u00a0. . . They take bigger jobs, they are the royals of the petty crooks, they are the Mistings. And in a few\u00a0extremely rare cases, they are the Mistborn. Not every halfbreed life is snuffed out before it can begin . . . And Kelsier is the greatest of them all. Among the common criminals he\u00a0is legend: \u201cThat\u2019s where he got those scars, you know,\u201d Disten said. \u201cThe ones on his arms. He got them at the Pits, from the rocks on a sheer wall he had to climb to escape.\u201d Harmon snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s not how he got them. He killed an Inquisitor while escaping\u2014that\u2019s where he got the scars.\u201d \u201cI heard he got them fighting one of the monsters that guard the Pits,\u201d Ulef said. \u201cHe reached into its mouth and strangled it from the inside . The teeth scraped his arms.\u201d Disten frowned. \u201cHow do you strangle someone from the inside?\" But Kelsier was betrayed, and when he finally escaped the pits that claimed his wife, he was determined to be more than a crew leader. More than a thorn in the Lord Ruler's thigh or a bramble in his path. And when you think about it, as far as planning goes, there's not much difference between organizing a chancey heist and plotting to overthrow a corrupt ruler who thinks himself a god . . . One might even suggest that Kelsier is the perfect man to do it . . . Beyond his suitability for the task, there's something immensely likable about the image of this noble Fagin flipping a coin he keeps to anchor his Allomancy, the ability to metabolize and manipulate metals. And here's the thing about Sanderson: the man's a genius. Now that I've familiarized myself with him, I don't think I'll ever be able to stop reading his books. Even if I'm not thrilled about the execution, there is always incredible potential in his ideas. Take the concept for this series: what would happen if the hero meant to save the world . . . failed? SO. We have servant class con men with flash + an immortal tyrant = Revolution! We have a world in ruin one thousand years after the hero of prophecy failed to save it. Add to that Sanderson's trademark misdirection, and, well . . . Despite my brokenness in the aftermath, how could I not read it? How can you not? Highly recommended, but only with LOTS of cake (or something stronger) to drown your agony. PS - this changes nothing. I still hate all of you. Pre-review: Also, I HATE ALL OF YOU.

I read this book without knowing anything and I suggest others do the same! (Though, I did look at some fan art and HOLY CRAP it looks so cool omg. But beware of spoilers.) The World Building/Magic System This book somehow managed to have the most extensive world building and the most creative magic system I've ever read about WHILE keeping me totally invested AND not bored the entire time. Don't get me wrong... there are slower parts and there is A LOT to this world - but Sanderson introduced it in such a way that it only made me feel for the characters the more as he revealed the world. My gosh, it is so well done and it felt real. I'll admit, I'm a bit of a lazy reader. I was seriously worried I would be confused the entire time because there is a lot to remember about the magic BUT Sanderson does a great job of reminding you what every magical skill/burning metal does each time he brings it up. So please, don't feel overwhelmed as you start going through this. As long as you get the general idea, you'll be totally fine. The Characters (get ready for some ridiculous fangirling) Good gravy. I freaking adored the ENTIRE CAST. Vin is just previous. I was SO connected to her the entire time - I just adore her so much. She's realistic. No special snowflakes here. Kelsier is a flipping genius and I have no words because just... ugh. Also his relationship with Vin was so touching. Okay I'm getting emotional. ELEND. YASSS ugh. He was adorbs. He and Vin were just... I just.... ugh. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. (My only complaint might be I wished we had spent more time with them alone - developing their relationship.) BUT I knew about him before I started the series so I was just dying for him and Vin to meet... and OMG his intro is the BEST EVER. Sazed. Holy frick man you are a badass. <---C>Marsh</---C>? Omigosh. NO WORDS. Don't get me started on the genius villainous tactics Sanderson used with the Lord Ruler. You guys, these characters feel so real that its scary. Sanderson is a master. THE PLOT Okay, so I've mentioned it before. It is kinda slow to start - but not a bad slow. There is the perfect amount of development, in my opinion. This is just a long book - and it needs to be with the amount of connection Sanderson is trying to draw. Just go into this expecting a high fantasy - it is NOT a light read. I don't want to say much about the plot other than it is just brilliant. One things pick up (and they do) - its pretty much non stop until the end. There are some crazy plot twists and I was pretty much freaking out the entire last third of this book. Honestly this first book could be a stand alone- I did not expect so many things to be resolved in this.. but it was SUCH a pleasant surprise. I'm still sitting here with my jaw open over the ending. This is one of the best endings I've ever read. Overall So, all this to say- this was an easy five stars. Literal perfection if you're into high fantasy. The writing was perfection. Everything was so detailed and real. WHY HAS THIS NOT BEEN MADE INTO A MOVIE.

And now for the rest of you - all the above is true. For the few days I was reading it, this book did its level best to take over my life. It was addicting. I craved it like chocolate, and not being able to read was hard to deal with. I would expect nothing less from the man chosen to finish the Wheel of Time, or from a contributor to Writing Excuses, the podcast that got me into podcasts. I went into Mistborn ready to be impressed, but that's not what happened. I wasn't impressed. I was wowed. Blown away. Astounded. Engrossed. Shocked. Thrilled. And filled with a sense of loss when it was over. This is not a good book, my friends. This is a great book. This is what fantasy needs. As far as the genre is concerned, this book - this series - this author - is the Hero of Ages. Thank goodness for Brandon Sanderson. Thank goodness for a writer with such a depth of imagination; for the wildly creative systems of magic he creates; for his vivid and haunting settings; for his masterful plotting and artful twists which are, always, \"surprising but inevitable\". Thank goodness for a male writer who makes his female main character strong, but not in a masculine way. Vin is seriously amazing. So is the rest of the cast - my one objection is that there aren't any other women in significant roles, but maybe that'll change in later books. And the writing! I know from Writing Excuses that Sanderson has never wanted to be anything but an author, and that he spent years working as a hotel clerk so he had time to write, and that he had completed numerous novels before he managed to sell one. It shows. The language is almost entirely flowing and clear, suffering only occasionally from an over-use of commas. (One after every 'but' is a bit much.) More authors should learn to write like this. More authors should practice writing the way he has. Normally I find more to say about books I like, but this time I'm too impressed. Sanderson has amazed me beyond anything I expected. I can't wait to read The Well Of Ascension. ...more This is an epic fantasy series and <+++>The Final Empire</+++> , the first book in the trilogy is, in itself, epic.

If anything, Brandon Sanderson certainly knows how to write alarmingly cool books. Awesome magic system Alomancy allows the wielder to burn metals, inside themselves, enhancing their physical abilities such as strength and their senses. It also allows them to push and pull certain metals, which means they can fire bullets with a thought. Some can mask the power of others and some can detect the power. These are called Mistings, but each type has a specific name and there are eight varieties. Mistings have but one metal they can burn granting them a specific ability associated with the metal but, a Mistborn can burn all of them. These powers are thrown into a colourless world, ruled by a tyrannical Lord, and combine to create a plot full of revolution and injustice. The thieves which seem to be a group of pompous swindlers are headed by an individual with remarkable depth and heroism: Kelisar. Kelisar is a full Mistborn who takes under his wing Vin who he instantly recognises as a fellow Mistborn. Ok so some of this may seem confusing at first but there is a handy explanation at the back of the book labelling each misting and their respective power which becomes helpful to the reader though it does begin to sink in eventually. Trust me when I say that this system is only as complex as it needs to be. Lots of character development This is where the exceptional character develop begins. Vin grows from an unconfident street urchin to Kelisar\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and eventually becomes one of the leaders of the rebellion against the Lord Ruler. We, as the reader, watch her grow as she takes her first steps into her new reality as her powers begin to strengthen and perhaps may even one day outshine Kelisar\u2019s. I love to see characters grow across a novel, and Vin certainly does that. Moreover, the side characters of the novel also develop as their origins and depths of their powers are revealed. \u201cThere's always another secret.' -Kelsier\u201d The plot of this may sound very generic at first glance, but I assure it most certainly isn\u2019t. At the end of this novel Sanderson quite literally terns everything around, and you learn how the world and the reader has been deceived.

His name shall be Discord, yet they shall love him for it.\" A thousand years ago, a young and noble hero arose from rural obscurity into being hailed by Terris priests as the prophesised Hero of Ages. The nations and armies of the world were united beneath his banner in an effort to challenge the Deepness, the mysterious force of darkness threatening to engulf the world. All hope was placed upon a final, daring strike towards the fabled Well of Ascension. But the dreams and hopes of the world were crushed, and the hero\u2019s great mission failed spectacularly. Since then, the entire world has been ruled by the iron fist of the Lord Ruler and his Final Empire. Those few who supported him from the beginning became the Imperial noble families, their existence filled with opulence and extravagance. Everyone else became the skaa , slaves forced to work until they die. Every attempted rebellion has failed, and the oppressive regime grows stronger and stronger with each passing day. But finally, a new kind of rebellion is being planned. One of subterfuge and infiltration. Of the ultimate heist. Of criminal masterminds and allomancers, those able to use the magic of the metals\u2026 Characters \u201dWherever she is, she tries to be as small and unnoticeable as possible. So tense. Vin didn\u2019t sit, she crouched. She didn\u2019t walk, she prowled. Even when she was sitting in the open, she seemed to be trying to hide.\u201d The main protagonist of the book is Vin, a street urchin who has never known neither friendship nor trust. Growing up with a delirious mother and an abusive brother, she has survived on the ash-filled streets only though a combination of luck and cunning. Vin\u2019s point of view is a rather unusual one in the fantasy genre, and Vin herself is an unlikely heroine. In the beginning, she always tries to make herself seem as small and inconspicuous as possible and thinks everyone else will eventually betray her. A member of a thieving crew, Vin is a part of the dangerous criminal underworld of the empire, where no one can be trusted and where petty greed is everyone\u2019s only motivation. But all that changes when one day she meets Kelsier\u2026 \u201dThat man isn\u2019t human. He might not be a mistwraith, but he\u2019s not skaa either. I\u2019ve heard of him doing things. Things like only they can do. The ones that come out at night.\u201d Kelsier is a legend in the underworld. Once the greatest crewleader in the capital of Luthadel, a man who could pull off any heist, he was eventually caught by the Lord Ruler himself and sent to the Pits of Hathsin, a definite death sentence. But as the only one ever to do so, Kelsier escaped from the Pits, earning the name \u2018the Survivor of Hathsin\u2019, and the idolising reverence of the skaa. The story begins when Kelsier returns to Luthadel after all these years, with a grand new plan and a crew of criminal masterminds to execute it. The characters definitely make up one of the greatest strengths of this book. During the course of the book, Kelsier himself became, in my eyes, one of the greatest fantasy characters ever. The same goes for the mysterious and dark Lord Ruler. But it seems like every single character is a significant part of the story. They\u2019re all brilliantly constructed, and they\u2019re all important. A seemingly minor character in one chapter can suddenly turn out to be a major player in another. Almost everyone has a dark and painful past, and everyone has a part to play. Setting \u201dIt\u2019s called a flower.\u201d Kelsier said. \u201cThey used to grow on plants before the Ascension. Descriptions of them appear in the old poems and stories \u2013 things that only Keepers and rebel sages know about anymore. Apparently, these plants were beautiful, and they had a pleasant smell.\u201d The Final Empire is in more than one way a dystopian world. There are no green things growing. There are no flowers and no beautiful nature. Frequent volcanic eruptions cover the world in rains of ashes, causing the world to turn dark and grey. And the nights belong to the mists, making people fearful of going outside after dark. For the mistwraiths are roaming everywhere. The political aspect and the society of the Final Empire is reminiscent of an even more extreme version of France just prior to the revolution. The common folk are oppressed and treated as slaves by the nobility, who spend their time going to balls and festivities in their illustrious keeps. The regime rules with religious legitimacy, and in the beginning only the more privileged among the lowborn people speak of defiance and rebellion. Another exceedingly interesting part of the setting is the book\u2019s magic system. Allomancy is the power to control different metals, and to control everything else through the use of different metals. The powers themselves are reminiscent of the Force powers of the Jedi, but the source of the power, swallowing and \u201cburning\u201d metals inside one\u2019s body, is completely new where magic systems go, and provides a rather unique touch to this setting. Personal opinion \u201dThere is always another secret.\u201d That one line seems to be the trademark of this book. For every bit of information being revealed to a character or to the reader, for every plan being set in motion, there is always another secret. When you think you\u2019ve got it all sorted out, when the story is going towards a conclusion, yet more of those secrets are revealed. And even when the book ends, there are still secrets that have yet to be revealed. Mistborn: The Final Empire is certainly one of the best books I have read this year, and I would not be exaggerating if I should call it one of the best fantasy books of this century. Like any other book, it had its downsides, but those were few and insignificant enough to not have any impact on my opinion of the book as a whole. Sanderson\u2019s writing is particularly impressive. Throughout the entirety of the book, he managed to fill me with all kinds of different emotions. He made me furious, he made me laugh and he surprised me. The book contains tons of twists and turns of the plot, most of which are predictable, but in such a way that they add to the overall quality of the book instead of making it boring. And of course, certain events and revelations are not predictable at all, especially nearing the end of the story. This is, for all intents and purposes, a four-star book. So you might wonder why I chose to give it five. And the reason for that is quite simply that I have a tendency of giving five-star ratings to books containing a special scene or detail that I consider to be\u2026 well, perfect is as good a word as any (I am apparently easily influenced that way). This book actually had two of those. But there is always another secret, and this must remain secret from those of you who have yet to read this. But you should know that these details alone are more than enough to make the book worth reading. (view spoiler) [The first one of those small details was the way each chapter began with a paragraph from the famous logbook. That insight into the mind of the Hero of Ages, the tale of his journey to the Well of Ascension and his thoughts about the old world in general, was just extraordinary. The way it was written, as a small taste of something better in a world consumed by evil, added something more to the main story that it could not have managed on its own. The second detail was the letter Kelsier left behind for Vin to read. When the reader is following the desperation of the remaining crewmember and is split between anger and grief after Kelsier\u2019s brutal death, this letter arrives with lines like \u201cPlease don't be angry at me for abandoning you.\u201d and \u201cFarewell. I'll tell Mare about you. She always wanted a daughter.\" The scene where she read that was just exceptionally moving for me. (hide spoiler) ] So, in the end, the only thing left to say is that this was something truly extraordinary. Mr. Sanderson himself has repeatedly stated that he has always wanted to avoid following in the footsteps of the fantasy authors that came before him and instead to create something new, and that is certainly an ambition that has been fulfilled with this book. There are, of course, some fantasy tropes and some character archetypes being used here, but overall this is something different entirely. I would not hesitate to recommend Mistborn to absolutely everyone. And \u2018recommend\u2019 here roughly translates to \u2018hit people in the head with this book until they finally agree to read it\u2019. And yes, Sanderson certainly has got himself a new fan. ...more You know, when a book leaves you feeling dead inside? No?

I understand there are other unholy things that are going to come to life, and crazy shit is going to go down but i kind of don't care. If it were the last book i would've been more than fine with the ending but IT'S NOT! IT's only the beginning. Why would Brandon Sanderson do this to us? Why??! I had this whole review planned out, all my neatly written notes, highlighted quotes i was going to use. But 50 pages before the book ended i ripped and threw them in the garbage. I'm having Rose and Jack moment right now, except I WON'T LET GO! I'll sit on that frozen water for the rest of my life and i will never let go!

I have been neglecting this series (and author) for far too long, and after I read that prologue I was fiending for the actual story. Is fiending a word? I think it's slang. Now I'm answering my own questions in a review. Whatever, I like fiending and I'm keeping it! This story has two very predominate social classes in this book; The nobility and the slaves. The Lord Ruler is the \"God\" of this world, and his corrupt government is The Final Empire. The Final Empire is filled with \"Inquisitors\" which are men selected by The Lord Ruler and then remade into things that are more powerful and stronger than any normal man or woman. Plus, they have really creepy spikes going through their head, chest, and back. The Lord Ruler rents Skaa citizens out as slaves to the wealthy nobles, while the other prisoners are forced to work and die in his mines. The Lord Ruler is also very strict with the sexual reproduction of mixed classes/breeds, so most nobles will kill the Skaa women they've been intimate with shortly after. They are obviously being mistreated, and you soon find out that many are behind a rebellion that might actually stand a chance at doing something about this world's oppression. Oh, and the world is constantly raining ash (and mist at night), causing the world to be dark and rather lifeless. There is a frequent conversation about how the old world, before the Lord Ruler's rule, had actual flowers growing from upon the ground and on the fruits. The characters are in awe and disbelief over this. Nothing is green, everything is just grey. Brandon Sanderson's writing is simple and easy to understand, but you are thrown into a world with a very unique premise. I think he really paves his own path for fantasy, and stays away from regular fantasy tropes. I was a little overwhelmed by the allomantic skills until I was able to write most of them in my notes. What a unique concept though! Burning different elemental metals for different powers was so different, and I loved it. After you finished this book (I have the three ebook bind-up) they give you a neat little chart of the eight basic alloys and a little index of all the jobs. I was so sad I didn't know about this, or that it wasn't at the beginning! Each chapter begins with a paragraph that feels very significant, but a little out of place. I was so sure it was the main character's journal or diary at first, then I started thinking it was the Lord Ruler. It was such a wonderful little mystery! I can't applaud Brandon Sanderson enough. This minor detail was enough for me to not only want to continue on with this series, but to also branch out to some of his other works. This book is mostly centered on two nonconventional heroes; the first being Kelsier , who is the hero every world needs. He's selfless and always believes in doing the right thing. And not in the fake, over the top, eye-rolling way, but in an actual \"he's a good person\" way. He's a skaa, who is in charge of a thieving crew, but this heist (to overthrow the Lord Ruler) might be bigger than anyone expected. He is also famous in this world, for being the only person that has escaped the Lord Ruler's mines, the Pits of Hathsin. Kelsier might get a little discouraged throughout the book, but he never gives up. He shows what ultimate sacrifice truly is. He also proves to Vin that she won't always be abandoned. (view spoiler) [I was so fucking invested in Kelsier, his death completely broke me and my little black heart. Then the letter he left for Vin, \u201cFarewell. I'll tell Mare about you. She always wanted a daughter.\" Please, stop cutting onions, whoever you are. (hide spoiler) ] The next star of this book is Vin , who is one of the strongest female leads I've read about to date. She starts out as an abandoned little girl form that streets that somehow managed to survive, and then she meets Kelsier. Her growth was absolutely beautiful, and she eventually masters the \"I'm a badass who also likes to dress up\" role that Celaena in Throne of Glass fails so very hard at. There isn't much romance in this book, but I absolutely devoured the ball/party scenes with Vin and Eldon. I loved watching Vin develop from this scared and hurt child who just sat on the sidelines, into this brave and selfless girl who is becoming a strong woman. I liked and connected with Vin the entire book, but that very last line - it got to me. I started shedding all these tears, before I even realized how it made me feel. That one simple sentence was just so perfectly placed, and ended up being so powerful. \u201cAnd realized that was all she had ever really wanted.\u201d Vin and Kelsier are both mistborns that use all of the metals in the allomantic chart above. If you can only control one of the basic elements you are just a misting. Both are rare, but mistborns are incredibly rare, and both mostly come from high noble houses. These skills come in very handy in starting a rebellion, and we find out that some mistborns are more powerful than others from their bloodline. We also have mistwraiths, which end up playing a very substantial role among the rest. Besides Vin, my favorite character was Sazed. Sazed is sort of Vin's steward in this book. He helps get her ready for high society life, while teaching her proper etiquette. He is a Terrisman , who studies and memorizes religions from before the Lord Ruler, so he can one day teach the world all these awesome forgotten religions. Sazed also teaches us about a second magic system, Feruchemy. He was such a compelling character, who won me over so quickly! I feel like his character not only brought together all the puzzle pieces we were missing, but some of his lines like me in awe as well. \u201cBelief isn\u2019t simply a thing for fair times and bright days, I think. What is belief\u2014what is faith\u2014if you don\u2019t continue in it after failure?\u201d Since this is my first Brandon Sanderson book, I have no idea who Hoid is or his importance, but I'm guessing he's like a hidden Easter Egg. After I finished this book, I went to YouTube to listen to a couple discussion groups, and they were all freaking out about Chapter 19 and Hoid's appearance. In this chapter, Hoid gives some information to Kelsier that would be rather impressive for a common beggar to know. What I can piece together is that he is a world traveler that is from other Brandon Sanderson books, which doesn't really affect my reading experience, but I figured I'd add it to my review in case it has relevance for one of my followers. Plus, I love Easter Eggs in my books, video-games and movies, so kudos for Brandon Sanderson! The ending was so, so, so good. Everyone told me going into this series that they only get better, so I cannot wait to start the next, because this one surpassed all of my expectations (view spoiler) [I bet the deepness, that I think the Lord Ruler was keeping at bay with atium, and is now going to make a very deadly appearance (hide spoiler) ] . I can honestly say I'm fiending for The Well of Ascension . Look at that, full circle, boom! Also, my friend Markus brought up, in his review , how Allomancy is like the Force powers of the Jedi and he completely blew my mind. I haven't seen any of my other friends make this parallel, so I just had to link his review and gush over how freakin' perfect of an assessment that is.

Even when I thought I was on the inside and knew what was going on a new development would come about and I would realize that I like the characters in the book had been duped. It made each new reveal all the more enjoyable. There are some fascinating characters that are easy to love right away: Vin : The shy girl who has been abandoned and used by everyone she has ever known. I love broken characters that slowly become more than they thought they were capable of. Vin is easy to love and root for. She has always tried to be small and hide so I love her journey into becoming a member of a team and learning to trust in people. \u201cKelsier,\u201d Vin said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Sazed smiled. \u201cA very good man, Mistress. One of the best I\u2019ve known.\u201d Vin nodded slightly. \u201cA good man\u2026\u201d she said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever know one of those before.\u201d Kelsier : The reformed thief who wants to use his powers of deception and scamming for good. He has a crazy plan that seems totally impossible but with his charismatic charm he is able to convince a team of men to help him in his improbable task. He is so easy to like right away and I loved his role as a mentor to Vin. There are some other great characters. The team of Allomancers recruited to for the plan each have their own qwerks and bring something to the team. Breeze was one of my favorites as he is the comic relief and often sarcastic. He is a master manipulator of emotions and has a way of stating the obvious in a lighthearted manor. \u201cDon\u2019t look so solemn, my dear fellow.\u201d Breeze said. \u201cWhy, you\u2019ll probably never actually have to rule the city. Chances are, we\u2019ll all get caught and executed long before that happens.\u201d And there is also the loyal servant Sazed, who is a keeper of knowledge for his people and has a history that rivals anyone else on the team. His interactions with Vin are lovely as well as he helps her into her role within the story. I loved how he had so much knowledge of all kinds of religions and how he gave each one the same level of respect. It was an interesting concept that all were useful to the right person. \u201cThe right belief is like a good cloak, I think. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit, however, can suffocate.\u201d The magic system is complex and takes a while to set up. But much like attending Hogwarts you feel as though you could perform it if you were an Allomancer by the time you are finished with the story. I love that about Brandon Sanderson books I always feel like if I lived in this world I would fit in and know where my place was depending on the powers I was given. The foe is horrible and the atrocities great. The Lord ruler is an easy man to hate for all the suffering the Skaa have endured. The nobility are equally easy to dislike for their role in the abuses. I enjoyed the journey Vin took into this world to see the nobility through a noble woman\u2019s eyes and find that it is easy to get caught up in pageantry and forget why she joined Kelsier\u2019s crew in the first place. It is easy to get distracted by beautiful things and forget the horrors behind them. The girl in me was so happy there is a little romance in the story as well. After reading WoK first and not even having a kiss until 800 pages in it was nice to see the slight flirtations and bantering between Vin and her love interest. \u201cWomen are like\u2026.thunderstorms. They\u2019re beautiful to look at, and sometimes they\u2019re nice to listen to \u2013 but most of the time they\u2019re just plain inconvenient.\u201d I look forward to reading the rest of this series after that fantastic ending. There were moments I laughed, others I cried and more where I sat on the edge of my seat. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the stories in this world develop. ...more My name is Sarah and I am immune to the deadly virus that is Acute Sandersonitis .

Please make up your freaking mind \u2718 {insert collective screams of dismay and outrage here} I am very sorry (view spoiler) [well, not really, just pretending here. For the sake of appearances and all that crap (hide spoiler) ] but you don't write a supposedly ADULT book and fill it to the brim with FREAKING TEENAGE, JUVENILE NONSENSE (FTJN\u2122). Vin might-maybe-who-knows-there-are-miracle-sometimes become a pretty cool character one day, but right now she is nothing but a silly annoying teenager, with silly annoying immature teenage ramblings, silly annoying teenage behavior, and a silly annoying ridiculous immature teenage crush. Bloody hell. I eyerolled so much while reading all this silly crap I almost lost an eyeball . When you think of the life this silly girl has supposedly endured, she should behave like an 80 year old or something. But no, not Vin. She acts 14 at the best of times . Threaten all you want, my DLSFs\u2122, I am still not afraid . NOW . Instead of wasting his time on Silly Juvenile Vin here (view spoiler) [And the DLSFs\u2122 scream: (hide spoiler) ] , Mr S. should have focussed ALL his attention on Awesome-Amazing-Badass-Hot-Marry-Me-Your-Ass-Is-Mine-I-Want-To-Have-Your-Babies characters.

Add-on December 7 2014: I completed my first re-read of Mistborn today and I must say that it becomes a lot slower to read the second time when you know where everything is headed. You notice the wordiness of the prose, the clunky dialogue and the fact that there are quite a few spots where it feels overly dramatised rather than necessarily natural. Yet for all of that Brandon Sanderson is a fine storyteller - not necessarily as great a writer at first but he gets a lot better in his later books Add-on December 7 2014: I completed my first re-read of Mistborn today and I must say that it becomes a lot slower to read the second time when you know where everything is headed.

Yet for all of that Brandon Sanderson is a fine storyteller - not necessarily as great a writer at first but he gets a lot better in his later books and isn't the worst I've ever seen. I want to apologise for being rather absent on here to anyone who is bothering to read this review again or for the first time. I love books, but I love people more and there are some particular people I'm choosing to spend my time with and love. This means I don't have quite the same time for my online presence as before - but it does mean I'm balancing my life and making everything more grounded. I promise I'm still continuing to read. I'm just maturing myself even further and allowing myself to see things in another new perspective. If there's something I can fully recommend about Brandon Sanderson's books it is the challenge in them to think from a new perspective with the religious ideas and magic systems. Add-on June 15th 2012: After a little more thought I decided that I'd post a little additional information. Some people argue that Sanderson's work is clich\u00e9 and long-winded. I can see the long-winded nature of his work in places but if we are talking clich\u00e9 he uses far less clich\u00e9s than other works of fiction. My argument will remain (until someone convinces me otherwise) that the use of clich\u00e9 is not necessarily bad writing. It is in fact a persuasive technique used to familiarise the audience with what you are writing. Yes an overworking of clich\u00e9 may be bad but to use clich\u00e9 here and there I do not agree is poor writing. My argument I back up with the fact that there are no truly original works of fiction anymore. I think most of the original plots were used up by the time Shakespeare came along. I mean I'm certain I could find a way in which any contemporary work of fiction imitates Shakespeare - who in turn imitated the stories of the Greek and Roman bards. This is of course a subjective argument and will remain so. Original Review: It is official. After having read Elantris and this first Mistborn novel (plus his work on the Wheel of Time) Brandon Sanderson is one of the best currently living fantasy authors around. Mistborn delves into political intrigue, into religion, into the masks people use to hide who they truly are, into superstition and into everyday human emotions. In many ways Mistborn addresses very deep philosophical issues while also being very entertaining. And that in my eyes is the mark of a great writer: a man or woman capable of creating an enjoyable story full of hidden depth. If you enjoyed Elantris you would enjoy this novel. There is a strong female character, little reliance on cliches and sound plotting and storytelling. The world building is incredibly memorable revealing Sanderson's incredible work ethic as he spares no liberties in layering his world with minutiae as well as a plethora of grand ideas. This is a living and breathing world written in a style that I very much enjoyed. The writing was literary in some aspects, poetic in others and all around a gentle narrative that could be grasped by any fantasy lover as something slightly more fresh. The magic system was very entertaining and the action derived from it exciting. However I still have a question. Like with many unique magic systems who was it that discovered they could digest metal and 'burn' it to induce specific results? Not only that they could only digest specific metals and perform such acts and the pewter has to be made a special way. Still I'm not complaining. It is simply a question that made me wonder. This is a grand imaginative tale. If you enjoy fantasy but have had enough of elves, dragons and dwarves (yes we all love Tolkien but sometimes authors need to break a little away from what other people have already written) read this. It will be something a little different centering on humans in a fantastical devastated land. ...more NOBODY TOUCH ME RIGHT NOW. REVIEW TO COME. A masterpiece in every way, Mistborn - The Final Empire doesn't just rise to the top of the fantasy genre, it actually redefines it!

The history books of the Final Empire tell of a battle that took place over 1,000 years ago, when a prophesied hero defeated a threat known only as The Deepness and gained the powers of a god to be come the Lord Ruler. However, the people of The Final Empire know better! They know that the omnipotent Lord Ruler that now dominates them all is no hero or god, but rather an abomination who enslaves and brutalizes most of his subjects in order to ensure that no one could ever gain enough power to over throw him. After 1,000 years of defeats, most of the enslaved people known as the skaa have lost the will to rise up against or even resist their cruel dominator. But then again, most people are not Kelsier... A thief and con artist, Kelsier believes he has finally found the proverbial crack in the Lord Ruler's seemingly indestructible suit of armor! And since the Lord Ruler has done everything he can to make the world one without heroes, Kelsier realizes that it will take a villain to save the people of the Final Empire. With a multi-layered plan and a gang of like-minded criminals, Kelsier is convinced he finally has the means to destroy the Lord Ruler and free the enslaved skaa. And possibly his greatest asset in this coming war will be his newest recruit, a teenaged girl named Vin. Vin believes she's just a common thief, but Kelsier learns that Vin is really a Mistborn, someone who can receive specific magical abilities from several different types of metals. Vin reluctantly joins Kelsier's cause, even though she suspects he may be a madman...and she may very well be right! After all, only a madman could believe he could possibly overthrow a god! A gang of rogues embark on an impossible quest to defeat an unstoppable foe... When I give a book five stars, it's for one of two reasons. Most of those perfect-score books fall into the first category, in which I gave it five stars simply because I enjoyed it the entire time I read it. These books may still have flaws, and they may lack in some areas, but as long as the author can keep me entertained throughout, a book can still get a perfect score even if it's not actually perfect. But then there's the rarely achieved second category, which I call the game-changers . These are the books that not only entertain me, they astonish me! They are so good, that they rejuvenate my love of reading and reaffirm my faith that the best authors can weave an absolutely magical tale. I'm happy to report that The Final Empire is such a book, one that will stay with me forever! Almost immediately, I was sucked into Brandon Sanderson's unique world. Every chapter begins with a quote which gives some insight into past events. While some authors make the misstep of revealing the book's backstory via clumsy exposition, Sanderson makes a brilliant move, revealing some pieces of it gradually throughout the chapter introductions, while also revealing the more significant events in conversations between Kelsier's gang of con artists and their newest member Vin. The more Vin learns of the history of her world, the more devoted she becomes to Kelsier's mission. Using this writing method, the story feels much more cohesive and organic than if Sanderson had simply revealed most of the backstory in one chapter. While the backstory is very compelling, the main story is even more so. While I've read other fantasy tales where the heroes want to save the world, I've rarely wanted to see a world saved as much as this one! The history of the skaa is absolutely heartbreaking, with some characters revealing the terrible atrocities that have been committed against them and their loved ones. Some of the skaas' tales of hardships and injustice are so sad, they will bring tears to the eyes of even the most stoic of readers. Another powerful theme explored throughout the story was the inequality between the skaa and the ruling noble class. When Vin infiltrates the world of the nobles as part of Kelsier's master plan, she is astounded to learn that they are not all as cruel as she would have imagined. Some of them are quite charming, and a few even do consider the well being of the skaa. Instead of simply adhering to a \"nobles-bad, skaa-good\" formula, Sanderson does inject some humanity into the noble side, which makes the hypocrisy of some of their actions that much more startling. Indeed, the \"nobles-vs-skaa\" conflict was one of the main reasons why I found that I wasn't just reading this book, I was absolutely feeling it! Another strength of Sanderson's world-building is not just in his masterful way of telling the story, but also in it's originality! Let's face it, if you pick up a book off the fantasy shelf, there's at least a 90% chance that an elf, dragon, or wizard will show up (usually all three). But Sanderson's world is utterly different than everything I've read before! Instead of falling back on the ever-reliable fantasy tropes of dragons, the people of The Final Empire whisper terrifying tales about bizarre creatures known as Mistwraiths, and try to avoid the all-seeing glare of the Steel Inquisitors, grotesque royal enforcers with steel spikes for eyes. Even the overall story of the book is a departure from the usual fantasy quest. While most fantasy books feature the heroes searching for some magical item or going off to fight an enemy directly, Kelsier's plan is far more complex. The main \"quest\" of this book comes in the form of a giant con, one which seeks to reshape the entire political and economic structure of the Empire. By pursuing such a Machiavellian scheme, Kelsier doesn't need to rely on some magical weapon to save the day, he creates his own magic! And speaking of magic... If there was any element of this book I had to say was the most original, it would definitely be the magic system. Here there are no wizards merely casting standard spells. Instead, the magic of the Mistborn is entirely dependant upon certain types of metals. Each of the metals gives the Mistborn a specific ability. For example, Mistborn can push against steel, so by anchoring themselves with steel coins on the ground, a Mistborn can push against the coin to fly up in the air! Other metals can give the user enhanced senses or the ability to manipulate emotions. This magic system leads to some truly amazing action sequences. Instead of \"been-there-done-that\" battles like swordfights and attackers approaching on horseback, here you may see a Mistborn magically pulling a helmet off of one attacker and pushing it into the second one, then flaring up the second man's anger so that he'll turn around and attack his own partner! In addition, Mistborn can only access these powers by ingesting metals for a finite number of uses, so this adds even more suspense to the battles. While the magic system can be a bit confusing at first, its complexity only adds to its appeal. Indeed, the originality of Mistborn's magic system is only exceeded by the magic present in Sanderson's storytelling abilities! Of course, all this wonderful storytelling could only achieve so much if the characters were dull, but fortunately Sanderson excels there too. Most of the secondary cast is comprised of various members of Kelsier's crew, each of whom has their own endearing personalities. From gruff Ham who often tries (albeit usually unsuccessfully) to engage in philosophical debates with his crewmates, to acerbic Breeze whose selfish and manipulative ways would have been annoying if only he weren't so amusing to listen too, the supporting cast is more fun than some other book's main characters! But the true stars of this show are Kelsier and Vin. Kelsier is pretty far-removed from the usual fantasy hero...he kills without mercy, he lies and cheats to get what he wants, and he seems to be more in love with himself than anyone else. Yet he is also witty and charismatic, and the more we learn of his tragic past, the more we come to love him despite his flaws (and there are many) . In contrast, while Kelsier loves to be the in the spotlight, Vin is terrified by it. Plagued by insecurities and cynical of the world she spent so much time hiding from, Vin is more vulnerable than the usual fantasy heroine, but this just adds to her appeal. Even when she learns how to utilize her magical abilities, Vin always retains her humanity, so instead of watching her grow as a heroine, we watch her grow as a person instead! This perfect mix of a fascinating story and engaging characters makes this book a true modern-day classic! DAVE'S FINAL JUDGMENT - THE DEFENSE - Refreshingly original world and magic system - Captivating characters whose flaws only make them that much more interesting - Backstory and main story are both incredibly compelling - Darker themes like slavery and social inequality are explored in an emotional and effective way - Unique and exciting fight sequences THE PROSECUTION - Magic system can get a little confusing at times - Sets the bar impossibly high for any books you read after this! THE VERDICT Mistborn: The Final Empire is so good, not only will it steal the heart of any fantasy lover, it may very well convert new readers to the fantasy genre! ...more The Final Empire genres are fantasy and sci-fi. I feel great to come back reading Sanderson's book. Alhamdulillah. I love this book so much Alhamdulillah! I remember when I have seen there are lots of people, who are fans of Mistborn series.They excited about Mistborn: House War board game, this board game will be releasing I don't know when and they talked about Mistborn book series. I thought what is so special about Mistborn series is it just book series? I have got Mistborn trilogy. Alhamdulilla The Final Empire genres are fantasy and sci-fi.

I thought what is so special about Mistborn series is it just book series? I have got Mistborn trilogy. Alhamdulillah! When I read a few pages of The Final Empire, I fall in love with the book. Now I understand why these people, who are fans and love Mistborn series. I will recommend anyone to read this book. In shaa Allah. I really like all of the characters in the book. I have seen a few websites that lots of people want Mistborn book series convert to film series. I don't think they should make film series of Mistborn because I love the way I Imagine in the book: characters, destination etc. The film will have special effects but what if we don't like special effects? the film will include the best parts in the book and imagine those people, who haven't read the book.They watched the film, which had converted from the book, they might enjoy it but disadvantages about the film are they wouldn't tell the audience what the characters are thinking and their point of views but the book does also what if we don't like the casts of actors and actresses, they selected for the characters? I think if any books/book series are good or popular then they shouldn't make movies same as games. The movie studios need to make their own ideas about storyline but not convert from the book to movie. The book always better than the film. For those people who had read Mistborn book series they will have higher expectation of Mistborn film series. They would expect that Mistborn film series good as Mistborn book series. This book is unpredictable! This book has focused on the character Vin mostly. I think anyone who really likes fantasy books or huge fans of Sanderson will love this book and they will enjoy read The Final Empire. This book does remind me of The Lords of the Rings because of the Dark Lord.

I mean I can, because it's Brandon Sanderson ! But seriously... This was an excellent high fantasy novel. I'm going to try to put my feelings into words, but I find I have a harder time writing positive reviews vs. negative reviews. The World/Magic System: This novel takes place in a world devoid of most of its natural color. It's a ruthless empire that has built its foundation on the backs of an enslaved \"lesser\" race, the Skaa. The noble houses dance around each other in deadly games of power and wealth, pawns before the great god-like Lord Ruler. Allomancy was by far one of my favorite aspects of this world. It was so creative! A magic system where you ingest and \"burn\" different pure metals in order to gain unique abilities? THAT IS SO COOL! I cannot get over how distinctive Sanderson's worlds are, they always leave a huge impression on me. When I think back on them after closing the book, I just want to know more . I want to know all of the complexities behind these systems, every nook and cranny. They're just that fascinating. The Characters: So one of my favorite literary situations is that of a band of rough, talented folks...thieves...miscreants...scammers... coming together to accomplish *the thing* . I think my love of this set up really began with The Thief Lord , which I read as a small child. Since then it's always appealed to me, and I honestly had no idea I would encounter it in this book. But it was so well done. Vin, a young member of a Skaa thieving crew, surviving the streets by brandishing her unique ability to bring \"luck\" to any given situation. Kelsier, an optimistic and cheerful leader with a dark, gruesome past. Breeze, a witty nobleman who's abandoned his title to participate in the dealings of the Skaa underworld. Sazed, a humble, kind-hearted scholar and Keeper who catalogs vast amounts of information so it is not lost to future generations. And these are only a couple of the unique characters present here. I loved the character interactions, I was deeply interested in their personal stories, and I took the trip with them wholeheartedly. The Plot: I want to say that while I totally adored this book, the plot is not something I've never seen before in its simplest form. It's essentially an oppressed group seeking to topple a privileged group. In this case, the Skaa people vs. the nobility of the Final Empire. However, the way in which these characters relate to the plot is what made it so special . I love authors that write rich histories and weave intricate political webs. I love when characters must examine and debate and weigh the consequences of their actions. This book hit all of the high points! When I read Sanderson's books, I get the feeling of someone painting a picture for me. It's large strokes and small strokes, bits of information here and there that come together in the end to form a masterpiece. Every time I pick one up, I instantly get a sense of returning home and I'm already looking forward to the day I reread The Final Empire . ...more \"But you can't kill me, Lord Tyrant. I represent that one thing you've never been able to kill, no matter how hard you try. I am hope.\u201c This book wrecked me. It was better than I expected. Robert Jordan's influence is apparent, but Sanderson is still original in sharing his imagination. He lays low on the clich\u00e9 and this novel is everything but predictable. It can also be read as a stand-alone, though I can't wait to continue with the series. A thousand years ago, a young man arose as the pro \"But you can't kill me, Lord Tyrant.

Robert Jordan's influence is apparent, but Sanderson is still original in sharing his imagination. He lays low on the clich\u00e9 and this novel is everything but predictable. It can also be read as a stand-alone, though I can't wait to continue with the series. A thousand years ago, a young man arose as the prophesied Hero of Ages. The nations and armies of the world were united beneath his leadership in attempt to challenge the Deepness, the mysterious force of darkness threatening to swallow the world. Apparently, Lord Ruler succeeded and he's more of a dictator than a righteous leader that everyone thought he would be. Since then, the entire world has been ruled by the Lord Ruler and his Final Empire. Those who supported him from the beginning became noble families. Everyone else became the skaa, slaves forced to work until they die. Every attempted rebellion failed and the dictatorship continued. Finally, a new kind of rebellion is being planned. Alomancy is a power of controlling different metals. Through swallowing and burning metals inside body, Alomancy enhances physical abilities such as strength and senses. It also allows pushing and pulling certain metals. There's a difference between users of Alomancy - Mistings who can burn only one metal, and Mistborns who can burn all of them. My favourite characters were the leaders in the rebellion. Only thing I didn't like was that HORRIBLE SCENE WHEN SOMETHING IRREPARABLE HAPPENS AND I WANT TO ERASE IT FROM MY MIND BECAUSE IT HURTS SO MUCH. I'M IN SUCH DENIAL SO JUST LET ME STAY IN MY HAPPY PLACE. It seems like every character has a significant part in the story. For every bit of information being revealed, there is always another secret to be found. When you think you\u2019ve got it all sorted out, more of those secrets are revealed. Sanderson made me furious, but he also made me laugh and surprised. The book contains tons of twists and the characterisation was excellent. I don\u2019t think there was any character that I found boring or useless. I didn't like that one sacrifice, but I understand its necessity EVEN THOUGH IT HURTS SO MUCH. Ok, I'm fine. No, I'm not, ugh. Mistborn delves into political theory, religion, superstition and all those masks people use to hide who they truly are. In many ways Mistborn deals with very deep philosophical issues. Though, magic system can get a little confusing at times, I had to read explanation of it every few pages. \u201cOur belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.\u201d Often, Sazed served as an emotional tether for Vin. Probably, she's tied the most to Kelsier, but this guy helped her gain peace. Also, his abilities are magnificent. Everything would've failed if it wasn't for him. Also, it's impossible for me not to love a guy who frequently reads and never loses his humbleness. \u201cYou said their prayer - is this the religion you believe in, then?\" \"I believe in them all.\"Vin frowned. \"None of them contradict each other?\"Sazed smiled. \"Oh, often and frequently they do. But, I respect the truths behind them all.\u201d Sazed, again. The main character is Vin, a young rogue who has never known neither friendship nor trust. Growing up with a delirious mother and an abusive brother, she never had a real chance of recognizing better options for life. In the beginning, she always tries to make herself seem as small as possible and believes everyone else will eventually betray her, just like her brother. I enjoyed the journey Vin had in analyzing the nobility through a noble woman\u2019s eyes, just like her contradicted feelings to Kelsier's cause and her own conclusion of the noble life. It's easy to get distracted by beautiful things and forget the tragedies and manipulation behind them. Vin grows from an unconfident, scared girl to Kelsier's asset and one of the leaders of the rebellion. She grew up to be wonderful character, but at times she was problematic. I liked her, but she annoyed me so much. Yes, she had a difficult childhood, but at what point do you say to yourself - IT'S ENOUGH. She was so full of angst, overthinking every singe detail and that was so tiresome. Truth be told, that was mostly in the start when she still wanted to just use the crew for her own gain and leave. Kelsier is my favorite character. He's free of every clich\u00e9 considering epic fantasy heroes and he's just incredible. He's ruthless because he is broken, but he's still caring, warm and fearless. He feels no guilt for his actions, because he believes in his cause and wants to help his kind. Basically, he's everything a true leader should be. He doesn't force his leadership, he lets people choose him. He\u2019s fair, intelligent and charismatic. He knows how to control himself and only loses it when he\u2019s been pushed more than he could tolerate. And when he does lose his coolness, mostly he kicks ass. Nothing in his personality is black and white - he kills without mercy, he lies and cheats to get what he wants, and he seems to be more in love with himself than anyone else. But everything he does, it's not for satisfying his ego it's for the greater cause. The more we learn about his tragic past, the more we love him despite of his flaws and mistakes. \u201cIf you\u2019re always on time, it implies that you never have anything better you should be doing.\u201d Kelsier's also funny and witty, always ready for excellent comebacks and one-liners. His charisma definitely stole the show. It's so hard to get angry with him. You can see how all other Mistings often were furious with him, but easily forgave him. Elend's maybe your clich\u00e9d love interest, but I adore him anyway. He's not obnoxious in any way, his personality is subtly developed and honestly, how can I not love the prince who reads? He's an idealist who thinks that words are the most succesful weapons and that there is more to politics than its surface. Kelsier and Vin have such a powerful bond. I admit I shipped them romantically but I love how they developed father-daughter relationship that was based on complete understanding and loyalty. He literally saved her from herself and she brought him down to the ground with some level of rationality. \u201cI'm not really sure why. But... do you stop loving someone just because they betray you? I don't think so. That's what makes the betrayal hurt so much - pain, frustration, anger... and I still loved her. I still do.\" I was consumed in ALL of their deep conversations, they were so full of emotion and trust. They made me cry multiple times. Despite of their age difference, I really feel like they've grown so much together. AND THAT ONE LETTER BROKE MY HEART, OKAY. Yes, I ship Vin and Elend. As much as I could see, not many people found them interesting, but I think they're cute. Their relationship progressed naturally and let's not forget they had more than 6 months of development which wasn't based on making out, but on actual conversations. \u201cI told him that you were simply showing me the ways of court. Kind of like an\u2026older brother.\u201d \u201cOlder brother?\u201d Elend asked, frowning.\u201cMuch older,\u201d Vin said, smiling. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got to be at least twice my age.\u201d \u201cTwice your\u2026Valette, I\u2019m twenty-one. Unless you\u2019re a very mature ten-year-old, I\u2019m nowhere near \u2018twice your age.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never been good with math,\u201d Vin said offhandedly.\u201d Of course, I adore their banter. A few times I actually started skipping pages just so I could see when their next interaction will be. What can I say, I always fall for young loves like theirs. In a way it serves as a comic relief, but I like nothing more than to see my heroine actually SMILING. ...more Yes it took me a while to finish this book, but university just takes so much out of you!

This book deserves every single one of those stars, and I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel. Elend and vin better get their happily ever after........

I've been dying to read this series!!!!!!!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.\" MY SYNOPSIS: It's been a thousand years since people have seen the sun or a flower...a thousand years since the Lord Ruler claimed control over the world, since he assumed the role of the Hero of Ages. In those thousand years, the skaa (the peasants) have been enslaved to the nobles. The only thing that separates the two classes is the fact that the nobles are occasionally born with gifts...the use of different metals to perform tasks such as Soothing, Rioting, Pushing, and more. But occasionally, interbreeding between the two classes produces a skaa with these abilities. That's why the Lord Ruler prohibits relationships between nobility and skaa. If a noble man must slake his desires on a skaa, he is to kill them soon after. Occasionally, one slips through the cracks. Occasionally, one of those forgotten children has a gift. But rarely...very rarely, there is one born with the gift of all metals. And WOW, are they powerful... A Mistborn. Nobles who are Mistborn are trained from birth to use their gifts, but the lowly skaa Mistborn must hide their secret, if they even know what they are to begin with. Kelsier is the Survivor...the legendary skaa Mistborn who came upon his talents while being held prisoner by the Lord Ruler...and escaping. Now he travels the lands, an anarchist with a noble goal. He stirs up dissention in the suppressed skaa, knowing that these beat down people will continue living a life of slavery and persecution unless they have one thing...Hope. These people need a reason to fight back. A reason to become something more than what they have been for so many centuries. A reason to believe that there is a chance at beating an immortal ruler, a man who claims to be a piece of God Himself. So Kelsier gives them a reason. He gathers a group of powerful skaa...each works a different metal, and one...one is very special indeed. Min has been a skaa streetrat her entire life. Born to a crazy woman and \"raised\" amid the wolves by her brother, she's lived a life of thievery and starvation, under the constant threat of rape and abuse. \"The beatings almost didn't hurt any more, for Reen's frequent abuses had left Vin resilient, while at he same time teaching her how to look pathetic and broken. In a way, the beatings were self-defeating. Bruises and welts mended, but each new lasing left Vin more hardened. Stronger...\" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ MY THOUGHTS: My, oh my! This is a series that caught so much attention after Brandon Sanderson stormed onto the fantasy scene upon finishing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. For hard core readers of the genre, he had already grabbed a little attention, but for me and many other readers, he might have just fallen through the crack had it not been for that particular honor. Well, he's just proved himself to me! (By the way, the fan art for this series is UNREAL!!!) This world building is some of the best I've read. Often the info dump for a new series...especially fantasy, when everything is new...is too much to hold my interest. Even if the reader needs to know the details, it's eventually boring to read an obvious talking head describe why the sky is red, the people are tired...blah blah blah. But Sanderson begins the story with a bang that basically just dumps the world at you and forces you to sink into it, hold on, and keep reading. As the story progresses, little details start to unfold and keep unfolding throughout the entire book. As soon as I would start to wonder about something, the question was answered. Masterfully done, that... I'm not much for political books and while this was chock full of political intrigue, it almost reminded me of the historical books that I've read involving the ton . Lots of rich, gossipy, oblivious to suffering people who use and abuse the lower classes to aid them in becoming even more rich and fabulous. They just don't SEE the skaa as people...their guards and taskmasters are horrifically brutal. And they don't care. I'm beginning to ramble. Let me just say this: I came to care about these characters so much...and Sanderson isn't one to hold on to what the readers want. He forged his own path with this book...no character loyalty here! Expect the unexpected!!! It's a great ride, a remarkably original world, and his characterization is fantastic. The growth I can see for the next couple of books has me super excited!! There are surprising moments of funny: \"People,\" Marsh said. \"People who were just trying to do the best with what life gave them.\" \"Well, I'm just doing the same thing,\" Kelsier said. \"And fortunately, life gave me the ability to push meant like them off the tops of buildings.\" And moments of triumph, moments of true heartbreak, and moments of even greater hope. That's the message here. After a thousand years of hopelessness, there is finally a group of people who are all willing to lay their lives on the line to save the world. Even when it seems as if it's not worth saving. \"You ask why I smile, Goodman Mennis? Well, the Lord Ruler thinks he has claimed laughter and joy for himself. I'm disinclined to let him do so. This is one battle that doesn't take much effort to fight.\" ...more This was the one and only book I've read by Brandon Sanderson and it did not disappoint.

The Final Empire is a unique fantasy story that I was not prepared for when I started reading it. The distinctly different but unforgettable characters, the insanely strategic plotting and planning, the plot twists and overall overwhelming moments that create this epic story, is unbelievable. This story focused on a few main characters at different parts in the story. The beginning and middle-ish of the book felt like Kelsier was the MC and delved into his past, his plans, thoughts and emotions more than it did anyone else. Then as the story progresses Vin switches MC importance with him and it focuses on her a bit more than it originally did to start with. I'm not sure what to really feel about Elend's character, I like his philosophical enthusiasm and his compassion of other people's sufferings and hardships but not too stoked about his role as the love of Vin's life. He seems kinda misplaced in that regard, in my opinion. But hopefully if they are really supposed to be together I'll grow to like him more. Fingers crossed on that. And lastly the ending shocked me, I didn't see half of what happened coming. Kelsier is a true mastermind, he didn't just think 2-3 steps ahead in his plans he thought 8-9 steps ahead and every twist and turn in between, he analyzed and thought out the best possible outcome in the most ingenious of ways. I loved this book and am really looking forward to the second one :) ...more", "Title": "The Final Empire"},
