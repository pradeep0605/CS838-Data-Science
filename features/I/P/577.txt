The second son of Yesugei, chieftain of the Wolves. A boy called Temujin, who would later pass into legend as the greatest conqueror in all history. Leave it to <---A>Conn Iggulden</---A> to tell the tale of a legendary historical figure in the most captivating and spectacular fashion\u2026 The story of the barbarian warlord who would later be known as <---C>Genghis Khan</---C> is a deeply fascinating one. It\u2019s the tale of a man who went from being a chieftain\u2019s son in a minor tribe to ruling the greatest empire the world had ever seen at the time. The first part of that tale is retold by Conn Iggulden in this book, and it\u2019s an amazing journey to be brought along on. I was actually a bit worried early on as the book wasn\u2019t particularly impressive until almost halfway through. The early parts were quite slow and contained little to no suspense at all. However,<---M> once the plot actually got going</---M>, there was no turning back. There were times when I thought this book was the best I\u2019d read this year for sure. Unfortunately it failed to reach that level in the end, but it got pretty close. Iggulden is often accused of completely ignoring historical accuracy, and often that\u2019s even true, but what does it matter when you can tell stories like this? In just about every single aspect of writing, he\u2019s second only to Bernard Cornwell himself in this particular genre. As the opening book of a series, this was really good. It sets the stage for what is to come, with an interesting setting and set of characters. For some reason it seemed a little bit too simple, in that the storyline, the number of important characters and the area in which the story takes place are all really limited; but then again, this is only the first book, and it serves its purpose as an introduction and a taste of what is to come. So far, I must say that the series is not quite as good as Iggulden\u2019s Emperor series, but it definitely has the potential for it. The best part about the whole thing was that I was dragged by the heels out of my terrible reading funk. It didn\u2019t even take the whole book to do it, just this particular quote, which might just be the best historical fiction line I\u2019ve encountered\u2026 \u201cI am the land, and the bones of the hills,\" he said fiercely, \"I am the winter. When I am dead, I will come for you all in the coldest nights.\u201d ...more Temujin, the son of Yesugei, khan of the Wolves, goes to a neighboring tribe to find a wife.

The story of Temujin and his rise to uniting the tribes against the Tartars is a powerful one. Temujin goes through a lot Temujin, the son of Yesugei, khan of the Wolves, goes to a neighboring tribe to find a wife. While he's away, his father is murdered by a gang of Tartars. Worse still, his father's friend usurps the role of khan and leaves Temujin and his family to die on the steppe. Can Temujin and his family survive long enough to get revenge on the Tartars and regain control of the Wolves? The story of Temujin and his rise to uniting the tribes against the Tartars is a powerful one. Temujin goes through a lot of hell from the age of twelve onward, from being abandoned on the steppe during winter, to being imprisoned in a pit and being urinated on, to having his wife kidnapped and raped by Tartars. Once he started uniting the tribes, even I felt like riding with the young khan. While he's not always likeable, he's definitely a charismatic character. The action scenes were by far the highlight of the book. People get peppered with arrows or hacked to death by swords on a fairly regular basis. While Iggulden plays fast and loose with history, it's still a great story. And since I'm already aware I'm reading fiction, I don't really care about historical accuracy. Iggulden's writing makes for an engaging read. You will not easily be able to put this down. ...more U\u017eivao sam \u010ditaju\u0107i Igguldenov serijal Imperator o usponu i padu Julija Cezara, a i za\u017eelio sam se malo akcijskih povijesnih romana, pa sam krenuo \u010ditati ovaj serijal.

O Lobo das Plan\u00edcies \u00e9 o primeiro livro da s\u00e9rie O Conquistador, composta por 4 outros, e nos apresenta o in\u00edcio da vida de Temujin, filho do chefe da tribo dos Lobos, vivendo em terras mong\u00f3is. Tudo come\u00e7a a dar errado quando o pai de Temujin morre ap\u00f3s ser atacado por alguns T\u00e1rtaros, o que desencadeia uma s\u00e9rie de trag\u00e9dias na vida dele. O novo khan dos Lobos abandona a fam\u00edlia de Temujin no meio de um inverno rigoroso e sem comida, deixando-os l\u00e1 para morrer. Vale destacar aqui a fibra moral e a for\u00e7a de vontade da m\u00e3e do protagonista, pois eu n\u00e3o imagino a dificuldade de se criar CINCO filhos em um local praticamente sem comida e com a amea\u00e7a de ser morto por qualquer grupo de guerreiros que aparecesse. \u201cThere was no justice in the world, but he had known that ever since the death of his father. The spirits took no part in the lives of men once they had been born. A man either endured what the world sent his way, or was crushed.\u201d A escrita do autor \u00e9 simples e direta, sem muitos rodeios e, mesmo que os primeiros 57% do livro s\u00e3o dedicados a Temujin dos 11 aos 14 anos, isso n\u00e3o tornou-se mon\u00f3tono em momento algum, tanto \u00e9 que eu sempre terminava um cap\u00edtulo e ansiava por mais, queria descobrir o que acontecia com a fam\u00edlia do protagonista e o que eles fizeram para sobreviver, as prova\u00e7\u00f5es que tiveram que passar para aguentar um ambiente t\u00e3o hostil e perigoso. O tempo passa e eles sobrevivem, sempre com a amea\u00e7a de aparecer algum T\u00e1rtaro pelo caminho ou a tribo dos Lobos voltar para ver se o inverno fez o servi\u00e7o completo. O \u00f3dio de Temujin e seus irm\u00e3os pelo atual khan dos Lobos \u00e9 t\u00e3o, mas t\u00e3o intenso, que a vida deles resume-se a vingan\u00e7a, pela alma de seu pai, pela chance de poderem viver novamente . Lembro tamb\u00e9m da parte inicial do livro, quando Temujin e seus irm\u00e3os saem na busca por um filhote de \u00e1guia no topo de uma montanha para dar de presente ao pai e acabam encontrando dois deles, como se isso fosse uma vontade dos deuses. Nessa parte j\u00e1 podemos perceber a forte rela\u00e7\u00e3o que os irm\u00e3os ter\u00e3o ao longo da hist\u00f3ria, seja para o bem ou para o mal, como o leitor acabar\u00e1 descobrindo alguns cap\u00edtulos depois. Esse livro \u00e9 s\u00f3 o come\u00e7o da hist\u00f3ria de uma na\u00e7\u00e3o, de um homem que manteve os fantasmas do seu passado bem vivos na sua cabe\u00e7a para que ele se tornasse um l\u00edder cruel e sem medo de expandir os seus territ\u00f3rios, matando qualquer um que aparecesse no seu caminho e tentasse atrapalhar o seu sonho: juntar todas as tribos mong\u00f3is em uma s\u00f3 , torn\u00e1-los somente um povo. \u201cYou will revenge my father's death and we will be one tribe across the face of the plains, one people.<---F> As it should always have been</---F>. LET THE TARTARS FEAR US THEN! LET THE CHIN FEAR US!\u201d Conn Iggulden focou intensamente na parte psicol\u00f3gica do personagem principal e seus familiares nesse livro, trazendo \u00e0 tona toda as adversidades passadas por Temujin na sua inf\u00e2ncia e como isso realmente moldou o seu car\u00e1ter para que ele se tornasse como \u00e9 conhecido hoje: o maior conquistador da Hist\u00f3ria, o implac\u00e1vel e impiedoso Genghis Khan , reverenciado at\u00e9 hoje como um dos maiores estrategistas que o mundo teve a honra de conhecer. \u201cWe are the silver people, the Mongols. When they ask, tell them there are no tribes. Tell them I am khan of the sea of grass, and they will know me by that name, as Genghis. Yes, tell them that. Tell them that I am Genghis and I WILL RIDE.\u201d Tch\u00ea, eu preciso mesmo dizer que eu gostei demais desse livro? A hist\u00f3ria de Temujin \u00e9 LINDA, se \u00e9 que existe uma palavra melhor para descrev\u00ea-la, e s\u00f3 desbravando-a ser\u00e1 poss\u00edvel entender como viveu Genghis Khan e sua fam\u00edlia. S\u00e3o v\u00e1rios momentos de tens\u00e3o durante a narrativa que fica dif\u00edcil n\u00e3o torcer por Temujin e vibrar quando os seus golpes encontram o cora\u00e7\u00e3o do inimigo, quando ele sofre por estar quase morrendo, quando ele est\u00e1 na linha de frente em uma batalha, quando ele est\u00e1 s\u00f3 respirando, enfim! haha Leitura recomendad\u00edssima, principalmente para quem gosta de livros no estilo de Bernard Cornwell. As batalhas s\u00e3o bem descritas, os conflitos do personagem com as pessoas pr\u00f3ximas s\u00e3o bem intensos e voc\u00eas ir\u00e3o se surpreender com a qualidade da escrita de Iggulden, juntando uma narrativa simples com fatos hist\u00f3ricos (alguns foram mudados, j\u00e1 que essa \u00e9 uma obra de fic\u00e7\u00e3o). Pretendo ler o segundo ainda em 2015, Temujin certamente merece mais aten\u00e7\u00e3o! ...more I've always been curious about almost anything that happened in the past.

After uniting the Mongol tribes <+++>Genghis: Birth of an Empire</+++> , Genghis later on targets and conquers the Chin Genghis: Lords of the Bow . I fully enjoyed the two books. Despite the difficulty of telling fiction from fact, it was still worthwhile. However, this is not a history book, and there's plenty of room for creativity. The book certainly has plenty of endless battles and plenty and discusses war strategies. The most famous and gruesome battle, described in detail by Iggulden, is the one fought at the Badger Mouth. To combat the Mongol advance, the Chin had assembled approximately half a million soldiers (versus the Mongol's 100 thousand) and stationed them at Badger Mouth. However, the Chin appeared to have been overly confident in their numbers and mainly in their defensive position: Genghis eventually circumvented their defenses by sending part of his men over the peaks surrounding the pass, something the Chin thought impossible, allowing him to encircle the much larger army. As a result, he slaughtered thousands and the enemy\u2019s soldiers and practically destroyed its army. Advancing, the Mongols came to besiege the Chin capital of Yenking (modern day Beijing). There Genghis faced the hard fact of an army (with memories of their own inner resentments) that he had to keep not only fed with spirits but with battles and triumphs. After a siege of years, the city finally surrendered. Regardless, it shows a ruthless man that must have been brilliant and astute to have conquered so much, considering he came from a nomadic and small tribe and his crudeness. I enjoyed reading Iggulden\u2019s version of life in the China of that time, how the Mongol and Chinese mixed and related to each to each other. Moreover, reading this book started me into a new interest in reading military fiction that extends into today. I loved both volumes, although I have yet to read the third. I recommend Iggulden's Genghis Khan story to fans of non-romantic historical and military fiction. ...more \u064a\u0638\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628

Although this book gallops along at Conn Iggulden's usual pace, I was continually tempted to leap ahead to find out what happened next. That makes it much more of a chapter-turner than merely a page-turner, and the narrative left me quite breathless at times! Temujin is the son of the khan of one of the many Mongol tribes who are in continual, violent conflict. Without spoiling the story for you, his circumstances force him to grow up very quickly rather than lose his life. As the story unfolds, Temujin faces death many times and learns from his terrifying experiences. His list of those on whom he determines to wreak revenge grows as you read. Eventually, he becomes the respected, feared and uncompromising leader of the great horde which dominated two continents during that age. Had his childhood been easy, he would probably have settled down with a couple of wives and a few goats. Historic record shows otherwise, but that record hardly brings Ghengis Khan's tale to life in the way that Iggulden has managed in this book. I would recommend this book to anybody, and would challenge them to resist being swept along by such a brilliantly told story. I just can't wait to get my hands on the next episode, \"Lords of the Bow,\" in January 2008. ...more My #10 Read of 2014 Perfectly Executed Historical Fiction - 5 Stars Action, Drama, Romance, History and Suspense, Birth of an Empire has it all.

This volume robbed me of several full nights of sleep and I need to press on to see how the story would resolve. The story unfolds quickly while at the same time the author maintains his eye for detail. Birth of an Empire is my favorite type of HF. If you enjoy HF that places a premium on action and military (or in this case raiders) and war, then you will enjoy this novel. Plot summary The story tells of the early years of Temujin, or Genghis Khan as most people would know him. We begin in the Pre-Teen years of Genghis and we learn how his relationship with his father and his brother, molded him into the man he would become. The novel covers much the sparsely documented childhood experience from his family's banishment, to his imprisonment and on toward his ultimate quest for victory. The Good They Did What? The Author did a wonderful job of infusing the story with the practices, beliefs, prejudices and realities of the of the Mongol people during this period of history. From the warriors ability to live on mares milk and blood for extended periods, their social structure, their weapons and their customs, you are transported to the Mongolian plains and your home becomes a Mongolian ger while you enjoy the story. The Author not only consulted the ancient texts regarding Genghis Khan, but he spent time amongst the Mongolian people before writing the books. His effort and dedication was obvious. Genghis is my Friend Like any other genre, HF has its own pitfalls to avoid. One such pitfall is focus on the period of time to the detriment of the characters. In this story, the author present a well balanced story. As stated above, the reader is firmly grounded in the place and time while at same time, the characters are bold, vibrant and multi-dimensional. The reader is presented with a vivid picture of not only Genghis but his four brothers, his parents (especially his father), his wife and his major enemies. This results in a well rounded story that allow for full immersion. The Bad Take it Easy, I'm so Tired As is most 5 stars review, I have little criticism for the book. Firstly, the story robbed me of many hours of sleep. On more than one night, when my bedside clock was reading 1 am, I forced myself to shut the kindle and close my eyes. Outside of this, the only minor complaint is the description of the battle and fights. The pace of the book is quick and little space is wasted. Unfortunately, this results in some rather quick descriptions of battle and important events. In this case, it did not affect my rating as the battles were a minor part of the book. Final Thoughts In my opinion, this is a perfect specimen of HF. I enjoyed it and it is easily the best book I have read this year and I anticipate it will make my top 10 at the end of the year. Overall, the story is compelling. While the average reader will have some idea of the sheer force that Genghis Kahn ultimately became, that knowledge is far more amazing when you consider his humble beginnings. A must read. Audiobook Notes Content Advisories It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations. Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex - 2.5 There is a small amount of sex in the book. There are several instances where sex between the characters is implied. Beyond consensual sex, there were several instances of rape. Most of the instances were comments that rape had occurred or would occur but there was one scene in which there was an attempted rape. While it was not graphic, there was some mild description of previous instances. One of the characters states his wish to use the service of a prostitute on several occasions. Overall, the sexual content served as context for the time and was not graphic. Language - 2 The language in the book was the traditional adult language. The derogatory terms were specific to the time. While the characters would often refer to others with these terms, they would not be considered swearing by todays standards. Violence - 4 The story was told in a violent time. Fight and battles between tribes was constant. From the early stages there are multiple murders that are moderately graphic. A character is subjected to abuse and forms of torture. This is moderately graphic. As Genghis ages, the violence increases. There is a particularly graphic scene in which part of person heart is eaten. Violence is a persistent theme in the story. While it is plentiful, the moderate graphic nature of the majority leads to a 4 rating. You may wish to skip this novel if you are sensitive to violence and death. ...more 2.5 Stars This was a decent work of historical fiction with a brilliantly realised setting that was ultimately let down by some pacing and characterisation issues. I should probably say at this point that I'm a massive history nerd and I've read a lot about Genghis Khan. Some of my complaints about this book (and probably part of the reason I'm rating it lower than most of my friends) are down to the way that some events and characters were presented by Iggulden in contrast with my previous under 2.5 Stars This was a decent work of historical fiction with a brilliantly realised setting that was ultimately let down by some pacing and characterisation issues. I should probably say at this point that I'm a massive history nerd and I've read a lot about Genghis Khan. Some of my complaints about this book (and probably part of the reason I'm rating it lower than most of my friends) are down to the way that some events and characters were presented by Iggulden in contrast with my previous understanding of what happened. I can't say whose interpretation is better... although if the measurement is sales of historical fiction books probably Iggulden. Genghis Khan's rise to power is one of the most incredible stories ever told. It's a story of betrayal, hardship, violence, ambition and revenge. While a lot of these aspects were carried over into this book, I was still a bit disappointed with the pace of the story, especially early on. For the first half of this book Temujin suffers betrayal and scorn at every turn. Despite often vowing revenge he doesn't achieve anything before running into the next conflict. All of these conflicts building up, with no resolution in sight, made it really difficult foe me to enjoy these parts of the book. For me the strongest element of this book was the setting. Iggulden does an incredible job of bringing the harshness and brutality of the Mongolian plains to life. The vivid description of the landscape made the accounts of Genghis' family struggling to survive on the barren plains an especially gripping and intense section. The determination of Mongolian warriors is also explored as we see these men fire bows (with a draw weight of 200 pounds, all held on a couple of fingers) from horseback and survive days of strenuous riding and fighting on milk and blood from their mares. Mongol society as a whole is also written with a great eye for detail. Throughout the book 'Gers', 'deals' and other important features of the Mongolian lifestyle were drilled into my brain. Throughout this story there are a number of interesting characters but I was disappointed by their lack of depth and complexity. Genghis' brothers play major roles, both as part of the story and as part of the Khan's ambitions. The brothers were some of my favourite characters and their relationships with each other were especially well-written. Hoelun, Genghis' formidable mother, was a character I was really psyched to read about. For the most part I really enjoyed her parts but (Spoilers*) I was frustrated by the drama between her and Gengis after he killed Bekter. Her blindness to Bekters selfishness and brutality and the fact that she seemingly didn't mind that he was feeding himself while allowing the rest of the family to starve was completely at odds with her usual pragmatism. Historical fact incoming: Bekter wasn't even her son. He was actually her husband's son from a previous marriage so it wouldn't really make sense for her to be upset that her son had removed a rival to himself and threat to the family. I was also disappointed by the Genghis-Borte romance as I've always considered their relationship to be an incredible narrative. The story of how the most ruthlessly effective conqueror to ever live went to war for the first time to save the woman he loved was really moving. I was disappointed with the lack of depth and passion in their relationship in this book. Okay that was a pretty wussy point so to balance it out: That scene where Genghis and his brothers killed those herders was awesome. Killing and looting = man stuff. While the descriptions of fighting were suitably gritty and brutal I was disappointed at the lack of exploration of Genghis' military strategy. At one point Genghis' forces win a battle despite being outnumbered (possibly badly outnumbered) by simply charging straight at the enemy. Later on Genghis takes control of 3 of the most powerful tribes in Mongolia by murdering a Khan and fighting a couple of duels. I was hoping to get an insight into the long years of constant war and alliance making that turned Temujin into 'Genghis Khan' but instead a well-timed invasion from the evil Tartars forces everyone to agree to join up with Genghis. Overall this was a decent piece of historical fiction with a lot of good qualities. I might check out the continuation of this story sometime to see if I can better get into the continuation of the story of Genghis Khan. ...more I started reading this novel with a strange curiosity about the early life of Genghis Khan, having already read three non-fiction titles about his life-time conquests and those of his offspring.

I ended up being deeply touched by the skilful crafting of a poignant coming-of-age tale portraying the young and fearless tribal leader. His unbeatable will to survive as a precocious male child of an ostracized and fatherless family in the harshest of environments is destined to make him a formidable tribal head and chart the winning course of his inimitable adult life. Still a young teen, he had to face the sudden loss of a father, heartless betrayals, constant cold and hunger, homelessness, deadly traps and all kinds of brutal life threats. It is hard not to believe that there is some truth in fiction in this case, as it can probably be surmised that what happens to a person in his/her early formative years is most likely to give shape to his/her character. The novel is sprinkled with occasional gory scenes and graphic details, but also does not lack sentimental episodes. Overall, it is a gripping read. The author explains in a note that his chief source of historical details largely comes from Arthur Waley\u2019s translation of a Chinese version of \u201cThe Secret History of the Mongols\u201d, the original Mongolian text of which was written in the 13th century, after the death of Genghis Khan. Late last year I read The History And The Life Of Chinggis Khan: The Secret History Of The Mongols , which is the Mongolian scholar Urgunge Onon\u2019s translation of the original 13th century text, and early this year I read Jack Weatherford\u2019s two non-fiction titles: Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World and The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire . These three books together gave me a pretty good picture of the times and lives of Genghis Khan and his successors. ...more \u0623\u062a\u0631\u062f\u062f \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0641\u064a

I found the book engaging from start to finish. Conn Iggulden does a good job of telling a tale set in a harsh landscape, home to a warrior culture that was proud and often cruel. Weakness is despised and men are expected to suppress outward displays of emotion and instead show the \u201cCold Face,\u201d especially in the face of their enemies. This was a rather straight forward easy read as we get snap shots of the major events in Temujin's life, from his happy early years when his father, Yesugei, was khan of the Wolves, to his betrayal, to his vision of uniting all the Mongol tribes under one banner \u2013 his banner. Iggulden gives us a fair look at the male dominated culture of the Mongols and we learn a bit about their major enemies, the Tartar , as well as the Chin who try to play the two off against each other. There\u2019s plenty of blood-letting. Plenty of battle action centred around archery, given that archery, particularly horse archery, was the Mongols' weapon of mass destruction. Temujin AKA Genghis starts out pretty early in life as an uber archer, and then adds uber swordsman to his repertoire and finally uber uber general. If this wasn't based somewhat in reality one could be forgiven for complaining that Temujin is way over-powered (and he probably is in this book at times) and the narrative moving quickly over a number of years did make it seem that success came too easily for him. Also, the fact that this reads like every boys fantasy of ninja/samarai badassery probably put a bit of a dampener on the gravitas that the historical Genghis arguably warrants. But I didn't really care about that. Cool is cool and this appealed to my inner ninja and there were a few scenes that had me reaching for my sword and showing my enemy the \u201cCold Face\u201d - which I consider to be a fair achievement given that my enemy looked absolutely ridiculous staring back at me from the mirror wielding his plastic lightsaber. A quick, easy, enjoyable read and I\u2019m off to start the next book in the series 4.25 ninja stars. PS: Yes yes, I know Ninja and Samurai have nothing to do with Mongols - but little boys don't. ...more 3.5 to 4.0 stars.

I really liked the sense of place established by the narrative as well as the extremely harsh conditions under which Genghis lived. This first volume of what I believe to be a trilogy tells the story of Temujin (birth name of Genghis) from his early years to the beginning of his rise to power. As good as this story was, I am confident that the next book will be even better given that it will deal with Temujin's conquest of much of Asia which should make for fascinating reading. Strongly recommended for fans of historical fiction. One final note: I listened to the audiobook narrated by Stefan Rudnicki who did his usual AMAZING job with the story. ...more I believe this is the best book I have read all year. It is the story of how Genghis was shaped and molded as a child into one of the greatest conqurers and ruler of tribes ever. \"The greatest joy a man can know is to conquer his enamies and drive them before him, to ride their horses,to take away their pocessions, to see the faces of those who are dear to them become dewy with tears, to clasp his wives and daughters in his arm,s.\" Genghis Khan The first volume of Conn Iggulden's historical novel series: Conqueror series tells an remarkable and formidable tale of Genghis Khan's origin and the birth of the Mongol Empire.

Note: for some unknown reason the Chinese translation duds the book's title as Conqueror: Wolf of the Plain/\u5f81\u670d\u8005\ufe30\u701a\u6d77\u84bc\u72fc instead of Genghis: Birth of an Empire . As the second son of Yes\u00fcgei (leader of the Borjigin clan), the young Tem\u00fcjin lived a comfortable life, but his father was later assassinated and the clan chose a new leader then Tem\u00fcjin and his family was abandoned on the harsh plain for death. Being forced to survive with only the clothes on their backs and their wits, the family went up against impossible odds and committed the unthinkable for survival. Aside from the despair need to survive, the burning desire for revenge was the driving force that kept the young Tem\u00fcjin and his brothers going. This book is not only just an intriguing coming-of-age, survival-themed and 'rags to rich' story, it also gives us a vivid picture of how life on the Mongolian harsh plain was like at that time. I also like how the different tribes' way of life is described with rich details. (the author is known for going to Mongolia for research) Also I admire how the author also expresses the spirit and morals of the Mongol people of that time: they lived at the mercy of the harsh plain; outside of their horses, livestock, weapons and their own wits these people had nothing to depend on. Kill or be killed, rob or be robbed, winner takes all, was more or less their way of life. And how the author writes about those details is simply..........impressive. Through his writing and the development of Tem\u00fcjin who grows from a boy who lost everything, to the leader of a small band of bandits, then eventually a young Khan who sets his sight on conquering the entire plain. There are many shocking twists in Tem\u00fcjin's tale, for example (view spoiler) [he killed his older brother after the latter kept food for himself when the rest of the family was starving (hide spoiler) ] , and I think you will enjoy them as well. Last but not least, the final battle at the ending part of the book is also extraordinarily written, the author writes like he is bringing you right to the battle field and letting you experience the wind blowing past you as the riders matched down the hill, as arrows flying through the sky and battle cries were shout across the plain. PS: please notice that this book is a historical novel, so many details aren't exactly accurate.

If this were a novel about the early years of the Sun King or the first Incan ruler, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d continue. The writing isn\u2019t bad, and sometimes approaches a level that makes readers feel they\u2019re there. Examples of this are an early scene where Temujin climbs a steep hillside to capture two eagle chicks for his father and the scene where he\u2019s tortured by his father\u2019s erstwhile bondsman, Eeluk, who has usurped control of the nomad band the future khan\u2019s father had ruled. A failure is the set up of Temujin\u2019s relationship with Borte, his wife. Rather it\u2019s the lack of one. Iggulden introduces Borte as a 12-year-old tomboy who\u2019s so dirty that Temujin is hard pressed to recognize whether she\u2019s a boy or a girl, and his primary concern is that she\u2019s not too ugly. Yet when she follows him one night and he stumbles upon her, the sound of her voice and a touch of her cheek and it\u2019s love. Which points up another issue with the book, and that\u2019s that, with the exception of Temujin, none of the other characters \u2013 Hoelun (his mother) or his brothers, Bekter, Khasar, Kachiun & Temuge, for example \u2013 come alive as individuals. I will mention one of the better aspects of Iggulden\u2019s writing \u2013 since I do want to provide another example of the author\u2019s skills \u2013 and that is his depiction of the ethical outlook of nomad life. There\u2019s only one instance where I think he stumbles in this regard (Temujin\u2019s reaction to Borte\u2019s abduction and rape*/!); otherwise, the reader does spend a lot of time in a truly alien way of life. I\u2019ll continue with the series because the writing is engaging enough and because of the Mongol angle but unless the characters become more interesting or the writing becomes significantly better, I doubt these books will be well remembered a decade from now. * The abduction is historical though the perpetrators & its length were changed. ! My objection is to the sensitivity with which Temujin deals with her. I\u2019m not saying he wouldn\u2019t (and didn\u2019t) act so \u201ccivilized,\u201d but there was no building of a foundation to make it believable. ...more I started Genghis Birth of an Empire with a bit of trepidation.

A young prince finds himself in the lowest of situations, facing death. He finds a way to survive and rises to his intended greatness. The Mongolian setting is not unlike a setting in a fantasy novel. I usually think of historical fiction as being more romantic and less epic. I knew very little about Genghis Khan when I started this novel. For one, I had no idea that his life and conquests were so heavily documented. In his afterward, Iggulden says that he relies heavily on primary sources for the history in this novel. He manages to take that documentation and create characters that truly come alive. His portrayal of Temujin's mother was excellent. A very minor gripe for me was that Iggulden never tells us when the story is taking place. Looking online, I found that Ghengis Khan lived from 1162 to 1227 A.D. I had no idea that his reign was so recent and I wish Iggulden had included that information in his otherwise excellent afterword. Now, I'm not going to pretend that this is great literature or even a good history. It's neither. However, Genghis Birth of an Empire is a wonderfully entertaining read that also managed to teach me about a piece of history I knew nothing about. ...more Update- I passed this book to one of my employees.

I would have never read this book if it didn't come with a high recommendation from a friend. Her recommendations have all turned out to be terrific reads so I trusted her when she recommended this book. It took me about 100 pages to get into the story. It seemed like a boy's adventure book in the beginning. However, once I was past the initial 100 pages, it was hard to put the book down. Literally, I was walking around my house, holding the book (a hard cover so this was a difficult task) trying to finish just one more page. I can't wait to read book 2. I'm going to give my heart a while to calm itself. The battle scenes are intense but well worth the read! Did I mention wow?

Okay, il lettore non sa come si fanno certe cose, non conosce le tecniche, per\u00f2 sa cosa vuole. Soprattutto un lettore di narrativa di genere. Il lettore di narrativa di genere \u00e8 come il mecenate di un pittore rinascimentale: sa cosa vuole e paga per averlo, poi sta all\u2019artista usare il proprio talento e/o mestiere per produrre l\u2019opera. Prendiamo un lettore di romanzi storici, ad esempio, che \u00e8 il lettore target di questo libro (ogni eventuale riferimento alla sottoscritta \u00e8 voluto). Il lettore di romanzi storici vuole che i grandi avvenimenti del passato che gi\u00e0 conosce gli vengano raccontati con pi\u00f9 intensit\u00e0 e che lo coinvolgano pi\u00f9 di un libro di Jacques Le Goff; vuole che gli venga raccontato un pezzo di Storia di cui non sapeva niente o che non ricordava, un pezzo che pareva insignificante, mentre invece \u00e8 pi\u00f9 avvincente di quanto non sospettasse; vuole che le storie di quei periodi o personaggi di cui si sa pochissimo vengano riempite di vita. Il lettore di historical fiction vuole, possibilmente, una sanguinosa battaglia, uno o due tradimenti, un po\u2019 di vendetta, una buona dose di strategia militare, sottigliezze politiche q.b., e vuole, soprattutto, che i personaggi storici (e quelli di fantasia che si muovono insieme a loro) diventino reali. Quando ha a che fare con Alessandro Magno, Napoleone, Cesare o Gengis Khan, il lettore vuole che il carisma venga fuori dalle pagine come se fosse nebbia che si alza dalla pianura Padana; auspica di trovare un carattere sfaccettato, perch\u00e9 la personalit\u00e0 di uno cos\u00ec deve essere almeno pari a quella del mio gatto. Analizziamo, in questa luce, Il figlio della steppa. I personaggi Il personaggio principale \u00e8 Temujin, signore e signori. Nientepopodimenoch\u00e9 Temujin dei Lupi Blu, un guerriero spietato con una visione del futuro che nessuno ha mai avuto, nemmeno in sogno. Il lettore vuole entrare nella testa di un diciottenne che \u00e8 riuscito a riunire sotto di s\u00e9 tre trib\u00f9 per sconfiggere un\u2019armata nemica. Dovrebbe rifulgere ma, quanto a carattere, il mio gatto se la gioca. Temujin aveva una madre che, scacciata dalla sua trib\u00f9 con 7 figli, \u00e8 riuscita a camparli per anni nella steppa, da sola, con inverni a -20\u00b0. Ma non ci \u00e8 dato modo di godere della sua forza incommensurabile, perch\u00e9 la madre del khan \u00e8 evanescente, prima, e bipolare, poi. L\u2019assurdit\u00e0 del comportamento di Hoelun, la mamma di Temujin, \u00e8 questa: (view spoiler) [Bekter, il primogenito, sottraeva il cibo alla famiglia che rischiava di morire di fame e Temujin per questo l\u2019ha ucciso, ma Hoelun condanna Temujin per aver tolto di mezzo l\u2019adorato Bekter e lo bandisce, salvo accoglierlo quando si ripresenta a lei con del cibo; ma se andiamo a leggere la storia scopriamo che Bekter non era figlio di Hoelun, ma della prima moglie di Yesugei, suo marito: se fosse stato mantenuto questo fatto la rivalit\u00e0 tra Bekter e Temujin sarebbe stata pi\u00f9 comprensibile e Hoelun non avrebbe avuto queste reazioni inconsulte. (hide spoiler) ] Minzione d\u2019onore per la scena in cui Hoelun tenta di mettere pace tra la nuora e il consuocero. Non sto a parlare dell\u2019inconsistenza degli altri personaggi, dei fratelli e della moglie e dei guerrieri, tanto il concetto si \u00e8 capito. Lo stile Pare che le frasi brevi, soggetto+verbo+complemento (ma non pi\u00f9 di due complementi, eh!), siano le preferite di quegli autori che vogliono dare un taglio cinematografico alla narrazione. Il nostro personaggio monta in sella. Sente il fragore degli zoccoli dei cavalli che fanno vibrare il terreno e il cuore gli batte forte per l\u2019eccitazione. Vede il nemico a meno di un miglio, in fondo alla vallata. Incorda l\u2019arco e si assicura di avere la faretra a portata di mano, fissata alla sella. Scorge gli ufficiali che comandano le ali dell\u2019armata e d\u00e0 il segnale di procedere al piccolo galoppo. Di questo passo gli attributi di un lettore di sesso maschile si sono oltremodo appesantiti, stracciati e fatti a brandelli dalla monotonia della narrazione. Vogliamo parlare delle 5 volte, 5 nel volgere di 218 pagine, che leggiamo l\u2019espressione \u201cbruciava come fuoco\u201d e delle altre ripetizioni? Quanta di questa pigrizia lessicale \u00e8 frutto dell\u2019autore e quanta, invece, del traduttore? Non lo sapremo mai, perch\u00e9 non ho nessuna intenzione di rileggermelo in inglese. Il narratore Narratore interno, esterno, onnisciente. Prima persona. Terza persona. Terza persona limitata. Che bella cosa la narratologia. Personalmente, sono una fan della terza persona, con punto di vista limitato a un unico personaggio (oppure uno alla volta) e vorrei provare a convincervi che \u00e8 il modo migliore per narrare una storia. Ma, direte voi, Jane Austen e Tolstoj e Manzoni e... E dai, non scrivevano historical fiction nel XXI secolo. Date retta a me: il narratore onnisciente \u00e8 la morte del romanzo storico. Se state scrivendo dell\u2019ascesa di un condottiero non potete usare un narratore onnisciente che mi dice chi \u00e8 il traditore e perch\u00e9 tradisce; non potete raccontarmi cosa pensa l\u2019eroe durante il banchetto e poi, di colpo, balzare nella testa dell\u2019interlocutore all\u2019altro capo del tavolo per farmi sapere che ha in mente un piano diverso. \u00c8 come se in un romanzo whodunit seguissimo il killer invece che l\u2019investigatore. Lo capite che non va bene? Fabula e intreccio La trama \u00e8 buona (e ci mancherebbe, visto che parliamo di Gengis Khan), ma \u00e8 raccontata male. Questo libro \u00e8 il primo di una serie, quindi dovrebbe gettare le basi, dovrebbe intessere relazioni, armare e addestrare un esercito, mettere su famiglia. Niente di tutto questo.

Treachery abounds, and there are plots within plots that Temujin must navigate in order to avenge his father's death and unite all the warring Mongol tribes into one large tribe that will wipe out the Tartars and send fear into the hearts of the Chin in the east (who have been playing politics and setting the Tartars and Mongols against each other, and pitting the various Mongol tribes against each other in order to keep their borders secure). I am looking forward to getting the other books in this series as they are released. If all history lessons were as entertaining and informative as this book has been, students would never be bored in class. ...more I loved this. This is historical fiction about Genghis Khan.

I wanted to get a writer's impression of what it might have been like for him growing up and I did. Iggulden put plenty of grit and gross stuff into the story and it succeeded in bringing the world of nomadic life on the steppes for me. Guys wiping their swords in shit and stabbing other guys in the stomach, people living for days on mares' blood and milk, dudes on horseback shooting bows with 200-pound pulls with scary accuracy...it's all pretty brutal and visceral and it was a nice change from the usual setting I like with historical fiction (eastern Europe.) The story of Temujin and his family's struggle for survival and revenge on those who betrayed them was the main attraction for me and that was the meat and potatoes of the book, rather than a focus on setting or anything else. As far as the characters go, they were not terribly deep. I liked Borte and Hoelun and rooted for Temujin to claw his way out of the hole he was thrown in but the rest seemed pretty indistinguishable to me. It seemed like at spots Iggulden hinted at deeper characterization but he never made anything of it. Still, the strength of the story made it a strong like for me. The battles were cool and pretty gripping and I got a pretty good taste of what Mongol life might have been like. Based on how much I enjoyed this book I plowed right on into Lords of the Bow . See my review as to how that worked out. ...more I'm glad I was recommended this. I'd never have read it otherwise. For me, there were several ethnographic and historic innacuracies (most especially: what the hell happened to Jamuka, the yang to Chinggis's ying?) but the writing was good enough to keep this from annoying me too much. I understand that I was reading it from a perspective different from that of most readers. Taking it as a story (and not a history lesson) it was very enjoyable and I may recomend it to some of my colleagues. What I'm glad I was recommended this. I'd never have read it otherwise.

I regret not taking some notes to remind myself more of my feelings as I read it (between the field and the 'plane home); I find it hard now to remember precisely what I liked about it other than the general tone. Oh, and, for the record, a Mongolian would never eat \"spiced mutton\".
