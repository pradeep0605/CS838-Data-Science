But Uprooted isn't being released until May, so this is the first Novik review I've posted. Same and not the same, people. Same and not the same. Meet Will Laurence: Laurence is a Captain in the British Navy. He is a perfect gentlemen. He is ostentatiously dull. And while there is significant character growth throughout the book, it is completely in regards to the small-mindedness that comes with his gentleman status, having no impact whatsoever on the dull, dull, dullness of his disposition. And maybe this is irrelevant, and maybe it isn't. I don't know. What I do know is that b/c I have James Norrington in my head, every time Laurence is on the page--and that's pretty much all the time--all I can think is: Why on earth would you write a Norrington-like character, when you could write a Will Turner : or Jack Sparrow : type character instead? Especially, when the Norrington-type character has a DRAGON? B/c really ? What would Norrington do with a dragon? Funnily enough, I now feel qualified to answer that question: not much. That's not to say it didn't have its moments. Obviously, it did. B/c dragon. <---C>Temeraire</---C> was probably my favorite part of the book. BUT. I couldn\u2019t completely enjoy his character, b/c Novik states early on that Chinese dragons are bred for intelligence, and after establishing that fact, uses him to spout insightful and ahead-of-his-time political ideals. BUT. For an \"insightful\" character to be perceived as insightful (<---B>for me, anyway</---B>), he needs to be spouting universal truths, timeless wisdoms, or exposing easily overlooked, but once pointed out, clear flaws in a majority mindset. All Temeraire does is say things like: \"Some of the laws which I have heard make very little sense, and I do not know that I would obey them if it were not to oblige you. It seems to me that if you wish to apply laws to us, it were only reasonable to consult us on them, and from what you have read to me about Parliament, I do not think any dragons are invited to go there.\" Which, yes , is amusing, but not particularly clever. I also enjoyed Laurence\u2019s pragmatic observations, which were quietly humorous and made me snicker at regular intervals. Like when it\u2019s discovered that the dragon egg they acquired will hatch before reaching land and one of the crew will have to bond with the hatchling, meaning that he'll be forced to leave the respectable Navy to join the disreputable Dragon Aviators. Laurence is determined\u2014as any gentleman would be\u2014to proceed in all fairness: . . . though if Fanshawe had not spoken in so unbecoming a way, Laurence would have liked to keep Carver out of it, as he knew the boy had a poor head for heights, which struck him as a grave impediment for an aviator. *snickers* But regular though those intervals were, they were not enough to overwhelm the blah. Most of the blah was the result of Laurence's stodginess, but while it's one thing to accurately reflect the attitudes of the period in which a book is set, it's quite another to tacitly endorse them: (view spoiler) [ \"Laurence bowed to them both, though he had a sense of awkwardness for the first occasion since he had grown used to Harcourt. She was leaning with no appearance of consciousness against Choiseul's shoulder, and he was looking down at her with undisguised warmth; she was quite young, after all, and Laurence could not help feeling the absence of any suitable chaperone.\" She was young. And in need. Of a chaperone. *flares nostrils* The suggestion is bad enough, but when Harcourt was indeed taken advantage of by the dastardly Choiseul, thus justifying Laurence's backward thinking . . . *frowns* (hide spoiler) ] I also found it difficult to believe that a man so distraught over the inability to pursue elements essential to his own happiness--like a wife, children, and a quiet life in the country--after becoming saddled with a dragon, could transition into his new life so completely, even going so far as to compare overzealously praising Temeraire to the exasperating drivel spewed from men too enamored of their own relations: With difficulty he restrained himself from boasting further; nothing, he was sure, could be more irritating, like one of those men who could not stop talking of the beauty of their mistress, or the cleverness of their children. Then there were the inconsistencies. Like how Temeraire's egg managed to survive aboard a cold, damp boat for a month or more and afterwards being told that the dragon eggs are kept in the hottest part of the training facility's Roman baths, b/c the female dragons have neither the time nor inclination to sit on them until they hatch, and they can't be buried in the hot ash at the base of a volcano, b/c no volcanoes. *sighs* I heard a sermon once where the pastor quoted something about the saints crying out, \"How long?\" in reference to church-services-that-never-end and it was both shocking and hilarious enough to stick with me. And when I found myself crying out, \u201cHow long?\u201d several times while reading His Majesty\u2019s Dragon , I was surprised b/c it\u2019s not a particularly lengthy book. But by golly, it felt like it was. SO. If you like novels of manners, the Napoleonic Wars, and dragons, then by all means, read this book. I am a lone quantity. Everyone else seems to LOVE His Majesty's Dragon , it won all kinds of awards, and even I will admit that it is incredibly well written. Novik is a superb method writer, if there is such a thing. HOWEVER . . . if you aren't crazy about the idea of a gentlemanly account of said war, but think it might be okay b/c DRAGONS . . . I strongly suggest that you are mistaken.

Well, life as he knew it was over as he was going to have to leave the Navy and train with the Aerial Corps. They ride dragons and have a crew on the dragon with you and fight the enemy. Oh what joy! I loved all of the dragons in the book and there were several of the men and women I loved too. I mean this is just an awesome book full of wonderful people and dragons. Well, there was this one ole bastard named Rankin and he treated his little dragon Levitas horribly! I hated him and I felt so sorry for Levitas. Laurence started doing nice things for the little dragon and it was so sweet. Oh, oh and the dragons talk! For the love of all that's holy, I want a talking dragon! I wish my dog could talk too but then they both would probably drive me crazy, but I digress! Anyway, most of the book is about training Laurence and Temeraire with the other dragons and captains but it was so much fun. There are a few battles they get into a little later but setting up this world was so freaking awesome. I have never had so much fun. I mean talking dragons, how could you not love it. The camaraderie between the humans, dragons and other humans were amaze balls. This book has went on my favorites list and I sooooooo look forward to the rest of the books!

I don't love this book because it's perfect in every way - indeed, some I wasn't expecting much when I picked up His Majesty's Dragon. To tell the truth, if I'd seen it in a bookstore, I wouldn't have picked it up. But it was recommended to me by a reliable source as a better alternative to Eragon, and it was a historical fantasy set during the Napoleonic Wars. I figured I'd give it a try. I didn't regret it. I don't love this book because Naomi Novik's writing style is equal to that of Tolkien. I don't love this book because it's perfect in every way - indeed, some of the subplots were rather weak, and should have been changed or cut out altogether. Rather, I love this book because Naomi Novik took a boring, cliche idea, and put on a spin on it that's so brilliant and yet mind-bogglingly obvious I have to wonder why in the world someone hadn't thought of it before. In all of the previous dragonrider books I'd read, there was always one rider. One lone human on a dragon the size of a house. And somehow, that was supposed to be special and sensible and realistic. But no - if a dragon is that large, then why is there only one rider? Why can't there be more? Having one rider on a dragon is like putting one passenger on a plane that could potentially carry fifty. And that's where Naomi Novik takes the Temeraire series. Her fight scenes aren't one-on-one affairs, they're all-out aerial battles fought with crew members dangling precariously from leather harnesses, forced to make the best of inaccurate rifles. It's true, the captain has a special relationship with his or her dragon, but there's the distinct feeling of a team - that the captain would really be nowhere without the support of a crew behind him. What's more, Novik makes the battles work - they're clearly planned out and make sense in a historical context. The main characters are also unusually engaging - Laurence, as a former naval captain who accidentally stumbles upon a dragon egg, is plunged into a branch of the military completely unlike the one in which he's served, and his confusion and stiffness are only to be expected. While his stubbornness and sense of propriety are on occasion mildly irritating, his reactions to elements of the Aerial Corps are only natural given his character. And Temeraire, the dragon that hatches from the egg Laurence discovers, is more than a mere sentient ship - his naive, inquisitive personality is adorably appealing, and the political views he develops at times contrast sharply with those of Laurence. And then there's the matter of the main villain - there is none. There's no evil overlord to face, no Dark Lord Napoleon who tries to foil Laurence's and Temeraire's plans at every turn. In fact, despite the fact that the book is from a strictly British point of view, Novik portrays Napoleon fairly, and his character only grows more sympathetic as the series goes on. Napoleon doesn't even make an appearance during the first book - it's just the British Aerial Corps versus the French Armee de l'Air. It's a lovely change; as the battles grow steadily more climactic, one gets the feeling that they're in a war against other dragon-crews just like theirs, not fighting some unseen maniac. Like I said, His Majesty's Dragon isn't perfect. The subplot with Choiseul is ultimately disappointing in its resolution, and Laurence's love interest is perilously close to a Mary-Sue and should have been cut (thankfully, there's a lot less of her in the following books). Still, it's a refreshingly original spin on an overused idea, and all in all a very good read. ...more 4.5 stars! This book is so utterly delightful in every way. I can't even count how many times it made me smile or laugh, or how it tugged at my heartstrings. The bond between Laurence and Temeraire is incomparable.

Besides, it's not like this is me cooing and getting the fuzzies over a bunch of cute babies. We're talking about dragons here, people! Wanna know why I'm all smitten and stuff? Mostly because this book reminded me of Pete's Dragon \u2190 I think I just lost half of the people reading this review. Don't worry kids, this is too ancient for you to know about. Besides, it's not your fault you were born two decades too late (view spoiler) [It does explain why you're all so screwed up, though (hide spoiler) ] . So this is a story about a boy man and his dragon. And this isn't typically the kind of book I enjoy reading because, let's be honest, there isn't much of a plot here. But the relationship between Laurence and his dragon Temeraire? It's everything. It's cute beyond measure . I know, I know, I just used the word cute *shudders* to describe the relationship between a grown man and a dragon. You can snicker all you want, I don't care. Because these two? They make me all tingly inside . Yes they do. I LOVE their conversations (yes, dragons do talk). I LOVE their interactions. I LOVE how much they care for each other. And I pretty much melt every time Laurence reads to Temeraire at night \u2190 Damn. Either I'm getting really soft in my old age or Naomi Novik is a miracle worker. Anyhow, Laurence and Temeraire are so perfect for each other I think they should get married . Or something. Okay, I have to admit Laurence could have been a bit more dashing. Strike that, he could have been a lot more dashing. But I still like him. He is nice, reliable, honourable and fair *shudders* But I still like him . I can't believe I'm actually admitting my utter fondness for a non-assholish male lead *gasps* Prepare to die everyone, the end of the world is near. Chaos, doom and destruction await . Now for the other half of our perfect couple : Temeraire. Sigh. I think I just fell in love with a dragon. I love his ever-innovative ideas about politics, his very fresh point of view and his insightful comments . His lines just crack me up. Besides, he loves being read French books on mathematics and physics, how can anyone resist that?! There are some very cool dragons in this book, but Temeraire here is definitely my kind of monster . Now some people find that this book is slow paced. It is in a sense because there isn't that much action. Novik dedicates a large chunk of the book to the training of Laurence and Temeraire in the Dragon Corps. I (very uncharacteristically) enjoyed every minute of it but I understand that other might find it a bit boring. There is some pretty great naval action in the opening chapters though, and the aerial fight sequences in the second half of the book were simply amazing . Aerial fights, people! That means crazy aerial maneuvers! That means dragons being used as ships, with a full crew riding them! Napoleonic wars, people! That means strategy! That means Admiral Nelson! That means war with the Filthy, Cunning French! Woo hoo! I used to binge-read historical fiction but stopped after OD'ing on the genre a few years ago. I'm finding it surprisingly refreshing now that I'm on the verge of OD'ing on Urban Fantasy, haha. I really enjoyed the Regency setting here and love the way Novik mixes history, fantasy and comedy of manners . This improbable mix of dragons, Napoleonic wars and light social satire works because Novik is a fantastic writer. Her style is flawless and everything blends in together effortlessly . And the characters! I love the way she writes her characters! Actually, I was so impressed with Novik's writing and enjoyed it so much that I added Uprooted to my tbr. And you know what? Uprooted is YA . Yes, His Majesty's Dragon is SO AWESOME that it made me want to read a Freaking YA Book. Now what do you think about that?! \u25ba Now for the moral of this review : His Majesty's Dragon is fun. His Majesty's Dragon is entertaining. His Majesty's Dragon is great. His Majesty's Dragon is OMG-I can't-stop-reading . His Majesty's Dragon might not make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside like it did me but it will definitely make you forget about the outside world for a while. What more do you want?! PS: there might not be many female characters in this story but they're all very cool, as in unconventional for the time period and acting quite inappropriately. YES! I can't wait to read more about them in the next instalments. PPS: kudos to Novik for writing whole sentences in French without a single spelling or grammar mistake .

First, I've read lots of \"dragon books\", and this is far, far from the best. For one thing, I'm a physicist and while I'm willing to suspend disbelief up to a certain point, the image of dragons capable of carrying anywhere from tens to hundreds of humans at a time (plus weapons and armor!) for distances that again range from tens to hundreds of miles in a day just does not compute.

For one thing, I'm a physicist and while I'm willing to suspend disbelief up to a certain point, the image of dragons capable of carrying anywhere from tens to hundreds of humans at a time (plus weapons and armor!) for distances that again range from tens to hundreds of miles in a day just does not compute. Let me count the ways it violates natural law, not just by a little bit but ludicrously: energy conservation, scaling laws, biology -- you name it, her dragons violate it. Her dragons carry loads like 747 airliners carry loads -- to carry the load described in the last book of this series, where Temeraire helps ferry people over a hundred at a time from a fort out to a boat, well -- imagine hanging 100 people from an elephant. Hmmm, no way. A brachiosaurus? Sorry, I can't imagine more than 30 or 40. A blue whale? Now we're talking. 100 humans at 200 pounds each is an easy 10 tons of humans. Add this to the (conservatively) 100 ton body mass of an animal large enough to hang all these people on and you're talking the good sized airliner, all supposedly powered by muscles on the fuel of the energy content of an occassional cow. Waste heat alone would cook such a beast until it starved to death, assuming of course that they weren't crushed under their own weight as they attempted to stand. Okay , you say. We know dragons aren't real, so why can't they be whatever she likes? They can, of course, but even my 12 year old thought that it was a bit odd and hard to believe. And it's not that I don't like dragons. McCaffery's dragons are close enough that I can suspend disbelief -- Pern's gravity is lower, air is maybe thicker, they're hollow bodied and don't have to carry huge loads, just a person and saddle and load of firestone, which (for all I know) is a light and porous rock or the dragons couldn't chew it. Battledragons are also believable -- basically smallish dinosaurs in armor who like noodles as much as meat. One can go down a veritable list of dragons back to King Arthur, and never has their been a storybook dragon so very out of kilter with common sense. Once you get past this, the book is still flawed in several ways. Laurence (the main human protagonist) is a middling flawed individual -- priggish, filled with notions of duty and obligation, blind to his surroundings, out of touch with the real world, a supposedly \"romantic\" character that comes across looking more foolish than believable. He persists in referring to his (male) dragon as \"dear\" throughout the book. No man calls his male companions or pets (however you want to view the dragon) as \"dear\", and even viewing the dragon as his \"child\" it still sounds odd. Because he's a dodo-brain when it comes to politics he naturally gets into all sorts of scrapes that could easily be avoided, which gives the book a bit of stilted or contrived feel. Even the economics of dragons doesn't really compute -- at a good sized piece of livestock a day, dragons are remarkably expensive to feed (a cow takes months to years to grow and can feed a lot of humans). Yet we see dragons by the dozen being supported for their military potential, we see dragons \"making a living\" carrying messages or people around a city. Hell of a taxi service, if the taxi driver/cab combo earns enough to buy an entire cow a day. Given all of this, if you accept the series as being a simple historical \"what-if\" novel exploring the Napoleanic wars with dragons being used as a living \"air force\", it's a decent read. Worth it for exactly three novels, which unfortunately wasn't enough to get close to terminating the endless story. I will not buy any more. ...more As there are many great reviews for this already that really pinpoint the good and the bad of this book, I shall allow myself a lazy review.

His Majesty\u2019s Dragon is an alternate history where Dragons are present and used in the warfare of the Napoleonic Wars like battleships would be. It is a really interesting concept and the writing is almost as good as Uprooted. Laurence has been a navy man and ship captain most of his life but when some unexpected loot from a French ship ends up being a dragon egg he is cast into role of rider to a new hatchling dragon and the life he thought he would have is now over. I was entertained by learning what it takes to raise a dragon and see how they are incorporated into society and warfare. It was different than I expected as Dragons are pretty sentient and can speak right out of the shell. I also didn\u2019t expect the unique relationship between rider and dragon. Sometimes they spoke to each other almost like a couple. While a little strange I did like the strong bound that formed between a Dragon and the Rider they chose at hatching. Not a lot happens in the actual plot. There is a lot of training and Laurence getting used to how different the Arial Force is from the Navy. First of all there are women riders which is a huge change from the life he lived before. Most of this story is the life of having a Dragon and what it entails. There are a few battles and some tense moments but for the most part it is a story of a boy and his dragon. Laurence is a bit stiff but it fits with the timeframe of the book and since he is English. I did want him to loosen up a bit more. Temeraire on the other hand is so obviously loyal to Laurence and pretty charming that he made the book all that more enjoyable for me. If you haven\u2019t read a Naomi Novak book yet I still say go with Uprooted first but she has a great writing style that can bring you into a new world and keep you there easily. ...more I'm amazed at how many people enjoyed this book.

In fact, everything is so well thought out and meticulously detailed that it's now hard to imagine dragons NOT being involved in these great historical battles. One of the greatest things about this book, and those that follow, is the fact that dragons aren't \"all powerful\". They have been bred to be specialists, and within their specialized roles they excel, but outside of that narrow scope they struggle. Most can\u2019t see in the dark, young dragons are prone to panic or overzealousness, and they are all susceptible to the muskets and cannons (and other dragons) of the time period. They are not \u201csuper\u201d weapons\u2026they are aerial assets that have to be used carefully and tactically. Aside from that, though, is the fact that they are also creatures who think and feel, and don\u2019t always agree with the rules and laws of the military they \u201cserve\u201d. Our protagonist, Captain William Laurence, is very much a man of his time. Born into some privilege, he is an officer and a gentleman through and through, with duty to King & Country coming before anything else. He reminds me very much of Captain Jack Aubrey from the O\u2019Brian books, in that he is singularly devoted to his service in His Majesty\u2019s military, with everything else in life being an ancillary thought. If the entire book had him this uptight, we\u2019d have been in for a rough ride. But once he and Temeraire are paired, he starts to open up, as the more \u201cprogressive\u201d leanings of his dragon start to take hold in his own heart and mind. As for Temeraire, he is just as fleshed out a character as Laurence, even if we don\u2019t get chapters expressly from his point of view. He is young, impulsive, and marveled by the world in which he was hatched. With his inquisitive nature, natural rebelliousness, and disdain for useless rules, he is the perfect foil to Captain Laurence\u2019s stiff upper lip upbringing. They are such a fantastic team that they could easily carry the book by themselves. Fortunately, there are plenty of supporting characters who are also colorful and well thought out, which help broaden the strokes of the story even more. The less said about them the better though, as there are some conflicts and revelations best left unspoiled to new readers. There\u2019s quite a bit of technical descriptions thrown about in these books, but Naomi Novik writes in such a way that it never becomes cumbersome or confusing. The sea and air battles are handled with amazing flair, and the vernacular of the time is spot on (and also used in a way that the meaning is conveyed, even if the word may not be known to our modern minds). So much happens on these pages, that it sometimes feels like the book should be more pages than it is. So yeah, shame on me for rating it so low from my first read through. I enjoyed it so much that it\u2019s easily a 4 star read, maybe even rounded up to 4.5 stars. Now, onwards to the book # 2! ...more I am a little surprised by how much I liked this. The idea of the Napoleonic Wars with dragons seemed like something that could be either very good or very bad, and I've read enough overwrought fantasy the last little while (as well as some very good fantasy) that I was a little wary.

Anyway, it's the story of Captain Mary Sue of the Royal Navy who happens to capture a dragon egg from the French right before it hatches, and as luck would have it, the Mary Sue dragon who hatches is totally and completely going to only bond with him. Dragons hatch fully able to speak and comprehend languages, you see, and reach their full growth in weeks. Also the bond between dragon and rider is the bestest and most truest and most wonderful bond possible. Captain Mary Sue calls Dragon Mary Sue \"my dear\" and \"darling\" throughout, and prefers sleeping cuddled up with his dragon, and they have long talks and he reads to him, and it's OH SO WONDERFUL. And dragons are just like people, really, so there's never any sense of two intelligences who are actually alien to one another at a fundamental level communicating because the dragon and rider bond transcends that in its love and friendship and loyalty, except for one dragon rider, he's a BAD one, he treats his dragon BADLY and then his dragon DIES and Captain Mary Sue forces him to at least fake affection because all that poor dragon wanted was his LOVE, and Captain Mary Sue is a hero because he refrained from hurting the bad bad dragon rider, and everyone approves because they all understand how pure and good the dragon bond is, and it's such a terrible and tragic shame about that one guy. Everyone's sad but it's okay because Captain Mary Sue and Dragon Mary Sue can comfort each other and feel better. Oh oh oh! And Dragon Mary Sue isn't just any dragon, he's the BEST DRAGON IN THE WORLD! He was brought all the way from CHINA, and he's CELESTIAL! He's BIG, but ever so NIMBLE and BEAUTIFUL! He can do things like turn on a dime and hover in place, which the other dragons can't do. It's not that the other dragons are bad dragons, but they're just not THE BEST DRAGON IN THE WORLD like Dragon Mary Sue is, and Dragon Mary Sue is a little bit sad at first because he can't breathe fire or acid like other dragons can, and maybe that means he's not the very bestest dragon in all the world, but that's OKAY, because in the end, do you know what happens? Oh squee, it turns out he can ROAR with such brave strong FORCE that it's like a shockwave, and it SAVES EVERYONE! Everyone already knew Captain Mary Sue and Dragon Mary Sue were so awesome, but now they know it even more! And there's TWO WHOLE MORE BOOKS I could get, too! Could the BEST DRAGON IN THE WORLD get even MORE BESTEST?!?! I'll never know. ...more I read this book within a day and it was a day where I have been feeling really ill and unwell and this book helped cheer me up.

This story follows a young man called Lawrence who is a Navy Captain. He's earned his rank for service to the crown and he's proud of where he's got without much family help. One day he and his crew take the cargo from a rival French ship they capture and on board they find a dragon egg near to hatching. When this egg does indeed hatch no one knows the dragon's breed, but it takes a liking to Lawrence and from then on the course of his life shifts far from what he had anticipated... What I most loved about this was that Temeraire (the dragon) was sentient and intelligent and filled with personality. I loved seeing Temeraire's inquisitive nature come out, and the bond he formed with Lawrence over the course of just this one book was really lovely. I don't doubt that this will just continue as the series goes on, and I am looking forward to it. My only complaint is that I'm not hugely interested in the Napoleonic wars which is the back drop for this series and so some of the tactics weren't all that interesting to me, but as a story this worked well. I do think this has a lot of potential and with the addition of some more unusual or unexpected plot points and some more lyrical writing I could see this series becoming a favourite.

A friend recommended the Temeraire series, and it was the biggest favour he's ever done me, then or since. Sometimes when I re-read books that I read a long time ago, I find myself losing interest. One of the sad/good things about growing up is that you're more critical and less accepting of flights of fancy, let's say. So while my teenage self thought The Princess Diaries was the coolest thing to happen to YA fiction, my adult self gets pretty damn tired of her self-involved babbling. And don't even get me started on the then vs. now of Enid Blyton's books. But thankfully, the magic of His Majesty's Dragon has not faded. I find that I am still as touched and amused by the relationship between Laurence and Temeraire as I ever was. If you've been living in Siberia, and don't know what this book is about, it's an alternative history/historical fantasy set in the Napoleonic era. The war between Britain and France is being fought, with dragons in the fray. SO when Navy captain Will Laurence captures a French frigate and discovers an unusual egg, it is cause for celebration. Not for long, however. En route to Madeira, the egg hatches, and the dragonet forms a bond with Laurence, hitherto a career Navy man. Leaving behind all that he knows, Laurence sets off with his dragon, Temeraire to enter the new world of the aviators, those mysterious group of dragon handlers. Watching the bond develop between Laurence and Temeraire is a little like a love story, except then it'll be bestiality, so ew, definitely not! Maybe the start of a beautiful friendship, then. Laurence is at first distressed about leaving all that he knows and values, but gradually, his affection for Temeraire and respect for the dragon's intelligence grows, until he cannot bear to be separated from the creature who has become his best friend. I love Naomi Novik's writing. Her characterisations are authentic, and as someone who is a little bit of a Regency freak (no, I don't mean I read a lot of Georgette Heyer, although there is that too!) I know that she's really made an effort to research her history, customs, language, military data, etc. There are some inconsistencies that crop up, but I'll let her get away with it in the name of Art. Will is adorable as the stuffed shirt who eventually unbends, but it is not he that makes the series. It is, completely and totally, from the first book to the sixth, thus far, Temeraire who is the heart and soul of the story. He grows from the first book, where one tends to think of him as a fascinating, amusing, sort-of pet into a thinking, growing person in his own right, with opinions and quirks, until by the sixth book, he's just like a man on four legs. Although that would probably be something of an insult to a dragon. And it's not just Laurence and Temeraire who are likeable in this book. Despite a sad lack of page-time, I also fell in love with the relationship between Maximus and Berkely, and found myself blubbering in incoherent rage over Rankin's treatment of his dragon. I really, really, empathised with the characters and the storyline, even the second time around, which is saying a lot for the adult, newly-picky version of moi. I cannot recommend HMD and the rest of the series enough. If you're the kind of person who isn't entirely comfortable with the slightly long-winded modes of speech of Georgian and Regency England, you may find some parts of the story hard going, but if you persist, it's totally worth it. I. Love. This. Book. ...more It took me a long time to get around to reading this, which is a shame, because it\u2019s delightful.

Dragons here are essentially flying, talking ships, which makes for some entertaining battle scenes and opens up room for an imaginative alternate world. The plot is entertaining--not action-packed: there\u2019s a lot of training, and a lot about Laurence\u2019s adjustment to the Aerial Corps, which is much more casual and modern than he\u2019s used to (there are even *gasp* women in it!)--but fun; I was rooting for Laurence and his dragon, Temeraire, and enjoyed the story throughout. The characters are vivid and interesting, and I especially enjoyed Laurence\u2019s struggle to adjust and the conflict between his respect for hierarchy and his discomfort with some of the ways things are done in the Corps. Creating such a stiff and formal protagonist is a risk, but Laurence works because at the same time he\u2019s good-hearted and willing to adapt. Temeraire is also entertaining, breaking the typical dragon-companion mold (he likes books, for instance), and he manages not to come across as a animal-companion wish-fulfillment fantasy, which is rare in this sort of book. I\u2019ve read comments indicating there\u2019s a lot of romance in the book, which baffle me--there isn\u2019t, at least not in the sexual sense; the growing friendship between Laurence and Temeraire is at the heart of the story. Laurence\u2019s apparent love interest is awesome, though, and I\u2019d love to see more of her in future books. Otherwise, the writing is good, the period details convincing and the fantasy elements well-integrated into the historical setting. Novik\u2019s style hints at 19th century writing, while still being easy going for the modern reader. The secondary characters are endearing or obnoxious as the author intended, and feel real enough to set them apart from the typical fantasy extras. And Novik manages a modern, critical look at the British Empire without Laurence\u2019s ever breaking character; he\u2019s unthinkingly loyal, even while the narrative questions that devotion. Really, there\u2019s no downside here, unless you\u2019re leery of starting a long and unfinished series. But while there seem to be some long-running threads introduced (Laurence\u2019s relationship with his father, for one), the book works well as a standalone. This isn\u2019t great literature, and I don\u2019t expect to read it again. But I do intend to read the sequel, and I recommend this one to anyone looking for fun, high-quality fantasy. UPDATE: I read most of the sequel and found it boring as hell, so for me the series ends here. This doesn't affect my recommendation of this one, though. ...more 4.5 to 5.0 stars. Outstanding beginning to what looks like a great series. Excellent back story/ world-building making the presence of Dragons in the time of Napoleon seem very realistic.

Dragons fighting in the Napoleonic Wars - I was reluctant to read it at first, thinking it would be heavy on the military aspect. But when it was nominated for a Compton Crook, I picked it up and was surprised. The war is a part of the setting and plot, but the characters are the stars of the show. Both Lawrence and his dragon. PS: Naomi won the Compton Crook. I really enjoyed this. I only took a star off because I felt like there wasn't enough story to it. Interestingly, that is sort of how I felt about Uprooted. It could certainly be that I am blinded by how brilliantly Naomi writes her characters, that I miss the actual plot. I don't know. I need to think about it. Naomi Novik's Temeraire books are set in an alternate reality in which dragons are found around the world, are intelligent and have allowed themselves to be linked to a rider. Set during the Napoleonic Wars the drgaons are, at this point, recruited by both sides as an Air Force changing the way the war actually went by adding in an extra element.

It was more a case of bad timing when I picked it up, too much going on and not enough time or energy to spare and all that, but I made it through, with a lot of help from the audiobook which was superbly read by Mr. Vance, and I really enjoyed it. The story reimagines the Napoleonic War years from the perspective of Will Laurence, an English captain, formerly of the navy, currently of the air force, and the dragon Temeraire which he took from a captured French ship. The pair bonded over a short period of time and grew to become a funny, sweet, interesting partnership by the end of the book. Some of my favorite moments consist of Laurence and Temeraire talking about books, battle tactics and strategies. There's no magic or magic systems, no mysterious relics or quests, no coming of age farmboy stories since this isn't high fantasy; dragons are the only fantastical elements here. And the dragons in this world are intelligent and can communicate with their handlers and crew, and their interactions are really fun to read, or more accurately, really fun to hear Simon Vance read because he's got a lovely voice and he has different voices for all of the characters, but the dragons' voices are by far the best. The historical aspects of the story are well done and really immerse you in the time period, save for the part where there were dragons involved and both England and France used them like fighter jets, intelligent fighter jets with personalities and quirks. But this too, inserting dragons into this part of history, was also well done and really added to the overall historical feel of the story. Another break from history is the inclusion of (view spoiler) [women in the air force. The reason for that is simply because of dragons again, but this time, it's because a specific breed of dragons, the Longwings, only accept women handlers as their captains, and so His Majesty's air force had no choice but to recruit women. Again, I like how this was worked into the narrative. Though sadly, once this was revealed to Laurence half-way into the story, it \"explained\" why the air force was looked down upon by other branches of military and why Laurence was reluctant at first to join the air force, seeing it as a huge step down from his lofty place as naval captain, although he hadn't known about women in the air force. (hide spoiler) ] The reason I switched to audio was because of the slow beginning. Not much happened following the capture of the French ship as Laurence and his crew waited for Temeraire to hatch, and not much happened afterward when they left the navy to join the air force. While Temeraire was interesting, Laurence was not, unfortunately. Although a captain and in his thirties, he still had a lot of growing up to do and a lot of personal obstacles to overcome, and he didn't become interesting until he fully gave in to the life and culture of the air force and dedicate himself to Temeraire (and dragons in general). By this point, more than half the book was over, and without Mr. Vance's reading, I most definitely wouldn't have made it this far or past all of Laurence's shortcomings to really get into the story. I've only read one other book by Naomi Novik and that's Uprooted which was mostly okay, so I went into this book expecting it to also be mostly okay, but found myself enjoying it a lot, especially once more characters and dragons were introduced. They're all a lot of fun (view spoiler) [except for Rankin whom I'd like to stab but that's another matter, unfinished business, saved for another time (hide spoiler) ] , and since there are 8 more books of dragons and adventures, I look forward to continuing this journey with them. \u201cI should rather have you than a heap of gold, even if it were very comfortable to sleep on.\u201d Also posted at https://covers2covers.wordpress.com/2... ...more His Majesty\u2019s Dragon is a historical fantasy set during the Napoleonic wars in the early 1800s.

They have entire units of them to supplement naval battles. They are not a rarity that gives one side a huge advantage over the other, so the war is pretty much the same, just with dragons as an added factor. Captain Laurence is a naval officer who finds himself attached to a dragon and having to give up his naval life for a life in the dragon corps. A lot of time in this first book is spent on him and Temeraire training together and learning about aerial maneuvers and battle strategy. They do get to see some real action later in the book, but it takes a while to build up to. Some people might find it slow-moving, but I really enjoyed the pace and getting to know the culture of the dragon corps in training mode. The dragons are used in much the same way as ships, with rigging and harnesses that host an entire crew for shooting at other dragons. I really felt like I was reading about naval battles, just in the air and with a ship that can think and act for itself. One thing I should mention is that although this is a Regency era novel, there are not many women at all. It is not a Jane Austen-esque novel, but focuses more on the men (and yes, a couple of non-typical women) in the military and their concerns. There is the typical era stuffiness about manners and etiquette - who can talk first at the dinner table, etc - but without the courtship aspect that many Regency readers are familiar with and may be wishing for. Captain Laurence is one of these stiff, very correct and honorable men, but unlike with his naval experience, his new aerial unit does not \u201cstand on ceremony\u201d and he has to learn that ceremony is ridiculous sometimes. I like this angle that critiques the culture of the time, showing how over-politeness can be a hindrance to sincerity and truth. The women that do exist in the book are not at all the genteel types that Laurence is used to, which also challenges his concept of what is acceptable. I love that the story takes a typical Regency captain out of his element and gives him a unique view of his own society that he can\u2019t help but begin to criticize. He begins to realize there\u2019s a difference between affecting manners and true honor. As he questions the norms, he brings the parts that do make sense with him into the dragon corps and sparks changes there. The main thrust of the story plot-wise is the friendship that develops between Laurence and Temeraire as they train for active service. Dragons occupy a low place in this society, and are not respected as sentient beings. They\u2019re treated more as animals - like a horse that needs to be trained and cared for, but never gets brushed down or has its saddle removed. But as the captain gets to know his dragon, he begins to question that aspect of his own society as well. The dragons have wonderful personalities, some of them very intelligent, and the way the humans treat them ends up making them look like animals instead. All-in-all, I really enjoyed this. I love books set in this time period, though, and am partial to Comedy of Manners as well as Fantasy genres. The combination of the two here is a definite win for me, especially with the satirical critiques of the society. I found the lack of domestic concerns a refreshing change from the usual novels of the period, and didn't even mind the lack of magic, which is usually a 'must' for me in Fantasy. The 9th and final book in the series is due in 2015, and I\u2019ll be slowly making my way there whenever I get a hankering for this very particular flavor. ...more In this alternate reality series, the napoleonic era is enrichened by dragons.

This book has some really good parts, which I enjoyed a lot. The relationship between Laurence and Temeraire is really great and the book has several \"Awwww\" moments, where young Temerarire is especially cute, if you're into that sort of thing. The second really strong part is the world-building. On the one hand, Novik pictures a really believeable napoleonic world. The language and the habits of the people seem apropriate and you can see that she put a lot of work into the history. From that point she does a great job in showing how the inclusion of dragons and aerial combat would fit into warfare. Dragons are really huge in her world and don't have a single dragon rider. Every dragon is manned by an entire crew with top- and bottom-men, gunners, flag messengers and a ground crew. Nonetheless, the whole maneuvering in the sky with boarding parties etc. didn't really work for me. At some points I couldn't really follow how the soldiers are doing all the things they're doing while being harnessed to the dragon in a rather complicated carabiner based system. That had the effect that I started to glance of, when the maneuver or fighting scenes went on for too long. And as interesting and sweet as the scenes are, where dragons are involved, I didn't really click with the scenes without them. The really stiff navy way of Laurence made him a well developed character, but reading about him was a bit boring at some points. Nonetheless, His Majesty's Dragon was a very enjoyable read for me and I'm definately going to revisit the series, as I saw that Novik is going to show us a lot of different parts of her dragon infested flintlock world. The 3 stars are very strong 3 stars, almost 4, but in comparism to other books I rated 4 stars, the novel was not just there yet for me. ...more Dragoni.
