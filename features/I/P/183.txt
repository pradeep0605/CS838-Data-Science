{"Comments": "Well, it's mine....so, er...<---F>yeah, a little biased</---F>. :) Shameless. I know, I know! A little while ago I was cleaning all the dust and papers and shit out from under my bed, and I found a plastic box full of last year's Christmas presents and decs. You all know how it is. You start off tidying up but then you find something you forgot you had like a Katie Morag book or a recorder and you spend like a half an hour just fucking around with it and by the time you get back down to business, you can't be bothered cleaning any more and it all gets kicked right back under the bed beca A little while ago I was cleaning all the dust and papers and shit out from under my bed, and I found a plastic box full of last year's Christmas presents and decs. You all know how it is. You start off tidying up but then you find something you forgot you had like a Katie Morag book or a recorder and you spend like a half an hour just fucking around with it and by the time you get back down to business, you can't be bothered cleaning any more and it all gets kicked right back under the bed because fuck it - no one's going to look under there . Who cares if it's tidy or not? So I was cleaning up and I found this chocolate Santa still in his foil clothing. I sniffed it to see if it was foosty because let's face it, he'd been languishing in that box all year. But he smelled alright, so I held on to him and started to look through the other stuff. I kind of needed my hands then, so as I was standing over the box, I tucked him between my knees just to avoid placing him on the floor (<---B>because it's covered in dog hair</---B>). I pressed him too hard and crushed one of his arms. So to the ER/kitchen I rushed him, for repair. When I got there, I realized it was too late and decided just to eat him instead of faffing around with the tin foil. So I start to peel off the foil - and what the fuck did I find? I found out that underneath his nice,<---M> shiny PC clothing</---M>, he was in fact a chocolate Pope. A chocolate POPE. Pope's hat, robes, all the bells and whistles. I'm not fucking kidding you. He was a POPE. I screamed and stamped my feet on the floor. Consumerist brainwashing, I declared! Santa is a neutral entity accessible to all, like Switzerland or Dairy Queen! The Pope is not! I was going to eat him just to spite all that, but he didn't taste good. He tasted a year old. He tasted like deceit. You're probably wondering what the hell this has to do with <+++>Legend</+++> . Well, I'll tell you! This book is the EXACT OPPOSITE of a chocolate Pope. This book was like buying a foil Pope, and then opening it up to find a chocolate Santa. Who isn't a Santa at all, but just a casing in which three tickets to Rome are hidden along with a fat lump of gold and an Indigo gift card! I wasn't expecting much from this book. I won't lie. I've read my fair share of shitty YA dystopians. In fact, I've given up on my fair share of shitty YA dystopias. But this! This book made the little crying feminist inside me sob with joy while the little crying writer inside me burned with jealousy that someone else could write something so fabulous! I can't really be bothered to keep on typing, but I'll tell you this: you cannot go wrong here. This book has so many logic farts, but they don't even MATTER. The characters are absolutely incredible, the plot is a freaking rollercoaster ride of excitement and doom, and the writing! Oh, the writing! <---A>Marie Lu</---A>, you are fucking amazing. Maybe it's just personal preference, but the writing in <+++>Legend</+++> is just perfect. It's straight-talking, no fluffy crap but just enough emotion to make me care. And it's present tense! Hurrah, old chaps! Yeah, a shit ton of people really hate present tense, but I love it. Past tense is decent, nothing really wrong with it, but it's more poetic; doesn't have the same immediacy required for a fast-paced action-punch novel like this one. Which is to say: past and present tense each have their respective places. And this book got it right. Ugh! This book! It's just wonderful. Oh, so wonderful. And it made my post-New Year weekus horribilis a hell of a lot better. Ku-dos. Edit : I've read a lot of reviews for this book, and I'm struck by something. Am I the only person who noticed the Tiananmen Square reference in this book? I was waiting to see if anybody else would comment on it, but nobody has. Is it just that nobody noticed it, or does nobody know what I'm talking about? BONUS TIME! Back by popular demand! This BT really has nothing to do with anything, but it's too awesome not to share. You're welcome. ...more I'm such a sucker for dystopians. I love the energy, the rush I get from them. When I got my copy of Legend I was thrilled. Now I know I had a good reason to be. This is one of the good ones. A dystopian well worth reading! We've got two narrators: the notorious criminal, Day, and the noble citizen, though a little rebellious, June. Day has escaped death before, and he's only trying to survive while taking care of his family, especially his sick brother. June got a perfect score on her Trial and I'm such a sucker for dystopians.

Day has escaped death before, and he's only trying to survive while taking care of his family, especially his sick brother. June got a perfect score on her Trial and she's trying to get revenge for her brother's death. Their paths cross and the story takes hold in the most unprecedented way. I truly enjoyed both of these narrators equally - which rarely happens. They both have great characteristics that make each POV really interesting and addicting. I couldn't wait to find out how their situations would play out. It was brilliant. We go through the story on both sides, night and day, and we're persuaded to root for each of them the all the same. It was original and well thought out. The plot was typical dystopian; the world is completely changed and a new government has taken over, and they may or may not have everyone's best interest at heart *cough*. The reason for the present peril and what happened to the world wasn't explained as much as I would have liked. I hope the next installments discloses more details. We did get enough to still make sense of it and enjoy the story, though. It was fast paced, which is always welcome in this type of book. There were no slow or boring parts, and it also didn't go in the direction I imagined it would. Which is great because it took me off guard and kept me really glued to the story. This is another one not to miss, folks! For more of my reviews, check my blog at Xpresso Reads . ...more Are you kidding me!?!? What just happened?!? This book is ABSOLUTELY UNPUTDOWNABLE !!

Yes, I realize that\u2019s not a word, but I have to admit I\u2019m a bit sleep deprived seeing as I stayed up all night reading this FRICKEN AMAZING book!! Okay let me just tell you now, this review is going to be an absolute, incoherent gush-fest. I haven\u2019t felt this pumped about a YA dystopic novel since the The Hunger Games came to town. Mind you, I\u2019ve read some pretty awesome stories since, such as Divergent , Blood Red Road , and Burn Bright . But when I\u2019m taking this book with me to run errands so I can read in between red lights, I know something fantastical is going on, and there\u2019s no way in HALE I\u2019m stopping! GIVE.ME.MORE.NOW.P.L.E.A.S.E! Marie Lu has created a book where the voices are powerful, the narrative is commanding, and the plot is explosive\u2026 all the way to the absolute end. Legend has shot up to my top spot in highly addictive series. This book was nothing short of riveting making it worthy of applause, standing ovations and literary accolades. I\u2019m giving it everything I\u2019ve got! I anticipate this novel getting some well deserved buzz, and I can\u2019t wait to see how it all plays out. E.X.C.I.T.E.M.E.N.T.! ~okay breathe~ With Lu\u2019s debut novel, she\u2019s created this moment in time, over 100 years into the future, where the United States has split between the Colonies and the Republic and natural disasters have drastically changed the landscape of California and its surrounding states. Plagues are diminishing the population; and two sides of what was once one country are fighting each other using biological warfare, lies and anything and everything in their arsenal for land and power. This story is told in alternating POVs between Day (Daniel Altan Wing) who is a criminal on the run from the Republic authorities, and <---C>June Iparis</---C> a recent graduate of the Republic academy who is placed on a mission to hunt down Day. When these two characters collide, secrets and conspiracies force them to take a closer look around them to find their true enemy and an all out manhunt explodes. Being from Southern California, it was interesting to experience the setting of the book from an insider\u2019s perspective. I\u2019m very much familiar with Los Angeles and our beloved Public Library. So, to read how the state has changed was pretty captivating. The characters in this book, including Day, June, Tess and Kaede are definitely qualified to pull this series through to the end and I\u2019m curious how the relationships between these four will play out. Lastly, I\u2019ll admit now, that the downfall to reading advanced reader copies well before the release date is that we have to wait even longer for the next installment, but with incredible books such as Legend \u2026 it\u2019s worth the wait. Congrats to Marie Lu for exploding the YA writing scene with a story that\u2019s finally, FINALLY going to give The Hunger Games fans what they\u2019ve been craving. Something amazing! Huge thanks to Flannery from thereadventurer for letting me read her ARC. ~tackle hug~ Thank you! ...more ____________________________________________ \u201cEach day means a new twenty-four hours.

Instead I find myself staring into a pair of oceans - one perfect, the other blemished by that tiny ripple. \"You're very attractive.\" I've been complimented on my appearance before. But never in his tone of voice. Of all the things he's said, I don't know why this catches me off guard. But it startles me so much that without thinking I blurt out, \"I could say the same about you.\" I pause. \"In case you didn't know.\" A slow grin spreads across his face. \"Oh, trust me. I know.\u201d ____________________________________________ The book was badassy greatly thrilly epic .I enjoyed every bit of it.It was also confusing because when I think about the characters,they are only fifteen and they are like Einstein smart and Bruce Lee strong,and when I was their age I didn't even know how to boil an egg.Way to build my self-esteem.But come on that's why I am a reader.To read about things that seem so unbelievable to achieve,but in the end proving that everything is possible.That's why I love reading. ____________________________________________ \u201cYou're brilliant,\"he says.\"But you're a fool to stay with someone like me.\" I close my eyes at the touch of his hand.\"Then we are both fools.\u201d ____________________________________________ So where to start?...I read this one in 2 days.It's a full action pack filled with thrilling breathtaking scenes,smart decisions,emotions and caring messages.I also enjoyed the romance here.It was different. ____________________________________________ \u201cForever and ever, kid, until you're sick and tired of seeing me.\u201d ____________________________________________ So what I really liked about this book is that the words match characters' age.You don't get to read here about young people quoting like they are 60 years old academics with full degrees,but you have a proper smart fifteen year old conversation between them.Also the way they expressed their emotions and affections it was so awesome,because I was fifteen once and I did the same way(Of course I was not a first class assassin with 1500 points in his trial) ____________________________________________ \u201cIf you want to rebel, rebel from inside the system.That's much more powerful than rebelling outside the system.\u201d ____________________________________________ The beginning was interesting,like all dystopian books out there,because you get introduced with the world and it's problem and ways they rule things.I must say a lot of dystopians look the same in the beginning to me,because all of them include viruses,or mind controllers,government with people who look nice but they are evil,but I can't complain about that,I enjoyed this book so freaking much. ____________________________________________ \u201cThe memory fades, and I\u2019m left hanging on to the ghosts of his words.\u201d ____________________________________________ The plot if well build.Also the world the author created is awesome and I want to see this book being a movie.It would make a brilliant one,because there are glass breaking,roof jumping,guns and tranquilizer.I mean who doesn't like tranquilizers ,they are like the hipster version of cuffs,because we all know cuffs are way to mainstream.Okay let's not get carried away.As I saw the plot was quite unique and I wouldn't change a thing. ____________________________________________ \u201cJune has never looked more beautiful than she does now, unadorned and honest, vulnerable yet invincible.\u201d ____________________________________________ The story follows a boy named Day who is the most wanted criminal.Because of his family situation,one day he needs to break in the hospital to get medicine.He does that but heading out he get's in trouble.With officers and guns and everything he manages to get out.Almost at the end of his escape he faces a police captain and to get away he throws a knife to him.He doesn't look back and heads for his sake.In the other side a girl named June is notified that her brother,the captain,was found dead in the hospital and Day is the main suspect.Now she,the girl with the strongest skills,with the highest points in the Trial ever promises to avenge Day,even if it is the last thing she does ____________________________________________ \u201cYou try to walk in the light.\u201d ____________________________________________ The characters were awesome described.I like reading about them both.And this was one of the first books I saw an equal between the boy and the girl.They were equal in every way possible.That made the book way more interesting. June June was great.A badass beautiful fifteen year old heroine.She is hell of a smartass also,and she sure knows what she is capable of. Day Day was also a great character.I liked his sense of humor.He was also strong and too smart for a fifteen year old. ____________________________________________ \u201cMy mother used to hope that I would rise up from my humble roots. Become someone sucessful, or even famous. I'm famous all right, but I don't think it's what she had in mind.\u201d ____________________________________________ I recommend this book to every reader out there.Is one of the best books I have read in 2014 and I have read pretty brilliant ones this year.If you want an action pack book with a lot of smart thinking in it , you should pick this up. ...more I like an action-packed adventure, don't you? Legend is a lot of fun to read, and follows two teens who are born into opposite sides of a war in a futuristic Los Angeles in the Republic of America. 15-year-old June is an exceptionally gifted prodigy who is being groomed to become a military star.

But when her brother is senselessly murdered, she embarks upon a mission to find his killer--and discovers that all signs point towards Day, a notorious criminal who is already wanted by the Republic. This is a cocktail of utopian YA, Romeo and Juliet , and various wronged imprisonment stories all blended together with liberal dashes of adventure and intrigue. I liked both June and Day, and I was eager to learn more about the big mystery behind why the government is so interested in Day's brother. The best thing about Legend , however, is the terrific action sequences that the author writes into the story: there are great chases, exciting escape scenes, girl on girl sparring, and lots more. As with so many of these books that are stretched out to accommodate sequels, there really aren't enough answers unearthed in this first installment, so presumably we'll have to wait until book two to find out the details of government's involvement in biological experimentation. What prevents this from being a truly excellent book, however, is that the book overall feels very slight. At 300 pages, it is surprisingly short and there isn't a great deal of complexity in the characters, the world-building, or the plot. It's also extremely predictable. While the story is certainly well-written, most readers will be able to anticipate pretty much every plot development and thought that crosses the characters' minds...and really, what's the fun in that? Still, I liked this book and I think it's among the better dystopian YA books that have been released lately. It's definitely an entertaining read and I'm interested in seeing where the story goes next. I do wish, however, that it contained more depth and more originality and more...everything, really, in order to make it a truly outstanding and truly memorable book.

This book fell short of a solid 5 for me because it had two small things I didn\u2019t like, but otherwise it was golden. What I truly enjoyed: \u2022 Two unique POV\u2019s of the hunter and the hunted \u2013and I love, love, loved that the girl was the one sent to hunt Day, the criminal, as I tend to see this trope usually in the reverse. \u2022 The action scenes \u2013since I had read The Young Elites I already knew Lu had talent in this arena (that end duel!), and while there was no magic powers this time a 4 out of 5 stars.

And it fits the militaristic atmosphere perfectly. \u2022 The world building: I think it speaks volumes when I don\u2019t even notice its happening. Seriously. I don\u2019t remember any long paragraphs, just tons of snippets as the main characters go about their POV. \u2022 Tess \u2013an adorable side character, and if anything happens to her there will be hell to pay. I'm not usually a fan of child side characters and tend to find them a burden, but this one wormed her way into my heart with her interactions with Day. \u2022 Metias \u2013I really, really liked him and when he (view spoiler) [died I was actually depressed. (hide spoiler) ] He was actually my favorite character until that happened. What I didn\u2019t enjoy so much: \u2022 Special snowflake syndrome. Two 15-year-old\u2019s lead the show. Try as I might, this trope contributed to minus one star. I just couldn\u2019t take the two best in the land being this young, at least with Katniss in The Hunger Games and Saba in Blood Red Road they were never the best and the things they were good at made total sense. Sure, I believe June & Day were good to a degree \u2013but for June to be the superstar recruit sent alone to hunt her nation's number one criminal who also happens to be a hot 15-year-old? Yea, no. That was a bit too far-fetched for me to ever get over it. That said, this trope doesn\u2019t prevent me from enjoyment and 4-stars is still a really good rating. \u2022 The not-quite-insta-love. Now let me clarify: these two do not like each other right away and when Day (view spoiler) [kisses June I think it came at the right time. (hide spoiler) ] What I think my problem was the second-half of the book (view spoiler) [ when Day was captured June's feelings for him seemed to jump really fast. I\u2019m sure some of it was because his life was in danger, but I just\u2026 no. (hide spoiler) ] They didn\u2019t know each other long enough for those intense feelings. I feel like they stayed together for a week and then she\u2019s ready to do anything to save him. Also, because the romance didn't have much tension leading up I couldn\u2019t root for them as a couple as much as I wished I could. I'm a big believer in tension -like for me that is what makes a romance so great in the YA books I read- and when there isn't a lot I just don't become as invested in the love story. Still, I plan on reading this whole series because this was a great debut. Mary Lu has talent and I would like to see where it goes. Did I like this more than Young Elites? Plot-wise yes, it was a lot faster (and while YE had better action this one kept me bored less of the time); romance-wise, no, Enzo is my bae.

Let\u2019s suppose I had the madness, the power ( \"You ever tried going mad without power? It's boring! No one listens to you!\" - Russ Cargill), and the inclination to pit several recently published YA dystopian novels against each other in a brutal and bloody fight to the death a la The Hunger Games. (Please, just roll with my craziness). Now let\u2019s suppose one of these tributes novels is Legend . How, in my mind at least, does it fare in the arena? Without a doubt, at Okay, hypothetical scenario time. Let\u2019s suppose I had the madness, the power ( \"You ever tried going mad without power? It's boring! No one listens to you!\" - Russ Cargill), and the inclination to pit several recently published YA dystopian novels against each other in a brutal and bloody fight to the death a la The Hunger Games. (Please, just roll with my craziness). Now let\u2019s suppose one of these tributes novels is Legend . How, in my mind at least, does it fare in the arena? Without a doubt, at the siren Legend comes sprinting off the plate at full speed and confidence. It takes out a couple of rivals at the kneecaps without even raising a sweat (*cough* Eve *cough* Delirium ) It gets into a vicious scuffle with Shatter Me and Divergent, mostly on account of their break-neck pacing and all having generous sponsors who give them shiny covers and plenty of hype. Legend holds it\u2019s own admirably, makes a narrow escape. Gets it\u2019s hands on a few weapons in the form of interesting characters and solid writing, so when Blood Red Road makes a surprise attack from out of nowhere, Legend puts up a decent fight. However, lurking menacingly in the shadows are the Chaos Walking trilogy and Shipbreaker. These books are comparatively seasoned, superior fighters, and use stealth to their advantage. And ultimately, Legend is no match for the facepunch of awesome that is Monsters of Men. Essentially, what I\u2019m suggesting is that Legend is a strong competitor in the dystopian field, with some decent skills up it\u2019s sleeve, but it\u2019s not quite of the calibre of YA\u2019s finest. To start with, the good: Legend is a fast-paced, action-based novel that makes for quick, immersive reading. Events are set in motion rapidly, gathering speed from the opening chapters, and if you\u2019re willing to let go and enjoy it, it\u2019s quite a ride. Lu doesn\u2019t pull punches and she definitely had me shocked with one of her decisions towards the very end of the story. (view spoiler) [Although, arguably I should have seen it coming, with all the references to the likeness between John and Day. (hide spoiler) ] Lu\u2019s worldbuilding is very visual \u2013 I found it easy to imagine the future LA she was describing: the squalor, the poverty, the land reclaimed by sea, the brutal military presence. The main characters themselves, teens Day and June, have good on-page chemistry and their dynamic is interesting, serving to complement, rather than hijack the plot. Likewise, I enjoyed many of the secondary characters (Metias, Tessa, Kaede). So far, so good. And now, the not so much: While I found the world of Legend \u2018visually\u2019 interesting, the worldbuilding is factually thin. There\u2019s not a whole lot explained or fleshed out, in terms of what has happened to bring the world (or the United States, at least) to this state. I didn\u2019t fully grasp the backstory of the Republic, the Colonies, or the Patriots. Likewise, there\u2019s some reference to the conquest of China, but the issue is only given a brief line. In fact, this was probably my largest problem with Legend \u2013 the ideas are good, the concepts interesting \u2013 but I wanted more. This is a slim book that barely scratches the surface of the world Lu is presenting. And unfortunately I felt that this carried across to other elements of the story, most notably in June\u2019s case. I can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s a fairly large risk on an author\u2019s behalf to choose to write from the perspective of the allegedly most intelligent person. June\u2019s logical thinking and attention to detail are certainly referenced in her narrative, but I didn\u2019t buy her apparently prodigious intelligence. I could see what Lu was attempting, but I don\u2019t totally agree that it was successful. It works a little better in Day\u2019s case, translating to good instincts and street-smarts, but similarly, I wasn\u2019t convinced that he was extraordinarily intelligent to the degree Legend purports. The climax of the story requires a fair amount of suspension of belief, if not throwing it out the window altogether. While the events are easy to get caught up in, they are a little too convenient to be credible. Like an action movie sequence, there\u2019s a lot of distracting noise and commotion, not a whole lot of logic. At the end of the day, Legend is an entertaining book. It\u2019s fun to read, particularly if you like fast paced books with a cinematic feel. I\u2019ll be honest, I read most of it in one sitting and paid for it the next day when I had to get out of bed. That said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the most solid of dystopian novels out there. Beneath the glossy surface, there are definite weaknesses to the plot and the worldbuilding that don\u2019t withstand tough scrutiny. I\u2019d give Legend a ranking of 5 out of 10 before I sent it into the arena to do battle. Then I\u2019d sit back and watch the carnage unfold like an Evil Book Dictator. ...more \u201cEach day means a new twenty-four hours. Each day means everything's possible again.

And Legend was all right, pretty good when compared to some of the crap I've read recently, it just wasn't anything particularly spectacular either. That being said, I'm still probably going to read the sequel because I seem to have come down with that annoying disease known as \"caringaboutthecharactersitis\". In my opinion, this book was significantly better than Delirium , Matched , Shatter Me , Dark Inside , Pure and Article 5 . It stood out amongst other members of the overcrowded dystopian genre, but that was mostly because a lot of the others are so atrociously bad, rather than this being overly mind-blowing. It was fun, though, easy to read, quite entertaining, I don't have any regrets about reading it. The main characters are far less annoying than some I've had the displeasure of encountering in this genre. They're not that original or inspiring but they're the kind of carbon copies I don't mind seeing so much. She is self-reliant and can kick ass without the sexy love interest's assistance. He's kind, considerate and brave. The chemistry between them never seems forced, despite it being yet another \"they felt drawn to one another\" scenario. Somehow it doesn't matter that much here. The world building is the weakest part of the novel, something that seems to apply to most new releases in the dystopian genre. A fact which is strange when surely the whole point of a \"dystopia\" is the world the characters interact in. But whatever, I will begin to sound like a broken record. It does get better towards the end of Legend with clues being introduced about the time before the Republic existed. This gives me hope that Marie Lu is simply withholding her world building to prolong the reader's interest, but I just hope that I'm not left hanging on this matter at the end of the second book too. Another thing I didn't like - because I couldn't believe in it - was all the huge leaping to conveniently accurate conclusions. The protagonists would look at an unbelievably small piece of evidence and manage to solve an entire mystery out of it. I wasn't convinced, I don't care how smart you are, you would not have gone from A to B like that. You just wouldn't. Though this isn't going to make it onto any of my \"favourites\" lists, I'd recommend this book to a lot of people. Those who keep loving trashy dystopias with a forbidden romance story, those who liked any of those books I listed in the second paragraph. Those who look for light entertainment rather than deep meaning or fantastic writing in their books. I conclude that Legend is not that bad, it'll probably be a hit with anyone who isn't getting tired of reading poorly constructed dystopia after poorly constructed dystopia.

This book just reminds me of christmas and cooking for christmas, because thats what I was doing when I rarely wasn't reading this book. hahaha! Please, do yourself a favour and go read this book. It is now one of my all time favourites, and I cannot wait to continue the series!!:D ...more I am always afraid to read a book when I\u2019ve been holding my breath for it to come out. Legend is one of those. I had high hopes and I am glad to say that my expectations have been met. I was really eager to meet Day. I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about him and I was pretty much intrigued, for lack of a better word. Even though in the last half of the book he was more or less absent, I got to care more for him and to understand him better (compared to June). He was an interesting character \u2013 he was I am always afraid to read a book when I\u2019ve been holding my breath for it to come out. Legend is one of those. I had high hopes and I am glad to say that my expectations have been met. I was really eager to meet Day. I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about him and I was pretty much intrigued, for lack of a better word. Even though in the last half of the book he was more or less absent, I got to care more for him and to understand him better (compared to June). He was an interesting character \u2013 he was smart; he had some great physical abilities that kept him alive in the past 5 years; he had a great family he cared about and his love for them was heartbreaking, his desperation so strong. He was the victim of so many turnarounds and I felt a need so raw to protect him, I wanted to take his pain away, feeling a deep sympathy and sorrow for him. Also, I liked his friendship with Tess and how he cared about her, how they needed and helped each other. At the opposite side there is June \u2013 as it seemed that she had it all too easily \u2013 she was the Republic\u2019s favorite, her brother\u2019s little angel; she thought she could catch Day and she did it in a too easy way. Also her tragedy belonged mostly to the past. I felt like I didn\u2019t witness any of her tragedies and compassion never came. She lost her parents but I didn\u2019t see a strong connection between them so I didn\u2019t feel her pain. She lost her brother (and I felt sorry about it because I really liked Metias, as little as I got to know him. I knew he was suppose to die but still I hoped for this to change somehow through the story) but it was all so quick, again I didn\u2019t feel her pain. What I liked about her is that she kept true to her beliefs until the moment she had some good reasons to not trust any longer the world she was living in. She had her priorities straight \u2013 she wanted to catch her brother\u2019s killer and she never let her feelings change what she knew she had to do. More than that I appreciated her devotion \u2013 when she has something in her mind there was nothing in this world that could stop her. She always has a plan and, no matter what, she finds a way to achieve it. What I liked about this book is the action and turnarounds. I liked how I thought I had it all figured out one moment and then something went terribly wrong. It made me hold my breath through the story and I couldn\u2019t put the book down until the very last page. Still, I felt there was something missing. The book is quite short so at the end there was this need for me to find more about the world they lived in. The book didn\u2019t deliver much information regarding the world building mostly because the characters were a bit clueless about everything that was happening around/behind them. This might change in the next installment so I am not complaining too much. Also the relation between Day and June felt a bit rushed and underdeveloped. I expected a bit more chemistry. The days spent together were not enough for them to grow some strong feeling for each other (even though June didn\u2019t seem like the usual silly girl falling head over heels in love at first sight and then leaving all behind for those feelings \u2013 June was definitely better than that and I really appreciated it for a change.) Now I can\u2019t wait for the next installment. I want to know more about Day, his past, his brother and his dad, I want to know more about June\u2019s family and the biological weapons. I want to see Day and June together, fighting this world\u2026 What can I say, my expectations are high again!

So when I first heard of Legend earlier this year I knew I had to get a hold of it ASAP. And I wasn't entirely disappointed because Legend features a strong, kick-ass heroine, a disturbing future world, multi-cultural characters, and tons of action. Legend tells the story of a two remarkable 15-year-olds, Day and June, living on West cost of the United States now known as The Republic. This book instantly I'm a dystopian book fanatic. I collect them like the Cookie Monster collects his cookies. So when I first heard of Legend earlier this year I knew I had to get a hold of it ASAP. And I wasn't entirely disappointed because Legend features a strong, kick-ass heroine, a disturbing future world, multi-cultural characters, and tons of action. Legend tells the story of a two remarkable 15-year-olds, Day and June, living on West cost of the United States now known as The Republic. This book instantly reminded me of Aladdin because Day is from a very poor area of The Republic and steals from the rich to help out his family and community. June on the other hand, has grown up in one of the wealthiest areas and has everything she could ask for and a secure future. Their paths suddenly cross after June's brother is murdered during a hospital break-in attempt by Day. The Republic's military uses June's thirst for revenge and has her track Day and bring him to justice. However, June soon finds out her safe world has not been what it appeared to be at all. I loved all the characters in Legend . I felt they were well developed and very likable. Even June's brother, Metais, who dies very early in the story, was likable. Both protagonists were strong and resourceful, though, at times, a little too resourceful. I enjoyed the alternate POVs allowing the reader to get a chance to really understand the backgrounds of both characters. But there were times when I got a little irritated with June for not being able to see the bigger picture of the evils of the Republic. She just seemed entirely too loyal for her to be portrayed as a rule breaker in the beginning. Contrastingly, I really liked Day, who struggles to provide for his family throughout the novel. There were a few scenes that managed to pull at my heartstrings. However, I did have a few issues with the world building. We are led to believe the rest of the US are considered the Rebels and a few natural disasters destroyed most of the East coast. There isn't any real mention of what the outside world is doing either. I know it may seem like I'm nitpicking, but hear me out. If the US were to suffer that bad of a natural disaster, resulting in the crumbling of our government and the extinction of the dollar bill, this would have a huge negative effect on the world's economy. You cannot expect me to believe the rest of the world is chillin' while the US is under a civil war. Where is the United Nations? What side of the war are our ally countries on? For this book to be so focused on military and civil war, I expected to have these answers. Sadly, I did not and for that this book felt a little incomplete. I also had trouble with Day and June being so...unstoppable. Yes, let's use that term. Day breaking into a hospital guarded by armed and trained gun men with just a disguise and two knives? When the soldiers open fire on him only one bullet manages to graze him? Whoever trained these soldiers needs to send them straight back to the boot camp they came from. This is one of those situations where you have to just let all sense of logic float out the window if you are to remotely enjoy the novel. And for June to be so smart I'm not sure how she never guessed the Republic's true intentions from the start. Even when the evidence was sitting there screaming, \"Look at me! Look at me!\" she just...looked the other way. It was very obvious. (view spoiler) [If the Republic is handing out mandatory vaccines to the rich population, but is constantly in the poorer sectors dealing with the dreaded \"plague,\" why didn't anyone question why the Republic didn't hand out the vaccines to the poor also? Or more importantly, why did people think this was okay that they didn't? No one wondered why the Republic wouldn't want to protect all its citizens? Oh, I know! It's because they are the reason behind it all! C'mon, all together now: \"Duh.\" (hide spoiler) ] And of course, my biggest pet peeve was the semi-insta-love between June and Day. I say semi because it wasn't like they met and they were instantly proclaiming their love for one another. It was more of I just didn't believe their romance had enough time to become anything, let alone love. I would have preferred if the romance was left out completely in this book and instead introduced in the second. You know, because usually you become friends before lovers. Despite those issues I was still able to enjoy the book and I'm looking forward to the sequel. My only hope is that the world building is tightened up a bit and possibly a map is thrown in.

Having a familiar taste in her writing, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. And I wasn't! The only problem is, since this is Marie's first actual novel, I noticed changes made in her writing. But that's a good thing, meaning her writing has improved and I was able to see how. So overall, there really wasn't disappointment. Instead, I tried my best to start this novel and finish it in one sitting but sadly, I didn't since I had to go someplace. But besides that, getting back to reading it, I didn't and couldn't stop. Since the first sentence \" My mother thinks I'm dead.\" I was easily attached to this book. Really. That easily. I found it quite surprising since I wasn't a big fan of Marie's novel, The Young Elites, I thought I wouldn't be thrilled by this one, being the first book for the series. Getting on with the review, the book follows two 15 year-olds and again, I read another book with alternating point of views - Day and June. Let me be honest, I've really never liked alternating povs. I didn't mind the shifting ones in Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater and An Ember in the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir. Maybe because all 3 novels are fast-paced and easy to get intrigued by them. I mean, with all 3, I took my time reading them, being not only attached to them but actually being interested in finding out what would happen next. In Shiver I wanted to find out what would happen if Sam really did turn into a wolf again and what would happen to Grace and their relationship. In An Ember in the Ashes I wanted to find out how Laia would save her brother and how Elias would escape. In Legend I wanted to find out how June would find out the truth about her brother's death and discover everything hidden behind other secrets, and how Day would make and save up money for his little brother's illness. Our main character, June, is a prodigy who got a perfect score of her Trial, only ending up getting a better shot for wealth, education and success with whatever path her life is leading her to. Having a brother who is a soldier for the Republic, only being murdered at a hospital, June promises herself and her brother that she will find this murderer, track him down, and kill him. But as she finds out this murderer is Day, LA's most wanted but not most dangerous criminal, she ends up finding the actual truth behind both, her brother's death and her parents. And as both talk to each other like they've known each other longer than 1 week, they discover the truth behind the Republic and the reason for the plague, the illness spreading around children. Set in a dystopian genre, Legend is definitely a recommendation for fans of action-packed books. By action-packed I mean involving brutality, lies only being discovered towards the end, pretending like nothing is known, kidnapping, street fights, bombs suddenly appearing at a stadium filled with people waiting for a young boy to be executed, sacrifices and some romance added to it. Admittedly, I loved both characters since the beginning. June, she's a young woman that all she wanted was to seek revenge for her brother's death. All she wanted was to find out the truth and who was behind everything. Even carrying so much on and with her, she was someone that did not get on my nerves any time, really, not caring about her decisions. Being honest, she didn't make poor decisions. She made them for a reason: to find out the truth, discover secrets, only leading to the path she had been looking for since her vow. Day, our other protagonist, is actually someone who may sound like he has a cold heart or soul, but in reality, he's someone that is trying to find a cure for his little brother. He's someone who cares for his family and friends, trying to keep his identity away from everyone so he won't be caught, even from his own mother who thinks he is dead. He's actually someone who cries for what he feels inside, for what he sees with his beautiful, blue-ocean and bright eyes, and is someone who never ever kills, even if it means his life. Finding out about more characters, this is where the hate for some come. There were 2 in particulate I really hated and got on my nerves: Commander Jamison and Thomas. The Commander was just a hellbitch that gave less of a shit for June and her brother's death, only making it seem real to only feel bad for the girl. Thomas now, was a betraying ass to both, June and his best friend, Metias. The thing is, the characters here are fifteen years old. That's how old I am. Yes, I am young. Yes, I'm still a small teenage child. So maybe that's why I'm enjoying these books set with teenage point of views while I'm still a teen. There were a lot of things happening in Legend at once, being a fast-paced book with battled in it and betrayals. See, there were times where I was left shocked because of what I just read and found out. There were other times where I would cry because of what was happening, only imagining it happening to me. Other times where I was mad because of the shocking thing that had just happened, wanting to close the book and end it. But I was, like I said, easily attached to the book, only wanting to find out what would happen next. I didn't know who was the bad guy at first. I didn't know who was the real killer. I didn't know the reason for it. I didn't know the reason for the violence. I didn't know the reason for the realizations. Now here I am, questioning myself why hadn't I read this earlier? but that's no surprise. I always ask myself there after reading some mind-blowing debut with a different writing. Not only the alternating point of views, or the yellow-colored words for Day's POV, but for the captivating way of the writing. The way Marie is able to write something only to make you keep your eyes on every page, not letting a word slip and be forgotten. Finishing it up, I told myself I would immediately start Prodigy after. The ending in Legend isn't really a cliffhanger, there's no question in what would happen next and no \"jaw-dropping\" where I'm wondering \"what will happen with June and Day? Instead, the ending actually left us with more of a \"stand alone\" book. Or well, it feels like it. I know it's a trilogy, but the ending ended like if no other book would be written. Maybe before the trilogy actually became a thing, maybe that's the reason for it. Maybe it was supposed to be a stand alone. Obviously I don't know since I haven't been in Lu's fanbase for a long quite and I just read her first novel so I can't say much. With all that being said, Marie did not disappoint with this one and I'm excited to see what Prodigy and Champion have for what's next. ...more Pre-review: I read Legend because I'd heard good things about it, but after reading half of this book, I found I'm not happy with the story, not at all.

Do I want to see a female author writing a worthy bestseller? Yes. Do I want to see an Asian getting a head start with her first novel? Yes. Do I want to see *finally* there's a well written dystopian novel gracing the realm of YA? Yes. Still I can't pretend Legend is a good book, I just can't. The following gif shows my feeling toward this book: Okay, I can handle teenagers being stupid and clueless about how the world works, but I can't handle 15 years old teenagers who are supposed to be geniuses to act like a pair of hopeless idiots for an entire book. I am not a huge fan of dystopian novels but I especially dislike authors coming up with dystopian worlds which make no sense at all with governments doing evil things and killing off children for no good reason other than to show off how evil and fucked up said government is. After finished reading the whole story, I read from the Acknowledgement at the back of the book that the author, Marie Lu started writing the story of Legend when she was 14 years old. Ah, now I can understand why as a whole this book feels so very damn juvenile even for a Young Adult novel. I am so done with all this eye-rolling stupidity, I am not going to read any more book by Marie Lu. Should I make a list to note down all the problems we have to face when encountering this piece of works? (1)The main characters: Day: At the ripe old age of 15, this boy has survived alone on the streets for five long years and he is the most wanted criminal in the country. Oh, so in this futuristic America, you become the most wanted criminal not by being a terrorist, a bank robber with firearm, a hacker or a serial killer, but by stealing, pushing pranks at the government and 'making them look bad'. Give me a break. And I don't believe for a second that Day can be a super smart tough kid who had endured the hardship of surviving on the mean streets for five long years, his actions and choices have never showed me enough wit and wisdom for him to survive that long. Plus he never mentions anything about going hungry, having to beg for food and money, being beat up or running into street gang in his past experience, how realistic. June: A 15 years old star student of the military and also the one and only teen in the entire country to get a perfect 1500 score at her Trail when she was 10 years old. Not only June is supposed to be super smart, she also has as much emotion as a robot, who can stay perfectly calm and showing barely any grief when she was informed, out of the blue, her older brother is dead and his corpse is on display right in front of her. Okay, it's nice to have a YA heroine who doesn't cry and moan at the slightest of things, but how can a girl act so emotionless at the wake of her brother's death? And she is also cool when seeing a spy gets tortured half to death? Not to mention, these two super smart teenagers fail to see through the villains' wicked plan when I can see it coming from a mile away. (2)The world building: What world building? I only know the country is at war with another enemy country and every kid has to go through a Trail when they reach 10 years old and those who fail the Trail would be (secretly) sentenced to death; plus the existence of the good-old United States is hidden by the evil government, it's mentioned that there were a series of natural disasters in the past, these are more or less all the world building I've ever gotten. Curious why the evil government would waste all those healthy-but-not-smart-enough kids by NOT training them up to be soldiers or labors when said government is at war with another nation, which means they would have needed all the manpower they can get their hands on instead of killing healthy and able 10 years old. Not to mention, in this futuristic world, police can randomly beat children up for disobedience and they can take money and food from the poor people; but why would the citizens allow it? How does the government justify such things? How does said government remain in power when they are treating the poor people like dirt? Nothing is explained. (3) The messed up little details: Ah yes, in this futuristic world, they can't afford to put CCTVs around hospitals and police stations, but somehow they manage to have the freaking Internet. The point is, when Day breaks into a hospital, there is no CCTV to record his break-in, but by the end of the story, all of a sudden there are CCTVs around for the bad guys to check upon? Why are CCTVs suddenly there? Just because the author said so? Not only that, after the soldiers shot an plague-infected woman, they never bother to pick up the body, they just leave the corpse by the doorstep, and no one cares about an infected corpse being left out in the open neither. Are these people for real? Are they Too Stupid To Live or something? I am shocked that none of them has ever thought about burning the infected woman's body, or even burning the entire house down! (4) Tell, not show and lazy writing: We are told Day and June are smart but their actions and choices have always showed me otherwise, we are told Day is supposed to be a cult hero among the poor citizens but the author never bothers to show me any affection toward Day from any of the citizen I had encountered in the book, no one seems to adore Day aside from Tess and Day's own family. I am told there's a war going on but I see no evidence of how the war may affect the daily life of the general public. I feel like the author is taking us all for fools. To me, Legend is one of the perfect examples of why authors should not be allowed to publish a dystopian novel before they pass some tests on science, sociology, psychology and history.

But the main problem for me which made me see it just as \"2.5 Stars of 5\" is that the whole Book One felt more like a \"TV Show's Pilot Episode\" ,just like one episode with some fillers.. For me I always like the book one makes me want Book 2 not because I didn't get enough,but because I get enough AND I wanted more.. I can't explain well about that but I -for example- like the Part One of Books like Harry Potter \"of course, and it's the best example of Book Ones\" , The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner.. All those books you can just stop after reading book one with a somehow complete story.. But it's not that much the case of here..as well as Divergent which almost end like this one. I'm okay with a cliffhanger ending ,But I prefer book one would at least gives me a more powerful start..something epic to force me waiting for book two. ==========**********========== Finally ******* It is for sure very good Teen book with elements from older Dystopian novels and even Revolution ones..But for me ...as I said,made me feeling too old. May be my rating is harsh a bit \"2.5 Stars\" But I'm hoping it'd be up to 3 when I read Book Two hoping I'd even like more and get better rating to raise this one's. I was almost giving this book 2 stars in Goodreads, But for now I'll just give it 3.. \"They must start giving us the option of the half stars\" and I hope Book two would not let me down..

The world building is OK, the general plot is fine. I think what really drew me in was just how precious the characters are - in particular, Day himself... I've only listened to the audio version of this series so far vs reading the actual books. The narration is great- so I'm not sure how much that is affecting my opinion.

I've only listened to the audio version of this series so far vs reading the actual books. The narration is great- so I'm not sure how much that is affecting my opinion. That being said (and like I mentioned above...) the characters are definitely what made the series for me . Day and June are so sweet and I loved their chemistry. My biggest complaint though is that they definitely act way older than 15. I'm not sure why Marie Lu didn't just make them 17 or 18- which would be much more believable. Sooo I pretty much just changed their ages in my head and I recommend everyone else do the same. I know they age a big during the series but regardless, that age range just doesn't fit. So all in all, don't go into this expecting some super elaborate world or crazy in depth plot - but it is super fun nonetheless. As long as you find yourself connecting to Day and June- you'll definitely enjoy the series just based on them and their interactions - and get plenty of feels out of it.

I went through a phase like six years ago or something where I only read dystopian, but that quickly came to an end with Divergent - a book I did not enjoy. However, I had seen many glowing reviews about Legend , with several stating that Marie Lu has a beautiful writing style. I'm so glad I wasn't let down in the slightest. This particular story tells the story of June and Day , and we get both of their perspectives throughout the book to give a greater insight into our main characters. The story follows death, kindness, lies, and betrayal. Now, doesn't that sound great? Yes . And was it well done? YES . So, like I said before, it's been a while since I read a dystopian book. To be exact it was almost four years ago where I read a quarter of Insurgent before putting it down. However, this was the book to get me straight back into that dystopian mood. For a while, I got confused about how the world was set out, but I quickly got the hang of it after seeing a map that helped me realise what certain things meant Basically, the different sections of America are at war - I could be wrong but that's what I got I just can't even put into words how I feel about this book and how excited I am to read the next one to find out what happens to these characters, as well as the side characters. Characters June \u201cBut the instant the new girl steps into the circle and I see her stance . . . I know I\u2019ve made a big mistake. Kaede strikes like a bull, a battering ram. This girl strikes like a viper.\u201d June is the only one who in the entirety of The Republic who has achieved a perfect score when you take a trial at the age of 10, this leads to having many doors open up for her as well as being a rarity. However, everyone in the book seems to think she's an underachiever. Never quite being on the same page as her. She is constantly fooling them and the whole time I was like At the beginning of the book June's parents are dead and she's only got her brother, who is already a solider for the Republic. However, in the first few chapters (this isn't a spoiler) he is killed and the only suspect is Day , the criminal that the Republic is trying to catch but has no idea what he looks like. Due to this June vows for revenge. \u201cDay\u2019s exploits used to fascinate me. But now he is my matched enemy\u2014my target. My first mission.\u201d I found June to be a touch naive throughout the book, sometimes slow to work things out for herself. However, in some parts she was incredibly intelligent (view spoiler) [as in when she worked out Day was Day when he went to grab the missing necklace around his neck, the necklace she carried. (hide spoiler) ] I think some decisions could have been better made, but for the most part I thought June was a kickass character who could stand up for herself and I'm really hoping this doesnt chaneg. Day \u201cRumor has it that Day once scaled five stories in less than eight seconds. If the Republic\u2019s most-wanted criminal can pull that off, then how are we ever going to catch him if we\u2019re not just as fast? And if we can\u2019t even catch him, how are we going to win the war?\u201d I've read books where the main character is a criminal, but I never had read a book where the main character was 15 and a criminal. A criminal who is most-wanted in the Republic. What a title to have at 15. Day is one of the few people in the Republic who failed his Test. But, he didn't just fail it. No. He got the lowest school in all of the Republic, which is weird. Very weird. When you fail your test you're sent to a labour camp to work, or so that's what everyone is told becasue lets be real this is a dystopian book, the government is obviously shady. Day knows this and could flee if he wanted to, being one of the only people to escape the 'labour camp', except he has family he needs to protect. A family who he does his best for while they think he's dead. I loved Day as a character. I thought he was interesting with his Robin Hood like complex and his willingness to cause trouble for the Republic, but not work for everyone while he did so. He was an interesting character and an interesting character to read from. I mean, how does someone who is so smart get such a low score on the Test? (view spoiler) [He doesn't. \u201cDay didn\u2019t fail his Trial. Not even close. In fact, he got the same score I did: 1500 / 1500. I am no longer the Republic\u2019s only prodigy with a perfect score.\" (hide spoiler) ] Also, my other point on Day was that his name was freaking stupid. I rolled my eyes as soon as I read it - we do get an explanation as to why he chose this particular name, but I still thought it was stupid. \u201cWhy \u2018Day\u2019?\u201d \u201cEach day means a new twenty-four hours. Each day means everything\u2019s possible again. You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time.\u201d He looks toward the railway car\u2019s open door, where streaks of dark water blanket the world. \u201cYou try to walk in the light.\u201d World-Building The world-building wasn't the best, we basically jump straight into the world with no explanation of how or why it has formed this way. We basically just know not to trust the government (like every book). I did find the world interesting as I tried to work things out for myself, but some things had such strange names that I was like what? . However, once you work the world out it is really great. Plot The plot wasn't the most original in a long shot (but nothing really is in this day and age), but I still immensely enjoyed it which was shocking for me since it's been a while since I truly enjoyed a novel. I mean, I do enjoy books but I've been struggling to find that stand out book. Legend was that stand out book for me, praise the lord himself. Writing The writing wasn't the best, it lacked description. It lacked some overall fleshing out. However, I loved it. I found it easy to read and easy to get caught up in. Once I started reading I could barely put my phone down, I had to know where the story was going to lead me. Overall Overall, an absolutely suprising book. A definite new book for my favourites and I'm beyond excited to continue this series.

She writes and she does her own artwork? That's pretty badass. 3.5 stars . So this wasn't the most believable dystopia I've ever read (although, let's get real - most of these books are pretty far from believable anyway). So our male character claims he scaled a four-story building in less than five seconds (without assistance or equipment?). So there were at least a few far-fetched moments. And by far-fetched, I'm just going to put it out there that a 15-year-old isn't going to be in a position of such great power in any sort of modern (non-monarchy) based world. Age that girl by even a couple/few years and I might be more likely to buy that people twice her age are taking orders from her. This time *shrug* I really don't care. I liked the book. It was an engaging read. The entertainment factor was easily 4 stars. We had some action, adventure, and a potential romance based on mutual distrust. Those are all bonus points in my book. There was even a girl-on-girl fight scene and a moment of pistol-whipping. Yes, please. Don't judge me. Sometimes, I like it when people throw down, and watching June pistol-whip Day made me laugh. One aspect which did fascinate me was both Day and June's ability to notice small details, such as what direction a voice would be coming from through a speaker, or how a person could be recognized by the type of knot they tied into their cloak. This is something which did work its way into the bigger picture of their story and I liked how that all unfolded. The instalove question - Is it or isn't it? I'm going with no. Instant attraction, thoughts of wanting to kiss someone, thinking a lot about a person when they're not around...that's all pretty normal for the age, no? At least it was for me at that age (not that I'm claiming to have ever been normal). There was only one scene which sort of hit that silly mark for me in this department, but it wasn't that big of a deal. June and Day were kind of cute, in that brother/sister dangerous boy-meets-dangerous girl kind of way. So the chemistry wasn't off the charts. They have miles to go, I'm guessing. We'll get there. I liked some of the side characters and potential villains. Can't wait to see what's up next for them. Book 2 - let's see what you got! ...more Legend is one of those books that simply demands to be read, not so much because of its original premises, intriguing characters, or fast-paced plot, but rather because everyone seems to have such a varied opinion about it. I always make it a point to read the reviews of my most trusted reviewers - those whose opinions are similar to my own - but when it came to this book, the ratings ranged from amazement, to indifference, to like, to hate. Thus, I knew I had to read this and give it a shot for Legend is one of those books that simply demands to be read, not so much because of its original premises, intriguing characters, or fast-paced plot, but rather because everyone seems to have such a varied opinion about it.

Thus, I knew I had to read this and give it a shot for myself to see what the hype really is all about. Well, if you're anything like me and if you've read your fair share of dystopians, I can tell you now that Legend offers nothing new to this over-wrought genre and, frankly speaking, you aren't missing much if you skip it. If, however, you're nothing like me (or you're just wondering why I couldn't finish one of your favorite books), you might as well stick around. I doubt it'll be a long haul anyway. See, the thing about Legend is that it is exactly like every other post-apocalyptic novel out there. We have our utopian-like society, we have two vastly different characters, we have the slow uncovering of betrayal, that all is not as perfect as it seems. Very, very typical. Now, it isn't that I have an aversion to typical plots - because everyone knows I read more than just a few dystopian series - but the qualities that I needed to make this novel interesting, engaging, and something worth reading were simply lacking. Well, that and I suspect I'm growing tired of this genre...is there really anything new left to explore? One of the first things that stands out about Legend is the unique formatting of the book itself. It is told from the dual narration of June, a prodigy in her society, and Day, a thief who is accused of murdering June's brother. As such, you can imagine that June sets out to find and kill him. Well, another unique aspect of this formatting is that Day's perspective is told in gold lettering while June's is in regular black. At first, I was a little annoyed by this - the gold is, I warn you, hard on the eyes. As the story progressed though, I found myself relying on the font to help me distinguish who was speaking. Yes, the two perspectives in this are really that interchangeable. Not only are June and Day similar individuals, both being extremely smart, calculating, and tough, but their thoughts mirror each other almost exactly. So, really, Legend is about one character named Jay or Dune whose thoughts are shown in two different colors. =.= In addition to the utter lack of characterization, the world-building in this novel was nothing new and I was unable to form much of a connection with the characters. Day, to some extent, is an easier person to get to know, merely because he has feeling. June, however, is distant from everyone but her older brother, who, once dead, makes her just plain unfeeling. So, really, can you blame me for not wanting to continue this? Unoriginal plot lines, characters that lacked distinct personalities, and an attachment that failed to occur. By the time I passed the half-way point of this story, I was done. I can't even say that Marie Lu is a good writer because, really, her writing was nothing special either. Legend is a tiny bit better than Article 5, but not a whole lot much. In fact, Enclave, another DNF for me, is far better, so maybe check that out instead? Or, you know, just give this a shot, because even if it's not for you, it's a quick read and you won't feel as if you wasted your time. At least, not too much.

At first they have the wrong idea about each other based on where they come from, but eventually overcome those prejudices. They must decide if they can trust each other in a world where no one can really be trusted. We've seen this scenario and how it turns out so many times, so I just wanted to see if this story would bring something new to the table. Sadly, as far as the romance goes, it does not. I honestly felt like I've read their exact \"will they, won't they\"/\"I love you, but I know I shouldn't\" tale countless times with very few details changed in the slightest. I understand that this book is not about the romance, however, so let's get into world building. It was mediocre. I could never imagine myself in this world, and couldn't feel it like you truly can when an author brings their world to life. Some of this may be because she hid all of the horrible things The Republic did until the last 50 pages. I never felt the danger or anything, and by the time I could have I just wasn't feeling very connected to either main character. The characters I liked, but they seemed to blend together. The story is told from the POV of both Day and June, and it flows well, but the characters thoughts and feelings are so similar it was hard for me to know June was a spoiled privileged girl at all. In a way that's good, because I wouldn't have wanted to read about another cliche stuck up rich girl, but I think there could have been a better middle ground. Now that I've discussed everything I didn't like you probably are assuming that I hated this book, but that is definitely wrong. I enjoyed this book quite a lot actually, and the story was interesting. It had a nice quick pace and I didn't want to stop reading it. It's just that there are so many other dystopias out there, and I don't always compare them to one another. I actually rarely do that, but I'm looking for one that will really wow me, and this was nothing special. It was an entertaining read, but I felt no emotions at all, and felt nothing for the characters. It wasn't overly predictable, but there was nothing really shocking happening or any good plot twists. It was simply an okay book. This book could have been the end of the series and I would have been content with how it ended, but since it has more books coming I can say I honestly don't know if I will continue this series or not. I probably will, though, because it seems like this author and the series has potential if she steps up her world building and character development skills. Recommended to those who love action packed dystopias, but aren't too picky about plot or characters. 3.5/5 stars ...more Each day means a new twenty-four hours.

I especially liked the scenes when the two of them interacted, because they really had good chemistry together (which I didn't see in a YA book for quite some time). When it comes to the plot, it was pretty exciting and it did went to some places I did not expect that it would go, but it was nothing mind-blowing.

This map i found in second book, so it answers which countries are colonies. ____________________________________________ Characters : ____________________________________________ The main characters of this story are Day , a criminal, and June , a perfect soldier. They are practically the same type of characters: brave, reckless, na\u00efve(not much), smart (a lot), and best in what they do. They are different only in social status, and in family status: Day has his family (mother and two brothers), but is unable to reveal to them that he is alive, while June has only brother, and their parents died when she was very very little. Day, as drawn by me, check it out ^_^ Oh, and i pity Day for being poor and the most unfortunate character - because in the book he gets: shot in the arm and leg, gets hit by knife and gun, generally gets beaten, he already has one bad knee, one of his eyes is slightly paler than the other, well just do not let me start on the other things that happened to him later... So the conclusion is: Marie Lu is quite a sadist toward her characters, and poor Day officially gets status of tortured hero. The \u201cromance\u201d between Day and June is almost to none existent, and I wouldn\u2019t even call it love, more something like attractiveness. They just didn\u2019t have any time to develop any proper relationship, not with the situations they were in and sides they were on (and that is the thing i liked!!!) . And they are so fluffy together \u2665 ____________________________________________ Overall : ____________________________________________ So why 4 stars? Well, i found it quite awesome while i read it, and it was never boring for me, which is a big plus. Conclusion: I need second book, now. Because i want to know more about Day and June, especially after that ending. Would i recommend it: The answer is yes , i would. I heard there is going to be a movie \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ____________________________________________ COLLECTOR'S EDITION REVIEW ____________________________________________ Final rating: 4/5 stars I got an offer to review an arc for Collector's Edition of the book and I accepted it right away! Reading this one brought me pleasure cause i really love rereading books i loved. Sometimes i get disappointed (i don't like that book anymore), sometimes i feel exactly the same (which is quite good actually) and sometimes my mind is blown away again. This book falls into \"exactly the same\" feeling category which is not bad at all. It just means that i enjoyed it as much as i did when i first read it. So, the rating stays the same: 4/5. And now, i won't review the characters or the story (cause i have done it before) i will just write here how i feel about the info and additional stuff this collector's edition offers: \u2666 first of all, the new cover for the book is beautiful and i really mean it! :D \u2666 it includes the original artwork our talented Marie Lu made, and it's wonderful! I just can't stop looking at it cause it's cute :D \u2666 there are also outtakes which were interesting and enjoyable (some of them not really necessary for the story) \u2666 next we have profiles for Day and June, which were full of info like their personalities, weaknesses, family roots and other things). \u2666 and we have Marie Lu's earlier story of Day, which was a lot more darker and far crueler than Legend (which btw, i really loved since i love dark fantasy/dystopias) \u2666 what i noticed though while reading was that there were some separated words like for example: Skiz fi ght but i believe it's only temporarily and that they will correct it (this was after all ARC version of the book. And also some of the paragraphs weren't all justified . \u2666 Anyway, i just wish there was an info or something which explains the division between Colonies and the Republic (like a map from the second book) because it would clear the confusion while reading the book. ____________________________________________ Overall : ____________________________________________ It was nice and interesting to read all of the new material, and it's a nice addition to the family of books i own. If you really loved Legend, i believe this would satisfy you! *Arc of Collector's edition received for an honest review from Gauntlet Press, thank you* ____________________________________________ \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf ____________________________________________ MY LEGEND REVIEWS: \u25c9 Legend (Legend, #1) \u25c9 Prodigy (Legend, #2) \u25c9 Champion (Legend, #3) This review can be found on my blog: infinity-of-time.blogspot.com also known as... ...more Well I got out of the groove when it comes to dystopia but this was really good and emotional.

I definitely feel that characters will develop a lot in the next two books and that it's going to get even more emotional. What I liked is that they all seemed real, flawed (even though they're smart) and raw. The connection between the characters is amazing and I loved seeing how June accepts these new presumptions about the Republic and how she finally accepts the truth, even though it's not what she wanted to see or hear. Day is a very interesting character as well and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in the future. The writing is quite good and I think that it was a good idea that I chose an audiobook because I connected with both Day and June immediately and loved hearing their thoughts. Now, I didn't particularly like the \"bad guys\" because they didn't really have any development in this book whatsoever and we didn't get to see why are they acting the way they're acting and what is their goal, so they didn't really feel as real as the main protagonists to me. But I hope that the next books will develop in this area too because they definitely have the potential. I heard many great things about this trilogy but I've been putting it off since I'm not always in the mood for dystopian novels, but thank you Sam for reminding me that maybe I should give this trilogy a shot. ...more My review can also be found on my blog Collections . Out of all the YA dystopian novels I've read so far this year, Legend is my favorite. The writing,\u00a0the plot, the setting, and the characters were all great! It had a nice balance of action and development and even a bit romance. I was never underwhelmed by the story. The action had me on the edge of my seat.

Out of all the YA dystopian novels I've read so far this year, Legend is my favorite. The writing,\u00a0the plot, the setting, and the characters were all great! It had a nice balance of action and development and even a bit romance. I was never underwhelmed by the story. The action had me on the edge of my seat. Some parts were pretty intense, and there were shocking revelations and heartbreaking moments throughout the book. I was left feeling anxious at times because I didn't know what to expect next. I just loved everything about it and wish it didn't have to end. I adored the main characters Day and June. I found them both to be extremely likable. Day has lived a rough life growing up in the slums of the Republic, and he risks his life every day to make sure his family has enough food and the other necessities needed to survive. It would be easy to become a cruel and uncaring criminal, but Day never loses his kindness and compassion. It's what I really admire about him. June has grown up in a rich district to an elite family. While she is loyal to the military and the government, her older brother Metias is the one she would do anything for. Because of their different upbringings, June doesn't have the same experiences and views of the world as Day. June isn't lacking compassion, but she is naive and ends up placing her trust with people she has always believed in, never excepting the cruelty they are capable of. I can't fault her for the decisions she makes in the beginning because she truly believes the right thing would be done. What I like about her is that once she realizes her mistake she makes sure it doesn't ever happen again. Although they grew up differently, Day and June are similar in many ways. Like June said in the book, they do almost seem like the same person just born into different worlds. I believe that's why they are attracted to each other when they first meet. They share some of the same traits and qualities. They know what it's like to suffer the lost of loved ones, and neither has ever known anyone who can match their intelligence or survival and fighting skills. (Day may not have June's military training, but if they were to ever fight seriously in either a mental or physical battle, I have no idea who would win! I imagine it would be epic though.) They acknowledge the fact that they haven't known each other that long, but there's a connection between them that has been there since the moment they met. And after what they go through together in the book, that connection continues to grow deeper and stronger. I loved their moments together, and I thought their relationship was done really well. What I also loved about Legend was that I actually felt something for the secondary characters like Metias, Day's family, and Tess. From the synopsis, Metias's fate is known, but his presence is still there in the book. He was a loving brother to June, and I wish his life didn't have to end that way. Tess is a young girl who Day took under his wings two years ago. She's a great person, and I really hope we get more of her in the next book. Day's caring personality definitely comes from his family. The situation Day's family is put through is horrible and broke my heart, and I hope justice is served out to those people who caused their suffering. By the time I got to the end of Legend , all I wanted was more. I really loved the last few pages. I cannot wait to revisit this world and find out what happens next with Day and June and the rest of the characters. (I believe the sequel will be released over a year from now, which is too far!) Legend is a thrilling and awesome start to this trilogy; it's the first YA dystopian novel I've read this year that I actually loved. Highly recommend it to YA dystopian fans! ...more", "Title": "Legend"},
