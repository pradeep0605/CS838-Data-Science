He was able to defy reality by There are three things necessary for a great biography: 1. A compelling subject 2. An engaging narrative 3. Accuracy Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs has all three. Steve Jobs was a fascinating person whose powerful personality and extraordinary life make for a very compelling read. He revolutionized many different technological and entertainment industries by successfully blending technology and the liberal arts, giving consumers products they didn't even know they wanted. He was able to defy reality by simply refusing to accept it (a phenomenon referred to as his \"reality distortion field\"), enabling him to do the impossible. On a personal level, Jobs was a very sensitive and emotional man, yet he was unable to empathize with the feelings of others, which, along with his \"reality distortion field,\" led to him act in unsavory ways towards people in both his personal and professional life. After reading this book it was easy to understand why Jobs is such a polarizing figure. But whether you love or hate him, it's impossible to deny that he had a major impact on the world, or that he was an interesting person. Isaacson's narrative style is engaging. Rather than listing a bunch of facts and quotes, which would make for a very dull read, he uses them to construct a story about Jobs' life. The book is also structured in a logical fashion. Although largely chronological, the chapters do center around certain themes. Isaacson also avoids getting bogged down by technological details, which can be a temptation in a book that features a computer company. Even when the technological aspects of a product are necessary to illustrate a point, they are explained simply so that even a reader who is not tech savvy can understand. In terms of accuracy, I can only judge based on what I know from other sources as well as my impression after reading the biography. I do not have the resources or connections to go through every assertion made and verify them. I can, however, assess whether or not Isaacson appeared to be presenting an overly positive or negative picture. I believe that Isaacson presents a realistic picture of Jobs that includes both the positive and negative sides to his personality. Jobs comes across as a real person with a lot of flaws and perhaps a mental illness, but who has also accomplished some amazing things. I did not get the feeling that Isaacson was trying to whitewash or defame him. This is not to say that Isaacson is unbiased, but I have yet to find a biographer who isn't. A biographer must be passionate about his or her subject in order to devote the time needed to write a thorough biography, and with passion comes bias, whether positive or negative. Isaacson was positively biased towards Jobs, however, this did not prevent him from exposing the darker side of Jobs' personality. He also contradicts Jobs' own statements with both facts and other people's accounts. I appreciated that he included both sides of a story. However, he does tend to justify Jobs' obnoxious behavior and negative personality traits by reminding the reader that these behaviors and traits also led him to do great things, and achieve the impossible. It often seems as though Isaacson is implying that the ends justify the means, although the reader is able to form his or her own opinion. If you can ignore Isaacson's apologetic tone, which is present throughout, the biography does present a balanced picture of Jobs. Overall, I really enjoyed this biography. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Steve Jobs, Apple, or is interested in particularly influential people. Although Pixar plays a much smaller role, there are also some interesting stories about how Pixar came to be what it is today. I would not recommend this biography to Apple haters or Steve Jobs haters due to Isaacson's apologetic presentation of Jobs' negative traits, nor would I recommend it to fans who would rather remember an idealized version of Jobs. Also, I'd caution readers to remember that this is a biography about Steve Jobs, not about the history of Apple. While Apple is featured in this biography quite a bit since it was a huge part of Jobs' life, more so than his other companies or even his family, there are pieces of Apple's story that are missing or glossed over, presumably because in the grand scheme of Jobs' life, they were not that important. If you are looking for a complete profile of Apple, this is not it, although it will give you some interesting insights into the company, and provide a detailed, though incomplete, history. Disclaimer: I think it's important to note my personal history with Apple. I have been drinking the Apple koolaid for about twenty years, which is most of my life. In high school, I used to get into debates with people over whether Macs or PCs were better, often being the only Mac defender in a group arguing for PCs. Like any Apple fanatic, I've regarded Steve Jobs with a sort of reverence usually reserved for rock stars and actors. I was, therefore, deeply interested in reading about his life. Take what you will from my review given my feelings towards Apple, and the man who made the company what it is today. ...more Update This is a very interesting view of Steve Jobs by the mother of his daughter, Lisa (although he denied he was her father, despite paternity tests) and his childhood sweetheart.

I am sure that what she writes in her book The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs is absolutely true.

But still, her feelings and opinions are her own. ____________ This is a fantastically well-written and exhaustive biography of a brilliant, if flawed, man, with no holds barred. Jobs great achievement was to marry an uncompromisingly zen creativity to electronically-advanced products when all around built boxes. The art of form following function taken to its extreme, where even the innards are as beautiful as the case, has an authenticity that appeals to all (even those who won't pay for an Apple product). They say that when you are dying you regret not what you did but what you didn't do. Jobs scarcely regretted a thing, his ego was so vast he could hardly contemplate that he might actually have been wrong and since a young age, he only ever did what he wanted and could not be swayed or persuaded by anyone else to even do something as small as hold his acerbic tongue. I was once an electronics designer. I made quite a lot of money and essentially retired at 25. Sir Alan Sugar, the originator of The Apprentice and a friend and business acquaintance asked me to come to work for him as his personal assistant. I didn't, I decided to sail around the world instead. More fool me. The book made me wish, and not for the first time and not because I am now quite poor (all booksellers are, except the Amazon crew) that I hadn't left electronics, because my head is again full of ideas and that is where they will have to stay. So I have regrets even now. I took the road less travelled and it turned out to end up in a tropical mangrove swamp where I sit, pleasantly bogged down. Jobs took the highway, the one with a good surface and plenty of signs. He overtook everyone and reached his destination of unqualified success, excellence, money and credibility in a very short time, and the world would be a lot poorer without him. RIP Steve. You were a true artist and visionary. I haven't got a Mac myself. Because, as the advert said, I'm just not cool enough.... Edit May 2014. I went to dinner on a 93' yacht with a chef, hostess and a couple of crew and the captain gave me an iPad for a present. He said it was only a first gen. one and I was too cool not to have a Mac :-) This is true ;-). I did't see the captain for about three or four months. We were in the same marina bar. He asked me how I liked the ipad and I said great and went to get it out of my bag. It was gone. Someone had stolen it from my bag within the last ten minutes (I'd only been there that long). But who... in a crowd how can you tell? I have a really cheap under $100 Chinese tablet now. It does everything that the ipad did but it isn't thin and cool. But then neither am I.

Some might say that his gifts to tech development, or the fact that he changed and invented whole industries, would compensate. Maybe the two things went together, cruelty and brilliance. But the lesson to be drawn here, future CEOs, isn't that his cruelty fed his brilliance! He was aware of the pain he was causing other people, yet like so many other cruel, overbearing, harsh, thoughtless and petulant overlords, he was very thin-skinned. Also, I don't believe that his often-cited sense of abandonment, from having been put up for adoption, justifies his behavior. He was, as the author put it, \"bratty.\" Jobs would fiddle with design changes to the point of driving his team mad. A thousand different variations of white weren't satisfactory. He wanted a new color to be invented, regardless of the damage done to the rollout of the new object. As I said, I'm only halfway through the book. Hopefully there'll be some positive info about SJ that will balance out some of the negativity I've spelled out. I'll finish this review when I finish the book. Nov. 8, 2011: I finished the book. Here are the rest of my thoughts. Isaacson makes an interesting point when he says Jobs was a genius. He means genius not in terms of a high IQ, but in terms of an ability to see things in surges of intuition, inspiration, and creativity. (BTW here's an interesting rundown of the smartest people on the planet: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-sm... ) Because of his genius, I agree that Jobs deserves to be included in the company of Edison, Franklin, et al. Steve Jobs pushed everybody until they wanted to kill him, but the pushing yielded amazing, brilliant new products. His unique brainpower allowed him to see how things might align, merge, and serve each other, and how utility might be blended with art. That vision led to creations of whole industries. His obsession with perfection and control led him to flirt with emulating the Big Brother that Apple was created to bring down. One of the fascinating threads of this book was the debate between proponents of closed and open systems. Was it better to manufacture a pristine, inflexible system or the messier free thinking open system? And what were the implications of that belief on Jobs' view of his customers and his worldview? Yet he defined petulance. His food had to be just so. He would send back a glass of orange juice three times until finally satisfied it was fresh. He was vindictive, cruel and even Machiavellian. He wasn't much of a family man, and he ignored his kids to a painful extent. Isaacson mused that Jobs' meanness wasn't a critical part of his success. He was totally aware of its effect on others, yet he indulged. In spite of my aversion to the man, I actually felt empowered as I came to the end of the book. Steve Jobs had lived by certain precepts, which in the current economy we could all benefit from: ---Know your value ---Have a skill you can sell. Be really, really good at something. ---Things can turn around if you persevere, but don't be afraid to walk away. Unbending to the end, even the prospect of death didn't soften him up much, but he brought me up short on the last page of the book, because I am obsessed with the same question: \"I like to think that something survives after you die. It's strange to think that you accumulate all this experience, and maybe a little wisdom, and it just goes away. So I really want to believe that something survives, and that maybe your consciousness endures.\" I closed the book with a bit more compassion for this difficult man and went outside to pick cilantro for that night's dinner. Since we'd just had a serious storm, I declined to rinse it. I simply cleaned it, thinking, \u201cOrganic and pristine from the garden. Steve would\u2019ve approved.\u201d ...more so, we are having the event for this book at our store tonight. the number of people calling up to ask if steve jobs will also be present to sign is staggering. in other words, \"i care enough about steve jobs to want to read a 600+ page book about him, but i am somehow unaware that he is deceased.\" is what i hope. the alternative is ghoulish and i do not want to entertain it.

Besides, it will probably make you buy and read the whole thing anyway. To call this man a \"Great Marketer\" is probably a great disservice to him and Steve would probably have had a fit about that. I used to think of him as an epitome of modern marketing as well, but he would probably classify marketing as 'evil' in his radar. He hated the idea of any company focusing on marketing and emphatically states that is the whole problem with most companies today. This is probably a difficult idea to get to grips with, but is essential too. I hope every Management Guru and CEO is studying this book and drawing the right lessons. We could truly be in a better world if they do. Just to clarify, I am not a fanboy of all apple products though I am sure the Mac is the best tech device till date but I do I fall on the android side of the fence. But, Jobs' philosophy on running companies and driving innovation is the best in the modern age and should be copied shamelessly, if not their product features (I am looking at you Samsung). ...more My background is as a post-1979 punk rocker.

Anyone who has grown up with siblings can attest to the influence of siblings on their personality. To me the lack of insight into his teen and pre-teen life leaves a glaring hole in understanding the man. My opinion of Steve Jobs: The ends don't justify the means. I don't care how creative or driven you are; you're not allowed to be an asshole to your fellow human beings. ...more Executive summary of Isaacson's \"Steve Jobs\": - Remove everything that is unnecessary. - Be ruthless about building an A team. - Make stuff you believe in. - Collaborate often through vigorous discussion. - Push yourself and others to do the impossible now. - Make great experiences by simplifying. - Own your work and protect it. - Live at intersection of intellect and intuition.

The thing that struck me most about Steve Jobs was that he was an incredible perfectionist. He was a craftsman, and wanted the computers he built to be beautiful and amazing and useful. He believed that computers were \"at the intersection of technology and liberal arts\" - a phrase he used a lot - because he realized computers weren't just for geeks. They are for everyone, and needed to be able to be used by everyone. Steve put design at the top of product pyramid at Apple - above engineering. This means they spent a lot of time trying to fit the hardware into the beautifully designed cases the designers came up with, and the designers and engineers had to work together closely. This can backfire (eg Antennagate), but largely it worked really well. It produced amazing computers that were visually distinct from everything else in the market, and that \"just work\". If I learned anything from this book, it's that Apple believed that design is paramount, and spending extra time and engineering resources to make a beautiful design work is worth it. Apple's design philosophy is to \"make it simple. Really simple\" . You still see this today - go to Apple.com - you will see ONE product. Now try Amazon . According to the book, Jobs learned this from Markkula, who taught him that \"A great company must be able to impute its values from the first impression it makes\". Steve's ethos was basically that if you are going to do something, do it right. The book is full of examples of Steve doing this. When the iMac first came out it looked like no other computer. It was interesting to hear how difficult it was for the engineers to accommodate a handle on the computer - but it ended up being a defining feature of the computer. I also loved the story of how Steve was obsessed with quality glass, and ordered the highest end stuff he could find for his Apple Stores. Steve's management tactics got a lot of scrutiny in the book - and many other reviewers use words like \"jerk\" to describe him. It sounds like Steve could definitely be a jerk to work for. His management style was to push people as hard as he could, and to let people know when they didn't perform. When pushed like that, a person can have one of two reactions: they either resent it, and end up quitting or getting fired (B-players) - or they accept the challenge to do better, and come back the next week with something even better. Win-win for Steve - he filters out the b-players and gets his a-players to produce the best work they can. But, as was pointed out in the book, if Steve was nothing but a jerk, he wouldn't have built a company full of loyal employees - Apple has one of the lowest turnover rates in the valley. Jobs only hired people who \"had a passion for the product\". I also liked how he motivated by looking at the bigger picture; such as the story of how he convinced his engineer that saving 10 seconds off the boot time was worth it because across 5 million users that would save 100 lifetimes per year. The book was full of references to Steve's dynamic personality; his \"reality distortion field\" is a great descriptor. Steve believed he could do anything - and he was so persuasive that he could convince those around him that they could whatever it was too. I think this is one of the most defining qualities of an entrepreneur - believing something can be done against all odds. Not being afraid to tear down walls or think outside the box. I loved the description of Steve that \"whatever he was touting was the best thing he ever produced.\" You see him do this in his keynote speeches too. He is always using words like \"best\", \"amazing\", etc to describe whatever he's launching. A big theme that the author made was that especially early on, Steve viewed Apple as \"counter-culture\" rebels. They were hippies who thought they could change the world. And they did - but not only that - I think they embedded their can-do attitude deep in Silicon Valley, which is probably highly correlated with why it is the center of the technology revolution today. This quote is classic: \"The people who invited the twenty-first century were pot-smoking, sandal-wearing hippies from the West Coast like Steve, because they saw differently. The hierarchical systems of the East Coast, England, Germany, and Japan do not encourage this different thinking. The sixties produced an anarchic mind-set that is great for imagining a world not yet in existence.\" One of Steve's great abilities was to focus . When Jobs came back to Apple from his hiatus the biggest innovation he made was to focus the company onto just the few products that were working or had potential. \"What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they\u2019re dragging you down. They\u2019re turning you into Microsoft. They\u2019re causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great.\" Steve's belief that computers need to be beautiful and easy to use basically prevented him from ever licensing his software, as then he wouldn't be able to control the user experience. Microsoft didn't have that problem, and that's why Windows dominated. I think it's also the reason that Windows is in trouble today. They have spent a decade making their code work across hundreds of different hardware configurations. Their code is now full of backwards compatibility support that just makes it messy, and bloated. Worse, their focus is on maintaining all that instead of innovating and improving it. The platform vs integrated approach is being tested again with the iphone vs android. It will be interesting to see if history replays itself, or if Apple's lead and ability to make a superior product because of their full stack control will prevail. In the end, this was the best quote of the book: Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. ...more I had to be convinced by a GR friend to read this book, similarly to how Isaacson had to be convinced to write it. Back in 2004, Steve Jobs approached Isaacson and asked if he was interested in writing Jobs' biography. Isaacson declined several times, thinking that it was too soon to write one and that it would be better to wait a few decades. It wasn't until 2009 when Jobs' wife bluntly told him that Jobs was seriously ill from cancer and that there was little time to lose.

It wasn't until 2009 when Jobs' wife bluntly told him that Jobs was seriously ill from cancer and that there was little time to lose. Isaacson said he hadn't known Jobs was sick; she said few people knew and that Jobs had been trying to keep it a secret. Isaacson finally agreed to write the biography, and Jobs agreed that he wouldn't have any control over the book, which was rare, considering how controlling and demanding he had been over all the various projects at Apple. I had been reluctant to read this book for several reasons. First, because Jobs was a known jackass and I wasn't that interested in reading the various examples of his jackassery. Second, I am not a techie, and while I like and use Apple products every day, I was hesitant to spend my precious reading time on a tech book. Thirdly, this bio is more than 600 pages long! That seemed excessive. A solution was found in an audiobook (read by Dylan Baker), and I am glad I gave it a chance. I was won over early on in the book, when Isaacson included a quote from Jobs in the introduction: \"'I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics,' he said. 'Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.' It was as if he were suggesting themes for his biography (and in this instance, at least, the theme turned out to be valid). The creativity that can occur when a feel for both the humanities and the sciences combine in one strong personality was the topic that most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating innovative economies in the twenty-first century.\" Now THAT is a theme I can get behind. I love the idea of combining artistry and technology, and it's true that Jobs and Apple excelled at creating innovative and beautiful products. Despite my hesitation, I ended up enjoying the stories of how Jobs got his start in computers, and how he met and started collaborating with Steve Wozniak, and the evolution of products at Apple over the decades. Growing up in the 80s, I frequently used those early Apple computers. My friends and I played games on them, and I wrote my school reports on them. Apple computers were just so cool . I liked learning the details of how Jobs helped design the products, including his emphasis that even the parts that are not seen should be beautiful and well-built. He had learned this at a young age from his father, who was a mechanic and a craftsman, and he taught Steve to make sure that the back of something was crafted just as well as the front, even if no one saw it. Jobs took the spirit of artistry very seriously, and always insisted that the designers at Apple were making art with their products. He even had his design team sign the inside of the computer frames, just as a painter would, even though no one but them knew it was there. Another part of the book that I found interesting was Jobs' history with Microsoft founder Bill Gates, with whom he had a fiercely competitive but (mostly) respectful relationship. The two men had very different ideas about system design, and computer techies will probably enjoy the debate of open vs. closed systems. A lot has been written about what a jerk Jobs could be, including telling people to their face that they sucked, that their designs sucked, and that they should be fired for their suckitude. It is also true that he was a dirty hippie, and in the early days of Apple, colleagues had to beg him to take a shower. (Jobs thought that because he was a vegetarian, he didn't need to bathe.) At certain points, I was infuriated with Jobs, both over his treatment of others and later, over his refusal to deal with his cancer diagnosis. When he first learned he was ill, he defied his doctor's advice and delayed having surgery to remove the tumors, giving them months to spread. While impossible to prove, it is likely he could have greatly extended his life had he not been so stubborn in avoiding modern medicine. In the end, I admit I was fascinated by Steve Jobs. He had a remarkable life and career, and while it is a cliche, his products helped change the world. I would highly recommend this biography. Update April 2016 Last night I watched the \"Steve Jobs\" movie that is based on this book (starring Michael Fassbender), and I have to give a shout-out to screenwriter Aaron Sorkin for creating such a compelling film out of this sprawling biography. I was happy I had read this book before watching the movie, because I understood more of the context of the arguments between Woz and Jobs, and Jobs and his ex-girlfriend, and Jobs and everyone else. I highly recommend the film. ...more I downloaded the e-book on my iPad (quite fitting) Sun. night and stayed up until the very wee hours reading (on a work night, no less).

May I suggest: Steve Jobs: Unrelenting Narcissist, Suspected Sociopath and Giant Fucking Asshole Isaacson writes a great biography: He tells a coherent, cohesive story, he interviews all the players and most important he doesn't feel the need to hoist his subject on a pedestal with his pen. When it comes to carrying a story, our author did all the right things. His subject, however, left much to be desired. It's startling to see how someone can be so immensely successful in one aspect of his life and such a complete, utter failure in virtually every other. To illuminate just a few of the many failings of Steve Jobs, allow me to expound upon my proposed subtitle: Unrelenting Narcissist : It's true that if you're going to launch a business in a cutthroat industry and be willing to fight to the death to succeed, you gotta believe in yourself. Jobs, however, took a little positive self-esteem to a whole new level and chose to recreate truth to position himself in the best light. He steals the concept of the GUI from Xerox and it's collaborative sharing, but Microsoft does, well, anything and it's because they're thieves, and we have no respect for thieves. Good ideas? He took credit for them, even if he would veto them upon first review. The man truly believed he could do no wrong, and I can't help but think he probably, just before taking his last breath, was thinking, \"Well there goes the future of Apple.\" Suspected Sociopath : To be clear, I'm using the term \"sociopath\" like I would if I were Wong's junior psychologist on SVU: that is, to define someone with an anti-social personality disorder. The man - Jobs, not Wong; Wong is amazing - fit the profile to a T: Despite having the ability to charm someone's head off when he needed to, Jobs had an absolute lack of genuine regard for almost everyone around him - his wife, his employees, his poor, cast-aside daughters (his son seemed to escape his scorn, which is a charmingly sexist detail), even his supporters (I can't bring myself to call them friends) who were there for him from the beginning. If a person could not - or could no longer - provide a benefit to Jobs, he would cast them aside...but not before cruelly shitting mounds of aggression and abuse all over their bare heads. See? Sociopath. Giant Fucking Asshole : There are seriously almost too many examples of this to count, but let me curate a sample for your consideration. 1). He screwed one of the founding members of Apple out of founders stock that would now be practically priceless. 2). He thinks he can explain away the abuse he doled out to employees by saying that was \"just who I am.\" Seriously? Do you not think that the people around you want to rip your head off every single day? They do, I assure you. But you know what? They hold it in, because collaborative, encouraging environments are better for everyone (unless you're a narcissist and/or a sociopath, in which case, see above). 3). There's something atrocious about a multi-multi-multi-billionaire who can envision how personal computers/GUIs/the mouse/touchscreens/computer animation/digital music/tablets/etc. can change the world for rich consumers, but who can't see that a fraction of his wealth could have changed the world for people who don't have water . It's undeniable that Jobs was fantastically talented and will go down in the books as one of the great visionaries in history. I'm writing my review on my MacBook, and both my iPhone and my iPad (as well as a slew of iPods, Nanos and Shuffles) are nearby, so I guess the guy was doing something right. Still, I don't believe that being an asshole is the answer, and I don't believe it gets better results; it may not get worse results, but if today's Apple is what he created with vinegar, then I'd love to see what he could have done with honey. ...more I'm still not entirely sure what to think. I keep flipflopping between annoyed/disgusted and inspired. I applaud Isaacson for putting a masterful bio together without succumbing to the Reality Distortion Field and vomiting out a piece of Jobs-worship like some Apple/Steve-related books out there. I also really appreciate all these little anecdotes, some that I have seen before and others that are new and all the more enjoyable, that people that knew and interacted with Steve shared in one way or I'm still not entirely sure what to think.

I also really appreciate all these little anecdotes, some that I have seen before and others that are new and all the more enjoyable, that people that knew and interacted with Steve shared in one way or another. On the other hand, I like my personal heroes to have a smidgen of friendly and positive virtues like courtesy and generosity. This book blows away many times over any idea I had that Steve might have been a nice guy at heart with occasional and sometimes very public extremism. The stories related to his daughters and many other women in his personal life nauseated me. I'm frustrated that what I already knew to be his horrifying but effective work attitude also crossed over to his personal life. I appreciate his work and his efforts and he is singlehandedly responsible for me being what I am today, but I despise myself at the moment for having thought this dickless asshole as an awesome role model when I was younger. I wasn't expecting perfection in this regard since we are all human after all, but it was eye opening to see the whole picture in a single book. But that is what I signed up for when I decided to read a no holds barred official bio of Steve, I suppose. Good and bad and worse, all packaged together in a book that is no less beautiful than the products Apple puts out. Tomorrow, I will probably feel bad about this review and feel more inspired by the positive aspects of this bio to push myself harder to work better and to do what is right, like Steve would have done. Then the next day I will be frustrated that he didn't have surgery sooner and think about the what ifs. Rinse, repeat. edit: Tomorrow is today... and Mona's eulogy for her brother is in the NYT ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opi... ). I think that wonderful eulogy brought more tears to my eyes than this bio or even his death did. Short, simple but beautiful, and more importantly, shows me another side of Steve that is more like the person I thought he was before I read the bio. The side that cared about his family but was hindered by the cancer, spreading and getting worse. Thanks for restoring my faith, Mona. ...more I was a little surprised when Steve Jobs died that I actually had an emotional reaction of loss. He was always such a warrior for technological evolution, conceiving products that we didn't know we needed until we held them in our hands. I didn't know I needed an iPod, now I can't travel anywhere without slipping 13,000 songs into my pocket. I now have a playlist for any situation, a wedding, a long drive, robbing a bank, meditation etc. What was so unique about Jobs was that he was a creative p I was a little surprised when Steve Jobs died that I actually had an emotional reaction of loss.

I didn't know I needed an iPod, now I can't travel anywhere without slipping 13,000 songs into my pocket. I now have a playlist for any situation, a wedding, a long drive, robbing a bank, meditation etc. What was so unique about Jobs was that he was a creative person who also had the power to bring a progressive product to life. Good ideas did not die in committee at Apple or Pixar. For some reason conservative leaning people elevate to the highest positions in business in this country. Apple also went through a period of time when Jobs was too radical for a board of directors who wanted to make Apple more like other companies. After reading this biography, I know now that Jobs deserved to be ousted, and what a great occurrence for the world because Pixar would have never been created. He benefited from his time away, learning lessons of consolidating power. When Apple floundered and Jobs was brought back he was much better equipped to lead a company I have always been mystified by the divisions in the country between Apple and Microsoft. I have owned a lot more Apple products than I have PC based products. So without even realizing I guess at some point I joined team Jobs. I used Apples and PCs without really thinking I was being disloyal to a brand, but I have been on the periphery of many heated arguments discussing the merits of PC versus the merits of Macs. I always felt that Jobs was the guy with the concepts and ideas and Gates was sitting around twiddling his thumbs waiting for Jobs to come up with the next \"great thing\" so he could clone it. There is more truth in that statement than fervent PC believers would like to admit. One of Jobs ex-girlfriends happened to read in a psychiatric manual about Narcissistic personality Disorder and decided that Jobs perfectly met the criteria. \"It fit so well and explained so much of what we had struggled with, that I realized expecting him to be nicer or less self-centered was like expecting a blind man to see.\" Jobs was brutal to his employees, to his family, and to his business partners. One of his favorite lines when looking at a new concept was to say \"this is shit\". He was a ranter, skilled with skewering insults, contemptuously rude, and yet so sensitive to any slight. When faced with a fond memory or a beautiful concept that he loved he would burst into tears. To say the least, being in the Steve Jobs orbit would have been not only stressful, but confusing. The people that did the best with him were the people that pushed through the \"distortion field\" that Jobs was nestled in his whole life. For all his failings as a human being and as a boss he was also a talented communicator inspiring people way beyond what they thought they were capable of accomplishing. He firmly believed that nothing was worth doing unless it was going to change the world and that belief was infectious to those that worked with him. When Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer I can remember thinking to myself that no one had ever beaten that form of cancer, but I also thought to myself if anyone can it would be Steve Jobs. His money bought him time. They were able to map the gene of the cancer that was trying to kill him and better target chemo and drugs that would most effectively control the growth of the cancer. \"One of his doctors told him that there was hope that his cancer, and others like it, would soon be considered a manageable chronic disease, which could be kept at bay until the patient died of something else.\" As Jobs said, \"I'm either going to be one of the first to be able to outrun a cancer like this, or I'm going to be one of the last to die from it.\" As we know he lost his battle with cancer, but certainly the money he threw at the disease will end up benefiting all of us. Walter Isaacson is an excellent biographer, I enjoyed his Benjamin Franklin bio very much and intend to read the Einstein biography as well. Steve approached Isaacson to write his biography and Isaacson asked him if he wanted him to write it because he associated himself with Einstein and Franklin. Jobs didn't deny it. He was well aware of his place in history. I liked Steve Jobs more before reading this biography. I have a deeper understanding of how and why he was so successful. I can not emulate his management style nor would I ever want to. He was a destructive personality that inspired creativity. I feel we are diminished by his absence from the ranks and I can only hope there is a young person in a messy garage, tinkering with the concept that will be the next \"thing\" that will change our lives. ...more \u0633\u062a\u064a\u0641 \u062c\u0648\u0628\u0632 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u062a \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645 (Steve Jobs)

Jobs is presented as so much of a whining, pathetic bully that I find myself glad that he died of pancreatic cancer, and I also find myself regretting that he did not die sooner. [paragraph listing instances of Jobs's assholish behavior] In Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian , the sentence \"Glanton spat.\" appears almost like a refrain in a song. Glanton does a lot of spitting. In Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs , the clause \"Jobs cried\" appears with the same frequency. Jobs does a lot of crying. Jobs would cry any time he didn't get his way. His tendency to cry makes me wish I--as technically inept as Jobs himself--could bully someone cleverer than I into building a time machine, so I could use it to go back in time and beat the crap out of Steve Jobs. He fucked over Woz. He continually told people that they were shit. He was duped by John Sculley. He held people in contempt when they didn't behave like assholes. He demanded that a machine in a factory be painted. It fucked up the machine. On The Subject of Jobs's 30th Birthday Party -------------------------------------------- \"Many people had picked out special gifts for a person who was not easy to shop for. Debi Coleman, for example, found a first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Last Tycoon'. But Jobs, in an act that was odd yet not out of character, left all of the gifts in a hotel room.\" page 189 For contrast, on my 30th birthday I bought myself a dog toy in the shape of a plush shotgun shell. It squeaked when you squeezed it. My sister's then-boyfriend did some repairs on my car, which was really nice of him. My point is that Steve Jobs is an inconsiderate asshole. It's kind of fun to read this book if you think of it as a drinking game where you drink every time Steve Jobs is an asshole. You'd be dead of alcohol poisoning by page 10 if you actually drank every time Isaacson reported an instance of Steve Jobs being an asshole. But it's kind of fun to be surprised on every page by a new way in which Jobs is an asshole. Jobs is an inexhaustible genius of finding ways to be an asshole. Look at this shit, from page 188: [...] Andy Cunningham, from Regis McKenna's firm, was in charge of hand-holding and logistics at the Carlyle. When Jobs arrived, he told her that his suite needed to be completely redone, even though it was 10 p.m. and the meetings were to begin the next day. The piano was not in the right place; the strawberries were the wrong type. But his biggest objection was that he didn't like the flowers. He wanted calla lilies. \"We got into a big fight on what a calla lily is,\" Cunningham recalled. \"I know what they are, because I had them at my wedding, but he insisted on having a different type of lily and said I was 'stupid' because I didn't know what a real calla lily was.\" So Cunningham went out and, this being New York, was able to find a place open at midnight where she could get the lilies he wanted. By the time they got the room rearranged, Jobs started objecting to what she was wearing. \"That suit's disgusting,\" he told her. Cunningham knew that at times he just simmered with undirected anger, so she tried to calm him down. \"Look, I know you're angry, and I know how you feel,\" she said.\" \"You have no fucking idea how I feel,\" he shot back, \"no fucking idea what it's like to be me.\" I'll tell you what it feels like to be Steve Jobs: it feels like you're a fucking asshole. [All of page 462 should be included here, to show what an asshole Jobs is, even after he has had cancer.] This book could also have been called The Crying Asshole . See for yourself: Page 197: \"Then he began to cry.\" Steve Jobs, a cause of crying in others as well as himself: \"After Jobs stalked out, Sculley turned away from the glass wall of his office, where others had been looking in on the meeting, and wept.\" (page 199) Page 202: \"He went back to his office, gathered his longtime loyalists on the Macintosh staff, and started to cry.\" Page 206: 'It finally sank in. Jobs realized there was no appeal, no way to warp the reality. He broke down in tears and started making phone calls--to Bill Campbell, Jay Elliot, Mike Murray, and others. Murray's wife, Joyce., was on an overseas call when Jobs phoned, and the operator broke in saying it was an emergency. It better be important, she told the operator. \"It is,\" she heard Jobs say. When her husband got on the phone, Jobs was crying. \"It's over,\" he said. Then he hung up.' See? Crying and callously breaking into someone else's expensive overseas phone call because you couldn't hack it. Page 208: Years later Jobs's eyes welled with tears as he recounted the story [...] Page 442: They all hugged, and Jobs wept. ------------------------------------------- Part II of this Review Isaacson's biography is soft and untechnical, and that's a real shame because it's the anointed-by-Steve-Jobs-himself biography that, at least for the moment, is the Steve Jobs biography of record. Isaacson is not up to the task of explaining what Jobs did when he was at NeXT. That's a shame, because Jobs's work at NeXT forms the basis for everything that Apple is today. There are a couple of reasons an author might want to avoid trying to explain what Jobs did at NeXT. The main reason is that it's fucking complicated. The other reason is that it's boring for most people to read about. (Take it from me, a paid technical writer.) I suspect that Isaacson does not have the technical understanding necessary to explain why the NeXT years were important. It would have taken months and possibly as much as a couple of years for Isaacson to develop the understanding he would need to explain how NeXT was different, and what it made possible that wasn't possible before. Clearly Isaacson didn't find that appealing. Also, probably most of the reading public doesn't want to read a highly technical explanation of the innovations that went into the NeXT operating system. But that means that this book fails to describe the major achievement of Jobs's life. This is probably going to be the biography of record for Steve Jobs. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine how shitty this is. For comparison, Isaacson spends five pages (411-415) describing the contents of Jobs's playlist. Isaacson even talks about how he and Jobs sat around listening to the music on Jobs's iPad2, and reports things that Jobs says about the songs he's listening to. Except for when Jobs is yelling at people for stupid bullshit, he never seems more common in this biography than when he is saying dumb wistful stuff about Boomer music on his iPad2. Here's Jobs, bloviating about The Beatles while listening to the recording sessions for \"Strawberry Fields Forever\": It's a complex song, and it's fascinating to watch the creative process as they went back and forth and finally created it over a few months. Lennon was always my favorite Beatle. [He laughs as Lennon stops during the first take and makes the band go back and revise a chord.] Did you hear that little detour they took? It didn't work, so they went back and started from where they were. It's so raw in this version. It actually makes them sound like mere mortals. You could actually imagine other people doing this, up to this version. Maybe not writing and conceiving it, but certainly playing it. Yet they just didn't stop. They were such perfectionists they keep it going and going. This made a big impression on me when I was in my thirties. You could just tell how much they worked at this. They did a bundle of work between each of these recordings. They kept sending it back to make it closer to perfect. [As he listens to the third take, he points out how the instrumentation has gotten more complex.] The way we build stuff at Apple is often this way. Even the number of models we'd make of a new notebook or iPod. We would start off with a version and then begin refining and refining, doing detailed models of the design, or the buttons, or how a function operates. It's a lot of work, but in the end it just gets better, and soon it's like, \"Wow, how did they do that?!? Where are the screws?\" pp.418-419 So there's Steve Jobs, convincing himself that he invented iterative design because he heard the Beatles do something like it. It's kind of like how Eddie Van Halen says that he realized he could tap when he was at a Led Zeppelin concert and he saw Jimmy Page play the open G string and then hammer on the A on the second fret over and over again. Except in this case, it has nothing to do with guitar playing and everything to do with Steve Jobs convincing himself that he invented iterative design and then cramming his own cock into his throat. The only real consolation to be had in this story is that pancreatic cancer is eating him. ----------------------- Part III of this Review Isaacson has an easier time of explaining the end of Jobs's life, because he stays away from technical material and focuses on easy-to-understand numbers that tell easy-to-understand stories. Here's an example, from the part of the book describing when Jobs convinced Disney to buy Pixar: The deal the proposed was that Disney would purchase Pixar for $7.4 billion in stock. Jobs would thus become Disney's largest shareholder, with approximately 7% of the company's stock compared to 1.7% owned by Eisner and 1$ by Roy Disney. Disney Animation would be put under Pixar, with Lasseter and Catmull running the combined unit. Pixar would retain its independent identity, its studio and headquarters would remain in Emeryville, and it would even keep its own email addresses. (p.441) This story's pretty straightforward: Jobs is rich, and then he gets richer. That's a lot easier to understand than the technical innovations of NeXT. And it's in the book, unlike the technical part of the NeXT years. When discussing Apple's decision to dump the PowerPC and move to Intel microprocessors, Issacson gets about as technical as he ever gets: Bill Gates was amazed. Designing crazy-colored cases did not impress him, but a secret program to switch the CPU in a computer, completed seamlessly and on time, was a feat he truly admired. \"If you'd said 'Okay, we're going to change our microprocessor chip, and we're not going to lose a beat,' that sounds impossible,\" he told me years later, when I asked him about Jobs's accomplishments. \"They basically did that.\" (p.448) I want to make sure to point out some examples of Isaacson sucking the cock of Steve Jobs, to bolster my claim that this is less a biography and more an advertisement for Steve Jobs. So here's a paragraph lifted verbatim from a part of the book where Isaacson is reporting on Steve Jobs's 2005 Stanford commencement speech: The artful minimalism of the speech gave it simplicity, purity, and charm. Search where you will, from anthologies to YouTube, and you won't find a better commencement address. Others may have been more important, such as George Marshall's at Harvard in 1947 announcing a plan to rebuild Europe, but none has had more grace. (page 457) Slurp, slurp, slurp. ---UPDATE 09 Feb 2014--- Virtuous men, busy in the affairs of life, and occupied continually in the saying of virtuous words and the doing of virtuous deeds, are apt to lose track of one lone expression of virtue, however excellent and meritorious, amid the endless succession of righteous and virtuous actions of which their admirable and praiseworthy lives consist. And so it is with unfeigned gratitude that I greet the comment of Hazem Bayado, who, upon seeing my excellent review of Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs , was moved to express this: How can one hate a review here!! While the reviewer mentioned some important points, in particular the NeXT years, or the absence of them actually, I found his continuous sexual analogies to be juvenile, distracting and generally degrading for the review. Ok so Steve Jobs was an asshole in your mind, but what do you call someone who is happy and satisfied about the fact that cancer is eating another human alive? Asshole is an understatement!!! Hazem Bayado's comment brought again to my attention the nearly-forgotten review of Steve Jobs that I composed last May, and thereby afforded me the opportunity to be pleased and delighted by my assessment of the character of Steve Jobs, and to marvel at how correct I was at so tender and green an age, when my judgment was much younger and less-tried than it is today. I should like to take this opportunity to dedicate myself anew to the proposition I articulated here eight months ago to the amusement and enlightenment of so many, that Steve Jobs is an asshole. Why, just the other day, Mark Ames reported that Steve Jobs was involved in a conspiracy to drive down the wages of developers in Silicon Valley: http://goo.gl/C9FBnp . Truly, this is a genius asshole, a Tupac of assholery, to continue from beyond the grave to give reporters material for new reports of assholery of kinds heretofore undared. What fool, having been presented with this information, would gainsay the proposition that Steve Jobs is an asshole? What depravity could give rise to such foolishness? I am sorry that Hazem Bayado found my \"continuous sexual analogies to be juvenile, distracting, and generally degrading for the review\", but I do wish him well. Is it too much to hope that Hazem Bayado will be able to suck greater command of the English language out of a dick? I do hope it isn't, because all people of parts, with their faculties keen to the happenings of the world, can not fail to mark, and can probably not refrain from remaking upon, just how very much he sucks dick. I hope that he manages to suck greater command of the English language out of one of the endless parade of dicks that marches down his throat, so that he may be less a target of sport for those of us with greater command of the tongue. In closing, I can see nothing to alter my earlier judgment, and it is with a great sense of pride that I sustain that earlier judgment and re-dedicate myself to the proposition that Steve Jobs is an asshole. Thank you, Hazem Bayado, for allowing me to spend time in the company of my former self, admiring his courage and revelling in the wisdom of his superior judgment. ------------------------ 23 Oct 2015 In writing Steve Jobs , Walter Isaacson has created a long, posthumous public-relations-style press release for Steve Jobs. In doing this, he has done one of two things. (1) Isaacson has acquiesced to becoming a part of Jobs's strategy to draw attention away from substantive and historical questions that show Jobs in a negative light and worked to draw attention toward easily-understood narratives that show Jobs in a positive light and that are accessible to the average reader. (2) Isaacson has cluelessly been manipulated by Steve Jobs into becoming a part of the strategy to show Jobs in a positive light, giving attention to popular matters of little substance at the expense of substantive technical questions and historically important business dealings. Neither option increases Isaacson's credibility as a biographer. Episodes 42 and 43 of the podcast \"Hypercritical\" by John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin discuss the technical shallowness of Isaacson's biography of Jobs: http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42 http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/43 Mark Ames has covered \"Techtopus\", a wage-fixing scam orchestrated by Google and Steve Jobs. Whatever Isaacson has written in his biography about Jobs's appreciation of The Beatles or his having dating Joni Mitchell or his white-boy, tourist love of India, whatever he has written is simply public relations, and will remain hopelessly so for as long as he adds no examination of Jobs's role in wage-fixing: https://pando.com/tag/techtopus/ Randall Strouss's Steve Jobs and The Next Big Thing remains the book of record for getting a foundation in the innovations of NeXT. The absence of substantive examination of NeXT in Isaacson's book combined with the attention given to Jobs's musical preferences demonstrates the unseriousness of Isaacson's biography. Here's Strouss's book, which as a kind of bonus has the best single-chapter introduction to the innovations of Xerox in the 1970s at the Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2... ...more Update: I 'did' read this a ways back - my friend gave me her book when done--her husband is still living - a Survivor of pancreatic cancer!

He was the visionary leader in our lifetime that made the biggest difference to the most amount of people.

Having just finished it, I don't have a good answer to either question. In fact both seem foolishly simplistic given this rich, sweeping, detailed, and intimate depiction a truly remarkable man's life experience. What I learned about Steve Jobs is that he was very good at some things, and very bad at others. Among the things he was very good at, his true genius lay in his ability to develop products people love at the intersection of engineering and humanities. Later in life he shifted more of his energies toward building a company that institutionalized this genius, though it will be a while before we learn whether he succeeded. What I learned about life - or about business, anyway - is that both our strengths and our weaknesses shape the things we create. What's remarkable about the life of Steve Jobs is how the psychoses and eccentricities of his personality, when channelled through his defining product genius, created the world's most valuable company. His is not the story of a man overcoming the limitations of his worldview; it's the story of a man who changed the world itself to accomodate it. You are not Steve Jobs, as Allen Kelly pointed out in his insightful blog post a few weeks back. But maybe there's a lesson for all of us in the story of a man who brought some beauty into the world not just because of the gifts that made him a genius, but because of the flaws and idiosyncrasies that made him a person. ...more I knew that I would enjoy this book after reading the first few pages, but it far exceeded my expectations. I love learning the history behind products that I use or am familiar with, and Walter Isaacson's book lays out the history of every product Steve Job's is responsible for. Laurene Powell, Jobs' wife, told Isaacson that she didn't want her husband's life whitewashed, and he certainly didn't.

Laurene Powell, Jobs' wife, told Isaacson that she didn't want her husband's life whitewashed, and he certainly didn't. Along with Steve the brilliant innovator who knew how to bring together an A-list team of loyal employees, we get Steve the rude man who will proclaim a product or food or wedding invitation as \"shit\" and then walk away with a clear conscience; Steve the man who has no qualms about crying in front of others if he doesn't get his way or is overburdened; Steve the selfish man who doesn't bother to remember birthdays or anniversaries; Steve the lousy father who denied fathering his first daughter for the first six years of her life, and who wasn't there much for his three children with Powell. I was surprised when I learned that Jobs was not only cooperating with Isaacson on this book, but sought him out. Steve explained that it was because he wanted his children to truly know their father, and I'm so glad that I got to know him, too. ...more Isaacson's book reads just like a Time Magazine. I hate Time Magazine. He prefers telling to showing in his prose, reminds us of his theses whenever they apply, and conveys emotion via bludgeoning, shallow diction. It's that last point that most bothers me, since it leaked into his disappointing performance as an interviewer as well: for instance, he notes dozens of times that someone wept after some event but does not follow up with questions of \"why? would you have reacted that way now? how do Isaacson's book reads just like a Time Magazine.

The author rarely examined his subject's assertions and ideologies critically. This book, then, is useful not so much as a biography but rather as simply a primary source of quotations and accounts. That's tragic because it's almost certainly the best one we're going to get, yet because of its focus on products over people, it's missing so, so much. Why did Jobs seem to prefer Reed to his daughters? How did Laurene put up with his behavior, and to what extent did she think it necessary to his accomplishments? Did Jobs feel that the ends justify the means with respect to his products, or did he simply fail to notice his often-nasty means? Did he believe that one must behave interpersonally with moral disregard to achieve as he did; if so, why? How would he explain Cook's success via absolutely orthogonal style? How did Laurene feel about his lingering feeling for Redse? What would his board say to the author's implied allegation that they are essentially his puppets? There is so much fascinating depth to Jobs's story that is simply not considered. It's this depth and understanding, I feel, that matters: after all, aren't all of us reading this biography because we wish we could replicate Jobs's achievements, yearn to walk a vicarious mile in his shoes, wonder just how much it cost him? Having finished the book, I'm left wondering whether I have trouble empathizing with Jobs because I simply can't understand his moral and rational framework\u2014or because Isaacson's account is so frustratingly impersonal and shallow. ...more I am a little surprised this book ended up being such a disappointment. Walter Isaacson just doesn't know that much about the tech industry and, despite the opportunity and access, didn't learn enough to make it interesting. The one saving grace was the participation of Steve Jobs, his friends, and family, and this alone rescues the book from a lower rating. Granted, this biography is meant for a mass audience, not someone who is a regular listener of Apple podcasts (yes, like me).

Granted, this biography is meant for a mass audience, not someone who is a regular listener of Apple podcasts (yes, like me). The early chapters are fine, though others have pointed out it's largely cribbed from previous books. I was the least familiar with this era, and especially unaware to the extent Jobs was... sorry, it's only way to put this: a fucking whiny little bitch. Every few pages he's crying to get what he wants. Seriously. It's the second half that was a bigger letdown, at least in regard to the inside story of Apple's business decisions and where products are concerned. Sure, there's plenty here, but it's out of chronological order, difficult to follow, and there are big gaps. Isaacson is better at writing about Jobs the individual than he is about Jobs the businessman, and let's not forget that's why we know or care who Steve Jobs was. If you're looking for much more detail than the order in which Apple signed music companies to the iTunes Store, you may be similarly disappointed. If you don't know much more than the broad outlines of Steve Jobs' career, this may be a perfectly worthwhile read. That said, there's also plenty Isaacson gets wrong; I defer to John Siracusa on specific errors and omissions by Isaacson, and as of this writing he's only halfway there:

There was many many things I learned in here that I had no clue about. There is no way I think you can read this book and not just totally be in awe of Jobs. Yes, he was a total asshole. It's also clear that he never made apologizes for this. He has some very obvious personal issues. Professional issues as well. What I never understood is what drove him. After reading this, I feel very sure that money was never a driving force in his life. Instead it was always his passions. His passions for PIXAR. His passion for APPLE. His passion to always be the best. Read this book. I am not sure that I've ever read a book that showed a man with such passions. No, this book is not always a nice pretty picture of Jobs. In fact, at times you will think he is complete shit. You will hate him for how he treats his employees. You will marvel at how he justifies his backhanded business ethics. You will stare open mouthed at his tantrums....but through it all, you can't help but to marvel at the man. At all he accomplished. At how he never gave up, no matter who told him it couldn't be done. You will marvel at how he pushes others into greatness. You will wish you could have experienced his \"reality distortion field\". I also learned so much about APPLE.....I learned and now understand their \"closed system\" I used to really hate this about APPLE...now I am excited about it....You will understand why they really DID change the world that you and I now know. How many things that Jobs pushed that you don't even realize...but things you would be hard pressed to do without. I wish I had read this book years ago. I wish I had been an APPLE fanatic years ago. I wish I had bothered to learn more about Jobs before his passing. I wish everyone knew just what he did for APPLE. The story about APPLE that I really never knew when he came back to it's helm. Again, no matter what your feelings about the man or the company, this is a book worth reading. If you walk away not learning anything new....well, I would surprised. If you walk away without being a little bit awestruck with the man...well, I would be surprised.

Walter Isaacson is a superb writer, and in spite of the fact that Jobs was one of the most prickly and outspoken people on the planet - he has done a brilliant job in researching this abrasive genius. And it turns out, after all, that that Steve Jobs was a genius. He often talked to his staff insultingly, or treated them like idiots; he often stole their ideas, or gave them impossible deadlines - at one stage he even wanted them all to wear a uniform. But they kept coming back for more. He had such passion and drive, artistry and originality..... Nothing but perfection would do. Plus he was the ultimate iconic figure of cool. He inspired enormous loyalty in his workforce, and in all those who bought a piece of Apple magic. As Daniel Lyons of Newsweek Magazine said \" \"He has an uncanny ability to cook up gadgets that we didn't know we needed, but then suddenly can't live without\". To read about the life, creativity and development of this man was fascinating. I'm still a Linux person. I ain't no Apple groover. But now I'm prepared to doff my hat to this extraordinary man and his mind-boggling achievements. For all his shortcomings he was a giant in our landscape. I also want to read more books by Walter Isaacson. ...more Walter Isaacson often uses the word \"prickly\" in reference to Steve Jobs's personality and management style.

To many he was this brilliant innovator and designer, with a cult-like following. To me though, he's largely been an overpraised Asshole who got more credit than he deserved. This book has changed my opinions somewhat. 1) He's a larger asshole than even I thought. 2) He does deserves more of the credit that I was was willing to give him for several key impacts to technology and culture. I earn my living as a Software Engineer. My love of computers came at an early age. My first computer: An Apple IIgs. I came to learn this was basically a souped up version of the original Apple II with improvements borrowed from the Macintosh after that failed to be a success and Steve Jobs was maneuvered out of power at Apple. While to most people that will never be a device of significance, it changed my life. I still have it. I still love it. It's also the only Apple product I've ever owned, and I wasn't the one who bought it, my parents were. I've always had a hate/love relationship with Apple. I can appreciate the innovations of many Apple products: The Mac, The iPod, iPhone and iPad. But I've never wanted to own one. I find the closed nature of their products and lack of customization frustrating and a deal breaker. Steve Wozniak is my favorite Apple Steve, not Mr. Jobs. Without Steve Jobs, some of these products may never have come to be, and certainly not as early. And they certainly wouldn't have been Apple products. He didn't really design or innovate much though. What he did was push his talented engineers to innovate and accomplish things even they didn't think possible. He largely did this by being an asshole. Constantly. Calling people's ideas shit one week then taking credit for them as his own the next. Oh and that doesn't get into all the issues he had as a father or friend. I could never have worked for Apple or Jobs. I probably wouldn't have been up to his standards anyways. As a huge computer/technology fan though, this is a must read book. Like him or hate him you can't disregard his impact on not only technology but culture. My Windows PC (or Linux PC for that matter) wouldn't be the same without the Mac (although I think far too many people are unaware of the innovations of Xerox PARC engineers). My Android phone wouldn't be nearly as good without the iPhone. My favorite quote from this book came from Bill Gates who said something to the effect that a closed system can work, but only with Jobs at the helm. I think Apple without Steve Jobs isn't nearly as good. I don't think that's because Tim Cook isn't an asshole though. It's because what Steve Jobs had was vision, and good taste for design. Not to mention amazing showmanship. I just don't like his products. But Apple fans are legion, and for good reason. The Open vs. Closed debate rages on. Both sides have their merits. First it was Apple and Microsoft, now Apple and Google. I'm firmly on the open side, but understand why the closed side is so popular/successful. Now it feels like innovation has largely stalled as companies are trying to push several technologies (I'm looking at you Smart Watches) that no one seems to really want or care about, and releasing only minor upgrades in hardware and software every year, rather than doing anything groundbreaking. I just hope Apple can start innovating again soon, because we can use the competition again. Steve Jobs was a complicated person. I'm thankful for his contributions to technology. I'm also thankful I never knew him. ...more Since his death in October, those of us who use Apple products and/or have a strong interest in technology have read various obituaries, tributes in blogs, and reviews of the Isaacson book.

Like other books by Isaacson I have read over the years, this book is beautifully written, very well documented, honest in its criticism and praise of Jobs, and really compelling. The end is of course very sad, no matter how you may have felt about Jobs as a human being. He was both a creative genius and a very difficult person to be around not only in the work environment, but with his own family and friends, and at the end, even his doctors and nurses. As a bonus, Isaacson also provides an excellent, well-documented, and honest description of the culture of Silicon Valley and the history of the rise, the fall, and the rise again of Apple. Having worked in Silicon Valley, I was able to have a front row seat to amazingly rapid and fascinating technological advances. I worked with very intelligent, creative, decent, incredibly hard-working people who lived in simple ranch houses and drove nondescript cars. We were never bored. We worked long hours. Eventually we may have even been rewarded financially. But there was another culture in Silicon Valley. There were the personalities, Jobs among them, who landed on the cover of Wired or Fortune. They would be interviewed by Charlie Rose on PBS. Personalities such as Ellison at Oracle, Jim Clark at Silicon Graphics and Netscape, and Scott McNealy at Sun Microsystems, had very strong, notoriously difficult and demanding personalities and super inflated egos. They accumulated vast wealth. They fought with their neighbors over the height of their backyard fences. They built expensive yachts and travelled in custom designed private airplanes. Yes, some of them, such as Hewlett and Packard, or Andrew Grove at Intel, have made significant investments in philanthropic activities. Of course, Bill Gates seems now to be more respected for his global philanthropic activities than for his contributions to Microsoft Jobs personality in particular was very inconsistent, as though he possessed some sort of split personality. He and his family lived in a basic middle class neighborhood in Palo Alto (north of Apple headquarters in Cupertino). They had no security presence in their lives, unlike many. Yet Jobs regularly drove down 101 (a notoriously dangerous freeway) at 100 mph in his Mercedes AMG (a $100,000 car he replaced annually) with no license plates and, once arriving at work, deliberately parked across two handicapped spaces while declining the \u201cstatus\u201d of his own personal CEO parking space. When pulled over for speeding or for driving without plates, he would make an excuse to the officer, speed off again, miracuously arriving safely at his destination. Jobs read the Autobiography of a Yogi once a year and spent time at Buddhist retreats. However, these pursuits did not give him any sense of tranquillity. He could be brutal, extremely hyper-critical with his employees, his suppliers, distributors and ad agencies. He was a genius in directing the creation of remarkable technologies (Apple II, Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad,)frequently copying the work of researchers as Xerox Parc however. He founded the wildly successful Pixar Animation Studios with its long run producing blockbuster animated films. But, he made terribly wrong decisions about his own health. He dressed simply but had bizarre eating habits, eating nothing but carrot juice for months, going on fasts, and adamantly declining food that would assist in building up his immune system during his lengthy illness. I found his treatment of doctors and nurses to be outrageous, but it was very honestly conveyed to Isaacson by Jobs\u2019 wife, Laurene Powell, certain close friends, and even doctors. Waiting for death to take him, Jobs could not resist complaining about the design of his oxygen mask. What would Freud have thought? What type of behavior is this? The chapters on the design of the iPod, the MAC, and the Apple stores were fascinating and also indicative of the very demanding and obsessive nature of Jobs personality. I do appreciate the simplicity of Apple's products, the Zen-like design of devices such as the Macbook Pro and the white iPhone. However I feel guilty possessing them knowing they were produced in China in horrible sweatshop factories, such as Foxcomm, where workers have even committed suicide after working very long hours for very low wages and feeling completely hopeless of ever rising above these conditions. The corporate history of Apple is also told is a very readable and well-documented detail. His dealings with others, including executives at suppliers and distributors, tech journalists, and powerful CEO\u2019s such as Eisner at Disney, are fascinating and provide insights into the egos behind the CEO culture. Also compelling are the background stories behind the first firing of Jobs after his fall-out with former Pepsi CEO John Scully, his failures (such as the LISA computer and the Next computer) his return and attempt to run the highly successful PIXAR Studios at the same time as he was re-energizing Apple, the controversy surrounding back-dated stock options, the secrecy surrounding his health issues, and his final months. Jobs and his team created many highly successful products. But the failures were also given their fair share of treatment. What I\u2019m left with most is a feeling of sadness for his family, his three daughters, his wife, his son, and his sister, Mona Simpson. As his wife, Laurene Powell, discussed at the end of the book (pages 543 \u2013 544), \u201che\u2019s not extraordinary in every realm\u201d. His family was neglected, especially his daughters, even as he must have realized he was going to have only a few short months left in this world. Laurene admits to Isaacson that Steve \u201cdid not have social graces, such as putting himself in other people\u2019s shoes.\u201d I can\u2019t begin to imagine how emotionally drained Laurene especially must feel as she recovers from the ordeal of caring for her husband during this prolonged illness. After months in denial and avoiding treatment he finally accepted various medical treatments but also insisted upon trying bizarre so-called approaches that may have served to only make his condition worse. I wonder to what degree his angry, frenetic behavior, his anger, his constant need to always be in control of everything may have contributed to the development of the cancer that ultimately killed him. What was missing from the book was a deeper look at the manufacturing processes behind the iPad, iPhone and other Apple products. I don\u2019t fault Isaacson for this. There simply could not have been time for him to thoroughly research the issues. These can be examined in another book on the subject. China has closed these factories, such as the notorious Foxcomm, to outside visitors. Before complaining about the high price of Apple and other tech products, we should all think of the low wage Chinese factory workers who are suffering serious damage to their health and well-being, even risking their lives, putting together the products we covet. Perhaps the new management at Apple will finally address these and other social welfare issues. Overall, Apple\u2019s products have provided great benefit to so many around the globe. Do such products have to orginate with people possessing such difficult, abusive personalities? ...more I'm going to post my blog entry on this in its entirety, even though it covers thoughts not strictly related just to the biography, but the biography inspired it all.

I recently finished reading Steve Jobs, the well-written and extensive biography by Walter Issacson. Apple's products, and accordingly Steve Jobs, have made a big impact in my life. First and foremost, computers add a lot more to my life than they would have without the products Apple makes, but also they've influenced my thinking about technology in important ways significant to my career. Early in my life I was exposed to a few Apple computers and wasn't really impressed. While the interfaces seemed like fun toys, I was never really tempted to actually sit in front of one day in and day out. In about 2004, I was hired as CTO of Farheap Solutions. It was my first CTO role at a mid-sized company and I had a staff of over a hundred. I was delighted that with a few exceptions, the company was standardized on Linux. It wasn't just my group, but nearly everyone throughout the company. One set of exceptions were people who had some application that necessitated Windows such as some of the accounting / finance people. The other major exception were people who had laptops. Back then, it was still rather painful to get Linux running on laptops and the path of least resistance was taken and Windows tended to be selected for laptops unless tech people with laptops wanted to fight the battle themselves. I needed a laptop. Our organization was too flat when I first started, so I quickly hired my long-time friend and colleague, Brian Yoder, as a Director of Engineering. When he heard me lamenting the upcoming pain of putting Linux on a laptop, he suggested that I try a Mac. I knew he was a fan, but I tried to wave it off as not being able to do what I wanted and needing the flexibility Linux would allow. He assured me that my conclusion was based on much older machines and that OSX was based on BSD and if I really didn't like everything that was the Mac, I could always just open terminal windows and function that way until I got something better, but really, I was going to love it and I should trust him. I somewhat reluctantly agreed as long as he promised to sit with me and show me how to use the thing. The training session was really unnecessary. Everything was extremely intuitive, though it was nice to have explicit introduction to new conventions like inspectors without having to grope toward them. I loved the thing from the first day. Everything I had thought a computer should be, and many things that I would have thought they should be if I had been clever enough to think of them, the Mac was. I had all the power of the *nix systems I preferred and a user interface that I came to trust and that made everything... perfect. Later, I partook in the fun of waiting in line to get an iPhone on their initial release. That started the process of the Mac becoming the center of my digital life. I got my music collection all in one place. I tended to travel or commute a lot and liked audio books, but centralized storage and tracking increased how much I read by a factor of at least 10. I discovered podcasts. Instead of a plastic storage bin in my garage holding photos that I rarely looked at, I started getting everything scanned and started organizing digital photos. Apple's devices made it easy and fun to centralize and really enjoy anything that could be reduced to digital data. I had been a strong and vocal supporter of open software. Apple made me realize that what I really wanted was good software that did what I wanted. I rarely got the latter. Microsoft failed miserably. Linux was usually far short as well, but rather than being limited by the software or platform, I was only limited by effort I was willing to put into it. That was far more appealing to my personal tastes, even if the results were sometimes worse. Apple took a closed, \"integrated,\" approach with Big Brother fastidiousness. Instead of rubbing against my grain, I found that I simply loved it. If me of 2000 heard me of today talking about the computers and software in my life, he simply wouldn't believe it. Steve Jobs made every decision for me, but he did it at least as well, and often better, than I would have done, and I was happier than I than I ever imagined I could be with the computers in my life. I gritted my teeth once in a while at the thought that some day Apple might make some choice I just couldn't live with and then I'd be screwed, but that shoe still hasn't fallen. The biography was amazing. It enabled me to explicitly identify a lot that was just felt previously. As a crusty, increasingly \"white beard\" type of technologist, I tended to eschew design. I made things work, and that's what I cared about. Jobs looked at computers as things that could potentially be beautiful. Up until reading the biography, I wouldn't have thought that was too important. Sure, a sleek aluminum case looks nice, but that isn't what draws me to the products. It's how they work. But that's not what the design-orientation and beauty focus is about. It's part of it, but not the important part. Consider an example, not from the book. If you buy a new Mac and turn it on, after some razzle dazzle and video it'll politely ask you if you're migrating from an old Mac. If you admit that you are, it says, \"Bring forth the firewire!\" You attach the two computers and wait a few minutes and then your new Mac has everything moved over. And your same applications are open. And the half-written email sitting on your desktop on the old Mac is on the new one. With the cursor blinking happily in the same place. That's what *should* happen. That's not what you expect from your experience if you don't use Apple products. That sort of perfection is what Steve Jobs demanded and made important. Or take backups. It's always been possible. It's always been too painful to do a competent job. So like almost everyone I just copied a few directories to servers or thumb drives once in a while and hoped for the best. How can anyone who has used Time Machine look anyone in the eye and say they do something else? These aren't isolated examples. Everything works that way. Apple makes mistakes, like with the antenna on the iPhone 4. It isn't that they're infallible. It is that they elevate this sort of thing to the forefront of importance and that makes all the difference. I have a friend and colleague who, unimaginably to me, prefers Windows to Mac. One of his chief complaints is that Macs are \"overpriced.\" He reduces this claim to arguing that similar CPU and memory capacity are more cheaply available in alternatives. That's certainly true, but I've become so steeped in Apple mindset that it is difficult to imagine thinking that way. Apple isn't selling CPU cycles. It is selling as perfect a user experience as is possible. I can't imagine caring about anything else for a machine that you're going to actually sit in front of. I don't run Mac servers for my internet array. The cost of CPU and memory matter there. My audio collection not sorting tracks of the biography as: Jobs 1 Jobs 11 Jobs 2 matters much more for the machine that I'm sitting in front of. It may take more CPU cycles to get that right, in fact. And each of them is more expensive. It's worth it. I don't get not seeing that. The biography also lead me to think about how Jobs took this personal vision and made it happen in a company. Some leaders build great companies during their tenure and those companies continue being great. Some CEOs do great things through the vehicle of a company, but leave a mediocre company behind them. It is too soon to know, but I suspect Jobs was near the latter pole. Some of his attitudes, such as placing a strong premium on design and experience, have no doubt left a mark. Reports from the biography and otherwise all agree that he was fanatical about getting the company full of 'A' players, which is a requirement in being a great company. There are other good things. Still, the biography stresses that pretty much every decision at every step of the way was a war with everyone around him that he overcame through personal force of will, power struggles, gross abuse and anything else needed to get things to where he wanted them to be. While the results are astounding, it seems like it should leave the company without any means to make similar decisions following Jobs's death. No one else has that power. No one has the overwhelming personal ability to compel people. Relying on a \"reality distortion field\" of a great man to transcend what is possible in \"reality\" means that you haven't managed to fully make real the track record of accomplishment. It seems that the reasonable expectation for what comes next is lots of uninspired \"reality\" without anyone to distort it. If that's true, we'll not only see an absence of the sort of unparalleled innovation that took Apple from a startup to the most valuable company in the world during Job's tenure (including overcoming the ground lost during his absence), but also we should expect a degradation of the quality of what's already been built. That's tragic and scary. While it is true that Steve Jobs completely created or turned on their ear about six major markets, we needed him to build a great company. I fear that he didn't. One of the first things I said upon hearing that Jobs had died was, \"That starts the clock ticking. We have five years for Google to put computers in front of us.\" I've never wanted to be wrong quite so fervently. Another thing that I've thought a lot about since reading the biography is the picture it paints of interacting with Jobs. The biography is very compelling and the stories match those I've heard firsthand from insiders over time. To the extent it is true, it is clear to me that Jobs had some truly amazing characteristics and in many other ways was just a terrible person. Unless the biography is a complete work of fiction, it is patently obvious that I couldn't have worked with or for him. He abused the people around him. He was completely polar with everything being either \"shit\" or \"amazingly great.\" He co-opted people's ideas. He lied. He threw tantrums. He alternated between wooing people and crying or abusing them. I would have loved to help build the things he built. It would have been strong motivation to be there. Despite that, I know from experience that I couldn't have been in his orbit. I've spun out of good situations because of far less. It is one thing to regard him as a mixed case where good qualities so outweighed the negative that there were great results. The description doesn't really fit that conclusion, though. The book gives me the impression that some of Jobs's qualities that lead to great success were inextricably tied to things that were really messed up. I find that unsettling, and is something I'm thinking about going forward. The book is incredible, and I'd recommend it for anyone. It has changed how I think about building products and what I think is important. It has made me want to figure out how to get some of his results... without losing my soul. :-) ...more Walter Isaacson is without a doubt everyone's favorite cherubic imp if only for his mastery of plural form of cherub, cherubim.

As bracing as Jobs' life can be when transcribed competently, I couldn't help but think, with an impish glint in my eye, that if Jobs really wanted to make a dent in the universe, he'd pick somebody who didn't require a correction on the physics of Angry Birds in the NYT. Here's a wish list of non cherubim: David Carr, Malcolm Gladwell, Steven Levy, Jon Gruber (unsure if he'd be able to stand up to Jobs and poke and prod the way testy anecdote adoring WI does though), Colson Whitehead, Carles or Joshua Topolsky. Whatever Jobs might've claimed to have wished, he really wanted a mythologizer and no generation can be as endlessly, resolutely, almost ignorantly mythos making as the baby boomers. So it was not without a cherubic smile that Jobs sought out this able sous chef to take what can be said about his life and massage it for the palette of the generation which keeps the Allman brothers relevant and nods approvingly when Jobs claims that John Mayer is one of the greatest guitarists ever.

For the books-a-million browser who asks only that things be explained to him or her on a ok-I-see-where-he's-going-with-that level and cannot distinguish an obvious insight from profundity (Gruber posted that Apple itself was Jobs' greatest creation half a year ago), then feel free to learn trivialities and good clich\u00e9s about the cherubim and imps who changed the world. I'm still willing to give Saint Steve the benefit of the doubt and believe that as someone with impeccable aesthetic judgement, he wanted to see how someone with less taste than Charlie Rose and a bit more technological intuition than Larry King, would perceive him, never mind that Isaacson is always a level below and a step behind, watching the throne and on occasion, throwing stones and the king but never quite figuring out that you have to be a really deep guy to know the simple, right thing to say.
