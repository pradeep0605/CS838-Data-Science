He can't find any evidence that the publisher actually exists though, and violent things start happening to David's friends and colleagues. I was rocking through the first half of the book, loving Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n's writing, and then I just stopped caring a little over halfway through. I'm not entirely sure what happened. I think I got sick of having absolutely no freaking idea what was going on. Yeah, I knew who the publisher was, but I didn't know how that was going to tie into everything else. I read this using this really cool post-it-flag bookmark my husband gave me, because I knew that I would probably have tons of quotes I loved in here. The last one is at page 324 out of 531 pages. There's no big event that I can find there, I think that's just where I ran out of patience. I loved Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n's previous book, The Shadow of the Wind , and I have a feeling that a re-read would bump that one up to five stars. I missed having a Ferm\u00edn. There wasn't really anyone to give any lightness or grace to the story. It was all darkness and despair. The relationship between David and Isabella gave a few lighter moments, but he ended up hurting her feelings more often than not, so those were pretty limited. This is sort of a companion to Shadow , and I had a hard time figuring out how and when they fit together. I was confused about how this Sempere was consistently described as being shy and sort of boring, when that wasn't the guy I knew from Shadow . This young Sempere is the father in Shadow . I have to say, my hat is off to the translator, Lucia Graves. She did one heckuva job translating this. The story might have lost me a little, but the writing is still lyrical, and that has to be as much to her credit as to the author's. Maybe I should have put this aside and tried it again later when I realized that I had started to lose interest. I don't think that would have made a difference though. It's still a dark, Gothic novel that fans of that genre will still probably love. I just preferred The Shadow of the Wind much, much more. ...more The book starts out so well, rich in a character, humor, and a powerful sense of place. It captivated me from the first few pages. I couldn't wait to keep reading. I rewarded myself with it each night. I felt I was reading a truly great book, one I was certain would become a beloved favorite of mine. I was so in love, that I was willing to overlook a nagging flaw -- in a story where language and the craft of writing mean so much, where the writer himself aims a spotlight on authorial laziness (\" The book starts out so well, rich in a character, humor, and a powerful sense of place. It captivated me from the first few pages. I couldn't wait to keep reading. I rewarded myself with it each night. I felt I was reading a truly great book, one I was certain would become a beloved favorite of mine. I was so in love, that I was willing to overlook a nagging flaw -- in a story where language and the craft of writing mean so much, where the writer himself aims a spotlight on authorial laziness (\"Don Basilo was a forbidden-looking man with a bushy moustache who did not suffer fools and who subscribed to the theory that the liberal use of adverbs and adjectives was the mark of a pervert or someone with a vitamin deficiency\"), I was astonished by the repeated reliance on cliche phrase. For example: \"In this neck of the woods, one doesn't have to run very fast.\" \"The editorial board had opted to take the bull by the horns...\" \"technically, it was my father who paid, but don't look a gift horse in the mouth\" \"my father came back and found me alive and kicking...\" It was especially bewildering since the author is capable of such amazing, vivid, and fresh prose. How could he possibly let a cliche like \"he let the cat out of the bag\" get past the rough draft? Since the book is a translation, I will give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume it's the translator's fault and not his (one need only look at The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for an example of that). But the cliches would be a minor annoyance if the rest of the book matched the brilliance of the first half. Unfortunately, the book quickly devolves into relentlessly dull exposition, delivered by one-note characters with absolutely no motivation or reason to deliver the speeches to our hero besides the author's need to relay the information. Worse, the plot, such as it was, totally collapses into an unintelligble, incoherent mess that isn't satisfying or entertaining. Nothing that was \"planted\" in the first half pays off in the second. For me, the book was a crushing disappointment. ...more David Martin is a pulp fiction writer struggling in life. He went to Barcelona in hope of a better future, and the mysterious man with an unbelievable offer seemed to fulfill his wish. The events after he accepted the offer changed his life forever. The first book, The Shadow of the Wind managed to exceed my expectations. I was a bit reluctant with this second one, but clearly Zaf\u00f3n is one hell of a writer.

He went to Barcelona in hope of a better future, and the mysterious man with an unbelievable offer seemed to fulfill his wish. The events after he accepted the offer changed his life forever. The first book, The Shadow of the Wind managed to exceed my expectations. I was a bit reluctant with this second one, but clearly Zaf\u00f3n is one hell of a writer. He once again managed to exceed my expectations. I consider him as one of the best Historical-Fiction writer ever. He knows how to write. He knows how to keep the reader interested and captivated all throughout the novel. The plot was only a bit different than the first one, but still captivating. While reading the novel I once again felt like I was living the life of the main character. It felt like I was living in Barcelona the whole time. Zaf\u00f3n can really make the setting seem so believable. The writing was superb, and I could say that his writing is my favorite alongside Stephen King's. I really like it when the writer can make the character so likable and believable at the same time. Nothing changed from the first book, because both characters were unforgettable. David was just a fun guy to read about. He didn't seem pretentious, and the supporting characters were just as good. Isabella and Christina were both perfect for David, but obviously he only loved one, as the author tried to convey. (view spoiler) [ For me though, David had slight feelings toward Isabella, and she obviously reciprocated. Such a shame that they didn't end up together though. (hide spoiler) ] The pacing was consistent. I was interested all throughout and the author even made the ending a bit fast paced than usual. The chapters near the end were action packed and the author surely gave the novel closure, despite the fact that there's a third book in the series. I hate it when a novel feels incomplete because of the ending, thankfully I didn't have that problem with this one. 5/5 stars and I can consider this one of my favorite books ever. Just as good, or even better than the first one. I can't wait to read the next book and novella real soon. I'm really recommending this book, and the author to any avid readers out there. With perfect writing and super plot and characters, you really can't go wrong with Zaf\u00f3n. Highly recommended with a plead to try out at least one of his novels. ...more \u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03ad\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1

read for me. I really, really enjoyed it, and wish that I could give it 5 stars, but I feel like the loose ends were kind of rubber-banded together, rather than tied up all nice and pretty. But first I want to talk about the writing. GOR-GEOUS. Ruiz Zafon captured me with the first paragraph.

I really, really enjoyed it, and wish that I could give it 5 stars, but I feel like the loose ends were kind of rubber-banded together, rather than tied up all nice and pretty. But first I want to talk about the writing. GOR-GEOUS. Ruiz Zafon captured me with the first paragraph. In fact, while I was reading \"What Dreams May Come\" right before this, I snuck a peek and then almost didn't put it back down to finish \"WDMC\". I mean, look at this: \"A writer never forgets the first time he accepted a few coins or a word of praise in exchange for a story. He will never forget the sweet poison of vanity in his blood and the belief that, if he succeeds in not letting anyone discover his lack of talent, the dream of literature will provide him with a roof over his head, a hot meal at the end of the day, and what he covets most: his name on a miserable piece of paper that will surely outlive him. A writer is condemned to remember that moment, because from then on he is doomed and his soul has a price.\" A price, you say? Hmmm... Must read on! So I did, and found that with every page, I enjoyed the book even more. It was dark and gloomy and despairing and creepy at times, and at others it was laugh out loud funny and light and surprising. David, our narrator, is a young writer, who's had a hard time of life, and is therefore older than his years. He's bitter, and jaded, and sarcastic, but still idealistic in a way. I loved the way that he looked at things, and the life he brought to the pages. Even when he was writing himself to death, he's still interesting and dynamic and I wanted to know him better. So, in comes Andreas Correlli, mysterious and perfectly dressed and wanting to put David's talent to use for his own vague purposes. I recognized Correlli for what he was right away, as maybe I was intended to, so I waited anxiously for the inevitable. There is quite a bit of religious speculation and philosophy (if that's the right word) in this book, which was very interesting to me. The conversations that Correlli and David had regarding religion were maybe a touch over my head, but intriguing to read, because both men had more than reason enough to twist things to their own purposes in their conversations, and I was never quite sure whether what they were saying was really what they were saying. From David and Correlli's first meeting, things start to get more and more mysterious and strange. Very surreal in a realistic way, and quite intense. There were times when I'd have to force myself to put the book down to go to bed. And the chapters were so short that it was far too easy to justify \"just one more\". New twists and turns were introduced and I couldn't wait to figure out how they all fit together. But this is where things went a little bit downhill for me. While things were technically ended, and it wasn't a bad ending, I just wish that we had a bit more explanation as to certain things in the story, and that's why I had to drop a star off. I mean, I guess we could just look at it from a stand-point of \"it is because it is because it is\", but I'm always looking for the \"why\" too. I don't want to ruin this book for anyone who has yet to read it, because it is definitely worth reading, so I will not go into spoilerish stuff here. I will just say that I would have liked a bit more wrap up with certain converging storylines. Overall, I immensely enjoyed this book. The writing has a way of just making me part of the story, and the descriptions made me wish I could be in Barcelona to see it for myself. I look forward to reading \"Shadow of the Wind\" soon. ...more \u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0643..\u0623\u0645 \u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629

Now a writer, David is asked by a mysterious editor to write THE book, something nobody has ever dared to write before, in exchange for an enormous sum of money. When Isabella shows up, the story gets even better. Besides the gothic atmosphere, mystery and religious/supernatural events - which, I have to admit, made my heart skip a beat a few times - I totally loved David-Isabella relationship. Their dialogues are so sparkling and witty and they act so stormy (have I watched too many romantic comedies?) I almost wanted them to hook up. But well, Zafon had other plans and David remains devoted to his one true love, Cristina, which leads to all kind of complicated events, because this is what love does, it complicates our already complicated lives, right? So, from one point onward the book totally got me (things disappear, people die, houses are burnt), I basically spent my weekend in bed with it, but the last 50 pages (chasing/escaping/fleeting away - so not my cup of tea) were such a bore and the ending so Spanish opera-meets-supernatural, I couldn't take it! I somehow wanted the-always-cool-never-scared David to end his life (heroically or not), but being a 1st person narrative that was quite impossible. So OK, let him live, but what have we done to deserve such a cheesy ending? (not spoiling anything about that :D) I might be ranting a lot, but don't get me wrong: Zafon has a real talent for story telling and the book is definitely a page-turner; if you're into mystery and thrillers, this is a good choice.

The story follows David Martin, a writer for a newspaper and penny dreadfuls who gets sucked into a creepy plot with a figure called \"the boss\" who employs him to write a book. We get taken along on this journey as Martin discovers some secrets about the previous tenant of his home as well as the book Lux Aeterna that he picks up from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. I absolutely LOVE how Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n writes about Barcelona. He creates such a vivid atmosphere that really transports you into the text. The plots are a bit self-aware at times, becoming quite unrealistic and borderline cheesy in their clich\u00e9, but I actually sort of enjoy them for that. You have to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the fantastical elements. It's like watching a noir film that has all the classic elements to it, but done in such a satisfying way that you can forgive them for their obviousness. Having already read The Shadow of the Wind before, it was fun to see the Cemetery of Forgotten Books as well as Sempere & Sons show up in this one, an earlier time period.

Otra vez Zaf\u00f3n me conquista con sus historias y como las cuenta, es que su prosa es definitivamente la mejor, incluyendo esta vez un realismo m\u00e1gico mas pronunciado, en momentos me preguntaba si lo que le estaban sucediendo a Martin era solo su imaginaci\u00f3n o lo estaba viviendo de verdad, sea como sea, poco a poco se nota como Martin desciende en la locura porque es la \u00fanica forma que tendr\u00e1 de sobrevivir a su catastr\u00f3fica realidad. Lo mejor de este libro es que nos da el punto de vista de un escritor, y todo lo que es capaz de hacer para que sus historias vivan, por eso lo recomiendo ampliamente, ya sea se si eres fan\u00e1tico del cementerio de los libros olvidados, o eres nuevo en la Barcelona de Zaf\u00f3n.

But unfortunately, like the sequel to The Pillars of the Earth , I think the author was trying too hard to recreate his own success at the expense of writing a good book. Zafon tried to bring back the same setting and some of the same characters and themes, but what seemed mystical and magical in Shadow was simply melodramatic here. Characterization was shallow and simplistic, as were the relationships; the writing was choppy. The story just didn't grab me, and nothing compelled me to push myself through 400 more pages. ...more Overall a well-told story with a clever and original plot.

David Martin is a struggling author living in poverty in the seedy depths of Barcelona. He receives an irresistible offer of 100,000 francs to write a book for a creepy man he begins referring to as \"the boss.\" After accepting the offer Martin starts research on the designated topic, triggering a series of strange happenings. He knows he is being \"played\" and used, but he doesn't know why or by whom. Things just get more and more sinister and bizarre as Martin delves into the history of the man who used to live in the tower house he himself is now occupying. Once again, Zafon uses the setting of Barcelona to great advantage. The weather, strange architecture, cemeteries, secret passageways, winding staircases, and abandoned buildings all add to that dark and spooky feeling. While I enjoyed the book, I was left feeling a little frustrated about certain things. There were several characters that were not developed enough to make sense of their motivations, and there were some important things unresolved when I finished the book. It seemed that the author introduced a lot of elements to the plot that he never fully clarified by the end. I was determined to give this book a rating based on its own merits, not on a comparison with The Shadow of the Wind. So I asked myself how I would have rated it if it was written by an author I had never read before. In that case, it would have been four stars, so that's what I gave it. If I *were* comparing it to TSOTW, I would only give it 3 to 3.5 stars. I thought it lacked the richness and fulfillment of TSOTW. I would in no way discourage anyone from reading this book. However, if you haven't read The Shadow of the Wind, I strongly urge you to let that one be your first taste of this author. ...more The Angel's Game actually takes place in the same area of Barcelona as SOTW.

Set in the period just before the civil war that leads up to SOTW. The main character is David Martin, who at the beginning of book is working at a newspaper & gets his chance to be a writer. Soon with the help of of his friend & mentor, Perdo Vidal, he is able to lift himself out of poverty & start writing for a living. He soon leaves the newspaper & starts writing pulp fiction under a pseudonym for a less than desirable publishing house. But while making good money, he realizes that he is truly not happy & longs to write for himself. Soon he's approached by a mysterious benefactor, Andreas Corelli, who asks David to write a book for him. The subject would be Corelli's choosing. And David would have one year to write it. Once he's done, he will be rich & free to write for himself. But just who is this man giving him this chance? And what will it truly cost him in the end? I'd tell you more, but that might give something away. Much like SOTW, there is an overall mystery winding it's way through the story. But at the same time there is a fabulous love story/triangle and sins of the past come back to haunt the characters. Zaf\u00f3n really shines in his storytelling & his dialogue. The interaction between David & his \"ward/protege\", Isabella, is simply magic. As with SOTW, you really fall into the lives of these characters & live and breathe with them. But eventually the story has to end. And at the end I was in tears, not just because of the story, but simply because I knew my time with these characters was coming to a close. This is a book I would highly recommend, definitely in my top 20 of all time.

Don't get me wrong--I don't mind sorrow in a story, or the vestiges of tragedy, or philosophy, or heavy emotional lifting. But Zafon's writing was too good for the plot, especially one that doesn't resolve, and the story ends up more like a spooky B movie in the way the scenes are written. Look out, it's a foggy night. Hey, that pack of starving dogs in the graveyard are freaky huh. What is that trace of red on the snow? Of course it's blood. What's with all the empty deserted houses laden with dust and moldy curtains? Miss Havisham was Zafon's set decorator, for sure. I very much enjoyed all the references to great books, and I loved looking for connections between Dickens's Great Expectations and the happenings in this novel. In fact, the first 150 pages of this book were completely enjoyable, and then came this descent into a pointless mystery with no resolution. Or is the point that only books save us (metaphorically and literally--the way Mart\u00edn is saved by The Steps of Heaven) and that authors have to use their powers for good and not evil? Zafon's book will save no one, and he should take his own moral hint. Three stars for David and Isabella's conversation and relationship, for my love for the bookseller, for the bits of humor sprinkled throughout, and for being a page turner even though I felt that the last page of the book would have been more honest if there had been a big old \"Ha Ha! Made you look!\" sentence instead of the pathetic epilogue. Spoiler alert:: having a character run away is just as poor an end to a story as having the character wake up and find everything was a dream. ...more 4.5* Foi o segundo livro que li de C.R.Z\u00e1fon e come\u00e7o a reconhecer-lhe o estilo g\u00f3tico e misterioso, com alguns apontamentos de sobrenatural que imprime aos seus romances.

Reading that novel, I was carried away to Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and thoroughly enjoyed Ruiz Zafon's magical prose. My overwhelmingly positive experience of The Shadow of the Wind means that I really looked forward to reading this novel. Set some twenty years before The Shadow of the Wind , it focuses on a young writer of sensationalist crime novels, David Martin, who is commissioned by a stranger to write a book and finds himself drawn into a nightmarish world where nothing is what it seems to be. It starts out well. Ruiz Zafon creates a sinister, threatening atmosphere within the architectural splendour of Barcelona. David Martin is an interesting character, as is the main antagonist, who may or may not be (view spoiler) [Lucifer incarnate (hide spoiler) ] . There are discussions of religion, the importance of books and reading and the nature of love. However, it all falls apart at about the halfway point. There's too much ambiguity and digression and too much melodrama. By the end, I had no idea what was going on and what's worse, I didn't much care. I listened to the audiobook edition (which is very well narrated by Dan Stevens) and it occurred to me that my loss of both focus and interest may not have occurred had I been reading the novel rather than listening to it. But I'm not really convinced that's so. It's not as if the novel has nothing going for it. The prose is great, the translation by Lucia Graves is excellent (at least, I assume it is, because it reads like a book written in English) and the threatening, rather Gothic atmosphere Ruiz Zafon creates jump off the page. Four stars for these aspects of the novel and two for the messy, confusing and overblown plot leaves an average of three. I'll definitely go on to read the third book in the series, The Prisoner of Heaven , if for no other reason than I'm hoping it will explain what this novel was all about.

David Martin is a poor journalist writing pulp fiction on the side, but he dreams of doing something greater. Zafon\u2019s style of writing just drips with gorgeous descriptions, devious characters and tragic heroes. His gothic tales are so rich I am willing to forgive much that I would fault another author for. Like so many others, I didn't love this book as much as I loved The Shadow of the Wind, but again, I still loved it. Zafon has a few themes he always returns to in his work: the relationships between fathers and sons, men falling in love women in a higher social class, references to classic novels (Great Expectations, The Count of Monte Cristo), etc. This novel is no exception and it includes all of those things. **SPOILERS: Where I discuss my thoughts on Andreas Corelli** This year I re-read both Shadow of the Wind and this book and I\u2019ve found that re-reading Zafon\u2019s work is a lot like re-watching The Sixth Sense, once you know the ending you view the whole thing through a different lens. There\u2019s one section where David meets Andreas Corelli and Corelli talks about his strained relationship with his father. He said he was cast out of his home and I couldn\u2019t help thinking this was a clever reference to his father being \u201cGod\u201d and Corelli being the Devil. Also, I forgot quite a bit about the details of David\u2019s brain tumor. The most fascinating thing about this book is its ambiguity. For some it\u2019s clear Corelli is the Devil and Martin makes a Faustian deal for both his health and what his soul desires. For others Martin is clearly a victim of his own delusions, brought on by his brain tumor. It\u2019s possible his hallucinations are caused by schizophrenia or his brain tumor and the entire character of Corelli exists only in his mind. This is possibly enforced by Martin\u2019s mumbling conversations (witnessed by Fermin) with himself while imprisoned in The Prisoner of Heaven. If it is all in David\u2019s mind, then he\u2019s the one who killed his Publisher\u2019s, not Corelli. Or it\u2019s possible Corelli used David as a puppet and committed the murders through him and then made him forget them. This might be supported by the moment when David saves Isabella and then leaves her attackers in the alley. He hears later that they were beaten with a pipe, just like the one he was carrying. So that indicates he might have done it but then blocked it out, Fight Club-style. There are so many possibilities! Another indicator that Corelli really is the Devil, regardless of whether or not others can see him; the first author who lived in the Tower House went through the same thing David did. If it\u2019s all in David\u2019s head then the other author\u2019s story wouldn\u2019t make sense. And we see Christina go crazy and speak to an invisible person, which once again suggests that Corelli is there. So my conclusion in the end is that I think it\u2019s a combination of both things. I think it is madness, but I think it\u2019s caused by Corelli who really is the Devil. He uses the madness as a weapon to get what he wants from people. **SPOILERS OVER** I was forewarned by other fans not to rush through The Angel\u2019s Game, as I was tempted to do. Zafon is an author that should be savored. His novels are so full of his passion for both Barcelona and reading that I found myself wishing I could wander the city's streets after I put the book down. I wish so badly that the Cemetery of Forgotten Books was a real place Now that I have re-read this one I feel like I\u2019ve noticed so many more important details and I understand it much better. I have a feeling my appreciation for it will deepen each time I return to it. BOTTOM LINE: A beautifully twisted and strange novel, The Angel\u2019s Game will leave you reeling and wanting to start it all over again when you finish. The complicated plot isn\u2019t for everyone, but it\u2019s worth it if you loved The Shadow of the Wind. If you read and enjoy that one then I would recommend both The Angel's Game and The Prisoner of Heaven. \u201cWe looked at each other bound by an infinite complicity that needed no words.\u201d ...more The Angel's Game is the second in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series which began with The Shadow Of The Wind.

Each book is an independent entity and yet the stories are interwoven. They can be read in any order. Much darker than the first, this is an entirely different mystery. The question for me was, \"At what price, does the artist sell his soul for the sake of his art?\" And does the giving up of the soul involve a bargain with Lucifer, or losing touch with reality and self in a combination of hallucinations, schizophrenic stupor or frenzy? Or in this case, a brain tumor... The author leaves this up to the reader to decide and the possible interpretations are many. One of the strongest aspects of Carlos Ruiz Zafon's work is his descriptive writing of Barcelona and the atmosphere he creates. Personally this one wasn't as solid as the first and the ending was too nebulous for my taste. I'm more of a concrete reader. However, I love a bibliophiles' tale and didn't realize until I was doing an Amazon search that there is a freebie Kindle called The Rose Of Fire, which is a short background on the origins of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, which takes place during the Inquisition. Sounds like FUN! ...more In The Angel\u2019s Game Zafon returns us to the Barcelona of his prior novel, Shadow of the Wind .

Vidal later pushes him out of the newspaper so he can work for a pair of unscrupulous publishers of penny-dreadfuls. David is wildly successful at that as well, but pines to do more substantive writing. He is approached by a mysterious man and offered an opportunity to escape his situation by writing an unusual book. Will success and comfort cost David his soul? No, really, his soul. He is driven by mourning for a lost love, and drawn to a house with a dark history. Zafon take us on a tour of early 20th century Barcelona. We see a city every bit as interesting as Dickens\u2019 London. There are spooky houses, possibly haunted ones, criminal-infested alleys, an eerie man-made lake, plenty of dark corners and things that go bump. He offers a Dickensian array of characters\u2014in fact, Great Expectations is referenced specifically several times\u2014as Martin tries to figure out the mystery of the house and the real motivation behind his mysterious publisher. There are sinister policemen pursuing him for crimes he did not commit, lies and liars who try to misdirect him, angelic people who try to help him, and some exciting, Hitchcock-like scenes of high-altitude peril. I did not pay obsessive attention to the details of Zafon\u2019s story so if there are logical errors, I did not note them. A small gripe. It happens too much that simple communication between people or characters could have dispelled years of emotional turmoil. I did find myself wishing a less buttoned up environment on some of Zafron\u2019s people. Recognizing that in this time in this place, speaking the heart was a bit less done than it might be today, one can make allowances, but still, the urge remains to shout some encouragement or criticism. \u201cGeez, man, get off your ass and tell her how you feel.\u201d Spleen vented. The Angel\u2019s Game dabbles in the mystical, which fits in with the foggy atmosphere of the tale. I could have done with a bit more explanation, though. Above all, The Angel\u2019s Game is a fun read. Set aside your disbelief, curl up in a cushy chair, open the window to let early morning fog drift in and enjoy. ...more Everything is a tale, Martin.

And while I loved The Shadow of the Wind because of the story, I enjoyed The Angel\u2019s Game primarily because of its protagonist, David Martin. I really can\u2019t properly describe why I love Zaf\u00f3n as a writer; you truly need to read him to understand. His words are so powerful, and his books so atmospheric; when I\u2019m reading one of his books I feel like I belong to that Barcelona of the early 20th century. To me, he\u2019s special because he so skillfully combines genres. In fact, I\u2019d dare say that Zaf\u00f3n transcends genres , his books belong to a category of their own. Here you\u2019ll find it all: history, tragedy, mystery, romance, comedy \u2026 Every work of art is aggressive, Isabella. And every artist's life is a small war or a large one, beginning with oneself and one's limitations. To achieve anything you must first have ambition and then talent, knowledge, and finally the opportunity. Now, there are two main reasons why I loved this book so much and two tiny little things that bothered me. First the good; the writing is simply remarkable . I loved the pacing, the dialogues, the characters. I love the fact that despite this being a gothic novel, it doesn\u2019t lack humor. The second reason is the protagonist \u2013 David Martin. I loved him even more than Daniel Sempere, from the Shadow . Furthermore, what I didn\u2019t like that much was the forced love story between Cristina and David. I personally found no sparks between the two and I thought Cristina was so grumpy and moody. On the other hand, I absolutely loved Isabella . Her conversations with David (her Mr. Rochester) were among my favorites in the novel. Life had taught her that we all require big and small lies in order to survive, just as much as we need air. She used to say that if during one single day, from dawn to dusk, we could see the naked reality of the world, and of ourselves, we would either take our own lives or lose our minds. This book touches upon magical realism at times, and if, like me, you\u2019re generally not the biggest fan, I think it\u2019s better to be prepared beforehand \u2013 you might not get all the answers after you finish this book. And finally, that ending needs to be addressed. I can see why some readers were left confused and thought the ending was ambiguous and unsatisfactory. I have to agree that the last 100 pages were not as good as the rest of the novel; I loved the build-up, but I believe the novel could\u2019ve been wrapped up more nicely. Who is in fact Andreas Corelli? (view spoiler) [Is he an angel or the devil? Or perhaps just a fragment of Martin\u2019s imagination? (hide spoiler) ] Nevertheless, the story does not end here. All three books from The Cemetery of Forgotten Books are related. Now, having read the Angel , some things from the Shadow are clearer to me; just as you will fully understand this book (and Martin\u2019s fate) if you read The Prisoner of Heaven too. (view spoiler) [If you must know now: we learn that Martin is mentally unstable, and I think that here he was a unreliable narrator of sorts. Corelli might not have even been real. And we also realize just how strong his and Isabella\u2019s friendship had been. I really wanted the two of them together\u2026but, that ship has sailed. (hide spoiler) ] In conclusion, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend this book (and any other by Zaf\u00f3n) to everyone who loves books, who lives and breathes them. With his books you will feel at home and be reminded as to why you read; because as he says: Truth is always hidden in fiction. ...more I really did not understood this book, I don't know how it connects to the first one (or maybe it's been many months since I read the first book in the series that I have forgotten certain aspects of the books).

And, before I go on, I will say I had a busy month--I got a job and so I didn't have the sort of dedication I might have been able to provide if still unemployed (that's the ONLY time I will mention unemployment with any sort of wistful tones). Where The Shadow of the Wind took me a week and a half, tops, this book took me a month, so perhaps that's largely due to my preoccupations. Nonetheless--I got to the last few pages of this book and flatly didn't get it. While SotW had a deeply involved plot and multitude of characters, I loved them all and each fit neatly into the scope of things. The Angel's Game left me wondering WHO they all were, WHY they were running around, ruining David Martin's life--and How they'd all gotten there in the first place. Frankly it was a shock: same literary tactics and basic genre of book as SotW, yet it was completely ineffective, as opposed to its remarkable continuation. WHY???? Yes, Barcelona is still magical, and the fantastic Cemetery of Forgotten books appears, ready to ensnare literati with images of dark passage ways, nooks, crannies and best of all--BOOKS, and rare ones at that. But, even Zafon's version of Shakespeare and Co. times a 100 couldn't draw me in fully. Who is Marlesca and who is Corelli? If he truly is the devil, unlike SotW's more subtle Lain/Carax and the implication we're all our own demons--why is that never really made clear? What is IN the tower house behind the clay wall and wardrobe (and, a wardrobe? Really?)? The author, apparently an accomplished musician, wrote a score for this book. I've yet to hear it, but, though I love music, perhaps this is the ultimate indication no one can multi-task. This book COULD have been just as wondrous as Zafon's book before it--but it seems rushed and faithless--there is no mental thrill to this book and no dark spots in anyone's souls. Instead, The Angel's Game is more two-dimensional--people are truly evil. There's no mention of how they became that way, or why--they just, very simply, are fallen angels who elude to their fall from grace through domestic nuances, though a seven year-old could understand \"my father kicked me out before I was ready.\" I've read criticisms that The Shadow of the Wind was hard to follow, and the character base too extensive. I beg to differ. If the characters have life, there is no such thing as too many. The world is filled with people, and if each one is individual, they all have a place. But this book lacked depth, and the characters turned into a giant dark blob. I haven't had time to effectively mourn for this book--I will have to re-read it first to confirm my fears, but I'm pretty sure this was a dud. I snatch up any gothic/book/historian themed novel I can find--as they are the very best to get lost in. I even like the mediocre ones, just because I love this type of book--but the 13th Tale was better, The Secret of Lost Things was better. This is like...The Basic 8 after reading The Secret History and Crash Topics. Let. Down. ...more \"Un escritor nunca olvida la primera vez que acepta unas monedas o un elogio a cambio de una historia.

Un escritor est\u00e1 condenado a recordar ese momento, porque para entonces ya est\u00e1 perdido y su alma tiene precio\". As\u00ed empieza el El Juego del \u00c1ngel , una historia de escritores malditos, escritores obsesivos, editores misteriosos y encargos macabros; una historia de locura, de alucinaciones, de amor, pasi\u00f3n, miedo e incertidumbre. Este segundo libro de la tetralog\u00eda de El Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados , situado temporalmente antes de La Sombra del Viento , nos cuenta la historia de David Mart\u00edn, un chico que siempre quiso ser escritor y lo logr\u00f3 empezando desde lo m\u00e1s bajo. Primero escribi\u00f3 una novela por entregas en un diario gracias a su \"mecenas\" Pedro Vidal, luego pas\u00f3 a a escribir novelas mensuales de a peseta bajo el pseud\u00f3nimo de Ignatius B. Samson en una editorial de medio pelo y, finalmente, se aventur\u00f3 a escribir una novela bajo su verdadero nombre... que fue un fracaso. Tras este fiasco, David se hunde en su miseria descubriendo que tiene c\u00e1ncer y que su gran amor, Cristina, se va a casar con su mejor amigo y mecenas. En medio de este caos, aparece un misterioso personaje: Andreas Corelli. Este hombre de aura macabra y misteriosa se presenta como un afamado editor que quiere pagarle para que escriba un libro por encargo. Tras muchos dudas y desconfianza, y sin nada m\u00e1s qu\u00e9 perder, David acepta s\u00f3lo para verse sorprendido por la petici\u00f3n de este curioso hombre. Corelli quiere que Mart\u00edn escriba una nueva religi\u00f3n, que cree un libro tan poderoso y cuya cosmolog\u00eda sea tan profunda y verdadera, que se constituya como un libro sagrado base de una nueva ideolog\u00eda, de nuevos dioses, de nuevos adeptos y de nuevas crueldades. A partir de ese momento, el libro se desarrollar\u00e1 entre encuentros macabros con el editor, investigaciones sobre el pasado de los personajes, el deterioro de la mente de David Mart\u00edn y la certeza de que lo que el personaje principal est\u00e1 viviendo ya ha sucedido antes y se est\u00e1 acercando a un destino fatal. De nuevo, con El Juego del \u00c1ngel Zaf\u00f3n crea una historia sin precedentes, con tantos personajes y l\u00edneas de trama que piensas que es imposible unir y, sin embargo, \u00e9l lo logra. Con la narraci\u00f3n de Zaf\u00f3n, te adentras en la mente de un personaje que la mitad del tiempo no sabes si est\u00e1 cuerdo o loco. A la par que David Mart\u00edn, ves el alcance de los tent\u00e1culos de la encarnaci\u00f3n de Lucifer cuando de sacar de en medio a las personas que no sirven se trata. A trav\u00e9s de unos ojos en los que no sabes si puedes confiar, conoces al se\u00f1or Sempere, a Isabella, a Cristina, a los inspectores y al se\u00f1or Vidal. El Juego del \u00c1ngel es un libro que no deja de jugar con tu cabeza, pues nunca puedes confiar en lo que se narra. \u00bfSer\u00e1 verdad o una alucinaci\u00f3n? \u00bfExiste esta Barcelona embrujada del Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados o todo est\u00e1 sucediendo en la cabeza de un escritor de novelas de a peseta? <---A>Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n</---A> es un maestro a la hora de contar esta historia y no s\u00f3lo por la incertidumbre que te genera leerla, sino por las conexiones y los gui\u00f1os que se van notando y van haciendo de anclas entre un libro y otro. No puedo dejar de mencionar aqu\u00ed a uno de mis personajes favoritos de toda esta serie de libros: Isabella Gispert. La primera vez que le\u00ed El Juego del \u00c1ngel fue hace ya unos 6 u 8 a\u00f1os y, por loco que parezca, no me gustaba mucho mi nombre en ese momento. No lo odiaba, s\u00f3lo que lo sent\u00eda como meh... . Sin embargo, despu\u00e9s de leer esta historia de Zaf\u00f3n y encontrar en Isabella Gispert una chica so\u00f1adora, fuerte, amante de las letras y los libros, terca como ella sola y con un esp\u00edritu tenaz, me dio much\u00edsimo gusto compartir su nombre. Isabella es esa chica que no se rinde ante nada, que esconde sus sentimientos hasta el \u00faltimo momento y, cuando los revela, ama con todo lo que tiene. Isabella, al igual que Ferm\u00edn en el libro pasado, es esa chispa, esa luz en medio de toda esta oscuridad de una Barcelona que respira guerra y represi\u00f3n.

Apesar de saber que os livros deste autor anteriores \u00e0 Sombra do Vento (como p.ex. Marina) tinham esta componente sobrenatural, estava convencida que com este livro Zaf\u00f3n tinha entrado numa nova fase da sua escrita, onde o sobrenatural j\u00e1 n\u00e3o tinha lugar. Assim, e apesar de, ao longo deste livro, acontecerem coisas para as quais n\u00e3o me parecia poss\u00edvel haver uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o racional, mantive a esperan\u00e7a, at\u00e9 ao \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo, que o autor conseguisse dalguma forma dar a volta a essas incongru\u00eancias, o que acabou por n\u00e3o acontecer.

After being swept away by The Shadow of the Wind (although I read it almost 6 years ago), I was disappointed. I didn't like he repetition of metaphors (there are \"tears\" of many different kinds through the book, lots of things \"catch fire\", etc.) and the feeling that, sometimes, the story dragged (though the short chapters help to keep the pace). But, above all, I didn't like the supernatural element, on which I wasn't counting, since this book follows TSOTW (in spite of the story being chronologically previous to that one), where the strangest events ended up having a rational explanation. Despite knowing that previous books by this author (like Marina, for instance) had this supernatural component, I was convinced that with TSOTW Zaf\u00f3n had begun a new phase in his writing, where supernatural had no place anymore. So, although in this book several things happen to which I didn't think there was a rational explanation, I kept hoping, till the last chapter, that the author somehow managed to turn it around, but it wasn't so. So, I kinda liked it, but I wasn't thrilled. Let's see how things go in The Prisoner of Heaven. ...more Cheguei a O Jogo do Anjo por osmose liter\u00e1ria.

I don't think all of my questions may have been answered, but I think we are meant to assume certain things just were sure to be related.<+++>El juego del \u00e1ngel</+++>", "Title": "El juego del \u00e1ngel"},
