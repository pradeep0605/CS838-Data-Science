Alternatively, you could choose a more expedite path. If instead of rummaging through tons of printed paper one could find a capsule of uncorrupted and distilled Shakespeare, would you not pick this? And this is what Bill Bryson offers us with his book, Shakespeare The World as Stage. Why another biography on WS? Bryson himself says that the world does not need yet another biography but the series Eminent Lives by Harper-Collins did.<---F> And we are glad they did</---F>. They define this biography series according to Strachey\u2019s stated objective of: \u201cTo preserve a becoming brevity which excludes everything that is redundant and nothing that is significant\u201d. Bryson has then set himself to follow Strachey\u2019s (<---B>and Harper-Collins</---B>) recommendation. He has strived \u201cto see how much of WS we can know, really know, from the record\u201d. In an almost investigative style and in a clear and dispassionate fashion, he presents to us in an orderly chronology the evidence that he has extracted. He also presents samples of the musings and multiple conjectures that have sprouted generously. But then, without much ado, dismisses them in a very elegant, and sometimes funny, way. So, his conclusion is that as so very little is known his book can be only 196 pages long. In reality there is some sugar and other flavors added to the capsule, for we can also taste quite a bit of extraneous material, such as Shakespeare\u2019s times and places. We get to hear about urban development and palaces in London, about the state of its hygiene and health, about life expectancy and children death-rate, about the set-up of schools and academic curricula, about the making of books and theatrical practices, and about the functioning of the legal system, etc. For a better assimilation of the capsule, Bryson needs to correct our modern expectations, and remind us that to know so little about a sixteenth century craftsman is nothing out of the ordinary. Most of the material from the sixteenth century has been lost. What is most miraculous about surviving in Shakespeare is that, given the frightful odds, he withstood childhood and got to be an adult. Bryson insists on the very exceptional situation that so much of his works have survived, and this is thanks to the initiative of two of WS\u2019s friends and colleagues, Henry Condell and John Heminges, who decided to publish the First Folio posthumously. The parts I enjoyed most were the discussion on the various remaining First Folios, and particularly the last chapter, the one on the Claimants. All success stories invite detractors. These come across as really foolish. We should be glad that Harper-Collins chose Bryson, whose writing style, so very limpid and fluid and clear, is entirely suitable for the making of this capsule. But of course, the capsule has not entirely satisfied my appetite. My curiosity has now been awoken and it will continue to sniff around the World and Stage of William Shakespeare. ...more A short, witty, highly readable biography of the Bard by one of the our best beloved writers. Bryson doesn't go incredibly in-depth with this work but I applaud him on that. A lot of biographies can be bogged down by completely unnecessary information which causes the page number to rise to the thousands. This 200-page biog contains about as much information as we casual readers need on Shakespeare. I would definitely include it on a list as one of my most enjoyable biographies in recent memory. This audiobook was a perfect companion for a long road trip.

Bill Bryson, who has now written books on everything from the history of the universe to the origins of our domesticity to America in the 1920s and, perhaps most endearingly, stories of his various travels around the world, here turns his attention to William Shakespeare. In this relatively slim volume (it's less than 200 pages), Bryson researched what few facts are known about Shakespeare and synthesized them into chapters on his childhood, his \"lost years\" (1585-1592), his time in London, his plays, his fame, his death and, finally, the strange claims that Shakespeare did not write the works attributed to him. Like most Americans, I was first introduced to Shakespeare in high school, when we read Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and a few of his sonnets. I've read more of his plays since then, but until now I have never read a biography of the man himself. After reading Bryson's book, I feel like I know as much as any modern person can know, simply because so few facts have survived. One Shakespeare scholar told Bryson that \"every Shakespeare biography is 5 percent fact and 95 percent conjecture.\" Even the few surviving portraits that are purportedly of Shakespeare cannot be verified. \"The paradoxical consequence is that we all recognize a likeness of Shakespeare the instant we see one, and yet we don't really know what he looked like. It is like this with nearly every aspect of his life and character: He is at once the best known and least known of figures.\" I liked reading the details of Shakespeare's life, but I think my favorite chapter was the last one on Claimants. Bryson thinks he has identified the person that started what he calls the anti-Shakespeare sentiment, an American woman named Delia Bacon. Bacon became convinced that Francis Bacon actually wrote Shakespeare's plays, and in 1852 she traveled to England to try to prove that Shakespeare was a fraud. Of course, there is no evidence of this, nor of any other claimants writing Shakespeare's works, but some researchers continue to come up with theories. Bryson picks apart the claims and shows what little merit there is to them. \"The one thing all the competing theories have in common is the conviction that William Shakespeare was in some way unsatisfactory as an author of brilliant plays. This is really quite odd. Shakespeare's upbringing, as I hope this book has shown, was not backward or in any way conspicuously deprived. His father was the mayor of a consequential town. In any case, it would hardly be a unique achievement for someone brought up modestly to excel later in life. Shakespeare lacked a university education, to be sure, but then so did Ben Jonson -- a far more intellectual playwright -- and no one ever suggests that Jonson was a fraud ... When we reflect upon the works of William Shakespeare it is of course an amazement to consider that one man could have produced such a sumptuous, wise, varied, thrilling, ever-delighting body of work, but that is of course the hallmark of genius. Only one man had the circumstances and gifts to give us such incomparable works, and William Shakespeare of Stratford was unquestionably that man -- whoever he was.\" I would heartily recommend this book to fans of English literature and history. It has Bryson's trademark dry wit and humorous phrasings, so Bryson fans should also be satisfied. The audio CD I had also included an interview with the author, which was delightful, as expected. On a more alarming note, I'm nearly out of Bryson books to read. Now that will be the winter of my discontent. ...more I am not a big fan of either audio books or Shakespeare, but I needed a short something to listen to recently.

My best memory of learning about Shakespeare was being asked to write an essay on the use of natural symbolism in \"A Winters Tale\". Being a slightly cocky and beligerent teenager I turned in an essay entitled \"Why Shakespeare is literatures greatest plagiarist\", obviously this was not well received but having read this book I think some of my points were pretty salient. This book essentially poses more questions rather than answers; Was Shakespeare gay? Did he really wear an earring? Are any of the paintings of him actually, you know, him? How should we really spell his name? Where was he a lot of the time? What's up with only leaving your missus a second rate bed? I suppose the answer nowadays is, who really cares apart from some very obsessed academics? The main thing is to appreciate the legacy we were left and to use the words he created to the fullest! ...more This is a very strange and frustrating book: it reads like a lighthearted text book for teenagers - except that it has no index (a cardinal sin for any non-fiction book). It is about a wordsmith, but the first chapter focuses on what he may have looked like.

Its mission and content is to tell us about Shakespeare, yet it tells us in exhaustive and repetitive detail that almost nothing is or can be known about the man (\"a wealth of text but poverty of context\"). There are pages of disjointed facts about life in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. Some of them are staggeringly banal (\"At the top of the social heap was the monarch\") and others are weirdly specific (e.g. the laws about hat wearing). All the way through, Bryson alternates between cataloguing all the unknowns of Shakespeare's life and trying to describe it; consequently, his text is heavily sprinkled with \"probably\" and even weaker caveats. It makes it all seem rather pointless and distracts from the few interesting insights he does have. He describes his subject as \"ever elusive\", despite stressing the fact that we know far more about Shakespeare than almost anyone else who lived at that time; equally contradictory is the claim that \"More than for any other writer, Shakespeare's words stand separate from his life\" - but surely we can't know that because, as Bryson keeps saying, we know so little about his life! Bryson identifies three options for researchers in the absence of hard facts: \"pick minutely over legal documents... to speculate... or to persuade themselves they know more than they actually do\". It's not clear which option Bryson took; as he says, \"A devoted reader can find support for nearly any position he or she wishes in Shakespeare\". The only really interesting points were that estimates of Shakespeare's vocabulary are usually huge overestimates because they include each variant of word form and spelling: take, takes, tak'n, taken etc. It's not the size, but what he did with it that mattered; his true skill was as a phrasemaker, demonstrated by the fact that 10% of the entries in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations are from his works. Fortunately this was a quick, easy read. I only read it at the behest of my father-in-law: I am not a big Bryson fan, rarely read biographies and am not a huge history enthusiast either. Reading it has not changed those preferences. ...more (Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com:].

No matter where on the planet you're from, it seems that there is at least one figure from the early Renaissance period (1400-1600 AD) who's had a huge and profound impact on your society's culture ever since: here in the English-speaking world, for example, that would be playwright and poet William Shakespeare , and in fact it's guessed that a huge majority of all new novels and movies coming out in English these days are based or inspired in one way or another on something from \"The Bard\"s old works. But that's the ultimate irony about Shakespeare; that although he is one of the only Elizabethan playwrights in history to have almost all his works preserved and reproduced over the ages (a main factor behind him being as influential as he now is), hardly any facts about the man himself exist, and in fact apart from his creative writing you would scarcely even know he was a physical human who actually once lived. Over the centuries, then, it has led to wild speculation about Shakespeare's life on the part of thousands, and an entire wing of academic study about the man so in the center of all Western artistic thought. So for those like me who hardly know anything about the subject, Bill Bryson's new book <+++>Shakespeare: The World as Stage</+++> is going to be a godsend; it is a tight, funny 200-page overview of what exactly we factually know about the man and what we don't, peppered with a lot of anecdotes about the various crackpots over the years who have gotten obsessed with the question. And in fact this is the entire reason for the book to exist in the first place, is to give a short and tidy overview of a famous person's life; it is in fact the latest installment of James Atlas' \"Eminent Lives\" series, where for years he's been asking intriguing writers in other fields to pen short accessible works about various famous thinkers in history. For example, for those who didn't know, Bryson himself is mostly known in the publishing world for extremely sharp, funny and bitter travelogues; and here he puts that style to good use, taking us from one interesting historical and academic site to the next, as he with us unravels the mystery of this playwright we know so little about. In fact, that's about the only big drawback to this book as well, if you want to look at it that way; that a 200-page manuscript simply isn't enough to fully get into the mysteries behind Shakespeare and his work, and that the main enjoyment Bryson's book contains is with all the astounding trivia-style facts he rattles off throughout. (Did you know that there are only fourteen words in existence actually written in Shakespeare's hand? That of 3,000 plays written in the Elizabethan Era, we only have printed copies of 200 of them, with nearly 40 of them being from Shakespeare himself? That his collected work contains 884,647 words, 15,785 question marks, and 10 instances of the term \"dunghill?\") As far as I'm concerned, though, that's what's to like about this book, not dislike; it's no scholarly treatise by any means, but Bryson's Shakespeare is definitely a pleasant little unintimidating ladder into the endless underground cavern which is Shakespearean study. And given that other titles in this series deal with such other fascinating characters from history as Thomas Jefferson, Muhammad, and Machiavelli, I'm also looking forward to reading more.

With The World as Stage , Bryson has succumbed to the lure of adding to the groaning shelves of Shakespeare biography, with the excuse (if he needs one) that herein will lie only what is known beyond doubt. Shakespeare biography is, he tells us, 90% conjecture, and about 5% fact; here he tries to gather together \"just the facts\" (I said that, he didn't), and talk about where they originated and about the conjecture they've sparked and the probabilities therein. For example, he begins with the visual image of Shakespeare as we know it. He efficiently dissects the three images most closely associated with him, the three on which all others are based: the Chandos portrait (which may not be Shakespeare); the engraving which appeared as the frontispiece of the First Folio (which is bloody awful); and the bust that is part of his memorial (many of the details of which have been obliterated). Did he look like any or all of these? Maybe. What, exactly, did he look like? We don't really know. When was he born, and where? We're not sure. How did he do in school? We don't even know that he went \u2013 though it's probable. How was his marriage to Anne Hathaway? We have no idea \u2013 we don't even know that \"Anne\" was her name; her father's will refers to her as Agnes. I never knew that. And so forth. Data is so very scarce for many reasons. It's been four hundred years; records have deteriorated or gone up in flames; what records there are can be next to impossible to locate and once located to read and/or decipher. Shakespeare's name was spelled dozens of different ways, including by himself, and never \"Shakespeare\". Even with all that, a researcher simply can't expect so very many mentions of Shakespeare in the public record: unless he was getting married, baptizing a child, or involved in an arrest or lawsuit (or dying), there simply would be no official documentation. If for no other reason, I would treasure this book for two things: first was the story of the husband and wife team of Charles and Hulda Wallace who, driven in the early 1900's by the husband's obsession with Shakespeare, spent 18 hour days poring over the public record from Will's lifetime and made some discoveries (and then he lost his mind and went paranoiac and into oil). I know it marks me out as a bit freaky, but I'll admit it anyway: I would give a lot to be able to go and spend 18 hours a day studying cramped and often faded and illegible 16th century documents looking for mentions of Shakespeare. Sounds like a dream job. Seriously. The second gift Bryson gives me in this is the concept that if there really was a Love's Labours Won , there were probably enough copies made that it could still be found one day. (Way to reduce a Shakespeare geek to tears, Bryson.) (Sadly, in the interview which serves as Chapter 10, he contradicts that. But hope springs, and all that.) I call myself a Shakespeare geek, and probably shouldn't; for me it refers to my deep affection and fascination for the man and his work \u2013 thirst for knowledge, not necessarily possession of knowledge. I know more than the average bear, but not enough to truly qualify me as a geek. For example, I had no idea that Will's brother Edmund was an actor (and died at only 27 in the same year as their mother, both of unknown causes). I also didn't know Walt Whitman was a rabid anti-Stratfordian (which Bryson doesn't mention, but which I discovered in related reading.) I do know enough not to trust any single source \u2013 not even Bill Bryson \u2026 Bill Bryson reads his own words, and I enjoy his voice, lightly deep, young and humorous and pleasant. He reads naturally and easily, with healthy pauses where they're needed and not where they are not. And it's fun to listen to the British influence on his accent (he was born in Des Moines, lived there from 1977 to 1995, moved back to the US, then returned to England in '03, where he remains). It's not wholly a British accent, but there is British in it; I feel like Sherlock Holmes tracing his travels through his enunciation, except that I'm going about it backwards. Much as I enjoy Bryson's reading, though, I'm not sure audio is the best format for this, for me. For a book like this I need to be able to flip back and see what year the will was found, and remind myself of names of the Folger Library archivists Bryson talked to, and how many Shakespeare-related publications he mentioned were there, and so on. It's a lot harder to do this with audio, even the comparatively flexible medium of a digital file on my iPod. Also, I suspect there are illustrations in the tangible editions; there usually is an insert in exactly this sort of book. If for no other reason, I owe Bill Bryson for a wonderful quote which I am adopting. I may have it tattooed somewhere. Written in a letter to a friend upon having written a preface to Delia Bacon's dense and nutty anti-Stratfordian book (without having read it): \"This shall be the last of my benevolent follies, and I will never be kind to anybody again as long as I live.\" ~ Nathaniel Hawthorne. (In L.M. Montgomery, the only people who share my last name are nasty cows. In The World as Stage , the city of my birth is the home and gravesite of Delia Bacon. *sigh*) I kind of want to go lay Hawthorne's quote, in illuminated calligraphy and elaborately framed, on her grave. (I just might.) Bryson devotes a chapter \u2013 a funny, sardonic, bubble-popping chapter \u2013 to what is often called the Authorship Question. To wit: that actor guy who couldn't even spell his own name couldn't have written the finest works in the English language. Bryson happily takes that concept apart, and then takes its component pieces apart. I'm a Stratfordian, and \u2026 honestly, as a rock-solid Stratfordian, I'll admit, I have a sneaking affection for the Oxfordian theory of authorship. It's fun. It's balderdash, but it is fun. Not, however as much fun as the Marlovian theory \u2013 who doesn't love the idea of someone faking his death so as to become a better spy, as well as to go off and write the finest plays and poetry the English language has ever produced? I would love to play with that story \u2026 But the Kit-Marlowe-didn't-die-at-Deptford story is mostly wishful thinking for me, because I have an unaccountable fondness for the man. But when all is said and done, I can only marvel at the insistence of so many otherwise intelligent people that Shakespeare could not have had the education or breadth of experience to write his plays. First of all \u2013 no one knows that. Bill Bryson takes great pains to enumerate all the things we do not know about William Shakespeare. (And even at that we know more about him than about 99% of his contemporaries.) Second of all \u2026 A large plank in the platform of many of the Theorists is that the author of the plays has to have been a lawyer because of the extent to which the law is referenced in the plays, and/or has to have traveled extensively because of the non-English settings of so many plays \u2026 et cetera. I can only conclude that the people who hold those beliefs have never written fiction. I know next to nothing about cars, but if I decided to create a character like Mercedes Thompson I could crack a book or talk to a mechanic (or use the internet), and present a reasonable simulation of expertise. I am not now nor ever have been a forensic analyst, but I can talk (within very strict limits) about petechial hemorrhaging and lividity and epithelial cells and loops and whorls and so on without making a total fool of myself, because of exposure to stories about forensic analysts. If I needed more artistic verisimilitude for an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative, I could \u2013 again \u2013 crack a book or talk to a CSI (or wander the internet). If I want to set a book in Katmandu, I don't have to go there; it's a wonderful thing to be able to do so, but - - it's called \"research\". Oddly, it's an defense I haven't seen used in what I've read about the Authorship Question. It just seems so obvious\u2026 Shakespeare was not writing in a vacuum, all alone and armed only with his own direct experience. If fiction was written under those rules, science fiction, fantasy, most mystery, and a large percentage of non-subgenre novels would be impossible. In Bird by Bird , Anne Lamott writes a wonderful account of calling up a local vintner to ask what the wire gadget is called that anchors the cork in a champagne bottle. As she points out, most people are delighted to talk about their vocations. All those reference to the law? Shakespeare went out and observed, and read, and talked to lawyers. All those Italian settings? Shakespeare went out and read, and talked to sailors and other travelers (and either did not pay close attention or got bad information, as his geography is way off in several cases). Every single one of the objections that \"Shakespeare couldn't have known that\" can be knocked down with two simple sentences: \"We don't know what he knew\", and \"If he didn't know, he asked\". It's just all so foolish. What's rather alarming, reading about the theories, is reading in turn about this new movie that came out right around the time I listened to this, \"Anonymous\". (Which, not to be obtuse about it,\tis rather an idiotic name, isn't it, if the theory is that in order to disseminate his work Edward DeVere made use of some guy named Shakespeare as a front for the plays? They're not by \"Anonymous\", after all.) It was part of the Oxfordian cabal's arsenal \u2013 and the worrying bit was that they spread high school and college study guides as far and wide as they could. Not, from what I understand, insisting that DeVere was actually the author, but raising the question suggestively. \"Make your own decision,\" they seem to say, \"was it Sir Edward DeVere 17th Earl of Oxford \u2026 or was it that guy Wilm Shaksper whose father made gloves?\" In the end, for me the Authorship Question has the kind of interest of one of those alternate histories: what if the South had won the Civil War, or if Hitler had won WWII? Or (not that I've seen this one, yet) what if the moon really was made of green cheese? The South and Hitler didn't, and the moon isn't, and while what-if's are entertaining, they're not otherwise productive. And, in the end, did the world desperately need one more book about Shakespeare? Well, no. But am I for one happier because Bill Bryson wrote one? Yeah. I am. And for heaven's sake, Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare. ...more Only one man had the circumstances and gifts to give us such incomparable works, and William Shakespeare of Stratford was unquestionably that man- whoever he was. Shakespeare's biography is sketchy, and ever thus it shall remain. This little book represents Bill Bryson's attempt to collect what scant information exists, and to debunk a few spurious claims. I can't say I know much more about Sweet Will now than I did before reading the book, but Bryson is not to blame. People didn't reliably keep records 400 years ago. There were no standardized spellings for English words, so a lot of what was written down is indecipherable.

There were no standardized spellings for English words, so a lot of what was written down is indecipherable. Furthermore, no one anticipated Shakespeare's enduring popularity, so they weren't clamoring to write his biography while he was still alive. In fact, \"playwriting was not an esteemed profession, and its practice, however accomplished, gained one little critical respect.\" It's a wonder Will's works survived at all. If not for the dedicated efforts of John Heminges and Henry Condell in compiling the First Folio, eighteen of Shakespeare's plays would probably have been lost to us. Imagine our world without Macbeth, Julius Caesar, Twelfth Night, As You Like It, The Tempest, Antony and Cleopatra , and a dozen others. It's our good fortune that Heminges and Condell weren't procrastinators. Both men were dead by 1630, only seven years after the First Folio was published. Bryson succeeds admirably in providing a context for Shakespeare's life and works. He describes what was happening in England throughout The Bard's lifetime, and how those events and attitudes might have shaped his choices and influenced his writing. For instance, the issue of Queen Elizabeth's succession was a national preoccupation for much of Shakespeare's life. It's no surprise, then, that one quarter of his plays deal with questions of royal succession. Don't be put off by my three-star rating. I'm not enough of a snob to think of 3 stars as a \"low\" rating. It means \"I liked it.\" Nothing more, nothing less. I've always found English history to be rather dry, but I'm glad I read the book. It will add a new layer of subtext to my future reading of Shakespeare's works. Just knowing that audience members were sometimes allowed to sit on the stage during a performance alters my perspective. How distracting that must have been for the actors! Imagine allowing that on Broadway. My favorite chapter was the last one, entitled \"Claimants,\" in which the author presents an array of stunningly ridiculous and insupportable claims regarding the authorship of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets. Bryson gave free rein to his famous wit in this chapter. I found myself laughing hysterically at some of his observations. Regarding the popular claim that Christopher Marlowe wrote Shakespeare's works, Bryson dryly concedes that Marlowe \"had the requisite talent, and would certainly have had ample leisure after 1593, assuming he wasn't too dead to work .\" (Italics mine.) After handily dismissing all the myths for lack of evidence, Bryson concludes: \"Only one man had the circumstances and gifts to give us such incomparable works, and William Shakespeare of Stratford was unquestionably that man--whoever he was.\" ...more OMG! :) :) :) It's a bright breezy Big Bill Bryson book about Bill!!!!!!!!!! :) I hope I'm not maligning Bryson more than is strictly speaking necessary by saying this feels like a book one could write in a week or three via google.

Black is the badge of hell, The hue of dungeons, and the school of night; And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well. he says 'What exactly he means by 'the school of the night' is really anybody's guess.' This suggests to me a complete ignorance of the idea of The School of Night which for a period kept some academics in wages and the masses like me entertained. It's a lovely romantic idea that completely fits the period. Indeed, Cambridge University Press saw fit to reissue The School of Night A Study in the Literary Relationships of Sir Walter Ralegh by M. C. Bradbrook as recently as 2011. It's no wonder Bryson's book is so short. Rest here: https://alittleteaalittlechat.wordpre... ...more There's nothing wrong with Bryson's writing... but he just doesn't say very much, because there ISN'T anything to say. Apparently NOBODY knows anything interesting about Shakespeare's life or personality -- all we have are 3 bad portraits (one sketch from memory, one statue that was whitewashed of all detailed features, and one decent portrait that might be of someone else entirely); a few legal documents (with only 6 signatures, 3 of which may have been forged for him since he was too ill to wr There's nothing wrong with Bryson's writing... but he just doesn't say very much, because there ISN'T anything to say. Apparently NOBODY knows anything interesting about Shakespeare's life or personality -- all we have are 3 bad portraits (one sketch from memory, one statue that was whitewashed of all detailed features, and one decent portrait that might be of someone else entirely); a few legal documents (with only 6 signatures, 3 of which may have been forged for him since he was too ill to write much then); almost nothing whatsoever about his wife (except her name and date of death); etc, etc... Nobody even interviewed his surviving relatives and friends about him -- the first biography came out a hundred years after his death and has been proved to be mostly wrong anyway. So you can't get any image of this guy at all, unless you read way too far into his plays/sonnets and assume that he's speaking as himself (which, if you try it, just gets you tons of contradictions). Oh, and even the plays/poems themselves -- there's no real definitive version: he never published his works himself, so all the versions we have are either heavily edited by his contemporaries or bad transcriptions by audience members. It almost seems useless to think of Shakespeare as a person -- he's more of a social construct, a general name used to link together \"his\" plays/sonnets. Finally, at least so far, Bryson has had very little to say about WHY Shakespeare is considered such a genius today. If we don't know shit about the guy and can't even agree on whether he wrote some of the plays he did, then please at least discuss why people think the plays themselves are so hot. But he just repeats the same general blurbage (\"genius\", \"masterpieces\", etc) without analyzing what's so great about it. PS -- there's an interesting book, Highbrow Lowbrow , that talks about how Shakespeare's plays used to be general popular entertainment (at least throughout the States, performed to cheering and heckling crowds, interspersed with cheesy stuff like minstrel music or trained animals between acts) before somehow they transitioned into their current state as some kind of delicate art that needs to be protected from the public, where you're barely allowed to cough during a performance, and where kids fall asleep to it in class. So it's always been \"valued\", just in different ways... I wish Bryson would have pursued how those ways have changed over time. ...more From my limited experience with author biographies, I've learned that the less I know about an author, the happier I am. Thankfully (or regretfully, perhaps), I or anyone else is at little risk of having the Bard's work spoilt by too much biographical information of its creator. The aim of this slender book is to collect all of what we know about Shakespeare, which is precious little indeed. What did Shakespeare look like? We don't know. There are three portraits that are \"the best\". But two of From my limited experience with author biographies, I've learned that the less I know about an author, the happier I am. Thankfully (or regretfully, perhaps), I or anyone else is at little risk of having the Bard's work spoilt by too much biographical information of its creator. The aim of this slender book is to collect all of what we know about Shakespeare, which is precious little indeed. What did Shakespeare look like? We don't know. There are three portraits that are \"the best\". But two of them were done after his death and the other (the only one done during his lifetime) may be of someone else entirely. We don't even know how to spell his name, though it appears that neither did he. \"Shakespeare\" was the standard spelling of the time, but in the six surviving signatures we have from his own hand, he didn't spell it the same way twice. So, was he Willm Shakp, William Shaksp\u0113r, Wm Shaksp\u0113, William Shakspere, Willm Shakspere, or William Shakspeare? So most of his biography comes down to context. In lieu of what we know about the man himself, we can study the world he inhabited. For instance, we know that upon crossing London Bridge, he may have seen the impaled head of Guy Fawkes and his co-conspirators displayed on a spike. He probably drank ale for breakfast and may have developed a taste for potatoes, only recently imported to his homeland from South America. He may have enjoyed leisurely games of skittles on a bowling green on a Sunday afternoon. But there are a few details we know with relative certainty. He was an Englishman. He had a wife, two daughters, and a son who died young. He died in April of 1616, shortly after finishing his will, in which he left his wife only his second best bed, a fact that strikes me as both hilarious and deeply sad. Most importantly, however, we know that this Shakspere fellow wrote some vastly important and deeply beloved literature and it's a blessing and nearly a miracle that we have them. Isn't that the perfect biography, anyway? What else do you really need to know? ...more Fitting in with the Bryson M.O. of saying to himself, \"Gee, I wonder about...\" then following that question with a book, this is a biography about a man about whom, as Bryson reminds us at least once on every page, there is known almost nothing. Yet somehow there are a complete 100-something pages that move briskly and thoroughly. The bio covers what little is factually known about Shakespeare's birth, life, and [spoiler] death.

Yet somehow there are a complete 100-something pages that move briskly and thoroughly. The bio covers what little is factually known about Shakespeare's birth, life, and [spoiler] death. Bryson comes at his subject as a sort of curator, rifling through what is known and inferred about Shakespeare as a man, allowing for detours into epistemological commentary. This becomes a great lens for taking on the larger Elizabethan & Jacobean Englands as a subject. Before anything else, the book is entertaining. (Though in the interest of full disclosure, I am predisposed to think Bill Bryson would entertain even if writing about, say, mosses.) Many people like to call him \"readable.\" I think this readability comes from his talent for choosing exactly the most perfectly efficient words to articulate a given thought. Also contributing is a general tone that drives forward. The only petite gripe is how steadfast Bryson holds onto his position in the Was Shakespeare Really Shakespeare debate. But he supports his view, at least to my standards, adequately. And finally, it just occured to me that Bill Bryson did indeed entertain me when he wrote about mosses: pages 427 - 429 in A Short History of Nearly Everything . ...more This is a great introduction to Shakespeare and probably one of the best biographies you can read about a man we know so much, yet so little about. It explains why facts are missing, what we can conjecture and why people still read and love his work today. \u09ac\u09bf\u09b2 \u09ac\u09b0\u09be\u0987\u09b8\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0

The man can take any subject and make it interesting, simply because he has this unfailing flair for adding details which make you grin. He does so to great effect in Shakespeare , his two-hundred-page biography of the man affectionately known as the Bard, which will delight Shakespeare aficionados as well as people who know virtually nothing about Stratford's most famous export product, such as myself. Two hundred pages is not much for a biography of the world's greatest play I love Bill Bryson.

Two hundred pages is not much for a biography of the world's greatest playwright, but it's enough, because, as Bryson keeps reminding us, preciously little is known about Shakespeare. Bryson himself doesn't really add to the knowledge available on Shakespeare; he has no great discoveries up his sleeve. Basically, what he does is tell us what others have written about Shakespeare, only to tear their theories a new arsehole in a few short, memorable observations that will probably stay with you better than the theories themselves. It's an entertaining approach, which is particularly successful in the final chapter, where Bryson tackles several authors' attempts to prove that the works associated with Shakespeare were not actually written by Shakespeare. On top of pointing out fatal flaws in the various authors' reasoning (often in a single sentence), Bryson observes with great relish that three of the many, many people who have come up with outlandish theories on the authorship of Shakespeare's plays were called Silliman, Battey and Looney. I love details like that, which more serious scholars would be too polite to point out. Bryson takes them and runs with them, making this not just an informative, well-researched book, but a very entertaining one. Shakespeare could have done with some more depth -- a little more information on the plays and their possible inspirations and interpretations. It could also have done with some thorough proof-reading. There are times, especially in the first half of the book, when Bryson loses himself in tangents on Queen Elizabeth and life in sixteenth-century England, some of which are just a tad too random and general for the subject. However, just when you find yourself wondering what all this information has to do with Shakespeare, Bryson gets back on track and comes up with some more interesting observations on the Bard and his times, plus some witty asides to make you forgive his rambling. As a result, the book is a bit uneven, but there is no denying it's a pleasant read on a rainy day, which will likely whet your appetite for some more serious Shakespeare scholarship. It definitely did that for me. Anyone got any recommendations? ...more Shakespeare: The World as a Stage has just GOT to be the liberal arts equivalent of the thesis reports on \" strategic realignment of the organization to external exigencies using a process driven approach and scalable, replicable models that offer long-term sustainability \" that we wrote during my IIM days.

I mean, seriously! An entire book that basically talks about how little there is to talk about what the book is supposed to talk about! The fact is, and this is something that was a bit of an eye-opener for me, we hardly know anything about Shakespeare the person. The master of irony does indeed have the last laugh because we know naught about the most well known playwright in history, whose works have been the best preserved and the most researched. There are Shakespearean scholars who have dedicated entire careers to poring over the number of times the word \"dunghill\" appears in his works (ten times), but nobody knows for certain how \"Shakespeare\" is spelt (Shakespeare himself signed it 6 different ways, but never as \"Shakespeare\"). What Shakespeare: The World as a Stage does provide is: * a context for Shakespeare's works * a rich depiction of common life in Elizabethan England * Bryson's love of quirky facts * Shakespeare's works and his contribution to literature * words and phrases that he coined that are very much part of daily English, and the even more interesting list of words that couldn't catch on to common usage * contemporaries and luminaries who contributed to, derived from, patronised, and built Shakespeare * anecdotes about researchers who've spent careers trying to get to the man behind the name * debunking of quite a few Shakespearean myths and conspiracy theories with their often hilarious lack of proof and logic A quick read, even if I'm now not too sure about shelving this under Biographies. ...more I wish I owned Shakespeare because man, would I be richer than Bill Gates. Bryson's book is okay. It's a quick read and is ideal for any student who is starting at in the study of Shakespeare.

Overall Bryson simply presents the facts and doesn't not speculate or guess (I love what he said about A. L. Rowse ). He has I wish I owned Shakespeare because man, would I be richer than Bill Gates.

Overall Bryson simply presents the facts and doesn't not speculate or guess (I love what he said about A. L. Rowse ). He has read the standard sources, so his book is a good starting point and pointer to deeper sources. I have one quibble, however. While overall Bryson presents a very even handed description of Shakespeare's marriage, he does slip in a strange word. I hade to wonder about the phrase \"considerably older wife\" when describing Ann Hathaway. I wonder if Shakespeare had been eight years older than his bride if Bryson would have used \"considerably older husband\". ...more \"(...)he is a kind of literary equivalent of an electron - forever there and not there.\" Bill Bryson's take on a Shakespeare is a witty commentary to the whole of the mythical author's phenomenon.

I liked the conversational tone. Refreshingly honest, Bryson admits that he has nothing new to say about Shakespeare from the very outset, and in fact spends most of the book demolishing some of the generally accepted facts about Shakespeare, pointing out the lack of evidence. It's useful for a casual reader and the casual interest in Shakespeare, but obviously you'd want to go elsewhere if you have an academic interest in it. It serves as an excellent rundown of what we do know about the Bard, though.

It's useful for a casual reader and the casual interest in Shakespeare, but obviously you'd want to go elsewhere if you have an academic interest in it. It serves as an excellent rundown of what we do know about the Bard, though. He writes clearly and often with humour: a favourite titbit among reviewers is justifiably his pointed comment that Silliman, Looney and Battey are among the surnames rejoiced in by people who theorise that Shakespeare was not really the author of the plays attributed to him. If you have someone in your life who clings to the conspiracy theories about that, and it annoys you, you might consider giving them this book for Bryson's last chapter, in which he makes such theories seem quite silly. There is nothing startling and new here, but for the clarity of Bryson's research and his writing, it's worth it as a casual read. ...more It's more 3.5-4 to be honest. I honestly did enjoy the book, I found it fascinating as I love Shakespeare and love learning about Elizabethan times. However, I expect more from Bill Bryson; he is seen as a very witty, comical writer but none of that shines through in this book. It was nicely written but I found him to be quite pompous in places and simply creating extremely long chapters just to show off his evidence rather than keep to the point.

It's such a splendid book, marvelously written and well-researched. He focuses more on all that we do not know about Shakespeare, and how facts about him have been invented for centuries to fill in gaps. He also reflects on the Elizabethan and Jacobean societies and the role of Shakespeare's work within them. Loved it. Seriously. Adored. **Swoon** A departure from Bryson's usual style and subject matter, Shakespeare: The World as Stage is a more serious tome. Bryson undertakes an 'everyman's' approach to understanding William Shakespeare, his life, the times, motivations, creativity, his additions to the English language that survive him to this day, and so much more. While there is present the humor that is so much a part of Bryson's canon, it is deployed with much more subtlety and without the mockery that is more familiar.

There is much to be gleaned from and fascinated by in Shakespeare: The World as Stage . It just might cause you to run out and buy a copy of Shakespeare's Complete Works. ...more I never expected a biography to be such a quick and entertaining read. But as this particular biography was written by Bill Bryson, of course it would prove to be the exception. I giggled, laughed and chuckled while reading this little gem. It was brilliant. Bill Bryson sets out to tell everything we know about Shakespeare in order to show how much we don't know about Shakespeare. But he also argues that we actually know a lot about Shakespeare considering the general lack of information from the I never expected a biography to be such a quick and entertaining read. But as this particular biography was written by Bill Bryson, of course it would prove to be the exception. I giggled, laughed and chuckled while reading this little gem. It was brilliant. Bill Bryson sets out to tell everything we know about Shakespeare in order to show how much we don't know about Shakespeare. But he also argues that we actually know a lot about Shakespeare considering the general lack of information from the 16th century. We only feel it's odd that we don't know more about Shakespeare, because we desperately want to know more of his personal life and writing. Bryson's book therefore mostly dwells upon facts (documents Shakespeare have signed, his plays, houses he has purchased and historical events), and Bryson never attempts any high-flown speculation or analysis. He simply admits that no one knew what Shakespeare was doing in the years of 1585\u20131592 and therefore it is impossible for anyone to say more about that. My favorite part of this book was perhaps the last chapter, in which Bryson attacks the many attempts to dismiss Shakespeare as the author of the legendary plays. Bryson takes the myths one by one and dismisses them with humor and irony. Such as: \u201c A third candidate for Shakespearean authorship was Christopher Marlowe. He was the right age (just two months older than Shakespeare), had the requisite talent, and would certainly have had ample leisure after 1593, assuming he wasn't too dead to work. \u201d It is simply hilarious! I really enjoyed Bryson's writing style and this was a good and educational book to read about one of the most influential (and mythic?) authors of all time. The three stars in this review simply stands for genuine entertainment - nothing less and nothing more. ...more Bill Bryson has written an entertaining, humorous biography of Shakespeare. There is little concrete evidence about Shakespeare's life four hundred years ago since few records were kept, spelling was not standardized, and many records were destroyed by fire. The book gives us an overview of British history of the era, the history of the theater at that time, and where Shakespeare probably fit into it.

The book gives us an overview of British history of the era, the history of the theater at that time, and where Shakespeare probably fit into it. Shakespeare gave the English language new words that have never been heard before, especially by attaching \"un-\" prefixes to existing words to create new words such as unmask, unhand, unlock, etc. He also was a phrasemaker and is responsible for phrases we use today such as \"vanish into thin air\", \"bag and baggage\", \"play fast and loose\", \"the milk of human kindness\", etc. Plays were owned by the theater companies that produced them. It is fortunate that John Heminges and Henry Condell printed a folio editon of his works seven years after Shakespeare's death. Bryson devotes a chapter to the controversy of whether Shakespeare actually wrote the plays attributed to him. He gives good reasons why Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, the Earl of Oxford, and others could not have been the author of Shakespeare's plays. Bryson's view of Marlowe as the author of Shakespeare's plays was summed up, \"He was the right age (just two months older than Shakespeare), had the requisite talent, and would certainly have had ample leisure after 1593, assuming he wasn't too dead to work.\" Bryson has such an enjoyable style of writing that the reader feels that they are having a conversation about Shakespeare with him. Bryson does not pretend to be a Shakespeare scholar, and does not analyze his works. But he has given the reader a good foundation about his subject, and there are plenty of scholarly books out there for anyone who wants more information. ...more SHAKESPEARE: The World as Stage.

Among the words first found in Shakespeare \u201care abstemious, antipathy, critical, frugal, dwindle, horrid, vast,\u201d etc. A surprisingly large number of these words did gain common currency and about eight hundred are still used today. His real gift was as a phrasemaker, and caused many phrases to enter the common language. \u201cAmong them: one fell swoop, vanish into thin air, bag and baggage, play fast and loose,\u201d etc. The list goes on. Shakespeare quotes take up fully one-tenth of the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. Bryson also manages to dig up some interesting facts to keep us interested. One such was the printing history of the First Folio. It\u2019s estimated that about 750 copies were printed of this edition. Of those, about 300 still survive today \u2013 the majority being in the Folger Library in Washington, D. C. Bryson even covers that school of \u201cscholars\u201d who claim that Shakespeare couldn\u2019t have written those plays, and summarily deals with them. In all, I found this short exposition to well written and very interesting. Recommended. ...more", "Title": "Shakespeare: The World as Stage"},
