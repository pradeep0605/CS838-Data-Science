You're welcome. That bloody shrimping cover ! What the bloody shrimping fish?! Why the holy barnacle does Mercy have to display her boobs like that?! Because her being a mechanic makes her less feminine, and she has to reassert her womanly womanhood by flaunting her freaking assets?! Just in case the readers have a doubt as to whether she is male of female? Or is it just that is it super HAWT (both literally and figuratively) in Washington State and our dear girl just NEEDS to keep her work coveralls open at all times? You know, for the sake of ventilation and stuff ? Right. I'm sure that's what this is about. Damn I hate that kind of crap. The cover would have been just as hot way hotter, had Mercy shown just a little cleavage . Because, YES, a chick can look hot in coveralls even when she is NOT showing off her boobs ! This probably comes as a shock, I know. I'm sorry I had to break it to you so brutally ,<---M> my Little Barnacles</---M>, but you couldn't be left in the dark any longer. Your mental sanity was at stake here, whether you realize it or not. Someone had to do something about it! Why you're very welcome, my dears. I absolutely lurve that cute kitty, by the way. You know my tastes so well, it's touching, really (view spoiler) [*summons Fleet Admiral DaShrimp* \"DaShrimp, nuke those Silly Barnacles NOW! No one throws cute kitties at me and gets away with it unscathed!\" (hide spoiler) ] Anyway , I know exactly what happened here. This was yet an evilly cunning plan to demolish a book by its cover, courtesy of the lovely people at Ace. They've been doing such a wonderful job of it with Ilona Andrews' books, they just couldn't resist the temptation here! They just had to try and ruin yet another series via (choose all that apply ) pathetic/ridiculous/eyeroll-worthy/worthless book cover! The problem is, Ms Briggs (view spoiler) [bless her little heart for being such a devoted Kate Daniels fan (hide spoiler) ] is no Ilona Andrews, which means Immutable Law of the Universe #1 (ILotU1\u2122) doesn't apply to her. Yeah, life sucks , I know. Sorry? What? \"What is ILotU1\u2122,\" you ask? Simply this: the crappier the cover, the gloriouser the book. The Andrews recently passed the Blue Abs From Hell Cover Test (BAFHCT\u2122) with flying colors, by the way. And if that isn't the proof that ILotU1\u2122 was created just for them, I don't know what is. Okayyyyy , I seem to vaguely recall that there was originally a point to this paragraph. There must have been something, right? Because everything I say always has a point , right? Right. So glad we blissfully agree, my Little Barnacles. Oh yes, I remember now! The point to this paragraph, I mean! Here it is: <---A>Patricia Briggs</---A> is no Ilona Andrews and this book sucks just as much as its cover ! As you Lovely Decapods very well know, I am quite the special snowflake dedicated masochist . Yes, it is true, I love to read crap stuff I know I will want to kill dead not necessarily enjoy. But what happened here is not my fault . Oh no, absolutely not. Because you see, I loved book 1 in this series SO much, I decided to do the Pre Emptive DNFing Thing (PEDT\u2122) on this one. Which loosely translates to: \"I'd rather die at the hands of a thousand lethally ferocious dinoflagellates than continue with this series.\" More or less. But then Deviously Cunning Angela (DCA\u2122) happened. She put a gun to my lovely little head and made me read this thing book, or else... Horrific thing to do, is it not? Such lowly, disrespectful behavior coming from someone with such despicable book taste wouldn't have been tolerated back in the good old days of my lovely dictatorship. This is pretty disgraceful, if you ask me. I'm telling you, my Tiny Athropods, it is no wonder that this world is going to hell , and that some of you chose to vote for Trumpy instead of electing Craig Schaefer is Slightly Awesome as POTUS #45 *shakes head in desperation* But I ever so slightly digress. So I found myself in the despicable position of having to DNF read this thing book against my better judgement. And here we are. [This is were the supposedly crap-cutting review supposedly begins] Sooooooo , I only read three chapters of this fascinatingly delightful little book because: \u2460 It's boring to death . And it's boring to death. Yeah, that too. 3 chapters = 21% of this book = 61 pages in Briggs world = 1,225,586 pages in the real world. Give or take a few hundred thousand pages. \u2461 The blah blah blah crap is strong in that one . Most of the above mentioned three chapters 1,225,586 pages are filled to the brim with 1/useless dialogues, 2/pointless ramblings and 3/meaningless descriptions of meaningless things. Such a treat. \u2462 The Gloriously Captivating Relationship Crap Extravaganza (GCRCE\u2122), aka the stuff I liked best: \u27bd There are no Love Triangles of Doom and Destruction (LToDaD\u2122) in this world, oh no, that would be way too lame. Ms Briggs has Love Quadrangles of Annihilation and Obliteration (LQoAaO\u2122) instead. It is much, MUCH cooler. \u27bd Mercy Thompson is such a cool, independent young woman that she is very logically defined by her exponentially multiplying suitors . All she does, all she is, seems to be dictated by the dull, boring, flat douchebags delicious males in her life. And that is just SO cool. Go feminism! Go ! \u27bd The LQoAaO\u2122 thing is super exciting . Which is logical. There are, after all, three lacklustre losers hot dudes lusting after Mercy Dear here: one is a doctor (wow) who wants Mercy Dear for her reproductive organs (how positively charming), another is her neighbour who takes her on hot dates with his teenage daughter tagging along (thrilling) and the last one is a vamp with a Mystery Machine \u00e0 la Scooby Doo (how exquisitely modern of him), who likes to play dead sleep in Mercy Dear's bedroom closet once in a while (riveting). What can I say? I'm jealous . I'd gladly give up all the sex slaves cultural attach\u00e9s in my harem if it meant having just one go at one of these cardboard-like idiots luscious babes. Yes, absolutely, this is the truthful truth . These uninteresting fools most edible guys here are that irresistibly irresistible . Is it really? Strange. Have you had your bullshit-o-meter checked like I told you the other day, Spidey dear? I personally smell no BS in a 12,000 mile radius from this review. The End . \u00bb And the moral of this I Have Done the Patricia Briggs Thing FOUR FREAKING TIMES Now even Subaquatic Masochists Have their Limits I am Done Done Done Crappy Non Review (IHDtPBTFFTNeSMHtLIaDDDCNR\u2122) is: Ange is getting a penance read for putting me through two successive pieces of crap slightly unenjoyable books. She will therefore be held at gunpoint shrimp pincers until she turns the last page of The Long Way Down . I have the weird feeling I got somewhat ripped off here, and that she got the better part of the deal. Don't know why . \u270e Book 1 : Moon Called \u2605\u2605 [ Pre-review nonsense ] You Silly Barnacles pretty much all love this series, don't you? Right. That's what I thought. Wait. No . Why the shrimping fish would I deprive the world of my most glorious persona when YOU are the ones who keep reading books wrong?! I shall therefore stay right here and continue to graciously enlighten you Tiny Arthropods of the Despicable Book Taste (TAotDBT\u2122) one crappy read at a time. You are very much welcome. \u25ba\u25ba Not so full My Dear Ms Briggs I Am Sure You Are a Wonderful Person But I am Officially Done Done Done with your Books Yay Go Me Crappy Mini Non Review (MDMBIASYAaWPBIaODDDwyBYGMCMNR\u2122) to come. \u2709 A very private message to my friendly neighbourhood trolls: don't even think about it.

She is able to create a world in which I am completely drawn in, but she writes with such simple elegance. Without a doubt, this is my favorite urban fantasy series so far. Mercy Thompson is the kind of heroine that earns my devotion. She is so brave, but has the same fears and uncertainties that us readers have. She wants a simple life, even though she's a walker, a coyote shapeshifter, who is up to her neck in werewolf politics, not to mention vampire and fae issues. She has to go to work the next day even after staying up all night, dealing with demon-possessed vampires and the like, knowing that some of her close friends might be dead. I think Ms. Briggs has really tapped into the wellspring of what pulls me in as a reader in this genre. She is able to give me a fantastic world that is imbued with the real life things, and the combination is very satisfying. Mercy could not be more admirable. Not a perfect person, but who is? Nevertheless, she has qualities that earn my respect. She is strong, and loving, empathetic, and willing to do the dirty jobs. Her courage in a truly harrowing situation spoke to me. She could have just moved on, and took things as they ended, but her conscience told her she had to finish things. Which she did, despite her fear, her guilt about doing something that went against her code, and her disgust at what she had to to. And Mercy is surrounded by men (wolves/vamps) who are used to exerting their dominance, but she navigates her way through this testosterone-laden world without losing her sense of self, or control over her own life. The men in this series. Oh, the men. <---C>Adam</---C> is the keeper of my heart. I just love that man. I believe he is the right man for Mercy, hands down. The chemistry between Mercy and Adam is divine. There is a naturalness to their relationship, full of tension, but so organic. I loved all their scenes together, reading the subtext of their complex relationship. How Adam has to suppress his compelling power as the alpha, but his feelings for Mercy make it difficult. How Mercy wants to submit, but doesn't want to, at the same time, out of fear of losing herself and disappearing into the pack hierarchy. So intense! And then there's Samuel. He was Mercy's first boyfriend, the man she almost mated to. He still wants her, even more than ever. But he knows he messed up the first time, and his fight to give Mercy the choice of who she wants, takes its toll on him. And then there's his pain at what he has lost, and fears he will never have again. The vampires in this series are scary! They are predators, pure and simple. They have powers that make them formidable enemies and uneasy allies. Mercy's 'so-called' friend Stefan has an ambiguosity to him that is inherent because of his being a powerful vampire, but at the same time, having a humaneness that the other vampires lack. He's one of the good ones, but he's still a predator at the end of the day. Mercy knows she's in over her head when she has to deal with the vampires, and particularly a demon-possessed sorcerer vampire. But Mercy has the power to resist the vampires to a degree that the other preternaturals lack, even though her small size and lack of strength as a coyote shifter leaves her at a disadvantage. There are parts in this book where I felt the tension like a knife edge. The evil that these creatures were capable of was always clear. Yet some hid it behind an urbane facade. But more than anything, I love the wolves. The pack dynamics are utterly fascinating. The basic and primal nature of the wolves always played a factor in how Mercy dealt with Samuel, Adam, Bran (the leader of all the werewolves in North America), Warren (Adam's third, a good friend of Mercy), and some of the other wolves in this book. I felt envy that this was not real. But at the same time, I'm not sure I could handle being in love with a werewolf, and knowing that his control is what keeps him from eating or killing you, if that inner wolf nature takes full control. Not to mention dealing with the dicey pack politics that Mercy gets sucked into, despite her desire to do her own thing. I'm gushing. I know I am. I can't help it. I love this book, and this series. I think I will have restrain myself from speeding my way through it too fast. I don't think I could handle having to wait a long time for the next books in the series, then! If you're looking for a really good urban fantasy series with a heroine that you will fall in love with, I recommend this series. If you are into werewolf fiction, you are really missing out if you don't read this one. These werewolves are the best in fiction (in my opinion). Thumbs way up! ...more The second book in the Mercy installment centers upon the vampires. Stefen, good friend and Scooby-lovin, t-shirt wearing vamp, calls in a favor.

Stefen, good friend and Scooby-lovin, t-shirt wearing vamp, calls in a favor. Favors among the supernatural are always tricky. When Mercy goes with him to a hotel to meet a suspicious new vampire, they both get more than they bargained for. Yucky stuff follows, but Stefen has a different memory of the horror in the hotel. Mercy must share her memory with the vampire seethe in a bloody and creepy way so that the queen Marsilia does not kill Stefen for bringing unwelcome attention to the vampires. From there, Mercy is kicked out of the action while the menfolk look for the crazy vampire, until the queen vampire contacts Mercy and lends her Andre after the men go missing. I'm really not a horror reader. Ever since Pet Sematary when I was thirteen, I've stayed far away from the genre, only coming close when urban fantasy flirted with things that go bump in the night. Oh, and Sherri Tepper, who does the science fiction version of the creepy dark side of humanity. At any rate, this opens with Mercy trapped as a psychotic vampire kills someone in front of her and hardly lets up. Well, I say 'hardly lets up' because I felt like there was a lot of description about eating bloody people as well as general descriptions of blood, torture and killing. But perhaps Briggs needed the horror to keep readers awake, because in between events there is an unbelievable amount of info-dumping. In a side plot, a reporter hounds Mercy, and she ends up giving him a lecture and a half about werewolves, while in the main storyline, Mercy and the reader learn almost everything there is to know about vampire politics, vampire skills, sorcerers and demons. Characterization continues to be one of Briggs' stronger skills with Mercy being the most interesting voice. Plotting has interesting stops along the way, although the overall arc is almost identical to the first book. The editors must not have expected readers to have read book one, as much of chapters one through three review Mercy's identity, her history with Samuel and her recent history with Adam. The crazy vampire bites Mercy, which is an unpleasant bit of rape-foreshadowing. Once again, the book virtually fails the Bechdel test, with the exception of a brief conversation with Honey the werewolf and a grade-school girl who gives her a clue. Even Mercy's talks with an elderly female ghost is about men. It also introduces the idea that Stefen might also have an unusual affection for Mercy, competing with both Adam and Samuel for her attention. Apparently, I was wrong--to know Mercy is to love her. It is also becoming clear that while Mercy may be shuffled to the side by the wolves, she will usually be put into a position where she is 'forced' to circumvent them or to go off on her own. In this case, the crazy vampire was so strong, he \"brought out the wolf\" in everyone. This will become a theme through the series. This one does not hold up as well on re-read, for both personal and critical reasons. It was the book that had me considering giving up on the series, and if I wasn't such a completist, I probably wouldn't even have it on my shelves. Two stars and a half stars, rounding down for both the info-dumping and lukewarm gurrl-power message.

This begins as Mercy\u2019s friend, Stephan the vampire, calls in a favor owed. Little does she know that repayment puts her and the pack in grave danger, not something Stephan intended, either. What they stumble upon is a powerful threat that Mercy can\u2019t let stand and before you know it, she\u2019s waist high in dangerous vampire politics. Trying to distinguish the truth from subterfuge is difficult and vital if Mercy plans on staying alive. Like most UF\u2019s I\u2019ve picked up, Mercy Thompson has a new mystery/problem to overcome with each book and also a continuing story arc that progresses, bit by bit in each installment. The new mystery is the vampire/sorcerer-crazy with massive amounts of power and wicked intent. There were parts of this story that genuinely made heart race from fear! Vampires are scary (and not sparkly), especially in the end! I love Mercedes Thompson! She\u2019s intelligent, a master of reading complicated situations and handling them with care. She reads between the lines and looks beyond the obvious, making her a force to be reckoned with. The continuing arc is the romance, and it\u2019s the part I love best! There is sort of a love triangle with Adam and Samuel in the mix, but not in an irritating way. Samuel has decided to stay in Washington, more specifically, with Mercy, when she\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s not interested. Samuel makes it clear he is. He was her first love but finding out exactly why he was interested her sent her running years ago. Mercy could bear his children, ones that would have the potential to be born werewolves, and therefore Samuel would have children he wouldn\u2019t outlive. Finding out this was more a motivator than love broke Mercy\u2019s heart at sixteen. Now that Mercy looks back, though, she doesn\u2019t regret the situation, because she realizes now that Samuel, as dominant as he is, would\u2019ve wrapped her up in a protective cocoon and stifled her independent spirit. Adam, the Alpha of the pack is domineering but still respects and appreciates Mercy for who she is rather than what she can do. He\u2019s attracted to Mercy the woman, and isn\u2019t looking for a pack brood mare. Mercy knew that Adam claimed her as his mate but thinks this was in name only, just for protection. A lone \u201cwalker\u201d coyote like Mercy without protection would be a target for the wolves and probably wouldn\u2019t last long. A few things happen that make it apparent that Adam\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d has more power and sincerity behind it. This puts Mercy in a bind with Samuel back. Poor Mercy, *not* with two handsome, possessive, alpha males after her! This was an exciting, and sometimes frightening read. Parts at the end gave me chills and goose bumps! I tried to force myself to put it aside just for my commutes. Something I wasn\u2019t at all successful at! I\u2019ve just finished book three: Iron Kissed, and I have to say the series just gets better! I loved Lorelei King as the narrator. She has a warm, rich voice with a slightly sarcastic and humorous tone that I find perfect for Mercy. Her male voices are also quite good, as well, and the story flowed seamlessly because of it. I highly recommend the audio version! You can find this review and more at The Readers Den. ...more I\u2019m beginning to understand why this series has such a large fan base! The first book in this series certainly was promising but I found that a combination of Mercy\u2019s dry tone narrative and a lack of action made it hard for me to get into the story.

Stefan, a vampire who\u2019s been a help and even a friend to Mercy Thompson, calls her at three a.m. to go witness his confrontation with a new vampire in town. But Stefan gives Mercy his word of honor that she won\u2019t be hurt, and asks her to shapeshift into her coyote form to accompany him. The new vampire, Cory Littleton, has a rather mundane name, but his nature is anything commonplace: there is a demon inside of Littleton, and it\u2019s not entirely clear whether the vampire is controlling the demon or is possessed by him. In any case, their meeting turns out to be fraught with danger and death, since Littleton possesses demonic-enhanced sorcerous powers that make him extremely dangerous to everyone in town, including vampires and werewolves as well as humans. As Mercy, Stefan and other vampires and werewolves combine to try to track down and kill or neutralize Littleton, it becomes apparent that there are some characters with a hidden agenda whose goals may not align with Mercy\u2019s and humanity\u2019s best interests. Blood Bound , the second book in the Mercy Thompson series, is a strong urban fantasy and mystery that builds on the world Patricia Briggs created in Moon Called . It\u2019s bursting at the seams with vampires and werewolves, with a few fae characters for additional flavor, as well as Mercy herself, who is a skinwalker and can turn into a coyote at will. Somehow Mercy, a hard-working, down-to-earth automobile mechanic, once again ends up in the middle of serious trouble, as the vampires and werewolves try to sort out the mystery involving Littleton, who\u2019s leaving a trail of bodies behind him with a complete disregard for vampire rules. The one failure for me in Blood Bound is its subplot involving the overused love triangle trope, as Mercy continues to waffle between two werewolves who are each determined to make her their mate. Worse, there are hints that this might be turning into what might be best described as a three-pronged love trident, since now there are actually three different paranormal males interested in Mercy. Vampire society and culture take center stage in Blood Bound , as Mercy visits not only the main vampire compound but some of their personal dwellings, at great risk to herself. Briggs has created a detailed, layered world, with some intriguing twists on vampire characteristics and the standard mythology. The capabilities and shortcomings of Mercy and other supernatural beings, initially simply interesting facts, resurface later in the story and play a role in the development of the plot in a highly satisfying way. The plot and the underlying mystery in Blood Bound are a clear step above that in the first volume, Moon Called . Content advisory: Lots of death and violence, but the gore factor isn't overwhelming. ...more This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life I have so much love for this series!

One thing that I enjoy about re-reading books in series that I love is seeing how many things have changed for the characters. I love how some of the groundwork for future events takes root in earlier books. The characters in this series are wonderful. Mercy is awesome. She has a wonderful sense of humor and she is tough. She knows that she is not as physically strong as many of the people she surrounds herself with but she more than makes up for it in mental toughness. She isn't afraid to take risks especially if it is the right thing to do. This book actually has a pretty big cast of characters and I really love them all. Adam and Sam are both great characters. The members of Adam's pack are all so well defined that they really stand out as individuals. I think it takes real skill to bring such a big group of characters to life. The world building in this series is phenomenal. Everything just fits perfectly. It seems like each book adds another layer to the whole picture with complete consistency. I love all of the pack politics and learning about how all of these different groups have learned to live with each other. There were moments in this book that were quite creepy and I loved every moment of it. I really enjoyed Lorelei King's narration. Her voice fits Mercy's character quiet well. It was really easy to follow and I thought she did a great job differentiating between all of the different characters. I also thought that she did a great job in displaying all of the different emotions of the story. I can't wait to continue this series in audio. I would highly recommend this series to others. I think that anyone who enjoys urban fiction or paranormal stories should check out this series. I am a huge Patricia Briggs fan and can't wait to see what she can come up with next. Initial Thoughts This was a re-read for me. I love this series and I think that I might have liked this book even more the second time around. ...more Okay friends...I'm sorry, but this is it.

The plot, the story idea, the characters are there, but they are constantly smothered by Mercy going on and on about her hormones when she's around either of 2 alpha werewolves. It's about this continually overwhelming the said story and dominating the book. I wanted to like this book as I'm always looking for a good UF but FOR ME..I repeat FOR ME this is just more a PNR (paranormal romance) than it is UF. Mercy comments on how \"hot\" here vampire \"friend\" is even though she's up front about how deadly that can be. Like SO MANY OTHER female protagonists from Stephanie Plum to Dagny Taggart she can't seem to decide on one man. This can be a fatal flaw for a book if you (the reader) detest long constant dialogues, monologues and any other kind of \"logues\" taking up 50%+ of the book. I'm sure the parts of this book that have brought about my dropping the series are the very parts that will keep some reading (I almost named a friend here who I know loves romances paranormal and otherwise...but I don't want to get into trouble). If you like this and it's your cup of tea, enjoy. I'm through, gone, don't plan to follow the series any farther. At least I didn't buy this one. ...more A wonderful series that could use a smidge more romance although I'm enjoying the slow build-up between Mercy and her men.

The only thing is though, has this love-triangle turned into a love-square? Stefan, Mercy's Mystery Machine bus-driving vampire friend, asks her for a favor. She owed him after the events of the last book so she reluctantly agrees. Mercy goes with Stefan to a hotel to meet with a vampire that entered the area without checking in with the queen first. Stefan asks Mercy to accompany him as a coyote in a harness and to act as his pet, she's merely supposed to be part of his costume so he can intimidate the other vampire. Once they get to the hotel though they realize that things aren't as they seem. The hotel is all but empty and Mercy smells something amiss. The creature they meet there isn't just any vampire and Mercy, Stefan, and the rest of her close friends all get thrown into a conflict with a being more evil than they could have imagined. This series's best quality is the characters. They're very well-developed and they feel real; I want to know and I also care about what's going to happen to them. Mercy is likable and down-to-earth; she's the type of girl you'd want to be friends with and have at your back. I'm not sure how I feel about Samuel, but at least he's there to make sure Mercy is safe, even though he really just wants her to have his kids. Adam, though, is delicious. I love how he takes care of his women (Mercy and Jesse) and also manages his pack as a true Alpha. I think he's finally figured out how to deal with Mercy and get through to her without her feeling controlled by him. I hope the next book proves this and their relationship moves forward. I normally like vampire stories better but I have to say this is my favorite werewolf series. I like Briggs's wolves and I think she does one of the best jobs at describing their behavior and making them seem real. On top of the great characterization of the main characters, the side characters do their job of fleshing out the story as well. I normally have a hard time when there's a huge cast but Briggs does a great job of describing them and giving them all a unique personality. And even if she's reintroducing a character we didn't spend a lot of time with she gives a bit of information that jogs the reader's memory. If only all authors would do this! There's been so many series I've gotten frustrated with because I'd forgotten who a character was and I'd sit their with it in the back of my mind trying to figure out who they were and this would kind of ruin the story for me. The villain in this book was actually scary too! I'm not embarrassed to say that I was home alone reading this at night and when I got to a certain part I actually got kind of jumpy. My house is old and makes all kinds of noises and I know this but I kept thinking back to a certain scene in this book and freaking myself out. A great second book and a great story in general. I can't wait to read more about Mercy and her friends! ...more More Stefan and more vampires. Yay! And these are dangerous vampires, not cutesy ones.

Despite the changes, it is fairly easy to keep up with who can do what and why\u2014but the explanations are worked into the book well, not as annoying info dumps. I guess I\u2019m older than the usual target audience for urban fantasy\u2014I\u2019m well beyond the stage of thinking that competing men, vying for my attention, is a wonderful romantic thing. So I\u2019ll be very glad if Mercy chooses one of them in the next book or two and we can get on with sub-plots that are of more interest to me. Fingers crossed. ...more Ugh. I am so unhappy with Ms. Briggs. She created an intelligent, strong, interesting protagonist; a mostly believable world; and engaging supporting characters. Her writing is smooth and keeps you turning the page, wanting to see where the plot is headed. But the sexist drivel just makes me want to puke. On the surface it doesn't seem to be sexist: Mercy abhors the way women are treated in the werewolf pack; she is strong and resourceful and of course has to save the day. But when I delved deep Ugh. I am so unhappy with Ms. Briggs. She created an intelligent, strong, interesting protagonist; a mostly believable world; and engaging supporting characters.

On the surface it doesn't seem to be sexist: Mercy abhors the way women are treated in the werewolf pack; she is strong and resourceful and of course has to save the day. But when I delved deeper, I realized that this is the annoying Heinlein-esque sexism: you know the guy is a jerk and you know better but let's just humor him. The reality is that in humoring, he gets all the power and control. Just because you're going along voluntarily doesn't make it okay. The women in this society are virtually slaves, she freely admits it. The men have magic that can control women and force them to submit, particularly sexually. Mercy knows this and tries to distance herself somewhat but she keeps getting sucked in. She even lives with one of them who wants her. She is constantly in the middle of a tug-of-war with several studs wanting her at once and she doesn't do anything about it. Instead, she continually ends up trying to calm them down by being meek and submissive around them. Don't get me wrong: I believe the society she's created is realistic. It makes perfect sense that people who struggle with a primal beast would succumb to the feral hierarchy directed by testosterone. What I have a problem with is that the character not only tolerates it, she keeps getting herself sucked in. It's the stereotypical bodice-busting romance story of a woman who wants a dangerous man who doesn't treat her well but she knows she can save him. It's disgusting. Why can't these strong women like strong guys who are comfortable in their masculinity and their status in society who treat them well and who respect the woman's own strength and power? I almost stopped reading when I got to a line that went something like, \"You know you submitted because you wanted to.\" The line was referring to a situation where this strong woman was mentally and emotionally controlled through magic and almost forced to have sex against her will (they were interupted which broke the spell) but it was okay because he didn't really have control of his magic because he wanted her so much and secretly she really wanted it? Are you kidding me?! The worst part is this: (This spoiler is about character relationships and not about plot or conflict resolution.) (view spoiler) [ At one point Mercy decides she has to decide between one of these two uncontrolled werewolves that want her: the one that almost raped her and the one that hurt her horribly in the past. She is completely horrified, though, by the vampire who is always gentle and kind to her, never takes her for granted, protects her when necessary but allows her to be strong and powerful, and in general is a perfect gentleman. The reason is that in a crisis he had another vampire kill two half-crazed, near-death minions of a third vampire, minions who would undoubtedly have been killed anyway. It really was a mercy killing, which he did so that Mercy wouldn't be hunted down and slaughtered by the rest of the vampires. She tolerates horrific violence and human rights violations by the werewolves because it's the way they are but she is completely repulsed and terrified of a vampire who will not kill because he knows Mercy doesn't want him to but ends up having to off to near-dead half-vampire/half-humans to save her life? This makes NO sense to me and is a very disturbing set of ethics. I'm not saying she should necessarily be okay with the vampire but her reaction to his wrongs are seriously wonky in relation to her tolerance of the wolves' actions. (hide spoiler) ] I'd give it a one for this sexism alone but I did finish it because it was compelling. And I love that vampire. ...more Blood Bound, the 2nd book in Patricia Briggs Mercy Thompson Series is just as good as the 1st book, Moon Called. Mercy Thompson is a heroine that I absolutely love.

Mercy, my new favourite heroine, finds herself in a bit of a situation involving the seethe and a certain demon-riding vampire named Cory Littleton. The guy ended up with a wuss name, but this creep is scary as fuck! The scene where he was pressed up against Mercy\u2019s bedroom window, scratching the glass with his teeth made me want to go screaming for Sam. But Mercy handles her fear well. She does this countless times within this book, playing detective and using her connections to her advantage. Not only she is capable, but she\u2019s smart as hell too! Briggs knows how to tease me. She loves ending books with the Mercy-Adam-Samuel love triangle. My heart broke when Samuel revealed the truth about what happened when he was in Texas. Aww, the poor guy! And then there\u2019s the fact that he kisses Mercy! TWICE!! And what about that work-out scene with Adam? That scene served two purposes. One, readers get to read about a sweaty Adam. Cue swoons. And two, it furthers the storyline with the dom/sub issue between Mercy and Adam. I don\u2019t see it as a problem since neither of them can control themselves around each other. I have no idea who Mercy is going to choose because I adore both wolves equally! I don\u2019t think Mercy is a girl who\u2019ll leads men on. But if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s got me hooked about this series, it\u2019s the love triangle! I can\u2019t help myself! But this book wasn\u2019t without its imperfections! I thought some scenes dragged on a little too long, such as Mercy\u2019s second visit to Stefan\u2019s menagerie. Nevertheless, this book was damn entertaining and since River-Marked releases tomorrow, I don\u2019t have to wait long to find out what happens!! ...more Buddy read with some friends at Buddies Books and Baubles So I still haven't fully warmed up to this series.

Not a fan of the love triangle tension (and it irks me doubly because I actually like both guys at this point, gods damn it) but otherwise I was fascinated.

Mercy's decision of (view spoiler) [go hunting Andre (hide spoiler) ] was so welcomed, I really needed her to be on her own, making the hard decisions. Stop just letting shit happen to you, girl and take control. I think my problem is I'm still trying to connect with the characters. I can't describe Mercy. She's what? stubborn? brave? fragile? intelligent? She's had a hard past and she knows nothing (doesn't seem to care anyway) about what she is and what she can do. She's excusing the wolves' behavior 30% of this book. \"It wasn't his fault, werewolf instincts are very strong.\" I'm getting tired of that shit. LOVE SQUARE, YOU SAY? (view spoiler) [I love Stefan but really?? (hide spoiler) ] Samuel is up, he's down. One day he's all about possessiveness, next day he's crying? He wants to leave but not before an unforgettable kiss? You know, he could do us all a favor and just go home. Why is he here in the first place? How does it work that the one who used to be the love of your life is living in your trailer, sleeping next to your bedroom and checking on how you smell all the time? You can't even have a private conversation! SHE WON'T HAVE YOUR BABIES, YOU JERK Adam is the most decent option in this mess. He protects Mercy, points for that and his fierce love for Jessie melt my insides. My problem is how they treat Mercy. With werewolves, if a weak male mates with a strong female, she has to tune it down and be submissive because of his mate. Not fair at all. If a dominant male is in front of her, he can use his dominant effect on her and she will feel the need to please him. When Mercy asks Adam about that he excuses himself with the old \"Not my fault! you make me feel this way!\" card. Never read a book about skinwalkers so I can't say much about that but I'd like a more proactive Mercy in the future, I respect her more now and I need to see her as the strong heroine I know she is.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more This second book of Patricia Brigg\u2019s Mercedes Thompson series did not disappoint.

I enjoyed the werewolf and vampire politics. I loved that Mercy was able to manoeuvre herself through the myriad of behaviors so that she would not offend or incite either werewolf or vampire. A few more vampires are introduced, and we learn more about some of the others. Stefan becomes more and more likable with each book. Not only is he totally infatuated with all things Scooby Doo, but he is also a caring master of his human menagerie. Stefan also seems to be very attracted to Mercy. Mercy\u2019s relationship with Adam continues to remain complicated. He has made her his mate in order to protect her. In werewolf politics, a mate holds the same rank, so Mercy is treated with the respect due to an Alpha. Mercy\u2019s roommate Samuel still has feelings for her. It will be interesting to see who Mercy will choose. The villain in this book is so destructive and evil. A combination of vampire and demon, he is very powerful and able to mesmerize vampires. The werewolves take quite the battering from this character. There were several subplots that I did enjoy. I loved it when Mercy would talk to Mrs. Hanna\u2019s ghost. She was a wonderfully quirky character and an interesting addition to the plot. I also liked how Mercy acted as a liaison between Tony from the local police department and the werewolves. I am really enjoying this series and I can\u2019t wait to read the next book. ...more I enjoyed the second book in the series as well. There was one really creepy scene where a scary vampire was trying to get into Mercy's trailer at night while she was alone. There wasn't very much progression with Mercy's feelings toward Adam or Samuel but she does figure out some things. The action scenes were good and the story was fun to read. Okay, so now I am really glad I finally started this series. Blood Bound was just as good as, if not better than, Moon Called . There still wasn't a lot of real action in this book, but there was definitely more of it than in MC. Also, there was a little bit more development in the romance department with BB: Sexy Time with Adam (No, not sex unfortunately. Don't I wish!), Macking with Samuel, and Whispering Sweet Nothings with Stefan. Speaking of, does that mean there's a semi-love square now?

I continued to love all the characters in this continuance of the series. Mercy remains badass. Adam is still sexy as hell. Samuel is still awesome (Even if I did want to punch him for his dick move towards the end-ish). Stefan, well, he drives the Scooby Doo van. Enough said? Jesse is adorable, and I think it's so cute that she and My Young Lover Gabriel are going out. Warren rocks, and I even came to like Ben! I don't think I need go on. The characters in this series rock. One thing I noticed while I was reading Blood Bound --and that I love--is that Mercy always seems to be saving Adam. It's almost as if she is the Knight in Shining Armor and he is the Damsel in Distress. Did anyone else notice this? Yes? No? I think it's hilarious, and quite a change from other typical books where the males always have to rescue the females. So. Another winner from Mercy Thompson and Patricia Briggs. Can't wait to read the next one. Favorite Quote: \"Even with my willpower, his lure was too great,\" I said melodramatically, complete with wrist to forehead. If I made a joke of it, he'd never realize how truthful I was being. A slow smile spread across her face and she quit looking like she was ready to bolt back into the house. \"Dad's kind of a stud, all right.\" \"Jesse,\" warned Adam, his voice muffled only a little by the mat. She giggled. \"I have to agree,\" I said in overly serious tones. \"Maybe as high as a seven or eight, even.\" \"Mercedes,\" Adam thundered, surging to his feet.

Patricia Briggs has solidified herself as another favorite urban fantasy writer of mine with this installment and although she may have made her way into that list rather quickly, I don't regret my quick decision. While Moon Called was solely focused on the werewolves in Mercy's world, Blood Bound revolves around the vampires. For me, what made this novel in particular so spectacular was the chilling plot line. It was creepy, with a healthy dose of legitimate Dracula-esque vampires - a nice change from the sparkly monsters we've been seeing for the past few years. Yet, what really makes this incredible is that although Stefan is a vampire and we are shown the true horror of what it is to be a vampire - something Mercy never realized since Stefan was relatively normal around her - we are still able to recognize Stefan for the monster he is, but appreciate him at the same time. It's a delicate balance, one that involves bringing in a lot of depth to Stefan's character, but it worked perfectly. Nevertheless, while I couldn't stop flipping the pages of this one frantically until the end, I felt a little aloof from Mercy herself in this installment. It was engaging, but the connection I'd established with Mercy in the beginning of Moon Called faded away, which I wasn't a big fan of. I certainly liked this book much better than its predecessor - which unfortunately fell flat for me during the middle and part of the second-half - but I'm hoping for more depth to Mercy with Iron Kissed. If Patricia Briggs keeps writing like this, I suspect I'll be giving her next novel a solid 5 Stars.

The way the females were treated with no respect, no position of their own in the pack was sickening to me, there was no reason for it at all.

The Mercy Thompson Series is UF at its addictive best! Having finished book 1 and instantly downloading this book, Blood Bound (book 2), I've gone on to do it again and am now eagerly devouring book 3 (Iron Kissed)! The fantastic world building of Moon Called continues in Blood Bound as we get an intense look at the vampires in Mercy Thompson's world. It is no surprise then that the owner of the VW bus that Mercy frequently works on, Stephan, is a central character to the suspense plot of this novel. However, there is still plenty of action by all the other magical beings, including walkers (shape shifters), werewolves, fae and even witches to keep you on your toes and enjoying the intricately woven world that only Patricia Briggs' imagination could conjure up! In addition, to the intense suspense, we also get a slight bit of development in the romance department. Adding to the two suitors that featured prominently in Moon Called, Mercy definitively learns that she can add a third one to the count! Moreover, as noted in the first book, not only is the story top-notch but the narration is equally divine! Lorelei King continues to impress me with her talented narration in Blood Bound. Not only does Ms. King maintain remarkable consistency in her voices from the previously introduced characters, but she continues to add even more unique, character appropriate ones in Blood Bound! Ms. King's talented performance no doubt brings this already well-developed listen to an even higher level!

Clever writing, action packed plot, great characters, witty dialogue and subtle romance, Blood Bound has it all. This series is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. In this second instalment Mercy\u2019s vampire friend Stefan asked her for a favour. She is to be a witness in her coyote form while he delivers a message to a fellow vampire. But things turn out to be a dangerous bloodbath as the vampire has a demon possessing his soul. The vampires and the werewolves tell Mercy to stay out of it. But when the ones she cares about are in danger Mercy isn\u2019t the kind of girl to sit on the sidelines and wait. How can you not love Mercy? In this instalment she is the same kick ass character but I think we get to see a little more heart especially in the romance department. Of course the romance is moving along at a snail pace but it works well as they have great chemistry ensuring sparks are flying whenever Mercy is alone with either Adam or Samuel. The love triangle doesn\u2018t bother me like it does in some other books. I think because you can see why Mercy is confused. I so hope Mercy chooses Adam though ~crosses fingers and toes~. Overall, this is a series you shouldn\u2019t miss! ...more 3.5 Stars", "Title": "Blood Bound"},
