Yes, yes, I know all about his weaknesses - the digressions, the rampant footnote abuse, the flaunting of his amazing erudition, the mess that is 'Infinite Jest'. I know all this, and I don't care. Because when he is in top form, there's nobody else I would rather read. The man is hilarious; I think he's a mensch, and I don't believe he parades his erudition just to prove how smart he is. I think he can't help himself - it's a consequence of his wide-ranging curiosity. At heart he's a geek, but a charming, hyper-articulate geek.<---F> Who is almost frighteningly smart</---F>. The pieces in \u201cConsider the Lobster\u201d have appeared previously in Rolling Stone, The Atlantic Monthly, the New York Observer, the Philadelphia Enquirer, Harper\u2019s, Gourmet, and Premiere magazines. Among them are short meditations on Updike\u2019s \u2018Toward the end of Time\u2019, on Dostoyevsky, on Kafka\u2019s humor, and on the \u2018breathtakingly insipid autobiography\u2019 of tennis player Tracy Austin. An intermediate length piece describes Foster Wallace\u2019s (<---B>eminently sane</---B>) reaction to the attacks of September 11th. Each of these shorter essays is interesting, but the meat and potatoes of the book is in the remaining five, considerably longer, pieces. They are: Big Red Son : a report on the 1998 Adult Video News awards (the Oscars of porn) in Las Vegas. Consider the Lobster : a report on a visit to the annual Maine Lobster Festival (for Gourmet magazine). Host : a report on conservative talk radio, based on extensive interviews conducted with John Ziegler, host of \u201cLive and Local\u201d on Southern California\u2019s KFI. Up Simba : an account of seven days on the campaign trail with John McCain in his 2000 presidential bid (for Rolling Stone). Authority and American Usage : a review of Bryan Garner\u2019s \u201cA Dictionary of Modern American Usage\u201d , which serves as a springboard for a terrific exegesis of usage questions and controversies. Here\u2019s what I like about David Foster Wallace\u2019s writing: I know of nobody else who writes as thoughtfully and intelligently. That he manages to write so informatively, with humor and genuine wit, on almost any subject under the sun is mind-blowing \u2013 it\u2019s also why I am willing to forgive his occasional stylistic excesses. (Can you spell \u2018footnote\u2019?) You may not have a strong interest in lobsters or pornography, but the essays in question are terrific. The reporting on Ziegler and McCain is amazingly good, heartbreakingly so, because it makes the relative shallowness of most reporting painfully evident. Finally, the article on usage is a tour de force \u2013 when it first appeared in Harper\u2019s, upon finishing it, I was immediately moved to go online and order a copy of Garner\u2019s book (which is just as good as DFW promised). How can you not enjoy an essay that begins as follows? Did you know that probing the seamy underbelly of US lexicography reveals ideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervor on a near Lewinskian scale? ....... (several other rhetorical questions) ...... Did you know that US lexicography even had a seamy underbelly? And which later contains sentences such as: Teachers who do this are dumb. , This argument is not quite the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological Descriptivism was, but it\u2019s still vulnerable to objections. and \u2013 my personal favorite \u2013 This is so stupid it practically drools. Not everyone will give it 5 stars, but I do. ...more Consider The Essay This is a fine collection of essays. It does not seem to be put together following any particular collective logic, but all the essays seem to be good advertisements to DFW\u2019s intuitively imaginative, explorative and curious writing method. Would need to read more of DFW\u2019s essays to be able to comment on the logic of this particular set of essays inhabiting the same book. It is, however, vintage DFW and hence cannot be rated below 5 stars, even if a couple of essays were so-so. Consider The Essay This is a fine collection of essays.

It is, however, vintage DFW and hence cannot be rated below 5 stars, even if a couple of essays were so-so. Interpolation: For practical purposes, everyone knows what an essay (or a book review) is. As usual, though, there\u2019s much more to know than most of us care about\u2014it\u2019s all a matter of what your interests are. The first extremely explicit essay on an inside look into the Porn industry turned this reviewer off slightly (being the prude that I am) but from then on it was increasingly easy to figure why so many of my most respected friends have such an intellectual crush on DFW. I have too now, I guess. Or maybe it is puppy love. Hard to know for sure. IJ is such a bad place to first encounter DFW, he is all infinite there (with no restrictions on his interpolative imagination), the finite essays are so much more fun, accessible and lovable and most importantly, imitable (at least in intent, if not in style). The biggest crush-inducer, however, is how many of DFW\u2019s sentences and ideas you actually want to remember and use for yourself. Therein lies the most important reason to fall in love - he is really placing himself at a level that you can aspire towards. Not too difficult, not too complex, but deliciously complex enough to stretch comprehension and understanding. It is not terribly difficult to fall in love from there. Interpolation: This reviewer acknowledges that there seems to be some, umm, personal stuff getting worked out here; but the stuff is, umm, germane. As you get into the essays, you will find that the jungle of footnotes and the sub-foot-notes (and sub-sub\u2026 well no point in scaring off potential readers) will soon become a veritable tangle. Not to mention the thicket of interpolations - interpolation upon interpolation upon interpolation, ad infinitum. I had read a New York Times piece with a great quote from DFW in reference to his endnotes: \"Most poetry is written to ride on the breath, and getting to hear the poet read is kind of a revelation and makes the poetry more alive. But with certain literary narrative writers like me, we want the writing to sound like a brain voice, like the sound of the voice inside of the head, and the brain voice is faster, is absent any breath, and it holds together grammatically rather than sonically.\" Interpolation: Not sure if this applies to his fiction as well but, if you happen to miss the footnotes, you would miss half the fun, not to mention half the book. This reviewer was never able to figure out if DFW is showing off or if he just couldn\u2019t help being a genius. It was a source of constant amazement to observe how DFW uses a review (or any given essay) to explore every pet topic imaginable. It was even more amazing to imagine how his editors let him do that. In illustration of this amazement: For it turned out that the more interesting a [\u2026] happenstance was, the more time and page-space it took to make sense of it, or, if it made no sense, to describe what it was and explain why it didn\u2019t make sense but was interesting anyway if viewed in a certain context that then itself had to be described, and so on. With the end result being that the actual document delivered per contract to Rolling Stone magazine turned out to be longer and more complicated than they\u2019d asked for. Quite a bit longer, actually. In fact the article\u2019s editor pointed out that running the whole thing would take up most of Rolling Stone\u2019s text-space and might even cut into the percentage of the magazine reserved for advertisements, which obviously would not do. Surely, you get the drift... Interpolation: On \u2018DFW\u2019 : 'David Foster Wallace' is a pretty long name. David, Foster or Wallace, however, by themselves wouldn\u2019t be enough to indicate who you are referring to. Hence it has to be the whole name - David Foster Wallace, which being too long is \u2018DFW\u2019 - the best option for fans who want to talk about DFW often enough. In sum, give DFW any topic and he will conjure out of it the angst of the modern condition, link it with some fundamental disconnect and manage to be completely non-pretentious and genuine while doing that. He suspends your inner cynic. That is genius, whatever else you might say. ...more What can I say? Another brilliant set of essays. 1. Big Red Son - at the AVN (Adult Video News) Awards.

For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films' worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse\u2014a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake\u2014to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there's a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore's hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. 2. Certainly the End Of Something Or Other, One Would Sort Of Have To Think - book review, John Updike's Toward the End of Time . Here is the upshot, although Wallace is a fan, Toward the End of Time concerns an extremely erudite, successful, narcissistic, and sex-obsessed retired guy who's keeping a one-year journal in which he explores the apocalyptic prospect of his own death.Toward the End of Time is also, of the let's say two dozen Updike books I've read, far and away the worst, a novel so clunky and self-indulgent that it's hard to believe the author let it be published in this kind of shape. 3. Some Remarks on Kafka's Funniness From Which Probably Not Enough Has Been Removed It's not that students don't \"get\" Kafka's humor but that we've taught them to see humor as something you get\u2014the same way we've taught them that a self is something you just have. No wonder they cannot appreciate the really central Kafka joke: that the horrific struggle to establish a human self results in a self whose humanity is inseparable from that horrific struggle. That our endless and impossible journey toward home is in fact our home. It's hard to put into words, up at the blackboard, believe me. You can tell them that maybe it's good they don't \"get\" Kafka. You can ask them to imagine his stories as all about a kind of door. To envision us approaching and pounding on this door, increasingly hard, pounding and pounding, not just wanting admission but needing it; we don't know what it is but we can feel it, this total desperation to enter, pounding and ramming and kicking. That, finally, the door opens \u2026 and it opens outward\u2014we've been inside what we wanted all along. Das ist komisch. 4. Authority and American Usage Love, and do what you will - as applied to grammar. This is a very complicated review of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage by Bryan Garner. Bryan Garner is a genius because he just about completely resolves the Usage Wars' problem of Authority. The book's solution is both semantic and rhetorical. 5. The View From Mrs. Thompson's LOCATION: BLOOMINGTON, ILLINOIS DATES: 11-13 SEPTEMBER 2001 SUBJECT: OBVIOUS What these Bloomington ladies are, or start to seem to me, is innocent. There is what would strike many Americans as a marked, startling lack of cynicism in the room. It does not, for instance, occur to anyone here to remark on how it's maybe a little odd that all three network anchors are in shirtsleeves, or to consider the possibility that Dan Rather's hair's being mussed might not be wholly accidental, or that the constant rerunning of horrific footage might not be just in case some viewers were only now tuning in and hadn't seen it yet. None of the ladies seem to notice the president's odd little lightless eyes appear to get closer and closer together throughout his taped address, nor that some of his lines sound almost plagiaristically identical to those uttered by Bruce Willis (as a right-wing wacko, recall) in The Siege a couple years back. Nor that at least some of the sheer weirdness of watching the Horror unfold has been how closely various shots and scenes have mirrored the plots of everything from Die Hard I-III to Air Force One. Nobody's near hip enough to lodge the sick and obvious po-mo complaint: We've Seen This Before. Instead, what they do is all sit together and feel really bad, and pray. No one in Mrs. Thompson's crew would ever be so nauseous as to try to get everybody to pray aloud or form a prayer circle, but you can still tell what they're all doing. 6. How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart A review of the Tracy Austin autobiography, Beyond Center Court: My Story . The book is bad, but hey, ...maybe we automatically expect people who are geniuses as athletes to be geniuses also as speakers and writers, to be articulate, perceptive, truthful, profound. If it's just that we naively expect geniuses-in-motion to be also geniuses-in-reflection, then their failure to be that shouldn't really seem any crueler or more disillusioning than Kant's glass jaw or Eliot's inability to hit the curve. 7. Up, Simba With John McCain on his campaign bus in 2000. He gives a mini biography of McCain's experience as a POW with gruesome detail, and his refusal to be released without the other POWs, This gives him the moral authority both to utter lines about causes beyond self-interest and to expect us, even in this age of spin and lawyerly cunning, to believe he means them. And yes, literally: \"moral authority,\" that old clich\u00e9, like so many other clich\u00e9s\u2014\"service,\" \"honor,\" \"duty\"\u2014that have become now just mostly words, slogans invoked by men in nice suits who want something from us. 8. Consider the Lobster Wallace covers the Maine Lobster Festival, 2003. Is it all right to boil a sentient creature alive just for our gustatory pleasure? Lobsters don't have much in the way of eyesight or hearing, but they do have an exquisite tactile sense, one facilitated by hundreds of thousands of tiny hairs that protrude through their carapace. \"Thus it is,\" in the words of T. M. Prudden's industry classic About Lobster, \"that although encased in what seems a solid, impenetrable armor, the lobster can receive stimuli and impressions from without as readily as if it possessed a soft and delicate skin.\" And lobsters do have nociceptors, as well as invertebrate versions of the prostaglandins and major neurotransmitters via which our own brains register pain. 9. Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky - A review of Joseph Frank's five-volume Dostoevsky . The thing about Dostoevsky's characters is that they are alive. By which I don't just mean that they're successfully realized or developed or \"rounded.\" The best of them live inside us, forever, once we've met them. Recall the proud and pathetic Raskolnikov, the naive Devushkin, the beautiful and damned Nastasya of The Idiot, the fawning Lebyedev and spiderish Ippolit of the same novel; C&P's ingenious maverick detective Porfiry Petrovich (without whom there would probably be no commercial crime fiction w/ eccentrically brilliant cops); Marmeladov, the hideous and pitiful sot; or the vain and noble roulette addict Aleksey Ivanovich of The Gambler; the gold-hearted prostitutes Sonya and Liza; the cynically innocent Aglaia; or the unbelievably repellent Smerdyakov, that living engine of slimy resentment in whom I personally see parts of myself I can barely stand to look at; or the idealized and all-too-human Myshkin and Alyosha, the doomed human Christ and triumphant child-pilgrim, respectively. These and so many other FMD creatures are alive\u2014retain what Frank calls their \"immense vitality\"\u2014not because they're just skillfully drawn types or facets of human beings but because, acting within plausible and morally compelling plots, they dramatize the profoundest parts of all humans, the parts most conflicted, most serious\u2014the ones with the most at stake. Plus, without ever ceasing to be 3-D individuals, Dostoevsky's characters manage to embody whole ideologies and philosophies of life: Raskolnikov the rational egoism of the 1860s' intelligentsia, Myshkin mystical Christian love, the Underground Man the influence of European positivism on the Russian character, Ippolit the individual will raging against death's inevitability, Aleksey the perversion of Slavophilic pride in the face of European decadence, and so on and so forth.... The thrust here is that Dostoevsky wrote fiction about the stuff that's really important. He wrote fiction about identity, moral value, death, will, sexual vs. spiritual love, greed, freedom, obsession, reason, faith, suicide. And he did it without ever reducing his characters to mouthpieces or his books to tracts. His concern was always what it is to be a human being\u2014that is, how to be an actual person, someone whose life is informed by values and principles, instead of just an especially shrewd kind of self-preserving animal. 10. Host - Read it here: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/a... An article on John Ziegler and talk radio. Whatever the social effects of talk radio or the partisan agendas of certain hosts, it is a fallacy that political talk radio is motivated by ideology. It is not. Political talk radio is a business, and it is motivated by revenue. The conservatism that dominates today's AM airwaves does so because it generates high Arbitron ratings, high ad rates, and maximum profits.

This is my first foray into the works of DFW. It's unclear at this time if I'll read this in one sitting or at random, notwithstanding, my intent is to review each essay as a standalone. Big Red Son Big Red Son is the first of nine essays. What possible contrasts can be drawn between auto-castration, the Hollywood film industry with it's less celebrated but more lucrative twin, the US adult film industry? A hilarious, insightful, birds-eye reporting, documenting the vagaries of porn, and those who live in it. It's the story no doubt but more than this, it's the raconteur. Wallace is a master word and world-builder, creating vivid pictures, showing the reader, seemingly and without thought, the world far removed from everyday life while, conversely, presenting society's addiction (if the sales numbers are to be believed) to porn. At the end of Big Red Son, it becomes apparent why some men might consider (and have inflicted) auto-castration. Should I even mention the genius of this author? A self-named snoot, whose lexicon conveys an intrinsic brilliance that will have you calling your parents and gifting them a refund of all tuition fees they'd ever paid? Because, clearly, you must have attended one too many frat parties. Ahhh. But, I console myself with the knowledge that I am not alone in feeling as such. TBC ...more Outstanding.

ZZZZZZZZ) At first the format of the essay \"Host\" irritated me, but soon enough I was over that and into more DFW brilliance. While I enjoyed the SNOOT essay (Authority and American Useage) as well, I think it soured me because he made me feel stoopid. Most things on the title page (LADY's ROOM, Bald-faced) I understood, laughed at, and even scoffed at, but some of it was over my head. (the use of fewer vs. less, for example. Hey, I did not major in English. And to my defense, I know the difference between there and their, your and you're. so neener neener!) (I'M SO SORRY, DFW!!!!!!) Out of all these essays, I LOVED \"Big Red Son\" and \"Consider the Lobster\". Hands down, the best in the book. Some of my favorite parts from Big Red Son: \"...has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.\" \"Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline.\" When a porn star writes a note with a pen in her anus, DFW states it was \"...thereon written in a hand (28) that seems impressively legible, considering.\" 28 - so to speak.

H There's a small theme running through some of these essays(1): People trying to bridge the gap between two different camps. In \"Authority and American Usage\" DFW praises Garner for bridging the gap between the Prescriptionist and the Descriptionist usage experts. In \"Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky\" Frank impresses DFW by weaving together two rival approaches to literary criticism. \"Up, Simba\" is an encomium to John McCain's ability to appeal to Young Voters (presumably of all political stripes(2).) Herein lies the major weakness of the book. This desire to reconcile two different camps, to me, comes across as a little wishy-washy. Compare \"Up, Simba\" with Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 , one of my favorite books about a political campaign. Thompson really impressed me with his uninhibited, unvarnished attack on mealy-mouthed candidates who try to appeal to the center at the expense of \"the hippie and freak vote,\" a bloc of voters which Thompson clearly embraces. The book is full of passion and vitality, which I felt a little lacking in DFW's(3) book. Of course, I realize that there is more than one discussion group here on GR dedicated to DFW and he is not without his very devout defenders, so let me just say while I did not enjoy this book as much as others, I recognize he has his merits and respect those who got more out of this book than I did(4). (1) I question calling them essays. Most of them are journalism pieces, and in fact DFW excels most in reportage. He has an amzing talent for finding and describing the telling detail. It's the more analytical \"essay*\" parts of the pieces that let me down. * Essay in the sense that Montaigne used the word--a \"trial\" of one's own opinion. (2) Partisanship, at least, is not emphasized when he discusses YV. (3) Armchair Psychoanalyzing On My Part: Considering how DFW ended his life, I couldn't help thinking that perhaps this lack was in part a symptom of depression. It's also entirely possible that the fact that my knowledge of DFW's suicide, in some way, colored my reading of this book. (4) In \"Authority and American Usage\" DFW espouses what he calls \"the Democratic Spirit,\" which he defines as a rigorous defense of one's own opinion combined with a humble respect for another person's views. While an admirable outlook in the real world, in a book of essays this too struck me as a bit of a hedge and a lack of desire to man the bastions and put up a fight. Depressed people often seek to avoid conflict. ...more I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said.

(If I remember correctly, I said something similar about Pynchon in Against the Day , and perhaps this means I've hit upon something which is, for me, one of the reasons that these somewhat pedantic writers who are doubtlessly some of the greatest ever literary minds rarely come across to me as condescending or patronizing or impenetrable: beauty .) I think I had intended some time ago when I finished this to go through essay by essay and say clever things about them, but it's been a long time and I'm always too buys to dally with books I've already finished. Besides, I nursed this one for a few months, parceling out one essay every few weeks so as not to overdose on his thrillingness. I will say that the grammar essay was one of the most mind-blowingly, awe-inspiringly nerdy things I've ever come across, and I loved every single clause and punctuation mark of it. ...more BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE Nel 1966 i Doors debuttarono con il disco omonimo.

Fu una rivoluzione, altro che Oblad\u00ec Oblad\u00e0. Tuttora, il disco \u00e8 fantastico, attualissimo e per tanti versi, ancora anticipatore. DFW mi ci ha fatto pensare. Penso che DFW sia stato nella letteratura come Morrison nella musica (moderna? Contemporanea? Rock? Pop? Per me, musica tout court), e le sue opere siano arrivate come arriv\u00f2 il primo disco dei Doors: met\u00e0 meteora met\u00e0 bomba. Un incontro ravvicinato del terzo tipo, che \u00e8 diventato amicizia. Quando lo leggo, mi sento come in cima a un faro, e chi mi frequenta sa che ho la passione per questo luogo e architettura e simbolo: con un libro di DFW in mano sono in un posto che svetta su tutto senza ostacoli aperto a 360\u00b0. DFW apre una finestra alla volta, con ogni narrazione (saggio, racconto, romanzo, son tutte narrazioni), allarga l'orizzonte, attraverso il suo punto di vista si riesce a vedere la terra che finisce e l\u00e0 comincia il cielo (per esempio, la sua visuale sull'11 settembre 2001). Altro aspetto molto interessante delle opere del nostro affezionato \u00e8 che l'argomento che affronta non ha la minima importanza: cosa pu\u00f2 interessarci del resoconto di una crociera nei Caraibi, o dell'analisi critica dell'autobiografia di Tracy Austin, per non parlare della minuziosa disanima di un nuovo dizionario della lingua inglese?! Meno di niente ovviamente. Errore. O meglio, errore parziale: all'inizio non ce ne importa nulla ed \u00e8 giusto - poi man mano che DFW parola dopo parola, rigo dopo rigo, nota dopo nota e pagina dopo pagina, ci assorbe cattura trasforma ammalia, di quegli argomenti l\u00ec ci interessa moltissimo e vogliamo che continui a parlarcene. Oppure, ci interessa semplicemente che ci parli, che si rivolga a noi, perch\u00e9 quello che conta \u00e8 la sua voce pi\u00f9 che le cose che dice. Anche perch\u00e9 il fatto che scrivendo si rivolga spesso direttamente a noi lettori, davvero a noi come fossimo persone, adulti intelligenti e degni di rispetto (e non all'astrazione demografica che potremmo rappresentare, e qui uso e gioco con le sue stesse parole) non \u00e8 un vezzo, \u00e8 proprio vero: DFW scrive per noi. Per lui noi siamo fondamentali, non si prende mai sul serio ma prende noi dannatamente sul serio. Forse se continua a parlarci, a interessarsi a noi, prima o poi ci illumina del suo immenso, ci rende un po' pi\u00f9 intelligenti colti ossessivi maniacali ironici divertenti brillanti... Mi piace il suo coraggio, il suo non nascondersi, non tirarsi indietro, il suo mettersi in gioco e in discussione, il suo spaccare il capello in 44, il suo trasformare sabbia in oro... Un'altra cosa che mi ha colpito \u00e8 che con DFW ho messo da parte la matita: o sottolineavo e chiosavo tutto, o nulla, come ho subito capito che era meglio fare.

His observations are full of extra bits of information, presented in a surfeit of footnotes. In fact, there may be more footnote than text. But again, that's okay, because they are almost always interesting. Okay, not always, and yes, he goes overboard sometimes in trying to be clever with them, especially in his essay \"Host\" about a talk radio host in Los Angeles. On the other hand, his insights into what drives talk radio (not politics, but ratings) make up for any excess in presentation.

Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma).\" Aside from hinting at the hilarious absurdity with which Wallace analyzes everything from porn galas to lobster festivals to John McCain's Straight Talk Express, this passage nicely captures my emotional approach to this book: I'd heard this Wallace guy had a pretty big brain. Now I know he had a pretty big brain. Way bigger than mine. We'll see if the disparity affects my ability to, uh, write. So he was smart. Every essay had something new for me, like how dictionaries are, unlike phone books, ideological and rhetorical in nature and therefore worthy of criticism, or how modern American novelists are embarrassed by articulating morals, and how that's a problem. Like I said, he was also funny. Aggravate-your-fellow-airplane-prisoner/patrons-with-constant-laughter funny. On top of all this, he seemed genuine, which is both forehead-smackingly sensible *and* impressive given his repeated inquiries into authenticity. Reading around I guess Wallace was well-known for being anti-ironic, but the effect on this reader was essentially the same quality Wallace himself lauds in the cornerstone piece in this collection, \"Authority and American Usage\": Wallace is ever-present in his own writing, and he earns his authority with wit, compassion, and some endearing absurdities (borrowing a leather jacket to be cool enough to report for Rolling Stone being my fave). I liked his way of analyzing a subject by hanging out with people of tertiary significance. He didn't talk to John McCain, or John McCain's advisors. He hung out with the camera crews. Same with the porn awards: he spends most of his time talking to professional porn journalists (apparently that's a thing). Maybe this was his way of avoiding BS, like he didn't believe there was any hope of deriving genuine meaning about a person by actually speaking with them directly, but meaning could be triangulated through the perceptions of technicians and professionals who were not directly responsible for considering semantics (but did so all the same). In the case of John McCain that's a bit odd since the whole piece concerns the question of whether McCain actually means what he says, unlike every other politician in history. Anyway, the more I try to think about the book the more the aforementioned metaphorical anuresis is kicking in. The book was unexpectedly magnetic, intellectually consuming, and totally compelling from start to finish. If you can stomach footnotes that have their own footnotes that are themselves then referenced in the main text, suggesting they were not actually that ancillary after all, then you should probably pick this up. Words Oh man, so many great words. satyriasis (n): uncontrollable sexual obsession in men. (p. 53) lallate (v): conventionally to replace your r's with l's, or to speak in a nonsensical baby fashion, but in the sense DFW intended here I guess it means calming, as in a lullaby, as described here . (p. 64) sprachgefuhl (n): sensitivity to linguistic propriety (p. 69) dysphemism (n): inserting an intentionally harsh word or phrase when a more neutral one would suffice, opposite of euphemism. Apparently never having encountered this word makes me NOT a SNOOT. (p. 70) solecism (n): linguistic goof, incorrect use of language. (p. 71 and everywhere in this essay) pertussion (n): coughing, though most dictionaries seem to list the word as \"pertussis.\" (p. 71) styptic (adj): confining or binding in this case, but also used to describe substances that stanch bleeding. I almost wrote \"staunch.\" If there's one word I'm going to remember from this book it's \"solecism.\" (p. 80) spiriferous (adj): having spires. I hate words like this. (p. 42) anapest (n): two short syllables followed by one long, in this case \"where's it at.\" Is \"anapest\" itself an anapest? (p. 99) trochee (n): long syllable followed by a short one. Why a \"monosyllabic foot + trochee\" is supposed to be uglier than a \"strong anapest\" is beyond me. (p. 99) pleonasm (n): excessive use of words to express something, in this cases leveled as a criticism against academic writing, which is somewhat absurd coming from DFW who is pleonastic in the extreme.

Use that book as your frame of reference for style and content and you can place this collection firmly into the category of \"typical\" DFW. That being said, if you thoroughly enjoyed A Supposedly Fun Thing... then you'll likely thoroughly enjoy this one as well; by that same coin, if you're on the fence I would suggest, dear reader, that when considering Consider the Lobster , that you consider it in the same light as David Foster Wallace 's collection A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again . Use that book as your frame of reference for style and content and you can place this collection firmly into the category of \"typical\" DFW. That being said, if you thoroughly enjoyed A Supposedly Fun Thing... then you'll likely thoroughly enjoy this one as well; by that same coin, if you're on the fence, you're unlikely to be won over; and if you dislike DFW\u2020 then this collection will probably do you no favors. So in this reviewer's opinion: Consider the Lobster is more of the same. But that's a good thing. One thing that CtL has over ASFTINDA is that it reads like an essayist's equivalent to a DJ's mixtape. While the essays individually are more than capable of standing on their own (e.g., apart from each other; i.e., in their original printings) they are arranged in such a creative way here that they build upon each other. The essays are vaguely self-referential, perhaps purposefully so; \"jokes\" from a given essay may rely heavily on you properly \"getting\" and then retaining the thesis of a preceding essay. I submit as an example: \"Authority and American Usage\" contains several sections that are slightly humorous in their own respect but can only be truly appreciated as bracingly so when you recall Wallace's thesis on Franz Kafka's humor from the prior article and the accompanying explication of said humor and why it is thoroughly pointless to try and explain any joke anywhere, let alone Kafka's absurdly dark and probably pathological comedy\u2020\u2020. In this way, CtL may be Wallace's finest collection to date; the interleaving of the essays, their strength when taken as a whole, an obscurely surreal recursion. It's really all quite expertly done. Perhaps the highlight of this collection is the maturity that Wallace is showing. Previous collections have his tone and style coming off as a bit of an effete intellectual, a nerdy-but-hip smartest-kid-in-class tone that is simultaneously masterfully humorous and maddening. Like maybe he's just trying to make you feel dumb but then again maybe it's thesaurial sleight-of-hand to play into some particular joke. Which is not at all to suggest that he has discarded this completely. But maybe like he's toned it down a bit\u2020\u2020\u2020? His signature style is definitely still there but he seems to have grown into it, it's a better fit. Whereas before it may have felt borderline confrontational (see above), it comes across now as disarming. For example, in the midst of \"Authority and American Usage\", Wallace comes across (on the one hand) vaguely condescending of SNOOTs\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 and then on the other hand admits to being one; and then he takes a deeper dig on SNOOTs by eviscerating their essays and articles and other writings (e.g., the heavy-handed and jargon-laden \"worst ever\" publications of Comparative Lit profs) by using the very same over-the-top vocabulary to get to that point\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020. The whole routine can be a little jaw-clenched maddening but is for those same reasons endearing and worthwhile. It is also seems worth mentioning that Wallace masterfully frames pretty grand subject matter in all kinds of tangential and frankly genius-like-a-mad-scientist ways that it's formidable and a bit frightening. Example: Wallace uses \"Authority and American Usage\" as a vehicle to discuss linguistic politics and the critical role of socialization, language learning, and regional dialects on individual growth and development\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020. Example: Wallace uses his coverage of McCain2000 in \"Up, Simba!\" to discuss the political brokerage through media outlets and the bizarre power dynamics at work between journalists, politicians, and their handlers\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020. Example: how Wallace goes to work on the ethics of food in \"Consider the Lobster\", working through the logic rather elegantly and then stupefyingly relinquishing it all with the atavistic admission that that simply isn't enough to tear you away from the desire to enjoy something delicious. In light of all this, it's no wonder an aspiring author Such As continues to find himself enthralled and intimidated by this literary Cronus. Parting shots? I have two: the first regarding my \"four of five\" rating and the second a mere sidebar. First: though the tone in CtL shows a refreshing maturity and welcome evolution, and though every essay is engaging and timely and brilliant, there also seem to be moments of tedium. Perhaps this is expected and unavoidable. But an essay on a book on the life and times of Dostoevsky (e.g.) can disappoint. Abandoning the F.N. format for a House of Leaves -esque series of drawn boxes is more distracting than textually informing (even if the essay's content is exhilarating and terrifying). And maybe it's just me but \"How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart\" seemed (via the text) a parody of itself as much as it was a parody and/or review of the book in question. Second: while I don't believe that these kinds of things, should matter, I'm also of the opinion that Wallace should have fired the photographer. Or perhaps chosen a better photo from that particular shoot. I realize that folks may want their book jacket photos to be relatively current, and I realize that our bodies change over time, and all of that is fine; but I also wonder if his publisher could have perhaps insisted that they find a photo that did NOT make him look like a squinty-eyed and slightly slumped Jeffrey Lebowski. Seriously sir, that's your credibility at stake here. ------ \u2020 = If you truly and I mean honestly and passionately dislike DFW, well then I suggest some rigorous therapeutic interventions. \u2020\u2020 = Which is totally drained of its humor when you try to offer any kind of explanation. I offer as further evidence for this that (after a protracted bout of laughing) I read aloud (to A.) a passage from \"Authority and American Usage\" and how it's humor is underscored by the thesis of the Kafka essay to which A. offered scarcely an acknowledging chortle. \u2020\u2020\u2020 = Maybe? \u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 = Just read the essay. \u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 = I mean seriously: do you know anyone to drop \"solecistic\" in casual conversation? \u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 = Compare/contrast with similar arguments posited in Freakonomics . \u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 = Let it also be known that this becomes painfully apparent when the essay's title appears in the text.

In \"Big Red Son\", an essay about the Annual AVN Awards (that's Adult Video News , by the way) I learned more about the adult entertainment industry than I ever thought possible. In addition to covering the event, DFW covered so many other aspects of the industry that it's almost overwhelming, and almost every page of the essay is accompanied by copious footnotes. Anything you've ever wanted to know but were afraid to ask? PM me. He brought the same level of detail to an article about John McCain that was originally written for Rolling Stone Magazine , but is presented in the book in its unabridged form. Following him on the 2000 campaign trail (before he was knocked out of the race by Bush) I was presented with so much interesting information on John McCain that I have to admit that I have more respect for him now. I'm not voting for him, but I can respect him, and that's mainly because DFW objectively presented him to me in a way that I haven't really seen in other media coverage. Don't get me wrong - he doesn't let him off the hook for anything - but his exhaustive coverage and his further analysis of his own coverage made for some really interesting reading in light of the current presidential campaigns. \"Consider the Lobster\" is simply hilarious when you think about the fact that he wrote it for Gourmet Magazine , and pretty much calls readers' attention to the plight of the lobster as it's cooked alive. He was sent to cover a lobster festival in Maine, and I hope that the editor of the article knew what he was getting himself into when he hired DFW to cover it, or he might have been pretty surprised when the copy arrived. I'm sure it's not the angle most writers would've explored for a magazine whose readers enjoy eating gourmet foods. Like lobsters. And who probably don't want to think about them screaming in the pot.* I could go on and on about the essays, but what struck me most was his exhaustive knowledge of their subjects. This was a man who left no stone unturned. I'm amazed by how his mind must have worked to capture, compile and translate everything he learned and experienced into his work. His death - what a loss to the literary world. And the world, period. *That's a myth by the way - it's just steam escaping from the space between the lobster's flesh and it's shell.

In the course of reading these, I've had the pleasure of pondering what it is I get wrong about Kafka and Dostoevsky, the plight of the (post)modern politician, the rise of conservative radio, and why grammar matters (and I mean REALLY MATTERS). Wallace's real talent is in explicating a point, then noting some of the inconsistencies, ironies, and contradictions inherent in that point, and finally articulating why those ironies and contradictions exist and why they matter or don't matter. Remember Shrek? Ogres are like onions because they have layers? Only Wallace's ogre is our current reality and it's one tough onion! That said, there is one clunker in the bunch. The 9/11 essay 'The View From Mrs. Thompson's', which feels contrived, manipulative, and falls well short of what I would guess Wallace intended. Granted, this is a tough subject to approach for any writer and direct emotional appeal has never been Wallace's strength, so it should come as no surprise to us that it falls flat. What would have been a lovely essay, perhaps, would be Wallace's explication of the difficulties of writing about 9/11. ...more Credo di aver goduto poche volte nella mia vita come durante la lettura di Considera l'aragosta, e mai leggendo una raccolta di saggi.

Although the best part of not his best was that he seemed really human. Sometimes sneering or judgmental, just like you and me. One of DFW\u2019s idols, Gaddis, was reluctant to interview because he believed his best work was in his novels, and it makes perfect sense that a good novel can be left alone without explanation from the artist. Yet as DFW expands upon his work in interviews, he has clearly managed to observe and articulate effectively the problems with the modern condition, yet, and as I suspect with most artists, some of his writing style here suggests to me that he hasn\u2019t managed to escape the issues himself. DFW is treated as some sort of prophet, and I for one was jealous of how he seemed to know how to live. Knowing how to live and living it are two different things entirely, and I have now realised that if someone is capable of imparting real and effective advice, it may well be because they are unable to take it themselves. I really love the epiphany that we\u2019re all human- I would love to have it more often.

That the clerestorical phallocracy of language usage [3] and the postmodern pseudo-anxiety of yr. writer will not let a single sentence be de facto luxated?

Gli argomenti dei singoli saggi sono piuttosto eterogenei, in omaggio alla pretesa, per quanto molto ben dissimulata, expertise di tuttologo di DFW, vero e proprio guru della cultura pop e del postmodernismo. Per quanto non riesca ad apprezzarlo, una cosa gli va riconosciuta: il coraggio di immergersi completamente nell\u2019ambiente di cui intende scrivere, per darne una visione quanto pi\u00f9 possibile dettagliata, direi quasi embedded (in senso positivo). DFW non parla mai per sentito dire: il suo racconto \u00e8 quello di un testimone diretto, appassionato per interesse e nel contempo imparziale, visto che nulla intende risparmiarci di quello che pu\u00f2 vedere. Ma proprio a causa dell\u2019assenza di filtri, nel rendere la sua testimonianza finisce per perdersi in mille dettagli scarsamente utili e in considerazioni terribilmente scontate e banali, ingenerando noia, disappunto e in qualche caso vero e proprio fastidio nel lettore che non sia sintonizzato sulla sua lunghezza d\u2019onda. Prendiamo il primo saggio, Il figlio grosso e rosso , dedicato al mondo della pornografia made in USA nei giorni della premiazione degli Avn Awards, gli Oscar del cinema a luci rosse: in 50 pagine \u201ci vostri corrispondenti\u201d (perch\u00e9 il plurale majestatis ?) raccontano nei particolari la pacchianeria, la volgarit\u00e0, la banalit\u00e0 del mondo del porno, mostrando come tutti i luoghi comuni immaginabili su chi produce, gira e interpreta film a luci rosse siano desolatamente veri. Descrizioni e interviste sono punteggiate da pillole di moralismo, talvolta in chiave pseudofemminista, con un'unica intelligente riflessione (in una nota a pg. 30) sul progressivo spostamento dei confini del porno a seguito dello sdoganamento della volgarit\u00e0 nei mass media. Oppure consideriamo il macrosaggio (circa 100 pagine!) scritto in forma di diario di bordo al seguito dello staff della campagna elettorale del senatore repubblicano John McCain nell\u2019anno 2000: di gran lunga il pezzo pi\u00f9 noioso dell\u2019intero libro! La descrizione dei bizzarri meccanismi della campagna elettorale e dei partecipanti \u2013 politici, giornalisti, tecnici e supporter \u2013 non riesce mai ad avvincere il lettore, che si stanca ben presto del complicato gergo e dei tecnicismi usati ad abundantiam (al punto che serve un glossario di 4 pagine per chiarire di cosa si sta parlando). Parimenti soporifere le numerosissime considerazioni sull\u2019attrezzatura tecnologica che sfiorano il product placement . Si salva un poco la parte finale che narra l'intervento spiazzante di una signora conservatrice che ha il pregio di movimentare un po' la campagna di McCain, anche se DFW esprime dubbi sull'autenticit\u00e0 dell'episodio. Pi\u00f9 godibile il saggio che d\u00e0 il nome alla raccolta, anche per il ridotto uso di note e incisi. Prendendo spunto dal Festival dell\u2019Aragosta in Maine che si tiene annualmente fra luglio e agosto, il nostro propone una serie di considerazioni interessanti sulla liceit\u00e0 del mangiare carne animale, sul tema della sofferenza degli animali e sulle procedure disponibili per evitare tale sofferenza. Alla fine DFW riconosce onestamente che su certe questioni inerenti l\u2019etica e l\u2019estetica \u00e8 davvero difficile dare risposte, anche non definitive. Per la sua brevit\u00e0 e per l'onest\u00e0 del racconto, mi \u00e8 piaciuto il pezzo dedicato all'11 settembre. Forse il tema dell'orrore indicibile ha frenato la vena ironica del nostro e lo ha costretto a riflessioni pi\u00f9 contenute, meno \"brillanti\" e pi\u00f9 interessanti, sulla percezione di quei terribili eventi da parte della popolazione piccolo-borghese del MidWest, che nonostante l\u2019esposizione ossessiva della bandiera USA sembra spiritualmente lontana da New York quanto possiamo esserlo noi italiani, e forse anche di pi\u00f9. Anche sui saggi dedicati a lingua e letteratura prevale il giudizio negativo. La recensione della biografia dell\u2019ex-tennista e bambina prodigio Tracy Austin mi ha lasciato piuttosto perplesso. La banalit\u00e0 della tesi (i campioni dello sport non sono capaci di scrivere un\u2019autobiografia interessante e i fan ne rimangono delusi) \u00e8 sconcertante... viene quasi il dubbio che DFW, noto appassionato di tennis, volesse scriverla lui: poteva provarci, se non altro! Il brevissimo pezzo sulla comicit\u00e0 di Kafka ha un titolo quasi pi\u00f9 lungo del saggio stesso (\"Alcune considerazioni sulla comicit\u00e0 di Kafka che forse dovevano essere tagliate ulteriormente\"), ma si riduce alla banale constatazione che gli studenti USA non riescono a comprendere la comicit\u00e0 kafkiana perch\u00e9 non assomiglia a quella delle barzellette ( sic ). Per altro capisco e condivido la lamentazione dell\u2019insegnante di letteratura DFW per l\u2019incapacit\u00e0 degli studenti di comprendere un gigante come Kafka. Mi stupisce di pi\u00f9 la bizzarra critica rivolta a Dostoevskij (in un altro saggio) di essere uno scrittore datato, \u201cartificioso\u201d e di costruire scene e personaggi poco credibili perch\u00e9 troppo diversi dalla nostra contemporaneit\u00e0 (pg. 292, sorvolo sugli appunti ingenui sull\u2019uso del patronimico e sulla complicata gerarchia sociale russa). Per quanto discontinua, la recensione della monumentale biografia di D. scritta da Joseph Franck, di cui DFW d\u00e0 un giudizio molto positivo, \u00e8 comunque uno dei saggi pi\u00f9 leggibili e gradevoli del libro, in virt\u00f9 della ridotta tendenza alla divagazione fine a se stessa, se si escludono i piccoli brani esistenziali inframmezzati nel testo e delimitati da asterischi, che non esito a definire del tutto gratuiti. Non condivido per\u00f2 la convinzione di DFW che oggi non disponiamo pi\u00f9 di Autori potenti e ideologici come D., e che la letteratura del XXI secolo sia del tutto svirilizzata, estetizzante e ossessionata dal politically correct . Certo un Dostoevskij \u00e8 davvero difficile da trovare, ma come si possono ignorare Jos\u00e9 Saramago, G\u00fcnter Grass o Philip Roth? Ah, gi\u00e0, dimenticavo, Philip Roth \u00e8 il totem del parricida DFW, che nei panni del giovane autore deve rinnegare i suoi padri per farsi strada. Lo dimostra il secondo breve saggio, una pesantissima stroncatura del romanzo di John Updike, Toward the End of Time . Non conosco per niente Updike, quindi non posso giudicare i commenti di DFW, abbastanza salaci, ma ripetitivi: DFW colloca Updike, Roth e Bukowksi tra i Grandi Narcisisti, gli scrittori della generazione precedente, sottolineando in modo un po' ironico e un po' critico la loro poetica e il loro esagerato interesse per il proprio s\u00e9 e per la sessualit\u00e0. Ritengo per\u00f2 che accostare Roth a Bukowski e dipingerlo come un narcisista e un fanatico pansessualista ormai sul viale del tramonto (nel 1998!) sia davvero miope e ingeneroso. Le affermazioni wallaciane mi ricordano analoghi commenti ottusi contro Nanni Moretti. Nuoce molto a DFW il particolare stile di scrittura che egli si compiace di adottare: la struttura dei suoi saggi \u00e8 totalmente non lineare e assomiglia a un canapo da rimorchio di quelli tanto odiati da Jerome K. Jerome in Tre uomini in barca . Gi\u00e0 dalla presentazione dell\u2019argomento fioccano nelle prime righe le digressioni (in tema) e le divagazioni (fuori tema), le osservazioni estemporanee, le note a pi\u00e8 di pagina, le note di secondo ordine - note e osservazioni marginali inserite nelle note -, i dialoghi con le lettere puntate, le citazioni etc. etc. La moltiplicazione bulimica delle note e delle digressioni \u00e8 il principale motivo per cui non ho apprezzato per niente il saggio \"Autorit\u00e0 e uso della lingua\" che tra tutti avrebbero dovuto essere il pi\u00f9 stimolante e che ho trovato invece confuso, divagante e logorroico. Il vezzo delle note (spesso a met\u00e0 della frase anzich\u00e9 alla fine) \u00e8 particolarmente nocivo perch\u00e9 DFW non \u00e8 capace di stabilire quando ha senso inserire una nota: molte note sono in realt\u00e0 osservazioni o semplici incisi che potrebbero stare tranquillamente nel testo principale, e altre potrebbero essere cassate perch\u00e9 superflue. Il lettore sballottato da un capo all\u2019altro della pagina perde continuamente il filo del discorso, frantumato dalla frattalizzazione delle note. Il vertice della non linearit\u00e0 si raggiunge nell\u2019ultimo saggio, intitolato \"Commentatore\" e dedicato ai protagonisti dell\u2019 infotainment radiofonico di orientamento conservatore (John Ziegler, Rush Limbaugh etc.): anzich\u00e9 riportate a pi\u00e8 di pagina e numerate, le note sono inserite a casaccio (letteralmente) nel corpo del testo in riquadri e collegate con frecce al brano di testo cui si riferiscono. Il lettore deve zigzagare tra le facciate delle due pagine affiancate e talvolta andare alla pagina successiva e poi tornare indietro come in un labirinto tridimensionale. E, come sempre, ci sono le note nelle note. Se aggiungiamo l\u2019uso fastidiosissimo degli acronimi e del gergo tecnico (inutilmente accurato) e il vezzo di indicare persone e oggetti con abbreviazioni e perifrasi che ben presto stancano per la loro ripetitivit\u00e0, si capisce come bastino poche pagine per perdere completamente la bussola: onestamente, delle circa 70 pagine del saggio, sono riuscito a capire soltanto alcuni aneddoti divertenti e gli interrogativi posti da DFW sul fascino che i commentatori politici di destra esercitino sul popolo americano (vedi pi\u00f9 avanti). Altro problema per il lettore non statunitense \u00e8 la presenza pervasiva di riferimenti alla cultura pop americana (personaggi, luoghi, cibi, programmi radio e tv, pubblicit\u00e0 e cos\u00ec via), al punto che risulta difficile comprendere il senso di certe osservazioni. Questo non \u00e8 certo colpa di DFW, quanto dell\u2019editore italiano, che per\u00f2 non mi sento di accusare: capisco in effetti la preoccupazione di non aggiungere altre note a confondere ulteriormente il lettore. Per caratterizzare un individuo specifico o un tipo il nostro ne elenca i capi di abbigliamento, specificando marca e modello, il cibo e le bevande di cui fa uso e i programmi che guarda. Nell\u2019ultimo saggio, per fare un esempio, si fa cenno continuamente alle vicende giudiziarie di O. J. Simpson e di Scott Peterson: pur avendone sentito parlare, non sono riuscito a comprendere tutti i riferimenti e le battute di DFW. Ultima cosa che mi sento di notare \u00e8 la curiosa suggestione (\u201cfascinazione\u201d \u00e8 forse esagerato) che colpisce un giovane democratico come DFW verso un semifascista guerrafondaio come John McCain: tale suggestione si ritrova anche nel saggio sui programmi radiofonici di infotainment conservatore. DFW insiste molto sulla sincerit\u00e0 di McCain e sul fatto che la gente lo apprezza in virt\u00f9 di questa sincerit\u00e0. Anche se come italiano non sono nella posizione di emettere giudizi sulla politica degli altri Paesi, trovo preoccupante che si debba riconoscere il valore di un uomo politico perch\u00e9 dice ci\u00f2 che pensa, anche quando ci\u00f2 che pensa \u00e8 abominevole (e questo, DFW ce lo dice molto chiaramente). Credo che questa suggestione sia la spia di un serio problema di identit\u00e0 della sinistra in generale. In conclusione, non penso che legger\u00f2 altri saggi di DFW: prover\u00f2 per\u00f2 a leggere - ma fra un po' di tempo - un romanzo, per vedere se riesco ad apprezzarlo almeno come narratore. Consigliato ai renziani. Sconsigliato a chi va subito al punto. ...more I must confess that I am not one of the cult of DFW followers that wallow in his genius ramblings; I honestly appreciated, though did not love, his (universally acknowledged) masterpiece: \"Infinite Jest\"; despite its raw humor, it rambled and meandered WAY too much for me to get a feel for his true storytelling talent.

It seemed almost as if he was using his (arguably infinite, or at least infinitely superior to my) intelligence to slap the reader insensate. (Part of this feeling was no doubt due to my not heeding Dave Eggers' caveat at the beginning of IJ: It's a book that requires 100% of your concentration and attention to fully appreciate it...and I tried plowing through it with a 2-year-old vying for my attention...but still...) I couldn't shake the feeling that he was mocking the unsophisticated reader with his lofty, circuitous (and unfathomable) wit. After reading this collection of essays by DFW, consider me a newly converted devotee. \"Consider the Lobster...\", a collection of essays mostly reprinted (in unexpurgated form) from magazine articles from 1996-2004, is (like IJ) a daunting work to plow through, but it (unlike IJ) takes a modicum of effort to decipher the message(s) propounded, and realize just what a flipping genius DFW was. The collection is a motley assortment that runs the gamut from coverage of the AVN Adult Film Awards (the porn Oscars, if you will), to a detailed diatribe on Standard Written English, hidden within a review of a dictionary. (Sounds dull? Trust me, it's not.) There's a book review of darling tennis player of the 80s Tracy Austin's abysmally written autobiography (totally hilarious, but not in a mocking kind of way); a view behind the scenes of John McCain's 2000 Presidential bid against GW Bush for the GOP nomination (the worst of the collection, but still quite good); an essay on the titular crustacean and the annual Maine Lobster Festival (as featured in Gourmet Magazine in 2004...an article which I can't help but imagine that, if indeed published, singlehandedly led to the death of Gourmet Magazine in 2009...it's that brutal...not to mention f***ing hilarious). My favorite of the bunch, though, is the last one in the book, and it is a doozy. Entitled \"Host\", it focuses its attention on (conservative) talk radio, specifically in Los Angeles (my former home town) at KFI (the second-most popular talk radio station in the US)...DFW, subtly, gently yet decisively CASTIGATES the entire industry in what is arguably the best essay/opinion piece I've ever read. It's a stunner. There's even a \"where was I when...\" article of his experiences immediately following 9/11 while living in Bloomington, Indiana...an article that (for me, anyway) served to humanize DFW, and brought tears to my eyes. This is rather macabre, but at this point in reading I leafed through what I'd read and looked for signs presaging his bout with depression, and ensuing suicide. Much like IJ, \"Consider the Lobster\" (despite its lofty narrative) is imbued with an underlying, palpable sadness that provides (this reader, anyway) an humanistic poignancy that will resonate a very long time. In a word: brilliant. ...more reading dfw takes work. it takes focus and a dictionary, and not the pocket kind that has commonly used words, but the kind with SAT words that is too heavy to carry. you probably have to read dfw at home or with a smart-phone handy. and i still prefer reading him to any other writer. i\u2019ll throw the warning out there that i have an inability to articulate why i like a favourite author\u2019s work (but this doesn\u2019t mean i won\u2019t keep trying). i remember when dfw was writing and speaking about what he we reading dfw takes work. it takes focus and a dictionary, and not the pocket kind that has commonly used words, but the kind with SAT words that is too heavy to carry. you probably have to read dfw at home or with a smart-phone handy. and i still prefer reading him to any other writer. i\u2019ll throw the warning out there that i have an inability to articulate why i like a favourite author\u2019s work (but this doesn\u2019t mean i won\u2019t keep trying). i remember when dfw was writing and speaking about what he went through in rehab and what drove him as an author, etc. he didn\u2019t do it often, but the psychologist in me couldn\u2019t stop looking for interviews and information about these kinds of questions. with his upbringing (strong successful mother\u2019s influence, tennis champion, labeled genius from an early age: here ) he says that one of the things he got from rehab was that geniuses were allowed to have problems and were just like everyone else. he learned that his genius didn\u2019t necessarily make him special. he was no better or worse. when i read his work, what i see is a man who is deeply and genuinely interested in learning new things, on sharing these things and meeting people, ordinary people. sure, there\u2019s an essay on mccain\u2019s 2000 campaign, but there\u2019s also an essay that, at least for me, humanizes the porn industry by covering the \u201cporn oscars.\u201d he talks about how funny kafka is and how few people see it because they\u2019re so busy trying to intellectualize and \u201cget\u201d kafka. reading this book feels like shaking his hand and hearing him talk over coffee, or taking his class and going to lecture. many of these essays would be better suited to being categorized as journalism. he\u2019s asked to report on something, and he\u2019s throwing himself into the narrative and helping to explore larger issues to help relate it to the reader. i can see him following mccain\u2019s campaign with the worn leather coat that he borrowed from a friend, because he still thought that rolling stone magazine was that kind of place. i can see him with his bandana going to the world\u2019s biggest lobster fair and being genuinely disgusted and compelled to share this story of suffering. i know he gets a ton of flack for his style, but it hasn\u2019t stopped me from reading and re-reading almost everything he\u2019s written and i certainly know i\u2019m not the ideal reader for his work. i know i miss a ton of references and probably fail to make some connections that may seem obvious to him. but i\u2019m a student of dfw. i\u2019m happy to re-read his work, to take notes and cringe at the notes i made in the margins the first time around. i feel like people miss out on him because of his reputation and i\u2019d hate for that to stop anyone. i think he deserves a chance and i know damn well he could teach you something. ...more What I look for in a David Foster Wallace book is not so much his much-talked about brilliance, but his humanity. Under the verbal and visual tricks, there was a sensitive man who thought and felt deeply about everything he experienced. He was not what I expected from a \"post-postmodern writer,\" which is to say that he was earnest and genuinely funny, and his writing style seems to be an organic representation of how his brain works, rather than something consciously literary. Reading him feels What I look for in a David Foster Wallace book is not so much his much-talked about brilliance, but his humanity.

He was not what I expected from a \"post-postmodern writer,\" which is to say that he was earnest and genuinely funny, and his writing style seems to be an organic representation of how his brain works, rather than something consciously literary. Reading him feels real. So, this book. I enjoyed every essay, while also thinking that I maybe liked A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again better. The bulk of the essays in that book felt more substantial than the selection here, though \"Up, Simba\" is fantastic . DFW had a real talent for giving fair consideration to people he might disagree with, unless those people are blowhards with few redeeming qualities (i.e. Max Hardcore). That talent came in handy for this book -- at least four of the essays had some sort of political bent. DFW is at his best, I think, when you can see clearly his struggle between his desire for openness/sincerity and his natural cynicism/skepticism/anxiousness. This inner conflict comes out a lot when he profiles people, and is generally why his nonfiction is so great, why Brief Interviews with Hideous Men is so great, and why this book might have been stronger if there were fewer lit crit pieces. At this point, I've got three more of his books to read before I have read everything he had ever written and now, will ever write. This is a sad, sad thought not because I or the world will never have another DFW reading experience, but because there is such humanity and curiosity in his work that makes you think (irrelevantly, in vain) that maybe working through his thoughts in writing could have made him want to stay here. Or maybe not, but it's a shot. ...more Another essay collection by the man I would consider America's foremost essayist. As great a novelist as he is, and he's certainly no slouch with the short story, his non-fiction is beyond compare. I think that this work differs from his previous stuff in that it plays up the author's own dorkiness a lot less than the other ones, although it doesn't even come close to losing it entirely.

Rather, it gets augmented by some level of taking himself seriously that lends a little more credence to his earnest dweebitude. On \"Big Red Son\", a piece about the porn industry, this comes in handy, allowing him to both distance himself and giggle slightly with the reader at the topics being discussed with such frankness. If he's too cool about this, the reader is alienated; too nerdy, and he's creeping the reader out. He walks that fine line perfectly on every piece here. Not only that, there's a definitive post 9/11 thing happening here, and that may be the true cause for his toning down the effete nerd level. Regardless, DFW does what he does best here, and I have to recommend that everyone read this as soon as possible. ...more The math makes this come out at four stars. But I was disappointed. Disappointed in the same way you are when you hear so many rave reviews about a movie and expect it to be the best movie ever and it turns out to be only really good. That said, I'm reading another collection of his essays next and still VERY much look forward to getting into his fiction (which is more my preference than essays anyhow). \"Big Red Son\"--my very first taste of Wallace (I can't bring myself to refer to him as \"DFW\" f The math makes this come out at four stars. But I was disappointed. Disappointed in the same way you are when you hear so many rave reviews about a movie and expect it to be the best movie ever and it turns out to be only really good. That said, I'm reading another collection of his essays next and still VERY much look forward to getting into his fiction (which is more my preference than essays anyhow). \"Big Red Son\"--my very first taste of Wallace (I can't bring myself to refer to him as \"DFW\" for some reason) has left me ambivalent. As a perennial Howard Stern fan, I am familiar with the AVN (Adult Video News) awards; as someone who is alive today, I am familiar with the generally sad/soulless/self-absorbed disposition of most involved in the adult film industry. This piece was nothing special, and it leaves me wondering (worrying?) how much the audience of the periodical for which Foster was writing affected how/what he wrote. It seems obvious that the place of publication would greatly alter his writing, but this isn't something I thought about until now. (2/5) \"Certainly the End of Something or Other\"--very precise, entertaining critique of an Updike novel. Made me wish Wallace wrote reviews on goodreads.(3/5) \"Some Remarks on Kafka's Funniness\"--insightful ideas that I wish were much further developed than this short speech allowed. Great job cutting to the essence of Kafka in very easy to follow language. I like his final assessment of the \"central Kafka joke: that the horrific struggle to establish a human self results in a self whose humanity is inseparable from that horrific struggle\" (64). (3/5) \"Authority and American Usage\"--marvelous, brilliant, laugh-inducing AND a review of a grammar book. DFW's (I'm sold) ability to combine such erudition and to drop so many \"big names\" without at all coming across as unbearably erudite or pretentious in the least is quite a feat. For example, within two sentences (dedicated to the ills of wearing pants) he uses both \"pants can squish the 'nads\" and that they are \"an androsartorial norm\" (94-5). A delightful essay that I would love to write more about, but now I am eager to begin the next. (5/5) \"The View from Mrs. Thompson's\"--a 9/11 piece that really isn't anything special until the very last line, which inspires serious thought and reflection. (3/5) \"How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart\"--another scathing book review that approaches far deeper issues than just the quality of the book. (4/5) \u201cUp, Simba\u201d\u2014 The longest essay so far, this gonzo-esque article find Wallace following McCain\u2019s 2000 GOP Primary campaign trail. Surprisingly, politics are almost wholly absent from the piece. Rather, readers get complete, in-depth look at what it\u2019s like to be on the campaign trail. There are a few poignant analyses of the cynicism and evil-genius-but-also-sort-of-juvenile marketing that goes into a campaign and how little the whole thing itself is actually about real politics and who can even tell when a candidate is truly talking about real politics or when he is just portraying a carefully constructed image. Historical perspective: with only eleven years of hindsight, it is so tough not to have an indelible opinion of both Bush and McCain already, hence to scoff at some of the (for Wallace) perceived bullshit that is now known to be absolute bullshit. (2.5 or 3/5) \u201cConsider the Lobster\u201d\u2014No wonder this is the titular essay: it is the best of the bunch. Wallace\u2019s experiences at and musings inspired by the Maine Lobster Festival are the first to make me consistently laugh aloud. Then, pages later I was actually close to tearing up; in fact, I used part of this selection in my evening class to teach effective use of pathos. Wallace\u2019s thoughts really are all over the place\u2014the article is essentially every lobster related tangent that you could imagine\u2014but they are so easy and entertaining to follow while at the same time being far-reaching and deep. (5/5!) \"Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky\"--apparently Frank is to Dostoevsky what Boyd is to Nabokov (times two). Also, after reading this one I realize that if I continue to read DFW's essays, I am going to run out of ways to say \"deep/insightful/thought-provoking\" etc. Every piece has a clear enough topic, but meanders (gracefully) into DFW's own d/i/t-p queries raised by said topic. (4/5) \"Host\"--Rather than footnotes, Wallace employs a retarded (well they slow the reader down, at least) connection of text boxes. This was very bothersome, most so because it really felt like forced/trendy/dare-to-be-different-to-be-cool-and-anti-norm. Aside from that, the content was sterling.

How do I ever know whether I'm bullshitting myself, morally speaking (257) I have been reading this collection of DFW's essays intermittently since (I just checked) November 13, 2012. I turned to Consider the Lobster: And Other Essays primarily because of specific interest in two essays: one on Kafka, the other on Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky (as an avowed Dostoevskyphile and Kafkaphile these couldn't be missed, or so I figured [and wasn't wrong]). I had the book in electronic form, and read aforementioned essays on my laptop during one particularly uninspiring class (on climate ethics \u2013 no conclusions should be drawn from this fact, though). Both essays were wonderful, and I subsequently read the essay on the porn industry, called Big Red Son , as well, which was intriguing and amusing without being enduring in an 'I must re-read this someday' sense. In fact, when a few weeks ago I decided to buy myself a physical copy of the collection \u2013 since the electronic version was not really working, not drawing me in again \u2013 I did not re-read Big Red Son , although I did re-read both the Kafka and Frank's Dostoevsky pieces. I did, however, read the other, remaining essays in the span of a few days: Certainly the End Of Something Or Other, One Would Sort Of Have To Think , a scathing and downright hilarious review of John Updike's Toward the End of Time ; Authority and American Usage , a fascinating review of Bryan Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage ; The View From Mrs. Thompson's , a recounting of the (his [DFW's]) moments during and after the 9/11 attacks; How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart , a review of former tennis starlet Tracy Austin's inevitably highly disappointing autobiography; Up, Simba , which traces DFW's experiences during John McCain's 2000 campaign trail, of which he took part and on which he reported for Rolling Stone magazine; Consider the Lobster , on the Maine Lobster festival of 2003 and on the question of whether 1) lobsters feel pain, and 2) whether this matters, and, finally; Host , on The John Ziegler Show and (conservative, right-wing) talk radio more generally. I read these them with a strange kind of urgency and joy and compassion and understanding, finishing the last of them today, on August 1, 2016. You might even say that I was inspired, in the non-clich\u00e9, original sense, un-cynical-DFW kind of way. p.s. Always hold the book in your hands. ...more A series of lucid, well-written, essays on a variety of topics.

Is it the product of actual thought? Or do you just not want to think about it?\u201d Will the Maine Lobster festival be seen decades from now much as we view the Roman games? This is not the kind of book you want to listen to in the car with your kids or grand-kids. In the third essay, his descriptions of events at the Adult Video awards (which began in 1982 coincident with the rise of VCRs.) The exhibits at their convention got even my normally unflappable nature perturbed. The idea that an exhibitor would have a starlet squatting on his table masturbating with a riding crop was a bit much. The judges for the awards have to sit through the equivalent of 1.4 years of sexual coupling and after their eyes glazed over I suspect their \u201cmembers\u201d (to quote Fanny Hill) probably locked into a permanently flaccid state much like workers in chocolate factories who are permitted to eat all the chocolate they want, soon develop a positive distaste for the stuff. All of this leads me to an observation. Many of the essays reveal a deep concern on the part of Wallace for wanting to examine all the moral ramifications of his subject. I'm beginning to understand why he committed suicide. He must have deeply disturbed by what he discovered. ...more Considera la vita.

Detto questo, mi rendo conto che ancora una volta la lettura di DFW mi lascia non solo ammirato e appagato, come mi accade con altri seppur pochi scrittori, ma anche influenzato, in qualche modo che non riesco a definire meglio, nel modo di osservare le cose, gli avvenimenti, i fenomeni della nostra epoca e di valutarne gli effetti sulla mia sensibilit\u00e0 e in definitiva sulla mia vita. Vedere la tv, leggere i giornali, guardarsi attorno, \u201csotto l\u2019influsso\u201d della lettura di Wallace come si fosse sotto l\u2019effetto di una sostanza psicotropa, approfondisce l\u2019acume della propria percezione, esercita lo sguardo all\u2019ironia (e all\u2019autoironia), a cogliere l\u2019aspetto esilarante dei comportamenti cos\u00ec come a percepirne i risvolti spaventosi e angoscianti, a cimentarsi nel distinguere dietro le apparenze gli innumerevoli strati dei significati nascosti come in una serie di matrioske.

The final \"Host\" was a fairly fascinating portrait of conservative talk radio and its meteoric rise in the last decade and a half or so, and reprises DFW's notable skills in rendering breathless, funny, and richly detailed eyewitness accounts. Actually, those same skills were also on display in the the nearly-as-good McCain 2000 campaign saga \"Up Simba\", which has recently been republished in its own book in light of the current campaign (as it should be, perhaps, though the essay seems more broadly to set its sights on politics and political journalism in general than to actual focus on McCain himself). The rest of the book was largely devoted to book reviews, which, though erudite and interesting, and often turned to larger questions than those concerning any single book, were still somewhat less gripping reading. But then, I rarely read essays at all, so it's sort of surprising that I enjoyed this even as much as I did. ...more<---C>David Foster Wallace</---C><+++>Consider the Lobster and Other Essays</+++>", "Title": "Consider the Lobster and Other Essays"},
