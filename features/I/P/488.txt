Okay so I'm pretty sure anything I say will be a spoiler since everyone knows how hardcore I ship Jem & Tessa so my reading thoughts will be in the spoiler tag. DO NOT READ IT IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also warning that the comments of this post now have spoilers. I'm also going to start posting spoiler fan art there so keep away from the comments of this review until you finish reading. You can DM me to discuss the spoiler stuff. But keep calm Jessa fans and wait for the epilogue :-D (view spoiler) [ Dying to know what people think of the ending?!?!?! I don't know whether to love it or hate it. I mean it feels like a cheap ploy to keep both sides happy but I feel like I should just be happy with that. The epilogue is a Jessa shippers dream come true! But even though it is technically a happy ending I was balling my eyes out through the entire book. I mean Jem was so sweet, adorable, loving, selfless and perfect!!! He didn't want anyone to get hurt over him and just loved with all his heart. He is seriously like the most perfect character ever. <3 OMG I LOVE YOU JAMES CARSTAIRS!!!! I cried when he found out about Will's feelings and said he would have broken off the engagement. I cried when he said that he wanted Tessa to grow to love Will. I cried when he said he wanted to see Charlotte's baby. I cried when he said silent brotherhood was his only choice. Then I really seriously balled my eyes out when Jem said goodbye to Tessa and Will. They had to live without him?!?!!? OMG!!! Then I as so happy during the epilogue that I cried some more. Finally 130 years later he gets to have a happy life with Tessa!!!!!!!!!!!! I wonder if we will get to see him and Tessa together in The Mortal Instruments?! Or The Dark Artifices?!?!?! I'm still kind of confused by the timelines of all this?! I believe Mortal Instruments is 2007 and the epilogue was 2008 so maybe a chance for Dark Artifices?! So things that did piss me off. Really?!?! Jem was dying and Tessa didn't sleep with him but RIGHT AFTER THEY THOUGHT JEM DIED she slept with Will because she thought he might die?!?!?! And then at least after that they took time but I thought it was because Will was giving Tessa time to grieve and himself time to grieve but really he was just scared that Tessa wouldn't love him like she did Jem?! Well of course not because Jem is so much better than you! But whatever Will died and now Tessa is with Jem!!!!! Over all her lifetime with Will and 71 years after his death she still never stopped loving Jem or wearing his necklace!!!!!!!!!!! AWWWWWWWW!!!

He looked at her with a light in his thin face that made it more beautiful. \"Wo xi wang ni ming tian ke yi jia gei wo.\" \"You...<---F>\" She drew her brows together</---F>. \"You want to get married? But we already are engaged. I do not thing on can get engaged twice.\" \"I said I would marry you tomorrow if I could.\" \"There will be another time,\" she said. \"Another day, another dress. A time when you are well and everything is perfect.\" \"There is no such thing as prefect, Tessa.\" Foreshadowing to their future wedding that takes place after the epilogue?!?! \"It is a strange thing,<---M> to be in love</---M>,\" he said. \"It changes you.\" \"Zhe shi jie shang, wo shi zui ai ne de,\" he whispered. She understood it. In all the world, you are what I love the most. \"Tessa, did you imagine that there exists any quarrel, large or small, that could make me stop loving you?\" \"Did you like it?\" he said. \"I could have given you...jewelry, but I wanted it to be something that was wholly yours. That no one else would hear or own. And I am not good with words, so I wrote how I felt about you in music.\" He paused. \"Did you like it?\" \"Then you did like it.\" \"It was like I saw your soul in the notes of the music. And it was beautiful.\" \"Every heard has its own melody,\" he said. \"You know mine.\" \"I would give you everything of myself,\" he said. \"I would give you more in two weeks than most men would give you in a lifetime.\" \"When two people are as one in their inmost hearts, they shatter even the strength of iron or bronze.\" \"I can choose to be as much for her as I can be, to burn as brightly for her as I wish.\" \"You asked me if I have loved anyone but Will,\" she said. \"And the answer is yes. I have loved you. I always have, and I always will.\" (hide spoiler) ] <+++>Clockwork Princess</+++> snippets! Tessa reached to brush the damp hair from his forehead. He leaned into her touch, his eyes closing. \u201cJem\u2014have you ever\u2014\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHave you ever thought of ways to prolong your life that are not a cure for the drug?\u201d At that his eyelids flew open. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She thought of Will, on the floor of the attic, choking on holy water. \u201cBecoming a vampire. You would live forever\u2014\u201d He scrambled upright against the pillows of the bed. \u201cTessa, no. Don\u2019t\u2014you can\u2019t think that way.\u201d \u201cIs the thought of becoming a Downworlder truly so horrible to you?\u201d \u201cTessa \u2026\u201d He exhaled slowly. \u201cI am a Shadowhunter. Nephilim. Like my parents before me. It is the heritage I claim, just as I claim my mother\u2019s heritage as part of myself. It does not mean I hate my father. But I honor the gift they gave me, the blood of the Angel, the trust placed in me, the vows I have taken. Nor, I think, would I make a very good vampire. [redacted for spoilers] I would no longer be Will\u2019s parabatai, no longer be welcome in the Institute. No, Tessa. I would rather die and be reborn and see the sun again, than live to the end of the world without daylight.\u201d \u201cA Silent Brother, then,\u201d she said. His eyes softened slightly. \u201cThe path of Silent Brotherhood is not open to me.\u201d ----- Will\u2019s eyes met Tessa\u2019s as she came closer, almost tripping again over the torn hem of her gown. For a moment, they were in perfect understanding. Jem was what they could still look each other straight in the eye about. On the topic of Jem, they were both fierce and unyielding. Tessa saw Will\u2019s hand tighten on Jem\u2019s sleeve. \u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d he said. Jem\u2019s eyes opened slowly. Tessa fought to keep the look of shock from her face. His pupils were blown out, his irises a thin ring of silver around the black. \u201cNi shou shang le ma, qin ai de?\u201d he whispered. \"Are you hurt, my love?\" OMG What happened to Jem?!?!?! CRIES! ----- \u201cWo wei ni xie de,\u201d he said, as he raised the violin to his left shoulder, tucking it under his chin. He had told her many violinists used a shoulder rest, but he did not: there was a slight mark on the side of his throat, like a permanent bruise, where the violin rested. \u201cYou \u2014 made something for me?\u201d Tessa asked. \u201cI wrote something for you,\u201d he corrected, with a smile, and began to play. ----- \u201cThough Will was saying earlier,\u201d Tessa added, \u201cthat heroes all come to bad ends, and he could not imagine why anyone would want to be one, anyway.\u201d \u201cAh.\u201d Jem\u2019s hand squeezed hers briefly, and then let it go. \u201cWell, Will is looking at it from the hero\u2019s viewpoint, isn\u2019t he? But as for the rest of us, it\u2019s an easy answer.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d His voice was almost a whisper now. \u201cHeroes endure because we need them. Not for their own sakes. If Will \u2026\u201d ----- \u201cYou do not want to help us,\u201d Will said to Magnus. \u201cYou do not want to position yourself as an enemy of Mortmain\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWell, can you blame him?\u201d Woolsey rose in a whirl of yellow silk. \u201cWhat could you possibly have to offer that would make the risk worth it to him?\u201d \u201cI will give you anything,\u201d said Tessa in a low voice that Will felt in his bones. \u201cAnything at all, if you can help us help Jem.\u201d Magnus gripped a handful of his black hair. \u201cGod, the two of you. I can make inquiries. Track down some of the more unusual shipping routes. Old Molly \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been to her,\u201d Will said. \u201cSomething\u2019s frightened her so badly she won\u2019t even crawl out of her grave.\u201d Woolsey snorted. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t tell you anything, little Shadowhunter? Is it really worth all this, just to stretch your friend\u2019s life out another few months, another year? He will die anyway. And the sooner he dies, the sooner you can have his fianc\u00e9e, the one you\u2019re in love with.\u201d He cut his amused gaze toward Tessa. \u201cReally you ought to be counting down the days till he expires with great eagerness.\u201d Who is this Woolsey douchebag and where is he so I can shove my foot up his ass?!

By the way, here's my pre-review: (view spoiler) [ WHO WILL IT BE????? Wouldn't you pay a thousand JEMS to know. ...That awful pun was almost as groan-inducing as the love triangle itself. 01/01/12 I was extremely bored and alone on New Year's Eve so I read this review and groaned again (partly because of my pun, partly because I was remembering the love triangle and Jem's marriage proposal) and I decided to rant about it. See below! **Now with mini BONUS rant!** So obviously we know that Tessa and Will will end up together. I mean c'mon lady-- could you make it any more predictable? Part of the problem is that everyone (read: all prepubescent twihard fangirls) WANTS WillTessa and so Ms Clare will grant their wishes and fulfill their fantasies. But dare I ask the question; Why is Jem the inferior love interest? *millions of fan girls give me the evil eye* Okay, there is the problem of Will's curse and blah blah blah he's such a poor unfortunate soul (hey isn't that a song from the little mermaid?) Freaky isn't it? How she can turn people into little slimy things? Who knows, maybe one day she'll turn all twilight fans to mush right before my eyes OR take away Bella's voice so that she can't whine anymore? Ahhh the possibilities are endless..... Ooops. Sorry. Where was I? Oh right. Will's \"curse\". SOO--- HEARTBROKEN and DEVASTATED Will has to push Tessa away because he lurves her too freaking much because of said \"curse\".. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND-- Jem loves her too and is also suffering AND he seems so much sexier (I have to begrudgingly admit that the romance is written very well) so how is it fair that Tessa always loves Will more? It isn't fair. YA isn't fair. LIFE isn't fair. P.S. NO HATE INTENDED! I love these books. I just hate love triangles on principle.

This series has been one of my favorites for the past couple years and it's always been in the back of my mind. So now that it's over I'm not sure what to do with myself. Guess I'll just have to read some more books. I'm going to try to make this as spoiler free as possible. \"You know that feeling,\" she said, \"when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing close around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if bring dragged behind a carriage, and you cannot let go or turn the course aside.\" That quote from the book basically sums up my feelings while I was reading. There was no way this book could have ended without some sort of heartbreak. And believe me the ending was so heartbreaking but also so sweet. The characters were absolutely amazing and so realistic. I cared about all of them (which is very rare since I'm kind of picky about the characters I like). But all of them were unique and had their own story that made them who they were. After risking so much, I was so glad that most of them got their happy endings. The love triangle in this book is how a love triangle should be written. Many books have love triangles but most of them are nothing like the Will-Tessa-Jem love triangle. I actually liked both guys in the love triangle (I ship Will and Tessa but I still love Jem). Loving both guys is just a recipe for heartbreak. The relationships between all the characters was also another part of the book that I love. Will and Jem's friendship made them like brothers and it was so heartbreaking when Will or Jem would think of when they were children or the adventures they had. I sobbed whenever Will thought of the first time he met Jem. Even though Tessa can't fight like the Shadowhunters she's still powerful in her own way. I loved how she was so determined and willing to give anything to protect the people that she loves. I'm definitely going to miss her as a main character. <+++>Clockwork Princess</+++> was a much darker read than the other two books in the series. Despite that, the book had me laughing. Not as often as in the other books but the little bits of humor were perfectly timed. The sarcasm in all of Cassandra Clare's books never fails to make me laugh. The ending was actually very satisfying even though I was crying so much I couldn't even read the page. I totally called who Brother Zachariah was but I never would have guessed the twist at the very end of the book. When you read this book I highly recommend keeping a box of tissues close by just so you're prepared. Now I must say goodbye to one of my favorite series and the characters I have come to love. Before reading Dear Tessa Choose Will! You obviously love him even if you won't admit it! I do think that you love Jem but not the same way you love Will. Just remember that Will loves you and you are tearing him apart! I would be happy as long as you don't end up with Jem! ...more You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog! ____________________________________________ \u201cLife is a book and there are a thousand pages I have not yet read.\u201d ____________________________________________ \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u26065 BEST I HAVE EVEN GIVEN STARS!\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Clockwork Angel Review!

Clockwork Prince Review! I have finished this book for about 3 hours ago and I still can't believe the series is over.This pure perfection,this amazing thrilling story,this everything.I have been so caught up with this series these past two weeks and I don't want this to end.I consider myself a fool for not reading this before,for listening to people who told me to not even bother to try this.I can't imagine how can people dislike this,with it's perfectly plot and characters and the awesome writing.At least show respect for this great,beyond good novel. ____________________________________________ \u201cYou endure what is unbearable, and you bear it. That is all.\u201d ____________________________________________ This is my favorite series of 2014,maybe my all time favorite.I know I will read other awesome books,books I will love and cheer but this one,the whole series actually,will always have a space in my colossal vitality of imagination. ____________________________________________ \u201cTessa craned her head back to look at Will. \u201cYou know that feeling,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing tight around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage and you cannot let go or turn the course aside.\u201d His blue eyes were dark with understanding \u2014 of course Will would understand \u2014 and she hurried on. \u201cI feel now as if the same is happening, only not to characters on a page but to my own beloved friends and companions. I do not want to sit by while tragedy comes for us. I would turn it aside, only I struggle to discover how that might be done.\u201d \u201cYou fear for Jem,\u201d Will said. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I fear for you, too.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Will said, hoarsely. \u201cDon\u2019t waste that on me, Tess.\u201d ____________________________________________ The writing style is perfect.This series is written in third person,but yet I couldn't help but admire the writing.The greatness lies in the way author has collided the quotes of classics with the chapters,the time the book is written with the way they speak,the manners and habits with the characters' personality.Everything clings perfectly. ____________________________________________ \u201cSometimes one must choose whether to be kind or honorable,\" he said. \"Sometimes one cannot be both.\u201d ____________________________________________ This series has made me not just respect,but admire poetry.Also I dig the series so much because the characters talk books,in their unique ways,talk books as they were part of their lives,talk books as they are a treasure worth having. ____________________________________________ \u201cI am catastrophically in love with you.\u201d ____________________________________________ Clockwork Princess is a beautiful,yet thrilling sequel with everything in it.The characters are fully developed and it reflects the plot and the lives,intentions,desires and dreams of characters.Also you can feel and see them being free and finally choosing what they truly want,what they truly are. ____________________________________________ \u201cIt has been the privilege and the honor of my life to know you.\u201d ____________________________________________ And as the other books,this one contains the sense of humor I likely want to read in novels.It comes so natural and freely,especially with Will,he is the master of jokes. ____________________________________________ \u201cAnd now I need you to do for me what I cannot do for myself. For you to be my eyes when I do not have them. For you to be my hands when I cannot use my own. For you to be my heart when mine is done beating.\u201d ____________________________________________ I can't part this book.I enjoyed every word and chapter.The beginning was thrilling because the second book ended with a cliff,the middle also exciting because something happens and you can't help but read more and more,and the ending because it's perfection.The best ending ever written.And I am talking about the epilogue. ____________________________________________ \u201cDo not seek revenge and call it justice.\u201d ____________________________________________ So the epilogue .I don't want to spoil anything but this is the best epilogue ever written.I read it in one breath.It's the most emotional part of the whole series and it's the reality of the characters,the ones we grew up to love and respect. ____________________________________________ \u201cMost people are lucky to have even one great love in their life.

Not to be loved or not to be able to love: that is worse.\u201d ____________________________________________ I want to mention some of my favorite moments in this book(This contains spoilers so if you haven't read the book,skip this part) I really liked when Will rides the horse up to the hills.I could visualize it with all the background,the horse running,the air pumping.It reminded me of some of my childhood animation movies and I dig those times so much. ____________________________________________ \u201cThere is more to living than not dying.\u201d ____________________________________________ I also liked all the scene with Cecily,especially the one with her in the back of the worm.It was a badass move,and the whole scene was full of action and excitement. ____________________________________________ \u201cAtque in pepetuum, frater, ave atque vale,\u201d he whispered. The words of the poem had never seemed so fitting: Forever and ever, my brother, hail and farewell.\u201d ____________________________________________ And of course the scene with Tessa turning into the angel and crushing the Magister. Beside chills ,it gave me lots of joy because the madman was finally dead. ____________________________________________ \u201cFor this I would be damned forever. For this I would have given up everything.\u201d ____________________________________________ The characters Tessa Tessa is one of my favorite main characters.She is strong,determined and caring and sometimes I could see her sense of humor.She has developed so much and she has proved herself to be a faithful person.Also at her age she handles greatly the affections with pride and loyalty. Will Will has also all the great qualities a man should have,but what I liked about him was that he doesn't play the perfect innocent person.I must say the way he handled the situation with the curse was to be admired.Also the humor,even though I can't understand why he hates ducks! James Jem,as Will contains the best qualities a person could contain,and also because of that and the fact that he is dying and he perfectly handles that makes you idol this character. Cecily I was introduced to this character in the third book,but I truly like her.She is carefree and she talks without hesitations.Also she is one hell of a badass chick and the way she talks is so fun to read. ____________________________________________ \u201cAt last, the wheel comes full circle\u201d ____________________________________________ I highly recommend this series to every reader out there.It's everything you wish to find in a book and gives you a new way to see the world.I personally hesitated to read this one but now I regret only one thing,that I haven't picked this one before.I learned so much from this and for that I am truly grateful. ____________________________________________ \u201cOne does no question miracles, or complain that they are no constructed perfectly to one's liking.\u201d ____________________________________________ Thank you Cassandra Clare,thank you! ...more I officially died and went to heaven when I finally got this book in my hands. And it was freaking amazing. Everything about this book was perfect, and it ended absolutely perfectly. And it was SO. SAD. OH DEAR JESUS. I couldn't handle the level of sadness.

From the bottom of my heart. --- Okay quick recap of what happened in City of Lost Souls and all the ipothetical hints CC gave us: *foul language aheaaaaaaaaad.* (JK. Sort of. I only use \"fucking\" to underline the concept.) (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] a) a strong warlock woman helped Magnus put the spell on Clary when she was a kid. This one's easy. That's Tessa. b) Brother Zachariah enters the scene. This one is much more fucking difficult and has got me pulling my hair out trying to decipher it. [YES, CASSANDRA CLARE, YOU'RE SUCCEEDING IN YOUR EVIL PLAN TO MAKE YOUR READERS GO CRAZY. CONGRATS.] So, here's the thing: Brother Zachariah seems to be more open to talk than the other Silent Brothers. He tells Maryse he had a life, and he would have risked it for the people he loved. It's either Will or Jem. There's no real explanation, because there could've been hundreds of other Shadowhunters who corresponded to that description, but here Cassandra Clare is clearly sending us a message so we're taking it. Now the question is, WHO THE FUCK OF THE TWO IS IT? Maryse mentions the fact that his eyes are covered, so she can't see them. Well duh. I didn't even expect to be able to. By now I know Cassandra Clare better. But anyway: at first I thought it was clearly Will, because of his eyes. His eyes are blue, a blue so dark that it's almost black, and I figured they would attract attention. So I was like, if Maryse can't see his eyes, they're probably Will's. Because blue eyes like his are so much rare than Jem's dull brown one. (I figured Jem would've found a way to get back to normal. Otherwise he wouldn't have been able to survive that long, would he? Not to mention that his pale skin would be noticeable.) But then I slapped myself for being such an idiot. OF COURSE Jem's eyes would be noticeable. They're fucking Asian eyes. *sigh* And that takes me back to the previous question, WHO THE FUCK IS BROTHER ZACHARIAH? c) It's not really a C, it would be more like a sub-close B, but whatever. I'm still on brother Zachariah. Despite my earlier suspicions that we was indeed Will, I'm starting to think that maybe it's Jem. At nearly the end of the book, when I-can't-remember-who asked him if there had been people he really cared about in his life, he replies that he would have risked his life for TWO PEOPLE. And here you're saying, \"well, so what? I would've risked it for Tessa and Jem.\" And you'd be right. But wait. Unless he's a total monster, he also has a sister to care about. So he'd risk his life for THREE PEOPLE, wouldn't he? Or maybe his sister dies. And that is a maybe. Because after that there would only be two people to protect. But still. If he really is Brother Zachariah, then Jem would've been long dead before that. So at that point he should've just said ONE PERSON, meaning Tessa, who's probably still alive. So what? WHAT? Either a) Cassandra Clare momentarily forgot of Will's sister, Cecily; or b) Brother Zachariah is Jem. Oh and by the way, they said Brother Zachariah has a chiseled cheekbone. Didn't Will have a chiseled cheekbone? Or was it Jem? WHO WAS IT? D: d) It's also true that looking at the kids now, I wouldn't know where Jace came from. If Jace had come from Cecily's line, then he wouldn't have the Herondale name. She's a woman, so he would assume the father's name. Otherwise it could be Will's. But if he was, then Will couldn't be Brother Zachariah. But maybe Will and Tessa ended up together, and had children (because maybe Tessa was some kind of special warlock), and Jem became a Silent Brother? That's a possibility. Though there still is something unclear about it: Why do the Lightwoods have Will's features (black hair blue eyes), and Jace does not? I would say that maybe Cecily ends up with Gabriel or something. That way, hte Lightwoods would inherit her features, which are also Will's. But Jace? I don't know what to make of him. I really don't. He MUST come from Will. Because he has the surname. But I don't know how. Will and Tessa are completely different from him :o Unless he ended up with someone else entirely.. e) The book. Clary and Jace find A TALE OF TWO CITIES in Valentine's apartment. I still have to understand what the hell's that book doing in Valentine's apartment, but that'll come in time I guess. What I'm mostly interested in is what Will wrote on it. \"WITH HOPE AT LAST.\" NOW, WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN? Let's quickly review the story in the book: Lucy (aka Tessa?) has got two men drooling on her: Charles Darnay [aka Jem aka the boring one (don't glare at me, Clary said that u.u)] and Syndey Carton (aka Will aka WOW.) Lucy decides to marry Charles, while Syndey still loves her. In the end, Syndey decides to sacrifice his life to save Charles', and dies. Lucy and Charles live happily ever after. (I would add \"with a daughter\", but that hardly seems fair since poor Tessa can't have children) So yeah. That is pretty much the story, ignoring all the \"irrelevant\" events, since we're only concentrating on the romance here. So here's the thing: either a) Cassandra Clare decides to be completely un-innovative (which wouldn't be her style) and goes with the same plot of ATOTC, making Tessa end up with Jem; or b) Tessa ends up with Will once and for all; c) Tessa at first ends up with Jem but then he dies; d) Tessa ends up alone. Knowing Cassandra Clare, I would sadly opt for c or d. Especially reading that \"the ruined gold of her wedding dress\" line that has us all on the edge. But wait, I wasn't finished, was I? I was still analyzing Will's words. So, \"with hope at last.\" It could mean that, unlike Carton, he has hope to be with Tessa. But that wouldn't seem right. Couldn't he just say it face-to-face instead of writing it in a book? It doesn't make sense. OR it could mean that he too dies, with hope at last that everything will be okay? That too seems too forced. Or MAYBE, just MAYBE, he means tha the has hope at last because Tessa is immortal and he is Brother Zachariah, so they can go on together, if not actually TOGETHER in the literal sense of the word. I can't see any other interpretations for that sentence, and I've been babbling for about half an hour, making this review so fucking long, and the book isn't even out yet. So I' guess I'll stop. I still have to read the teasers for City of Heavenly Fire and the letter from Stephen to Jace, so maybe I'll have more to say after that. You just wait. -- So I just read the famous letter from Will to Tessa. Okay. So scratch my point \"e\". It's all useless now. *sigh* Update : ohmyfreakingabsoluteshit. In case you don't have a tumblr account, this is what Cassandra Clare just posted on her profile: Now, what. the eff. is this. supposed to mean, Cassandra Clare? WHO IS SAYING THIS?! WHO!?!?? I MIGHT DIE. I MIGHT SURELY DIE BEFORE THIS DAMN BOOK COMES OUT. *taking steady breaths to write a few coherent thoughts* On a macabre side, I'd rather have it be Jem so Tessa'll end up with Will. OR, as afore-mentioned in one of my theories, Jem will die and Tessa and Will will be forever separated because they won't have the guts to get together after that. But if it's Will.. oh shoot. It can't be Will. It can't. :( But what if it is? Of course, thinking about it, it could be about anyone in the trilogy. I focused myself on Will and Jem solely because I love them too much to see either of them dying. So you see how NOT KNOWING is driving me nuts. Why do authors necessarily have to do this? Posting such snippets and then leaving us wondering for another six months, I mean? That is really too cruel. (hide spoiler) ] Into the actual review ~ I don't know what to fucking say. Seriously. I'm speechless. Once again Cassandra Clare has left me speechless. And this time I'm not sure in a good way. THAT EPILOGUE. Are you for real, Cassandra? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I don't even know how to rate it. Honestly. Throughout the whole book I thought this was going to be perfect but then that epilogue fucking killed me. I just.. It's like I always saw the characters and the story under a certain light but with the events of the epilogue everything has changed. (view spoiler) [Tessa, how the fuck could you do that? How could you be with Jem after Will? That's what bothers me. Jem was kind, and he was a really good person but you just CAN'T. TELL. ME. Tessa loved him as much as she loved Will. You just can't do that. I'm pretty sure if Jem had never made a move with Tessa, she would have just regarded him as friend. It's Will who had her heart since the very beginning and it's Will she still kept thinking about when she was engaged to Jem. If she'd been with Will, I highly doubt she would've been thinking about Jem the same way. Team Jem, tell me, am I wrong? I think not. I think you could say any single beautiful thing you can think of about Jem, or about the couple Jem and Tessa, but it's FREAKING CLEAR she loved more Will. Even if some people hated him. Even if some people thought he didn't deserve her or vice-versa. She loved him more and I can't conceive how she could put both loves on the same level. They were NOT on the same level. I just.. I'm so disappointed. I've loved Tessa's character for the whole trilogy but with that last bit my faith in her just fell to pieces. I guess I can understand her in a way, I mean Will was dead and she cared about Jem and he cared about her, but the single fact that she said she loved them in the same way, that she never did recognize that Will was her only true love, really disappointed me. It really did. Of course I don't expect her to be lonely forever, as that would just be cruel, but seeing Tessa with someone other than Will already pains me, and hearing her SAY she loved Jem as much as Will was like an arrow through my already bleeding heart (feeling poetic tonight). (hide spoiler) ] (view spoiler) [Btw, HAHA! If you've read the conjectures I'd written BEFORE reading the book, did you see how many of them I got right? Read point D. LMFAO, I'm feeling like a freaking genius right now. Too bad I didn't brace myself for the epilogue.. (hide spoiler) ] I would even rate it one star just because of that ending, because it fucking changed EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. So what do I do? Five stars, one star? I know, I'm on opposite poles, but I just can't give it three stars. It would minimize everything. So.. I don't know. I really don't. I think I won't rate this. And I'm anxiously waiting for the last TMI book and then for The Dark Artifices books because I want more TID and I hope, expect, and WANT Cassandra to talk about it and make us see what happened next. (by the way, so that's why Jace has that star tattoo! Awwh, I'm gonna die of cuteness here) P.S.: I liked how The Infernal Devices both started and ended on the Bridge. Nice touch, Cassie. P.P.S.: Of course I can't say anything about CC's writing because she's like my writing goddess. Also, I really hold this trilogy close to heart because it's the first one I've been following since the beginning. I had never had to wait for all books in a series to come out, I'd always started when at least two or three were already out. So I feel like I grew up with this trilogy, and it was so heart-breaking to see it end. (and WHAT AN ENDING -.-) So.. no matter the ending, and whether I liked it or not, this is my favorite paranormal series. (I'm sorry Vampire Academy, you've been displaced) [Btw, disconnected thought: I love Magnus so freaking bad.] kbye. See you at The Dark Artifices . - Edit : It's been noted that actually Tessa's behavior at the end of the book was pretty self-less. (view spoiler) [She'd had to lose Will once and the pain had been great, but she chose to do it all over again with Jem for love's sake. (hide spoiler) ] I honestly hadn't see it under that light, concentrating on how she hadn't been fair in coming to terms with her feelings. So I have to give her that. I'm still confused, though.. I still don't know how to rate this book. But.. now I'm more inclined towards a positive rate. Edit2 : Reading Cassandra Clare's post on tumblr about the ending, I'm a bit less angry now. I think.. I think she really meant to build a balanced love triangle, where nobody was loved more or less than another. I also think that maybe it wasn't her intention to make us think she loved (view spoiler) [Will (hide spoiler) ] more than (view spoiler) [Jem (hide spoiler) ] . Thirdly, I think, at least that's what it sounded to me, that she didn't wholly succeed in doing that as I always thought she loved (view spoiler) [Will (hide spoiler) ] more than (view spoiler) [Jem (hide spoiler) ] . And lastly, I think Cassandra Clare and I may have slightly different ideas on love, so I'm taking that into consideration. But.. now that I get her initial intention, I understand the ending better. Still not giving a rate though, sorry.

The Infernal Devices has been one wild ride right from the very first page of Clockwork Angel. I binge read all three books and I have MY HEART HURTS. I'VE NEVER FELT THIS BROKEN OVER A BOOK BEFORE.

The Infernal Devices has been one wild ride right from the very first page of Clockwork Angel. I binge read all three books and I have absolutely no regrets other than the fact that I loathe myself for not reading these books any sooner. Now that I finally completed this prequel series, I can say with utmost confidence that The Infernal Devices is far more superior compared to The Mortal Instruments. The feelings I had while reading first three books of The Mortal Instruments doesn't even come close to the feelings I had while reading this whole series. The Infernal Devices was, hands down, just all around better. The characters were better. The plot was better. Even Cassandra's writing was better. I had no major complaints whatsoever while reading The Infernal Devices. The greatest thing about this series was not the action, not the romance, but the bond between Jem and Will. Although I am a Wessa shipper to the max, I am a Jem and Will shipper first. Their parabatai bond and friendship was just so touching with every page turned. I bawled over Jem and Will's love for each other more than I ever bawled over the romance between Jem and Tessa or Tessa and Will. Though it is true when people say that the love triangle in this series is like no other, I fiercely believe that Jem and Will's bond overpowers that of the romance in The Infernal Devices. I have not read a friendship as fierce and loyal as Jem and Will's. They made this series the masterpiece that it was. I'm glad everybody was able to have the happy ending that they all deserved, just as I had hoped for. My heart aches just knowing that this series is over! I'm afraid to continue on with the rest of The Mortal Instruments because I just don't think it will fill the void that The Infernal Devices has left. This series has truly became near and dear to my heart. ...more I finished the book in one breathe and Jem Jem Jem..you are my greatest Sin..mhan you have no right to steal my heart like that.

So ALL my family members will have to celebrate their birthdays first before I find out what happens to my dearest JEM... NNNNOOOOOOO!!!!! What a terrible thought!!!!! ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hhhmmm... Hold on... Why does it have a rating? It's not even out yet. How can you rate a book if you haven't even read it? DUH! It doesn't even have a cover so you can't rate that either. Weird... Freakin weird... I wonder what will happen. I'm glad that, FINALLY, the heroine chose the right guy. BECAUSE the bad guy always gets the girl. BECAUSE the bad guy is always the leading man. BECAUSE the bad guy is always the HOTTEST! Why does it work that way!? (Well, so sorry, but I have a soft spot for unwanted guys!) I have nothing against Will but for once, I just want the good guy to win. But I'm pretty sure that Tessa doesn't love Jem as much as she loves Will. And just thinking about that makes me want to come up to her, scream and say: \"WHAT THE HELL!? ARE YOU BLOODY SERIOUS!? ARE YOU FREAKIN BLIND!? JEM IS THE ONE!\" My heart breaks into a million pieces whenever I think of Jem's love for Tessa and Will's love for his parabatai Jem. I think Will's love for Jem is greater than his love for Tessa. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UGH!!! I need to read a different book to temporarily forget my yearning for The Infernal Devices. Can't you just release this first before The Mortal Instruments??? I love TMI but TID is so much better!

But also because I still don't have this book in my hands! Wait a minute... Is that the cover??? ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This review is definitely getting LOOOONNNNGGGEEERRRRR. Hey, where else can I vent out my frustration if the people around me are not into books? No matter how much I tell them, \"I AM SLOWLY DYING DAY BY DAY BECAUSE CASSIE CLARE DOESN'T WANT TO RELEASE CLOCKWORK PRINCESS THIS YEAR!!! MY ARTERIES ARE ON THE VERGE OF EXPLODING BECAUSE OF THE ANGUISH THAT I AM TRYING TO CONTROL!\", they would just say, \"What the heck are you talking about??? Get the fuck away from me you weirdo!\" DOUBLE FRUSTRATING! So these rumors that I've been reading about the release of this book are already facts??? 2013!!??? SERIOUSLY??? I'm about to get a heart attack any moment now... I definitely need a rune of patience. One anti-depressant rune would help too... ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Is that Tessa!? GOD SHE'S SO HOOOOOOT for her time! No wonder Will and Jem are going nuts! She's definitely prettier than Clary! (NO OFFENSE GIRL!) Is it just me or can you also see that this cover is a bit different from the first two books? I mean Tessa here looks REALISTIC. Will and Jem look like animation characters in their covers... ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I don\u2019t know what to say... Where do I start? I can\u2019t even compose myself and gather my thoughts together! But as forethought: Honestly, I don\u2019t know whether I should write in the past or present tense! Foreigner here! Help me out! God as an OC, I find it annoying that I don\u2019t know what tense I should use in writing reviews-slash-rants! I know reviews should be in present tense but rants and spoilers? Nevermind! Now writing at my own risk! You read at your own risk! :D (view spoiler) [ I still remember what I felt when I realized that Jem is going to die. It was like an ice pick was SLOWLY being thrust in my heart. The pain was sharp and unfathomable! Among all the book characters I\u2019ve come to like and hate, Jem is the only one I feel most inclined with. He is more than a favorite. It\u2019s actually indescribable. I can\u2019t find the words to express how much I love his character. So for someone who loves this character dearly, IT\u2019S HARD TO ACCEPT THAT HE\u2019S GOING TO PASS AWAY, PROBABLY BE FORGOTTEN, AND ONLY BE PRESENT IN MEMORIES! Did I cry? I think not (probably because I was reading in front of my loved ones!). The grief I felt was beyond tears. Honestly, I lost all my interest in finishing this book and the series itself. When put into actions, these are probably what I felt upon finishing Chapter 13, The Mind Has Mountains: [image error] After a few more pages, I stopped reading and gave up on finishing CP2, especially after finishing Chapter 14, Parabatai! But then the Lenten Season came and with it, a day without work to be done. I started to get bored and thought (REALLY HARD) of finally continuing where I left off. So in the end, I finished CP2\u2026 without feeling relieved! Should I be happy with the story? Honestly, I DON\u2019T KNOW! Why? Because no matter what others say, I firmly believe, with all my heart, that JEM LOST! He sacrificed EVERYTHING for Will and Tessa! Actually, he sacrificed MORE for WILL! How can a character be SO UTTERLY NICE!? I can\u2019t understand why!!! I SO want to punch my computer monitor at this very moment! Okay, I think I\u2019m perfectly calm now. And for the record, I did NOT punch my monitor, for I need it to finish this review-slash-rant. Jem\u2019s heart is so pure that he even decided to give his blessing and Tessa\u2019s hand to Will! Oh by the Angel! Tessa says he\u2019s not a martyr but HE IS! How can you let yourself slowly die of unending pain just to see your blood brother be happy!? Well, not that Will is without pain or anything\u2026 It\u2019s just that\u2026 OH! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO NICE MY BELOVED JEM!? Can I ever find a guy like My Jem? Anyway, even though he had to suffer more than Will had to (YES! Don\u2019t fight with me because Will bathed in light and Jem lived in total darkness, literally and figuratively!), I am still happy because he found his happiness in the end. He deserves it. But what he doesn\u2019t deserve is to be the SECOND. He clearly ought to have more, and coming in second and getting scraps (YES! I am talking about Tessa and her love) is not what I have in mind when I say MORE. I badly wanted Jem to win and not Will. But in the deepest part of my heart, I already knew that Will is going to win. It\u2019s how Cassandra Clare writes her stories \u2013 the good guy loses; the bad one wins. Anyway... What I am not happy about is the style of writing. What happened to the hopeless romantic characters? What ever happened to the sweet lines delivered by romantic people in the Victorian Era? While reading, all I could picture was American characters in American soil living in the present time. I think Cassandra Clare is too absorbed with finishing all her Shadowhunter series, (which to be honest, is already too many, though I must say I LOVE! So hooked to this Shadowhunter thingy!) that she does not notice that the quality of her works are diminishing. Even CoLS is not good! It\u2019s probably her worst book ever! I was expecting more from CP2. I was actually looking forward to the heartwarming lines between Jem and Tessa and Tessa and Will, but there was none. There was probably a few, but not as good as the lines in the first two books. Now what I LOVE about this book is the relationship of Will and Jem. Honestly, their more-than-brother-bond love for each other brought more tears to my eyes than the Will-Tessa-Jem love triangle. The Parabatai bond is really apparent in CP2. Readers are exposed to the ritual and what it really means to be bound under it. It\u2019s really more than being brothers. It\u2019s a brotherhood that can never be explained through words. When Will felt the Parabatai bond sever, I felt it as well. I felt everything Will and Jem went through without each other. Will is right, it\u2019s like losing a part of your heart. And every time I think about the bond they shared and somehow, but not totally, lost, I feel like someone is tearing my heart. This Parabatai thingy is something that Cassandra Clare should be proud of, I think. It\u2019s really a good concept. Give yourself a tap on your shoulder Cassie! :D Okay\u2026 Before finally saying goodbye to this series (I feel like weeping like a 5-year old!), I would really like to know what happened to Jem in the Silent City. I want to know how and who found his cure. WHAT is the cure? The Jem-and-Tessa relationship is not interesting anymore. We all know what would happen. It\u2019s just like what Will and Tessa had, only with Jem \u2013 too predictable. I am just concerned about James Carstairs\u2019 life. I hope I would find out in The Dark Artifices. Or is it possible to have even just ONE book about him and his life and journey as a Silent Brother? That I think is more interesting than the life of a normal Shadowhunter. Jem\u2019s character is really mysterious and special, and I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT!

I have nothing left - I have laughed, gasped, screeched, cried, sobbed, sobbed some more and then 'aww'd a little more after that. This is all too much. Cassie is a genius. When I retain my emotions - and am mentally stable once more - I will sit down and type up a scintillating review. :) Check out my reviews here **************** My 'before reading' review: Ok - I can see how the plot will roll out: - Will and Tessa 'i love you but I don't and let's have paragraphs describing our heart-tearing eye contact' tension - Jem and Tessa cute 'omg we're engaged but you're dying' stuff - Cecily 'i think i love Jem but shit he's engaged' thoughts - Sophie and Gideon 'we're in love and who cares about the others' moments - Gabriel 'God I'm such a loner' mini-chapters - Jessamine's 'wallowing in a cell without makeup' moments - Henry and Charlotte's 'we're having a baby!' times - Magnus' 'what the hell am I doing hanging around with the likes of all of you and ...ooh! Will's eyes are pretty' banter - The Magister's 'mwahahahahahahahahaha...ha...ha...I'm gonna kill you all' monologues It'll be good.

First, I'd like to say that although I am a HUGE fan of TMI and TID from the moment City of Ashes came out (because that's when I started), both of these series take two places of my top three favourite series. Okay, okay. Omg. No, I can't even begin to write about this book. I absolutely love Miss Clare. So much feelings. This book was amazing, just like the previous two books. And the last two chapters OMFG. I love how the whole thing was connected. And of course, since I waited A WHOLE FREAKIN YEAR for this book, I couldn't remember every character so I was rushing and thinking a lot everytime a character popped up, I was like OMG THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED, or OMG, THAT'S HER GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDMOTHER. I was so happy she ended up with Will. But there was definitely not enough Will/Tessa for me. And then Jem left but came back. Whaaaat! IDLKFJDSG But then he turned back into human in the end. Which I don't completeeeely understand. But I'm so happy Tessa gets both. Probably the only happy love triangle. Where everyone is happy. And I hope Tessa actually legit has a family reunion with Jace. Or maybe she does in City of Lost Souls. I haven't finished that book yet. LOL, awkward. I'm satisfied with the ending. I want more, but I know it may be asking to much and you know how some series should just stop. MORE? YES? NO? YES... NO... YES... I hope this is made into a movie as well, along with TMI which I am suuuper excited for! Sad that Pettyfer wasn't casted as Jace, so Mr. Bower, you better fulfill this role. I think there's only one series that's over 3/4 books in the series that I actually love all the way, which is Vampire Academy. (RECOMMENDED) Otherwise it turns out like the House of Night. (ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED) (hide spoiler) ] Okay, I don't really know what I'm writing anymore, it's kind of trailing off. LOLwut. I love Cassie Clare and her books. Anyone know if there's a full family tree somewhere? Link me? Or something. LOL, SIDESTORY, okay, and then I didn't realise there was a family tree in the back of the book until I was on page 360-something AND I WISH I HADN'T. Because I cannot resist temptation. I spoiled it for myself. Just. Love TMI. Love TID. Love Jace/Clary. Love Will/Tessa. Love Cassie Clare. Love this book. Love love love. Okay, now I'm going to cry because TID is over.

PLEASE with a cherry on top, sprinkles, chocolate chips, and crushed peanut butter cups! Heck, I'll even add some FREAKIN HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE! How can you RESIST hot chocolate sauce?! PERSON WHO WROTE THIS LETTER: *runs around like a maniac* *screams in agony* *throws cup of tea on wall* CLOCKWORK PRINCESS, I love you. I really, really do. I love you so much. So, please, please come out earlier. I'll love you for eternity. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEE!? *sobs*. Love, Me. *UPDATE* Cassandra Clare said that the rumors saying that the book will be released in 2013 (le gasp!) are TRUE. ME: YOU HAVE THE BE FREAKING KIDDING ME. Dammit. By the angel, I just realized that if the world will indeed end in 2012, I will never read this book. Ever. No. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I MUST find out who Tessa will end up with. I must. NO. NO. NO. NOOOOOOOOOO! Cassandra, I know I haven't been a very good girl because I've been thinking about Will in ways I shouldn't lately and I've been really... odd in my letters above but PLEASE don't do this to me! I will go throw something now, and I will be back. If I don't read someone saying that it will be released earlier, I will throw something else. And that's very dangerous. So I suggest you release it early so no one will get hurt. *blink* *sobs* UPDATE: AH! I finally finished! I CAN'T BELIEVE TID IS OVER! I cried forever when I finally realized it! CASSANDRA CLARE: I LOVE AND DESPISE YOU AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY SOUL. ...more Well... it's finally happened. I've finally finished The Infernal Devices! Clockwork Princess was a solid finale to this series. The characters are each unique and enjoyable in their own way, and I LOVE the Victorian atmosphere. And yes, as everyone warned me they would, the feels did hit me at the end... although it wasn't quite as intense as I'd expected (I'm sorry, don't kill me!) **SPOILERY** I do wish that there had been a bit more focus on the plot with Mortmain and his Infernal Devices and Well... it's finally happened.

And yes, as everyone warned me they would, the feels did hit me at the end... although it wasn't quite as intense as I'd expected (I'm sorry, don't kill me!) **SPOILERY** I do wish that there had been a bit more focus on the plot with Mortmain and his Infernal Devices and less on the love triangle. Also, I never really liked the idea of Tessa and Jem together. Jem never seemed right for her, and I never BELIEVED that she loved him as much as Will. Therefore, I found it a bit annoying at times when the book just went on and on about how Tessa loves BOTH Jem and Will, and she will always love BOTH of them because they're each perfect and beautiful and they each love HER so much and they're one-and-the-same because parabatai and on and on and on. It got a bit tiring. And finally, the end got me very excited to read the rest of TMI with all the little teasers there. I'm especially interested to know what's to become of that AWESOME sword that Will refused to take from Jem's uncle. Also, I hope Jem and Tessa make appearances in the last three TMI books! Or maybe they already have in the first three, and I've just forgotten... Dangit! Guess I'll have to go back and read them again XD More details in a future wrap-up video. ...more 4.5 stars. Ok, fine \u2014 everyone\u2019s right. This book was pretty great. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of Cassandra Clare\u2019s other works (I mean, they\u2019re fine... they're just not favorites), but this story was all sorts of emotional. The love triangle worked so much better in this book than the last one. A million times better. I love Jem and Will\u2019s bond SO much.

Tessa was never the strongest character for me, but I liked her enough! I actually liked all of the other characters in this book too and was decently into the whole story. So I\u2019m mostly just excited that I finally got into one of these books people keep raving about! But I still feel like the writing occasionally has a lot of\u2026 filler? Like the pacing just gets bogged down with unnecessary stuff that doesn\u2019t add anything sometimes. And I really wasn\u2019t into the consul stuff with Charlotte or any of the actual plot with Mortmain. And all of the actual storyline with the infernal devices felt like some weak background chatter. Luckily the relationships (and friendships) were strong enough to carry the whole book. Ok one more complaint: the plot did a great job of building these complicated relationships and I realllly didn't think the (view spoiler) [whole cave sex scene RIGHT after Jem died was the strongest direction for the story or characters. (And P.S. what's up with all of Cassandra Clare's characters going at it in caves...) (hide spoiler) ] . Like I get that the story has Shadowhunters not adhere to social customs of that time period as much, buuuut it was still an odd choice. It killed the other emotions and felt really out of character. And I\u2019m not sure how I felt about the epilogue, but I think I liked it? It kind of felt like a cheap way out, BUT also made me happy at the same time. This series is so much better than The Mortal Instruments, though! Definitely read this before TMI. I think I would have been waaaay more into these books if I hadn\u2019t pushed through 6 books of Jace & Clary first. WAAAAIT I FORGOT TO GUSH OVER WALES! All of the Welsh legends and language! The setting was easily one of the best parts of the book. I just really like Wales\u2026 the whole time period, steampunk feel, and London/Wales setting of this book might be the cause of at least half of these stars. ...more AHHHHH. I FINISHED READING IT.

It was all so overwhelming, at points the story would get so morbid and i would be like you need to chill you're hinting at things i'm not emotionally prepared for. OH OH OH and THEN, My ruination commenced. Girl i was bawling like a baby in need of affection. There were other times when i was just frustrated that i threw the book in the time out corner. Seriously these characters can get very frustrating. But some characters got what they did. Joel was all over that YASS BOY TALK SHIT SOME MORE. OH WAIT YOU CAN'T ANYMORE HAHAH but then BAM someone cares about would get hurt and i'd shut up start crying again. ALSO WHAT IS WITH THE NICKNAMES. \"Tessie\", \"Cecy\" i'm sorry what. Fam you sound like you're talking to your pet chihuhua. Chihuhuas aren't cute what r u doing like are you a stop sign because STOP. Obviously i had no chill when it came to putting some of these characters in their place. If only they could actually hear me. Too bad they're fictional. Anyway, i have got to say this was a million times better than TMI and the hype for Lady Midnight is VERY real. Boy wait until i get my hands on it. I'm going to be all over the place screaming like a dying alpacha. P.S this was probably one of the most satisfying conclusion to a trilogy I've ever read. Joel approves. now excuse me while i treat myself to some delicious taco bell chalupas. ...more I can dislike Cassandra Clare, her MORTAL INSTRUMENTS series, and what she's done for however long I'd like, but that doesn't mean I don't absolutely adore this series. I won't feel ashamed for loving THE INFERNAL DEVICES. I refuse. This is one of my favorite series, and nothing will change that. I read CLOCKWORK PRINCESS very slowly. I don't know why; perhaps it was because I didn't want to finish it, maybe it was because I was in a reading slump, or more likely: I just wasn't interested.

I don't know why; perhaps it was because I didn't want to finish it, maybe it was because I was in a reading slump, or more likely: I just wasn't interested. It took over a month of staring at the book, picking it up, and putting it back down before I forced myself to open it up, for real this time, and start over. And once I was sucked in, that was the end. I stayed up late at night reading; I skipped the first few minutes of class to hide in corner of the bathroom and finish the chapter; I stopped watching GAME OF THRONES for a few days just so I could reach the end. The day I finished was one of the most miserable days in my existence. It wasn't just the book, though that contributed for sure. I pushed a chair against my door, and curling up in my bed, threw the covers over my head and began to cry. I sobbed and sniffled pathetically for at least an hour, and then I took a shower and went to bed at nine. I had a horrible nightmare and woke up sweating. CLOCKWORK ANGEL has a special place in my heart, because it was one of the first books I ever 'reviewed' when I joined the blogosphere. I fell in love with the characters, and the story, and the writing when it wasn't riddled with hundreds of similes and metaphors. I was fearful that CLOCKWORK PRINCESS would disappoint me and cause me unnecessary stress and sadness. It didn't disappoint me, not at all, but it sure devastated me. CLOCKWORK PRINCESS wraps up the whole series lovingly and grievingly, sparing none of your emotions and crushing your heart. The conclusion will leave some thrilled and others crying uncontrollably. I, unfortunately, was in the latter group. Every character was so carefully detailed and crafted. It was hard for me not to love them all I failed at not adoring them, sorry , and it was harder for me not to scream and pull my hair out when bad things happened to them. They were so real, and that will always be Clare's strongest point in writing. They're so realistic; they act like assholes and they make mistakes and they go through the same pain that real people do. I'd always enjoyed reading about Tessa; she was likable if a little dull, and she developed so much in this book. Looking back at the first book, the difference between past Tessa and current Tessa is unbelievable. Same with Will: I hated him with a burning passion at first. You, Will, were hysterical... By CLOCKWORK PRINCESS, he was nearly unrecognizable. His horrible, prickly exterior had been stripped off, and beneath was a stunningly insecure soul who just needed love. He was still hilariously snarky at times, but it wasn't meant to degrade anyone. Jem Carstairs has been my favorite literary character of all time since I read CLOCKWORK ANGEL a few years back. His undying sweetness, kindness, and loyalty to Will melted my heart the very first page he was introduced. CLOCKWORK PRINCESS revolves around Jem's illness and the countdown to his death, and that was probably the main reason CLOCKWORK PRINCESS hit me so hard. Jem and Will have this love for each other that even Tessa will never be able to interfere with. It's so beautiful and strong and unbreakable. I honestly spent most of my time holding back tears every time they were together. There was so much angst in CLOCKWORK PRINCESS, and the love triangle was so damn... well, angsty . I was shipping Jill (Jem and Will) by page thirty, and all I wanted them to do was to say FUCK TESSA and elope and adopt beautiful children. Who cares if parabati can't have relationships? Besides being a Jill shipper, I'm also a Wessa shipper but a bigger Jessa shipper, so I was really quite hoping they'd have a threesome and just end it there. Obviously, it didn't happen in that exact order that didn't happen. Jem and Tessa have such a beautiful, lasting, strong bond. It's impossible to sever and only gets stronger with time. But Will and Tessa's love is bright and explosive omg I want to say TACO BELL but that's not appropriate and passionate. Tessa is in love with them both, and yes, I think it's possible. It's like someone asking, \"what's your favorite book?\" I'm betting over seventy percent of bloggers and readers can't answer that, because they love so many . Tessa has two favorites, because she's a lucky bitch and lucky bitches get what they want. The love triangle ended in a way that I was half pleased with and half distressed over. If you're a Jill shipper, you'll cry. If you're a Jessa shipper, you'll cry. If you're a Wessa shipper, you'll cry. If you're a Wemssa shipper, you will definitely cry. Either way, you're fucked. I've always admired Clare for the way she manages to intertwine THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS with THE INFERNAL DEVICES. All the family trees are kept straight and correct unlike the Warriors series, where Rowanclaw apparently undergoes an operation to turn into a male , and various questions that have appeared in her MORTAL INSTRUMENTS series are answered here. Though, I would love to see her try to manage the family tree with four possible Shadowhunter series. *snorts* I feel as if Clare saw all the angry status updates a lot of bloggers including me were posting up about the SHEER AMOUNT OF SIMILES AND METAPHORS IN THESE GODDAMN BOOKS. Pages and pages of her MORTAL INSTRUMENTS series could've been cut if she had calmed the fuck down with the purple writing. CLOCKWORK PRINCESS shows a growth and maturity in the writing style that I never thought Clare could handle. Now, CLOCKWORK PRINCESS is not without its faults. Several parts of it annoyed and frustrated me beyond understanding, such as when (view spoiler) [WILL AND TESSA BANG EACH OTHER RIGHT AFTER HE TELLS HER JEM IS DEAD I MEAN WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK (hide spoiler) ] . And, of course, that ending. (view spoiler) [I'm all for realistic endings, but Will's death scene was heart-wrenching, and I'm afraid that Jem will also grow old and die, leaving Tessa completely alone this time. I'm so happy they got together after Will died, even if it was decades, but still. The epilogue takes place in 2008, so I'm praying to the Book Gods that they'll see Magnus again in THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS series, who's hopefully looking for something to make Alec immortal as well, so EVERYONE WINS.

If they both really loved Jem, no matter how much they loved each other, they could've held off until they were out of crazy Mortmain's Welsh mountainside lair! (hide spoiler) ] Overall, listening to these books on audiobook is A++. They are really easy to follow, well-narrated and engaging. Plus, all the emotions between the characters was expressed really well and made their interactions great to listen to. I also have to commend Clare for how many great relationship dynamics are in this book, and not just romantic ones. We've got best guy friends, guy/girl friendships, marriages, brother/brother, sister/brother, girl/girl friendships, and probably more that I'm forgetting. And the epilogue. Let's talk about the epilogue for a quick sec. As much as I was all for what happened there, it did seem convenient and a bit like fan service. I honestly would've been happy with things turning out *not* as perfectly as they did because I felt like the whole story was basically a moot point after that. I'm torn between enjoying how she tied everything together, especially with The Mortal Instruments , and being kind of annoyed that you have to read all her books to get the full enjoyment out of it. Nevertheless, I will continue to read Cassandra Clare's stories because they are addictive and quite satisfying, and now I know I really like them on audio. ...more SPOILER ALERT xxx SERIOUSLY, DON'T READ IF YOU PLAN ON READING THE BOOK Oh god!

Clockwork Princess is like one of those highly dramatic and nasty soap operas meant to reduce your IQ level: characters randomly come back to life, basic laws of nature are challenged, and anything happens so long as the main characters have their happy ending. I mean seriously, this book has the authority on sickly sweet happy endings. Clare, in this book has managed to pair off every single character in it: Sophie gets engaged to Gideon, then there is Will's sister (cant remember her name) and Gabriel, Charlotte was always married to Henry (who almost dies but finally survives so that the Happy Ending isn't compromised), and my personal favorite: Tessa (who's immortal) and Will (who ages and is therefore forced to grow old while his wife remains young and youthful forever) and eventually modern day Tessa (immortal still) and modern day Jem (who is still alive because before he could die he became a Silent Brother and then finally decides to give up that life style so as to maintain the Happy Ending). At one point I felt like I was reading from a match making site. I really think authors these days need to become more spunky and learn to kill off one or two of their less important characters. J.K. Rowling killed a million, and she is still one of the most renowned authors of all time! So if Clare had killed say Sophie or Henry or Gideon or even Jem, I think it would have made the book a lot more appreciable and a lot less pathetic. How I think the book should have ended: Jem should have died, there is no point in stretching his life. Tessa should have drunk some magical potion to make her mortal, or Will should have turned into a vampire. Yes, I think that makes sense- Will should have been turned into a vamp so that he can live forever with his wife. Needless to say, this should have happened after Tessa had already given birth to atleast three or five kids, so that they could have their happy ending with a nice big family. See now, we still have a honey sweet happy ending, and a more sensible one at that! Ah, I think I should end my whine rant now. This is anyways the very last book written by Cassandra Clare I ever plan on reading, since I gave up on the Mortal Instruments series after that horrid fourth book. I really wonder whether the first three books of that series were actually well written, or I was just an airhead when I read them and therefore liked them... Since I don't plan on re-reading, I guess I'll never know... ...more \"I knew you thought there to be some corruptive force about you that would break me.

THAT is the beauty of this love story. I didn't think I was going to cry like that, but it happened. I am on the side of the fans who were happy with the epilogue. The way everything came full circle was perfect. It drove the point home of how everybody and everything in this story (and in a sense the greater world of shadowhunters) was intertwined. We knew that there would be some joy and some heartache because there was no way to end this story perfectly. As readers, we were given enough joy to balance the heartache. The author chose an ending which worked on so many levels without feeling like a copout. A friend of mine made a great point about why this trilogy ending was still not the easiest solution. A copout would have been (view spoiler) [to find a way to make one of the guys immortal so Tess would not have to ever be alone. (hide spoiler) ] There is nothing more that I want to say.
