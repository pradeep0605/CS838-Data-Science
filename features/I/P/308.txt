I don't think the book was horrible, but it couldn't hold my attention too long so I was happy it was very short. If it was any longer I probably wouldn't have finished it. I couldn't stand Colin. He was annoying and whiny and just because he acknowledges that fact himself doesn't mean it makes it any less annoying to read about. His friend Hassan was alright. I didn't mind him and I thought he had some funny parts, but most of the humor with him was about his fatness and man boobs. That's not exactly my kind of humor, but I'm sure there are other people who love that kinda stuff. Lindsey wasn't that interesting either. She wasn't annoying like Colin, but I just found myself thinking they would hook up and that's it. To me this book was just bland. It didn't have any good twists or an engaging plot. Usually I feel lots of emotions when reading one of John's books, but with this one I felt nothing but boredom. He does include his signature road trip where the character learns some lessons about life, but getting that far was a struggle for me. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who wants to try John Green, because I rate this so much lower than all of his other books. The writing style and formula is present, but it's just not as good. ...more ____________________________________________ \u201cBooks are the ultimate Dumpees: put them down and they\u2019ll wait for you forever; pay attention to them and they always love you back.\u201d ____________________________________________ 2 DISAPPOINTING STARS!

So, why am I reading this? I have been programmed to only care about supernatural cute boys. I call this my mid life crisis. If I give in and self analyze, I would say that I\u2019m avoiding real life. I\u2019m letting myself get caught up in situations that I would have daydreamed about at maybe age 12. Being the \u2018damsel in distress\u2019, being unconditionally loved for qualities that I have not yet discovered in myself. Feeling safe, always protected by really cute guys\u2026 the bad guys always get caught, and everyone lives happily ever after. What I\u2019m avoiding is that memory of that\u2026 drive\u2026 that happens somewhere around age 16... Where you feel like you have the ability to change the world. That you will go off and do amazing things and that your whole life is waiting for you. It\u2019s a rush. I remember sitting in the Boston Commons on summer night in 1988, I was 17, freshly graduated waiting to start college\u2026 we had just moved into an apartment in East Boston and Jimmy Cliff was playing a concert in the park. I didn\u2019t have to tell anyone where I was going or when I would be back. I remember sitting on this hill, staring at the sky through the trees, listening to that reggae beat and thinking \u2018I am free. I am young and I can do anything.\u2019 THAT is what I\u2019m running from. So, when I finished AAOK , I almost resented Green for reminding me of that. Then, I had this selfless epiphany. This is not for me. This was written for that generation. Those kids that are getting ready to change the world. They want to \u2018matter\u2019, they want to be remembered. I really envy them. Not in that self piteous way\u2026 just in that youthful energetic way. I get this way each fall when I watch the kids slumping off to UVM. They look so hopeful and serious. Why does that have to fade? This is a road trip book. I\u2019ve seen it listed as such. I would expand on that \u2018road trip\u2019 theme and make it not just a literal one. Colin wants to get away from being the dumpee of all girls named Katherine. But, it\u2019s than that. Colin has always been considered a \u2018child prodigy\u2019 and he\u2019s thinking that maybe that isn\u2019t enough to \u2018matter\u2019 or to make a mark on the world. After all, a prodigy isn\u2019t a genius\u2026 A prodigy regurgitates. A genius creates. Colin\u2019s road trip is much more mental than led on. I like that Colin doesn\u2019t sparkle or have telling scars. I picture him as a cooler Napoleon Dynamite. He has a sidekick. A pudgy Horatio. He has a talent for anagramming. And he likes math. Okay, I was all for it except for the math part. Ugh. I admit, I skimmed a lot of the theorems and graphs and algebraic equations. Lost me there. But, anagramming\u2026 swoon I am an anagramming nerd. (Regard naming man, Drain Merman Gang, Ragged Man Arm Inn) Colin and his Horatio, Hassan, end up leaving Chicago and turning up in Gutshot, Tennessee. THAT is a horror story --\u2018dead end\u2019 turn-- of events. I went all Ned Beatty and shuddered and almost stopped reading. But, I\u2019m learning to fight my biases\u2026 it\u2019s one of those mid life crisis goals. The south is NOT scary\u2026 not always. (Gutshot? Really? That was hard to swallow, I\u2019m sure there are towns named that and all, but I\u2019m taking baby steps here) Colin has many Eureka moments in Gutshot and each one makes me love him more. He\u2019s a sweet kid who just wants to be loved, to not be left behind. Who can fault that? Colin quotes Democritus \u201cEverywhere man blames nature and fate, yet his fate is mostly but the echo of his character and passions, his mistakes and weaknesses.\u201d What a great quote to pass on to Generation Z or whatever they are now. I wish that I had that when I was young. I might not have set myself up for failure\u2026 I hope that these kids carry this with them because I feel a kinship with them. I was a Reagan kid, they are Bush 34 kids\u2026 we know\u2026 This book really does give hope if not understanding the need for hope. (if that makes sense) I hear that there is a movie in the works. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll pretty up Colin and make him seem quirky and all that, but I hope that they delve into that next level and give props to that insecurity, because that\u2019s what we need. To see that it\u2019s okay if you only matter to yourself. Ned Vizzini\u2019s It's Kind of a Funny Story had that same sort of message and I am saddened that that movie didn\u2019t do well, that teens care more about zombies or jackasses. My next Eureka moment: to pass this lesson on to my kids. Post Script: Oh, and I want to mention that there are footnotes in this book. And it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s more like the DFW type footnotes where you feel like you have an extra character that you can turn to and say \u2018I know, right?\u2019\u2026 It\u2019s all good. ...more As a YA author, I'd heard the name \"John Green\" whispered in the YA wind for months, but I'd never picked up one of his books until I read a synopsis for AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES online.

Even with flashbacks, the pacing never flagged, and though it wasn't the world's most unpredictable plot, I was never bored. The real charm in this book is both the characters -- larger than life, quirky people who don't quite fit into society -- and the dialog. In John Green's hands, dialog is a weapon . . . and he slayed me. I'm thrilled that he has a two other novels and a recent anthology for me to work through next. ***wondering why all my reviews are five stars?

Suddenly, you're a teenager with no claim to fame except for your former status as a prodigy. No new ideas. No girl. No plans for the summer excepting wasting away in your room and moping. This is not your life. But it is Colin Singleton's life immediately after his graduation from high school. Given Colin's history with girls, you might not be surprised that John Green chose to name his second novel <+++>An Abundance of Katherines</+++>. After sulking for several days after being dumped (again), Colin is dragged out of his room by Hasan, his best friend. Hassan is confident that the only cure for Colin's depression is a road trip. So Colin and his Judge-Judy-loving, overweight, Muslim pal head off for the great beyond that is the United States between the coasts. Their road trip stops in Gutshot, Tennessee. But the adventures don't. Hired by a local bigwig to compile an oral history of Gutshot, Colin and Hassan find themselves staying with Hollis and her daughter, Lindsey. It is in Gutshot that Colin finally has what he has always wanted, a truly original idea. Thus, Colin begins to create a theorem of love in his attempt to understand his own rocky love life. Most of my friends who have read this book and Green's first novel Looking for Alaska agree that his second novel is not as compelling a read. Having only read \"Katherines,\" I cannot make a judgment one way or the other. What I can say is that I loved the style of this book. There has been a growing trend to use footnotes in novels--notable examples include The Bartimaeus Trilogy by Johnathan Stroud, Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next novels, and Ibid A Life by Mark Dunn which is a novel written entirely of endnotes. Green continues that tradition here to good effect. The tone throughout is quirky, nerdy, and generally fun. I don't know that reading this novel will change any lives, but it will certainly get a lot of laughs. The best parts are, undoubtedly, the dialogues between Hassan and Colin. The guys are just so likable! In addition, Green's writing is snappy--all the better to keep the laughs coming. Like Nothing but the Truth by Justina Chen Headley, this book includes a bit of math. The \"real\" math behind Colin's theorem appears in the back of the book in an appendix and Green even has a website where you can use the theorem for your own relationships (if it doesn't crash your computer). Despite all of that, Green is a self-proclaimed lost cause when it comes to math. (The theorem was drafted by friend (and \"resident mathematician\" for Brotherhood 2.0), Daniel Biss.) I wanted to share this for a couple of reasons. First, because I think it's great that Green is writing outside of what some might call his \"comfort zone\" and, second, because it should illustrate that you don't have to like math to enjoy a book that features a lot of math. Anyway, if you need a cheerful book with some fun, lovable characters I don't think you can do better than this book which was recently nominated for the LA Times Book Award in addition to being selected as a Printz Award honor book (Looking for Alaska won the actual Printz Award, just to put that into perspective). ...more Un libro sin nada que contar, nada original y que carece de trama.

Tenemos a Hassan, el mejor amigo de Colin, que aunque es UN intento de incluir algo diferente e intentar normalizarlo (es musulm\u00e1n), se convierte en un personaje que vuelve a ser un plagio del resto de personajes secundarios de John Green y adem\u00e1s se convierte en un clich\u00e9 gigante, utilizando su cultura y religi\u00f3n para hacer la inmensa mayor\u00eda de sus chistes. \u00a1Genial, John Green, te ha salido el tiro por la culata! Y luego Lindsey, una chica tambi\u00e9n popular, buenorr\u00edsima y que de verdad, \u00a1oh, vaya!, tambi\u00e9n resulta ser una cerebrito superparecida a Colin. No, no es predecible. Para nada.

Me da pena que El teorema Katherine sea tan mala, porque John Green es un autor que en el fondo me gusta, pero creo que esta novela no se sostiene por ning\u00fan lado. La trama no es clara (si es que podemos encontrarla), el hecho de incluir el teorema es absurdo porque no contribuye en nada, ni a los personajes ni a la historia, y en general, no hay nada que contar. No hay una moraleja, no hay giros en la trama. Es lineal, completamente lineal, sin evoluci\u00f3n de los personajes. Predecible. Aburrida.

I read Green's Looking For Alaska and thought it was one of the best young adult novels I have ever read SO I was expecting this book to measure up to a higher standard. Unfortunately, it did not even come close. Here's my beef with the book: 1) The characters. I had a really hard time getting into Katherines because the characters were not too likable. Green gave the characters personalities, but he missed something in the character development category that could have made his characters people that readers (especially young adults) could relate to. 2) The basic premise of the book did not appeal to me. I never bought into the 19-girlfriends-named-Katherine bit and struggled to understand why the main character spent the entire novel trying to devise a mathematical formula that would explain why he was dumped so often by his girlfriends. It all just seemed a bit OCD and irrational to me, and it almost felt like he was trying too hard to come up with a unique idea for his sophomore novel. 3) I was disappointed because I found huge chunks of the book to be pretty boring. Many of the conversations were dull and I found myself skimming a lot of the text. I skimmed because I kept thinking the book would make a turnaround but I think most young adult readers would probably give up. I think the footnotes and references made it worse but it just seemed to me like a lot of what happened could have been said in a simpler and faster way. My last concern is that I am not sure who this text is really for. Middle school kids probably would not \"get\" the main message because of the higher level vocabulary and I think those obscure references/footnotes make the book seem even more difficult than it is. I wish this book was more like Looking For Alaska because that was truly a fantastic read but hopefully his future writing will sort of return to that simple but beautiful type of expression. Katherines isn't horrible but I definitely would not go out of my way to recommend it and would suggest that you read Looking For Alaska instead. ...more Had I been reading this on paper instead of my computer, it probably would have gone into the fireplace here: \"She was incredibly hot--in that popular-girl-with-bleached-teeth-and-anorexia kind of way, which was Colin's least favorite way of being hot.\" And if somehow it had survived that initial immolation, I definitely would have shredded it for birdcage fodder (and I don't even own a bird!) here: \"She looked prettier than she ever had before--Colin always preferred girls without makeup.\" This Had I been reading this on paper instead of my computer, it probably would have gone into the fireplace here: \"She was incredibly hot--in that popular-girl-with-bleached-teeth-and-anorexia kind of way, which was Colin's least favorite way of being hot.\" And if somehow it had survived that initial immolation, I definitely would have shredded it for birdcage fodder (and I don't even own a bird!) here: \"She looked prettier than she ever had before--Colin always preferred girls without makeup.\" This book was everything I don't like about John Green. And I've already spent enough of my one precious life complaining about how his books are the literary embodiment of high school boys being unsuccessful in love and the general social hierarchy and then constructing an impossibly unpleasant wall of moral superiority as some sort of retroactive explanation for why no one likes them (they're all stupid and superficial anyway and I'm ABOVE all of that) when really maybe they're just obnoxious or plain unlucky and they can't seem to realize that - etc etc to want to spend much more time on it. Basically this is the platonic ideal of John Green books. His books teach bad lessons to fragile kids and turn them into insufferable judgmental douchebags. So Colin, maybe all those Katherines dumped you because you're kind of an asshole. Where's the variable for that? ...more So this was my first John Green book.

On to the story: we have a prodigy who has just graduated high school, was dumped, and makes his way on a road trip accompanied by his best friend. Our MC, Colin is struggling with two things: understanding his recent breakup and wanting to matter in the world. Being a prodigy ( not a genius!) he believes that he can create a formula that will be able to predict how long any given relationship will last by inputting certain factors. It\u2019s this single-minded focus that blinds and consumes him. He becomes frustrated when all but one of his relationships fit into the formula. Until he discovers that his recollection of that one relationship was all wrong. Soon he starts to realize that maybe he had been looking at all of them in that same way. What resonated most with me about this story wasn\u2019t the fact that Colin bemoaned his previous romances, but the fact that he wanted to matter ; he wanted to contribute something to this world. He was a child prodigy and he plateaued and was now faced with living a mundane adulthood. I just wanted to say, \u201cBruh, I feel you on that. You have no idea .\u201d And I think a lot of people who were once bright children, full of promise and possibility, will relate to Colin\u2019s existential dilemma and the anxiety that comes with facing an ordinary life after an extraordinary childhood. Here we have a character about to enter college, on the precipice of entering the real world, knowing that the good years are behind him; he peaked too soon and now everything is a slow downhill crawl towards death. But there\u2019s hope in Colin\u2019s story. He breaks the cycle of only dating Katherines and hooks up with the hot chick like the end of a John Hughes film. Maybe the future isn\u2019t so bleak for him after all. ...more There's so much John Green-ness in this book, I love it :) 1. Love the footnotes 2. Love Hassan 3. Love dialogue 4. Love the story Fuggin right. Check out my video review! A reenactment of the moment <+++>An Abundance of Katherines</+++> was conceived: John Green sat at his desk, quietly contemplating the ghettoization of scrambled eggs as a breakfast food and brainstorming ideas for his new book. His last novel, Looking for Alaska , had done moderately well, but he wanted to do something different this time. Something to show his critics that he wasn't a one-trick pony yet out-of-there enough to show his nerdfighters that he was one of them. An outsider, a man of the people.

Something to show his critics that he wasn't a one-trick pony yet out-of-there enough to show his nerdfighters that he was one of them. An outsider, a man of the people. His eyes drifted to a map taped on the wall, then to an unfinished Scrabble game from last night. His brother Hank had been kicking his butt, but had to leave to mediate on the metaphysics of ice-cream trucks before he could finish spelling 'hamartia' (luckily). As he was idly staring at his unused letters, it hit him. \"Eureka!\" he yelled, glasses sliding down his nose in his excitement. \"That's it! I'll write a book about anagrams! That's nerdy and chic, and in no way like my last protagonist's obsession with famous last words.\" John picked up the letters, rearranging them in his head: 'Hem, arrow, hero. Yes, hero! He needed a protagonist. Preferably one like himself. White male, middle-class range, intelligent, quirky... but as an extra twist, his quirkiness would be the result of autism. Mild autism. Nothing too heavy. Fans won't be able to relate to him! Also, research is hard. I'd rather philosophize on Venn diagrams of octopi and dogs.' Putting the letters down, he paced the floor, dialogue and plot points bombarding his head like unformed constellations. 'My protagonist should have a best friend like Colonel. Quirky enough to get his jokes, but won't overshadow the main character, which is in no way like me. Let's make him an Arab, too. That takes care of the diversity problem. And a love interest! Gorgeous and quirky. Oh, and she should exist to teach my main character an important lesson. Yay, feminism points! But how do I get them to meet?\" His gaze landed on the map again. 'A road trip! That's not like Pudge and Colonel's emotional journey to find Alaska at all!' John laughed, clapped his hands together and sat down in front of his laptop. Then he began to write. 'John, my man, I don't know how you think of this stuff.' ...more 2.5 Here are some things I\u2019ve realized after reading AAoK : 1.

AAoK has a nerdy, heartbroken hero (irritating), some cussing in Arabic (gets taxing after a while), jokes about man-boobs and fractured balls (not really my idea of humor), a lot of math (scary) that strangely looks interesting (I wouldn\u2019t know for sure since I skipped those parts). Colin really got on my nerves. Whining and theorem-making are not exactly things I\u2019m fond of, and that\u2019s all Colin does (in addition to spewing out random facts). I wish the narration was in first-person; it would have made things more interesting. The footnotes were a relief. I loved them \u2013 even the ones that had math. In fact, they were my sole motivation for trudging through the pages. This was my first John Green novel and well... I\u2019m not terribly impressed. I hope TFioS and Looking for Alaska fare better. I\u2019ll leave you with one of those rare lines that actually made me laugh: \u201cHe tried not to sob much, because the plain fact of the matter is that boy-sobbing is exceedingly unattractive. Lindsey said, \u201cLet it out, let it out,\u201d and then Colin said, \u201cBut I can\u2019t, because if I let it out it\u2019ll sound like a bullfrog\u2019s mating call.\u201d \u201d ...more I've had this book sitting on my desk for two months.

It took me three months to get a copy of An Abundance of Katherines. It took me two months to finish it. Actually, that's a lie. I haven't finished AAoK. I'll probably never finish AAoK. But for the purpose of this review, I've read the entire novel and wasn't satisfied in the least. Everyone knows that John Green uses a formula. Like Sarah Dessen, most of his protagonists are the same character with different hobbies and quirks. Colin is Miles and Miles is Quentin -- only Colin likes anagramming words instead of memorizing last words. Colin, like Miles, is annoying. He only exists for the story to be funneled through him. John Green's protagonists are a beacon of hope for nerds everywhere in the world. While you may be unable to get a date with that hot, unattainable girl, Colin, Miles, and Quentin have dated enough hot girls to last you a lifetime -- or at least until John Green writes another book. His books are full of double standards. Like Kody Keplinger, author of The DUFF , John Green claims to present something alternative. This is a lie. The only thing that separates this from any other YA book is that our main character doesn't go through a make-over. Instead, he is accepted by the flawless pretty heroine for no reason whatsoever Why can't Lindsey or Margo or Alaska be anything less than gorgeous? Why can't they have goals outside of being with the protagonist? I like Looking for Alaska , but I think it's important to analyze these things. As a hero, Colin fails. Not only was I disappointed with the 3rd person narration, but I also felt like Colin lacked a soul. He wasn't a full developed character. He was a collection of quirks. I felt the same way about Miles, but at least his flaws were hidden by a cast of interesting characters. As a supporting character, Hassan failed in every way that Takumi and the Colonel triumphed. Takumi didn't feel like the token Asian. Hassan was without a doubt the token Arab. Hassan wasn't funny. He lacked warmth. He was just there to make bad jokes. His use of random Arabic or German was annoying. Every time he said 'kafir' or 'sitzpinkler' I rolled my eyes. Have we really gone back to the time when Mexican characters dropped random bits of Spanish into their sentences? Also, I didn't appreciate how his weight was used as a plot device. No, I'm not misusing that phrase. Hassan was fat for the same reason that all multi-cultural best friends are geeky, over-weight, and unappealing. It was very obvious that Green was writing for white hipster males. As a love interest, Lindsey just wasn't interesting. She paled in comparison to Alaska. A manic pixie must be manic, intriguing, and flawed. Lindsey wasn't. By the time she was finally introduced, I was hoping that Colin would get back with Katherine the Great. At least he would have stopped whining. The romance between Colin and Lindsey was yawn worthy. Even from the flashbacks, whatever Colin had with Katherine the Great moved me ten times as much. Lindsey had no personality outside of being friendly and cute. While the summary says this is a road trip, that is a lie. The road trip ends very quickly. The rest of the book is spent in Tennessee. Conveniently, much like Alaska, Lindsey has no accent. But she is able to put one on in the blink of an eye. There is no plot in this book. There is no climax. If anything, it felt like a writing exercise. We knew that Colin was going to end up with Lindsey. We knew that Hassan wasn't going to keep his girlfriend. This was too predictable, even for Green. I didn't mind the math, but it was only there to prove that Colin was smart. I didn't believe that he was a prodigy. He seemed like one of those whiny gifted kids that complain about being smart when in reality they're just idiots. I recommend skipping everything but the flashbacks. You don't need to read the rest of the story. Like the title says, this is An Abundance of Katherines, and Katherine is the only good thing about it. ...more Yup. I'm still not a John Green fan. One thing I have noticed about the characters John Green creates in his novels: they're too quirky, they're smart (this one in particular has an overly smart character) and they talk in quips. NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE. At least not all the time. I think this is John's way of incorporating himself into his books.

However, there were some memorable parts of this book that makes it unique: Tangents and footnotes. I thought that was a very clever addition that screamed Colin. I did NOT like the repetitiveness of the word fug and the name Katherine. I now hate that name thanks to this book. Overall, this book was just sooo hard to get into... I had to force myself to keep reading hoping it will get better. Instead, this just wasted my time. I could have been reading a book more enjoyable than this one during my break. Sighhhh. I guess I expected so much but got a mediocre, predictable read from an author who is labelled as one of the best in YA. ...more If you are familiar with John Green, you probably already know his winning formula: a nerdy nice guy with a funny side-kick best friend, meets and falls in love with a mysterious popular but ultimately unhappy girl, then some kind of road trip ensues during which a life altering realization is achieved. \"An Abundance of Katherines\" is no exception.

Only this time the nerdy guy (Colin) is not that endearing (unlike Miles in \"Looking For Alaska\" or Quentin in \"Paper Town\"), the funny side-kick (Hassan) is not that funny, and the mysterious girl is not that mysterious or witty (compare Lindsey to Alaska and Margo). The 3rd person narration also doesn't help the cause. I think this kind of POV makes Colin unrelatable and exposes him for what he really is - a self-centered insecure super nerdy nerd whose head is full of theorems, anagrams, and numerous random facts. At some point you can't help but start thinking that if you were dating Colin, you'd break up with him just like all of his 19 ex-Katherines. In spite of all the flaws, the book is still moderately entertaining, the story picks up significantly in the end. And unlike \"Looking For Alaska\" and \"Paper Towns\" it has a satisfying happy (for a change) ending. \"An Abundance of Katherines\" is a decent read, just not as good as other John Green's books.

My favorite part about this book would have to be the characters. Colin is such a smart ass who had so much more to experience in life while Hassan was just a guy who wanted to shit for the hell of it. The drastic difference between their personalities really made their quest so much more fun. I loved Colin's obsession with the fact that he needed a \"Eureka\" moment, it was fantastic and one of the things that I'd expect a child prodigy not to be expected because his life is literally supposed to be filled with \"Eureka\" moments (come on, he's a genius!!). Overall, I really liked the \"finding yourself\" moral/theme that the book took (I think by now that it's time that I realize that the \"finding yourself\" story is John Green's specialty).

Not Catherine, Cathy, Kathy, Katrina, Kat, Cat, or any other variant. K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E. John Green\u2019s An Abundance of Katherines tells the story of Colin Singleton, a boy who\u2019s been dumped by nineteen Katherines, leading him to work on what he called the Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability, in which he aimed to foresee his future relationships. I believe this book wasn\u2019t what I expected it to be, yet I still enjoyed it. As a work of one of the most amazing authors of this age, I anticipated that I would have a hangover after reading it. It was a good light read. It was uncomplicated except for its math content which my brain almost wasn\u2019t able to absorb. I\u2019ve been wooing math for years, but it never loved me back! The plot was very unique. I\u2019ve never read any contemporary romance like it. The trivia speckling the pages, especially those found at the footnotes, helped kept my interest. Learning something new every time I read is something I enjoy immensely! The characters weren\u2019t flat and it\u2019s the aspect of the story that I liked best. They each had issues they had to deal with. Colin was the kind of young man I rarely read about in books these days. He was so broken-hearted and he wasn\u2019t afraid of showing his weakness. He was a child prodigy who had an obsession with anagramming. He was so adorable, but I understood the Katherines\u2019 reasons for dumping him. Hassan, Colin\u2019s best friend contributed most in making this a hilarious read. Together, Colin and Hassan were just epic. I loved that they could communicate with each other in different languages and that they could come up with words that only they would understand. Lindsey Lee Wells was a very honest character. She exhibited how complex any individual could be. She had different personalities or masks she had to put on for every group of people she met. She was dating the popular guy and went with his crowd, but it was as if she didn\u2019t really belong with them. What I didn\u2019t like that much with how the story flowed was that the climax wasn\u2019t that apparent. It was as if feeling for a nail on a flat wooden surface, but it was hammered too hard that you could not find it with just the touch of your fingertips. Although the plot twists were not mind-blowing, I love how they led to such a lovely ending that opened to new beginnings. It was filled with new things and hope for each of the significant characters. Overall, I think everyone who\u2019s ever been in love should check this out. I highly recommended it to math nerds and anagram nerds. ...more I think I already said this in a review but I might just need a break from young adult fiction, because everyone I know who reads YA raved about this novel and I read it from cover to cover without once really engaging, and with far too many inward groans and eye-rolls.

For another, the book kept trying to TEACH me. Always be yourself! Think about your choices! I'm not seventeen so these messages are, well, I'm a little old for them. And christ, every other word was \"fugging\" and after a while you just want someone to unleash a decent FUCK to get the party started. Don't get me wrong, the plot was original albeit a little contrived and there was definitely enough awkwardly endearing teenage moments for it to be funny and authentic. And there's nothing worse than an inauthentic YA novel so for that alone, I give Green massive kudos. If I were seventeen I would have lapped this shit right up. ...more This was definitely my least favourite book by John Green. For starters, Colin was absolutely unbearable. I disliked him so much and I hated listening to his inner monologue. He was so pretentious, arrogant, self-centred and he was just plain horrible.

His constant ramblings about Katherine drove me up the wall. He compared EVERYTHING to Katherine and it was so annoying. Nothing happened in the book and it felt like Paper Towns all over again. I did like Hassan. Why someone like Hassan would be friends with someone like Colin is beyond me. My feelings about Lindsey are sort of confusing. On one hand I sort of liked her and on the other I sort of hated her. At the end of the day though she is basically Alaska / Margo. Alaska and Margo were also popular and pretty yet empty inside and completely miserable. Colin also felt very similar to John Green's other male protagonists. I think characters are John Greens downfall. He kind of just recycles all of his characters and I just want more from him! There was no character development or proper plot. The best thing about it was the writing. John Green does have a way with words, I just don't think he properly utilised that talent with this book. Another thing I didn't like was the way some of the characters were described. I don't know whether that was down to John Green's writing or Colin's perception of them but I found it distasteful (particularly the way Hassan and a waitress were described). I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but I love John Green so I'm going to keep reading his books. ...more One of my roommates is a huge John Green fan, and after first introducing me to the series of videos he does with his brother (search \"vlogbrothers\" on Youtube or just watch this one ), she told me that I should probably read some of his books.

Which, I'll be honest, was a little weird. But cool. Anyway, the book is fun, kind of silly, full of very interesting footnotes and math, and pretty damn funny. Some other reviewers have complained about the main character, Colin, but I always enjoy a socially handicapped former child prodigy. And if that socially awkward former child prodigy happens to have dated (and been dumped by) eighteen girls named Katherine and insists at one point \"Love is graphable!\", so much the better. His narration is also very fun. \"When he exited the bathroom, his parents were sitting together on his bed. It was never a good sign when both his parents were in his room at the same time. Over the years it had meant: 1. Your grandmother/grandfather/Aunt-Suzie-whom-you-never-met-but-trust-me-she-was-nice-and-it's-a-shame is dead. 2. You're letting a girl named Katherine distract you from your studies. 3. Babies are made through an act that you will eventually find intriguing but for right now will just sort of horrify you, and also sometimes people do stuff that involves baby-making parts that does not actually involve making babies, like for instance kiss each other in places that are not on the face.

She still loves you and has made a terrible mistake and is waiting for you downstairs.\" ...more This book is ABSURD. The main character is some quirky prodigy kid who gets dumped by girls named Katherines. He goes on about some non-sense theory who might help him predict future relationships. He is smart, loves anagrams, and uses words no other teenager has ever heard of. You know what? I fully understand that disliking a John Green book is tantamount to asking to be shot in the head, tarred-n-feathered, and thrown in a flaming box over a cliff into a gorge of molten lava. I know that, I get that, I apologize to all whose lives I've destroyed with my hatredy. But, man, I did NOT like this book.

Also, about 20 per cent of the novel involves math equations and graphs, and I didn't get bored once. (I actually have no idea if 20% is a good estimate for the amount of math in this book, which is why it's amazing that I didn't fling it across the room in disgust at the first sign of cosines. Little math humor for ya, there.) One of the best things about Katherines is what happened after I finished it: I found John Green's website. Which led me to a project he's working on with his brother, Hank Green, proprietor of EcoGeek.org: http://www.brotherhood2.com For the entirety of 2007, John Green and Hank Green (both of whom are almost always, I am certain, referred to by their first and last names - it just feels right) have eschewed text-based communication and will communicate with one another by exchanging videos for all the world to see. There are also video visits from some of their \"secret siblings,\" which led me to a really funny YA writer named Maureen Johnson which led me to about ten other YA authors whose books are now on my hold list. (Apparently there's like a whole YA cool kids posse out there, but they all pride themselves on being nerds, which, fair enough, you're a YA author.) Anyway, Brotherhood 2.0, as the project is known, is very funny, and I'm completely addicted and smitten with the brothers Green and their gaggle of Nerd Fighters.

Like most other JG novels there are plenty of lol moments. But it\u2019s actually got a little bit of everything: adventure, math, historical factoids, flashbacks, funky characters and (a) tale of (a) boy/girl relationship(s): specifically, Colin/Katherine(s) relationships.

He was hard to like. Also, the footnotes drove me CRAZY. Despite them being a secret appendix or whatever (despite the fact that I was excited that Daniel Biss made an appearance through words in the book), they were unnecessary and annoying. The ones for translating the French or Arabic dialogue were good, but otherwise they just weren't. Another thing I disliked was the Theorem. It was unnecessary and I feel that it bogged the book down. All of the graphs bogged the book down as well. It took me a little under two weeks to read (which is saying a LOT because the book is a mere 215 pages without the note from John or the Appendix by Daniel) and I was disappointed with the end result.
