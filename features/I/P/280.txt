Which, by the way, is extremely disappointing, considering that I really did like the first book. *sigh* I don't like to bash books and insult the author, but I will say why I did give it such a low rating, in a hopefully non-rude way. *My Opinion. Just a reminder, in case you're thinking about ripping me apart.* My Opinion is.... Nothing happened throughout this book. I literally spent 319/323 pages reading about America's ever-changing feelings for Aspen and Maxon, which, by the way, was by far one of the most infuriating and unrealistic love triangles I have ever read about. How, please tell me, did Maxon still \"love\" America after how uncaring she was towards his feelings? I understand that she was still kind of confused about her supposed \"feelings\" for Aspen, but after the fourth or fifth time she led on, and then proceeded to reject both boys, I would've just given up. There was no excuse for her to be angry that Maxon was seeing the other girls. He deserved to love someone who would reciprocate that emotion, even it that \"someone\" was <---C>Celeste</---C>. Or Kriss. Or even freaking Aspen . *plot twist, Aspen and Maxon are in love* (<---B>i ship it</---B>) Besides the constant push-pull of America's emotions and how indecisive and clumsy she was with the two boys' hearts, the dialogue. Oh, the dialogue. And the dreadful CRYING. Every. Other. Page. That aside, I felt as though the characters were robots. There was no realistic motive behind any of their interactions, whether those interactions were verbally or physically. It felt like a bad sitcom. Everything was scripted (which it kind of is, in a sense), nothing felt realistic or raw , and if I had to read the work WONDERFUL one more time I was going to FLIP. When is Cass's birthday? I'll get her a thesaurus. I was honestly so close to throwing this book at the wall in frustration but as much as I despise some books I simply cannot because it's still a book and my whacked out brain believes they have feelings so THANK YOU KURT The number of facepalms this book and I shared was astronomical. I have a bruise on my forehead. Dear America: I have other things to say, but they'd just be negative towards the book, and I think I've said enough derogative things. But OH MY GOD I COULDN'T STAND THIS A disappointment in the end. I rarely do this, but do to the aggravation this book put me through and how much chocolate I had to eat to get through this (i blame you, <+++>The Elite</+++>, for the approximately 50 pounds I gained), I won't be reading The One . Or maybe I'll wait to see if that one is better. We'll see. If you enjoyed this book, good for you! I wish I did too. If you didn't, I feel ya. I will say something nice about this book, and that is that this series has seriously the prettiest covers ever . Too bad there isn't a separate rating for books covers. I normally hate when you see the character on the cover too, because they usually turn out looking different than how I picture them in my head, but this one is an exception. So, pretty dress? Too bad that doesn't make up for well, everything else . I'm going to go eat more chocolate and watch criminal minds to make myself feel better. *please don't kill me for writing this review* *I'm actually a nice person I swear* *gives you some of my chocolate so you won't hurt me* Um hello update: 170 likes?!

I love Maxon. *Maxon does something needlessly cruel in dramatic fashion* America: I hate Maxon. *runs off to see Aspen* *For less unexplained but equally convenient reasons, she has second thoughts about leaving Maxon* America: Aspen who? I love Maxon. (At this point I'm just too irritated to continue copy/pasting) Is anyone else seeing a pattern here? Like maybe the plot is just one big, long, stretched out love triangle? A poorly done love triangle at that? One that isn't even resolved? I don't know, I didn't really mind The Selection because the Bachelor -like elements (in other words, the catty contestants), while stereotypical, were somewhat amusing, but this is just messed up relationship melodrama between chapters of America replaying her emotional baggage in her head over and over and over again, and it's... unimaginably boring? Indescribably pointless? Frustratingly annoying? Where'd evil Celeste go? Plus some other (somewhat random) observations, because this is not a book that's inspiring me to write a coherent review: - What Happened to the Bachelor -style Competition?: Personally, that was the only draw of the first book. Yes it was cheesy. But so what? The Selection was terrible as a dystopian, but at least it had that, so it wasn't a complete loss. The Elite seems to eschew the only thing that made the first book bearable in favor of the aforementioned love triangle - why? - The World Building, Redux: Even from The Selection , we should know world building is not this series's strong suit. Still, while I admire Kiera Cass trying again, this time with more about the history of Ilea, some conspiracy involving the first king's diary, and stuff about the caste system and foreign diplomacy, all of it is so simple to the point that actually reading about it feels more painful than watching a Miss America contestant discuss world geography. - The Rebels of Complete Fail: I get it. Actually, I don't. There are the Northerners. There are the Southerners. It's implied they want something. But when the biggest plot development is a scrap of crucial information incompetently left in the hallway just conveniently for America to find, WTF? - Maxon & Celeste: What the heck? No. Just no. If I were on the fence about the rest of the book, last straw dude, last straw. Anyway, I wasn't expecting anything more from The Elite than shallow, petty drama. And somehow, it still fails at even that. ...more Deleted previous posted review. 7-1-2012: 3:48 PM. Yay! It has a name! I'm so excited for this book! 8-7-2012: 4:19 PM. Why does this have likes?!

If this book is supposed to be wrapped around the Elite Three, shouldn't there be more than just America? BUT THAT DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL, AT LEAST. 5-9-2013: I FINALLY got my greedy little hands on the copy of The Elite and what can I say...? WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT? It was absolutely brilliant reading this novel! You may want to clear your whole schedule because once you start reading, stopping to do anything else will annoy you! Without further interruption, here is my review of this gem. (: 4 out of 5 stars! Cover As you may or may not have read in my sweet ramblings at the the top here, I'm... not a huge fan of the cover but I won't complain about it- ok, yes I will- it's SIMPLE and I simply wanted more. I do not like the non-concealed face of the woman and the dress is just... I don't even think this dress went along with any of he dresses in the story! BUT, nevertheless, it looks absolutely lovely sitting next to The Selection on my bookcase, so I'll give it that. General Summary In this installment of The Bachelor meets The Hunger Games meets Twilight .... No, just kidding. (; In this installment by the lovely Kiera Cass , Prince Maxon has to decide between the final girls left in the selection, or better known as the Elite girls. All the while, America, our lovely heroine, is still trying to debate on who she wants to be with- Prince Maxon or Aspen- or better yet, The Crown or her Childhood. Along the journey, America has to watch as Prince Maxon tries to fall for the other girls (breaking MY heart) and the girls are set out to do tasks that a future queen would likely do- such as a project (and America's idea is... scandalous to say the least). In the mix of all the lies, love, betrayal and... whippings comes the horrible rebels who are after something... something to do with books. Something, America has to figure out. Opinions, General Fangirl Squealing, and Spoilers PRINCE MAXON I LOVE YOU. Well, aside from my pure and complete fascination and devotion towards Maxon, the book was,... so-so. I did like it a lot better than I did the first (hence the 4 stars), though it WAS lacking and I couldn't help but get a bit annoyed with America's \"I love Aspen. No I want Maxon. But Aspen is safe. But I love Maxon. But I don't want the crown...\" blah blah blah blah BLAH. And there wasn't much Maxon to even begin with. I mean, he was there and he was all lovey dovey and mushy and brilliant, but most of the time it was just America talking about him. Only for Aspen to ruin it. Now, I'm not an Aspen hater, I'd respect it if America ended up with him, but I wouldn't like it at all. I just don't think he is encouraging enough towards America. He wants her to be brilliant- but as long as he is somehow involved. He wants her to do this and do that and be herself but be quiet and respectful and he doesn't think she can handle the Crown? No. That is not someone I want to see America with. She's a bright, young girl and I'd love it if someone who is encouraging of her ideas would be with her. Celeste... Celeste, Celeste, Celeste... You and I had problems in the first book, ma'am and I told you to back off Maxon and just blend in with the background (and for the most part you honored that) but you HAD to go and pull that little thing with Maxon, you dirty girl. I wanted to reach into the book and give Maxon a shower since you had your hands all over his Prince-lyness. /glares at her/ I'm happy for Marlee, at least. I'm going to miss her. (: And what of these rebels? What are you guys after... And King Clarkson... I'm watching you... Leave America alone. Her idea was splendid! All in all, the book was lovely, not everything I had hoped for because there are still A LOT of unanswered questions (and I mean A LOT), but I'm hoping Cass can wrap them up nicely in The One . I'm hopeful it'll be a brilliant series. AND I HOPE THE COVER FOR THE NEXT BOOK IS GREEN (hint hint Miss Cass, if you're reading this). ...more Warning: Mild Spoilers Ahead.

Believe it or not, I did like The Selection , but this book, unfortunately, did not live up to its predecessor. The reason why I enjoyed The Selection so much was because of the similarities to the TV show The Bachelor (which I watch, occasionally). I personally think adapting the competition into a book was a nice idea. Even though it was predictable, cliched and pretty cheesy, I still had a lot of fun reading it. But this book, as I said, annoyed me to no end. The crucial element that made The Selection worth reading was gone, and replaced by the MC's constant insecurity issues and a back-and-forth love triangle between our dear America and Prince charming Maxon Schreave + First love Aspen Leger. First things first, the plot. As you can tell, the main storyline of the series is about a competition named The Selection, in which the palace picks out the new princess for their country, Illea. The Selection is actually a live show broadcasted to all the citizens of the country, and is one of the biggest celebration events of the country. In The Selection, the selected has to interact with the prince, and if the prince dislikes someone, he can kick her out of the game. At the end of the first book, the number of girls in the running was reduced from thirty five to six, also known as The Elite. Our main protagonist, America, is one of the girls who remained in the competition. Moreover, she's the one the prince adores and wants to marry, but as you can guess, it's not so simple, because America is also in love with her first love, Aspen, who turned out to be one of the guards in the palace. Basically the plot of this book is about Maxon trying to convince America to be with him, while America doubts Maxon's sincerity and her ability to be a princess. And at the times when she believes that Maxon is \"just like the others\" or \"playing with her feelings\", she just runs to Aspen for comfort. And so this brings us to the love triangle. The love triangle never bothered me in the first book, mainly because it was obvious she's going to end up with Maxon, and there wasn't much of Aspen. But in here, America was constantly going back and forth between Maxon and Aspen. (Ha, their names rhyme!) While she fell in love with Maxon, and wanted to stay with him, she fell victim to her insecurity and went hot and cold towards Maxon. And when Maxon went to find out if he could like the other girls, in case America leaves him, she just kind of used Aspen for comfort. Her insecurity and doubting bothered me a lot. I mean, why can't she just choose someone already? It's not like she doesn't know what she wants, she just kept on acting stubborn and wouldn't forgive Maxon for something he didn't do, EVEN THOUGH SHE WANTED TO. What the hell? There was never a need for a love triangle, because we all know who she'll end up with, and therefore the \"love triangle\" is really just America's denial issues. The plot also \"centered\" on the rebel attacks. THAT IS A LIE. Here's what the premise promised. \"The violent rebels that are determined to overthrow the monarchy are growing stronger and their plans could destroy her chance at any kind of happy ending.\" Did we really get that? Not really. As described above, the rebels were supposed to be \"violent\" and powerful enough to \"destroy her chance at any kind of happy ending\", but in truth, the rebels only showed up for around three chapters or so. AND ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENED. Sure, the rebels killed people. But no one major died, except maybe the sister of one of the Elites, which is still unimportant. Now now, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that those people's lives aren't important. I meant that the rebel attacks isn't the spotlight of this book, it is the LOVE TRIANGLE . The rebel attacks is just mostly there . Yes, it did influence the main characters' lives, but not much. It's mostly just a secondary plot. So why did I say that nothing happened? Because despite that, all they really did was \"damaged the walls of the hallways of this magnificent palace\", which really counts as nothing. Plus, there was this scene towards the end of the book, in which America and Maxon were stuck in a safe house together during a rebel attack, and they basically had this romantic night and sorted things out. So I wouldn't really consider the attack of the rebels as \"destroying her chance at a happy ending\", but more of a \"creating an awesome chance at spending a night together with a prince\". Here's another thing, towards the end of the book, America discovered that what the rebel really wants was books. Yes, BOOKS and Gregory Illea's diary, I'll get to that later, but that really doesn't make any difference . WHAT KIND OF REBELS WOULD WANT TO STEAL BOOKS? That is just ridiculous. The worst thing is that, America found out about that sooo late, whereas I noticed it when I was around 50% in. It was OBVIOUS . Why, you ask? WELL BECAUSE THE REBELS ONLY TOOK THE BOOKS. Okay, so there was another scene when there was another rebel attack, and America had to run to a tree and hide up there. And when one of the rebels passed, she noticed that the rebel was carrying loads of books, ONLY. I can't believe how she can be so *coughs* smart . Her IQ really amazed me. And there is something a whole lot more ridiculous than that . That is, when the rebel walked pass her, she (rebel) fell and noticed America holing up on a tree, and you know what she (rebel) did? SHE BOWED. WHAT THE FUCK? *sigh* Sorry for the swear word, I just...couldn't help myself. Now, the characters. In The Elite , America Singer, our very own protagonist, is unbearable. I really can't stand her doubts and insecurity and constant break downs. I actually thought she was an okay character in The Selection . Although annoying at times, I did like how she brought a change into the palace and actually treated her maids, her friends nicely. That's why I don't get how she suddenly turned into a coward. She kept on saying that she isn't princess material and doubts her own abilities. And she also kept on thinking that the other contestants are better than her (or their place in the caste system are higher, she's the lowest!), and that she doesn't get how Maxon could love her when there are so many people who's a lot better than her willing to throw themselves to him. What's worse, she kept on crying . Whenever she is faced with some minor conflicts (*weeps*Maxon doesn't like me, he likes Kriss*sobs*), she just starts CRYING! THAT is something I cannot stand. I really hate it when heroines break down when faced with a minor problem. Here's another thing I can't bear, the oh-I-want-answers-but-I'm-too-afraid-to-ask thing. There are a lot of times when America was wondering about something, and kept wanting to ask about, but just wouldn't. The reason is either I-decided-that-I-didn't-want-to-hear-it or I'm-too-afraid-to-hear-him-say-it or I-don't-want-to-intrude-someone's-privacy. MY GOD, AMERICA! If you want an answer, JUST FUCKING ASK! This is not a good way to keep people in suspense. It usually just frustrates people. So, please , don't ever do that again! *Ugh, see what you did there? You just made me swear AGAIN.* I have to give Kiera Cass some credit. Although America's annoying as hell, I actually liked America a lot better than Juliette, so yeah...thanks for not letting me hate the MC! ;) The only time I liked America was when she presented this report about wanting to destroy the caste system to the whole country. That is a really brave act. It's reckless, so what? I like it. But then everything went downhill again. She started begging for Maxon to forgive her, but the reason she said all that was because she decided she didn't care what anyone think. *sigh* The irony. I really hate it when I finally like her more, then she does something hypocritical. I have to admit, I loved Maxon in The Selection . He was this awkward sweet prince who never entered a relationship, and is naive and hot as hell. But in The Elite , he turned a bit too serious. There was some problems he could've avoided if he would just talk to America. I believe that communication is really important if you want to maintain a relationship. There were things he shouldn't have held back. Plus, I really don't like the fact that he also likes Kriss, one of the other contestants. Maybe not as much as he likes America, but I guess I'm just biased. I mean, America can like two people at once, why can't he? But...it's hard to explain, but I just don't like it. Anyway, I really think he should've proposed when he wanted to, there wouldn't have been so many issues if he had. Aspen. Well, I never really liked him, except maybe at the beginning of The Selection . The thing is, he actually told America that she's not fit for a princess. He said something like \"I just don't see it in you\". And that led to America's self-doubting. I really don't think he should've said that even though he was jealous/honest, whatever. It's just not...nice. I mean, why can't she? Everyone can if they're willing to try. He really shouldn't have discouraged her. Despite all that, I kind of feel bad for him. He's the guy who America turns to when there are problems between her and Maxon. And that's WRONG. America shouldn't have led him on when there wasn't really a chance for him, therefore I feel bad for him. I do hope that he finds his own happiness in the last book. The secondary characters. Marlee. She's one of the characters I actually have nothing against, if not like. There's not A LOT of her in here, though. But her big reveal did have a huge impact on everything. Celeste. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HATEFUL BITCH? She was pretty boring in The Elite , she never did anything evil again. I never thought I'd say this, but I kind of miss it. Kriss. She turned into a pretty important character in this book. Mostly because Maxon likes her, AND THEREFORE I DON'T. I'm sorry, but I just don't like the idea of Maxon liking someone else at the same time. Other than that, I don't really have anything against her, I just think she's too optimistic to be real. The other girls. They're mostly just there . But one of them DID say something pretty mean. Elise, another contestant, actually told America that they weren't friends and that she wouldn't EVER help her because they were in a competition. While I can understand that, I just don't get why she has to say it out loud. That's just HARSH . The maids. I liked them in The Selection , but while I still like them here, I just don't like them as much. They were nicer in the first book. I promised I'll write about this, and here it is. Gregory Illea's diaries. They're basically about how Gregory gained enough power to build this country. It turns out that this \"saint\" everyone loves, is a douche. He's pretentious, and power hungry. He made the caste system (Yes, there's a caste system!) just so he could get more power. But I don't get why the rebels want his diaries. I hope it's explained in The One. Despite this hateful review, I DON'T hate this book. There were just parts that annoyed me. I seriously don't know how many times the book made me roll my eyes, but I still enjoyed the reading process, just not as much as the first book. This was a HUGE disappointment, but I will be reading The One . I'm just really curious about how it will end, although the title says it all. This is the most lengthy review I've ever written, please do bear with me if there's any grammar mistakes, as I've just finished typing this! I *might* be adding more thoughts if anything new occurred to me, I've finished this book for three days already, and there are just things I really can't think of, so I may be editing this again sometime in the near future. I apologize if this review offended anyone, this is just my honest opinion. ...more All right, boys and girls, I\u2019m back for round two.

GET SOME SNIPERS ON YOUR ROOF. You have guns. I know you have guns, you said so right there. Also, rebels, build some freaking bombs so you\u2019re not just hurling bricks at windows, it\u2019s not that hard. In general, I find Cass\u2019s understanding of rebellion to be very hilarious. In our modern world, especially in America, \u201crebel\u201d has a fairly positive connotation, I think because of the way the US clings to its past as badass rebels against those effete Brits. Nowadays, rebels are generally called terrorists, because terrorism has a purely negative connotation. The author seems unwilling to use the word however, due to a (spoiler for The One), but that\u2019s what the government should be calling them. When you want people not to sympathize with a group of insurgents, you label them terrorists. Why doesn\u2019t this government do that? Oh right, because it\u2019s run by a pair of idiots. (Btw, if you\u2019re interested in asymmetrical warfare as it actually works and has worked, I like Invisible Armies by Max Boot. Smart guy.) 2.\tUNINTENTIONAL MISOGYNY.

Women aren\u2019t property anymore that need to be \u201cgiven away.\u201d This conversation is especially awful in light of what DOES happen at the end of The One. 3.\t'MURRICA: America is a terrible, terrible person. She seemed mostly harmless in the first book, but now she\u2019s just an actively horrible human being. She can\u2019t understand the \u201cdifficult\u201d reports she\u2019s supposed to study (that\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t always understand complicated economic or foreign policy), but instead of making an effort to learn, she literally says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to focus on it.\u201d Your heroine, ladies and gentlemen. The future Princess and Queen of your country. You really want this lazy, aggressively stupid, willfully ignorant chick as your leader? Can you imagine Michelle Obama or Kate M being like, \"lol it's too hard I'm not going to read it.\" Then she goes on TV to give an opinion on these reports she doesn't study. Reports about the war. A war in which people die. No, America, you should not be a princess if literally your only basis for making decisions is, \"Celeste says the opposite thing, so I'm going to say this thing.\" Our heroine also makes fun of Marlee for not being able to learn her scales in ONE WHOLE WEEK. Pianists practice their scales for years. Even after they stop just playing scales, they still practice etudes forever. Seriously, couldn't the author be bothered to learn something this basic? 4.\tHALLOWEEN: Yes, I know it\u2019s supposed to be sweet and romantic that Maxon revived a holiday just for his special snowflake America. It\u2019s not, and America, as a Five, shouldn\u2019t think so. He\u2019s literally wasting money and resources (when people are starving) to have a fancy party for America, and if she was fit to be a princess, she would have shut that down. It\u2019s very Marie Antoinette, and we know how that story ends in the real world. 5.\tTHE FUTURE: This vision of the future is a Tea Party conspiracy theorist's wet dream, crossed with a dose of Randian money worship. China takes over the world and a rich businessman buys their way out. Okie doke. I don\u2019t even know how to begin to deconstruct all of Gregory\u2019s nonsensical diaries and the history of the American State of China. I have a lot of things to say about this, but all of it would be academic and boring, so I\u2019ll confine myself to, if the Chinese ever do try to invade, America, launch your nukes. You have like 40 times as many. 6.\tFOREIGN RELATIONS LOL WATS THAT: I feel like the author has a very limited understanding of the way official functions are planned. There is no reason why the girls can\u2019t have party planners and country experts to help them out while preparing to host the Germans and Italians. The State Department (or Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or any similar department that every major government everywhere in the world through history has ever had) has staff on hand specifically for this kind of situation, let alone the staff that the White House/First Lady has. It would have been far more interesting to see the girls have to take charge of a team of people, because that would be showing their leadership skills. Whatever, I can\u2019t even get too worked up about this or else my head will explode, but it demonstrates such a shallow understanding about the way the world works. Anyway, foreign relations doesn't merely involve hosting a party for your guests, though that's a good first step. Important decisions get made here. Alliances are formed. America, however, doesn't bother telling us why these foreign dignitaries are here. Her whole focus is on throwing a better party than the other team. Which is not unimportant, but her inability to see beyond that is a mark of incredible self-centeredness, which is a terrible quality in a future leader. Seriously, why are these people here? How can they help? Are we talking money? Armies? What??? Why don't you know anything, America? 7.\tSOME WORDS OF PRAISE: The diction and writing in this book is much improved from the first one. At least there were no menacingly twirled forks. Gold star for effort. FAQ Q: If you hate these books, why do you keep reading? A: I\u2019m a glutton for punishment. Also, they are unintentionally hilarious. Like, laugh out loud in public hilarious. Q: I like these books, does that make me a bad/stupid person? A: No. Read whatever you want, lord knows I do. I am interested, however, in why you like the book. Leave me a note! Q: The Selection is the best book ever and I hope you die. A: If this is how you deal with opinions that disagree with you in real life, you\u2019re in for a lot of disappointment. Q: It\u2019s just a book/fantasy/dystopia/whatever, get over it. A: I demand quality from my fiction. Why don\u2019t you? ...more I raced through this book because I love the concept and where the story seems to be heading, but OH MY GOODNESS America was so frustrating. I discuss the whole thing in depth in my booktalk here: http://youtu.be/m7UHt8a4G9g This is what the first book did: I don't know how Cass is going to stretch this into a trilogy. I honestly don't. Unless this has another beautiful cover I can't resist, I'm going to avoid this book like the plague. Update 7/23 So... I finished this book. It was just as awful as the first, if not worse. It's worse in that it tries to develop a love triangle and makes a bad name for women everywhere. America decides to love whichever guy is in the room and then forget him the moment he leaves it. This is what the first book did: I don't know how Cass is going to stretch this into a trilogy. I honestly don't.

It's worse in that it tries to develop a love triangle and makes a bad name for women everywhere. America decides to love whichever guy is in the room and then forget him the moment he leaves it. The book attempts to explain what happened and to contribute to the whole dystopian aspect, but the explanation is extremely weak, given through the ever-cliche diary from a really old dead guy who happens to be very important. I can't say that men are given a very good image either, though. Maxon talks about how much he loves America while consorting with other women and trying to make himself \"feel good,\" which is literally how he justifies it. And of course, we see how he has a troubled past brought on by a violent upbringing. I didn't find any part of this book enjoyable, but I want to finish this series and find out what the hell actually happens. None of the characters have struck me as anything but fickle and one-dimensional, with the exception of Aspen. He remains constant, though in a very shallow manner. It's not about how the author has been horrible, anymore. This book is bad. Exceptionally bad. If I haven't ever questioned how the publishing industry works, I am certainly questioning it now. The writing style is stilted and sounds as if it's catering to elementary schoolers. The plot is not developed in the least, and the characters have all been built to fit some sort of mold, but they can't even seem to accomplish that. All in all, this series lacks class and cohesiveness, attempting to throw out twists that absolutely contribute nothing. Originally I started reading this to get over the pain that Siege and Storm had instilled in me, but now it's just created this little pit of disgust in my stomach. Bleeech. ...more America is such a frustrating protagonist, but these books are so fast and addictive I CAN'T PUT THEM DOWN. Onto The One...

If I did I would be at Disney World right now living the dream instead of writing this during one of my very limited study breaks. And now a word from the Disney Princesses... We here at the Magic Kingdom full of princess want to make something clear to you, America Singer is not a princess. Because I'm the only princess that likes to read or one of the only few that can read I've been dubbed to discuss this fraud of a princess. All I have to say, Beast (or should I say Adam because that's what Disney Wikia says his human name is) better buy me a whole library after reading this. Sigh.... What is a princess? A princess isn't just someone of royal birth. Here at Disney there has to be something special, something unique about you that makes you search for more. In my case, it was my intelligence. Most women in my time period were happy being Gaston's bimbo. I was not. Another example, Ariel wanted to be human in a world full of fin lovers. And even Snow White, was...well, pretty and ran away from home. Okay, maybe America is a little more competent than Snow. Um, or maybe not. Because really, Snow cares about those dwarves. I suppose you could make a claim America cares about her maids or maybe that Marlee girl, but that's just to tell her how pretty she is and how Maxon loves her. She doesn't even know how interact with other girls without being mean to them. Obviously, she's never seen Sophia the First. Then there's the history of her kingdom. Her world. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I know I come from fictional France where people speak English unless they're saying Bonjour! But we still had social issues. With women being told they couldn't read. Princes not knowing how to take care of their kingdoms and being changed to hairy monsters leaving the rest of us to go around singing and wanting something more. Well, it made sense in my movie. I think a better princess's world to talk about would be Mulan's. Fictional China, though slightly offensive, was well formed. The fact that the society was male dominated was heightened throughout several of the plots and subplots of the movie. Conflict arouse becuase of society's rules-i.e. Mulan felt like an outcast because she couldn't get a man and cut off her hair because women weren't allowed to join the army. To sum it up, there were reasons for her actions. In The Elite.... Not so much. Much of the world building seems thrown together and none of it makes any logical sense. Maybe it's because I've been reading too much Plato lately or have watched the news (yes, we get CNN at the Magic Kingdom-don't tell anyone), but the way Illea was formed, the way its society works, its history is illogical. And yes, I've heard the Stephanie Meyer it's fiction excuse. And living a fictional existence myself, I am entitled to call bull shit on this one. Heavens, did I curse? Don't tell The Mouse, okay? Alright, it's back to scholarly Belle. How is this book illogical? Well, my dear readers let's talk about how Illea was formed. Or should I say how the United States fell apart. China overtook America when the US didn't pay their debts. Counterintuitive much? But America didn't pay back their money, shouldn't China invade? Um, not if they want their money back or don't want to get nuked. Seriously, China would not be stupid enough to do that. Plus, do you really think the UN would go along with that? And hello, America has nukes? Must I reiterate that. Probably everyone would be dead if the two started battling each other. God, I feel like Jeff Golblum from Independence Day. So, not becoming for a Disney princess. If that's not bad enough, then there's the actually forming of Illea. The explanation is weak at best. A former country that was brought on freedom, is probably not likely to accept a caste system just because some dimwit who claims he's king says so. There's usually no social political issues at work here other than the king not liking you. Really? You don't think you're going to have any oppression other than these random Rebels who have apparently no power base but run around amok. Completely random into the palace. Multiple times. Multiple times! I'm a princess. I'm supposed to like fluff, but this is just too much You know what we do at Beast's (I meant Adam's) castle when we have intruders well throw them in the dungeon. And you don't get out until your daughter decides to take your place... Trespassers don't get past the Beast. And you know what, Illea really needs a Beast. That kingdom lacks authority. You'd think that a king like Clarkson who likes to kick his son around would be a bit of an authority figure but no....He just barks a bit and then everything is okay. Which makes you wonder... Or would make you wonder if something happened in this book. Really, nothing happened. You know how every princess has an adventures. My adventure was falling in love with a beast and dealing with a crazy stalker, Cinderella had to deal with that evil stepmother, and even Pocahontas had an adventure-sort of- though it mostly consisted of looking like she was a perfume model. What is America's adventure? Sitting around getting groomed all day and reading a dead king's diary that's just sitting around there for her to read even though it's more incriminating than The Pelican Brief (now, that's a good book). I guess wouldn't mind so much if the rest of the book wasn't so misogynic. We princesses get a bad rap for being anti-feminist which I think is ridiculous. I mean, sure we might all get the guy and live in a big castle and not have to worry about getting a real job, but we all (well, most of us) have goals and ambitions. Well, more than this girl. And you know what really annoys me, America doesn't realize how backwards she is. While she rambles on and on about how the king who wrote his diary objectified his daughter to something that was similar to what America herself was going through, America doesn't recognize that her parents essentially did the same thing to her. It was perfect moment for reflection and instead of utilizing it Cass...well, excuse the horrible pun, castrated it. This moment should've been a part of realization. Instead, Cass uses it as a stupid plot point. I really don't understand why people think America Singer should be a princess. Princesses aren't just supposed to look pretty. Maybe we Disney princesses seem overly old school in our frilly gowns, but honestly we're pretty kick ass. Even old school princesses had their moments. Cinderella, for example, had the gall to go to the ball. Aurora snuck out. Snow White ran away from home. And you have to say there are other princesses out there fictional and real princesses that kick ass. Princess Leila, Princess Mia, Princess Diana. Those are only a few. All three of these women did more than just look great. And while Mia and Leila were fictional characters, they influenced a lot of people. Really, America, you are not a princess. Advisory Review: No. No. No. No. Get the picture. I won't read this unless I somehow get a copy for free like I did the first time. The first book was horribly written, full of plot holes, plus poor characters. And seriously, do you think I want to read a book by an author/agent who calls reviewers derogatory names. I have to comment on the cover. Seriously, that's the cover another pretty dress. At least they got the pose semi right this time (she's not sniffing her own B.O.) but the model just looks so lifeless. She is so not smizing and it doesn't help that her hair sort of clashes with the dress. JMO though. Note, trolls are not tolerated. I get that people have different views of books. But this is my opinion pure and simple. I am writing it, quite honestly, to remind myself why I don't want to buy or read this book in the future. If you have a problem with it write your own review, but this is my opinion. ...more OMFG IT FINALLY HAS A COVER!!!! First off I must say that that is a stunning dress!

I couldn't concentrate on anything until I finished and luckily I already read most of it at home so there wasn't that much to go. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with that awkward love triangle and hopefully more plot twists. Also with the contestants narrowed down so much there's probably going to be a lot more... hmm, how should I put this... bitchiness. There, that's a good word... kind of; I also could have gone with competition but meh. And you know what, I'm not really sure what to expect besides the competition and love triangle in terms of plot but hey that's just one more thing to look forward to.

America and Maxon have their moments where I really like them, but most of the time I hate them, but I love to hate them? I don't understand it. There's just something about these books that gets me worked up enough to yell at the characters and *literally* face palm at their stupidity. If any book gets me that passionate it's worth the reading experience! For a sequel, this wasn't the best, and definitely wasn't as good as The Selection, but still an interesting piece to the story.

Or maybe that's simply because I knew what to expect, so my hopes weren't high to begin with? Still want that tiara. I've full on ranted discussed about characterization in my review of the first book, and since the special cookie that is America still suffers from the same problems , I won't be going into characterization in this review. If anyone wants to know every little problem I had with America, I will just direct you to my first review . I'll get the good stuff out of the way first, before I bag this book to the gutters: 1) Purely as a romance, this book was alright . Kiera Cass ought to stick to writing YA romance. Keep the dystopia / politics / other-elements-that-require-cohesive-and-logical-world-building to the pros, alrighty? Or at least ... I don't know ... plan it out a little better? I'll get to that later. Cass can really get me sucked in and riled up about the romantic tension in her book. This was not true for The Selection , but some bits really did get to me in The Elite . For instance, what America caught Maxon doing -- and ended up forgiving him for? -- that pissed me off. I actually found myself screaming in my head, what an asshole! jerk! Pick up your bags and leave , America! Right now! 2) America was actually a slightly better character . I still didn't like her, but at least she grew a pair. I would have at least waited until the Queen was out of the room, or chosen a less physical way to stand up for her beliefs, but the bottom line is, at least she wasn't such a doormat this time. And I think those were the only redeeming qualities I could find. Well, those two and the fan art. (view spoiler) [credit: tumblr (hide spoiler) ] But now, on to the ugly. What really lost this for me was one of the things I briefly mentioned in my review of the first book: The Worldbuilding . It seems Cass did not learn from her previous book. In fact, having found some measure of success from it, she follows the same formula. I assure you, nothing is different. The rebel attacks is one such example. I think in this book there were about ... three? four? attacks to the palace. All of them within close timing to one another. Even America notes this herself-- How was it possible that rebels had gotten into the palace two days in a row? Two days in a row! Had things gotten so much worse on the outside since the Selection had begun? --as if the author wanted us to know she realizes it doesn't make sense for it to happen, but any logical explanations are brushed aside and made to seem irrelevant simply by our main character acknowledging this discrepancy. I also have to add that, during one scene, we actually come to see that the rebels are young adults themselves. So let me just rehash this just in case I'm not analyzing it correctly: - four rebel attacks within short time frames - at least one attack managed to cause casualties - time and time again the alarms were resounded only after the rebels had penetrated into the palace - the rebels may as well have been children for their youth - there is no sign of the King making attempts of chasing/capturing the rebels to actively prevent future attacks - there is no sign of any improvements upon the security of the palace. In fact, each time after the rebels attacked, the event is not even discussed between the Elite, or even the royal household. So not only is Il\u00e9a governed by a tyrant, he is also an incredibly stupid tyrant who utterly fails at the security of his own home. How a King that cannot even protect his own palace walls manages to keep hold on an entire Kingdom baffles me. But as if having ridiculously forced rebel attacks was not enough, just as it was in The Selection , nothing actually happened during the attacks! Sure, everyone comes out of hiding to find the walls sprawled with: WE ARE COMING. Oh I am just shaking in my undies. Sure, some guards and nameless servants were killed during the action. But none of the characters who mattered were ever in any sense of danger , making it rather useless to be honest. If you don't believe in the absolute uselessness of Cass ' attempts of having us worry for her characters -- take the scene where Maxon and his father flies off to New Asia [*] to resolve some sort of conflict. Upon their arrival, a brief paragraph was given on how they were never found ... and then, a few pages later, we were told they were heading back to Il\u00e9a. No harm, no other mention of the conflict. What a massively useless side plot. [*sidenote:] really? New Asia? Well done blocking an entire continent covering almost 9% of the Earth's surface and comprising of over fifty different sovereign states and dependent territories into one massive entity under one kingdom. Another odd thing I found about the worldbuilding is how utterly ridiculous it was that every new country in this book is a Kingdom . I simply find it hard to believe that many, many years into the future, our world would have de volved into Sovereign Monarchies. Italy is a Monarchy. Germany is a Monarchy. NEW ASIA the bloody whole CONTINENT I assume is under one Monarchy. You see all that? That's Asia. No country in their right mind would let the whole thing unite under ONE GOVERNMENT holy shit. I'm Asian and I'm terrified at the thought. I'll end this review with a list of my pet peeves. The names. - America Singer sounds pretty tame compared to the whole lot. - Woodwork brings me straight back to high school. - Markson now this is just getting annoying. - Maxon Schreave *snort*. - Amberly Station Schreave sounds like a monopoly property card. aaaaand my personal favourite: - King Clarkson BAHAHAHAHAHAHA [note:] the amount of effort evident in my brilliant photoshop job corresponds to the amount of credit I give to this book. 21 Oct.

No estaba preparado. Mira que al principio (en plan, como las cien primeras p\u00e1ginas) no estaba muy seguro de que The Elite me fuera a gustar tanto como The Selection .

Te Vale. Bien. No estaba preparado. Mira que al principio (en plan, como las cien primeras p\u00e1ginas) no estaba muy seguro de que The Elite me fuera a gustar tanto como The Selection . Ten\u00eda bastante claro que lo estaba leyendo a buen ritmo, pero que en realidad nada me estaba sorprendiendo y que lo le\u00eda porque no s\u00e9, la Cass es muy diva. Pero, sinceramente, no me esperaba lo que ocurre despu\u00e9s. Esta rese\u00f1a contendr\u00e1 spoilers, as\u00ed que lo siento si quer\u00edas saber qu\u00e9 me ha parecido sin leer ninguno. Te digo que en resumen podr\u00eda decir que The Elite es inesperada. Y ahora, entro en spoilers. Varias situaciones, como lo que ocurre con Marlee y el guardia o el encontronazo que tiene America de Maxon y Celeste me tuvieron tal que as\u00ed: No me esperaba para nada que las situaciones se fuesen a tornar as\u00ed de serias. Para nada. De verdad que lo de Marlee me pill\u00f3 totalmente por sorpresa. Me ol\u00eda que algo iba a pasar, porque no creo que la autora se dejase p\u00e1ginas y p\u00e1ginas para ver lo maravillosa que era esta chica y lo buena amiga de America que era para nada. Y en efecto, cuando se descubre todo el tinglado que ten\u00eda Marlee (que ole ella por liarse con el guardia, eh, que si pasa del culo de Maxon me parece muy normal) me qued\u00e9 de piedra. O sea. Encima con el guardia, del que conocemos c\u00f3mo son las cosas por Aspen. Y buah, el momentazo de America levant\u00e1ndose gritando intentando que todo acabe para ella mientras la azotan. DIOS M\u00cdO. Juro que estaba nervioso perdido. Y que encima luego veamos que Maxon ha ayudado a Marlee por America. AY, MI CORAZ\u00d3N. Otra de las cosas que m\u00e1s me ha sorprendido ha sido sin duda el encontronazo calenturiento de Maxon. Porque no me esperaba PARA NADA que Maxon tuviera el m\u00ednimo inter\u00e9s en Celeste, y menos del tipo sexual, cuando se le ve tan... no s\u00e9, yo no le ve\u00eda en plan as\u00ed. No s\u00e9 si me entend\u00e9is. Y claro, yo estaba superindignado con \u00e9l porque ESO NO SE LE HACE A MI AMERICA. Pero sin embargo, despu\u00e9s, cuando est\u00e1 dando sus explicaciones, quer\u00eda matarlo. S\u00ed, s\u00ed. O sea, cuando est\u00e1n encerrados en la habitaci\u00f3n secreta con el ataque de los rebeldes y Maxon est\u00e1 diciendo que si America no quer\u00eda nada con \u00e9l porque estaba distante, que \u00e9l se iba a arrimar a otras que le dieran tambi\u00e9n lo que necesitaba. Y yo en plan: \u00bfHOLA AL MACHISMO? A punto estuve de cerrar el libro cuando encima veo que America lo acepta. LO ACEPTA. Vale. Yo a todo esto estaba superindignado pero al momento siguiente, America recapacita y se da cuenta de que ella ha hecho exactamente lo mismo con Aspen. Y fue tan zas en toda la boca que me ech\u00e9 a re\u00edr. En efecto, Kiera Cass, eres una diva. No me hab\u00eda dado cuenta del detalle. Se nota que la autora juega con eso de 'qu\u00e9 malo es el hombre que se l\u00eda con otras' pero realmente no ves mal que America lo haga hasta ese momento. O sea, de verdad, no lo hab\u00eda pensado y yo ya culpaba a Maxon. En general, The Elite ha sido una novela que va ganando fuerza y que nos deja las puertas a The One superintensamente abiertas. MADRE M\u00cdA. Las \u00faltimas p\u00e1ginas con el rey amenazando a America y destroz\u00e1ndola. Joder, eres un puto cabr\u00f3n. Y me gustan mucho las criadas y que vayan a organizar una estrategia. Sinceramente, lo que abre esta segunda novela para la tercera es mejor que lo que dej\u00f3 abierto el primero. Eso me gusta; ver esa progresi\u00f3n en una misma trilog\u00eda. Sin duda, The Elite est\u00e1 a la altura de The Selection al no parar de sorprender con tantos giros en la trama (que hay m\u00e1s de los que he comentado, pero esos sin duda, son los que se llevan la palma). ...more (Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.

What do the rebels want? Who will be sent home next? And who will America choose? Beautiful and captivating, this book had me from the very first page! I loved \u2018The Selection\u2019, and I was so excited to finally have a copy of \u2018The Elite\u2019 to read, and I really was not disappointed. America continued to be not only the underdog of the competition, but also the one who truly seemed to have captivated the prince\u2019s heart. Her heart seemed to be in the right place in that she was always doing what seemed right to her, even if the things she did endeared her more to the lower castes than the king. The romance in this book was quite sweet, but I really wanted America to just make a decision and stick with it! It seemed obvious how America and Maxon felt about each other, so the fact that he was off flirting with the other 5 girls in the selection, and she was still making out with Aspen was a bit annoying! I really wanted Maxon to just propose, and send the other girls home instead of them constantly seeming to play games with each others feelings. America also wore something which linked her to Aspen which for me was a really stupid thing to do, and the way she kept asking for more time was irritating too! I have to say that if America and Maxon don\u2019t end up together by the end of this series I will be really annoyed! I liked the storyline in this book, and although America was a little immature and indecisive at times I couldn\u2019t help but love this story. I don\u2019t know what it is about these books but I really love the way they are written, and I actually think that \u2018The Elite\u2019 was better than \u2018The Selection\u2019! Overall; I really loved this book, and although America had her faults, I hated to put this down! Can\u2019t wait for book 3!!! I want it now!!! 9 out of 10. ...more This is going to be a tough review for me, be warned. Last summer I read The Selection and I loved it. I thought the whole idea of a story like this was really original. I loved that it was like The Bachelor put into a dystopian book. I saw a lot of positive reviews about it so I figured it would be positive for me too. So I had to read The Elite also of course and I must say (obviously) I'm rather disappointed by it. Actually a whole lot disappointed. I really wanted to like this book, more so t This is going to be a tough review for me, be warned. Last summer I read The Selection and I loved it. I thought the whole idea of a story like this was really original. I loved that it was like The Bachelor put into a dystopian book. I saw a lot of positive reviews about it so I figured it would be positive for me too. So I had to read The Elite also of course and I must say (obviously) I'm rather disappointed by it. Actually a whole lot disappointed. I really wanted to like this book, more so than some others because The Selection was so good for me. Maybe I had to high hopes but I wanted to enjoy this. The fact that I didn't was a big disappointment because I just wanted this book to be done and over. And that's just never good with any book. I was so frustrated with pretty much everything and every character in The Elite. First of all, America. What was up with her? She kept running back and forth between Maxon and Aspen. It was literally one page she was loving on Maxon and the next she was crawling back to Aspen. Girl, no, just no. The whole book was like this. All about that stupid love triangle. I can like love triangles if they are done well but in this book it has got to be one of the most terrible I've ever read about. And what was up with her decision making? I could hardly follow her train of thought. Doesn't she think at all? At least the one thing that I didn't totally hate was how America was able to read Gregory Illea's diary. What a jackass he was. That's the only thing I want to know more about. Is the diary what the rebels are after or is it something else? I used to love Maxon to bits and pieces but this book ruined him for me. I didn't like him one bit. I guess that The Selection is some sort of game and Maxon has to be sure that he makes the right decision but please, I can't stand the whole thing. Dating all these girls, messing around with him. Ugh! No wonder America got so jealous. And really, Maxon, Celeste? REALLY? The only thing that's not totally awful is that I can sort of understand him a bit, with everything his father (who is a totally pyscho by the way) puts him through he wants distractions but there are other ways. I did feel sorry for what America witnessed at some point... Aspen still is some sort of vague character for me. He wasn't that much in the book but also not totally absent. He did some pretty nice things for America but after what happened to Marlee I can't understand why both him and America would take such huge risks. They are asking to get caught! And no, it doesn't mean that when I'm no longer team Maxon that I'm suddenly team Aspen. I can't pick any teams in this book because they both suck. I'm team America, get the hell out of there and work on yourself, please. The remaining girls in The Selection are definitely on my black list. Especially Kriss. I can't stand her. I get that America messed up and that suddenly Kriss and Maxon got close but it was all so awful to read about. And Celeste, I need her to leave already. There were some rebel attacks again. Wonder what that's about. It's awful but I'd rather read about them attacking the palace and have some action at least than America going back and forth with her two guys. Seriously. But even with the few attacks, we don't know anything. So yeah, frustration everywhere for every character. I was also quite disappointed with the author's writing. And I'm not saying this to bash her or anything. I don't even like giving a book this low a rating because I barely do that. But I couldn't get over it. I didn't like the writing at all. It felt rushed and I can't remember I hated it this much with The Selection. What happened I wondered. I missed action. A lot of them. You'd think because there are rebels, they should've been more of that than there was. Sadly enough it wasn't so. And I really disliked the ending. Literally nothing happened throughout this book. Nothing. I am so disappointed! At least the cover is beautiful and it was a fast read. Overall, The Elite by Kiera Cass was a huge disappointment. Everything from the frustrating characters to the lame plot to the weak writing, it all felt rushed. I wished I had liked it a lot more, but sadly enough I didn't. But I decided I will read the third book once it comes out because I want to know the ending. I hope it won't disappoint me again. ...more -_- I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH.

(*salgangasidlgfhgadsflaihgksdfasdsdf) This is going to be a full on rant. And some of you might think I'm crazy, or way too picky, or an \"angry person whose head explodes like a volcano just from reading a book\", but AYE. DON. CARE. AYE DON CARE. (Get it?) I read the author's about me and acknowledgements. She seems COOL. She has spunk, she's out there, she's just . . . SPUNKY! And I love spunky. But this lady, who's spunk I admire, happened to write a book that I can say IS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. EVER. And no. I've never read Twilight by Stephanie Meyer. I was un fortunate enough to read Blue Moon by Alyson Noel, which was a big load of doodoo, and this book and that one TIE UP PERFECTLY IN HORRIBLENESS. Welcome to the fo-shizzle shelf, you misfitted book. So if you're a fellow review reader who LOVED this book, you're probably sitting there thinking, \"Wow. Theresa's review for today is gonna suck because I TOTALLY DISAGREE, THIS BOOK IS AH-MAY-ZING.\" and that's okay! But you can never get me to ever think this book was gem. It was \"bloody awful\". Compared to a gem, this book was merely loose change, and I'm really, really disappointed. REASONS THIS BOOK EARNED THAT ONE SPARKLY STAR: Because it wasn't a \"zero-star\" book, it was a ONE STAR. It earned that one star. Why? Because in my opinion, this writing is really, really not that bad. THE WRITING, not the story. The story . . . . well, we'll get on to that in a second. But the WRITING was okay. It wasn't overly detailed, like \"My mouth slowly turned into a curl as I gently pressed the greasy keys of my computer's keyboard. I sighed and tediously fluffed my hair as I typed, 'My mouth slowly turned into a curl as I gently pressed the greasy keys . . .'\" IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. It had a pretty good flow going. So WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED???!! (*Ahem) Well, I should mention this one really whacko sentence that made me sort of snort. I don't know what page it was on. But America was describing Maxon, and she said, and I quote: \"He launched himself into a run.\" ....He launched himself. He LAUNCHED himself. Not to tease or taunt but that sentence made me picture him with rockets under his shoes like Astro Boy. Reasons why this book flew across the room (as in . . . . . I chucked it. FOR REAL.) 1. Love triangle. This was the worst . . . the worst love triangle ever. Even worse than the human-vampire-werewolf one that I assume everyone knows. It was. THE WORST. And I'm not trying to be mean when I say worst, but it just made me so angry and frustrated. America Singer was emitted into the Selection to compete for a guy. Prince Maxon Shubalubadoo (forgot his last name but remembered it started with an S) is the prince. Aspen is the first boyfriend of America. AFTER TWO GUYS AT A TIME?! America, you horndog. NO! NO NO NO MAXON IS THE HORNDOG HERE. (But I will get to that in a second.) But get this. In book one, Aspen freaking breaks up with America because America is in caste 5, and he's a caste lower than she is, so that would only bring her down. AND because she's going to the Selection for the prince. That is effing stupid. YOU DON'T JUST GIVE UP THE GIRL YOU LOVE FOR THAT! Just because she's going to the Selection?! 35 freaking girls, THERE'S A CHANCE SHE WON'T WIN! It just made me so mad how he could give her up like that. Then this (sasjflasijgadfslsadf) shows up at the castle as a guard. TO MADE THE BOOK MORE DRAMATIC, OOH. LA. LA. But apparently this guy still. loves. America. SO WHY DID YOU LET HER GO IN THE FIRST PLACE, YOU TURD?! Maxon. In the first book, I thought he was alright. But then I realized why I do not like \"The Bachelor\" the show. It's like he's dating a bunch of girls at once! He could be kissing all of them! He goes and tells America \"I will choose you, I will choose you. ONLY IF YOU WANT ME TO CHOOSE YOU, my dear!\" Hah. Let's just read and see what he REALLY does. You see, I didn't mind Maxon for a while . . . until he literally started crushing on one of the other girls. (JEEZ, I hope I didn't spoil anyone there . . .) YOU LIED TO AMERICA, you turd-in-a-bucket. YOU. LIED. TO. HER. HOW. DARE. YOU!!!! Even though I think America is . . . . . . a pretty big ditz, I STILL HATE HOW HE CHANGED HIS MIND LIKE THIS. He didn't keep his word. He didn't. Keep. His. Word. \"Oh, my dear America, I only want you!\" That's not a good example of a lover! WHAT THE HECK?! It would have made more sense if America noticed that and used it as a factor of elimination in her should-I-choose-Maxon-or-Aspen contest, but America didn't notice a thing. She was stupid enough to still keep him in the running for her HERO. Through the book I was BEGGING this girl to just see Maxon's B.S. YOU SHOULD BE WITH SOMEONE WHO ONLY WANTS YOU! Who only wants you? Maxon has to make a choice. LOOK AT FREAKING ASPEN! He's freaking waiting for you. You've been together for 2 years. YOU HAVE MEMORIES. To top that all off, you don't have to struggle with being a princess! (Which I should mention, in the story, America almost decides not to stay in The Selection because she thinks she's not fit for a princess. OH-KAY, FINE! Go to Aspen then! He's STANDING RIGHT--OVER--THERE!!! *rips hair off of head in pure and utter frustration.) I mean obviously she and Aspen still love each other, even though Aspen is still a dummy for dumping her in the first place. (This all wouldn't have happened if it weren't for you, Aspen. THANKS. THANKS A LOT.) I might just seem like one of those fangirls who are raging because I'm on \"Team Aspen\" or whatever. NO. I'M NOT ON ANY TEAM! I want to smack Aspen as much as I want to smack America and Maxon ALL TOGETHER. So 2. America was frustratingly, irritatingly, hair-pulling-out-ingly STUPID. What does this teach the reader, huh? That's what I think books are all about. THEIR LIFE LESSONS IN THE STORY. America is struggling between choosing a guy she's been in love with for 2 years and a prince who's \"dating\" 5 other girls besides her! WHICH ONE SHALL SHE CHOOSE! You know what? You know what? (*growls) Aspen, just go find another girl. There was this quote in this very book, I SWEAR, and I forgot what page it was on. But Aspen says to America something along the lines of: \"I know I'm smart. Because I am smart enough not to fall for a stupid girl.\" Are you smart, Aspen? ARE YOU? REALLY? Hmm. I plead to concur! 3. What kind of love lesson does this story teach?! The three of them are all practically cheating on each other. America. You are cheating on Aspen with Maxon. America. You are also cheating on Maxon with Aspen. (AND BEHIND HIS BACK! Oh my my my.) AMERICA. You alternate kissing one and the other through the pages. HOW DO YOU NOT FEEL THE GUILT INSIDE YOU! (Sorry, guys, I just really, really, really hate cheating. And I always feel uncomfortable when someone likes 2 people at once. DID YOU KNOW if you want 2 people, you actually want neither of them? LET ME EXPLAIN. Lets pretend you are choosing between PRINCE A and PRINCE B. Prince A doesn't have feelings for you. But Prince B does. So you tag along with Prince B and say \"Okay! I'll just choose Prince B!\" and you're all dandy and fine! UNLESS YOU LIKE PRINCE A BETTER THAN PRINCE B. If that is the case, you should say you like Prince A. Because nothing, I repeat NOTHING is crueller than dating a person when you like someone else more. NOTHING IS CRUELLER than making someone a \"plan B\" or a \"Safety net in case you get dumped by the first guy\".) So America likes both of these guys at the same time. HOW. I don't know how you can love two people EXACTLY THE SAME. There must be one of them that you love more, and you have to figure that out. BUT WHY WHY WHY DO YOU IGNORE HOW THEY TREAT YOU?! Why do you take so long to choose when it's obvious who you SHOULD choose: the guy you've been in love with LONGER or this newer guy you just met because of a COMPETITION that's also been dating 34 other girls? HUH?! HUH, AMERICA?! Or maybe . . . maybe it's the kind of story that follows after \"You can't be in love with 2 guys. Because if you were really in love with the first guy, you wouldn't have fallen for the second.\" UGH. Confusing. So so confusing now. I dunno. I'm not capable of liking two people at once, because once I am really in love with someone, it's impossible to see anyone else that could possibly be better than him. That's what falling in love means, isn't it? So have you guys ever heard of the youtube series, \"How It Should Have Ended\". GO WATCH THEM. NOW! I'll freaking give a link to their channel! WATCH THESE!! The Selection: The Elite should be made into one of these. Because I'm not trying to rewrite the story or anything, but think of it like HISHEdotcom would. HOW THE SELECTION SHOULD HAVE ENDED: Aspen: \"America . . . . America, I came all the way from (wherever we live) to see you . . . . to tell you how much I love you. I'm still here, baby . . . I'm still here. I still love you so much.\" America: \"But . . . you dumped me.\" Aspen: \"It was a mistake, America.\" America: \"I've found someone new though.\" Aspen: \"I would never choose anyone over you, America! NEVER!\" Maxon: \"I like you America. AND I like this one other girl, too, AT THE SAME TIME. Just like how you like that lonely guard over there AND ME at the same time! Perhaps you deserve that!\" *wink wink* America: \"Wait a minute . . . . Maxon, you told me you only wanted me.\" Maxon: \"It's a competition! ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN! It's like the Bachelor, REMEMBER?\" America: \"Oh . . . that's right.\" Maxon: \"Besides, you're not the only girl I've kissed, you know.\" Aspen: \"You're the only girl I've kissed America! I love you! Come back with me! Let's be together, I CAME ALL THIS WAY. JUST FOR YOU. I AM HERE FOR YOU!\" Maxon: \"You'll have a chance at my kingdom if you stay with me.\" America: \" . . . Wait a minute. This is a love story. It's supposed to teach the readers SOMETHING ABOUT LOVE. Love doesn't care about kingdoms. Love doesn't care about being the highest caste, or being princess, or marrying a beautiful prince. Love is about being there for someone, someone being there for you. Love is about ONE OTHER PERSON that makes you feel like your heart is going to burst--JUST ONE OTHER PERSON. Love shouldn't have to compete. Love should be solid and obvious. Aspen, you and I have loved each other for so long. Maxon, I don't have that history with you, and besides, you like someone else. How can you truly love me . . . if you love someone else at the same time? Aspen . . . I realize who really loves me.\" Aspen: \"Really?\" America: \"I choose you Aspen! Let us have a happy ending together! SPARE THE READERS A BOOK #3!!\" (Aspen and America flip off Maxon together, and then they link arms and skip into the sunset.) OR it can happen like this: ALTERNATE ENDING Aspen: \" . . . I'M HERE FOR YOU!\" Maxon: \"You'll have a chance at my kingdom if you stay with me.\" America: \"Wait a minute . . . this is a love story. It's supposed to teach the readers something about LOVE . . . . . . . . . Aspen, you dumped me for a stupid reason! Maxon, you like another girl at the same time as me! None of you truly treat me like a princess! I'll find another prince ON. MY.

OFFICIAL REVIEW: (Short but sweet probably utterly mindboggling .) Our story began in The Selection when 35 girls moved to the palace hoping to someday marry Prince Maxon; however, by the beginning of The Elite , only 6 girls remain. For our dear America, this means only five girls left to compete with. Natalie, Elise, Celeste, Kriss and Marlee. Only 5 other girls, and Maxon has already expressed his feelings for America. Should be a piece of cake. Right? Well, America is in for surprise because everyone's upping their game, and this time she's not the only one with a secret. I'm not going to lie, whilst reading The Elite you'll probably develop a deep, deep hatred for some of the characters, America included. I wish I could say you wouldn't, but I think you will. I did. Then again, maybe I'm just a complete bitch. Seriously though, there were times when I was practically in tears because of hate I felt growing inside of me. Some revelations will bring you to tears, other's will make you want to kill. You'll probably find the storyline predictable and you'll probably hate yourself at some point for predicting some of the most important aspects of the novel. I know I did. Then again, maybe I'm just way too self-loathing. You'll probably not put the book down until you finish it, and then realize you had a million other things to do. Which is what happened to me. Then again, maybe I'm just a complete procrastinator. But, one thing I can say for sure is that holymotheroffluffykitteneverywhere! The Elite will sweep you off your feet and leave you wanting more. Then again, maybe I'm just way too in love with Maxon to see clearly. I screamed, cried and probably lost all hope at ever being normal whilst reading The Elite . And you know what? I LOVED IT.

I won't make a good queen. Actually, I could make a different. Oh wait, I just did something stupid. Speaking of stupid, America's irrationality was a bit too much. I know her heart, though she won't admit it, is now at stake, but she pulled herself together after Aspen. Sometimes strong emotions can get the best of us, but I had expected so much more from her. One or two things, fine. But she made me so mad throughout the entire book. 2. What happened to the plot? The first book was more about the competition and the gradual elimination process. In this book, the first elimination was a given that you could guessed way ahead of time from book 1. The only other one was just more a default kind thrown in there - you're staying so let's get rid of her instead. I wasn't drawn to the individual missions or tasks they had to do because contestants weren't eliminated as a result of how well they did. 3. I found it interesting that this book takes place in the future (after the fourth world war, right?), and Cass throws out concepts that are well-established in our society to give the girls individuality - like equal rights, or a drafted military, or even better yet, women in the military. I understand that a lot has changed, and some of that means going backwards in politics, but I just found the attempts annoying, especially since they were just tossed in there, glimpsed over and then left to flounder. Come on! Throw in some originality or just leave those comments out. By the way, did you know there's a sort-of revolution going on? North rebels? South rebels? Huh? Oh, I was too focused on being pissed off at America. The only reason I did not give this book 1 star is because I actually liked the end. (view spoiler) [For what it's worth, it looks like the America I liked from book 1 has found herself and may be truly back for good. Also, there's going to be no more of this wishy-washy bullshit - well at least not from America's end. What makes it worse was Cass didn't even try to make Aspen as alluring as he was in book 1. I mean, it wasn't even a contest. She just wasn't ready to let go. AND, the tables have now turned. America is no longer in control of the situation - which she did a pretty crappy job handling - and it's now HIS game. Two things I have to say about this: good for him, and it's about time. (hide spoiler) ] I'll read book 3 because it's the last book, but I really hope this was just a \"middle book\" or I will be so disappointed with this series. ...more America hayat\u0131mda okudu\u011fum en sinir bozucu karakterlerden biri.

I've taken a few days to think and I discussed with the lovely Kassiah and have come to the conclusion that I'm torn on what to rate this book. The problem I'm having here is that for whatever reason I can't look away. I hated the characters, and I hated the very slim and almost non-existent plot of this book... yet I read it in a day and I didn't want to put it down. What the heck is a girl supposed to do with that? So in The Elite, we are still hanging out with Prince Maxon - America has made the cut and is in the final six. Maxon is doing all he can to convince America that she's who he wants... all while dating 5 other girls. I mean, you've all seen The Bachelor and any other of those irritating dating shows right? That's this. In book form and the dude is a prince. Let's start with the plot. I mean, what there is of it. I swear 80% of this book is spent going back in forth in America's mind on whether she can handle being a princess and whether she loves Maxon or whether she loves Aspen. I'm pretty sure at around 30% I wanted to choke her out. The girl couldn't make a decision to save her own damn life, which I get sort of... she's a teenager trying to make an adult decision. I mean there she was at the end of The Selection saying she needed to do this for her and choose for herself... THEN MAKE A GOD DAMN DECISION. She would see Aspen and she'd be all \"ohhhhh I still love you.\" and then she'd see Maxon and be telling him she wanted to be there and not to give up on her she just needs time. You've had ALL of book 2 now... make your damn decision already. And to be perfectly honest, at this point in the game, if you're still playing I just don't think you should even be considering Aspen. He almost seems like the ideal back-up plan for her because if she doesn't win she can always fall back on him. I don't like that she expects him to wait in the wings while she does all the things with Maxon and then gets jealous when Aspen is talking with another girl. You can't have everything America. So yeah. I was irritated with her. But I was also irritated with Maxon. Yeah I know... hold on for this. The dude has spent all this time trying to convince America that she's the one for him and when he finally does, suddenly he becomes distant. WHUT?? And the excuses ... I just wasn't buying it. I mean I get that this is a competition, but honestly, I might have bought this reaction earlier in book 1 where he was meant to get to know all the girls, but at this point he has the field narrowed to 6 and he's still kind of playing them all??? THAT DOES NOT MAKE A SWOONY BOY!! I get it. I truly do. I know that he wasn't feeling secure in America's feelings for him, but instead of giving her MORE reason to question them, maybe ... I don't know... try allaying them instead of adding fuel to the fire. yes yes yes... I know that wouldn't have made a book 3 possible right? Okay... aside from the 80% of America being all wishy-washy, the other time is spent on the girls doing tasks to show they could succeed at being the princess and hiding in secret rooms from the rebels who seem to be searching the castle for something and leaving cryptic messages all over the walls after an attack. You guys... I'm making it sound like I didn't like this and that's not true. It's really not. I'm seriously torn here, because like I said, I couldn't look away, and at one point told a friend that I hated every single character in this book yet I kept going. I'm invested. I want to see if America finally gets her head out of her ass and decides which boy she loves more and I want to know what those damn rebels want. I think what Cass did well here was show that even in the throes of competition women don't have to go for the throat. America was able to develop some wonderful friendships despite the competition and we also get to see bits and pieces of her relationship with her father, which I think were really well done. His love and support for her even if she isn't chosen really shows the true bond of family and it's definitely something rare in YA books. I mean in all honesty, America is only seventeen and that's a point in your life when you need that support. Cass even gives us a bit more information on the creation of Ilea and the development of the castes. I'm not sure it was developed enough, but it was there, and I'm not even sure I like how it was done... i.e. reading through the former rulers personal diary. But it was enlightening for sure. So there... I'm not sure what to tell you here. I was frustrated with the true lack of a plot and any movement forward with the story. The story here felt very static and there was only one elimination, which wasn't even really a true elimination. I think by this point we should have the field narrowed down a bit more but ... that's just me. It will be interesting to see how Cass wraps up this series. I imagine the final book will be filled with everything seeing as how this book wasn't filled with much of anything. AND YES. I'll be reading book three even if I end up hating everyone in it. If you're a fan of The Bachelor or any of those other drama filled reality shows, you might just love this series. Though keep in mind, book 1 has a bit more action and drama than this one does. Meanwhile, I'll be waiting around for book 3 like everyone else and shaking my fist at Cass because... I can't quit your series. Even if I hate everyone in it.

Even things that seemed a little likable turned out to be fails as the romance is like a disease, it spreads everywhere and it's unstoppable. Picking from where we left off, America Singer is part of the Elite, where there are still six girls fighting to win Prince Maxon's heart. They marry Maxon then they get everything- the crown, being a One, the country. Even though Maxon clearly has declared his love for America, she still is in a tough situation as her ex-boyfriend is following her every move. Stuck between the two, America also faces the rebel attacks penetrating the palace. Actually, forget that last sentence as it doesn't really matter. The rebel attacks were so minute and monotonous and stirred only the tiniest of complications in The Elite. One day, when all literary characters come to life, I will track down America and pulverise her. While her love for her family and friends is strong, her indecision and possessiveness wanted me to rip my hair out. Here are just some examples: I looked away. That wasn't something I could promise. I weighed Maxon and Aspen in my heart over and over, and neither of them ever had a true edge. Except, maybe, when I was alone with one of them. and But how was I supposed to decide between two good possibilities? How could I make a choice that would leave some part of me devastated either way? I comforted myself with the thought that I still had time. I still had time. I mean gosh America, not everything revolves around you and your stupidity. You can't love two people with so much angst towards both of them. Here's a few examples of her possessiveness towards both Maxon and Aspen: Maybe if Maxon here already it wouldn't be so bad. Then again, maybe it would make me more anxious. I still couldn't figure out why, after everything, he hadn't made any time for me lately. and (this was when Aspen asked Celeste for a dance as it was a Halloween party) \"What the hell was that?\" I asked quietly but with obvious outrage in my voice. \"What was what?\" [Aspen] \"Celeste was running her hands all over you!\" Uh no, America, Aspen and Celeste just danced like you did with Officer Woodwork. Bloody hell. America also has a habit of crying. All the freaking time. When the tiniest thing goes bad. When she overthinks. And when she's not crying she's giggling like she has some sort of disorder. Guys, she's worse than Taylor Swift and me. Moreover, the supporting characters were no better. Despite the fact that they're unique and contrasted. They were absolutely revolting. Here is an indirect quote: Kriss: I want to have seven bridesmaids at my wedding. I want to have a big wedding if Maxon chooses me. Celeste: I won't want to have bridesmaids. Since it would be televised, I want all eyes on me. Me: I want a gun at my wedding so I can kill you all. The Elite pretty much was uneventful. You can skip this one and read the next one and not even feel like you've missed out on anything. The plot was invisible. The world building was underwhelming. The romance was just too horrible for words. So move on people! Don't waste your time with this one. ...more I'm not going to lie I loved this book!!

When America entered she never imaged to be there longer than a week never mind make it to The Elite - one of the final six girls left in the competition. Yet America is at war with herself debating if she wants the life of a princess along with all the responsibilities or to go back to living in the castes with her family. Does she love Maxon or does Aspen still have her heart? I know who has my heart *wink wink*. I read The Selection and within minutes, I was deep in The Elite drinking it in with my eyes until I was word drunk and I mean the kind of drunk where you are completely in love and are ready to devote your life to a fictional character... then get sectioned. The story had me gripped from the beginning and I felt every little bump and heartache along the way. I couldn't make my mind up, was I team Maxon or team Aspen?! Oh for the love of god SOMEONE STOP ME FROM TAKING A HEART ATTACK! America is like a fish out of water, she can't make her mind up about anything yet I still felt every emotion with her. After I had read so many bad opinions about her I thought I was going to hate her but I started to root for her and wanted her to get the guy which is unusual for me. The only part I didn't like was how flighty she was, I'm sure she's a tad bipolar because the girl can be pretty cray cray. Maxon once again won me over and over, yeah at points I was completely gobsmacked with his action (Celest? Oh my god! and Kirss GAH I HATE HER) but he has never had the chance to be with a girl before and I could understand his reason behind everything. With the whole Halloween that he did for America... yeah amazing! He is so thoughtful and I know I say this all the time but he is definitely my new favourite book boyfriend and if I could marry him I would... can I? I never like to go into too much detail about a plot or what happens between characters because I believe it ruins the book for people, all I want to do is let you know my thoughts on it and who is my favourite as I believe books are there to be read, not to be spoiled by others.

I was very disappointed in that \"The Elite\" seemed to cater to its very young readers focusing on a 'he loves me, he loves me not' love story that was quite artificial. The plot was reduced wholly to America's misunderstandings of other's intentions, childish, selfish, and naive misunderstandings to which only those of a very young readers group could possibly relate, and her very foolish reactions to those misunderstandings. I couldn't believe the number of rhetorical questions America asks, without any answers offered. From chapter four and continued throughout the whole novel... It was impossible. I had to choose. Aspen or Maxon. But how was I supposed to decide between two good possibilities? How could I make a choice that would leave some part of me devastated either way? I comforted myself with the thought that I still had time. I still had time. Cynic warning--the only reason she has or even needs time is to sell more books. While in \"The Selection\" the story was interesting enough to keep me captivated and to see past the cliched and generally non-dimensional plot construction, \"The Elite\", if it was possible, becomes even more cliched and even less original. In short, it seems that it was fully a money-making filler to extend a simple series. I have no doubt that anyone could skip this book in its entirety and pick up the third without missing a step. Of course, I'm stubborn and have been sucked into the trashy love-triangle, so I will read the third (hence why I said this book was \"OK\" rather than I hated it), but I was still scratching my head wondering if there were any other redeeming qualities to reading it besides my innate curiosity of how the story finishes. There aren't. ...more read in one sitting. TEAM MAXON BABY!!", "Title": "The Elite"},
