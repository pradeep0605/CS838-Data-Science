But what really sucks is that Sparks seems to have a very soft spot for soldiers since 9/11. So, talking of boring clich\u00e9s, the protagonist was a brave soldier fighting for his country in Iraq. *doubleyawn* I will never understand the American idealism about their soldiers. (And please, any people reading this, don't feel obliged to lecture me on that...) So, my conclusion, I will never ever read a Sparks again. The book before that was already a disappointment, but I thought I should give him another chance. Huge mistake, one I certainly won't repeat. ...more ''I'm not sure what I should put for an address.

Nicholas Sparks has his reputation of writing the most popular and some quite beautiful/original love stories. Of course, <+++>The Lucky One</+++> was no exception. There were some elements I was annoyed about because they seemed too similar to his other books but, in general, it was a very nice read. For example, Beth\u2019s little 10 years old boy, Ben, reminded me A LOT of the other nice little boy in The Last Song (and I'm really not talking about in the movie but in the book) which, if you haven\u2019t read it, is a wonderful book. Also, the marines, army. \u00ab---- Dear John! At least, Thibault doesn\u2019t have the same personality as John so it\u2019s wasn\u2019t like I saw him instead of Thibault while reading. The pacing is very slow. Beth and Thibault are actually meeting each other after about 65 pages only, but the fact is that those pages were kind of long. There were many descriptions and psychological thinking when I wanted more dialogs and well\u2026 romance. Although, as we all know, Nicholas Sparks likes to write about the characters background and really want to make us connect in a way to them so, yeah, many descriptions. At first, it bored me but, after those 65 pages, it all goes well and the reading begins to feel nice and enjoyable. Beth is a good girl, someone I actually related to because she didn't date many guys or slept with many either. She was married to a man that she divorced off because, let\u2019s face it, he was not the good, stable kind of man, especially as a husband and dad because they did have a kid together. I\u2019ll say it and it\u2019s true, he\u2019s a pervert. The type of pervert that takes pictures of naked woman whenever he gets the chance to, when he is in reality a police officer! He\u2019s one of those persons that make you think, what is wrong with the world and how could some adult do that?! There is no need for me to say it obviously, but I hate that guy (named Clayton.) Thibault is sweet! And funny, easygoing, calm. The perfect man. The problem is\u2026he\u2019s just too nice. He is perfect but perfect doesn\u2019t exist in reality (for me) and I couldn\u2019t believe in him as much as I wanted to. He was likeable, yes, and a great character, yes, but this contemporary was just so\u2026unrealitic to me. Like, how could this possibly happen? How could someone, in the army, find a picture with a woman which becames his lucky charm and he decides to find (and will find) that woman in question. Plus, that the woman in question is single... It could, maybe, but I can't/don't believe it. I enjoyed reading it though and will keep reading other books by Nicholas Sparks because they\u2019re cute and bring different emotions out of me. Though it is not my favourite (Dear John is for now.) The romance is wonderful, as always. I would recommend this book but, if you have the choice between let\u2019s say\u2026The Last Song, Dear John and The Lucky One, in your place, I would personally choose Dear John then, The Last Song, and then The Lucky One.

Here we are given a story with a slightly darker edge and far more suspense then his usual soppy romance. Dog lovers and fans of The Guardian in particular will appreciate this engaging romantic suspense. One of the great (or not so great) things about Nicholas Sparks is that he doesn\u2019t always give you a happy ending and it was with this in mind that about half way through -just as the flood waters started to rise, secrets began boiling to the surface and I was completely invested in the characters and their budding love story, I began to get nervous for the ending. I mean you just knew something bad was going to happen, the clues were all there but the real question that kept me turning pages at a frantic pace was\u2026 to who? Each chapter here has been written from a different characters POV incorporating Elizabeth; a divorced mother with a young son who along with her no-nonsense Nana run a dog kennel in their small North Carolina town, Clayton her ex-husband and the town sheriff (bully) comes from a influential family yet harbours some nasty little secrets. Iraq war veteran, <---C>Logan Thibault</---C> is our hero and alongside his dog Zeus has walked (yes walked) from Colorado in an obsessive search for the unknown woman from a photograph he found during his three harrowing tours of duty in Iraq. He believes the picture to be his good luck charm and directly responsible for keeping him alive. In the end all the characters merge for a predictable yet ultimately nail-biting ending. The last chapter is very, very sneaky with Sparks keeping you on pins for pages before finally giving up the ending of which I had no clue. I fell in love with all of these well fleshed out characters, each coming with rich personalities and history including several flashbacks. The love story is well done and as I said before not too soppy. Thibault is a quiet, tortured hero and just so damn lovely with Beth perfect as his caring yet tough partner. The antagonist is creepy and also well written yet because of who he is you can\u2019t really wish him dead. Sheesh, I even fell for the boy and the dog. So yeah, I highly recommend another Nicholas Sparks novel. ...more A typical NS book, which seems like a gender-reversal of \"Message in a Bottle\". It was an easy escape read, and the characters are all well developed. I actually hated reading the chapters on Clayton! What a creep! I love Zeus, who had a great handle on character reading! Almost feel that NS is becoming a bit Danielle Steeleish in his writing...formula, token sex, surprise of who died/lived. All in all...not a bad book for a cold weekend! I picked up this book because I'd seen the movie preview and thought that I should really read it before watching it. Problem is, I have a real love/hate relationship with Nicholas Sparks. I'm a happy ending kind of a girl. I read books to escape the sadness, drama and sometimes craziness of life. I swear, every other time I read a Sparks book I swear I'll never read another.

I don't like it when people find true love and then one of them dies or does something stupid so they're ripped apart forever (Dear John anyone?. How much did that blow?!!) Plus, that's not even that realistic because I know very few people that has happened to. Anyway, on with the review. . . SPOILER ALERT: I did a little research and determined that this one might be a safe one to try. I held my breath through a good portion of the book, but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but at least it wasn't sad. As I was reading reviews I saw a lot of people complaining that this book was very stereotypical. Pretty, perfect people, a villian you love to hate. Well, that's probably true, but those are the books Sparks writes and most people like him for that. Like I said, some like to escape the reality of life a little. Overall, the book was a lot of fun. I had a hard time putting it down. I loved the love story of it. One of Nicholas Spark's better stories. ...more Nicholas Sparks is not a good writer. His dialogue is completely flat, and it doesn't help when he throws in comments such as \"he liked her wit\" when nothing at all witty had been said. I can only imagine he is working toward a certain word count when he describes every step of making tacos and homemade ice cream. I've heard that he disdains the label of romance author for himself, but most romance authors I read can write circles around him. This wasn't one of my absolute favorites--just okay. I have read several Nicholas Sparks novels and I put this one in the category of \"True Believer\" and its sequel, \"At First Sight\". By now the author pretty much has a formula which he follows in most of his books: always set it his home state of North Carolina, there is always a storm where the plot twists and/or reaches its climax, someone usually dies, and the couples always fall in love and end up in bed--usually, boring, uninteresting sex e This wasn't one of my absolute favorites--just okay.

This 14th novel is no different. Logan Thibault is an ex-marine in search of a woman whose photo he's been carrying for the past five years. He found it in the sand in Iraq and ever since he has carried it, he has felt lucky. It has helped him win big at poker games, and kept him alive in situations that, by all accounts, should have ended his life. His friend, Victor tells him he has a debt to pay to the woman in the photo as it has proved to be a lucky charm. When tragedy strikes, Logan follows his friend's advice and sets out on foot, with his dog, Zeus, from Colorado to North Carolina, stopping along the way to seek information about E.--the only letter of the woman's name found on the back of the photo. Upon entering Hampton County, Logan has a run in with the local sherrif who doesn't like the looks of him or of his German shepard. This sherrif later on becomes a big player in this story as he interferes in Thibault's life and plans. Here is where the action begins. Of course, Thibault finds the woman in the photograph and what usually happens in Sparks novels happens, but the story lacked the passion found in \"The Notebook\" and \"Nights in Rodanthe\". I don't feel like Sparks ever really peels back enough of the layers that make up these characters. I never get to know them as well as I should. A lot of his stories are just on the surface--and once in a while he ends up with a winner like the two previously mentioned books. For the most part though, his books are airport novels--an appropriate read to pass the time but it doesn't stay with you. I have found that to be the biggest disappointment with most of his books. NONE of them are keepers. Here is another one for the donation pile. ...more Whenever I go to read a Nicholas Sparks book my first (and usually only) question to anyone who has read it is \"Am I going to cry?\" I ask this because in many of Spark's novels the main character dies in the end often in a tragic way. Since, I now want fun books with happy endings, it breaks my heart when this happens. However, Sparks has such a rich and inviting writing style that even with these reoccurring tragic endings, I can't help but fall in love with any and all of his books.

However, Sparks has such a rich and inviting writing style that even with these reoccurring tragic endings, I can't help but fall in love with any and all of his books. The characters come alive and the love stories are magical, yet real at time. \"The Lucky One\" is no different. It is a beautiful story with strong, animated characters. Logan Thibault is one of my favorite characters in literature. He is Veteran of the U.S. Marines and a quiet, confident man who is looking for his destiny. He finds it in Elizabeth, a single mom living in her hometown of Hampton, NC. Their story is beautiful and a delight to read. Once I started \"The Lucky One\" I did not want to put it down. The story is compelling and sweet. Sparks is at his best when writing this novel. And to answer the question of whether I cried...I did not. At least, there were no sad tears. But it is a story that stays with you, in a good way. I give \"The Lucky One\" five out of five stars. I love this novel and if you are a fan of Sparks' work or love stories in general then this is a novel for you. ...more Okay, so this book followed my reading of The Story of Edgar Sawtelle . After that great work of literature, anything would pale, probably. Maybe I'm not being fair, but I really just didn't care for Sparks' latest. I've only read a few of his books, but already I'm seeing a pattern and I found myself getting bored and saying, \"Awe, come on,\" throughout.

That's how I'd describe it. Trite and that it left me feeling let-down. That being said, I read the book in a day....I kept wanting to be done with it and get it over with. While it was a rather harmless, quick-read romance, (which I like at times), I don't think I'll read another of Sparks' books. Too bad. I had liked previous books by him. He's gotta do better than this, though. Oh, and it kind of bugs me that he puts a full-blown photo of himself on the back cover of the book. What's that all about? I felt like I had to turn the book over so I didn't see him staring up at me whenever I set it down. Annoying. My husband is better-looking by far. I should have taped a picture of him on the book :). Maybe I'm too harsh, but that's my sum-up of this one. ...more I found The Lucky One, by Nicholas Sparks, captivating.

Nicholas Sparks has also had four of his novels adapted into major motion pictures including: Message in a Bottle, The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe. Nicholas Sparks resides in North Carolina with his wife and family. While in his third tour of duty in Iraq, U.S. Marine Logan Thibault happens upon a half-buried photograph of a beautiful young woman, simply known as E. After no one has claimed it, Logan finds himself drawn to it and carrying it in his pocket wherever he goes. More importantly, he discovers it brings him luck. His friend, Victor, seems to think it was his fate to find it and calls it his lucky charm. Once he is back home in Colorado, Logan can\u2019t seem to get the woman out of his mind. Understanding just how crazy it was, he sets forth on foot from Colorado to North Carolina in search of what very well may be his destiny. He didn\u2019t have any illusions of what might await him, but he sure wasn\u2019t expecting the instant attraction to Elizabeth, the sincere fondness for her Nana, the friction with her ex, Clayton, or to fall immediately in love with her ten-year-old son, Ben. Pursuing the path he chose and attraction for Beth, they ignite a passionate affair of the heart, never knowing that the secret of how he came about the photo could destroy everything he had waited his entire life to find. True to form, and with a power-house ending, it\u2019s no secret why Nicholas Sparks has captivated readers worldwide for some time now. How rare it is to find a man who can craft a story in this genre with so much insight in the human condition, affairs of the heart, the importance of family- and to do it in a manner that always seems new and unique. I find that to be the best part of this author, that when he has you crying, laughing, or ready to spit nails, he has the power to make you believe that anything is possible- that fate and destiny are not myths, after all. (Insert sigh here), Another great read from a true gem in this genre. The Lucky One, by Nicholas Sparks, is an engaging, charming, and witty tale, determined to restore your faith in happily ever after again.

In. What. Time? Let's be a little realistic, shall we? Yet every time we see her in the book, she's just hanging out on the porch. Yeah. Right. Then there's Logan, who only exists in someone's imagination. A man who is that perfect does not live. He's a pianist. A violinist. Has a degree in Anthropology. Fixes cars. Trains animals. Is a war hero. Survived ELEVEN bombings in Iraq. Plays chess, makes kites out of garbage bags and straws like MacGuyver, is a prolific reader, WALKED from Colorado to North Carolina, has a bottomless wallet of cash only... it's just crazy. Then there's fun little stupid things like when Nicholas Sparks has Elizabeth planting thousands of tulips and daffodils every spring, so they can come up after the azaleas. Um... tulips and daffodils are PERENNIALS... they come up every year, you don't have to re-plant, Nick... and tulips are the FIRST things that come up, along with crocus and daffodils. The man drives me crazy. And I'm not even sure I want to see the movie. The book says Logan got a degree in anthropology, has done three tours of duty as a Marine in Iraq, has 'wild' hair and a vagabond appearance and \"doesn't look like a college student\"... and they cast Zac Ephron? You have GOT to be kidding me. And yet all of his books become movies. I don't get it. ...more At least this one has a happy ending...

Then, I saw the list: The Notebook, Nights in Rodanthe, A Walk to Remember.....good grief, how did I miss this when I made my purchase? It should be noted that while I enjoy a good romance as much as the next girl, I try VERY hard to avoid cheese. (Except Twilight. I'll admit it; I read that series.) In fact, I was once forced by my little sister to watch the movie, The Notebook, and I have never laughed so hard in my life. Or felt so ashamed. But, I digress... Not only is the story cheesy, but Mr. Sparks seems to follow a cookie cutter pattern for his books, as well. Admittedly, I haven't read any of his other books, but enough of them have been made into movies that I've picked up the general gist. Let me see if I can predict his next book, shall we??? Emotionally unavailable, slightly damaged male figure meets super sweet heroine that's probably had a few hard knocks (divorce, a death, single motherhood, whatever) in life and together they overcome some epic drama that leads them to the meaning of love. Sometimes it ends on a happily-ever-after note; sometimes one of them dies. Vomit. To all of you who enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books, I'm sorry. Really. ...more I'm not going to lie: I read this book because I wanted to watch the film and I wanted to watch the film because Zac Efron is in it and I wanted to stare at Zac Efron for 90 minutes because I am shallow.

Well, I enjoyed this book. Between reading the blurb and seeing the trailer for the film, I knew exactly what I was in for and it delivered it well. I loved Zeus and Ben/Zeus/Logan's relationship. I feel that the ending and the way they resolved the whole Keith Clayton thing was a bit of a cop-out but at the same time I wouldn't have it any other way as I can now believe that Beth/Logan get their Happy Ever After. ...more V\u0161echny knihy od pana Sparkse m\u00e1m prost\u011b stra\u0161n\u011b r\u00e1da :-) A u Talismanu to bylo tak\u00e9 tak.

To be honest I first thought that I would put it down after a few chapters; but then everything started to, you know, mix together so perfectly, that I couldn't help but loved it. The writing style was nice and simple, with no use of tricky words or hard-understanding stuff. Specially loved those little phrases Nana used with Elizabeth all the time. And such a curious fact that Nana named all the time Keith as the \"late husband\", like a premonition of what was about to happen later. The plot was nice developed and entretaining; all points of view highly interesting. Though I woud have loved one from Zeus point view :) The ending was shoking. Cause I totally did not expect that, but however, was good according to the story. And I have to admit that I had a little heart attack in the final scene (when Beth visits the cementery), cause for a moment, I thought that Logan had died and no. That could not happen. He is just so perfect and bae and gosh so hot. Also love the quoting and still have to see the movie (if someone has already seen it, can you tell me if it is a good one?). \u201cIn the blink of an eye, something happens by chance - when you least expect it - sets you on a course that you never planned, into a future you never imagined.\u201d ...more I will always compare every Nicholas Sparks book I read to my favorite, The Last Song.

Un tipo que no conoces de nada, que duerma con tu foto bajo la almohada, que decida buscarte caminando desde Colorado a Hampton sin ninguna raz\u00f3n aparente da que pensar sobre la clase de tipo que es. Y el gran conflicto es ese. Lo dice la sinopsis, pero es gracioso. Keith, el ex marido de Elizabeth, tambi\u00e9n sabe que eso es raro. Completamente extra\u00f1o y digno de alg\u00fan soci\u00f3pata. Es como si se hubiera burlado de la incoherencia de su propia trama. Que Sparks se hubiera dado cuenta de lo absurdo que suena que alguien en su juicio te busque con tanto ah\u00ednco. Sin conocerte. Solo por una foto que encontr\u00f3 en la arena. Tiene su gracia el asunto. A\u00fan as\u00ed, me gust\u00f3. Lo le\u00ed bien, me enganch\u00f3, no me dej\u00f3 tirada en un charco de babas por amor a estos dos, pero mantuvo mi atenci\u00f3n. Cosa que no cre\u00ed posible. La otra pega es lo perfectos que son . Super perfectos. Super bellos. Super habilidosos. Como si no concibiera en el mundo un personaje que no tuviera m\u00e1s virtudes que defectos. Como si Elizabeth no pudiera permitirse envejecer. Porque como dice, parece que con la edad estaba m\u00e1s bonita que las universitarias con las que Keith sal\u00eda. Pero ser\u00eda una est\u00fapida si pensara que es algo exclusivo de este autor, porque todo el mundo suele caer en los estereotipos. Pero qu\u00e9 se yo. Esperaba m\u00e1s. Lo que s\u00ed, sent\u00ed que Logan era de piedra. A\u00fan con sus pensamientos, recuerdos y lo que fuera, era bastante imperturbable . No se siente natural ni al hablar ni al moverse.

This is the story of how a photograph brings together two strangers. Logan, a soldier before the story opens, finds the photograph while serving in Iraq. After surviving a series of close calls Logan comes to believe that the photograph he's been carrying is lucky and is the reason he hasn't been killed. Under the suggestion of his best friend and fellow soldier Logan sets out on foot with his German Shepard Zeus to find the woman in the photograph. Using only the clues from the image and the short message written on the back Logan finds Beth, Elizabeth from the photograph, living in a small North Carolina town. He takes a job working for her grandmother caring for and training dogs at the kennel she owns. There are problems from the beginning, however, with Beth's ex-husband, a local deputy. His jealousy over the couple's budding romance brings this book to its climax in which death is a very real possibility for all three characters. Readers may find this book a bit predictable, but its still sure to please! ...more The Lucky One was a light, easy and absorbing romantic read. It wasn't one of Nicholas Spark's better novels but the story flowed well and the characters were interesting but the book did tend to get very predictable and clich\u00e9d towards the end. I didn't like the ending at all! It was poorly developed and felt very forced and rushed. It's a good book to read on the beach during a hot sunny day. Three stars! \u201cYou should be kissed everyday, every hour, every minute.\u201d 3.5 Stars and only because this was a buddy read with Holly. Else, it would have one or more \u2013 fewer stars. This is my first Nicholas Sparks book and frankly don\u2019t understand the hype. There were a few things I liked, but nothing I absolutely loved. I\u2019m pretty sure this was the normal style and depth of this author, so saying, I won\u2019t go out of my way to read another. It would have to be highly recommended. Things liked about his story: 1 \u2013 I liked the premise of the story as outlined in the book b 3.5 Stars and only because this was a buddy read with Holly. Else, it would have one or more \u2013 fewer stars. This is my first Nicholas Sparks book and frankly don\u2019t understand the hype. There were a few things I liked, but nothing I absolutely loved. I\u2019m pretty sure this was the normal style and depth of this author, so saying, I won\u2019t go out of my way to read another. It would have to be highly recommended. Things liked about his story: 1 \u2013 I liked the premise of the story as outlined in the book blurb. This is what attracted me in the first place. I was looking for something Holly and I could read, could potentially be a bit uplifting [right Hol?] and provide the pace needed for \u201cbuddy read\u201d success. An Iraq war veteran trying to get on with life \u201cafter\u201d. I\u2019ve found with a veteran who has served in war, there is a \u201cbefore\u201d and an \u201cafter\u201d. It defines phases in their life \u2013 the rest of us have real difficulty understanding. This was a story about an \u201cafter\u201d and this intrigued me. Plus, with the romance genre there is a covenant of a HEA, and we [Holly and I] needed this. 2 \u2013 Zeus. This German Shepard rocked! He was well trained, had heart, and so much personality. He was a true character in the book and he was just wonderful. He is the hero of this book. He is Logan\u2019s creation and therefore, you have a higher appreciation for Logan \u2026 hmm\u2026 Maybe I do have something I find extraordinary in this book; a dog! 3 -- The structure of this story. The author titled each of his chapters by the character who would tell the chapter story \u2013 their POV. The chapters were short and I thought this moved the story along a bit faster for me. We can all do most anything, if we think it may be short and over soon \u2013 right? A few things I didn\u2019t like so much: 1 \u2013 For me, it is all about \u201cfeeling\u201d the characters in a story. The pull. I call this rich characterization. Even if you don\u2019t have a deep secondary [love my sports analogy?], or a depth in your secondary character, you should, to enjoy, have depth in your primary characters. This book did not have this \u2013 at all. I found a depth to Logan, and think this is due to the \u201cflash backs\u201d to Logan\u2019s war experiences and his \u201cjust after\u201d struggle to cope, plus Zeus. So he, I like quite a bit. Beth, not at all. 2 \u2013 Beth. She was a primary character in the story and I didn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d it. I thought she was rather like an automaton. The author kept telling me she was a good teacher, she was an attractive woman, she was smart, mature, intelligent, but I didn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d it. I felt rather the contrary and wondered what I was missing. Rather piss poor writing to so screw up a primary character. This is a male author who totally missed pulling the feminine out of this \u201cperson\u201d he created. The only few things I \u201cfelt\u201d about her, she is a good mother and had pretty awful taste in men. Her first husband was a real AssHat, and none of the others we hear about are much to write home about. Up until Logan enters her life and we know, she really had nothing to do with that choice. 3 \u2013 Intimacy portrayed in this book. What? Well, let me tell you\u2026 we\u2019ve all read those books where there is sex, sex and more sex and we wonder where they get the energy and it becomes almost monotony \u2013 \u201coh, not again\u2026\u201d. This was rather the opposite, but the same. There was no intimacy. They had sex \u2013 only a few times Thank God, but they did, but it wasn\u2019t intimate. No lead up. They were attracted to each other, but the flirting for these 30somethings was non-existent or mimic\u2019d what you\u2019d see in Junior High, then, \u2026 ta da \u2026 it\u2019s over? What? Did I miss something? Oh, intimacy \u2026 Logan carried her to bed. Yep, that\u2019s it! Well, it did nothing for this reader and frankly, could have gone the whole book without it just fine it was that meaningful. Rather like a bad date and you say to yourself, hmm.. well, been there, done that, and not going back\u2026 but they did! Just didn\u2019t feel it and don\u2019t think they did either. So sad this was as good as it was going to get for these two. So, not sure what the hype is all about. I\u2019m sure this book is representative of his other works \u2013 not his first rodeo and all that. So, he either has friends in high places, or something, but I\u2019ve read better Indie books frankly. More pizzazz than this one! And, you always, always say, the book was better than the movie \u2013 right? Just sayin\u2019 \u2026 look what you have to look forward to. I\u2019ll wait for the DVD and then rent from RedBox; $2 and return next day! You may not mind \u201cblah\u201d in your stories. Maybe this could be a good fit for you \u2026? I frankly don\u2019t like blah and have little time for the things I enjoy - and - if it hadn\u2019t been for the dialogue I had with Holly_Loves_To_Read along the way, I know I wouldn\u2019t have finished \u2013 would have been bored long ago. If you think it may be something you\u2019d enjoy, give it a go. But don\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t have much fun. I really have a better idea \u2026 If you really want a nicely written book about the \u201cafter\u201d for an Iraq war veteran, try \u201cBecause of You\u201d by Jessica Scott. One more thing \u2013 we\u2019re all friends here \u2013 right? If you read this review and believe in the power of prayer, could you please say a little prayer for Holly. She is one of our GR friends and is going through a few very tough RL \u201cthings\u201d. A prayer would be a very nice thing to do for a friend. Thank you Good Reads friends! Happy Reading! ...more", "Title": "The Lucky One"},
