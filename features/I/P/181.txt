I don\u2019t normally drink martinis,<---M> but according to Augusten Burroughs</---M>, the famous Cedar Tavern on University Place in Manhattan serves huge ones (\u201cenormous; great bowls of vodka soup\u201d) - so you get the most of what you pay for. But as it turned out their martinis are actually rather small, the opposite of Burroughs\u2019 claim. And the bartender on the second floor told me that the martinis have been the same size for at least five years since he began working there. So what the fuck is Burroughs talking about? Not that I was surprised by this. While reading Dry \u2013 a \u201cmemoir\u201d about overcoming the \u201cdisease\u201d of alcoholism - I couldn\u2019t help but think Burroughs had, um, invented many of the book\u2019s anecdotes and conversations. The Cedar Tavern trip confirmed the suspicions. Do a little research and discover the writer Augusten Burroughs as a liar on many levels. First, his real name is Christopher Robison. I can\u2019t fully read his twisted mind, but it\u2019s pretty clear the name-change is supposed to lend his authorial presence more grandeur. Is he trying to sound aristocratic? Sophisticated? British? As if he were William S. Burroughs\u2019 son? Or what? You really should know you\u2019re on the wrong track when you do the opposite of Mark Twain, who changed his high-sounding given name of Samuel Clemens into something people like Augusten Burroughs would likely describe as common. About half of Dry is dialogue, and I wondered how Burroughs could recall all those intricate conversations, word for word, especially if he was drinking a liter of scotch every night, as he claims. We aren\u2019t even given any prefatory disclaimer, as memoirs often issue, about how the conversations are recalled to the best of the author\u2019s ability. Here\u2019s a typical exchange (note that \u201cHayden\u201d is a friend Burroughs met at their Minnesota-based rehab clinic): Hayden is aghast.<---F> \u201cThat seems hostile,\u201d he says</---F>. \u201cRick\u2019s a fuck. He\u2019s a homophobic closet case and he hasn\u2019t got an ounce of talent. He just hitched his wagon to Elenor years ago and she\u2019s too busy to notice he\u2019s as dumb as a box of hair.\u201d Hayden takes a long sip of water. \u201cYou have to keep an eye on this Rick person.\u201d For starters, even if you had remembered saying something as retarded as \u2018dumb as a box of hair\u2019 you wouldn\u2019t publish it for the world to see, would you? Anyway, that\u2019s simply not a line someone just improvises in the middle of a chat. That\u2019s a line a bad writer cooks up because he can\u2019t think of anything else to put down on the page. Hayden taking a \u2018long\u2019 sip of water (rather than, say, a short sip) is a nice touch, don\u2019t ya think? That\u2019s true literary talent right there for you. The only part of Dry I didn\u2019t hate is the very beginning when Burroughs is still routinely getting shit-faced. The buzz is officially killed on page 33 when he checks into rehab. It doesn\u2019t even get dimly interesting again until page 257 after Burroughs falls off the wagon. The 200 or so pages in between are of course replete with a lot of AA/rehab talk and sermonizing. But mostly for Burroughs, the sober pages are just an excuse for the author to tell us all about himself and his dull relationships with co-workers and boyfriends. Unlike some of his fellow AA friends, he says he has no trouble staying sober, and even quickly stops attending meetings, so that he can instead focus the narrative on the drama of his relationships, whether we like it or not. Alcohol is rarely mentioned during these pages except when Burroughs feels the need to remind the reader that this is still a story about alcoholism. For instance, somewhere in the middle of the book, he concocts a tale about how he once went to a bar by himself and almost ordered a beer but then pulled himself together at the last second, settling for a Diet Coke. We are supposed to care and empathize with what is obviously an imagined scene. And then he\u2019ll end certain sections by pretending to have a craved a drink at whatever point he\u2019s at in his fascinating relationship memoir: \u201cI have a sudden longing for a Cape Codder,\u201d he\u2019ll tell us, out of nowhere, leaving it at that. In hindsight, I realize these lines are intended to foreshadow his eventual return to drink. This is a story after all, so it really doesn\u2019t matter if any of those longings actually happened. In one scene after he quit drinking he describes emptying a bottle of scotch into the toilet: \u201cI flush twice. And then I think, why did I flush twice? The answer, [sic] is of course, because I truly do not know myself. I cannot be sure I won\u2019t attempt to drink from the toilet, like a dog.\u201d Sorry folks, but I\u2019m just not buying this schlock. And I\u2019m happy to say that I didn\u2019t buy this schlock \u2013 the book was given as a gift. One flush wouldn\u2019t get rid of the booze?? One flush wouldn\u2019t prevent Burroughs from sticking his face into the toilet bowl to drink the (now alcohol-free) water? I don\u2019t know how anyone could believe any of this. To begin with, Burroughs wasn\u2019t that bad an alcoholic. He wasn\u2019t knocking back cologne or anything. He\u2019s a rich-boy, then advertising copywriter whose worst offense was to overindulge on martinis and Dewar\u2019s, with perhaps a little blow on the side. If you quit that, you don\u2019t fall off the wagon by drinking toilet water. You simply go to the liquor store and buy another bottle. And I think this yarn is the winner: He tells us that his spacious Manhattan apartment is \u201cclean and modern in design\u201d except that it is ridden with empty liquor bottles. \u201cThree hundred one-liter bottles of scotch\u2026And when I used to drink beer instead of scotch, the beer bottles would collect. I counted the beer bottles once: one thousand, four hundred and fifty-two,\u201d he writes, expecting to horrify us. Now, I don\u2019t believe any of this for a second, but if it is actually true, then the trouble here is that Burroughs is just a fucking nutcase, and alcoholism is the least of his problems. Think about it: he spends his time inventing stories that he passes off as biography. That\u2019s pretty twisted if you ask me. Burroughs himself tells us that he didn\u2019t even realize leaving thousands of empty bottles on the floor was abnormal, until the subject was brought up in rehab. He also pretends to have not known that the very purpose of rehab is to make people dry. Without a trace of irony, Burroughs writes, \u201cSober. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to become.\u201d Yeah right, like he didn\u2019t know. For some reason, I can\u2019t help but think that this sort of contrived stupidity plays well with the American public. So here\u2019s my verdict on this book: Like other \u201cmemoir\u201d specialists Dave Eggers and more notoriously James Frey, Burroughs\u2019 only goal is self-promotion. The book is a con job written for the sort of people who consider themselves hip and liberal but secretly watch America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos. Ostensibly the memoir is about alcoholism but like I said that\u2019s not what it\u2019s really about. The only subject discussed at length is Augusten Burroughs and all of his tedious relationships. \u201cDry\u201d is definitely the operative word here, but not for the stated reason. Alcohol is just the decoy plot, so that the author and publisher can rationalize the appearance of yet another Burroughs reflection on his ordinary or otherwise tiresome life. There are no ideas in this book. No insights. No worthy discussion of booze and drugs. It is shallow, written, apparently, for fans of Elle, People and Time magazines and for Oprah Winfrey, as the laudatory quotes on the back of the book indicate. And this is what pathetically passes for good, edgy, humorous writing in America these days. And I suppose the question of whether it\u2019s memoir or as I argue fiction is ultimately trumped by the unavoidable conclusion that this book is quite simply the literary equivalent of dog shit, not fit for consumption by anyone who has taste, never mind an ability to detect fraudulence. ...more What do Haruki Murakami (born 1949) and Augusten Burroughs (born 1965) have in common?

Murakami interweaves non-human fantasy in his human characters. Burroughs characters are human but they seem to be fantasy. Murakami is straight and very conservative while Burroughs is a flamboyant gay. You know that what you are reading is not true when you read Murakami while when you read the memoirs of Burroughs, you know that they can be true but deceptively true. But the biggest difference for me is that as you read more and more Murakami books, as you get the same ingredient each time, you\u2019ll get tired of him. Believe me, I\u2019ve read 8 of his works (and have plan of reading the rest but I am taking a rest). My first book of him was Kafka and the Shore and I liked it so much that I read the two other books right away. He started with 4 stars and this last book, a memoir, What We Talk About When We Talk About Running only got 2 stars from me. On the other hand, it is exactly the opposite with my Burroughs experience. I first read his boyhood memoir Running With Scissors and I gave it a 2-star. This was followed by The Wolf At My Table , about his relationship with his father and You Better Not Cry (2 stars each). But this one, Dry is not hysterical and very subdued. He is still gay and he goes out and makes out with different men, some of them casually, but it talks about more serious and believable matters like serious alcoholism, AIDS and seemingly faithful (translation: more than sex escapades) gay love affairs. My favorite part is when Burroughs was out in a gay bar and he said to himself: this place is full of naked sad lives. This struck me as poetic and honest. Those gay men in a bar seeking for sex (that hopefully turn into love) are sad people. The music could be bouncy. The men could be good-looking with gorgeous body. They could be rowdy. But in the end, when they go home to their apartments, they can be alone and sad. Gay lives, excuse me if this is demeaning, can be lonelier than straight heterosexual lives. Burroughs has two affairs here. One of them is Pighead who died of AIDS and the character that made me think that the shrieking gay boy in Running with Scissors is actually a sensitive man who could be lovable and respectable. The other lover is the other alcoholic Forster who is so handsome any gay can go crazy about him. This character brought the human aspect of the gayness of Burroughs. While reading, I told myself that the only difference of him being gay to a straight man is that his lover is another man. All the rest are the same. Memorable characters that brought out the sensitive logical and probably lovable side of Burroughs. The more you read his works, the more you understand who he is. He could be exaggerating at times but that\u2019s what they call as poetic license. But still, I liked this book. First time that I actually liked Burroughs. So, I expect more from his next book in my tbr pile: Magical Thinking. Unlike Murakami\u2019s books that you get tired of his style as you read his works one after the other. ...more Sharp, candid, and surprisingly poignant...

But, really, Burroughs has managed to be disarmingly droll while being frightfully honest and self-deprecating. I can't attest if that's from being gay, the result of coming from a dysfunctional family, or perhaps from working in advertising (in New York, no less). What made this story interesting for me was the way he narrated his excruciating battle with alcoholism, that even someone who doesn't suffer from that ailment can actually empathize with him. Definitely he refrained from being too long-winded about it, avoiding the pitfall of letting his story become boring or monotonous--his cracks about himself, his fellow addicts, down to the closet case that is his boss, openly drew chuckles from me. There was enough balance of falling into bouts of introspection as well as allowing the story to progress via the lively dialogues with the equally captivating secondary characters--the tragedy that is Pighead, the complexity and apparent exceptionality that is Foster, and the oddity namely Greer, among others. A guilty enjoyment for me as well was the encounter with the German advertising client who unwittingly provokes the imagination of Augusten to spout Nazi stereotypes. Unexpected, though, was the striking insight into repressed emotions and the ability of a person to love another despite seemingly insurmountable flaws. Augusten's relationships perfectly capture what I think is a quintessentially urban tendency of people nowadays to tirelessly compensate for what they think they are missing in life. In a way, this novel shows how cheerless that condition is, and, at the same time, be unafraid of what is, after all, a price for being human. Augusten's narration of what his childhood was, the blatant abandonment he experienced from his parents, the perversion done to him as a teenager, makes the reader in turns awed and morbidly fascinated with the man that he has become. There were times our protagonist was readily aware of his shortcomings--from keeping up with the AA meetings to juggling his relationships with Pighead and Foster--and if those weren't uncomfortable enough, the reader is also made cognizant of his glaring denials about how he was living his life, pre- and post-rehab. I highly recommend this novel. Whether one is seeking an understanding of alcoholism, or simply in want of a refreshing, entertaining read--granted it's peeking into the \"memoirs\" of a self-confessed mess--this story will take you from laughs to sadness, hope to sorrow. (and back again). Without a doubt, this work proves that Burroughs is an Original. ...more LOVED IT! \"Dry.\" This book I read the next day... couldn't put it down. The memoir follows Augusten in his success as a mid-20s creative advertiser, which seems like the most appropriate job between Burrough's self-confessed childhood ideal jobs of hairdresser and writer (in \"Running w/ Scissors\"). This one has a different flavor altogether, kind of like the Truffaut series of Antoine Doinel films.

Here, the psychology of Burroughs, his emotions raw and visceral, are on brilliant display. With age, it seems, comes a different mentality altogether... here is testament. This one has a great, bulky climax: after Burroughs undergoes now-famous rehab... will he relapse? The reader cannot stop reading to find out exactly this. The central question, and all the near mistakes Augusten makes keeps the suspense going. It is trainwreck drama/memoir! Burroughs is a great writer, my second favorite Burroughs as a matter of fact. He can give relevance to any bizarre or tragic event unlike mere observers, like ourselves. He is not, it seems, just a spectator, nor is he, despite the fact that he is a rich Manhattanite, mega pretentious. Egads! Both books are so different that you cannot believe that they occurred to the same individual. Because they did & because this fact means that our OWN lives are unexpectedly complex, sometimes truly symbolic and difficult to get through, it is a book to read. Clearly, it gives some bizarre sense of hope while remaining uber-entertaining. ...more I got to be Augusten Burrough's escort when he spoke at the Texas Book Festival a few years ago, and he was very soft spoken, low key and ordinary looking. He spoke to a very large, adoring crowd in the senate chambers, and then signed books for quite a long time to an equally adoring snaking line of fans. He was very sweet and humble.

He also bolted out of there as quickly as he could, and asked to be taken directly to his hotel, although my friend Kelly and I managed to drive him around Austin a little showing him things. He's sober now, bummer, so we couldn't take him out and get him drunk. He game me his badge to sell on ebay but I think I stuck it in a box somewhere. Anyway, this book is amazing, it's almost too confessional; you feel like you can practically feel his pain as he hits rock bottom and tries to claw his way out of addiction. Not nearly as funny as Running with Scissors, but it shouldn't because it's him as an adult, realizing the pain and abuse of his childhood, and the excruciating results of his bad choices and bad behavior. It's an extraordinarily compelling book. I gave it too a young, gay friend of mine who had never heard of him, amazingly enough, and he walked into work after finishing it, just speechless with emotion. It's almost too much, and you can understand why his fans feel like they really know him after reading it. Intense is all I can say. ...more This book is funny. It's funny and it's true and it's real. I laugh and crack up about what Burroughs is saying, even though he is a mean funny. I say \"a mean funny\" because he really rips into other people and judges them. Of course, he does the same thing to himself, but I can't help feeling a little guilty about enjoying this book so much.

Sometimes he'll be saying something and I'll be laughing and then I'll think, \"Should I really be laughing at this?\" Believe me, it's nothing too offensive or disgusting, or I would put the book down. But it is something I notice. Burroughs will always be, for me, the man who I love reading his funny observations but who I'd never want to be friends with in real life. Burroughs is shallow and vain and foul-mouthed. But he knows that about himself. And because he knows that about himself, he can write very funny books about it. This book is about Burroughs being a drunk, and his long path to sobriety. It was touching, hilarious, painful and real. I enjoyed following Burroughs on his journey from being forced into rehab, to AA, to flirting with other addicts. Will he get sober? Will he relapse? I was genuinely worried about him at some points, yelling at my book \"Don't do it, Augusten!\" But of course he can't hear me and he's already made the decision, anyway. And written about it for my amusement and reading pleasure. I like how at first, Burroughs thinks he's too cool for school. This rehab is lame! I won't go to AA because it is so dweeby! But slowly he starts to realize how much he needs help (a new, hot guy at AA doesn't hurt, either). The subplot is him watching his good friend and ex-lover die of AIDS. This is very sad and poignant, even with Burroughs's joking and quips. Burroughs really lets you get into his head - his mixed feelings about the men in his life, his horrific memories of his abusive past, and his need - his love - for alcohol. This book, while humorous, also takes the reader to the very pits of addiction, and brings the filth of having an addiction squatting in your brain into the light. It's not pretty, but it's necessary and eye-opening. A very deep and funny portrait of a recovering addict. P.S. He does reference the pedophilia he experienced as a kid growing up. If this bothers you, either don't read the book or skip every section that's in italics. P.P.S. If you are an addict of any kind and you do not feel like you have a good grip on your sobriety yet, I am warning you that this book can be triggering. Very triggering. So best save it for your one-year-sober anniversary and not the white-knuckling part. ...more \"You were spectacular,\" Hayden tells me afterwards. \"How so?\" \"You were so honest and substantive.

Or maybe it's real horror. \"You absolutely terrify me. The depth of your shallowness is staggering.\" Really, it [the shallowness] was staggering at times. But at least Burroughs wrote about it in an honest, hilarious way. A very fun, open, quick read. Sad too. I liked this more than Running with Scissors. ...more What more can be said about Augusten Burroughs? He is an amusing mess! If half of the information in his memoirs is true, I will give him five stars for his survival skills. If his memoirs are later discovered to be false,I will give him five stars for creativity and fantastic story telling.I can't put this book down. I haven't read their books, but it seems that his mother and brother are capitalizing on family dysfunction as well. They all make me feel extremely boring and sane. This is the second memoir by Augusten Burroughs, which details his life in his 20s, living in New York City, working as an advertising executive, making tons of money, and slowly killing himself each day by drinking more than seems humanly possible.

His detailed descriptions of people, places and feelings are so well-written. I was entranced by his story immediately. This was a much easier read for me compared to \"Running with Scissors.\" They were both well-written but this one, at least, was about him as an adult making his own decisions. The most profound part of the book, for me, was the description of Pighead on his deathbed, as it was so painfully similar to my brother's death. The description of his illness was as if I was reading my own journal during the time of Jim's illness. I feel as if I know Auguesten and I truly wish him a wonderful life. Grade: A ...more THE break-up book.

(those first 90 are the hardest.) Not to mention, it makes you feel better to know that his life during this period is way worse than anything that you're going through.

Or, if we take into account that he kept a journal, why would he write this observation down? This completely unnecessary made-up detail is unoriginal at best and cloying sentimentality at worst. Second of all, and the cause of most of my frustrated sighs, is Burroughs' excessive use of over-the-top metaphors, similes in particular. It was getting to the point where there would be at least one bad metaphor per page. And believe me, I love a good, well-thought out metaphor, as it can add insight and universality to writing. These metaphors, though, seem to serve no purpose than either to shock the reader or to prove how hilarious and cool Burroughs is. Here are some god-awful similes: - \"When I say 'rehab' I raise my chin, as though talking about the Oscars.\" [Maybe I have to be a gay man to get what this is supposed to look like?] - \"Like stopping into Baby Gap before having an abortion.\" [Ooo how scandalous!] - \"Paul concentrates, hard. He looks as if he can't decide between a vodka tonic or a screwdriver.\" [That kind of decision does take quite a bit of hard concentration...] - (he is imagining what AA meetings are like) \"Maybe there's even a secret handshake, like the Mormons who also don't drink.\" [What the hell is he talking about?] - \"So when you combine alcohol with a slob, you just end up with something that would appall an self-respecting heroin-addicted vagrant.\" [Wow, with one sloppy metaphor, Burroughs managed to elevate himself to be much superior to heroin-addicted vagrants and equate himself to the poor guys.] - \"In the shower I think about how I'm a drunk that doesn't get to drink. It seems unfair. Like keeping a Chihuahua in a hamster cage.\" [That makes NO sense at all.] The third major flaw with this book is found on page 104: Burroughs has just arrived at his very first AA meeting, and the first thing the chairman of the meeting says is, \"What you see here, what you hear here, stays here.\" Burroughs then spends the next four pages relating one woman's personal account of her struggle with alcoholism and her recovery. So here is the dilemma: either Burroughs is breaking that sacred rule or he is making up everything that happens in rehab and AA meetings. Undoubtedly he changes names, but I still think that is unfair to the other people in rehab and AA members who are only sharing their very personal stories because they know it is verboten to, say, publish these stories in a book. If he is making up these people and their stories, then perhaps he should call this book a fictionalized memoir. A minor detail: when Burroughs checks into rehab, he is placed in the detox room. And yet we have absolutely zip description of what it felt like to go through withdrawal. In fact, the lack of physical description (as in, what Burroughs feels physiologically) makes me question the truth of Burroughs' account. Why doesn't he even mention what it felt like when he initially stopped drinking in rehab? If he didn't feel anything, which I would find difficult to believe as he claimed to drink a liter of Dewars nightly AND was allergic to alcohol, then wouldn't it be worth mentioning that he miraculously had no physical withdrawal symptoms? I gave this book two stars instead of one for this reason: I think that Burroughs' goal in writing this memoir (and likely his other memoirs, though I have not read them nor do I have any intention of reading them now) is to yank an emotional reaction from his audience. If that is indeed his goal, then he has succeeded with me. I'm not sure Burroughs cares at all that my reaction is that I want nothing to do with him or his book(s). ...more Thank goodness the author acknowledged the criminal behavior of those who were supposed to be responsible adults, but who placed him in situations that no child or even young adult should have faced.

I read this quick read for book group in under three hours - which was about all the time it deserved. The literary tradition of great intoxicated writers may fascinate those who never studied Beatnik literature or Hemingway in school. But to satisfy the niche of urban hipster- intellectuals who are looking for a step above Lindsay Lohan's faux-glam adventures in US Weekly, this book was just an edited down version of James Frey's A Million Little Pieces, which I read on spring break at Canyon Ranch while detoxing from my own underage escapades. Although Frey was too audacious (and unethical, according to Oprah in 2006 and the recent issue of Vanity Fair...I cannot believe we're still talking about it) in his attempts to be a great memoirist through booz and bold moves, we all know that truth really can be stranger than fiction(whether 100% real or partially embellished); and those who live to tell about it in a well-crafted way deserve credit. The one rule of good writing I learned in school, however, is: keep talk about digestion, bodily fluids, or any other vulgarities people don't want to read about to a minimum. This is drugstore prose. If we reduce Burrough's memoir to the level of a \"quickie\" that's as cheaply satisfying as a Danielle Steel novel, then his account of addiction, if well-documented, should read with as much vim and vigor as if we were chain-smoking it. But it doesn't. Subtract all the bloated summary of ingesting, vomiting, or verbal headache, and all we get is flat character development, flat dialogue, and a brief account of rehab/institutionalization that does not even begin to compare with the world described to us in \"Girl, Interruped\" or \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\" This book's literary mediocrity is as cut and dry as a glass of Two Buck Chuck marked up to $14 - which is what I paid for this paperback. The only part of the memoir that was interesting was the advertising part. How on earth did he survive a meeting with clients at the Met while openly intoxicated? Overcome the real challenge of returning from rehab to a boss who sent him away and then expects him to gush full creative brilliance on a German beer account, when alcohol had seemingly been the tour-de-force behind his sarcastic excess in the first place? Perhaps he blames corporate BS as the cause of his deterioration...but it's probably his messed up parenting - which is clearly the more interesting part of his troubled life, as documented in Running With Scissors. (\"Interesting\" because it was made into a movie - if we're talking commercial success.) In the conclusion of Dry, his relationships fizzle, his significant other dies, and we are left with grotesque images of crack-cocaine and death that made me question why I was even bothering to finish this sophomoric and soporific \"been there\" \"done that\" Truth or Dare sharing. I felt like I'd forced myself to finish something that was all suds with little sustenance. Or stayed up for a party that was totally not worth it. ...more Apparently, I am drawn to books written by gay men.

But if my boss sent me to rehab for 30 days I would be like, \"Cool, 30 days paid vacation? Thanks!\" P.S. Now that I've finished I can comment more about the whole book. First off, 30 days of rehab no longer sounds like fun. It sounds like an extended version of a church lock-in I attended in high school that was full of awful self-esteem boosting exercises. Everyone talks about their feelings all day. No wonder they all wanted to drink more than anything in the world. It was heartbreaking and funny, although I suppose the progression of the author's alcoholism from denial to acceptance to sobriety to relapse and back again was exactly the formula I expected. Imagine how bad the reviews would have been if he went to rehab and came out still thinking it was a load of garbage that did not teach him anything? I suppose it was inspiring if you need help warding off the drink, but I'm not going there. I love the drink. I will say I could relate to the author's addiction to Foster, the hot crack addict. And I cried twice while listening to passages about Pighead, the author's best friend with HIV. ...more Brilliant, esp. if you have a dark, inappropriate sense of humor.

Struggling to c Continuing the memoir trilogy, Augusten Burroughs takes the reader through his struggles with addiction as a young man. Living in New York City, Burroughs is busy with an advertising firm, making six-figures, and having little to rein him in. He recounts how his drinking got in the way of his job, where he would turn up randomly reeking of alcohol. After embarrassing himself and the firm on numerous occasions, Burroughs is offered a choice; go into rehabilitation or lose the job. Struggling to come to terms with his drinking, Burroughs choose rehab, though stands firm that he does not need it. He departs for a facility in Minnesota, where he encounters a number of other addicts as various points in their sobriety journey. In the early stages, Burroughs feels that he can overcome his drinking by choice, the \"if I want it, I will do it\" attitude. He pushes back against the services offered and program presented, finding them silly and somewhat overbearing. However, he has an epiphany while in treatment and as his thirty days come to an end, he develops a new-found respect for sobriety and its fragility. The true test transpires when he's released, sent back to New York City armed with a small dose of program and the requirement to attend an outpatient facility for six months. Though not mandatory, Alcoholics Anonymous is also recommended, a lifelong support that could only help him stabilise in the outside world. As the memoir continues, Burroughs explores life back in New York, a special someone he meets in his outpatient group, and a lingering connection from his rehab days that tries not only to vie for his attention, but to keep him from falling off the deep end. Highly humerous throughout with strong passages of heartfelt angst, Burroughs serves up a stellar second volume to his memoirs as he forces the reader to think and feel in ways they may not have thought possible. With a better understanding of both his writing style and approach to the memoir mechanism, Burroughs' second instalment had me captivated from the outset. His use of concrete examples in the narrative combined with flashbacks offers the reader a wonderful combination of fresh material and poignant events that shape the man he became. Burroughs presents a close to seamless story of his struggles and the depths to which he sunk before pulling himself out, only to come crashing back to earth in a moment of weakness. He does offer extensive thanks to those who played a role in his recovery, but does not let the battle facing him go without crediting his own willpower. That he slipped up in numerous ways is not lost on the attentive reader, but this goes more to present Burroughs as a fallible man, rather than portraying an individual who can rise above the fray. Shocking in its honesty and clear in the pathway on which this journey developed, Burroughs provides the reader with insight and hope for a man who came close to losing it all. Again, a special thank you to Rae Eddy, who recommended the Augusten Burroughs memoirs. She has been a great help as I realise my need to deal with some of the blurry portions of my past to develop stronger and more solid bonds to the present, as I peer into what the future has in store.

This is the story of Augusten Borroughs's journey to overcome his addiction to alcohol. He is an advertising copywriter and it's clear he knows how to tell a compelling story. I loved the nuances and descriptors in his stories. I'd recommend it even if one is not going through recovery. This is a difficult, but worthwhile read. I admired the author's ability to share so openly about his addiction. Most of the time I didn't like him, yet I couldn't put the book down. Brutally honest. Makes you want to close your eyes and run from the room - but you keep reading. \"Dry\" is Augusten Burroughs' autobiographical account about his life as a drunk while working in advertising in New York City.

For the most part, it's a compelling, madcap read, but by the last few chapters, I was starting to tire of his ups and downs. He does have many humorous passages about his time in rehab, probably the most interesting part of the book. But he tends to be murky and vague when writing about his gay love life. The image that comes through is a young guy seeking quick gratification and unwilling or unable to make commitments to either friends or lovers. So any empathy we might have for him in his struggle with alcoholism gets trumped by our distaste for his conceit. Those who have read his first autobiography, \"Running with Scissors,\" (which he references many times) may be inclined to cut him slack, since his childhood was so chaotic. Many alcoholics might question how typical Burroughs' journey was: even when he hit bottom, he never seemed to lack money or a few friends to rely on. For yuppies who manage to hold onto their jobs despite blackouts, the story may ring true. I much preferred his anthology of short stories, \"Magical Thinking.\" He works better in sketching out short episodes than in sustaining a lengthy narrative. ...more This is the second Burroughs book I've read, and again, I find his writing not necessarily beautiful and poetic, or quotable and elegant, but incredibly engaging and real, and he makes me smile at how honest he is -- when he tells us something awful and personal about himself, I'm taken aback and almost embarrassed at first, then a little more embarrassed because I realize I do it too or at least do something similar and equally kind of disgusting and embarrassing, and then smile at his ability This is the second Burroughs book I've read, and again, I find his writing not necessarily beautiful and poetic, or quotable and elegant, but incredibly engaging and real, and he makes me smile at how honest he is -- when he tells us something awful and personal about himself, I'm taken aback and almost embarrassed at first, then a little more embarrassed because I realize I do it too or at least do something similar and equally kind of disgusting and embarrassing, and then smile at his ability to tell us this when I'd barely be able to write it down on a piece of paper that only I'd be reading. It's endearing. I am also a big fan in particular of cheesy, lame-sounding, last-thing-in-the-world-you-want-to-do self-help type activities with groups of people (teambuilding and the like would fall into this too, icebreakers, etc) that end up, at the end of the day, having exactly the effect they're intended to, and win you over, however much you thought you weren't 'that type'. (Warning: only Georgetown applicable: ) What do you expect, I was an ESCAPE leader. Though I guess the point is that the beauty of this shit is when it appeals to people that wouldn't dream of going on escape, let alone apply to be marshmallow roasters. ...more You can always tell when a real alcoholic writes about alcoholism. A lot of writers that just drink a lot or have an alcoholic friend think they can write about it. They can't. They can fake it with people who drink a lot or with people that aren't alcoholics. Augusten Burroughs is a real alcoholic and he writes about it. He writes well about it, but he doesn't know what book he is writing. The first 100 pages are hilarious. Then the book turns dead serious for 200 pages, well not dead serious, You can always tell when a real alcoholic writes about alcoholism. A lot of writers that just drink a lot or have an alcoholic friend think they can write about it. They can't. They can fake it with people who drink a lot or with people that aren't alcoholics. Augusten Burroughs is a real alcoholic and he writes about it. He writes well about it, but he doesn't know what book he is writing. The first 100 pages are hilarious. Then the book turns dead serious for 200 pages, well not dead serious, but not funny. Part of the problem is Augusten goes through a series of romantic personal crises after rehab. None of these are very funny. What kind of a book is this? Plenty of potentially funny stuff is still going on after rehab but the author now approaches it with a grim humor that just doesn't work. So the real problem is does Augusten want to approach this like David Sedaris or does he want to write a serious autobiography about alcoholism, the rise and fall and rise? We get some of both but there isn't any unity here. The one thing that is refreshing about this is it is not a book about a homosexual that is alcoholic. It is an alcoholic who is gay. There is a difference. ...more The perfect choice to read while recovering from surgery, since I could not leave the bed, and it turned out to be one of those books you can't put down once you start! While I sometimes questioned Burroughs' recollections (especially since he was admittedly trashed during most of the period of which he writes), the style is so interesting and engaging that I could overlook it.

While I sometimes questioned Burroughs' recollections (especially since he was admittedly trashed during most of the period of which he writes), the style is so interesting and engaging that I could overlook it. Although not as depressing and pseudo-sad as his first book, \"Running With Scissors\", it was the natural outcome of that premiere penning, and thankfully he decided to expand on his experiences for those of us who wondered what happened next. This tome is full of anecdotes and occasional outright hilarity, even if the subject matter is far from light. He seems to have learned much from other authors about what works, and what doesn't, when trying to hold your audience. Burroughs is certainly lucky to have emerged from his life-experiences as seemingly intact and functional as he appears to be these days; what he's really like behind the scenes, we don't know, of course - but to be able to write about all one has been through, and gain some measure of notoriety for it, is something many of us aspire to!( ...more Dry is Augusten Burrough's follow-up to Running with Scissors. Thank God I read this one first, or I woukd have never purchased another. The book chronicles Burrough's journey from successful ad exec to alcoholic _ in often funny, yet also touching ways. He goes to rehab early in the book, where he actually believes the program will \"teach\" him \"how to drink responsibly.\" And that it has nothing to do with stopping drinking altogether. One thing that never occurred to me is covered in the book: Dry is Augusten Burrough's follow-up to Running with Scissors. Thank God I read this one first, or I woukd have never purchased another. The book chronicles Burrough's journey from successful ad exec to alcoholic _ in often funny, yet also touching ways. He goes to rehab early in the book, where he actually believes the program will \"teach\" him \"how to drink responsibly.\" And that it has nothing to do with stopping drinking altogether. One thing that never occurred to me is covered in the book: a reason I had never thought of concerning the relapses of many addicts. When you are addicted to something, you tend to hang out with people who also use that drug of choice (may e not as badly in shape as you are); you also tend to hang around places with easy access to the drug. THIS is your lifestyle, and along with the alcohol, you must give this up. Imagine that. By turns touching and hysterical, I would highly recommend this book. I am certain some parts are embellished for effect, but for me it mostly rings true and gave me a glimpse into the mind and life of an addict. ...more After Running With Scissors, his memoir of his childhood, I didn\u2019t think Augusten Burroughs could offer anything more enjoyable. As it turns out, though, Dry is even better. It documents his attempts to conquer his alcoholism whilst at the same time dealing with his advertising job and the illness of his friend, Pighead (who is HIV positive). The recounting of his adventures is very funny, but there is more emotional depth in Dry than in Scissors.

The recounting of his adventures is very funny, but there is more emotional depth in Dry than in Scissors. Burroughs\u2019 writing is much better in this book as well, with long stretches that are unbearably tragic or moving. An honest account of alcoholism, Dry taught me many things about the affliction that I didn\u2019t know in a way that makes me sympathise with alcoholics more than I did before. He talks about rehab and therapy and the dinginess of AA meetings, and informs the reader of how alcoholism is an open-ended thing, something that never stops until you die. Without being able to ever \u201ccomplete\u201d it, the difficulty of staying sober is articulately expressed. Funny, moving, heartfelt, Dry is an excellent memoir. ...more<---C>Augusten Burroughs</---C>", "Title": "Dry"},
