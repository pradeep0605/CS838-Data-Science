You've got a li'l bit of Tolkien and a splash of Shakespearean tragedy in a Jets vs. Sharks sorta way... It makes for a lively story. Here's my issue... So, you have the kittpet, Rusty , longing to pounce on mice and rabbits, tearing into their cold, fuzzy, flesh--he meets Graypaw and is introduced to Thunderclan and meets <---C>Lionheart</---C> and Tigerclaw and Dustpaw and Sandpaw and they take him in and he becomes Firepaw and apprentices with Bluestar but Tigerclaw has this chip on his shoulder and doesn't like him and he runs into Yellowfang and falls for Spottedleaf , then has to save the honor or Ravenpaw who watched Redtail be killed by Oakheart , but it wasn't Oakheart it was Tigerclaw and meanwhile you have Shadowclan , which is Yellowfang's old gang and they're led by Brokenspear who has daddy issues and offs Raggedstar and sends Clawface to capture Frostfur's kits so there's this A-Team like maneuver to invade Shadowclan that Whitestorm leads and then Graypaw becomes Graystripe and Firepaw who was Rusty now becomes Fireheart ...

Don't you understand it's pointless? I'm not going to stop hating this book if you tell me \"I'm wrong.\" In fact, if anything, your words only make me feel nauseas when I think of this piece of garbage. And that's my final word. I won't be replying to any comment in here, I don't care why you love this (write your own review for that) and I won't read the rest of this series. ______________________ Original review: The first thing you need to know about me is that I hate cats. HATE THEM. They're are the living creatures I dread the most after roaches. I'm serious. I can't think about cats without flinching. I hear one, and I shudder. I see one, and I want to vomit. One gets near me and the good girl inside me is in risk of going far far away. I just can't stand them. The second thing you need to know is that I hate stories about talking animals. I literally cannot watch a TV show or a movie where there are talking animals without going insane. Really, I get so exasperated and furious I fear my heart will stop working. Those previous points led me to think I was not going to like this book, but I decided to try anyway because I've had pleasant surprises, for example, The Monstrumologist . That book had monsters and my eyes just roll until almost popping out of my head whenever I hear that word mentioned, BUT I LOVED that book/series, so with the hope of that thing also happening with this book, I finally gave it a try. I regret my decision. Why? Perhaps this is the most ridiculous book I've read after Twilight (and we're talking about one year). I just couldn't buy the concept. Clans of cats fighting? The hell? Yep. That's all this book is about. Some might say it's an original concept, but for me? It's just laughable. Also, the amount of absurd names was overwhelming to the point where I wanted to kill myself. Look at some examples: \u2192 Tiger paw , Gray paw , Fire paw , Lion heart , Dust paw , Sand paw , Blue star , Raven paw , Yellow fang , Long tail , Smudge, Crooked star , Tall star , Blackfoot, Dapple tail , Red tail , Oak heart , Darkstripe, Spottedleaf, Frostfur, Ragged star , Nightpelt, etc. You may have noticed that I highlighted some of the names... Well, it's because READING ALL THOSE FREAKING -PAW, -STAR, -HEART, -TAIL TERMINATIONS MADE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF!!! Some awkward sentences contributed to my almost madness too. Like this: \u201cWe got back in time,\u201d she meowed with a gasp. \u201cThe kits are safe!\u201d Meowed... with a gasp? That's like trying to talk while swallowing... or like gasping and talking at the same time. I tried doing it and I failed. My brother tried and he failed too. My mother is part of this group too and my sister as well. This felt just as wtf as the previous one: Yellowfang looked up at Bluestar and narrowed her eyes respectfully. Narrow eyes respectfully? How do you do that? Like this? Or maybe like this? [Damn. Aren't you a creepy one, Cinderella's stepmother?] This one might be an option too: For me, they all look the same (except some are more hate-filled), don't ya think? The unnecessary deaths were also another bug for me. Like, I didn't even get to know the character yet he died and I'm supposed to feel bad? For example, there was a Redtail (yeah, ludicrous name - don't even mention it) at the beginning. I didn't know who that was, and there comes some cat telling everyone Redtail's dead. I mean, wtf, who the hell is Redtail? And I'm not only talking about his death. There were many pointless ones. Why did they die? Just to... give more emotion to the story, I suppose? Well, Hunter, BIG FAIL HERE BECAUSE I COULDN'T CARE ANY LESS. Anyway, I'm sure I bashing a book most people love, but maybe this didn't work for me because it simply was ridiculous not a book targetted to my age. If you're a fan of talking animals and you love stupid stories about pointless \"warriors\" cats, then this might be just for you. ...more BEST BOOK EVER!!

After all, I like middle grade and YA fiction, and cats are cool, and Watership Down was one of my favorite novels of all time. So how could a book about warrior housecats go wrong? If you're one of those people that hate cilantro, than any salsa with cilantro in it is going to hit your \"ick, soapy\" button and displease you. This novel hit a lot of my ick buttons. For one, it has a lot of exclamation points in it, which I generally interpret as a crutch for weak writing. Also, Hunter rarely uses \"he said\" or \"she said\" preferring instead \"meowed, responded, purred, snapped, suggested, answered, called, growled\" etc. Also, the names drove me batty. Young cats have -paw as a suffix, leaders have -star as a suffix, and the others have a different suffix. so you have nothing but compound names. Firepaw, Ravenpaw, Brokenstar, Bluestar, Tigerclaw, Lionheart. Once I'd already had my pet peeves hit,I started looking for reasons to explain why I didn't want to finish it. I think part of it is that the cats don't act like cats. That's probably not fair, because I read Tad Williams' Tailchaser's Song and liked it, but for some reason I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief here. Housecats are not social in the way that dogs, rabbits, deer, wolves, sea lions, and other animals are. To have them forming clans, and caring about such things as group cohesion and honor (honor? Cats?) made them feel more like dogs, or like aliens that I didn't understand. I also don't think that cats cache kills for later. I know for certain that cats have no herblore whatsoever, but I'm a big reader of fantasy, so I'm not sure why I wasn't able to swallow it here. That's not to say that I don't recommend this book. Both my daughters (ages 8 and 10) adore these books, though the younger one is not a strong reader and prefers the graphic novel version. My niece (9) also adores these novels, as do her friends. So clearly, there's something here they're taking out if it (a story about kitties). They probably also are responding to the tried-and-true plot of \"boy from humble origins learns from his elders, grows, and eventually surpasses those who taught him to become the greatest of all.\" The plotting isn't terrible, and I did care about what happened, I just wasn't willing to wade through the irritating prose to get there. So I cheated. A hundred pages from the end, I gave up and asked my kid what happened. Spoiler alert: nothing you haven't predicted by chapter four. ...more This review is by Pippi, guest reviewer, age 1 and a half; tabby cat.

I live with nice humans so I don't know what this is like.

This review won the Ultimate Book Reviewer Award given by her school's Language Arts teacher. Do you ever wonder what your pet cat thinks about? Fantasy author Erin Hunter brings you this spine-tingling, action-packed, fantasy adventure novel about wild cats. Explore and experience the land from the eyes of Rusty, a common house cat that dreams about the forest and all its wonders. One fateful day, Rusty finds himself walking towards Thunderclan camp, a whole new world where wild cats fight as warriors under the warrior code. Medicine cats used their knowledge of herbs and cures to heal the wounded, and apprentices trained with their mentors to become full-fledged warriors. All this happens beneath the leader's rule, and that leader just happens to be Bluestar, the cat that Rusty met outside his house gates. Training to become a warrior of Thunderclan, Rusty now named Firepaw, must faced the dangers that lurk in his path to becoming a warrior. Once such danger is Tigerclaw, the fierce and ambitious mentor of Ravenpaw, his timid friend. With Redtail, the deputy dead, Tigerclaw claims that he saw Oakheart, the Riverclan deputy, kill him. Firepaw then proceeds to ask Ravenpaw, as he was the only cat that was there to witness the murder. Firepaw wants answers, but he know he cannot get them in Thunderclan camp, knowing that Tigerclaw will attempt to kill Ravenpaw to keep him silent. Graypaw, Firepaw's new best friend, accompanies him while escorting Ravenpaw to an abandoned barn on the moors. The characters are the reason I loved this novel. They were all described wonderfully, and each cat has different traits and personalities. They all look different too!! Fur colors range from an ordinary brown to a spectacular golden tabby fur. There are so many creative ideas put into this book, and one of them is the idea that wild cats live in big groups and depend on each other for survival. It's really, really hard to choose a favorite character out of this book, because there are so many cats to choose from. But if I really had to pick up one, I'd choose Graypaw. Who wouldn't love a stubborn, friendly gray kitty who likes to crack jokes? I also like that supportive, helpful attitude of his. He's not afraid to stand up for his friends, and he's always going to be right there next to you if you need help, though he can get a little carried away sometimes, I think he's generally a great friend to have. If fantasy and adventure novels catch your attention, then this is the book for you! It has very descriptive writing that puts images in your head, and the tension and emotions that the characters display might just give you goosebumps! To find out what happens next, you'll have to read the book! ...more This review is for the all of the Warriors books (not New Prophecy or Power of Three or Omen of the Stars- just the first and original subseries) These books were amazing.

There are loads of books in this series, and there are just a couple of newly-released ones I haven't got. For my birthday, I got some more and I decided to start the series agin, just to catch up. This book seemed even better than I read it for the first time in June 2009. The first series is set in a forest, divided in to four territories, each belonging to one clan - ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan and ShadowClan. The main focus of the story is on ThunderClan, where there are not many warriors (cats that are tranied to defend the clan). The leader, Bluestar, accepts a 'kittypet' (house cat) into the clan named Rusty. Many of the clan cats protest against this, but Rusty still becomes an apprentice (a young cat training to be a warrior). Rusty's name therefore becomes Firepaw. He makes a best friend called Graypaw, who is also an apprentice. Before Firepaw joins ThunderClan, a ThunderClan cat called Tigerclaw murders his clans' deputy Redtail, in secret, to try and become deputy himself. But his hopes were shattered as Bluestar annouced that Lionheart would became deptuty instead. When Lionheart dies Tigerclaw gets his own way and becomes deputy. Firepaw finds out that Ravenpaw, Tigerclaw's spprentice, knew about the secret behind Redtail's death and also discovers that Tigerclaw is out to get Ravenpaw. Firepaw and Grawpaw help Ravenpaw escape to a farm beyond clan territory, where a kind cat called Barley lives. At the end of the book, Firepaw gets his warrior name: Fireheart.

Conclusion Continuing the Series: Yes Recommending: Yes Short Review: This book is more geared towards younger kids, since i know for a fact it's in the kids section at my library, which is where i kept seeing it. So i jumped into this not really knowing what it was about, besides cats. I really didn't think it would interest me thou since it's about cats, and for kids, but i was so wrong, i really liked this. There was too many names for me, thou some where fun, Yellowfang (my favorite), Ravenpaw, Oakheart. There was enough action to keep me awake, and no romance at all. I really liked it and look forward to reading more of this series :D Misc. Book Boyfriend: n/a Best Friend Material: n/a ...more Wow, this is a dumb book. My main gripe here is that these characters are not cats. Despite the grumblings about twolegs etc, they really don't think like small, semi-social predators. These are humans in cat suits: little furry Magical Native Americans (tm), or at least someone's warped view thereof. It feels like it's trying to be Watership Down with cats, but seems to fail to realize the reason why Watership Down is so awesome is because the Watership rabbits are RABBITS: they're not human, th Wow, this is a dumb book. My main gripe here is that these characters are not cats. Despite the grumblings about twolegs etc, they really don't think like small, semi-social predators. These are humans in cat suits: little furry Magical Native Americans (tm), or at least someone's warped view thereof. It feels like it's trying to be Watership Down with cats, but seems to fail to realize the reason why Watership Down is so awesome is because the Watership rabbits are RABBITS: they're not human, they don't think like humans, they're their own unique culture underground and have uniquely lapine problems. It almost would have been better, or at least more honest, if the characters were anthros or something, but aside from being xenofiction that doesn't put enough thought into actually being xenofic, the main character is an insufferable little Marty Stu. So much wasted potential. Kitty xenofiction has been done and done much better. If you can find it, try out The Wild Road and compare and contrast. ...more Warriors in my opinion was a very good book. The plot of the story was very interesting. Every time that something important or astonishing happen it hooks you more into the book. Its begging is okay but the end was good because it tells you things that you didn\u2019t know. The situations that occur in the story are incredible and you will like them even more if you imagined it. The cat in the story wants to change his life to do adventures things and that is maybe one of the reasons the author writ Warriors in my opinion was a very good book.

It is hard to remember all the characters and some times to keep track of what are the things that happening but in time you will know them well. The cats respect the rules lay down by the star clan cats. I won\u2019t tell who the star clan cats are because it might ruin some parts of the story. In conclusion this story is very interesting and I highly recommended. ...more For generations, four Clans of wild cats have shared the forest according to the laws laid down by their warrior ancestors.

I've always loved reading, but this is one of the first books I can really remember absolutely devouring. I believe the series isn't what it used to be after 100+ books, but this first arc and the journey we go on with Fireheart will always remain one of my favorites. I've read it countless times and never get tired of it. This book is the very first in the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. In a forest four clans of wild cats live in constant turmoil.

This book focuses on ThunderClan, and an apprentice named Firepaw who joins that clan. ...more For the first book in a never ending series, it's awesome! The explaining of the world of warriors could be a little more spread out and more settle. The plot was very interesting and cool. Firepaw and his friends have no idea the adventures that lie ahead. If your looking for a long, addicting, series then start reading. I finally got around to reading this due to a kindle daily deal which I caved to. I remember hearing about this series when I was a young crazed cat lover. At the age I currently am, I probably would have given this book three stars, but I know a younger version of me would have absolutely loved it so I gave it an extra star based on that. Into the wild is about a kitty-pet (cat that lives with humans) named Rusty who always has dreams of the forest. Then one day when he ventures into the forest he met up with some wild cats. When they offer him to join their clan he decides he should. What happens to Rusty in the wild? Read. O.o I know this is a children's book but I absolutely loved it, though a fair amount of nostalgia may have gone into that decision. This is like Game of Thrones for children, but with cats! How could it get any better? Tigerclaw is the cat-version of Iago, and I'm in love. Read this with my 8 year old while my 10 year old continues on with the series. Did not expect a kids book about cats to be so mature and intriguing, but hey, everybody wants to be a cat .
