I read this quite awhile ago and don't remember much about it other than the fact that I WANTED TO STRANGLE this girl at the end of the book. What a disappointment for her to return to Wisconsin. Boo hiss. I don't think I've hated a character more in all my years of reading. And they made a movie out of this garbage? Probably appeals to any woman who has stayed in a loveless relationship out of guilt, as if that's a gift to the other.

That's what I imagine I might have felt reading this a decade ago. But now, I'm left with a sense of regret. Is it Carrie's, or is it mine? How amazing an artist is Packer that I have to ask. And, that I still don't know. Nothing can shake the sense that I've experienced greatness, and lost it. ...more UG! I can't put into words my utter disappointment with the main character Carrie. I actually wanted her to come to life so I could bitch slap her. I don't want to divulge too much for I might ruin the ending for those who want to read it (please don't). The story had merit, the writing was good, but the ending was utterly incomprehensible to me. I actually felt trapped as if the main character were making life decisions for me.

I could decide if I sympathized with the main character or hated her. The pivotal event happens so early in the book (i.e. page 5 or so) that I had no connection to the characters before I saw them \"change\" due to grave circumstances. One character is purposefully enigmatic, but as hard as it is for the heroine to get to know Kilroy, it is even harder for the reader to connect - or care. Somehow, I liked this book. It is smoothly written and it was nice to see the heroine take on New York City with wide, naive Midwestern eyes. But while I sympathized with Carrie Bell for the situations she found herself in, it did not seem like her actions were legitimate reactions to the events of her life. ...more Carrie Bell feels the pull of a new life awaiting her outside her Wisconsin hometown.

But unexpectedly, despite her happiness in NY and a new career looming, she finds herself being pulled back to Madison. The book leaves you in genuine suspense as to whether Carrie will abandon Mike for a new life or will she turn her back on her own needs and settle down to do the \"right thing\". And who is it the \"right thing\" for? This was one of those books that I looked at and thought, \"I really should read that\" and didn't read it because I thought that way. I hate books that I should read. I hate the pressure of the world's expectations weighing on me as I read a book that it seems everyone else in the world likes. Now, in general, there's a reason why everyone tends to like those books, and it's that they're genuinely good books. This book was no exception. And usually I have a HUGE quibble with people who write about NYC. (see below) But even in this book, the usual pretentiousness of a writer writing about NY disappeared into one great story. I couldn't put the book down. It was great. I was genuinely conflicted as to what Carrie should do. And I was pleased, overall, with the way it came out in the end. I wish I could write as well. ...more I hated this book with a passion.

It\u2019s with real surprise she finds that, at age twenty-three, her life has begun to feel suffocating. She longs for a change, an upheaval, for a chance to begin again. That chance is granted to her, terribly, when Mike is injured in an accident. Now Carrie has to question everything she thought she knew about herself and the meaning of home. She must ask: How much do we owe the people we love? Is it a sign of strength or of weakness to walk away from someone in need? The Dive from Clausen\u2019s Pier reminds us how precarious our lives are and how quickly they can be divided into before and after, whether by random accident or by the force of our own desires. It begins with a disaster that could happen, out of the blue, in anybody\u2019s life, and it forces us to ask how we would bear up in the face of tragedy and what we know, or think we know, about our deepest allegiances. Elegantly written and ferociously paced, emotionally nuanced and morally complex, The Dive from Clausen\u2019s Pier marks the emergence of a prodigiously gifted new novelist. ...more i wanted to like this. i started out liking it but by the time i was wrapped up in it, i realized how trite it was. i grew up near madison and kept trying to find connection to the characters and places. i just kept thinking \"why would people like her?\" and \"who the fuck would be friends with these people?\" - everyone was a cliche, or not very detailed. no one talks or acts like these people, especially 23-year-olds. i really like the premise of the book - your fiance is in an accident and now a i wanted to like this. i started out liking it but by the time i was wrapped up in it, i realized how trite it was. i grew up near madison and kept trying to find connection to the characters and places. i just kept thinking \"why would people like her?\" and \"who the fuck would be friends with these people?\" - everyone was a cliche, or not very detailed. no one talks or acts like these people, especially 23-year-olds. i really like the premise of the book - your fiance is in an accident and now a parapalegic, what do you do? - but carrie, the main character, is really lame and does random things without explanation or care. and all of the sex scenes were written in a really awkward and laughingly weird way. why am i giving it three stars? i finished it, and a lot of the writing is strong, and it wasn't what i expected it to be. when i finished i read a lot of really angry - and funny - reviews on amazon. it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. ...more While this isn't classic literature, I was touched by the book.

Would she loyally proceed with the plan to eventually marry Mike and become his cook, nurse, helper, chauffeur, attendant and somehow his wife? Or would she be the kind of person who would willingly walk away and break the heart of a nice guy? We learn about ourselves in stages: facts first, meanings later. And so it was for Carrie. She made her decision, and wondered afterwards what that decision said about her and what kind of person she was. How much do we owe someone we love? Is it a strength or a weakness to walk away from someone in need? Carrie's choice ultimately wasn't about right or wrong or about defining herself; her task was to define her choice, and to recognize and accept who she was. I am the wife of a man who became disabled in an accident. Ann Packer is dead on in her portrayal of the painful questions, trials, and decisions that face an individual and family when a random, tragic accident forever changes life into before and after. I know how in an instant life can change forever; it forces you to personally face how you bear up in the face of tragedy and to examine what you thought you knew about your deepest allegiances. ...more I don't think that I would have stumbled upon this book had my friend not recommended it to me.

When she is considering making a life change, destiny makes it for her. Her boyfriend (now fiance) of 8 years takes a plunge from Clausen's Pier, breaks his neck and becomes a quadriplegic. He cannot move his hands, has no sexual sensitivity and is going through his own sort of depression. She must now struggle between what society says that she must do and her own fears and doubts. I think that the themes explored in this book are applicable to any living human being. Though we may not have to face this exact scenario, we all have to make difficult decisions in life even when some of those decisions seem to have been already made for us. I was, however, unsatisfied with Carrie's eventual development as a person. I feel that she never fully understood herself as an individual and only understood how she was in relation to a romantic interest. I kept assuming that this would eventually happen, but perhaps it does. We can't expect a full resolution in such a short time span since all of us are always searching for better self-awareness. ...more I picked this one up at a yard sale for 50 cents and I'm glad I didn't pay more.

Carrie and Mike had been dating since high school. Now, 5 or so years later, she's realized that her life in small town Wisconsin is suffocating her and is ready to make a break. One problem, on a holiday with friends, Mike takes a dive off a pier into shallow water- and ends up paralyzed. Should our desires and needs be sacrificed out of obligation to what others think we should do? Is pity a good enough reason when the love isn't there anymore? These are the questions none of us ever hope to have to ponder- but ones Carrie does from the onset of the story. Through most of the book, part of me was as disgusted with Carrie as her friends were when she took off into the night choosing her wants over her old love's needs. Another part of me wanted her to do it. But that wasn't what bugged me about the book- in fact the exploration of \"What Would You Do in a Similar Situation\" is what kept me reading. My annoyance was in the fact that Packer rambled on and on allowing Carrie to wallow in self-pity so much so you wanted to shake her. She drew Carrie's life in NYC out so long I wanted to throw the book against the wall, because I knew damn well Carrie had to go back and confront the mess she left behind. And even THAT would have been okay with me- if it weren't for the fact Carrie wasn't making any self discoveries while separated from the situation. True, the author gave Carrie new relationships in NYC, but she didn't really develop them enough to make the book more interesting. Oh Carrie started dating again while there- and the man she chose had so many secrets you wanted to scream- but the author never really gave me the answers as to why to satisfy me either. (I felt like the proverbial donkey being led along by a carrot that will never be attained.) Carrie's entire time in NYC was just needless filler as far as I'm concerned- filler that could have added so much more to the story if we had gotten inside Carrie's head instead of watching her walk around seemingly ignoring what was really going on. Carrie eventually does go back to Wisconsin and we do read the ending which could not have ended any other way, however, after being led down so many meandering paths for so long, I didn't really care. I threw the book against the wall anyway. ...more This book was recommended to me by a friend. She loved it. I hated it.

Wish I had back the time it took out of my life to read this. The worst things about this book: 1. I simply did NOT find the actions, thoughts, and dialogue believable for a young woman of her age. 2. The NYC stuff was beyond ridiculous and not even remotely realistic. Maybe it would have been better if she'd been the one crippled instead of her boyfriend. She has so many emotional problems including being both a control freak and a giant martyr that I just hated her. I'm still haunted by this story. It's about a young couple in their early 20s living in the midwest-- Wisconsin (I think). They've been dating since high school.

(spoiler) Running away from the situation, Carrie flees to New York City (from Madison, WI) and begins a new relationship with someone she feels a deeper emotional and intellectual connection with. After pursuing her dreams and falling in love, she gets sucked back into the blackhole of Madison and abandons everyone who loves and has helped her in New York in favor of \"trying to make things right\" in WI. This was just an immensely frustrating plot line. When Carrie first moves to New York, you get excited for her - she has finally escaped her social confines, emerging from her chrysalis as a strong and beautiful butterfly ready to take on New York. You can feel the hope Ann Packer puts into the pages - Carrie seems so happy and at peace (mostly) with her life in New York. Yet, in the last 100 pages when Carrie decides to return to Madison to try to patch up a devastated friendship and tease Mike more, it is almost heart breaking. You watch this girl simply throw her life away because, for lack of better word, she is weak. She NEVER stands up for herself, and she simply lets other people guilt trip and manipulate her into conforming to her will. She ends up unhappy at the end with no best friend (even though they are speaking, they will never be able to regain what they had), no boyfriend, no money, no job, no peace of mind, and lots of regrets. Carrie Bell epitomizes the woman I hope never to become. This book does have its moments of clarity - Packer captures the heartbreak and overwhelming sense of insecurity of a girl released from a confining and doomed relationship. For someone just coming out of a relationship that they knew was not right, the first 2/3 of this book are empathetic and insightful and may offer comfort. However, the last 1/3 of the book is so morbidly depressing and weak that I would NOT recommend this to someone looking for hope after a long relationship. I really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. People who have never been in a long term relationship will find this book to be trivial and nonsensical, people in relationships will find it depressing, and people out of relationships will find it frustrating. The only reason this book received a 2 star was because Ann Packer's writing style is captivating and well done. However, she deserves a sharp reprimand for such an unrealistic and incongruous ending. ...more The book was entertaining in an easy-read kind of way.

Her guilt is exacerbated by the fact that she had been gradually falling out of love with him in the months prior. The story felt hackneyed in many parts: the \"I couldn't help but wonder\" moments; the vague \"it wasn't that, nor did I know what it was.\" Carrie is an annoying character, but if everyone could read their own internal dialogue on paper, I'm sure it'd be annoying as well. Regardless, it's hard not to sympathize with her given the circumstances she's having to face. I did, however, feel vindicated whenever another character tried to get her out of her selfishness. She deserved a serious reality check. Her New York boyfriend Kilroy pissed the shit out of me for sure. He's an elitist, self-absorbed trust-fund baby who is supposed to be heroic because he's denied the wealthy part of his life. He wears a denim shirt and I just picture a Midwesterner lost in Manhattan. He's evasive and cryptic, and I'm surprised he actually expressed such distraught over Carrie's decision to stay in Wisconsin. He begs her to return to New York, doesn't understand why she has to patch things up with her best friend -- \"why not write her a long letter?\" -- or her ex. Then he seems to have a change of heart: \"At this point,\" I said, \"I don't know why I'm even still here.\" \"I do.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you're you...Isn't it obvious? You can't leave because you're the person you are, and I can't want you to because that would be wanting you to be someone else when I want you to be you.\" That is, until 17 pages later, the next time Kilroy is mentioned, where he goes from \"somewhat unhappy state of understanding\" to \"a more irritable state of wanting to know why I had to resolve everything at once.\" So he CLEARLY wants her to be her. This book was written in 2002 and it's hard for me to remember what technology was like back then. I'm pretty sure I was on AIM until the very late hours of the morning in 2002. These characters are 23, and had just graduated from college (U of WI) where I'm sure they were not sheltered from email. Still, they were sending telegrams, writing letters, and leaving notes. It felt so archaic. Another thing that bothered me? Mike has a mustache. ...more Rarely have I cared so much about a character: Carrie Bell is faced with the gut-wrenching decision of staying with her boyfriend, Mike, of 7 years after he has become a quadriplegic.

Making matters even more complicated, in the months just before the accident she had begun to fall out of love with Mike. Carrie is emotionally paralyzed with fear of making the wrong decision: \"How much do we owe the people we love?...What I had discovered was that I couldn't give up my life for Mike--that how I saw it at the time, that's the choice I thought I had to make. And because I couldn't give up everything, I also thought I couldn't give up anything.\" These ruminations occur as she finally decides to drive on whim to New York, chasing after a gay high school friend who has moved there to be accepted and Kilroy, a man she happens to meet at a dinner, who immediately and incisively reads her. The inevitable romance in New York with Kilroy reminds me in style of Woody Allen's Manhattan--it's as much a love affair with city as it is with Kilroy. Yet the same person who could not stay on as the dutiful girlfriend with the paraplegic boyfriend, cannot quite restart her life in New York as a fashion designer and girlfriend of the beautiful yet indecipherable Kilroy. Carrie returns to her small home town to, as it were, set things straight. But it's much more complicated than she expected. And the decisions Carrie makes are what make this novel \"hard\" art instead of \"soft\" art, using the distinction Kilroy uses at the MoMA between Picasso and Matisse. And, I believe, this hard edge is what has many 30 something women (unofficial conclusion based off some Goodread reviews) hating Carrie and even the novel. I was frustrated, even devastated, but I never hated her; maybe it's easier as a man to step back and see her decisions as simply the complex weaving of human responsibility, desire, and identity. ...more ****This review contains SPOILERS**** This is the story of Carrie Bell, a recent college graduate who's life seems to be at a stand-still.

She's got a fiance Mike, who she's been with since they were 14, a mediocre job at the University Library, a group of friends she's had since high school who are equally at a stand-still. But she begins to question her life. Just as she's about to ask, \"Is this it? Is this the life I'm destined to lead?,\" tragedy strikes. Her fiance dives into shallow water and ends up paralyzed from the chest down. Everything changes in an instant. But as much as she wants to be there for Mike, she finds herself looking for an escape plan. Things had been chilly between the two of them in the months before the accident, but how can she leave him now? What will people think? What will she think of herself? Then she does the unthinkable... she leaves, getting as far away from her old life as she can. This was an interesting read. It was definitely darker than I expected. I've read some reviews where people had no sympathy for Carrie, but I believe she's worthy of sympathy. She is in an impossible situation, where everyone wants to see her as this rock for Mike, his stability in an unstable situation. But that's a lot to ask someone at any age, let alone at age 23, when you were already contemplating life without your fiance and an accident leaves him paralyzed. The author did a great job of showing how tormented Carrie was by her actions, her decisions, and their consequences. I was disappointed by the ending of the book, because although Carrie did grow, she ended up right back where she started. I think it would have been a much more interesting story if Carrie had resolved things with Mike, with her best friend, and her mother and then headed back to NYC to make a new life for herself. That's my only beef with the book. ...more This book surprised me. I initially wrote it off, expecting that it would fall into the Lifetime movie category of contemporary fiction. Ironically, a Google search did inform me that it has had a second life as an honest-to-goodness Lifetime movie (or maybe it was Oxygen; I wasn't paying that close of attention). For emotion-centric, literary fiction, it was jarringly suspenseful. I almost wanted to hide it under my desk at work, on my lap, to finish it.

Ironically, a Google search did inform me that it has had a second life as an honest-to-goodness Lifetime movie (or maybe it was Oxygen; I wasn't paying that close of attention). For emotion-centric, literary fiction, it was jarringly suspenseful. I almost wanted to hide it under my desk at work, on my lap, to finish it. I felt desperate to figure out how Carrie's story ends, and I felt an unexpected urgency about whether the \"right\" thing would happen in her life--although I can't exactly figure out what the right thing is, what I want her life to be like. There were things I didn't really like in it, or that frustated me, but I don't really feel like focusing on that. The characterization could seem contrived in terms of traits and actions, but in terms of emotional realism and resonance--it was masterful. Criticisms aside, this was an incredibly poignant and surprisingly rich work, a moving story of loss and self discovery. This might be a case of the right book with the right emotional tone at the right time. A cathartic read. ...more This was a very good book. It takes place in the Midwest and is about a woman named Carrie who is about 25 years old at the beginning. She is planning to get married to her childhood sweetheart, Mike, whom she has been with 'forever'. But her big secret is...she doesn't really want to marry him. Her feelings towards him have cooled, and she doesn't know how to tell him. He is very much in love with her.

Her feelings towards him have cooled, and she doesn't know how to tell him. He is very much in love with her. One day, when they are hanging out at the pier with their friends, Mike jumps in the lake and breaks his neck, becoming quadriplegic. The book just kept surprising me over and over again from there. The characters are very real, the setting is very real. Even though Carrie's feelings and reactions to what happens to Mike are not what people expect, and not what she wants them to be \u2013 they are honest. I loved the way the book kept me guessing, and the way in which no one was a caricature, they were all fully fleshed out, living, breathing individuals. I felt like I had known any one of these people. An excellent book \u2013 I would highly recommend it. ...more I couldn't really relate to any of the characters in this book, so no matter what situations they got themselves in (and the main character did nothing BUT get in situations), I found myself reading on more to find out how the author would get them out than what the actual characters would do.

Those were its strong points. I think it can be difficult for people--both myself and as is evident in the reviews of others--to separate how striking and sad a topic this is--and how potentially realistic its ending is--from whether they thought the book was good. If the characters in a book disappoint you over and over in exactly the way ones in real life do, does that make the book masterfully real, or just disappointing?

If the characters in a book disappoint you over and over in exactly the way ones in real life do, does that make the book masterfully real, or just disappointing? My own conclusion is that while Packer has a gift for relaying emotion, she has less of one for storytelling. Not only does the book drag in the middle, where for more than a hundred pages you're made to try to care about a previously unimportant character and his \"mysterious\" hang-ups, as well as Carrie's tediously-detailed interest in a career in fashion--but then the ending just makes you sad, and not in a poignant way. Carrie leaves a man and a life that made her feel alive and sexy and empowered to go back and be near the paralyzed ex she wanted to leave in the first place. She tells him, in what is perhaps the most cringeworthy moment of the book, that the engagement ring he gave her, which she still wears, is \"a friendship ring now,\" as if he's going to be excited about her halfhearted promise to spend the rest of her life platonically hanging out with him and her old friends in Madison. That's when you realize Carrie spent the entire book being almost unbelievably self-involved: not because she left, which was the right thing to do, but because she couldn't get out of her own head, her own pity-me feelings, and her own obsession with whether people think she's being a good person long enough to actually be one. Her ex didn't need the woman he hoped to marry hanging around reminding him of all he'd lost for the rest of his life, especially when Packer never convinces us that Carrie truly wants to be there or is good at acting like she does. Is this exactly what might happen in real life? Absolutely. Does that make this a good book? No. ...more Definitely the best book I read on my weekend vacation.

The main character just wasn't all that interesting to me. Partly I think what annoyed me about her is that she had a habit of defining herself through the men in her life. She had obvious issues with abandonment with her father leaving her at a young age. When she is faced with having to choose whether or not to leave her injured boyfriend (which she was planning to do before the accident) to me it was a no brainer.

I remember loving this book and listing it as one of my all-time favorites. Now I'm not sure why, as this time around I was so annoyed with Carrie (the main character) and didn't find much in here to be realistic or inspiring in any way. I enjoyed all the supporting characters and their stories, but I'm relieved the twenty-something me didn't follow in any of their paths. ugh.
