I didn't know what to expect about this book written by the magical J.K. Rowling about the \"history\" of the magic sport of Quidditch. However, I was happily surprised that while some chapters explaining the rules of the \"sport\" are kinda tiresome, they were the few, since other chapters were really amusing and entertaining. You \"learn\" why the decission of using brooms to fly. Also, you \"learn\" about the official Quidditch teams on the British league, but even also you will learn about how popular or not is this sport in other countries and continents. It's a book written with the heart of Rowling allowing to appreciate an important element of the magical world of Harry Potter beyond of what you may knew about on the book series.<---F> You won't be dissapointed</---F>... ...and don't let go away that Golden Snitch!!! ...more \u201cI've read worse.\u201d - Rita Skeeter on <+++>Quidditch Through the Ages</+++> I love this super witty and funny companion to the Harry Potter books.

Mohammed Arabey 3 April 2013 16 April 2013 ...more This was awesome! I can't believe I've never read it before! I gave this 5 out of 5 not because it was a phenomenal work of literary fiction, but because of the time and effort that J.K. Rowling put into creating this amazing sport, the history, the teams, the rules, everything is phenomenally done! I love Quidditch, and being a total sports nerd this was perfect for me. The coolest thing for me was when the book discussed Canadian teams and a team called the Moose Jaw Meteorites were mentioned. This was awesome! I can't believe I've never read it before!

The coolest thing for me was when the book discussed Canadian teams and a team called the Moose Jaw Meteorites were mentioned. They are a team that after they win they fly around with fiery sparks coming from their broom ends in magical formations which is highly anticipated by the viewers. Moose Jaw is a town not far from where I live and they have planes called Snowbirds that fly together in the most amazing formations and people from all over come to watch. J.K. Rowling really put in her all with this by diving into the research. I definitely suggest this if you're interested in learning more about this magical sport, and just as a little extra Harry Potter read! 5 out of 5! ...more Slightly better than FB, this one reads like a long a boring textbook on the history of a wizarding game. But that's probably because it's exactly that. :) Don't get me wrong. It's fascinating in its way, but I've never cared much for ANY kind of sports history. It bores me to tears. :) At least this has magic, no? It's written well. It still just happens to be a short history. Ver en la lista de pr\u00e9stamos del libro el nombre de Cedric Diggory y llorar a mares. Just like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , this is an informative book. We get to learn the history of Quidditch (<---B>a popular sport in the Wizarding World.</---B>), other games using Broomsticks, Quidditch Teams, Game rules etc.. It's really a fascinating read and I enjoyed it :) EVERYTHING IS NOSTALGIC. Funnier and more interesting than Fantastic Beasts . Also, it read more like a genuine Hogwarts text book than Fantastic Beasts did, which was just basically a giant list with a brief summary of various creatures. This had far more magic and history and information in it.

Postoji toliko detalja koji su fantasti\u010dni i koji mame osmeh na lice, ali ipak bih izdvojila timove koji igraju za Britaniju i Irsku, kao i opise popularnih poteza koje \u010darobnjaci i ve\u0161tice imaju prilike da gledaju na utakmicama.

This was bad! I could have died if I didn't skip like 20 pages! This contained so many unnecessary details!!!! Yeah there were some interesting facts that I enjoyed but most of the book was blah blah blah I hate that I rated 2 stars to a book that belongs to my all time favorite book series But I had to! Fun to read for fans of the Harry Potter series! I am now a loyal fan of the Quidditch team The Chudley Cannons. Their change of motto from 'We shall conquer' to 'Let's all just keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best' is hilarious Fantastic quick read on Qudditch. Go Puddlemere United! \u201cUndoubtedly the most skilled Quidditch nation in South America is Peru, which is tipped to become the first Latin World Cup winner within ten years.\u201d why am i weirdly proud of peru LOL 3,5 stars Quidditch: the best fictional sport ever!! To be honest I hate sports, and I hate people who like sports, and I hate people who like people who like sports. Nah, joking. I just suck at P.E, and I'm terrible in anything related to it, including sports rules, etc. But this book is an exeption; I enjoyed it a lot, it was funny and entretaining. Its hard to believe that such a thin book took me more than two months to finish. To conclude, now I understand why Harry and Ron loved Quiddich. Much better than Fantastic Beasts. \u201cMadam Pince, our librarian, tells me that it is 'pawed about, dribbled on, and generally maltreated' nearly everyday - a high compliment for any book.\u201d ---- Das war eigentlich ein re-read, da ich das Buch bereits mit 10 oder 11 schon mal gelesen habe, mich aber nicht mehr erinnern konnte. Quidditch war ja nie das spannendste f\u00fcr mich an den Potter B\u00fcchern, aber der einmalige Witz und Charme haben mich dann doch einigerma\u00dfen \u00fcberzeugt. 3.9/5 stars This review is originally posted on The Bookish Girl -- Brutal yet exciting, Quidditch is a sport that we all love.

From the transformation of the game, to its rules, famous teams and different types of fouls!

Like there is a little sheet keeping track of all the borrowers and Miss Prince's -- The Hogwarts librarian -- funny warning to students who damage the book. The little reviews by different wizards are so funny that I couldn't help but chuckle. I love how they include these little details to make this book \"real\". If you are a true Potterhead, I highly recommend this book to you for it allows you to get to know the wizard world better. A Potterhead simply couldn't resist a book that is related to Harry Potter *wink*. And if you haven't read the Harry Potter books? I seriously urge you to read them first and come back for this! I would cast a spell to make you read them if I could ;) \u00a9thebookishgirl -- You can get the book from Bookdepository ...more Just like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them this is a really fun companion book to the Harry Potter world.

It was fun to see how the game developed over the centuries, and to hear about some of the most famous teams (the one about the Wigtown Wanderers made me laugh... that Walter and his meat cleaver... oh goodness.)

We get so much interesting insight in the making of broomsticks, the history and development of Quidditch (from the first game ever payed to the one we know and love nowadays) and we learn a lot about the different positions, fouls and teams.
