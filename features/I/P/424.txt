A lot of it is valid, but there are certain times that he\u2019s the perfect author to be reading. Like last night when a winter storm blew through. Freezing temperatures, snow, ice, and high winds made it look like an Artic wasteland outside. As I lay reading under my warm blankets, I paused for a moment and listened to the wind making the house creak and the sleet hitting the windows, and thought, \u201cThis is just about the perfect setting to be reading a Stephen King book.\u201d The fact that it was a very damn good Stephen King book was an excellent bonus. As if to give us a break after recent high page count books like Under the Dome and Duma Key , King delivers four short-n-sweet novellas focusing on the nastier sides of people with just a hint of the supernatural. These are four tales about the lives we build that we tell ourselves our safe, sane and secure, but there\u2019s always darkness lurking at the edges. King points out that sometimes we\u2019re the ones who invite that darkness in. In 1922 , a Depression-era farmer in the Midwest just wants to work with his son and read books in the evening, but his wife wants to sell some land her father left her to a hog factory and use the money to move to the city. When the two can\u2019t reach an agreement, the farmer decides to murder her and hide the body in an old well. Even worse, he manipulates his son into helping. What results is a chilling story of the unintended consequences that one crime and the ensuing guilt can cause. Big Driver features Tess, an author who writes cozy mysteries about a group of elderly amateur female detectives that are popular with grandma-types. Taking a short cut home from a speaking/signing engagement, a flat tire leads to Tess being raped and left for dead. After escaping, Tess realizes that since she\u2019s a quasi-celebrity going to the police would result in a media firestorm that would taint the rest of her life so she decides to seek her own revenge. Dave Streeter is a man with terminal cancer who gets a mysterious offer for fifteen more healthy years of life in Fair Extension , but he has to nominate someone to get a heaping dose of bad luck in his place. Since he\u2019s got a lot of resentment and grudges against his best friend Tom and his perfect life, Streeter decides that his old buddy deserves some misfortune. The question in A Good Marriage is how well do you know your spouse? Darcy and Bob have been together 25 years and if things are a bit dull and ordinary at this point, they\u2019ve built a good life and are generally content. When Bob\u2019s away on business, Darcy goes looking for batteries in the garage and discovers a horrifying secret that her husband has been keeping. This is some of the best stuff that King has done in years. By focusing on human nature rather than supernatural monsters, he was able to create some very relatable yet scary stories. We know that we won\u2019t really be trapped in old hotels filled with ghosts or live in a town overrun by vampires or chased by demon cars that drive themselves. But getting a flat tire on a lonely road? Finding a dark secret about a spouse? Being jealous of a friend doing better than yourself? Watching your life unravel because of a bad decision you\u2019ve tried to hide? Those are things that we really fear, and King uses them all skillfully to deliver some of his creepiest stories yet. ...more 1922: A man coerces his son into helping him murder his wife. Can they keep their sanity in the aftermath? 1922 is a latter day retelling of A Telltale Heart, only with rats and a Bonnie and Clyde side-story. It's also damn good and a prime example of what Stephen King can do when he has a limited number of pages to work with instead of the entire paper output of a redwood forest.

Big Driver: After taking a shortcut down an unfamiliar road, a writer is raped and left in a culvert to die but her attacker made a mistake.<---F> He let her live</---F>... Wow, this was a powerful, dark, unsettling tale of rape and revenge. Did I mention it was uncomfortable? A woman getting raped is much more horrifying than a nightmare clown lurking in the sewers. I kept having revenge fantasies of my own on behalf of the women in my life while reading this. Fair Extension: When a mysterious stranger offers Harry Streeter 15-20 more years of life, he jumps at the chance. But with deals of this kind, there's always a catch... This one kind of reminds me of The Monkey's Paw. For all the good luck the Streeter family has, shit rains down upon the man Streeter hates the most. A Good Marriage: Darcy Anderson thought she had a good marriage until she found something her husband hid in their garage... The point this story drives home is how little anyone really knows anyone else. Chilling and very effective. <+++>Full Dark, No Stars</+++> isn't my favorite King book but it's chock full of Kingliness and is an excellent example of what sai King can do when he isn't allowed to write phonebook sized tomes.

Often, even. But I think they also say that nobility most fully resides not in success but in trying to do the right thing . . \" 1922 King's first novella is a treat of a story, a family who live on a farm with their fates in Kings hand to twist. A story of the darkness of the soul, the evil of what we do and the consequences of our actions. To what extent would you go to preserve the way things exist instead of moving to the big city? The novella starts with this statment. \"My name is Wilfred Leland James, and this is my confession. In June of 1922 I murdered my wife, Arlette Christina Winters James, and hid her body by tipping it down an old well.\" also some more good excerpts.. \"Here is something I learned in 1922: there are always worse things waiting. You think you have seen the most terrible thing, the one that coalesces all your nightmares into a freakish horror that actually exists, and the only consolation is that there can be nothing worse. Even if there is, your mind will snap at the sight of it, and you will know no more. But there is worse, your mind does not snap, and somehow you carry on. You might understand that all the joy has gone... \" \" The Conniving Man out-connived: how do you like that?\" Big Driver This story has themes of redemption and atonement. A mystery writer finds herself caught up in her own real life investigation. This story touches you with warmth and compassion for victims of rape and how hard it is for victim to report the crime, the idea of people finding out you have been raped is frightening as the crime. It makes you think about taking the wrong turn being in wrong place at the wrong time. The National Crime Victimization Survey says, because I googled it. Sixty percent of rapes go unreported, according to them. Three in every five. I think that might be low, but who can say for sure?\" \" . . . what she says once in every book: murderers always overlook the obvious.\" Fair Extension This is the shorter of the four stories its about a twist of fates fortunate become unfortunate and vice versa. I was thinking about the Goodhughs. I\u2019ve never known a family to have such a run of bad luck. Bad luck?\u2019 She laughed. \u2018Black luck is more like it.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018Life is fair. We all get the same nine-month shake in the box, and then the dice roll. Some people get a run of sevens. Some people, unfortunately, get snake-eyes. It\u2019s just how the world is.\u2019 A Good Marriage This was a gripping story, it made you think, do you really know what your partners up to? If you found out how would you deal with it? The kids, the press, lives could be destroyed. He loved nothing, least of all her. Every kindness, caress, boyish grin, and thoughtful gesture \u2013 all were nothing but camouflage. He was a shell. There was nothing inside but howling emptiness. \u201d \"She dreamed of going into the dining room and finding a woman bound with chains to the long Ethan Allen table there. The woman was naked except for a black leather hood that covered the top half of her face. I don\u2019t know that woman, that woman is a stranger to me, she thought in her dream, and then from beneath the hood Petra said: \u2018Mama, is that you?\" \"It\u2019s a mistake, it has to be, we\u2019ve been married over half our lives, I\u2019d know, I would know. Opening the box. Thinking, Does anybody really know \u201d \"A marriage was like a house under constant construction, each year seeing the completion of new rooms. A first-year marriage was a cottage; one that had gone on for twenty-seven years was a huge and rambling mansion. There were bound to be crannies and storage spaces, most of them dusty and abandoned, some containing a few unpleasant relics you would just as soon you hadn\u2019t found. But that was no biggie. You either threw those relics out or took them to Goodwill. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s what drug addicts say. \u2018I\u2019ll never take any of that stuff again. I\u2019ve quit before and this time I\u2019ll quit for good. I mean it.\u2019 But they don\u2019t mean it, even when they think they do they don\u2019t, and neither does he. \u201d \"The refrigerator whirred, the water dripped in the sink, and the raw seconds passed.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS 1. 1922 - This story is actually a confession of a man who has just murdered his wife.

I feel this story makes you realize that our actions have consequences that we will somehow at some point feel. Is it karma? What goes around, comes around? Ghosts? Insanity? This man, after committing this heinous crime feels the repercussions in everything breaking down around him. Is he losing his mind? Is he being haunted by his wife? This story in many ways reminds me of King's short story Morality (included w/ Blockade Billy), where one action of a woman completely alter the rest of her life. (5 stars) 2. Big Driver - Now this story was very unlike what I know of Uncle Stevie! That being said, I loved it! This is the story of Tessa, a well-known mystery writer who is on her way from a speaking engagement when she is viciously attacked, raped and left for dead. That's horrible enough, right? But this story follows her in how she handles this life-changing situation. This story is incredibly moving and she is an amazingly strong, resilient woman....much to her own surprise. I could not put this story down at all! (5 stars) 3. Fair Extension - This book left me a bit torn. Dave Streeter is your average family man with a wife and kids. Dave, however, is dying of cancer and is slowly watching his body deteriorate and his life crumble around him. He comes upon an odd, pudgy little man named George Elvid sitting on the side of the road looking like someone peddling his wares.....however there were no wares. He sells extensions......even a hair extension if that's what Dave wants. But what does Dave want? And what is the cost? This was very well done, who would expect anything less from Uncle Stevie? lol. But I felt left wanting like the story wasn't finished. Or was it? Maybe the rest is for us to think about......was this right or wrong? Maybe too much information wouldn't let us work this one out in our head more. It definitely leaves me w/ alot of questions. (4 stars) 4. A Good Marriage - This story was about a woman named Darcy Anderson, who has a pretty charmed life....the good husband and 2 beautiful children. Her husband by all appearances is a mild-mannered accountant, and even volunteers for the boy scouts. They have been married fo 27 years and she thought she knew him pretty well, until she uncovered a secret hiding place of his in the garage. He has a secret that will change everything! This story follows Darcy's discovery and how she handles the nightmare that her life becomes. I really liked this story and respected Darcy very much. (5 stars) **UPDATE** Ok, now with the release of the paperback book, also came the addition of an previously unpublished short story called Under The Weather. All I can say is OMG! I had no idea where this story was going and then all of a sudden I was like \"You're $#!@$#! kidding me!\" Yup, it's that kind of punchline! This one is possibly one of the best stories in the book. Now I don't want to say too much about this little treasure, but it's the story of a man, who is under a lot of stress due to work, recurring nightmares that he can't explain and a sick wife. Read this short little gem....you'll be glad you did. ...more \u0631\u062c\u0644\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0629..\u0643\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a

Some have become new favorites. But no matter how enjoyable these authors' works are, none of them can compare to the security and enjoyment of going back to Stephen King. I often complain of being a relatively slow reader. But this is never the case with King. He has the wonderful gift of emotionally involving you into a story, coming to know and understand his characters, and when this happens, the mechanics of reading disappear. It becomes an immersion. In King's afterword (and I love that he does these), he explains exactly why his storytelling resonates with me perfectly: \"for those who substitute unbelievable behavior for the way people really act, I have nothing but contempt. Bad writing is more than a matter of shit syntax and faulty observation; bad writing usually arises from a stubborn refusal to tell stories about what people actually do.\" He may sound snarky out of context, but he's right. Personally, there is no way I can thoroughly enjoy a story if the characters' actions make no sense. I have tried to explain this in a couple of reviews I have written for two novels by a very popular horror writer here. I'm not going to mention his name, but the reason I don't care for his stories is because I feel that his main characters are idiots. Despite his talent for laying out a story, it was ruined for me because I didn't buy in to what the characters did, or their motivations. King gets it. (Okay, except for Under the Dome. I couldn't buy into where human nature went in that one, sorry Steve, we're off the common plane there, old friend.) With this collection, King returns to his excellent novella formula. Full Dark, No Stars is also a return to humankind's darkness, and also in his afterword, he explains that rather than have extraordinary characters in ordinary situations, he chooses to put ordinary people in extraordinary situations and see what happens. This is a recipe that yields stories that share the addictive quality of, \"I can't wait to see how this ends!\" So get comfy, sit back and enjoy four tales of harshness... 1922: This was a good story set in 1922, where a farmer comes to a final solution regarding his wife's insistence on selling their land off. After about 100 pages, I was beginning to feel that there were parts that dragged a bit, but King wrapped this one up with a high one, left center field, out of the park, off a windshield and into the river. I was left thinking about this one for a while. Big Driver: Oooh, this was a dark one. I think my posture is still suffering from my slack-jawed slouch as King pulled me through the story of a writer of cozy mysteries, and her trip back from a speaking engagement. After showing us his softer side over the past few years, our Stephen shows he still has dark things in the tank. I had a hard time putting this one down. Fair Extension: The shortest story in the book. This one reminded me a little of The Monkey's Paw, in that you may get what you desire, but in the grand balance of things, something must be taken to be given. Again, a tough one to put down. A Good Marriage: After 27 years of marriage, a woman discovers that her loving husband has a secret hobby. It's not good news. I was again hauled through this story mercilessly. Afterword: Probably the most terrifying part of this novel for me was learning that King still goes for his 4-5 mile walks along a road (he was hit by a van in 1999, for those of you who don't know), and that his favorite snack is a candybar and a soda. Firstly, if you ever read this, Steve, please stay off the roads. And knock off the white sugar (aka white death). I want you to stay healthy and keep writing for many more years. Walk in the woods, and eat plenty of Omega-3s, antioxidants and get your fibre.

When you have publishers considering 35,000 words \u201cnovel length\u201d, it makes you wonder what the actual difference is between a novel and a novella and whether or not the distinction will make a lot of difference in the coming years.

Buddy of mine, Gregor Xane, thinks novellas suit horror just fine, that they are the perfect length to bring on the scares and then GTFO of Dodge. I tend to agree with him. But there\u2019s something different about a King novella. They normally feel like novels twice their length. They feel packed to bursting with content. Think about Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption , think The Langoliers or The Mist . So once again, I wonder\u2026 What really makes a novel a novel. Is it truly length? Or the breadth of story? This collection is bleak. There\u2019s not a bright moment to be found, hence the title. Let\u2019s discuss what that entails, shall we? 1922 : Sweet baby Tom Cruise this story is disturbing. It\u2019s one of those tales that make you feel dirty after completing it. What Wilf and Hank do is irredeemable, but somehow, I feel bad for the both of them by story\u2019s end. That\u2019s damn good writing, if you ask me. That\u2019s having humanity nailed down to where it\u2019s likely never to move again. Big Driver : Rape. Does that word make you uncomfortable? Probably. Even if you\u2019re not a victim, or don\u2019t know a victim, you\u2019re liable to cringe just reading it. But what about \u2018revenge\u2019? Does that word make you smile? Well, even though the revenge in this tale is not easily won or pretty in nature, I still grin like a mad bastard reading about these fuckers getting their comeuppance. And speaking of the word \u2018rape\u2019, King uses it a lot in this story. He doesn't pull any punches. There\u2019s one page where it seems like every other word is that word. I feel he was trying to drive home the stark horror of the situation by pummeling us with repetition. \"You will read this. You will know. You will see .\" Fair Extension : The shortest of the tales, this one is my favorite. In King\u2019s short story, \u201cThe Man in the Black Suit\u201d, which appears in Everything\u2019s Eventual and won an O. Henry Award, King comes right out and tells us who the bad guy is. In this one, the story\u2019s more sinister for its allusions. You know who this guy is bartering with, I know who he\u2019s bartering with, even the character knows, but no one ever says it. Because that\u2019s what gives monsters their true power \u2013 acknowledgement. The boogeyman isn\u2019t scary until you believe he is. A Good Marriage : I love this one for its simple truths. You never truly know another human being, no matter how long you might live with them. King used the serial killer known as BTK for inspiration, and the reader is left wishing that this had been the actual outcome. In summation: In my opinion, King shines brightest when he\u2019s working with novellas. I can name numerous bad novels and short stories of his, but I can\u2019t think of a single novella from him that I\u2019ve disliked. What do you think? Can you name one, and why didn't you like it?

This does not mean that they lack emotion, intensity and darkness; oh no, the title is very apt. These four tales are some of King's darkest work to date. King one of the few contemporary and succesful practicioners in the vastly ignored field of the short story, but he's probably the sole writer who enjoys success by employing the form of the novella. This is his third collections of novellas, after Different Seasons (1982) and Four Past Midnight (1989). Different Seasons contains some of the best material he has done and this volume has been compared to it often, but the two do not go together. Different Seasons was the reflection of life and its passing years, Full Dark, No Stars dwelves deep into the chambers of the human heart, mind and soul and looks in the corners forgotten or deliberately locked. Different Seasons reflected the seasons of the year and the moods that came with them; here the darkness is unrelenting throughout the whole volume. Perhaps it is the subject matter that forms these stories that makes them so affecting: How well do you know your spouse? How can you cope with the envy that eats you inside? How far would you go to save what you think is the most important thing in your life? 1922 I believe that there is another man inside of every man, a stranger... This is the opening story, and in my opinion the best of the whole volume. It's a first person account of Wilfred James, who writes a lengty confession in which he admits to the murder of his wife, Arlette and the reasons that drove him to the crime. This is also the most atmospheric story, full of creaking floorboards, floating moles of dust that disturb the bleak sunlight, and of course the everpresent well, which is not at all empty. The time is 1922, and the place is Hermingford Home, Nebraska. Wilfred owns eighty acres of farmland, which was in his family for decades. Arlette owns a hundred adjoining acres willed to her by her father, but she is dissatisfied by farm life; she wants to move to Omaha, where she wants to open a dress shop. Wilfred does not want to hear about that, and when Arlette suggests that they sell the whole farm, split the money and divorce, what was beginning to be dislike morphs into hate. Wilfred is a sad, desperate man; he's also a conniving man, and even admits to that in the text. He blames his actions on the conniving man, whom he considers to be an almost separate entity; he tries to convince the reader that his actions and choices were the only ones availible, but more importantly he tries to convince himself and shut down his conscience. Beautifully written, graphic, tense and visceral 1922 unfolds like a Greek tragedy and arrives at a powerful closure. A definite favorite. Big Driver She took a few steps closer, raising a hand to her forehead to shade her eyes. YOU LIKE IT IT LIKES YOU. Which was a slogan for what, exactly? Can you have a more obvious storyline than a woman lost in the woods who gets attacked by a hostile stranger? Nope. Famous horror hacks like Richard Laymon based their whole creative output on this premise, movies like Friday the 13th and tons of others have beaten it to death. But good things came out of it, too; William Faulkner wrote about that, and so did James Dickey in Deliverance which is mentioned in the text. Everything depends on the talespinner, and here we've got one of the best - if not the best. Big Driver has a simple plot; Tess is an author of popular mysteries who is coming back from one of her author speeches and has just taken a road less traveled. She pops a flat tyre; luckily there's this enormous hillbilly just passing by who offers to help her. BANG! Come on, you saw that coming. Tess finds herself in grave danger, she's raped, basically torn apart, and left for dead. She escapes from the creepy abandoned store from the woods and tries to stay alive. This is a story of a woman who finds in herself an extraordinary capacity, want, need for justice, no matter in what manner will it be delivered. When she thinks about fate that sent the hilbilly her way, she discovers a terrifying, outrageous truth which will shatter what she has always taken for granted. While not as dark and twisted as the confession of Wilfred James, Big Driver does pack a very satyfying punch. Oh yes, a punch well deserved, aimed and delivered with a precision of someone who has been greatly hurt...and whose need for retribution is even greater. Fair Extension Fair extension, fair price. It sounded good, and almost made sense. This is the shortest, and I dare to say the blandest story from this little bag of worms. The setup is similar to that of Needful Things - a man meets another man who offers him an extension...of life. Dave Streeter suffers from lung cancer; the weather doesn't look very good for old Dave, and I guess i'm safe when I'll say the old chap should get ready to kick it one last time. But the problem is, he's not that old; he's got a good wife and children, and the same best friend since childhood. He hates him. The only thing Dave hates more than cancer is Tom Goodhugh, a prosperous man who's infinitely more succesful than Dave in every department. Dave has done everything for Tom, and later all Tom did was steal Dave's girlfriend and started a succesful, though dirty waste disposal business. No one would call Tom old Tom; he's living the dream while Dave, ready or not, starst becoming the memory. So when Dave meets George Elvid (Get it? It's an ANAGRAM! Look it up!) and the old man offers to take his misfortunes and transfer them to a person of his choosing, even granting him 15 or 20 years of life, he agrees. And the problem is ,that's pretty much it. It's all well-written and the conclusion is more than fitting, but it lacks the surprises and mood of the two pieces before it. Nevertheless it's a good story, with an even better moral. A Good Marriage As the Stevie Winwood song said, you had to roll widdit, baby. This is the story that closes the volume, and tackles a topic that is absolutely fascinating. How good we can know the person we share our bread and bed with? When we take our clothes on the opposite sides of the bed and actually go there to catch some sleep I guess we can say that we know each other like two bald horses (that's a cool Polish proverb, though I've yet to see a bald horse). But, as this tale shows, there's always the risk of disturbing an old forgotten box, and when the contents will drop to the floor so will our confidence and trust. I really liked this one. It turned out differently that I have expected, and to be honest I can't say I'm decided on the outcome. I don't know who's the true villain in this story, and that's what makes it so terrifying. How well can you know your spouse is not it's only theme. The true theme is: how will your spouse react when he/she'll learn about the thing you most wanted to keep secret? On the whole, Full Dark, No Stars delivers what it promised: four dark tales that explore the corners covered by cobwebs and dust, where the Bad Thing lies. It's been a long time since Stephen King has written a volume so brutal and graphic with it's portrayal of ordinary people in extraordinary situations. Gruesome and unrelenting, it's not a King milestone like Different Seasons but it most definitely is satysfying reading from one of the finest and most prolific writers working today. With volumes such as this he proves, again and again, that the two are not mutually exclusive; In King's case they are a blessing he chose to share with all of us. Let's be grateful for that...with the lights on. ...more I flipping love Stephen King.

It makes me feel small, actually, because the scope of the understanding that King seems to have is amazing to me. I think I'm a well-read, intelligent person, but I just don't have the eye it takes to see the world and break it down into its base parts, like he does. These stories are fantastic. They all share a commonality, but the stories themselves are different. Each story shows the ugliest parts of their character(s), and we get to poke and prod them, peek under the hood and see what makes it ugly, if it can be or ever was untarnished. By examining the ugliness, we can see how it could have been otherwise, had this gone differently, or had that not happened, if a different choice was made or the stars aligned. I love this kind of storytelling, because it shows not only what is, but a thousand what isn'ts. It makes us think and ponder and look in the mirror and ask ourselves what we would do or should do. I don't know, and I hope that I never have to find out if it means I'm put in ANY of the situations the stories in this book depict. Story thoughts are below... be warned, potential spoilers below. --1922-- \"Rats in the corn again...\" I loved this. It's gory and as disturbing as some of King's earlier work - Pet Sematary comes to mind - but as beautifully written and heart wrenching as anything I've seen him write lately. Here we have the confession of a man who brutally and cruelly killed his wife for land... He commits a horrible crime in the name of greed and tells of the crime and his life after. He's not remorseful, yet, in the end I felt so sorry for him, and I wanted him to have a bit of peace. Everything went so horribly wrong for him, and he suffered immensely in the time following the act itself. In the end, I couldn't help but feel like he definitely didn't deserve his punishment. I like how ambiguous the story is as to the rats... (view spoiler) [Were they supernatural rats, sent by his dead wife to torment him? Or were they in his head, a manifestation of his deeply buried guilt, like his own Tell-tale Heart? (hide spoiler) ] I find it interesting how King comes back to rats time and again in his work. They show up here, they show up in The Stand (the quote above is by Mother Abigail from The Stand), they show up in other short stories. It's interesting to me how he must see them - ugly, disease ridden, mean, nasty creatures that never ever stop coming. They thrive on the dead. The end of this story is abrupt, and all the more powerful for that. --Big Driver-- One thing I will say for King is that he never ceases to amaze me. This story was surprising to me. It deals with a difficult subject matter, and one that King hasn't touched very often. For victims of rape, I can only imagine that it would be traumatizing and horrible beyond words to be violated that way. It would be life changing. But somehow King changes the way 'life changing' is defined. Tess, mid-30s writer of a cozy mystery series featuring a knitting circle, is assaulted and left for dead, and it isn't the first time her rapist has done this. Rather than going to the police, she decides to take matters into her own hands. This made me proud of her, in a way. Proud that she reclaimed some control of her life again, rather than cowering in fear and closing herself off from the world. This was a pretty brutal story, full of anxiety and anger and fear. I felt all of those things for Tess, and I wasn't sure if I wanted her to try for revenge or not. I was so afraid for her! With such a serious subject, you wouldn't think that this would have me laughing, but it did. I LOVED the way that Tess voiced everything around her and gave things their own personality. It lightened the story considerably and changed it from one that could have just been very downtrodden, and angry and bitter and ugly, to one that was still a little hopeful despite all the rest, because if she's still able to breathe life into the world around her, there's still life IN her. If that makes sense. I loved the ambiguous ending... I like it when King ends his short stories this way, and lets us follow it out to our own conclusions. --Fair Exchange-- It's funny to me how King can make me feel foolish. I mean, we meet this man, Streeter, who has an inoperable cancer whittling his life expectancy down to months, maybe, and right off the bat I wanted some miracle to happen that would allow him to recover. And then that very thing happens, and it's like watching a beautiful, sunny day morph from one minute to the next into a thunderous gray storm which spouts killer tornadoes. The ugliness inside of Streeter was so unabating, and so cruel and awful, that I read this story with a grimace. Everyone has their secrets, their jealousies and their petty anger and bitterness, but this was incredible. Inhuman. The way that he is able to stand by and watch, and ENJOY it, while so many other innocent lives are ruined is just horrible. This story reminded me a bit of Needful Things... How one person gets a thing they want at the cost of others. It takes place in Derry rather than Castle Rock, but Mr. Elvid reminded me a lot of Leland Gaunt, only with a smaller shop but a bigger scope. This story was savage. --A Good Marriage-- Darcy Anderson has been married to Bob for 27 years, and a matter of hours her decent, predictable and known life has shattered around her. She discovers a secret that her husband has been hiding for a very long time, and it changes everything she has known for over a quarter of a century. I was really surprised by this one. I expected it to go very differently than it did. I expected it to continually ratchet up the tension and fear, and in one way, it did, but it was subtle. Not at all how I expected it to be. I liked that it was different. I like that we got to see an introspective and cunning side to Darcy. Obviously throughout their marriage, her husband watched her and was almost 100% sure of how she would react if she ever learned his secret, and she was complacent in her marriage - why shouldn't she be? So when she suddenly develops this new side, it's unexpected and impressive. I really enjoyed the Darker Wife theme. Very interesting concept there, and I like how it was left kind of ambiguous and not defined any further than a passing fascination of Darcy's. It reminded me a little of Rose Madder, with the strong version of oneself tucked away and only called on when it's inescapable and there are no other options. It just goes to show that you never really do know anyone. ...more In the afterward of \"Full Dark, No Stars,\" Stephen King says that the four stories collected here go into some dark corners. And he's not kidding. Easily one of his darkest collections ever, the stories are all still vintage King, looking at ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. There are no happy endings here, but instead some fascinating, page-turning stories that will linger with you long after you're done reading. (I know I'm sure still haunted by aspects of many of them. In the afterward of \"Full Dark, No Stars,\" Stephen King says that the four stories collected here go into some dark corners. And he's not kidding. Easily one of his darkest collections ever, the stories are all still vintage King, looking at ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. There are no happy endings here, but instead some fascinating, page-turning stories that will linger with you long after you're done reading. (I know I'm sure still haunted by aspects of many of them.) One of the great things about King is that after all these years he's still willing to take chances as a writer. King has never been content to rest on his laurels and he's earned the trust of his readers over the years. He's experimented in the world of publishing and been successful at just about every venture. He's done a serial novel, collections of short stories and a couple of novella collections. His novella collections have yielded some of his most successful big-screen adaptations. But it's been a while since King delved into the novella world. With \"Full Dark, No Stars\" he delves back into it. \"1922\" -- The first entry in the collection reminds me a bit of Poe's \"The Tell Tale Heart.\" Only instead of a beating heart, it's rats seeking our their revenge on the first-person protagonist. Told as a confession, Wilfred James reflects on the worst year of his life. When his wife inherits a plot of 100 acres next to his farm and plans to sell it to a local slaughter factory, Wilfred is forced to make a difficult choice. He and his son murder his wife and bury her down on old well. But that's not the worst thing. As with all King stories, there's a supernatural element to things as Wilfred tries to come to terms with the consequences of his actions. As with many of King's best stories, there's a question as to whether or not the element is supernatural or psychological. But it's still a fascinating tragedy of a story and while you won't root for Wilfred, you understand where he's coming from and why he does what he does. A solid start to the collection. **** \"Big Driver\" -- Tess writes cozy mysteries in the \"Willow Grove Knitting Club\" series and also does a few speaking engagements each year to build her retirement fund. When she's asked to fill in at the last minute at a book club close to her house, she accepts. As she's preparing to leave, the librarian in charge offers her a short cut that will cut ten or so miles off her return trip. Tess accepts the advice and sound finds herself in the middle of a nightmare. The road she travels has boards with nails on it, causing a flat tire. A guy shows up in a truck, offering to help but instead rapes Tess and leaves her for dead. \"Big Driver\" is a revenge story but one with a dark, dark turn. Watching Tess' transformation is fascinating and seeing just how far she goes is compelling. You may not like where she goes and where she ends up, but the trip is worth taking. Reading the first few chapters of this one, I thought this could be a nice movie. But then it goes dark quickly and I wonder if it would translate well to the big screen. ***** \"Fair Extension\" -- The shortest novella in the book and one that channels the spirit of Richard Matheson. Driving home from chemo, Dave Streeter notices a sign offering a fair extension. Curious, he pulls in to find out more and soon is making a deal with the devil. He can get an extension on his life, cancer free. The cost is he has to name someone he hates whose luck will take a turn for the worse. Dave names his long-time best friend, who he helped coast through high school and who stole his high school sweetheart. Even though Dave is happily married now, he resents the success his friend has while he continues to languish. The deal done, Dave heads home to find the cancer gone. And then his friend's life starts to go down the tubes. \"Fair Extension\" channels the spirit of Matheson's \"The Box\" with the added twist of instead of bad things happening to someone you don't know, they happen to someone you do. ***** \"A Good Marriage\" -- In a book with stories on murder, rape and inflicting plagues upon your friend, you'd think it couldn't get much darker. Then you get to \"A Good Marriage\" and realize that it can. While looking for batteries for the remote, Darcy Anderson discovers a hidden adult magazine in the garage. It's not your typical Playboy or Penthouse, but instead a magazine depicting bondage and torture. Darcy is disgusted, but not so much as when she hears a thud and leads her to a hidden alcove behind the box. In it is the box for cuff links she gave her husband years before. But inside aren't cuff links but a drivers' license with another woman's name. Is her husband having an affair? Actually, it's far worse than that. Seems Bob's been keeping a pretty big secret all these years. And it's one that will shake Darcy and their marriage. A compelling idea for a story, \"A Good Marriage\" treads some dark waters. **** ...more I see why this collection is titled, \"Full Dark, No Stars.\" This is a collection of four short stories or novellas, or five if you have the bonus story 'Under the Weather.' I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't read it, but I will say these stories are dark. They make you question what you would do in these situations, or at least they made me question what I would do. The bonus story, 'Under the Weather' was my least favorite.

There was something about it, and I can't quite put my thumb on it. Maybe it fell flat to me, in which you might say, \"Then why did you give the book 5 stars?\" Well, its a bonus story, and not every version of FD, NS has it. Digressing..1922 really shows the evil people are capable of, but at the same time, you almost feel bad for Wilf for his situation. This story really put you in the year of 1922, and in Wilf's psychosis. I thought it was fantastic. Big Driver was also fantastic. I had so many questions in my head, \"What would I do if I was Tess? What if I was put into that situation?\" I don't know, and I don't want to know. But, King again, shows women are capable of overcoming and seeking revenge, and again, how evil people, in this story, a family can be. Its almost sort of empowering, the story King creates, but only for women. Fair Extension made me laugh, but also made me wonder if someone would do those things to me and my family, or if there was anyone I disliked enough to do that to. Or, should I say, if I had the balls to do a deal with basically the devil, and cause someone else so much grief. Again, King hit that same 'evil' note: How evil can one be to knowingly cause and allow bad things happen to an innocent person and his family? A Good Marriage had me questioning my own marriage...if that's even possible. It just had me wondering, \"How would I feel if I found out about my husband's secret life? Would I stay? Turn him in?\" I don't know...I really, really don't know. That's hard...One moment you're impossibly in love with someone, and before you know it, the next moment you are thrown into a whole new reality. Another jewel of a story with the same evil note. I think the one word which stands out about these stories, with the exception of Under the Weather, is evil. These stories, to me, were fraught with evil. The evil people do, are capable of, and how far people are willing to go. This was the first short story collection of King's I've read, and it didn't disappoint me. It was fantastic, gritty, and dark...just like the title says. ...more No. 42 in my King reading project.

While the last one was a horror short story collection in the vein of Graveyard Shift or Skeleton Crew, this is very much sharing properties and feel of Different Seasons; 4 longer short stories which are, while horrible, perhaps not the kind that comes to mind when talking about 'horror stories'. 1922: Can't help myself associating with Joyce Carol Oates (like I did in my update) when reading this story. Think 'Little bird of heaven' and you'll be close - if JCO wrote a bit more explicit of course. Retold by the protagonist in 1930, this is the story about what happened in 1922, when his wife inherited a large piece of land that would surely save the family farm, but announced her intention to sell it instead. Big Driver: Starts out being the most 'typical' horror of the lot, in a 'Hills have eyes'-vein. The initial assault and struggle of the main character, the mystery novelist Tess, is harrowing reading. The second part enters more into 'I spit on your grave'-territory (which I really thought would be referenced along with a few that were). But the 'obligatory' twist in this one brings on a whole new turn of the story which on the whole lifts it way above any of the aforementioned type stories. Fair Extension: Terminally ill Dave Streeter negotiates and strikes a 'Angel heart'-type deal with a colleague of Leland Gaunt's, Mr Elvid (yes, really). What sets this one apart from what you'd think it's going to be is that it never develops in the direction that you'd think. A Good Marriage: Darcy Anderson stumbles on a dirty magazine in her husbands garage. When she investigates further she finds something more unexplainable - or can what appears really be true? Another one that benefits from the fact that even when the secrets are out in the open, there's no given, and certainly no easy, resolution. Loved the ending. ...more 3 1/2 stars , about which, more later. Steve King has abandoned the supernatural in favor of something even creepier: REALITY.

One day she takes a shortcut on the way home from a speaking engagement. She meets a big bad man and winds up in a culvert, left for dead. This one will appeal to the vengeful fantasies of any woman who has ever been assaulted or abused in any way. Get your hands on a Lemon Squeezer .38 and squeeze away! Just be sure your aim is good. Fair Extension manages to be both horrid and amusing in the space of about 30 pages. Streeter is dying of cancer. He meets Elvid, a vendor who sells him an unusual product: the chance to change his life for the better, at the expense of someone else. But Streeter has to choose who that someone else will be. Who would you choose? What would you be willing to inflict on another person if it meant your life would improve spectacularly? A Good Marriage is the most satisfying piece in the book for its completeness and believability. Darcy Anderson has been married to Bob for 27 years, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything about him. He's a boring, fastidious accountant and numismatist. He's also a loving, gentle, affectionate husband and father. But he has a little, um, hobby he forgot to mention. When Darcy discovers his secret, she sees to it that he's punished in a very special way. In the process, she learns a thing or two about her own darkest fathoms. 1922 is the first story, and it's the reason I cannot give the book four stars. It's so raw and gruesome and dark that it took me an entire week to read it. It's like a pukesome reworking of Poe's Tell-Tale Heart, but instead of \"the beating of his hideous heart,\" Wilfred has enormous rats to plague him for murdering his wife. This failure of imagination is compounded by a sort of Romeo and Juliet/Bonnie and Clyde subplot involving Wilfred's son Henry. But honestly, my biggest problem with the story was that I couldn't take THERATSTHERATSTHERATSTHERATSTHERATSTHERATS!!!!! \"OH MAKE THEM STOP BITING M...\" ...more Part of the title says \"No Stars\" but damn it, I'm giving Full Dark, No Stars - 5 stars!

Inside me was the Conniving Man, but inside the Conniving Man was a Hopeful Man. That fellow died sometime between 1922 and 1930. The Conniving Man, having done his damage, disappeared. Without his schemes and ambitions, life has been a hollow place.\" From the Afterword: \"I have tried my best in Full Dark, No Stars to record what people might do, and how they might behave, under certain dire circumstances. The people in these stories are not without hope, but they acknowledge that even our fondest hopes (and our fondest wishes for our fellowmen and the society in which we live) may sometimes be vain. Often, even. But I think they also say that nobility most fully resides not in success but in trying to do the right thing...and that when we fail to do that, or willfully turn away form the challenge, hell follows.\" The collection contains four stories. I enjoyed all four, but my favorite was the opening story 1922 and my least favorite was the third story, Fair Extension. ...more Muy buen libro de relatos de King.

I had the best time reading them. The title really sets up the collection well - make no mistake, these are dark tales, in places gruesome and hard to read. All of these stories feature ordinary characters forced to make awful choices. What choices! These choices resonate with power because they don't relate to the supernatural in any way (except for the shortest \"Fair Extension\"). And this is why I love King - he'll find the horror - the real, true, white-knuckling, knee-buckling horror, in the most ordinary of places amongst the most ordinary of people. His scariest stories are often the ones you know could really happen . In the Afterword, King writes: \"I want to provoke an emotional, even visceral, reaction in my readers. Making them think as they read is not my deal...if the tale is good enough and the characters vivid enough, thinking will supplant emotion [only] when the tale has been told and the book set aside.\" If that is his goal, he succeeds brilliantly here because when in the fierce, unrelenting grip of these stories you are not thinking, but feeling - terror and repulsion mostly. It's a visceral experience all right. In places I was sucked into an almost fugue state where I forgot to breathe, because I was in the story , as if it were happening to me rather than as a third-party voyeur safely removed from the action. These stories will haunt me, as will the choices contained therein. 1922: Beware the Conniving Man!!! This story has lots of gooshy parts and if you have a rat phobia, it may just put you in the nut house. What is it with King and abandoned wells? ::shiver:: So how far would you go to get your way? To maintain your life as you know it? When is someone worth more to you dead than alive? What I love most about this story is that it shows getting what you want often comes with too heavy a price tag - it's the Monkey's Paw conundrum. Big Driver: This was my least favourite of the four, if only because of the subject matter - rape and vigilantism. It's a fairly simple, straight-forward story, with a fairly predictable ending. Where the story's strength lies is in King's exploration of rape victim psychology. How Tess feels and reacts to what happens to her is how I imagine a lot of women think and feel in that situation. I hope I never have to find out. King also seems to be playing with the tropes of the mystery genre here too, and it's a nice juxtaposition to what is essentially a horror story. Fair Extension: The shortest of the four, but wicked and horrible . It's the classic Deal with the Devil scenario, but unlike you've ever seen it. What if all the things you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy, suddenly befell them at your behest? I think the most shocking part of this story for me isn't that Dave Streeter makes the deal, but that he becomes so gleefully accepting of the fallout as the years pass and the miseries heaped upon his best friend are so unrelenting. Not once is there a twinge of guilt, nor does he even have to turn away from the carnage. What does Streeter do? Pull up a front row seat and watch it all unfold up close and personal . Who is Elvid? He seems awfully familiar, and since the story is set in Derry, and at one point his teeth are pointed shards, I'm thinking he's our favourite neighborhood clown, Pennywise. The kind of deals he's driving though, made me think of Flagg too. A Good Marriage: While Lisey's Story will remain King's final, beautiful, haunting word on marriage, this novella shares some worthy insights too, both soft and jagged. You can know someone, but can you ever really know them? Is it possible to keep a secret from the one person who knows you and loves you best? You bet. This is my favorite of the four novellas, and I think the perfect choice to end the book. It's archetypal horror - Pandora's Box and Bluebeard are mentioned in its pages and with good reason. Is it better to know, or not to know? When presented with a secret, do we snoop or let sleeping dogs lie? When we snoop, and what we find is so horrific, what is our moral duty? Legal responsibility? To our children? To our society? I don't know what I would do in Darcy Anderson's position. Even when she went poking into that box, my heart was pounding. I was truly terrified by what she was going to find, and since I was feeling and not thinking , I was totally shocked by what she did find. In the moments leading up to the revelation, I was in no position to guess. I had to keep remembering to breathe!!! ...more Ages ago I read two stories by King: \u201cChattery Teeth\u201d (which I persist in remembering as \u201cClackety Teeth,\u201d) and \u201cYou Know They Got a Hell of a Band,\u201d both from Nightmares and Dreamscapes. The stories stayed with me, but I don't recall reading anything else by King for many years, until a couple of years ago when I read The Gunslinger, whereupon I fell head over heels and went on a King-binge which included the rest of The Dark Tower series, Duma Key (the audiobook,) and the Marvel Comics series Ages ago I read two stories by King: \u201cChattery Teeth\u201d (which I persist in remembering as \u201cClackety Teeth,\u201d) and \u201cYou Know They Got a Hell of a Band,\u201d both from Nightmares and Dreamscapes.

In fact, I consumed it whole on a train trip to and from Seattle this last week. Sorry, scenery, you lose. Two of the stories: \u201c1922,\u201d and \u201cFair Extension,\u201d were so evocative, not only did I turn back immediately and read parts of them again, but as soon as I arrived home, I dug out my Poe and reread \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d and \u201cThe Monkey's Paw.\u201d These are driven stories of getting-away-with-it... depending on your perspective. \u201cFair Extension,\u201d in particular, adds a twist to the classic cosmic balance concept of \u201cif something good happens to you, something bad must happen to someone else.\u201d The deviation is chilling in its simplicity, and of all the stories in the volume, this is the one I can't stop thinking about. ...more Atrocious cover aside (even if I\u2019m dumb and missing something greatly significant about a minimalistic cover with a woman making the figure nine on it, it\u2019s still terrible), the title of Stephen King\u2019s latest book is perfect. Full Dark, No Stars, ladies and gentleman, is one bleak book. And though King is no stranger to grim subject matter, when it comes to his novella collections, I think this is the darkest one yet. There are no stars. There\u2019s little hope either. Some, but not much. One might Atrocious cover aside (even if I\u2019m dumb and missing something greatly significant about a minimalistic cover with a woman making the figure nine on it, it\u2019s still terrible), the title of Stephen King\u2019s latest book is perfect.

There are no stars. There\u2019s little hope either. Some, but not much. One might almost expect to see Richard Bachman credited here such is the impenetrable darkness on display. Those looking to King\u2019s latest hoping for the supernatural will come away disappointed. Even though there are instances in which rotting corpses shamble through the night and ghosts whisper from old wells, all of the horror in Full Dark, No Stars, is of the human variety, the supernatural relegated to mere projections from decaying minds. Ambivalent hauntings are, when the source is considered, not that ambivalent at all. And because all the terrible things are authored by human hands, this quartet of nightmares is all that much scarier. Inspired by Wisconsin Death Trip by Michael Lesy, the collection\u2019s opener \u201c1922\u2033 matches Lesy\u2019s book in its bleak, wintry tone. After murdering his troublesome wife in order to keep her from selling his farm to the greedy Farrington Company, Wilfred James soon realizes, as the repercussions of his crime slowly radiate outward, infecting everyone and everything it touches, that no bad deed goes unpunished. In the author\u2019s engaging style, we\u2019re caught right along in the current as events quickly spiral out of control. There are some particularly well-crafted scenes here, not the least of which is the murder itself, but some creepy moments later in the game are very much reminiscent of King circa Pet Semetery. Mostly, however, \u201c1922\u2033 reads like an homage to Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d. King takes tackles revenge fantasy with \u201cBig Driver\u201d, the story of modestly successful crime writer Tess, who accepts a speaking engagement at an out-of-the-way library and takes a shortcut into a nightmare. Raped and left for dead, Tess escapes but, rather than going to the police (an idea quickly rejected when she considers the media attention it will draw down upon her), she decides to seek vengeance herself. This is one of the better stories in the book, even if it\u2019s well-worn ground King\u2019s dealing with. If you\u2019ve seen the movies The Brave One (referenced in \u201cBig Driver\u201d more than once), Extremities, or any of the Dirty Harry or Death Wish movies, then you know what to expect, albeit with more attention to the emotional current that thrums through the protagonist than is usually afforded the unfortunate characters in this subgenre. King is clearly aware that he\u2019s mining well-worn territory here too, but he does it with his usual style, keeping you rooting for Tess all the way. Similarly, there is nothing staggeringly new about the concept behind \u201cFair Extension\u201d, but as always, there is something new in the way King tells it. David Streeter has aggressive cancer. He doesn\u2019t have long to live. So when he finds himself offered a 15-year extension by a roadside trader named Mr. Elvid (groan), he enthusiastically accepts, convinced, as anyone would be, that it\u2019s all a joke. This is a King story, so of course it\u2019s anything but a joke, nor is the other side of the bargain, which means that, in order for Dave to enjoy a cancer-free 15 year extension, he must pass his misfortune along to someone of his choosing. Although this setup reminded me of Richard Matheson\u2019s short story \u201cButton, Button\u201d (filmed recently\u2013and not particularly well\u2013as The Box), King, to his credit, elevates this tale above standard fare by resisting the urge to follow the usual direction of such \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d stories. Like \u201cBig Driver\u201d, the author is well-aware that this kind of thing has been done before (Elvid even references \u201cThe Devil and Daniel Webster\u201d), but nobody does it quite like King. I found myself particularly impressed with this one, though ultimately (as can really be stated about the book as a whole), \u201cFair Extension\u201d is a grim and depressing piece of work. The closing novella \u201cA Good Marriage\u201d is my favorite entry in the book. After reading the synopsis, I assumed I knew where King would take this tale of happily married housewife Darcy Anderson, who one night accidentally discovers something hidden in the garage that throws everything she knows about her beloved husband into question, and I was glad to be proved wrong. Riveting and heartbreaking, \u201cA Good Marriage\u201d poses the question, however deeply you wish to consider it: Do we ever really know each other? A similar question sums up Full Dark, No Stars, and that is: Do we ever really know ourselves? Unlike King\u2019s previous collections, there is a very strong unifying theme at play here, and that is a study of how people react when pushed, or how we handle the ugly choices we\u2019re given. In all of these stories, people find themselves forced to face sides of themselves they might never have known existed if not for the intervention of exterior forces. In \u201c1922\u2033 Wilfred James finds himself driven to murder by the threat of losing the only thing he truly knows. In \u201cBig Driver\u201d a rapist awakens the primal vengeance of an otherwise mild-mannered writer. In \u201cFair Extension\u201d a man is asked to condemn another for the chance at a new life. And in \u201cA Good Marriage\u201d an ordinarily housewife is forced to make the ultimate choice when she finds out her loving husband is not what he has pretended to be. Take away the safety and security, the gravity we take for granted and you truly see what we are behind the mask. Good people, King says, may only be good as long as they\u2019re allowed to be. There is always a high and a low road, the good and the bad. But when the line of demarcation is not clear, when the gray area is a blur, and when we stand to benefit more from taking the path that will ultimately bring horror to others but an element of peace to ourselves, what do we do? In Full Dark, No Stars, Stephen King offers four unflinchingly brutal scenarios in response to that question. It is a grim and often ugly journey of discovery, but as always when it comes to King, one worth taking, if only to see what we look like when the masks come off. ...more As usual, I've reviewed each tale as I've come to it. But suffice to say this is an excellent, at turns scary and at turns thought-provoking, collection, which more than meets expectations as well as subverting them. The novella really is a form, and a length, Stephen King excels at. 1922 One of the talents often missed (even by some of his most ardent fans) about Stephen King is his focus: his ability to take a gruesome little idea and drag it out to a terrifyingly scary extreme. It\u2019s because the As usual, I've reviewed each tale as I've come to it. But suffice to say this is an excellent, at turns scary and at turns thought-provoking, collection, which more than meets expectations as well as subverting them. The novella really is a form, and a length, Stephen King excels at. 1922 One of the talents often missed (even by some of his most ardent fans) about Stephen King is his focus: his ability to take a gruesome little idea and drag it out to a terrifyingly scary extreme. It\u2019s because the novels are so long, because they\u2019re so sprawling \u2013 and frequently have so many ideas thrown into them, some of which fail to stick \u2013 that this focus is frequently overlooked. It\u2019s why the short story, or the novella, suits him so well. In the more compressed space he\u2019s able to take a scary little idea and really work on it without distraction. The result, I well know, is capable of making a reader actually cramp with tension. Here King takes a swing of the blade at Poe\u2019s \u2018The Tell-Tale Heart\u2019. A farmer in the rural heartlands of the 1920s persuades his son to help him murder his wife, the boy\u2019s mother. It\u2019s a terrible act, much bloodier and more awful than they can possibly imagine, and the story follows meticulously the winding path of all the terrible consequences of that fateful act. \u2019The Tell-Tale Heart\u2019 is a svelte, taut piece of writing. Here King extends things out to well over one hundred pages (hey \u2013 that\u2019s short form for him!) dragging out every inch of tension and focusing on every gory splatter of horror, to create a tale which is dreadfully, but exquisitely gripping. One of King\u2019s skills that everybody notices is his way with folksiness: so we have those good old boy rhythms, camp-fire proverbs and lots and lots of homespun wisdom. It means that all the dreadfulness plays out in an atmosphere of mundane friendliness. So that even though it\u2019s not set in Maine, there is no other writer you could mistake this for and this is King at his best. Big Driver Here\u2019s a tale which gives itself a treacherous path to navigate. A young writer is ambushed, raped and left for dead. When she gets herself home, battered and bruised, she opts against the police and instead takes justice into her own hands. We\u2019ve all seen, or at least heard, versions of this story before. It\u2019s tawdry and pulpy in the worst ways. The fact that all the way through the tale exhibits self-knowledge of the tropes and clich\u00e9s of this type of tale, is no sure-fire protection against itself becoming either torture porn or rape revenge fantasy. Self-awareness can, after all, lead to making a whole different set of mistakes. There\u2019s a danger here that in \u2018Big Driver\u2019, Stephen King could end up with the kind of lurid and hackneyed tale he\u2019s desperately trying to avoid. That King succeeds \u2013 and I think he largely does succeed \u2013 is through making everything matter of fact. There\u2019s no brashness her and nothing in the way of sensationalism. From the attack onwards everything is told from a calm, almost numbed, point of view. King has always been a great writer for mixing in horror with the minutiae of the real world. Here that has the effect of making the story cling on to the real world harder, of grasping onto the boring things of life, of not getting lost in some kind of righteous excitement. This is a tale that is not going to punch the air in justified triumph. It always aims to be a story about a survivor rather than a winner. There\u2019ll be some who are disappointed in it. The vicarious thrills are really dialled down here. Of course there are people who like those vicarious thrills, who want to feel outraged or to sail their fist up through the air in vigilante solidarity. This isn\u2019t a tale for them. My view however: we have a talented writer taking on a difficult type of tale, and with great calmness, just about succeeding with it. Fair Extension Would you do a deal with a man named Mr Elvid? Even our lead character here notices the obvious anagram. Most Faust stories take exactly the same path, but this one understands that it is a Faust story and so takes delight in subverting expectations \u2013 given us a deliciously malicious and cruel little tale, sour and yet strangely sweet in taste. A Good Marriage What does a wife do when she discovers her husband, the father of her children, is a serial killer? It\u2019s a hell of a question and a fascinating set-up for a Stephen King tale. This is a question which seemed oddly topical as I read it; as this week saw a man charged with a high profile murder, while his girlfriend was charged with perverting the course of justice. I have no idea how that particular case will play out, but we can all think of examples of murder where a wife/partner has had suspicion thrown against her as \u201chow could she possibly not know?\u201d ; or has actually ended up helping her partner in his crimes. The very British Ian Brady and Myra Hindley are mentioned in this characteristically American story. This truly is a subject with a lot of possibilities. It\u2019s complete chance which leads Darcey to discover Bob\u2019s (her husband of twenty-seven years) dirty, little secret. He\u2019s been prolific over the years, leaving eleven victims out there in the world. What can Darcey do though? If she goes to the police, not only will he be destroyed, but she will be too. Who is really going to believe that she didn\u2019t know? Never suspected? And what about their children? Their lives will fall apart if they found out their beloved father was a notorious serial-killer? Their futures will be forever tarnished. So it\u2019s a hell of a dilemma for Darcey: what the hell is she going to do? Obviously the bare bones of the story look fecund and ripe for melodrama, and yet King tackles it as if melodrama is anathema to him. Restraint is the key word. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say that it\u2019s unemotional, but all emotion and any possible hysteria are dialled down. And that calmness at the centre \u2013 that restraint \u2013 just makes the whole a truly creepy, frightening and effective chiller. ...more With most of King's more recent works, I've found that they just don't have the same spark that his older novels like Pet Sematary and The Shining have. But Full Dark, No Stars is definitely an exception. Filled with all kinds of creative, frightening stories that range from horror to crime thriller, this collection features different stories for different eras, and they all capture something important and something valuable. Again Stephen King is a master at bringing together maniacal characters and fantastic storylines that transport you right into the terrorizing part of his brain. Great Short stories! I enjoy his older horror type of books more than the more recent police/detective procedural books he has been coming out with lately. Yin Yang: two complementary principles of Chinese philosophy: Yin is negative, dark, and feminine, Yang positive, bright, and masculine. Their interaction is thought to maintain the harmony of the universe and to influence everything within it. I was thinking of the principle of Yin Yang while I read Full Dark, No Stars. This is a collection of four stories, in each one Mr. King explores what happens when ordinary people are put in extraordinary, and sometimes dire, circumstances.

Arlette has plans for the land contrary to what her husband wants to do with it....bad things happen. This was my least favorite of the four stories. It was the most sci-fi of them and just a bit too creepy and out there for my tastes. Big Driver Tess, and author, is invited to speak about her books 60 miles from her home. On her way back, she runs into some debris in the road and some trouble in the form of a giant in a truck. This was my favorite of all the stories, because I could understand Tess's reaction completely. Fair Extension Harry Streeter has cancer, and he doesn't have long on this mortal coil, until he meets the devil in form of a roadside vendor. He makes a deal. You how well those deals usually end up. A Good Marriage Darcy Anderson has been married to the perfect guy for twenty plus years. She knows him completely, or so she thinks, until she quite literally stumbles upon a big secret of his. And it changes everything she ever thought she knew. ....I really liked this one. So, we all think we are good people. Good people can sometimes do bad things, yet, still be good people. Yin Yang. ...more Welcome back, Stephen King. Reading some of your later novels-- Duma Key, Cell, Under the Dome --I couldn't help but think of Henry James's description of his contemporaries' novels as \"loose, baggy monsters.\" Not that your novels of late have been populated by such monsters (which might have improved them considerably), but rather that they rambled endlessly with less than compelling plots and characters.

All four stories here feature morally ambiguous narrators who commit hideous crimes for which the reader can't fully condemn them. And just when I thought you were incapable of surprising me any more, Mr. King, you give us \"Big Driver,\" a story with not one but at least two sudden twists of plot that I, your Constant Reader, never saw coming. Plus, your \"Fair Extension\" with its take on the Faustian bargain is a wonderful throwback to the days of classic Richard Matheson and Fritz Leiber stories. Thanks for the walk in the dark, Mr. King. Nice to have your wicked guidance once again. ...more DNF @50%. This was an Audible one day sale item........I guess you get what you pay for.

Mind you, I'm definitely on the wimpier side of horror fandom, so I may have found these stories scarier than many people will, but I did find them genuinely frightening.

Mind you, I'm definitely on the wimpier side of horror fandom, so I may have found these stories scarier than many people will, but I did find them genuinely frightening. My copy includes the stories: 1922 Big Driver Fair Extension A Good Marriage As well as a bonus story, Under The Weather . For the most part, these are psychological horror stories, and a couple of them are extremely scary. 1922 recounts the confession of Wilfred Leland James of the murder of his wife. (This isn't a spoiler -- it's the second line in the story.) This story reminded me somewhat of A Simple Plan by Scott B. Smith (as did the shorter Fair Extension ), where one decision can snowball into a tragedy affecting many lives. I found this story to be heartbreaking, and not so scary that I couldn't read all of it. On the other hand, Big Driver was SO frightening I had to skim close to two thirds of the story. King pushes all of my \"terror buttons\" here, with the main character, Tess, falling all too easily into a horrifying trap. Again, there's the whole \"life changing in an instant\" thing that I find absolutely terrifying. Tess's nightmare is prolonged to an excruciating degree, but I have to commend King on the parts I was able to read -- I thought he really did a great job, not only of keeping the tension way WAY up, but also handling the situation with a degree of sensitivity I wouldn't have expected. (In the past, I've faulted King for his use of crude language -- with this collection he's kept the profanity to a minimum, and I feel it's used effectively.) He also gives the reader a pretty darn satisfying ending in this one. Fair Extension is a very interesting story that asks the question, \"What would you pay for an extension?\" I found myself asking, \"Could anyone watch the effects of their decision without remorse?\" I liked the direction King took with this story, allowing his main character to be exactly who he was, without pandering to people like me who expect everyone to do the \"right\" thing. I did find parts of this story to be extremely sad and difficult to read. It's to King's credit that I never stopped liking the main character. I found A Good Marriage to be possibly the most frightening story in this collection, and it did give me nightmares. A woman discovers that her husband of 27 years may not be the man she thought he was. This one went in a slightly different direction than I anticipated, although the basic idea is the same. There aren't any supernatural elements to this one, just an exploration of the secrets that one could find in any marriage. This is another story where King allows us a certain measure of satisfaction at the end. The final story, Under The Weather , is another look at marriage. I found this one particularly sad, and King oh so slowly spools out the information, dropping hints as to what is about to come. Again, no supernatural elements, just a look at the fears that plague many of us. ...more Stephen King's first collection of four long stories, Different Seasons, contains two of what are probably his most famous and well-loved tales - The Body and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. His second collection, Four Past Midnight, while featuring four stories which aren't that bad, simply isn't as good as the first. So here's the third: Full Dark, No Stars. And while the stories here might not be as immediately classic as those in Different Seasons, they're still superb in their own r Stephen King's first collection of four long stories, Different Seasons, contains two of what are probably his most famous and well-loved tales - The Body and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. His second collection, Four Past Midnight, while featuring four stories which aren't that bad, simply isn't as good as the first. So here's the third: Full Dark, No Stars. And while the stories here might not be as immediately classic as those in Different Seasons, they're still superb in their own right. King has always excelled at writing about `ordinary' people who are pushed into supernatural or horrifying situations. In the first and third of these stories, 1922 and Fair Extension, the characters go some way to putting themselves in these situations and this makes an interesting contrast with the other two stories, Big Driver and A Good Marriage, as the characters here are definitely pushed unwillingly into their horrific situations. It's also interesting to note the male characters are the ones who get themselves involved in murder and a very dodgy deal do so out of their own free will while the women are the ones shoved into nightmares because of the actions of men. King describes these stories as harsh, and they are, but I'm all for that. This is horror, after all, and so what if the guilty are not always punished in an obvious way (read the shortest story here and you'll see what I mean). That's part of what makes these tales horrific and part of what makes King the writer he is. The other part, of course, is his understanding of the lengths to which people will go in order to survive. He is a writer who knows there is light in the darkness, and we are lucky to have him to guide us into that darkness. And sometimes, back out again. ...more I loved this! Stephen King knows how to tell a story. All of these stories are great in creepy, gruesome Stephen King style. 1922 is about a man who makes a really bad decision and the ramifications. Big Driver is all about revenge. Fair Extension is about envy and selling your soul. A good marriage, the saying \"how well do we really know anyone\" is a good description!
