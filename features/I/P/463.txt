In retrospect, my review is fairly prophetic. I'm so glad there's more to the story. ******* <---A>Lisa See</---A>'s new book (which I've been waiting for since her website mentioned that it was coming out months ago) does what she does best - writing about the relationships of people and the ups and downs of life long relationships. Whether it's best friends/lao tong (Snow Flower and the Secret Fan), husbands and wives (the Red Princess mystery series), a teenager's relationship with her parents (Peony in Love), Lisa has a rare ability to wrench your heart with the unbelievably powerful feelings that these relationships evoke in our lives. She certainly did this in <+++>Shanghai Girls</+++> - this time with sisters who grew up in modern pre-WWII Shanghai, and who because of the war are forced to make huge changes in their lives for which they are entirely unprepared. We read this story through the eyes of <---C>Pearl</---C>,<---M> the older</---M>, smarter, less attractive sister, and how she goes through her days protecting her sister, and trying to harness the sibling rivalry that always exists between them. The tension slowly grows and grows throughout the book, until the end, where if you know Lisa See books, then you know what's coming. The reason that I gave this book three stars is because I felt that after the explosion of emotions, there was no resolution. It was too abrupt of an ending, and I felt like the characters were lost to me before it was time for them to go. I understand why Lisa ended the book where she did chronologically (it would have required some serious additional writing, and I bet the publishers wouldn't have allowed an 800 pg book) but I wish that they had. Where is my coda? I will read it again, and enjoy it from the perspective of one who knows what's coming, but I can't say that it's my favorite Lisa See novel. ...more 3.5 STARS OMG!

I can't put my finger on what I didn't love about this book, I guess it just seemed to drag a little bit for me. I have to admit that I almost threw the book when I got to the rape part of the book. I skimmed as much as I could because I don't read that kind of stuff. Not word for word at any rate. Pearl and May were having a good life being models until one day their father said he gambled all of his money away (including the girls money he was keeping for them) and that he sold them to the man he owed, Old Man Louie. They were to marry his sons, Sam and Vern. I slip down next to May. I can't believe Mama is willing to ship us to America to cure my father's and her problems. But then isn't that the kind of thing Chinese parents have done with worthless daughters for thousands of years--abandoned them, sold them, used them? Pearl and May decided not to go but then some goons were sent after them during the midst of a war going on with the Japanese. Pearl and May promised they would go and they had a really hard time getting their tickets changed. Lets just say that didn't work out. One night their father didn't return home so their mother hired a boy to take them as far as he could. Pearl, May and their mom ended up in who knows where and they were attacked. Their mom told them to stay hidden in a room but Pearl came out when she realized their mom was being raped and beaten repeatedly by the Japanese. They even unbound her feet (her feet were done in the old tradition) and stomped on them too. I couldn't really read through much of this, Pearl was raped repeatedly as well. When they were gone their mom dragged herself over to Pearl and held her and talked to her until Pearl passed out and her mom died. Later, May came out and got a wheelbarrow and carried Pearl a great distance and got them on a boat. She got Pearl to a hospital where they had to do several surgeries on Pearl and said she would never have kids. I just have one thing to say about any kind of rapist. \u2193 Pearl and May finally make it to America to be with their husbands. They had to stay where they were for some time until May had her baby. Yes, she did the deed with someone and they passed it off as Pearl's baby. Pearl named her Joy. So the book goes on to tell of their lives in America. There are so many revelations and a lot of sadness. I felt so bad for these people. So many that were involved in such atrocities. But, anyway! I have the sequel and it's about Joy. I'm hoping something wonderful happens with Joy in that book after all of the stuff she found out at the end of this book. Something good has to come out of it all. MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List ...more Lisa\u2019s See\u2019s new novel, <+++>Shanghai Girls</+++>, provides a rich experience for its readers \u2013 taking them from the splendor, highlife, glamour and poverty of 1937 Shanghai to the struggles of Chinese immigrants to survive a virtual internment on Angel Island, off the coast of San Francisco, to the almost impossible challenges of trying to build a life in Los Angeles Chinatown in the context of an America that does not want them and treats them cruelly. But despite its rich background, Shanghai Girls is ul Lisa\u2019s See\u2019s new novel, Shanghai Girls, provides a rich experience for its readers \u2013 taking them from the splendor, highlife, glamour and poverty of 1937 Shanghai to the struggles of Chinese immigrants to survive a virtual internment on Angel Island, off the coast of San Francisco, to the almost impossible challenges of trying to build a life in Los Angeles Chinatown in the context of an America that does not want them and treats them cruelly. But despite its rich background, Shanghai Girls is ultimately the story of two sisters \u2013 Pearl and May \u2013 who desperately strive to help each other survive and at the same time replay in their minds and actions old rivalries, jealousies, and hurts. The summary of the book on See\u2019s web site puts it well: \u201cThey love each other but they also know exactly where to drive the knife to hurt the other sister the most.\u201d This is most dramatically shown in the novel\u2019s climax. Pearl, speaking in first person, is the narrator, taking us from 1937 to 1957. This time period matches Parts IV and V of See\u2019s On Gold Mountain: The One-Hundred-Year Odyssey of My Chinese-American Family. The perspectives are different, however. In the memoir See is scrupulously objective in treatment family members, herself, and issues very close to her. Pearl lets us experience some of the same American experiences but from a different perspective and from the inside. Late in the novel, Pearl reflects: \u201cWe\u2019re told that men are strong and brave, but I think women know how to endure, accept defeat, and bear physical and mental agony much better than men.\u201d This is certainly true of Pearl herself. Growing up in Shanghai, the Paris of Asia, Pearl and her sister May live lives of privilege. Being a Dragon, Pearl is seen by her parents as a fiery, strong daughter who can take care of her self-absorbed Sheep sister. By the time she is 21, Pearl and May enjoy the status of being Beautiful Girls, Pearl rather insensitive to those who serve her and her wealthy family. But then Pearl\u2019s journey into suffering begins. Her father loses his money in gambling debts and the sisters are forced into arranged marriages. The Japanese attack China and Shanghai is attacked by air and the country invaded. In the process Pearl and her mother are brutalized by Japanese soldiers and her mother is killed. Having lost everything, Pearl and May are forced to flee to America to find their husbands. Surviving a grueling stay at Angel Island (the Ellis Island of the West), Pearl can only hope that her husband Sam and his family will accept her since she is bringing with her a new born daughter named Joy. Much of Shanghai Girls centers on Pearl\u2019s attempt to adjust to life as a member of the Louie family. While May seeks happiness outside the home in her new country, especially in terms of her many associations with the glitzy world of Hollywood, Pearl sees her life as unending drudgery as she is locked into a routine of cleaning and cooking, working in her father-in-law\u2019s various business enterprises, and caring for Joy. In addition, she is largely responsible for caring for Vern, May\u2019s young and critically ill husband. Although her father-in-law gradually comes to include Pearl, May, and Joy as true members of his family, Pearl grows closer to her mother-in-law, and discovers that her lower class husband is indeed an Ox in the truest sense, deeply loving and caring for his family, her new Christian and much older Chinese values are tested by the terrors of the McCarthy era of anti-communism accompanied by serious mistreatment of most Chinese people. At the end of the novel the two sisters directly confront each other at last, venting all the anger and hurt each has repressed previously. Despite being very angry at May for what Pearl feels are very good reasons, May\u2019s attacks and self-defense make her realize that she may have been mistaken in many of her core beliefs over the years. But finally it is Joy who saves Pearl. When she reaches the point where she will give up everything for Joy, Pearl truly becomes her mother\u2019s daughter -- and in the process becomes the Dragon she was meant to be. ...more I can't believe I didn't write a review on this Lisa See book.

The book evolved into a long narrative that just seemed to state dates and facts without any depth and then finally reveals what was the obvious plot point all along. Did we ever know the Uncles? Vern? The girls friends? Sam? NO, only as Pearl and May see them, not a real people. I would like to have read this story (a good one) written by a different author. And I agree with the other reviewer who stated that the abrupt ending seems to just be setting up a sequel. Think I'll pass on that if it does happen. ...more This was the third book I've read by this author and I'm still confused as to my feelings for her writing.

It was an interesting enough story: two \"modern\" sisters escape the country into arranged marriages in the United States, but it lacked the interesting older cultural nuances that I so enjoy. Plus, and please forgive me if you adore history, reading about war bores me. Thank you to everyone who has served or is serving our country. We would not have the freedoms we have now were it not for people giving their life, but reading a fictional account of any war is not something I normally enjoy. I guess I will wait until this author writes something else and decide then if I'm interested enough to read it. If you like to read about Chinese culture, skip this one and \"Peony in Love\" and go straight to Snow Flower and the Secret Fan . ...more I fell in love with Lisa See's writing a few years ago when I read Snow Flower and the Secret Fan . As such, I was really looking forward to reading Shanghai Girls when it came out. Initially though, people began saying that it did not compare.

As such, I was really looking forward to reading Shanghai Girls when it came out. Initially though, people began saying that it did not compare. So it was with trepidation that I began reading this book, afraid that I would be disappointed. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. All I can say is that Lisa See has another hit on her hands with this wonderful story of two sisters who emigrate from Shanghai to America around the time of the cultural revolution in China. From the beginning of the book in Shanghai, through their journey out of China, to their stay on Angel Island, and finally their life in Southern California, I was captivated by Pearl and her sister May. Two sisters could not be more different, but more attached than the two women in this book. As usual, See has imbued this story with a wonderful cast of characters who surround the sisters and help tell the story of the bewilderment of the Chinese population after the 1937 invasion by Japan, the assimilation of the Chinese into American society in the 1940s and 50s, and finally, the mistrust, prejudice, and panic in the US towards Chinese Americans after the rise to power in China of Mao Tse Tung. See is such a gifted storyteller, that you feel like you know the characters personally and the pages just fly by. My only complaint was that the end of the story left so many loose ends. In a way it was fitting, but at the same time there were many questions left unanswered. I was, therefore, very excited to hear that Lisa See is planning to continue the story of Pearl, May, and Joy in another book. ...more I really enjoyed this peek into Chinese culture and history.

Amid this, the second Sino-Japanese War is going on, and it takes everything they have in order to get out of Shanghai. En route to America, the girls are detained at the Angel Island immigration facility and then when WWII hits they have to face the racism and discrimination against all Asian races because Westerners mistake them for being Japanese. Pearl raises a daughter and is torn between bringing her up in the traditional Chinese way or the more modern American style. Along the way, she and May share a tight and sometimes strained bond as they share life-altering experiences. Being sisters married to a pair of brothers, they all live in the same house and family on top of family isn't always the best situation. Lisa See researched this excellently, and I learned so much; from Chinese culture in general to the issues immigrants had to deal with (it really parallels the problems Mexicans and Latinos are facing in America right now), and then tying it in with several big historical events. The end was left wide open for the sequel, Dreams of Joy , which I'm now dying for. ...more I'm going to have to admit that I stayed up 'til all hours of the night to read this book. But, that being said, I also have to say that in my opinion it's not a very good book at all.

A.'s China City; face more questions about their immigration decades later, etc. -- while also dealing with broken love affairs, sibling rivalry, rape, suicide, etc.) and also totally unbelievable. You might say that Amy Tan puts her characters through as much drama, but somehow I find Tan convincing where See is altogether not. As I was reading, I tried to put my finger on what was wrong. For one thing, See's writing just isn't strong enough to convince me of the truth of her characters' psychology. One particularly exasperating sentence appears on p. 104: \"I'm May's jie jie, and I've always thought we are as close as can be, but I've been so concerned with my own miseries -- losing Z. G., leaving home, being raped, almost dying, getting here -- that I haven't paid attention every time May has thrown up these past weeks and months.\" What person who has lived through so much torture would simply list these traumas as Pearl does here?!! Which brings me to my second (and related) point: I just can't see any Chinese woman speaking as openly as Pearl does. Her voice just doesn't feel Chinese to me, or at least not the way the voice of someone of her generation should feel, in my opinion. She reveals the most private, painful kinds of events in a way that is too open, too unguarded, too lacking in subtlety. What Chinese woman (or any woman) would speak this way? Somehow writers like Amy Tan can pull it off (Tan's language is strange, weird, and powerful enough to convey strange, weird, and powerful events), but in See's pedestrian, bland prose, this story is only soap opera and pop psychology. A far better recent book about Chinese immigrant experience is Jen Sookfong Lee's \"The End of East.\" ...more I really disliked this book and I'm extra disappoined about it because I loved Snow Flower and the Secret Fan so much! It starts out OK with the depiction of Shanghai but never did anything to make me feel a connection to the characters. Pearl is just pure, unadulterated grouch, and May is a completly selfish jerk (or is she? the last few pages make me wonder if she's fine but grouchy Pearl made me hate her!) Most of the book is just a boring list of things that happened. We worked at China City.

We did the husband-wife thing (what a super annoying term!) and Vern had melting-bone disease.(What was the deal with Vern anyway? Was he retarded, autistic, Down's Syndrome, just sickly, what?? He had no purpose at all except for the stupid model boats at the end.) The only exciting thing was when May FINALLY yelled at Pearl and told her to stop being such an in sufferable bitch! Not soon enough! I can't believe that there is a sequel because I can't imagine that people want to spend more time with these cardboard people. ...more This is the second Lisa See novel that I've read, and both times when I've finished her books I've felt vaguely duped. There's so much historical detail in here, much of it grim, that I feel like I must be reading something sweeping and important. But the character-driven parts of the plot (often about tensions and jealousies in close female relationships) remind me more of...Danielle Steel, maybe? Dare I say it? Something kind of primal and potboiler-y and not too nuanced.

These dime-store drama elements, combined with the interesting and frequently heartbreaking historical aspects, make me wonder what exactly I'm reading. See puts you through a lot with her characters in Shanghai Girls -- even after the worst of their hardships are over, they can't seem to catch a break. And then the resolution is so abrupt and unsatisfying that I wonder if she's setting up a sequel. But still, it's hard to put down, and I raced through it. We'll see what the book club thinks. ...more Lisa See brings out my finest emotions. The array of words is sown deep in my mind without the fear of being uprooted.

Although she is four years younger than me, I feel maternal towards her, trying every possible way to shelter her happiness and smile. I do not believe in love but I know for sure that I would do anything for her in a heartbeat. Pearl Long resembles my sentiments or for that matter myself .Born in the Year of the Dragon, she is strong, indomitable and vulnerable yet to find her true self. Oblivious of her parent\u2019s love, she longs for the attention that presumably is showered on her younger sibling May. May Long born in the Year of the Sheep, is coquettish, loquacious and a stark opposite of Pearl. Astonishingly it is May who assumes Pearl to be her parent\u2019s favorite. Envious of Pearl\u2019s college education she yearns for everything that Pearl desires. Irrespective of several reviews, to me \u2018Shanghai Girls\u2019 is Pearl\u2019s passage through an intricate web of chance, fortune and destiny. Pearl\u2019s account relays from 1937-1957, encompassing all aspects of a modern Chinese family dwelling in the pre Sino-Japanese war era; contemporary, yet traditionalist.Born in an elite bourgeois social standing, Pearl enjoys all the privileges of being served and pampered. She and May known for their striking features acquire the title of Beautiful Girls, posing for all modeling and artistic calendars. Insensitive to lesser mortals, Pearl envisions her life with Z.G. her coy crush with whom she would marry and reside away from her family. At the age of 21, all her dreams come crashing down as her father loses the family fortune in a gambling tryst. In order to save his family from ruins he unwillingly promises his daughters to the sons of Old Man Louie, an American-Chinese, creating a merciful situation amid all members. Thus, begins a death defying and deceitful journey that questions the love between the two sisters amid their destiny to be bonded as a family. As the narration proceeds, one witness the family going through impoverish circumstances, coerced arranged marriages, the advent of Sino-Japanese war and later a masquerade of veiled secrets and acrid relationships. It is during the Sino-Japanese war that Pearl discovers her true destiny. A brutal rape attack by the Japanese soldiers leaves her mother dead and Pearl is besieged by the prospect of normality and childless procurement. \"It is said that a Dragon born in a storm will have a particularly tempestuous fate. You always believe you are right, and this makes you do things you shouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re a Dragon, and of all the signs only a Dragon can tame the fates. Only a Dragon can wear the horns of destiny, duty, and power. Your sister is merely a Sheep. You have always been a better mother to her than I have.\" True to her Dragon persona, Pearl shields May\u2019s illicit pregnancy from her in-laws and even goes to adopt her daughter Joy, unknown to the fact that the existence of Joy will open an envelope of treachery and remorse. Every one of us has in him a continent of undiscovered character. Blessed is he who acts the Columbus to his own soul. Pearl found her fierce element that helped her to conceal her fate with May forgivingly whilst adamantly coming in her own as a devoted mother who she never knew existed. Lisa comes very close to penning a flawless novel. Alas! With a sluggish start and the open lucidity of an inexplicable plot, the book at times fails to capture the mandatory attention making one skip the repetitive description to bypass the stagnated phase. Nevertheless, it is unproblematic to overlook this criterion and discover the brilliance of Lisa See. ...more \u0388\u03bd\u03b1

Is it because it makes for a better story? You get a climax when folks find out EVERYTHING in a gush of anger and such. It' can't be healthy. I still like this book, but I need to add the fact that does old school China HAVE to be so sad? Even in the US these poor women get such a raw deal, especially Pearl. Her life sucked the most! All that stuff happens to her in Shanghai, they are practically enslaved by that old man. They work constantly, only to have to deal with racists. They don't really get to have much pleasure and enjoyment. Except for May, maybe. But she's married to a teenager with developmental delays, so it's not as if her life is a nice steaming cup of Chinese tea, but it's more like a steaming cup of endless misery broken only by acting and guilting her sister into doing what she wants her to do. Read it again, it's still good, but dammit, women why don't you TALK about these things instead of just yelling them at the end of the book? And again I wonder what these folks would have to say about me, the Wood Horse. I don't think I'm very outgoing, but I am rather free spirited. Would they be like, she's a Horse so she is like this and wants to do her thing but we must put a rein on her and teach her how to be more proper when all she wants to do is kick her hooves up in the air and run in some field winnying happily and freely while her mane flows in the wind? Dammit, I want a horse. Also, dang Old school Chinese stories are depressing. Like that movie with Gong Li, and no it wasn't To Raise the Red Lanterns, though that was frigging depressing. Why didn't they go, oh, that is it, I'm not putting up with this shit and OUST that asshole man? No, in this movie she was married to an abusive asshole, but was in love with his son and even when he was dead, could they be together and happily have sex? Of course not! AUGH! 8/25/15 So this book is still good but do Chinese people really harp on the Zodiac like this because I'm still like, what is a horse like? What does a horse want to do? Why doesn't someone buy me a Gypsy Vanner? And why is this country so damn RACIST?! It's so mean! Damn. Chinese people helped build this country. They build the railroads and shit, not to mention bringing Americanized Chinese food to this place and we all love that stuff. Also Japanese people don't look like Monkeys. Slurs are weird. ...more I'm sorry to say that I thought this book was horrible.

Ever. Going into this review I fully understand I was not raised in the Chinese culture and well, I\u2019m white. I don\u2019t understand the reactions of the characters to situations and other characters. That\u2019s why while I say this book is the most depressing book I have ever read and I actually sympathize with the character who committed suicide because this book offered little hope and out of all 300 pages or so, you saw 2 paragraphs of happiness and even that was strained. The book begins with Pearl and May, 2 sisters in Shanghai when they are roughly 18 and 21. Pearl, the oldest, is immediately identified as the lesser sister in their parents eyes having to endure demeaning ridicule and comparison to her younger, prettier, and daintier sister, May. As Pearl is telling this story in first person, you really feel how sad and embarrassed she is of herself. However, through it all, even with her parents obviously favoritism of her sister May, she takes care of her, and protects her, being her jie jie. In the first few chapters we realize their Baba (father) is a gambling man who lost everything to debtors, even his own daughters in an arranged marriage. Up until then they always thought that unlike their parents, they would be able to marry for love and choose their partner themselves. They meet with Sam and Vern, the two men they will be marrying, which is out of tradition, but they are allowed to meet once before the wedding. Sam is a quiet and handsome man, very caring and mindful, while Vern is naught but 14 and very good at it, even a little less than mature. Pearl is to marry Sam, May is to marry Vern. A little while later, 17 days, their new husbands to be are due for return from a \u201cbusiness trip\u201d from Hong Kong for the marriage ceremony to take place. They after dodging, and Pearl being in love with another man, realize they have no choice to go through with it and they do. When japan declares war on China, the city is bombed, people are dying all around them, and in defiance, they threw away the tickets that would have taken them to America to meet their husbands. When things get back, and their father either runs off from his debtors or is killed, their mother and them start trying to make their own way to America using the little money their mother stowed away from their father\u2019s gambling habit. Through rape, the death of their mother, and persistence, they finally board a ship to take them to Angel Island, the west\u2019s version of Ellis Island. They find out May is pregnant, and not by her 14 year old husband, so while in detainment before being allowed to go home to their husbands, Pearl decides to raise the baby as her own since she had actually had sex with her husband on the wedding night. If you are looking for a happy life in America, it\u2019s not here. If this sounds sad thus far, it only gets worse. It\u2019s more of May being terrible and selfish toward her sister, living in a tradition Chinese home with her in laws, her husband, her sister, and her sister\u2019s husband who is not only younger, and a very sweet boy, is ill with disease and mentally slow. The daughter that Pearl raises, Joy, is an absolute ingrate towards the end and continues to step all over her mother, and even her good natured and strong father. May is continually selfish being the almost privileged girl in life and blaming her poor sister who has done nothing but sacrificed for her. If you either understand the culture, both traditionally and the earlier to mid turn of the 20th century or are just one of those people who don\u2019t mind being surrounded in misery from first to last page, then I have never read a better book for you. Being I am not, I didn\u2019t really enjoy the book on an emotional level, but the story is well written and flows enough to keep you interested and hoping for a better ending that never comes. ...more A saga with well-developed characters and a strong sense of place, set In pre-world war II Shanghai.

I turned the page and was stunned the story stopped where it stopped. ...more Interesting from a historical perspective (China and US during WWII) but the story was too plodding for me to finish. Though the sisters had unique characterization, I couldn't feel an emotional connection to either. There's a phrase in Chinese, chi ku (eat bitterness), which Lisa See's Shanghai Girls exemplifies perfectly. From one end of the book to the other, there's nothing but hardships and heartaches. The first hardship I found is not actually in the story in the novel, but comes from the novel itself.

From one end of the book to the other, there's nothing but hardships and heartaches. The first hardship I found is not actually in the story in the novel, but comes from the novel itself. See writes in the first person through the voice of Pearl, a girl growing up in Shanghai during the volatile Sino-Japanese war. Unfortunately, Pearl seems too self-aware of other people's thoughts, motives, and the world in general. Writing in the first person voice, but with an omniscient view of the environment makes Pearl's thoughts feel artificial and awkward. Another thing I found difficult to overcome in the novel were the inconsistent choice of Chinese words. The author insists on using the Cantonese word cheongsam for the traditional dresses worn by women at that time, trying to give Pearl a continental and modern flare, yet uses the traditional and scholarly term 'wu dialect' instead of the modern 'Shanghainese.' I still think that if Pearl were a Shanghai girl, she would have said qi pao, the Mandarin word for cheongsam. If one can get over the technical problems of the novel, it's easy to get sucked into the twists and turns of the two Shanghainese girls. But be warned, the book really is like vicariously eating bitterness. There are several graphic scenes that I found difficult to read as well as parts where I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop. See does a decent job of illuminating the difficulties women and the Chinese in general faced during that time. At the end of Shanghai Girls, I literally sighed. The story has so much potential to be epic, yet falls slightly short of that because of technical difficulties I couldn't overlook. Maybe I'm just being snobbish because my hometown is Shanghai, but the novel could have been so much better. ...more I have really mixed feelings about this book, it's almost like the book is horrible and beautiful at the same time.

The book follows the sisters as they are forced to flee from their native country and find refuge in the home of their husbands, about whom they know nothing at all. First of all, this book is not for everyone. The book takes place at the outbreak of war between Japan and China and there are some brutal scenes related to the war. One particular passage left me with the chills. That said I had a hard time putting this book down. Since the book is about sisters there are all the usual emotions that accompany even the best of sister relationships including jealousy and a fierce protective kind of love. There are also some very beautiful passages as the sisters come to appreciate their own mother and learn how even sisters can have incredibly different perceptions about the same events and people. I give the book three stars because the ending left me hanging. I didn't feel like I was done learning about the characters and I wanted more resolution. ...more See has once again grabbed my attention with her detail of a time and culture I knew little about and creating characters that I come to care about.

Her writing is so easy that it is not difficult to immerse myself in her stories of a culture foreign to me. This story follows Pearl and May who we meet as privelaged and spoiled beautiful girls of glittery Shanghai. Naive and so unaware of the political turmoil of their country and the bad choices of their father they are set up in arranged marriages. We follow their struggles to leave their country, immigrate to America and enter into a land and social standing that is so foreign to them. They each struggle and learn to survive in their own way but above all they always have the bond that is sisterhood. I went back and forth as to which sister I empathized with, or even liked. My opinion changed as did theirs of each other. I was a bit saddened to learn how difficult the US made it for these people to immigrate, and what second hand citizens they became...often living in fear. It made me think more seriously about the immigration issues of today. The story dragged for me a bit about midway through but pulled me back toward the end. i am now anxious to read \"rest of the story\" in her next book. 3.5 stars ...more \u0645\u0646

But about 3/4 through the book - and, as it turns out Snow Flower as well - she began to heap so many tragedies on her main characters that I sort of numbed out. I'm not sure why she does this. See creates such memorable and nuanced characters that we care about them by that point in the book and will keenly feel anything they go through. It just isn't necessary to unleash such a torrent of disaster that multiple characters die and whole worlds are upended. Are her plot choices realistic for the times and places where her characters live? Probably. But a little restraint would make her books even more palatable to me. She's a fantastic writer. She can do more with less. ...more I picked this one up per a friend's suggestion. I love works of well-crafted historical fiction and a woman in Barnes & Noble said that I might enjoy the novel if I liked Memoirs of a Geisha (one of my absolute favorites). I had never read any of Lisa See's other works. With Shanghai Girls , she clearly did her homework. There are plenty of authenticating details and the novel touches upon interesting aspects of Chinese/American history that I feel not many would know much about otherwise. Ho I picked this one up per a friend's suggestion. I love works of well-crafted historical fiction and a woman in Barnes & Noble said that I might enjoy the novel if I liked Memoirs of a Geisha (one of my absolute favorites). I had never read any of Lisa See's other works. With Shanghai Girls , she clearly did her homework. There are plenty of authenticating details and the novel touches upon interesting aspects of Chinese/American history that I feel not many would know much about otherwise. However, as a reader and a writer-in-progress, I had some rather large issues with the craft. The authenticating details that might have been used to better encompass the reader and invite them into a world that is intriguing, harsh, and--for some--exotic, become the novel's downfall. See often reveals details about the time, place, and culture in her characters' dialogue, which often felt scripted and unrealistic. Her characters often felt more like hypothetical, crafted figures than real people. As a result, I found myself feeling rather isolated and separate from the story. I felt little connection to their plights and heartbreak, of which there is an abundance throughout the novel. The novel was more of a detailed report of historical events, a series of happenings that happened to happen all to the narrator and her family. I had a professor who once remarked that a story is driven by a question: \"What are we reading to find out?\" In Shanghai Girls , the answer seems to be that we are reading to find out what happens to these girls. But that's it. It's a series of events happening to these people. How they handle what happens to them, the more poignant and thought-provoking spots in the novel, often feels neglected or swallowed up. And the characters' real motivations are often unclear. Throughout a good portion of the novel, I was driven to finish reading the novel because of my agitation rather than feelings of suspense or emotional connections to the characters. Pearl herself, even after the novel's close, remains a mystery to me. The first person narration often muddled my understanding of her character, since the connections between her hindsight reflections and her in-the-moment actions vary and jump around from the beginning to the end. Her objective, as she even says [in different words, perhaps], is to survive. But that seems to be all I know about her. She is a victim of many horrible happenings, but that's all she is as a character. A victim. While I did feel a certain degree of sympathy towards her, I was not as moved as I had hoped to be. On the cover of the book, The Washington Post writes that \"See's emotional themes are powerful...the bonds of sisterhood [and] the psychological journey of becoming an American.\" These themes are certainly present, but they are often heavy-handed and forgotten, eaten up by clumsy historical details and--again--unrealistic dialogue. These themes are most poignant and provacative in the ending of the novel. The ending, which I felt was certainly the strongest and most moving part of Shanghai Girls felt far too short and truly, unfinished. Pearl has obviously undergone a significant--and necessary--change. She's begun to stand up for herself. But her emotional journey seems to have only just begun. As a reader, I could not project what might happen to Pearl, her \"daughter\" Joy, or her sister May. Their fates are left entirely undecided. The emotional drama between the three most important characters in the story is entirely unresolved. I had far too many questions at the end to feel at all satisfied by its conclusion. It feels like it's only just begun. I always hate being so overly critical, but this one just wasn't for me. ...more I have to say that writing this review actually pains me.

I was prepared to give it three stars for it's realistic handling of the hardships and racism faced by these people, and it's focus on the experiences of women, which as we all know doesn't happen as often as it should. Characters that appeared villainous at first were given their own sympathetic traits. Lisa See clearly did her research and the experiences she was describing felt authentic. I would have been willing to overlook the inherent problems throughout the middle and even the awful, awful beginning, if not for the awful, awful end. Sadly, This book is too flawed to be forgiven. And what are those problems, you ask? 1. I Hate Everyone in this Bar I despise the three main characters- i.e. Pearl, May, and Joy. So much for a sympathetic look at the female perspective. Women are jealous!!! Women back-stab and have rivalries!!! Women complain a lot!!! Women sleep with each other's crushes!!! Women get raped!!! Women's entire sense of self-worth is centered around if they can make babies!!! Women are completely selfish and have no concern for the feelings of others!!! Are we sure a man didn't write this book? Okay, Shanghai Girls gets somewhat of a free pass in terms of the focus on marriage/children/women working at home/etc. because of the fact it's about 1930s-1950s Chinese culture. China is a more traditionalist society even today, with limited roles for women and high emphasis on family and a hierarchy within the family. This coupled with the time period makes their fixation on getting good husbands and having male children accurate. However, this does not excuse how completely infuriating they are as characters. Pearl's jealousy over her sister is understandable, but very quickly got old. She spent much of the book complaining about something or other, then being chewed out by another character/realizing she was wrong, and so moving on to complaining about something else. It's a cycle that's repeated over and over and gets frustrating. That said, she is the most likable of the three. Her rape and her trauma over it are handled well, and after the 100-page mark her complaints mostly focus on racism or their troubles as immigrants. However, most of the plot is still just things happening to her rather than her having any agency of her own. Her only goal, until the end, is to 'survive'. You gotta give me more than that. We see very little of Joy character-wise. For most of the book she's a child who doesn't get much dialogue, and is described as being the \"perfect, quiet, obedient Chinese girl\". Then towards the end she spontaneously becomes rude and insensitive beyond belief and exists only to insult her parents and spout out political nonsense she clearly doesn't really understand. ...Hell, I guess I'll give them points for accuracy to the average American teenager, but wasn't she, like, the opposite of that up to now? She's never given a scene where she behaves in a way that's sympathetic, so I don't sympathize with her. Yeah, yeah, go find your real father in Shanghai, whatever, I couldn't care less. It's not like the man you thought was your father for your entire life died yesterday. Nope, just go rushing off. I won't miss you. And now we come to May. Dear god in heaven do I hate this character. I could go on for days about how much I hate her. I could write my college thesis on it. I could fill the pages of an encyclopedia set and still have more to say. If you allowed me to write down every nasty feeling this woman fills me with in a strip of paper it would be long enough to circle the earth several times. Selfish, shallow, foolish, insensitive and blunt, inconsistently characterized, constantly playing the victim, refusing to take responsibility for anything, May is quite possibly the most terrible person to ever walk the face of the earth. It is impossible to feel sorry for her, even with her own hardships, because she makes it impossible. Everything is someone else's fault, or someone else's responsibility. Pearl's complaints never have any truth in her mind, they're just evidence of her selfishness and her not appreciating May enough when she does nothing but that. So many of the bad things that happen are the result of her doing something stupid or selfish and not telling anyone else about it. She makes me want to bash my head against the wall. So, a book that tries to provide the female perspective of immigration in America during World War II and the years after does nothing but make me wish I was reading about the male characters instead. Bravo, Lisa See. You are truly a feminist hero. 2. Show not Tell and My Kingdom for Some Character Development When I said the writing was clunky, this was primarily what I meant. Lisa See leaves nothing up to interpretation. Every last thought or opinion that the characters have is spelled out clearly, often with repeats, with increased melodrama and false emotionalism, for 300 pages. Because of this, the character development is all over the place, particularly Pearl's. Pearl is jealous of her sister. Now she learns that's wrong. Now she's jealous again. Now she's being modern. Now fifty pages later she realizes that that was stupid with no kind of transition between. Now she hates Sam. Now she likes him. Now she's traumatized over being raped. Now she's over it. Now she's traumatized again. Traits and development arise and disappear as they become convenient for the plot. Changes in personality are acknowledged as an afterthought. Characters learn the same lesson over and over, or Pearl states their weaknesses over and over. The first person narrative is part of the problem, but in general Lisa See just seems confused over what her characters are supposed to be feeling and what that means, or who's in the wrong and who's not. Which brings me to: 4. I Have a Better Relationship With the Stale Cereal I Ate This Morning Than May and Pearl Have With Each Other The plot of this book is supposed to revolve around the relationship between these two sisters. They are the focus, and every positive review I've seen describes the 'incredible bond' between them. Except... there is no bond. That's not to say that they don't do things for each other- Pearl being raped by Japanese soldiers to spare her sister, May giving up her child, both of which are incredible sacrifices. But both of these things happen early on in the story. The rest- and majority- of the book is spent in conflict, and it all ends with a screaming match. They constantly bicker and back-stab each other, fighting for control in their families and over Joy. Pearl often says things like \"me and May get along... until the next time we fight\" or \"even though she's horrible and I hate her we love each other so much, really\". Lisa See wants us to believe how close these sisters are, but from what I can see they have nothing in common and would not in any way choose each other's company if they weren't related. But Pearl continues to insist that May is her 'best friend' and they'll always stand by each other- except for when they don't. It's just stupid rivalries and pettiness, over and over and over. Wow, what a bond. 5. Lisa See Doesn't Care About Any of the Other Characters Once again, we're told things about characters and their relationships that we never get to see. We're told that Pearl and Sam love each other, but they only get a few short scenes together. We're told that everyone came to love Father Louie, but we don't see the progression of the relationships after his confession to his false citizenship. We're told that Sam and Pearl love Joy, but Joy is barely present as a character. We're told that Mama and Baba didn't love Pearl, and then later we're told that they did. May and Pearl are the only characters that are given any real attention, and the rest of the book amounts to a simple rattling off of events, tragedy after tragedy after tragedy. 6. That Damn Ending Speaking of tragedy after tragedy after tragedy, Father Louie dies, Vern is bedridden, Joy joined a commie student group, Sam hanged himself and May had Z.Q's baby years ago. That too much to take in at once? Well, too bad, because this all happens in the last 30 pages. Highly emotional and interesting events pass by in a blur, all rushing towards the blowout between May and Pearl that made me physically angry to read, and Joy deciding she's just going to rush off to Communist China to find some guy her Aunt/birth mother had sex with twenty years ago, immediately after her adoptive father died and her adoptive mother/Aunt is in a state of hysteria. That too much to take in at once? Well, too bad, that was the last five pages. The revelation of Z.Q. being Joy's father was shocking, by which I mean I saw it coming 200 pages ago and it just gave me another reason to dislike May. I was waiting for Joy to find out about her parentage for a while, but the fact that I know nothing about Joy as a character and that the book ends with Pearl simply deciding to go after her meant that there was no emotional punch to the revelation or any kind of resolution for it. It's like the entire book just exists to set up a sequel. Or that Lisa See meant to keep going and got bored. I have no goddamn idea, but I'm sure of one thing- I will not be reading the sequel. If I have to hear the phrase 'husband-wife thing' one more time I think it might kill me. ...more This book had so many twists and turns, I read it practically in one sitting. All in all, I was entertained! However, the writing style didn't seem authentic to me. Even though the book is mostly set in the early-mid 20th century, the narrator seems to speak to the reader in modern discourse, and every once in a while, a dialog is peppered with typical phrases of the times. Worse than that, is how forced all of the historical details are sewn into the story.

Worse than that, is how forced all of the historical details are sewn into the story. It was sort of like having a conversation with a name dropper. It felt that the author was desperately trying to prove how historically accurate she could be by constantly adding superfluous details, and sometimes repeating them later, just in case you didn't get it the first time around (or perhaps picked up reading months later?). I kept thinking, this woman clearly has done a lot of research on this era and/or has done a lot of interviews for the anecdotes. When I read the acknowledgements, she admits this, but really, it shouldn't have felt so obvious at the time. It was very distracting! With that said, I DID like that she shared so many details, however, the way it was done was poor. I do have another of her books and will read it, but I am weary that it may be done in the same way. ...more", "Title": "Shanghai Girls"},
