Yes, that guy. Not only was his absence noticed, but his persona would have been PERFECT for the tale. A big, smelly, hairy miss in my opinion. ** As a complete non-sequitur, I came across this gorgeously gory Hulk/Wolverine shot while I was image shopping for this review and could not pass up sharing\u2026 I don\u2019t know where that image came from, but that is a memory. Consider it a bonus and small token of my appreciation for your willingness to read my drivel. . . . Okay, now we can continue with the flattering fanboy filling portion of this review sandwich before I have to end with a final slice of gripe. PLOT SUMMARY : It\u2019s the final months of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s reign in England The year is\u2026 duh \u2026. <---A>Neil Gaiman</---A> uses this famous historical period as the canvas to create an alternative history that includes most of Marvel\u2019s major players (<---B> *ahem* except Wolverine *ahem* </---B>) and a number of well placed minor ones. They included Toad for crying out loud...and yet no Wolvie. Stunning!! Conspiracies are afoot involving rival factions and complicated politics and the search for a powerful relic (rumored to be magic) that is guarded by the remnants of the Knights Templar. Gaiman skillfully unveils and discourses on the necessary back story without losing any plot momentum. One competing group is led by James of Scotland, whose hatred and prejudice against the \u201cwitchbreed\u201d (aka mutants) becomes a central point of tension. Meanwhile,<---M> from his technologically advanced nation of Latveria</---M>, the powerful and mysterious Otto von Doom is moving various pieces around the board...and permanently removing others. Who will obtain the relic and assume control of the ultimate power in this Game of Thrones... Well don\u2019t look at me\u2026read it for yourself. Ably assisting the Queen are the duo of Sir Nicholas Fury, the Queen\u2019s Intelligencer: and Dr. Stephen Strange, the Queen\u2019s Physician. Both characters are well drawn and it was nice to see them play such a major role in the tale... ...if only Wolverine could have joined them. One of the interesting accessories that Gaiman uses to dress his story is the incorporation of the historical Spanish Inquisition but modified to fit the needs of the story. Led by the mysterious Grand Inquisitor, the Inquisition of 1602 is engaged, not just in religious-based slaughter, but all in a massive extermination of all witchkind, whose inhuman abilities clearly were granted by Satan in exchange for nefarious shenanigans. Of course, a certain non-walking, bald headed telepath named Xavier Javier has created a form of refuge, a school if you will, for these persecuted witchkind\u2026I think you can see where this is going. THOUGHTS : Definitely an above-average Marvel story and Gaiman does his usual stellar job of prosing. Politically, Gaiman does an excellent job of marrying history with the changes required to make the narrative work and I really like the way he transported the basic persona of the characters into their 1602 counterpart. They are recognizable, but still unique. Andy Kubert\u2019s art works extremely well with the story and I thought his medieval take on characters hit the mark almost every time. Two of my favorites were the blind balladeer (secretly Fury\u2019s top agent) Matthew Murdoch and the garrulous Beast: There are also a few characters that you will need to work at a bit to figure out and I won\u2019t spoil the fun here. Plus a few surprise appearances that are nicely incorporated. Overall, a very good story that could have been one of the best if not for my final gripe. I was seriously disappointed with the tie-in to the Marvel Universe. It\u2019s not that it wasn\u2019t well done or interesting in its own right, it was. However, I would have much preferred if the book would have remained an alternative history \u201cwhat if\u201d as opposed to a \u201clet\u2019s tie this in to the continuum.\" I don\u2019t want to give the specifics away but I was left thinking of this as more or less a typical Marvel story-line. I still enjoyed it and the quality is there, but I can\u2019t deny that I was bummed by how the story played out. It could have been so much more. Oh well\u2026 4.0 stars. Highly Recommended (despite my gripes). ...more This was fairly underwhelming overall, but DAT TWIST THO Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths Reviews .

I guess. Now, just to be clear, I\u2019m not a Neil Gaiman fan. Yes, I tried Sandman years ago when he was penning that comic, but I never got sucked into it. It was a good, solid series, just never more than that to me. And, honestly, Marvel 1602 felt the same way: a nice little gimmick on a standard Marvel superhero tale. There wasn\u2019t any new ideas presented, no amazing storylines, or surprise characters at all. Gaiman merely switched the setting to Elizabethan England and early colonial America, changed the names and looks of the characters, but other than that nothing else was much different. Wait a minute, I take that back: Gaiman did add a couple narrative themes that were \u201cnew.\u201d One, we have an iconic character saying that the United States is a totalitarian government going to hell. (Obviously, this was written during the Bush presidency.) Two, in a single sentence, a character basically admits he is homosexual. (Not very startling or shocking now. Maybe it was then.) Really, there just wasn\u2019t anything earth shattering in this collection. It was fairly straightforward and meh to me. But I did mention that everyone has a cool Elizabethan name and costume, right? Oh, I already mentioned that. Huh, I got nothing else. Anyway, I know all this sounds like I\u2019m bashing on this comic collection, but I\u2019m not. It was a decent read. The problem really was that I was expecting something different, something amazing, because all the hype led me to believe that is what Marvel 1602 was. The reality, however, was that I\u2019ve read better. ...more in elizabeth england - and across the world - mysterious and sinister events are taking place that threaten existence itself. a varied cast of heroes and villains seek to understand and perhaps even control this threat. of course, the heroes and villains in question are a gallery of classic Marvel characters, including Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Doctor Doom, and Nick Fury.

Neil Gaiman is known for his striking reinventions of classic and even mythic characters; in Marvel 1602 he turns his eye to the Marvel canon, with mixed results. the language and the plotting are quite accomplished, with all of the verve and polish and depth one comes to expect from a writer of Gaiman's calibre. the plot is rather marvelous - complicated and dense, yet with a clear internal logic and a genuinely thrilling ending. and there is a real kick in seeing characters like Nick Fury and Doctor Strange reconfigured as, respectively, Queen Elizabeth's Spymaster and Royal Physician. the only issue i have - and it is a major one - is that by using Marvel characters, Gaiman is using characters with their own internal logic. these are characters who resonate on many levels, and unfortunately their use in this story is sometimes painfully at odds with established characterization that has been literally decades in the making. Magneto is a good example of this often irritating disconnect. this character is an olympian figure, capable of much harm but with an overriding need to protect the mutant race. in this version, he still retains some of those traits, but they also come and go as Gaiman sees fit. watching Magneto plot to burn alive one of his fellow mutants was really too much to swallow. overall the art was quite lovely. especially the beautiful scratchboard covers. ...more How would the Marvel Universe look in the 17th century ?

I tako ja, pored \"Orlanda\" Vird\u017einije Vulf i teglice iranskog \u0111umbira u prahu, dobih i ovaj strip. Elem, Neil Gaiman i ja imamo neki love-hate relationship svih ovih godina. Volim ga kao autora knjiga za klince (mla\u0111e i starije) i ludo ga volim kao strip-scenaristu, dok me kao autor romana \"za odrasle\" nepopravljivo i \u017ealosno smara. Nevertheless, kad god mi se uka\u017ee prilika, ne\u0107u propustiti da mu dam \u0161ansu, budu\u0107i da je u pitanju jedan od onih old-school pripoveda\u010da koji \u010dvrsto veruje u mo\u0107 i va\u017enost pri\u010de i pri\u010danja, kao i njenog uticaja na oblikovanje sveta oko nas. Elizabetinska Engleska je jedan od omiljenih Gaimanovih istorijskih perioda, \u0161to je i pokazao u pri\u010di \"San letnje no\u0107i\", za koju je dobio grdilo presti\u017enih nagrada za fantastiku (v. Sandman 3 ). Stoga, kad je u pitanju istorijska potkovanost, kao i preplitanje stvarnih istorijskih doga\u0111aja sa ma\u0161tom, nije moglo biti ve\u0107eg zicera od Gaimana. Postavilo se samo pitanje opravdanosti sme\u0161tanja Marvelovih junaka u 1602-gu godinu. Da li nam je to zaista potrebno? Mislim, zaaaistaa ? Za\u0161to to raditi? Odgovor je krajnje jasan: a \u0161to da ne? Anyway, nikad nisam bila naro\u010dit poznavalac, samim tim ni fan Marvelovih junaka, te sam ponesena cunamijem (malo je re\u0107i talasom) filmova iz njihove (hiper)produkcije donekle postala upoznata sa tim ko tu koga \u010dime i za\u0161to. \u010citaju\u0107i sagu \"Infinity Gauntlet\" samo me zabolela glava - previ\u0161e svega . Me\u0111utim, i pored skepti\u010dno podignute obrve, zaronila sam u \u010ditanje nemaju\u0107i \u0161ta da izgubim, naprosto o\u010dekuju\u0107i kostimiranu zabavu sa previ\u0161e svega . But soft! Iako je u stripu zaista mnogo likova, pri\u010da ni u jednom trenutku ne prestaje da funkcioni\u0161e i zabavlja! Prona\u0161av\u0161i svakom od likova iz Marvelovog univerzuma odgovaraju\u0107e mesto u godini 1602-goj, Gaiman je postavio odli\u010dan okvir za istorijsku pri\u010du u kojoj se smenjuju vladavina kraljice Elizabete i kralja D\u017eejmsa, surovost Inkvizicije, nezadr\u017eiv napredak otkrivanja tajni prirode i nauke nasuprot uvre\u017eenom sujeverju i strahu od nepoznatog, u to ve\u0161to upli\u0107u\u0107i stvarni istorijski doga\u0111aj (borba za opstanak engleske kolonije Roanoke u Novom Svetu i poseta prvoro\u0111enog koloniste na novom tlu, devoj\u010dice Vird\u017einije Der, kraljici Elizabeti) u misti\u010dnu avanturu sa iznena\u0111uju\u0107im plot twistom na kraju. I tako, sve ono \u0161to mi kod Gaimanovih romana \u0161kripi - obrt negde pred \u010detvrtinu zavr\u0161etka pri\u010de, rasplet koji se obi\u010dno zgura na poslednjih 3 posto - u ovom stripu funkcionisalo mi je besprekorno, u kombinaciji sa apsolutno prelepim crte\u017eom Andyja Kuberta i koloriste Richarda Isanove, koji su savr\u0161eno sproveli Gaimanovu zamisao u delo. Presuda: kad bih morala da opi\u0161em ovaj strip sa svega tri re\u010di, one bi glasile: So. Much. FUN! A ako meni ne verujete, evo \u0161ta je Gaiman u pogovoru stripu svojeru\u010dno napisao: I just re-read \"1602\", for proofreading purposes, this afternoon, in a small boat, drifting across a lake on a sunny day, and I found, to my relief, it was very much the kind of comic I had wanted to write: something for summer, to be read under a porch or in a treehouse; or up on a roof; or in a small field, a long time ago, beside the bulrush patch. Tako da znate \u0161ta mo\u017eete da o\u010dekujete. :) ...more Time travel! Apocalypse! Which Marvel book am I talking about? While these themes are old hat for a Marvel comic, Gaiman does a very good job writing this otherworld story called 1602. So it makes old themes interesting. But they're still old themes.

And the stories are what usually bore me in Marvel comics. While DC has its share of time travel and apocalypse-themed stories, it seems like every single Marvel comic is about this shit. So be forewarned, while the story is very different and unique, it's themes are not. However, it's the details, the individual lives of the characters that make this come alive. As you may have guessed, I'm not a Marvel fan in this universe. In this universe I'm a DC fan. There's no way around it, it's science. So I have a lukewarm interest in Marvel. But Gaiman, in the context of very early 17th century England under the ruling Queen Elizabeth I, writes fascinating versions of these characters that I was excited to read about. Andy Kubert illustrates. I don't know if his style is adapted to the story set 400 years ago, rough and dark and scratchy, antique, almost to imitate artwork found in Elizabethan literature. I don't know if he was limited by Gaiman's direction of numerous tiny panels and rare splash pages, muted colors, and thin lines. But I didn't enjoy looking at these pictures. Some were okay, some had great detail and showed incredible humanity and uniqueness in characters. But most were busy, dark and fuzzy, few drew me in or gained my admiration. Which is funny, because I feel like comics like this present a rare opportunity to immortalize and stylize a time which is hardly written about in comics, let alone superhero comics. Time and the Batman, for instance, has some incredible artwork when Batman appears in prehistory and early America. So the themes are old, characterization is great, the artwork is okay, but let me tell you, this thing is prosaic. For only being 248 pages it took me some time to read, because Gaiman writes wordy and maximum exposition here. Seriously, like paragraphs on each page. In his defense there's a lot of story, and maybe the book should have been stretched out another two hundred pages. It feels like an epic 400 page book. But it's very wordy, much like the 80s X-Men comics I've had trouble reading for the same reason. It's not a deal breaker, it's a deep story, I just wish it was a little cleaner exposition-wise. And what does all this add up to? It was pretty cool. I liked the story and characters. The historical context was really cool. I didn't love it, I won't buy it, but I'm not the target audience. I'm lukewarm on Gaiman and Marvel. So considering that, I think fans of Gaiman or Marvel would probably really enjoy this. ...more Sudden strange disturbances in weather have provoked panic all over Europe.

Neil Gaiman asks the question \u2013 what if the Marvel universe began 400 years earlier? He tries his best to give you an answer. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t quite care for this. The whole story felt overly gimmicky rather than creative and original. Switching up the names certainly made sense based on the era in which Gaiman was setting the story but I found them hokey and distracting. Charles Xavier as Carlos Javier? Peter Parker as Peter Parquagh? Meh. Daredevil was another lost cause. While he had a pretty strong presence in the story, he came across as annoying. I\u2019ll give Gaiman some points for taking a unique approach to the Marvel universe but I just couldn\u2019t get behind this. I can usually breeze through trades in a night, two nights tops but this here collection took me much, much longer. I felt myself constantly drifting, struggling to pay attention. The writing would often grab me if I stumbled across a memorable scene or exchange between two characters but it was few and far between. I don\u2019t think this was really for me.

When I read Gaiman I sometimes experience a little bit of disappointment, but since this is the first graphic novel of his that I read, I think that this is also his forte and I really want to find Sandman now. It was absolutely amazing to follow the characters, see how their identities are revealed, most of all Captain America. Though I also really disliked him, to be honest. The entire book was very interesting, witty and full of twists and turns and little surprises and entirely too pleasing for a fan of the abovementioned superheroes. I'm also not disappointed I found Marvel 1602 so late, because if I hadn't developed such love for these characters, I might not have appreciated it as much. The drawings were also great but what I enjoyed the most out of them were <---C>Scott</---C> McKowen's covers , which are absolutely amazing and I loved reading the afterword about his techniques.

Why I loved it: Neil Gaiman, really inventive premise, beautiful artwork, and a lot of fun matching up the Elizabethan superheroes to their modern day counterparts. This is what a good comic book should be--draws you in and won't leave you alone until you've finished it, all the while reading with a ridiculously big, childlike smile on your face. Loved it. Gaiman's take on Marvel super heroes focuses on Britain in 1602 as a friendly Queen Elizabeth is likely to die soon and news comes of something worse than eradicating super heroes . . . the end of the world. Some really interesting idea combos. It helps if you know the Marvel world already to get some of the references.

Apparently 15 years prior a rift in space deposited a traveler to that universe. This is causing terrible ripple effects. Dr. Strange, who plays the part of Dr. Dee of Elizabethan fame, realizes that this events, if left unchecked, will cause the destruction of this universe. What follows is a tale that has very common elements- from the plight of the Witchbreed at the hands of the Inquisition to the political upheaval of the coming of James to be crowned as King of England. But there are cosmic elements as well- from the subtle hints about the Phoenix Force to the Watcher's plans. That is all I am willing to say about this plot. The best part is the vision of Mr. Gaiman who transforms the \"ordinary\" superheroes we all know and transforms them into very creditable and realistic 1600's versions. The broad base of knowledge and his meticulous research shows in the dialogue and historical tidbits scattered throughout this tale. This was a pleasure to read. While many comic book writers are quite talented, there is a certain graceful lyrical quality to Gaiman's prose and descriptions. His wonderful versions of common heroes and villains works extremely well- from the Irish man Murdoch to von Doom. A truly original and fresh perspective on telling a marvel tale. The artwork was good, though not amazing. For the story being told and the time period- the artwork complements the story. Were I to quantify my liking of it (it's hard to quantify art itself, I can only quantify my enjoyment of it) I'd give it a 4/5. It works well in the context of the story and never hinders it. But this is a tale you read for the story. Wonderful characters, unique settings, detailed historical research of customs and colloquialisms and a truly fresh take on the oft done \"time travel/universe-is ending\" marvel tale. Highly recommend to any Marvel fan, comic fan and Mr. Gaiman fan. ...more In recent years, I haven\u2019t followed so many comics, with all of these reboots, alternative histories and cycles.

Are laser beams cool if no one witnesses their awesome powers of destruction? Do cows share our appreciation for the kick-assedness of a finely cut leather jacket? Gaiman's Marvel 1602 reimagines the Marvel universe as it might have been had it been born not in mid-twentieth century America, but instead at the dawn of the seventeenth century in Elizabethan England. The X-Men, the Brotherhood, they all appear, and part of the fun comes from that uncanny moment of recognition when you spot an old friend or villain dressed in strange but familiar garb, living their lives in strange but somehow fitting ways. Matthew Murdoch is a blind bard singing songs of the four lost heroes that sailed the ship Fantastik. Sir Nicholas Fury runs Elizabeth's spy network. A bald, crippled man by the name of Carlos Javier is gathering a group of super-powered individuals, named \u2018witchbreed\u2019 by the Inquisition among others, together at a secret school. All in all, there\u2019s twenty some characters here, and Gaiman attempts to juggle page space for each of them at the same time he tries to weave together a plot that includes another of Doom\u2019s attempts at world domination, the combined efforts of King James and the Inquisition to wipe out the witchbreed, plus a rip in space and time that might very well end the existence of every universe, ever. It may sound all a bit too cute, and maybe if Gaiman were a lesser writer, that\u2019s all this would have been. But he\u2019s not a lesser writer, he is in fact a very awesome writer, and by inserting these characters, so long stuck in one place and time or role, into a completely new universe, as a group just learning of their powers and how to interact with the world, Gaiman resurrects a bit of the fun I\u2019m sure readers had in the 60s reading and watching as Lee, Ditko, and Kirby brought these icons to life the first time around. What could have just been another meaningless exploitative stunt (dear god, they've killed Superman), becomes instead an entertaining, sometimes touching, not altogether unrealistic, or even uncanonical (by Marvel standards), exploitative stunt. It is to put it simply, very, very, cool. ...more Nie jestem fank\u0105 Marvela - to ma\u0142o powiedziane.

They must save the world (natch) despite the Inquisition, political intrigues, and supervillains. The suppositions \"Church = bad, Queen Elizabeth = good and enlightened\" kind of annoyed me with their lame ahistoricism (suuuure Eliz I was against torture)but overall the setting was well done and interesting.

Now for a moment let us assume that we transplant our Marvel heroes to this time and place, what events would transpire ? Neil Gaiman attempts to answer this question in his own way. And he does this by overhauling the characters and planting them firmly in 16th century England. The thing with superpowers is that while it might be difficult to be a hero in front of everyone, no one said anything about doing this in private (and totally in hush hush !). The Britain of Marvel 1602 is one where the Queen is assisted by her master of spies Sir Nicholas Fury and her court physician Dr. Stephen Strange in administering and ruling over the land. The cast features almost all fan favorites \u2013 X-Men & Magneto, Daredevil, F4, Spidey, The Hulk, Thor and Captain America in totally unique avatars. What struck me as most attractive were the origin stories that Gaiman created for the characters. They were still the characters I knew but were shorn of their spandex costumes and American attitudes. While this paves the way for amusing storytelling it also has an impediment that there isn\u2019t much of experimentation that Gaiman can do with them. Which means to say there is only so much that you can stretch the character of a Dr. Doom or a Charles Xavier. Even while playing within such restrictions, the story does offer some surprises in terms of character development and growth (My favorites were the transformation of Peter Parquah and Bruce Banner towards the end). The prose flows with a steadiness that is characteristic of Gaiman and it is more in the lines of a fairy-tale set in an alternate London. The art by Andy Kubert is excellent and deserves all the praise it receives . Finally a superhero team up where they don\u2019t go to battle against silly aliens (brushes away tears). Highly recommended ! ...more I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.

This story, though, was engaging on many levels, and I'm thankful that my brother loaned it to me. The premise is that we are in the regular Marvel Universe, but certain Marvel characters are appearing about 360 years too early, and the players (mostly Nick Fury and Dr. Strange, adapted into Queen Elizabeth's spymaster and physician, respectively) have to solve the problem before The End of the World. Which is not a premise that draws me in, frankly, but Gaiman and Kubert really make it work. The story involves a web of subplots similar to epic fantasy stories like A Game of Thrones, as multiple characters undertake missions with complicated motivations, usually with shocking disasters and betrayals along the way. Other alternate universe stories can get bogged down with too many cameo appearances, but Gaiman makes wise character choices to make the most use of who he selects. He also steadily ratchets up the sense of danger so that the stakes really feel high by the last pages of the book, avoiding another common alternate reality problem. And I love the way Gaiman brings up the religious implications of Marvel's characters - in the contemporary Marvel Universe, people aren't theologically challenged by the existence of Greek gods alongside Norse gods alongside members of monotheistic religions, but with the role of the Church in 17th-century Europe, characters are repeatedly confronted with challenges to their worldviews, and it really works. This story isn't a must-read, especially for anyone new to comics. Technically, a new reader could finish this story, but it won't have nearly the same weight to someone unfamiliar with the classic 1960s Marvel characters. Still, for a moderate Marvel fan interested in a moody and cerebral take on some beloved characters by creators with a clear storytelling vision, this is completely worth a read on a rainy afternoon. ...more Marvel 1602 by Neil Gaiman is unique and groundbreaking for a Marvel comic series.

British comics, on the other hand, often tend to lean more towards addressing alternate pasts - something I found more enjoyable, since it's grounded in something (history) rather than being an imaginitive free-for-all (hence, the camp of the 1960s, which American comics are still recovering from).

While Alan Moore is genius when it comes to this sort of thing ( V for Vendetta , A League of Extraordinary Gentleman), Neil Gaiman's work is both immediately accessible (since it isn't bogged down with too many allusions) and ultimately less satisfying. But Marvel 1602 is a solid work; it seems to get less cheesy in many ways as one reads on, as the immediate premise (20th Century superheroes in early 17th Century Britain) becomes submerged in a pretty good story. The art could've been better; having it be more stylized or reflective of art of the period might have been a nice touch (or at least a little more like the covers, which are pretty decent); instead, the art ends of being a little too typically cartoony at times, particularly with the digital coloring. But like I said, it's a solid work, and pretty darn enjoyable. ...more Abart\u0131s\u0131z s\u00f6yl\u00fcyorum \u015fu ana kadar okudu\u011fum en iyi \u00e7izgi roman .\u00d6ncelikle konu kesinlikle m\u00fcthi\u015fti , #neilgaiman anlayaca\u011f\u0131n\u0131z yine d\u00f6kt\u00fcrm\u00fc\u015f .\u0130lk ba\u015fta \u00e7izimler silik gibi gelsede anlad\u0131m ki 17.
