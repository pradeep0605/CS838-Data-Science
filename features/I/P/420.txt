Don Tillman is an Associate Professor of genetics at the University of Melbourne. He has a black-belt in Akikido, and can cook a mean lobster salad. He also has Asperger syndrome \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t know that. Don just thinks that there\u2019s something missing that leaves him baffled by human behaviour and unappealing to other people (especially the opposite sex). But after his dear old neighbour tells him that he would make someone a good husband, Don decides to get married \u2013 and to limit the fallout of incompatibility and highly ineffective dating detection, Don decides to make a questionnaire to find himself the perfect wife.<---F> Thus, \u2018The Wife Project\u2019</---F>. This is not insane. It has actually happened , to Amy Webb from Baltimore who found her husband by using math and analytics to narrow the dating field. 2. Rosie Jarman is not a potential partner for Don\u2019s Wife Project. She\u2019s a barmaid who is perpetually late and vegetarian. But she is also beautiful and smart. And she\u2019s on her own quest to find someone \u2013 her biological father. Rosie has bright red hair, dresses to impress no one but herself and calls em\u2019 like she sees em\u2019. But she is not a \u2018Manic Pixie Dream Girl\u2019 . She does not want to \u2018fix\u2019 Don, she\u2019s tough and imperfect and very aware of her failings. She is one of the best romantic-comedy heroines I've ever read. 3. This scene of Don speed-dating (which I read while on the train, and attracted many curious looks as I snorted my way through it); \u2018I've sequenced the questions for maximum speed of elimination,\u2019 I explained. \u2018I believe I can eliminate most women in less than forty seconds. Then you can choose the topic of discussion for the remaining time.\u2019 \u2018But then it won\u2019t matter,\u2019 said Frances. \u2018I\u2019ll have been eliminated.\u2019 \u2018Only as a potential partner. We may still be able to have an interesting discussion.\u2019 \u2018But I\u2019ll have been eliminated.\u2019 I nodded. \u2018Do you smoke?\u2019 \u2018Occasionally,\u2019 she said. I put the questionnaire away. \u2018Excellent.\u2019 I was pleased that my question sequencing was working so well. We could have wasted time talking about ice-cream flavours and make-up only to find that she smoked. Needless to say, smoking was not negotiable. \u2018No more questions. What would you like to discuss?\u2019 4. Don Tillman is described as being a dead-ringer for Gregory Peck, circa Atticus Finch. *le sigh* 5. \u2018The Rosie Project\u2019 started as a screenplay . Graeme Simsion then decided to turn it into a novel \u2013 but still used film-writing techniques and his writing partners were film-industry experts. This is why \u2018The Rosie Project\u2019 is destined for the big-screen. The dialogue is so tight and pitch-perfect, the lines just leap up at you and it\u2019s as though characters are speaking from the page. I want to see this film adapted \u2013 move over Harry & Sally, it\u2019s all about Don & Rosie! 6. At one point, Don and Rosie travel to New York where,<---M> Don says</---M>, \u201cbeing weird is acceptable.\u201d I am going to New York this year. I\u2019m planning an entire day at the Natural History Museum, thanks to Don. I can\u2019t wait! 7. The cover is in-your-face-magnificence. It called to me from the bookshelf, and loudly announced itself to fellow commuters as I read it on the train. I liked this. Very much. 8. Throughout the novel Don starts to question if it\u2019s him that\u2019s missing some vital human-connection component, or if maybe other people are the problem . . . this is encapsulated in the relationship Don has with his best friend and fellow teacher, Gene. Gene is fifty-six and happily married to a beautiful woman with whom he has two children. But Gene\u2019s wife, Claudia, has agreed to an open-marriage and Gene is currently attempting to sleep with a woman from every country. Gene dispenses romantic advice to Don. This is not a good idea, and was a fantastic counter-point to Rosie and Don\u2019s romantic shenanigans. 9. I would actually love a follow-up to \u2018The Rosie Project\u2019 because when I got to the last page I immediately missed Don Tillman and wanted him back! But whatever Graeme Simsion decides to write next, I\u2019ll be reading because he\u2019s now an automatic-buy author for me. 10. I could keep going and going and going because I adored \u2018The Rosie Project\u2019, but let\u2019s agree that \u201810\u2019 is a good place to stop espousing on all the reasons everyone should read this book. ...more Sheldon in love. Adorable and fun. Probably one of the most enjoyable chick lit books I've read, ironically, written by a man. On the other hand, not nearly enough sex in it. This does for Autism what Pretty Woman did for prostitutes. It uses it for entertainment, it plays on it for laughter. It's a 1970's sitcom of a book. The character of (Shel)Don feels like little more that fan-fiction of The Big Bang Theory and Rosie seems like the perfect emulation of The Cool Girl as described in Gone Girl. She's too trite and quirky to be believable. Don himself is simply a figure of fun, he moves form scene to scene for our amusement in a \"what will he do now?\" manner as Juli This does for Autism what Pretty Woman did for prostitutes.

Don himself is simply a figure of fun, he moves form scene to scene for our amusement in a \"what will he do now?\" manner as Julia Roberts did in Pretty Woman. The book groans plot wise, nothing is surprising and though it is an easy read it is an utterly underwhelming one. I spent most of the book thinking of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Fault in our Stars or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, books with exceptional narrators that show rather than tell. At every stage Don tells. He is created simply to amuse. I guess this is meant to be an entertaining book but given the subject matter it should have been more than a collection of \"smirk at the autistic dude, it's ok cause the author had him say we could\" sequences. http://atheistdad74.blogspot.com.au/ http://www.wattpad.com/story/18231712... ...more What a shame!

The premise that hi What a shame! What a shame Graeme Simsion wrote this offering \"quickly\" and that he went with a \"comedy rather than a drama\". What a shame that the opportunity to educate and illuminate was squandered and traded for gratuitous laughs ,extreme generalisations and blatant stereotyping. My initial delight at realising the subject matter of this book meant I was immediately enrolled in ' the project'. A third of the way into the book, I became uncomfortable with the tenor and theme. The premise that higher functioning individuals on the Autistic Spectrum , or anyone for that matter who sits outside societies 'normal' framework accepts their position matter-of-factly is absurd. Don knows he is 'weird' , inappropriate and that people make fun of him and the author suggests that Don is OK with it. So accepting of ridicule is he that he purposefully resorts to self-promotion as the class clown and nutty professor as a means of gaining some form of acceptance or acknowledgment. Don tells us that he is \"an expert at being laughed at\" , but Simsion never let him tell us how he felt about being so. Instead the author invites us to laugh along with an inexhaustable number of accounts of 'crazy' behaviours , thoughts and incidents throughout this 'comedy'. I waited and hoped for for the opportunity to feel Don's pain; but unfortunately his distress, sadness, vulnerability and loneliness if touched on were labels without feeling, what we regular people experience, but Asperger individuals ( according to Simsion) only know if they score highly on a questionnaire! The idea that the Don's of this world do not feel the aguish associated with isolation and rejection is no less inaccurate than they are incapable of feeling empathy or knowing how to show love. In the 1997 movie \"as Good As It Gets \" ( mentioned in The Rosie Project), screenwriter Mark Andrus ensures that whilst revealing the prescriptive anxiety-provoking world of Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder , he never loses sight of the anguish and humanity that underscores the day to day reality of a person who fails to conform to societal norms. He offers the audience an opportunity to empathise as well as laugh at seemingly 'weird' behaviours of the main character Unfortunately, in his 'Rosie Project' , Simsion misses the opportunity to be a champion for his protagonist, failing to show that although Don is hard-wired neurologically to behave and respond in what makes make him a target for ridicule and isolation , that his acute awareness of how he is perceived comprimises his inner struggle and peace. Even at the end, when it seems Don has found happiness and acceptance, it was dependant on his adjustment and conformity to societies sensabilities. Obviously I found some positives in this book. Well written, engaging and with plenty of local flavour being set in Melbourne , making for an enjoyable read. The insights offered about the inconsistencies of what society accepts of human behaviour depending on who you are or your position in life were welcomed. I also felt heartened that along with laughing at Don, the audience were also shown that if you move beyond the visible and audible irregularities of a person, we all have something to offer; that we all have value and strengths and all deserve respect and to be treated with dignity. I hope that maybe, some readers will also see beyond the comedy to the human side and perhaps even accept that maybe, we 'neurotypicals' all need to change a little , tolerate a little bit more and accept a different way of seeing things so that the marginalised in society can fit in a little bit more. I share my life with a 'Don' and I think 'the Rosie Project' has not done his cause any favours and does not represent him faithfully, with respect or the humanity he deserves. Again... What a shame! ...more Don Tillman is an Associate Professor of Genetics with (probably) Asperger\u2019s Syndrome who has decided that, as he is nearing 40, he will solve \u201cthe wife problem\u201d (ie. not being married) by creating a questionnaire that will ascertain, for him, the perfect wife and then marry her.

I say that Don probably has Aspergers because it\u2019s never explicitly stated but as he narrates the book in the first person, the reader is immediately aware that he sees the world differently than the rest of us. It\u2019s kind of like having Sheldon Cooper from \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d talking to you - Don is a genius with no social skills who\u2019s unable to read facial expressions and has a highly regimented lifestyle and peculiar way of speaking. Couple that with the opening scene where he gives a talk on Aspergers and it\u2019s highly suggested that he has it. Not knowing anyone with Aspergers, I can\u2019t tell whether he sounds convincingly like someone with it but what little I know of the condition suggests that his personality is unlikely to change as dramatically as Don\u2019s does throughout the book. It\u2019s almost like his meeting Rosie reverses the condition. I mean, he\u2019s unable to feel love - but he can? He\u2019s unable to read facial expressions or understand social conventions - but then he can? Nevertheless I thought the first 200 pages of the book were charming. Don is a likeable guy whose eccentric lifestyle makes a change of pace to the usual rom-com formula and the different angle it gives to the genre made me interested in it even though romantic comedies aren\u2019t usually my thing. There were also some excellent scenes that stuck out memorably like Don and Rosie\u2019s first date, from using aikido on the waiters to altering time and having dinner on a whiteboard (not as surreal as it sounds but nice touches anyway), and Don and Rosie\u2019s moonlighting as cocktail waiters and Don using his remarkable memory (eidetic?) to take complex drink orders for dozens of people at a time. I read the first two-thirds of the book in a couple days, smiling a lot throughout. And then I got to the final third which took me over a week and ruined the book for me. The first 200 pages had been unique to the rom-com genre and felt highly original which is why I responded so well to it - it wasn\u2019t going over the same ground countless other stories had gone over before. The final third is all about convention and it opens with a scene in New York. The story is set in Australia but because Don and Rosie are hell bent on finding Rosie\u2019s biological father, their search takes them to two possible fathers in NY. This 50 page section felt completely contrived and could\u2019ve been cut from the book entirely. This book was originally a screenplay and these scenes felt very cinematic and included so that film backers would have recognisable locations for their film to make it easier to sell, rather than serving the story. Yes, the finding Rosie\u2019s real dad storyline is in play but if you took those two people away from NY and cut it entirely, the book would\u2019ve been snappier. As such it feels really contrived and dull, like the scene in the movie where the two romantic leads get to do a kind of montage sequence of things. It also constantly references other romantic comedy movies the entire time too, adding to the feeling that this is a homage to the genre and included because that\u2019s what\u2019s expected when you do something like this. Then the final 70 or so pages are about Don winning Rosie back and it\u2019s done in such a conventionally rom-com way that I totally lost interest. Worse, Don\u2019s character didn\u2019t seem consistent in this part either (see the criticisms in the Aspergers section above). I\u2019ve used the label \u201cromantic-comedy\u201d throughout because that\u2019s what the marketing says it is but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s romantic, sure, but it\u2019s not funny. I didn\u2019t laugh once and didn\u2019t think Don\u2019s numerous social faux pas to be particularly funny either. Worse still are the scenes which are clumsily designed to be funny and feel very forced, like when Don is learning sexual positions from a book and uses a skeleton (he\u2019s at the university for this scene so it\u2019s not a Dahmer moment or anything) and the Dean walks in on him. It feels like the kind of scene in a sitcom where the canned laughter goes on and on as the camera switches from Don\u2019s face to the Dean\u2019s and back again while the audience begins to clap and laugh at the same time. It might as well be labelled \u201cfunny scene\u201d. And it\u2019s not. Despite my criticisms, I was quite happy to give this book 3 stars - until I read the end. Now I know the ending shouldn\u2019t have more importance over any other aspect of the story, whatever the genre, but the ending to this book is especially bad. So Rosie, at the very start when she\u2019s introduced to Don, tells him about her dad Phil, a man who raised her alone after her mum died when Rosie was 12, who\u2019s a person whom she doesn\u2019t particularly get along with (largely because of a minor quibble which she\u2019s unreasonably held against him for her entire life) - but no more so than any other person who doesn\u2019t get along with their mum or dad for whatever reason. Except she\u2019s convinced herself he can\u2019t possibly be her real dad and that her real dad must be out there somewhere. This is basically the motivation for everything Don and Rosie do in this entire book and right off, I thought \u201cI bet it turns out Phil IS her real dad after all\u201d. Well... I won\u2019t give it away but you can kind of guess what happens in the end. And I really, really hated that. Don all but says what I was feeling in the second-to-final sentence of the book and I immediately dropped the book down another star. This book definitely has some good moments and Don is a memorable and oftentimes delightful character, but the final third of the book really frustrated me. If the book had been more tightly edited with the NY sequence thrown out and had had a less predictable ending, I would be enthusiastically recommending this novel. As it is, it is a flawed debut novel that\u2019s well written but severely lacking in crucial parts of the story reducing it from a charmingly quirky romance story to yet another rom-com with no surprises and a sloppily rushed final act. Graeme Simsion can write and he might one day write a brilliant novel but sadly \u201cThe Rosie Project\u201d is not that book. ...more Actual rating : 3.5 stars From the moment I finished it I knew I had one critical task to perform : To review this project book .

After a prompt analyze of this data, I take the decision to write this review which will be as evidence-based as possible, that is to say, close to none . \u2190 Please refer to option #3 to understand why. \u25a7 Subject 1 : Don, narrator . \u2714 Gender : Male \u2714 Age : 39 \u2714 Appearance : Average, but the presence of a six-pack due to extreme Aikido training deserves to be mentioned. The clothing is practical, highly influenced by a) the weather, b) that's about it . Please don't talk about jacket if your meaning is limited to \"conventional jacket\" , otherwise you would have to face an hilarious misunderstanding. Now that I think about it, please mislead us, that's too deliciously funny to forget. \"But why, why, why can't people just say what they mean?\" \u2714 Relationship status : After realizing that many women didn't get his over-organized way of living, Don decided to start the Wife Project , following the batshit crazy idea where women have to apply to a questionnaire - I KNOW!! - to decipher if a relationship would be sustainable. \u25b6 Sub-mentioned project will lead to : a) Awkward and head-desk situations which still always remain smile-inducing and never maddening (it seems important to mention because the Wife Project can appear to objectify women (it does - but that's clear from the beginning that Don is wrong). Well, you'll probably be annoyed by him at some point, but don't worry, subject 2 is coming. b) As previously mentioned, hilarious misunderstandings . \"I turned to see him - he was large and angry. In order to prevent further violence, I was forced to sit on him. 'Get the fuck off me. I'll fucking kill you,' he said. On that basis, it seemed illogical to grant his request.\" c) Adorable and swoon-worthy scenes from the moment subject 2 is introduced. Yes, because there is EVOLUTION in Don's character. I know, big word, right? Exciting. \u25a7 Subject 2 : Rosie, troublemaker . \u2714 Gender : Female Oh, FUCK THAT. I'm not a scientist by any means. You want to know who Rosie is? \u25b6 Let me tell you : she's an utterly likeable female lead who's going to bring the unexpected in Don's life, shatter his (numerous) believes and stereotypes, and make you love her in the process. Smart, strong-minded, sarcastic, sure of her value as a person , the madness she personifies stirs up the winds of freedom in Don's life and damn, I enjoyed that something fierce. Note that by madness I mean \"not as overly strict as Don\" , so her description can be applied to any woman who doesn't want to be imprisoned in an artificial straightjacket, and loathes that some guys think that women are only good to cook and fuck. I say yes to this . \u25a7 Controversies : The Butterfly Problem . At this point you might wonder why I'm only giving it 3.5 stars. The fact is, as awesome as I found the idea and the execution of it, I felt underwhelmed at times . In a word, it lacked feels for me. As it is, I'm able to point that's The Rosie Project is an original and cute read , but the butterflies were too rare, even if they were here for sure ( note that several scenes will make you Awww out loud ). What can I say? I need my shoot at butterflies. However, I can't deny that the character of Don, the fact that's his POV, drives this lack of feels so maybe that's the point , you know? That's why I rounded up my rating to a 4. \u25a7 Results : Why should you read this book? Because The Rosie Project is a tale of metamorphose, by the acceptance of others for who they truly are and the acceptance of who WE are . Can I say? For all his awkwardness, and surely because of it , Don is an adorable and heartbreaking character whose desire to fit in moved me - because the world we're living in doesn't always accept differences and that's a shame in my opinion. A fucking huge one. In a word? Such an originally written cute romance . \"I asked you here tonight because when you realise you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.\" [ Last edited : June 2016 ] For more of my reviews, please visit: ...more I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Not accurate for someone with Asperger's - they actually have intense emotions but are unable to express them very well. But the author redeems himself by communicating that in the end and adds a very insightful point which is that perhaps Rosie needs to also be more accepting and not expect Don to change his core being. Very much a neurodiversity message. I absolutely LOVE Don's address to the parents of young Asperger's students. It is brilliant and very amusing. And I knew I liked Don the moment he decided the following about Asperger's: \"I formed a provisional conclusion that most of these were simply variations in human brain function that had been inappropriately medicalised because they did not fit social norms - constructed social norms - that reflected the most common human configuration rather than the full range.\" ...more How addictive was this book?

He compiles an extensive (and logical) list of the qualities he wants in a wife to start \"The Wife Project,\" but gets sidetracked by \"The Father Project\" of a twenty-something woman named Rosie. Their story takes place around a mission to grab sneaky DNA samples from a bunch of men in order to find Rosie's dad. The author perfectly captured Don's voice and it's the strongest part of the story by far. A couple people close to me have Asperger's and I was pretty shocked by how similar Don's thoughts and actions were at times! Some parts where he knew he didn't fit in were a little sad, but it was pretty optimistic for the most part. I would have liked Rosie's character to be a bit more developed, but I suppose the story is seen through Don's eyes. It's nothing terribly complex or fast-paced, but it was a genuinely fun read with really cute characters! ...more This book made me laugh. Not many books can do that. This was a truly delightful book to read and I would never ask for a minute of the time spent reading it back. Made all the more amazing by the fact that it is the first novel of Melbourne writer Graeme Simsion, The Rosie Project will rank highly amongst my 2013 reads. Written from a unique perspective, this is one of the few, if not the only, romantic comedies with a male protagonist. And not only male, but autistic.

Written from a unique perspective, this is one of the few, if not the only, romantic comedies with a male protagonist. And not only male, but autistic. Don Tillman is a brilliant scientist, but a hapless socialist (I mean that with no political leanings, Don literally sucks at being social.) Rosie is beautiful, smart and nowhere close to what Don sees as a perfect life partner. This book is one of those rare gems that most people could relate to on some level. Does he love me? Does she love me? Can two people really be destined for one another? Is mankind meant for monogamy? Can anyone really love? Written with a one of a kind voice, you experience all of Don's ups and downs as he over-analyses, fears and then embraces change and eventually learns how to love. This is a beautiful love story. ...more 4.5 'Nerds Need Love Too' stars. This wasn't a traditional romance novel, but I enjoyed the romantic aspect of this story quite a bit.

The hero, Don Tillman, is a 39 y/o socially inept scientist who lives his life based on strict rules. He never believed that love, romance and marriage was for him. But when a friend comments on his likeliness of being an excellent husband, he rethinks his possibilities. Because of his lack of social awareness he reaches out to his friend and co-worker, a professor of psychology, who is experienced in human relationships. They devise a plan to help Don find a wife, and his buddy (along with his wife) advises Don nearly every step of the way. In his quest to find the perfect wife, he creates an online dating profile with an extensive survey based on a wide range of desirable attributes, but in the meantime while he is waiting for Ms Perfect he devotes his time to helping a lady named Rosie find her biological father. This story had a lot of fun twists and turns, and a few predictable parts. I thoroughly enjoyed the journey these two took that ultimately had them discovering more about themselves and what is truly important. At first I couldn't imagine how the author was going to convince me that these two seemingly opposite types could fall in love and have a chance for happily-ever-after, but by the end I was a believer. The Rosie Project is less of a romance and more of a tale of one mans journey to find love and discover some truths about himself. By the way, I listened to this one on audiobook, and loved the narrator! I highly recommended the audio format. ...more Don, If you were real I would marry you in a heartbeat. \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 I enjoyed every single minute of this book! I knew it'd be a favorite because I've lived it! There is a \"Don\" in my life, and I was very clearly put on the \"unsuitable\" list, but we've remained good friends. It's hard not to love these sort of characters (real or fictitious). I wager that this will be a film in the not too distant future. Even though it's an Australian book, I can't help but peg Lizzy Caplan as Rosie. *sigh* Just need a few more minutes to let it all sink in... Don Tillman is an absolute hoot! I loved his odd, technical way of speaking. Don is a professor of genetics and he's looking for someone to share his life with. He's socially-awkward, lonely, and over- analytical to a fault. He's pushing 40 and he's had a difficult time in the romance department. One day, he decides to start a project - which he hilariously calls, \"The Wife Project\".

It's basically a detailed, yet rambling questionnaire of the requirements/preferences he's searching for in a long-term partner. Enter Rosie Jarman, a 29 year-old psychology grad student who \"interrupts\" Don's world dramatically. Rosie is Don's polar opposite. She smokes, drinks like a fish, hates working out, fashionably late, and \"suffers\" from emotional problems. Rosie needs Don's help. She is looking for her biological father. Her mother died in a car accident when she was a little girl, and she never learned his true identity. Since Don's profession is all about facts/genetics - he \"reluctantly\" agrees to help her (The Father Project) even though she's totally unsuitable as a potential wife. \"The Rosie Project\" is a light and breezy novel from start to finish. Don is so rigid and precise and Rosie is so untidy and doesn't like to mince words. Will the old saying, \"opposites attract\" become a factor in Don and Rosie's new friendship? Well, you'll just have to read this hilarious and sweetly unique novel to find out.

Meanwhile, he bumps into a woman named Rosie, who Don agrees is totally unsuitable, but he likes spending time with her anyway. This novel is essentially a romantic comedy, so if you like that genre, you will probably enjoy this. The writing is clever and amusing, and I frequently laughed out loud while reading. Of course Don makes social gaffes, but what I liked is how practical and resilient he was in such situations. He recognized his gifts, such as being smart, dedicated and having an excellent memory, and he used those talents to help him navigate this new world involving Rosie. I was pleased to hear that a sequel was released earlier this year, and I look forward to reading more about Don and Rosie's adventures. Favorite Quotes \"A questionnaire! Such an obvious solution. A purpose-built, scientifically valid instrument incorporating current best practice to filter out the time wasters, the disorganized, the ice-cream discriminators, the visual-harassment complainers, the crystal gazers, the horoscope readers, the fashion obsessives, the religious fanatics, the vegans, the sports watchers, the creationists, the smokers, the scientifically illiterate, the homeopaths, leaving, ideally, the perfect partner, or realistically, a manageable short list of candidates.\" \"Asperger's isn't a fault. It's a variant. It's potentially a major advantage. Asperger's syndrome is associated with organization, focus, innovative thinking, and rational detachment.\" \"Throughout my life I have been criticized for a perceived lack of emotion, as if this were some absolute fault. Interactions with psychiatrists and psychologists ... start from the premise that I should be more 'in touch' with my emotions. What they really mean is that I should give in to them. I am perfectly happy to detect, recognize, and analyze emotions. This is a useful skill and I would like to be better at it. Occasionally an emotion can be enjoyed \u2014 the gratitude I felt for my sister, who visited me even during the bad times, the primitive feeling of well-being after a glass of wine \u2014 but we need to be vigilant that emotions do not cripple us.\" ...more An unconventional take on the Rom-Com genre, but with the same tropes.

In order to do so, he creates a questionnaire in order to filter out all unsuitable women. (Why he doesn\u2019t just use eHarmony is beyond me, since apparently they have a long ass test to take on there too.) Though he is described as a Cary Grant lookalike, I read him more as Zachary Levi. Don\u2019s search to find a wife takes a turn when Rosie enters his office, and all sorts of Rom-Com hijinks ensue. (Sidenote: Just due to her name, I can\u2019t see the character as being played by anyone other than Rosie O\u2019Donnell. It doesn\u2019t fit the description at all, but it\u2019s one of those weird word association things. But how great would it be to see Rosie O\u2019Donnell in a movie with Zachary Levi? It could either be terrible or awesome. *Rings up Hollywood, uses old timey voice: \u201cWe gotta get these two in a picture, see?\u201d Taps ash off cigar*) \u201dHumans often fail to see what is close to them and obvious to others.\u201d P. 82 Coincidentally, Don is giving a presentation about Asperger Syndrome at the beginning of the book, but doesn\u2019t see that he may be on the spectrum himself until much later in the novel. This is a simple case of dramatic irony as readers will be well aware that he has tendencies associated with Asperger\u2019s due to his rigid scheduling and obliviousness to social norms. As Don becomes more self aware, he notices similarities within himself and those he has read up on. \u201cBut my reconfigured mind, sustained by huge doses of positive reinforcement, accepted the proposition.\u201d P.207 Oh My Fair Genetic Reseacher , does Don change over the course of the novel. Since it\u2019s so short, it\u2019s almost like a montage. The twist here is that the girl doesn\u2019t change for the guy, nor does the girl change the guy; it\u2019s that he learns on his own and does it of his own volition\u2026 like a robot learning to love. \u201dLove is a powerful feeling for another person, often defying logic.\u201d P.280 Don\u2019s own logic is challenged and he sees his original plan with the questionnaire was flawed due to several romantic clich\u00e9s that I won\u2019t repeat here. But you get the gist, right? I mean, come on, that quote is basically the book\u2026and almost every romantic movie\u2026ever.

Don Tillman is a socially inept university professor, with very few friends and an extremely rigid lifestyle. He has designed a questionnaire, \"The Wife Project\", to find himself a wife. Unfortunately his standards are incredibly high. However, his project is put on the backburner when he meets the very unconventional Rosie and helps her out with her own project. The writing style was great. As I'm currently in academia, some of the depictions of academics and their thought process really made me laugh. I liked Don's personal development through the course of the book, and also learning how he sees life. Although it wasn't explicitly stated, I think Don has Asperger's Syndrome. I don't know much about this condition but reading it helped me realize not everyone thinks and sees things in the same way.I also loved the deadpan writing of the narrator. I think the story will get you thinking about a lot of things, for example empathy, authenticity, human connection. I'm so glad I read it. ...more Review to come...

His work, exercise, dinner, clothes, well \u2026. EVERYTHING is scheduled to the second with zero variation. The only time Don has really ventured out of his comfort zone was when he befriended Daphne \u2013 a lonely elderly neighbor whose husband had been put in a nursing home. Before Daphne\u2019s own health declines, she proclaims what a wonderful husband Don will be to some lucky girl. It\u2019s at that point Don realizes he should probably get serious about finding himself a wife \u2013 and of course he should do it in the most scientific method imaginable. After all, why let emotions cloud his judgment when science already has all the answers? Enter \u201cThe Wife Project\u201d \u2013 a survey that will find a perfect mate. There\u2019s only one problem - Rosie, an applicant to the project sent in by Don\u2019s friend Gene, didn\u2019t answer the questions correctly, but Don still enjoys her company. After realizing there is no hope in a romantic future together, Don decides to help conduct \u201cThe Father Project\u201d and find Rosie\u2019s biological father. Eventually both projects fizzle out, but Don still can\u2019t get Rosie out of his head. Embracing a new view of life, including a dayplanner containing only the most basic appointments, a new wardrobe and dating advice straight from \u201cHitch\u201d, the only question that remains is - will the \u201cDon Project\u201d be a success or a failure? I\u2019ve noticed for each handful of positive reviews, someone out there is posting a scathing counterpart. These reviews say the author has made light of a medical condition or the author has completely gotten his facts wrong or the author should have written a serious book rather than a comedy if he was going to broach this subject matter or the author is simply a huge ass or blah blah blah blah blah. I\u2019m all for free speech, but I question why someone seeks out a book that they know will make them miserable? We all fall victim to the \u201cwhoops, thought this was going to be great and I ended up hating it instead\u201d novel, but to actively seek something out just so you can flame it? Wellllllll, there\u2019s a crazy person in that scenario, but it sure as heck isn\u2019t Don from The Rosie Project . Okay, now that I got that out of my system, let\u2019s proceed. I definitely didn\u2019t have an agenda to worry about when I picked this up (since I\u2019m offended by nearly nothing, I\u2019m guessing that probably will never be a problem). In fact, I knew ZILCH about this book except that my friends here at Goodreads were reading it in droves and they would not dare steer me wrong. My assumption was correct. This book is stinking adorable! It made me so incredibly smiley when I had been having a bit of an \u201coff\u201d week. I loved the fresh perspective on the age old boy meets girl story. I can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed out loud (at my desk \u2013 during the lunch hour \u2013 like an insane person) at a book. If you want to read something that will change the world (or at least your life), The Rosie Project is more than likely the wrong choice. On the other hand, if you just want to get lost for a few hours in a book that makes you feel better after you\u2019re finished than you did before, I highly recommend checking it out.

Porque ser\u00e1??? Quanto a mim, h\u00e1 duas raz\u00f5es a considerar: A primeira tem a ver com a condi\u00e7\u00e3o humana. Com a incessante busca de equil\u00edbrio que por vezes se manifesta na uni\u00e3o de dois seres que individualmente s\u00e3o desequilibrados, mas juntos, s\u00e3o capazes dum N\u00f3s harmonioso - o que \u00e9 excessivo num, est\u00e1 carente no outro! A segunda tem tudo a ver com o Amor em si. Se num casal, os membros que o constituem, tiverem caracter\u00edsticas demasiado pr\u00f3ximas, \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que cada um esteja a amar-se a si mesmo no outro. Se pelo contr\u00e1rio, funcionarem em campos opostos, ent\u00e3o s\u00f3 o Amor ser\u00e1 a Cola que mant\u00e9m viva a sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o! Don e Rosie enquadram-se neste tipo de casais. Don \u00e9 ultra-racional: organizado, pontual, matematicamente dotado , e sempre com o dia planeado \u00e0 escala do micro-segundo! Rosie est\u00e1 nos ant\u00edpodas: emotiva e matematicamente pouco dotada, pouco ou nada investe na organiza\u00e7\u00e3o e pontualidade que Don tanto aprecia! Por\u00e9m, algo ir\u00e1 juntar estes dois: Rosie pretende encontrar o seu pai biol\u00f3gico, o que desperta o interesse de Don, cuja especialidade \u00e9 a gen\u00e9tica! Ao ser o homem certo que surge no momento certo da vida de Rosie, Don vai-se aproximando e assim se v\u00e3o conhecendo, descobrindo e apaixonando... Para Don, em cujo curriculum sobre relacionamentos amorosos s\u00f3 constam uma meia d\u00fazia de primeiros encontros, se tanto, esta nova etapa da sua vida ser\u00e1 como ir a Marte a bordo dum disco voador!... Uma com\u00e9dia bem simp\u00e1tica, onde mais uma vez somos confrontados com o poder desse m\u00e1gico e estranho sentimento que d\u00e1 pelo nome de Amor. Vale a Pena! A capa n\u00e3o \u00e9 l\u00e1 muito chamativa, mas o conte\u00fado compensa largamente!! Leiam e divirtam-se!!! :) ...more The Rosie project was a book I picked out on a whim while browsing through audible, as I wanted something light to listen to while running.

I found it quite predictable in places and I didn't fall in love with the characters. There were times I felt the story dragged but this was possibly because I became bored with the narrative. If I am honest about this one I think perhaps it may come across better if read than in audio format as I think it dragged in the audio version and probably better suited for reading. The Rosie Project was a hit for many but just didn't work for me. The wonderful thing about being a reader is that while I may not have loved the book I rarely regret reading any books as there is still the prospect of an entertaining discussion with friends. ...more 4\u2605 To date 53 friends, and now myself, have reviewed or rated this book.

For me it was a case of the right book at the right time. I enjoyed the unconventional approach and humor on the subject of wanting to fit in and find love despite all our weirdness and quirks. A quick read that was original, fun, seriously lighthearted, and made no demands except laughter on me. A perfect pairing with Cakebread Cellars Ros\u00e9 over a very hot and smokey-from-wildfires California week. ...more", "Title": "The Rosie Project"},
