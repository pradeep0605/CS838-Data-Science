A lot of us really enjoy books. But because we are average joes, commoners, small potatoes, this is nothing groundbreaking. It likely will not become upsetting if we take up reading as a hobby. But what if someone important takes up reading, at a late stage in life? What if that somebody is more than important--what if that person is a figurehead, an influential presence of tradition, or otherwise very powerful, in oblique ways? What if that person happened to be the Queen of England? That's the premise of this romping little read that has a surprising amount of substance. Queen Elizabeth stumbles across a bookmobile by the palace, feels compelled by good manners to check out a book, struggles through it, returns it, and again feels compelled to take out another. This one she finds delightful, and so the die is cast. This is so completely out of character for the Queen--she allows herself few hobbies and interests that would indicate a preference for anything, and now here she is, preferring books, developing a love for them, and as she reads more and more, developing some pretty heavy ideas that influence the person she is and how she reigns and interacts with her subjects. But not everyone likes this new habit, hobby, tendency, addiction, whatever. RA librarians will recognize some of the arguments that the Queen's politicians and such make: Reading is selfish. Reading isolates you. Reading will alienate others from you. It's one thing to read this in an RA textbook; it hits home a lot harder when you read it being discussed in a fiction book. The book is mainly dialogue-driven, with a fair amount of character development being devoted to the Queen. It all gets resolved in a tidy, unexpected, funny, and completely ludicrous manner at the end, and the ending is suitably off-beat, just like the rest of the book.

It\u2019s very realistic for how reading changes your outlook and how one book leads to another. I would like to convey enough from the book to hook you, but would not like to spoil any of your fun. I choose to share a sample of her reaction to one book, an example of resistance by others to her reading, and one distillation of the appeal of reading to her. Near the beginning the story, it was the second book the Queen read that got her hooked, a romance by Nancy Mitford: The Pursuit of Love turned out to be a fortunate choice and in its way a momentous one. Had Her Majesty gone for another duff read, an early George Eliot, say, or a late Henry James, novice reader that she was, she might have been put off reading for good and there would be no story to tell. Books, she would have thought, were work. As it was, with this one she soon became engrossed, and passing her bedroom that night clutching his hot-water bottle, the duke heard her laugh out loud. He put his head around the door. 'All right, old girl?' 'Of course, I'm reading.' The Queen encounters diverse reactions to her reading and a bit of conspiracy led by her PR manager, Sir Kevin, to thwart her new passion: \u2018To read is to withdraw. To make oneself unavailable. One would feel easier about it,\u2019 said Sir Kevin, \u2018if the pursuit itself were less \u2026selfish.\u2019 \u2018Selfish?\u2019 \u2018Perhaps I should say solipsistic.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps you should.\u2019 Here is one of the Queen\u2019s insights about the power of reading for her: The appeal of reading, she thought, lay in its indifference: there was something undeferring about literature. Books didn\u2019t care who was reading them or not. All readers were equal, herself included. So as you can see, we have a bit of a fable on the subversive power of reading. There are no specific cases of the content of a specific book inciting high passions or inspiring intellectual conclusions that alter critical political choices. The restraint on the part of Bennett in this way somehow makes it more compelling and moving to experience the impact of reading on the Queen\u2019s daily life and empathy for people of different walks of life. ...more Rating: 4.125* of five Witty, irreverent, and completely charming, Bennett's novella is one I would sincerely hope that Her Majesty read and laughed at when it was published. There are many reviews of this effervescent entertainment, so I will confine myself to noting that the book carries with it a none-too-subtle punch line which I can't imagine would have made Mr. Bennett more likely to be in line for a life peerage, but which I can imagine made him a popular figure around Highgrove.

It was as if he was talking to his grandmother, and not for the first time the Queen was made unpleasantly aware of the hostility her reading seemed to arouse. 'Very well,' she said. 'Then you should inform security that I shall expect to find another copy of the same book, vetted and explosive-free, waiting on my desk tomorrow morning. And another thing. The carriage cushions are filthy. Look at my gloves.' Her Majesty departed.

She doesn\u2019t want to talk about anything else but books and tortures her subjects constantly asking their opinions on this author or another. Don\u2019t I know what it\u2019s like!

It's only here, on goodreads, that I feel I am understood. Bennett beautifully describes the progress we make as readers, how every book sets a bar higher and we are able to take on more complex and ambitious books. That, of course, will never happen if you just read paranormal romance for the rest of your days. Bennett also proposes a thesis that reading must eventually lead to writing. He believes in supremacy of writing over reading, believes it to be somewhat nobler than reading. I am not sure I agree with this. It takes a whole lot of self-control, modesty (and obviously being a better person than I am) to be satisfied with reading only and not have that grandiose need to write. It was also quite brave of Bennett to take on the Queen as his heroine. And to make her into a human being as well! I applaud you, sir. To be honest with you, if there was a good thing about growing up in a communist country it was that absolute certainty that people are equal. And then I came to UK. I find this whole business of Royal Family and aristocracy extremely funny/sad. In my work I deal with quite a lot of Lords and Ladies and such and was trained in addressing them correctly. I thought it was very cute and funny until I realized that my employers are actually for real. Until I saw the CEO assuming a very submissive tone when speaking to the Earl of ThisorThat.

However, instead of pursuing a queenly hobby (ahem, don\u2019t ask me what that is), she stumbles upon a mobile library just outside her gates and pursues reading; what ensues thereafter is a barrel full of fun, at least until the very end. Alan Bennett\u2019s, The Uncommon Reader, has been on my TBR since a very long time. To be honest, I don\u2019t remember when or why I added it to my TBR as I don\u2019t even remember reading the blurb, which incidentally is true of most of my TBR additions. *ahem* don\u2019t kill me for this. Anyway, I needed a book with a crown on the cover for a challenge and was struggling with the book that I had picked, when a friend of mine, Margaret, suggested that I read this book. Her recommendation was based on the fact that this was small and hence a very quick read. Short it is and a quick read it was, full of funny events that take place once the Queen takes up reading as a hobby and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bennett makes The Queen the protagonist of this book and through her explains the delight that most booklovers experience and feel when they are reading. The book is peppered with quotes that are truly a reader\u2019s delight. Being a reader, ever since I could hold a book in my hands, I enjoyed these quotes and references a lot. Let me give you a few examples; \u201cWhat she was finding also was how one book led to another, doors kept opening wherever she turned and the days weren\u2019t long enough for the reading she wanted to do.\u201d Don\u2019t we all experience that when we read? I, for one, have gotten many of my book recommendations through references made in other books that I am reading or have read. My constantly increasing TBR is proof to the fact that no matter how much you read, the options are endless, which is both exciting and intimidating. The Queen goes onto describe her passion and addiction with these words; \u201cTo begin with, it\u2019s true, she read with trepidation and some unease. The sheer endlessness of books outfaced her and she had no idea how to go on; there was no system to her reading, with one book leading to another, and often she had two or three on the go at the same time. The next stage had been when she started to make notes, after which she always read with a pencil in hand, not summarising what she read but simply transcribing passages that struck her\u201d All of us do this as well. When I read physical books, I use the same method of transcribing quotes that have a special place in my heart. With the Kindle it is so easy to simply highlight it and come back to it whenever I want. I thrive on highlighting and often wonder why I can\u2019t do the same with physical books. Lol. Jokes aside, wanting to immortalize in our minds, what we have read, especially those special parts, is something that is dear to all readers and Bennett has exquisitely put forth this truth in his book. The Queen\u2019s addiction creates havoc among the palace staff and also the ministry. Where they used to find a complacent Queen quietly listening to their reports, they now had a well read Queen ready to debate on various topics and worse asking them whether they had read a particular book or not. Ministers, dignitaries from other countries and even the palace staff are not spared from these musings, which results in a merry tale that has the reader in splits. The Queen spares none and through her Bennett doesn\u2019t spare them either, be it those who show disdain towards readers or those who read to simply pass the time. Through the Queen, here is his fitting reply; \u201cPass the time?\u201d said the Queen. \u201cBooks are not about passing the time. They\u2019re about other lives. Other worlds. Far from wanting time to pass, Sir Kevin, one just wishes one had more of it. If one wanted to pass the time one could go to New Zealand.\u201d This is definitely a praise worthy book but somehow it lost its pace towards the end. What started off as a humorous account of the Queen taking up reading turned into something that felt contrived and out of place towards the end. It was as if the author was trying to say something but his message did not get across as easily as it did in the previous pages. It became serious all of a sudden and took away all the fun and frolic that was there in the initial pages, which irked me a lot. Nevertheless, this is a good book to read, especially as we are all bibliophiles and enjoy reading books about books and reading. ...more This new novella from the pen of Alan Bennett (author of the The History Boys ) is without a doubt the funniest book I have read in recent memory.

Imagine the Queen of England patronizing a lending library van, and then imagine her actually reading books. The incongruity of the situation leads to hilarious consequences for the Queen, her family, her household This new novella from the pen of Alan Bennett (author of the The History Boys ) is without a doubt the funniest book I have read in recent memory. I started it while riding home on the bus and had a hard time keeping my seat as my laughter was almost nonstop. What a wonderful premise! Imagine the Queen of England patronizing a lending library van, and then imagine her actually reading books. The incongruity of the situation leads to hilarious consequences for the Queen, her family, her household and her subjects. From the title, a not-too-subtle reference to Virginia Woolf, to the end of this book I had a riot of uproariously fun reading. However, amidst all this fun there was a serious message about the nature, power and importance of reading: a subject that must be near and dear to the heart of the author (if you have any doubts I refer you to The History Boys ) and which all readers will continue to appreciate and wonder upon after the laughter has died away. ...more Beautiful novella, imagining the effect on courtiers, corgis and protocol if the Queen develops a reading habit. The books she chooses are carefully chosen by Bennett to illuminate her metamorphosis. The main danger is reading it too quickly to savour it as it deserves. Bennett at his best. You may not be such a voracious reader if you could not relate to this novella. The story is simple but interesting. It is about the queen of England, an UNCOMMON READER (look its meaning up in Wikepedia), who will fall to reading books when she meets across a travelling library. There she meets Norman, the kitchen boy, who will introduce her to different writers she has never met yet. The queen will completely immerse herself in books, derelict in her duty as Her Majesty of England. Ad nauseam b You may not be such a voracious reader if you could not relate to this novella.

Ad nauseam because of her special advisor, Sir Kevin, she will be in a quandary over whether reading affects her duty or not. Like Her Majesty, I prefer to be left to my reading. I don\u2019t want to be disturbed. I don\u2019t want to procrastinate reading, but I do procrastinate doing the job I must do. Like Her Majesty, I make excuses not to do anything else because I want books be under my nose all the time. Like Her Majesty, I\u2019d rather read a book on a vehicle or whenever I travel, carrying a stack of books I try to catch upon than watch a movie or strike up a conversation with my friend/s. Like Her majesty, I sleep through my books because they keep me awake, but half awake with the books I find kitsch, so I lay them aside until they get caked with dust bunny. Like Her Majesty, I read a book with a pad and a pencil close at my hand to take notes the words I haven\u2019t known yet and to underline the quotes boggle my mind at the same time. Like Her Majesty, I love frequenting my favorite stomping ground to check upon the unknown in my world. Like Her Majesty, I am brainwashed by the totally ridiculous opinions of the significant others, unenthusiastic about books. To them, reading is time killing. Like Her Majesty, it is too late to learn a lot of things more since she had been up to her nose with her duty, in my case, poverty. Thus, we are both OPSIMATHS as she puts it. I bet my boots you bear complete resemblance to Her Majesty, don\u2019t you? But unlike Her Majesty, I will never give up on my \u201cnatural or learned\u2019 inclination till Kingdom come despite my demanding job. ^___^ Out of 29 authors mentioned in the novella, I should proudly say that I am very familiar with 17 of them such as: \u2022\tAnita Brookner \u2022\tThomas Hardy \u2022\t Winifred Holtby \u2022\tHenry James \u2022\tAlice Munro \u2022\tThe Bront\u00ebs \u2022\tMarcel Proust \u2022\tPhilip Roth \u2022\tVikram Seth \u2022\tWilliam Shakespeare \u2022\tCharles Dickens \u2022\tWilliam Makepeace Thackeray \u2022\tJane Austen \u2022\tGeorge Eliot \u2022\tE.

Essentially a parable about the life-changing potential of an appreciation for good literature, it displays Bennett's caustic intelligence and wit to great advantage. Choosing Queen Elizabeth II as his protagonist gives Bennett amazing scope for making his point about reading good books. After all, if the Queen's life can be changed in both small and monumental ways through reading, so can the life of anyone who falls in love with literature. Through the use of the Queen as a character, Bennett is also able to weave into the narrative a sharp but entertaining commentary on British politics and society. And of course, from the books that Bennett has the Queen love, like and not really care for, I suspect that I now have a pretty fair idea of Bennett's own tastes in literature. Possibly not the main point of the novel, but something to store away for future reference. Highly recommended for anyone who knows what it's like to be obsessed with books. Oh, and it's full of very quotable quotes about writers, books and the joys of reading. ...more An experience so delightful that I want to leave the joy of discovery to the reader.

Just because it is light in weight does not mean it is lightweight. Indeed it is a most rewarding and insightful story, told with great economy and style by one of Britain\u2019s critically acclaimed writers. A chance encounter between a mobile library, a skinny young cook and the Queen of England, with corgis in train, leads to a minor Palace revolution. QE2 takes up reading with a passion, with the assistance of the weedy Norman, and it changes her entire outlook on life. Not only does reading literature change her, but it affects the entire conduct of her public life, something that does not sit well with her retinue of advisors and assistants. Bennett uses this scenario to explore two main issues; firstly the importance and value of books and reading, and secondly the nature and status of the monarch, in particular her public persona. The book abounds with insightful comments, which I found quite thought-provoking: The appeal of reading\u2026lay in its indifference: there was something lofty about literature. Books did not care who was reading them or whether one read them or not. All readers were equal, herself included. [The Queen] read, of course, as one did, but liking books was something she left to other people. It was a hobby and it was in the nature of her job that she didn\u2019t have hobbies\u2026Hobbies involved preferences and preferences had to be avoided; preferences excluded people\u2026Her job was to take an interest, not to be interested herself. In a nation riddled with class consciousness, Bennett describes the Queen in a most intriguing, indeed provocative way. Her royalty isolates her from everyone else in Britain, so far above them is her status: \u2026to her everybody\u2019s name was immaterial, as indeed was everything else, their clothes, their voice, their class. She was a genuine democrat, perhaps the only one in the country. Initially QE2 was attracted to the books suggested by Norman because she gained insights into the human condition. She saw it as her duty to read, in order to understand her subjects better. Because she saw herself as a 'doer', she needed the excuse of duty in order to indulge her enjoyment. But after a while she read for the simple pleasure of it, and broadened her reading material to include biographies, histories and the classics. Her absorption in the world of literature had a considerable impact on her ability to participate fully in the timetable of public appearances which had been her lot for so many decades. While she continued to perform publicly her mind was elsewhere, much to the consternation of the Royal household, who stage-managed her movements with such meticulous attention to detail. They thought she might be slipping into senility. How wrong they were! After a few years of voracious reading, the Queen started making notes, recording her reactions and thoughts about the material she read. As time passed she became certain that it was her duty to write down her ideas for posterity. Again her advisors were exasperated. The final scene of the book is set around her 80th birthday, where she throws a huge party for all of her advisors, past and present. She causes quite a stir by announcing her intention to persist with her writing, and Bennett uses this plot development to present us with an amusing and satisfactory ending to the novella. This is a charming, witty book, a light read if you like, but which has layers of meaning if you wish to look below the surface. In my mind it confirms Alan Bennett as a master of compassionate observation of the human condition, and of a gentle, though incisive humour. 4.5 \u2605s ...more The Queen of England as a late-in-life book lover, annoying her staff and confusing the public as she undergoes the personal change that only reading and writing can effect.

I received this book in the mail today, and immediately sat down with it, finishing in a couple of hours. This never happens: I usually let new books sit for quite a while before the bug really strikes, but it's a credit to this book in every way that I was unable to put it down before I was finished. Not only is the regal appearance, (mid-size paperback, yet with rough-cut pages and dust-jacket-style cover) every bit as appealing as the novella length, (a scant 120 pages) but the premise is so delightfully silly, the wit so potent, yet so subtle, that no reader can help but succumb blissfully to its charms. Once we get used to the idea of the queen visiting the mobile library, hiding books in her carriage for a little stealth reading, and neglecting the Prime Minister while on holiday in order to finish Proust, the story deepens a bit. As the Queen begins to notice how her life is changing as a result of reading, and also writing, she meditates (more or less) on the very real human need to acquire knowledge and to use the mind to create. Highly recommended to bibliophiles and -phobes alike. Addendum: This review was written in 2008, when I first received the book as an advance reader copy. I listened to the audiobook in 2013, and it is just as delightful the second time around. :) ...more Despite the New Zealand bashing (poor Sir Kevin), I enjoyed this short quaint novella about the Queen taking up reading as hobby.
