I hope there is lots more action and intensity in the final installment :) What would you choose if you had the faith of someone you love in your hands? Would you betray your beliefs? I must confess that the only honest answer I can give you is... Of course I'd be so proud if I was able to say that I'd do the right thing whatever it takes, and I want to think I'd do it. Really. Of course there are situations where what to do is obvious because one of the possibilities is utterly bad . But sometimes - sometimes there's no such thing as a right choice .

The main characters are young, aren't they? Yes... But still . Is it enough to tell? Really? Because this book?! It actually made me think more than most of those I've read for years . And I read a lot . <+++>The Ask and the Answer</+++> gives rise to ethical reflection and disturbs us. What is it that makes you a good person? Is there a boundary line? Where is it, I'm asking, where is it? Is it what you do ? What you think ? What you allow others to do? WHERE? - Blur - \"And they seem to unnerstand. That's the thing. They unnerstand way more than a sheep would.\" Make no mistakes, I hated Mayor Prentiss - President - Prentiss something fierce. I really did, from the beginning. Then, I never liked a lot this Mistress Coyle either. But these choices our characters must face? They're difficult. Harsh. *blush* Can I say it? I only wanted for Todd and Viola to be safe. To be together. To be happy. Yes, I can be idealist that way. And maybe it makes me a coward, maybe it makes me weak, but - There was a moment I was just thinking one damn thing : \"Run!\" Fuck 'em all , and run! (shut up) But of course it'd be selfish. Of course life isn't so simple. And of course the story would be over, and way less interesting. I may be a romantic but not that dumb. I know that. But still . I'm just saying I thought about it. Fortunately for us, readers who want to be moved but oh my god that's so harsh - Fortunately for us, Todd and Viola are amazing characters and oh so more stronger than me. I'll let you know something : This book is a gem, a real one, but that was painful. \"Cuz she's out there somewhere. (please be out there somewhere) (please be okay) (please)\" I've said my heart ached for Todd in The Knife of Never Letting Go ? Scratch that : It just broke in this one. All over again . I sure can't say that I agreed with all the choices he made. It'd be far from the true - some of his actions are really unforgivable (view spoiler) [one word : 1017 (hide spoiler) ] . But, you know, <---A>Patrick Ness</---A> is such a genius - yes, because I know that the talent (or the lack of) of a writer plays a large part in our feelings towards the characters - that even if I hated Todd sometimes, I couldn't help but love him. Something fierce. Whatever it takes . That's the whole point, huh? (Viola?) You could think that this sentence, \"Love is stronger than anything\" is a pious platitude. You'd be right. I mean, we all know how this sentence is often used in romance novels to, you know, try to hide the lack of plot ? And yet you'd be so wrong. This book is not a romance. So then? Where does it lead us? To a wonderful book about choices . The choices we make and why we make them and how can we be sure that we're right? We just can't. Let it be known that I will forever be destroyed by this quote. FOREVER - \"And someone calls, \"Murderer!\" from across the square. But of course it can't be her - But at least there's someone. At least there's someone.\" ... Because what are we hoping but for someone to speak up? I want to be that person, and even if I'm not gonna lie, it scares me to death, I sure hope I would be, because what's the point of life if we can witness atrocities and just stand there? I am in awe of Patrick Ness . His books are brilliant, and I'm already looking forward to reading the next. Because of course there's a cliffhanger. Again. Edit 05/29 : I've started editing this review, but nothing could express my confusion and emotion more than the few words I wrote straight away. Perhaps it's for the best that my obsessional perfectionism can't influence everything. Perhaps sometimes, beautiful sentences and neat organization would be nothing else but a lie.

This is an even more important book than part one, though admittedly not quite as fast-paced. It deals with very grown up issues like feminism, terrorism, war and genocide; another reason why I have to reiterate my point that this trilogy should not be solely aimed at kids. The alternating narrative works well and develops the reader's bond with the character of Viola. For me, it was an even darker novel than the first book with Ness sparing no details on the violence and torture undergone by those suspected of being members of the Answer. It's a very shocking story and it questions what makes a person 'good' and whether an individual is solely responsible for their actions or if society and social factors can be blamed. Ness openly tackles the possibility of redemption in the most dire cases and he carefully blurs the lines between hero and villain. Is it okay to sacrifice one innocent person for the greater good? How about a thousand? Is terrorism a crime or a fight for freedom? The answers you think you have now may not be so easily applied when reading this book, it has the ability to question all which you've ever believed in. ...more **Some spoilers for those who have not read the first book** I just wrote an exhausting review of this novel, but Goodreads screwed me and lost the entire thing.

Pissed does not even begin to cover what I feel right now. All of that brilliance, now lost to the cyberspace void forever. I didn't so much read the first book in this series, The Knife of Never Letting Go , as inhaled it. Original and disturbing, Ness is not afraid to take some risks as he tells the story of Todd Hewitt, a boy about to become a man in Prentisstown--a town inhabited only by men. As we read, we find out that Todd lives on a colony planet so distant from Earth that it takes decades to get there. Upon arrival, the first colonists went to war with the indigenous inhabitants, the Spackle. In a desperate effort to defeat the invaders, the Spackle release a germ that kills all of the women. The men survive, but with a strange side-effect: they can hear each other's internal monologue. At least this is the story Todd was always told, but when he discovers a real girl in the swamp Todd is forced to flee for his life and learns that everything he thought was true is a lie. The Ask and the Answer picks up where The Knife of Never Letting Go left off. Todd and Viola, whose uneasy truce forged a devoted friendship, are separated when Mayor Prentiss (the antagonist from the first novel) names himself President, quarantines the women from the men, and establishes martial law in New Prentisstown. As Mayor Prentiss exerts his power, a female rebel force known as the Answer rises against him, and Viola finds herself swept up by their cause. Meanwhile, Todd is forced to do President Prentiss's bidding in order to keep Viola safe. He's put in charge of managing the enslaved Spackle workforce being used to build the New Prentisstown envisioned by the President. What is so fascinating about the novel is how Ness explores the brainwashing and mind games employed by each side as they use Viola and Todd as expendable pawns in their quest for victory. Viola struggles with the terroristic tactics used by the Answer against innocent civilians in the name of their cause, while Todd is forced to face his shame in killing a Spackle in the first novel as he witnesses the dehumanizing treatment of the thinking and feeling alien race. As Viola and Todd try to navigate the labyrinthine truths, loyalties, and beliefs that are relics from a war that occurred before either of them were born, they begin to question themselves and their trust in each other. This psychological complexity is heightened by the fact that the reader still isn\u2019t sure who the bad guys and who the good guys are\u2014if, in fact, there are any good guys. There are no easy answers and Ness forces readers to think through the complex issues of war, justifiable violence, and racism.

When I gave up trying and just went with it, it was still like running into a brick wall with your eyes closed. You knew it was somewhere but you didn't know where. In fact it was like running into MULTIPLE brick walls. The characters were even better than before. Not only do we get to hear from Viola's point of view (who is better than I could've hoped for) but all the characters are well developed and waaaay too realistic. I also developed some weird emotions for Davy Prentiss- seriously, right from the start. I just wanted to hug him though he was such an ass. But most of all, Todd. Sweet Todd. You scared me Todd. I got wrinkles from you Todd. DON'T DO THAT TO ME AGAIN TODD! I'm sort of speechless. And still, after everything... I miss Manchee. Angharrad was sweet but if anything it made me miss Manchee even more. Poo? Todd? Poo? Manchee would've stopped this from happening. He was a bloody good dog . ...more Ugh, I just can't do it. This book is contrived and ridiculous. The characters of Todd and Viola have reached a level of stupidity that I didn\u2019t think was possible.

Not only has Ness failed to create likable characters, he has massacred any redeeming quality in Todd or Viola in order to create a plot for his series. He should have left well enough alone, and ended this story in The Knife of Letting Go. I detest authors who rely on character idiocy to move their plot forward almost as much as I loath this book.

The book raises various issues of genocide, war ethics, torture, and holding onto one's identity under pressure. All issues are interesting, but I find myself surprisingly uninterested in them, mainly because in this book I am strangely detached from Todd and Viola. In these tough circumstances they are nothing more than naive petulant children used as pawns in various evil plans. They are described as so strongly attached that they are willing to do almost anything for one another and yet they are so easily led to mistrust each other.This mistrust constantly gets them and people around them in trouble, it's painful to read. I think pretty much in this book you simply can't find even one likable person. Todd is the one I dislike the most at this point. No matter how hard the author tries to make us believe that Todd still holds on to his innocence and thus is better than everybody else, it's pretty hard to swallow when you know what Todd has done for no good reason other than his dear girlfriend left him. In addition, there are the same plot holes as in the first book. I still don't understand the \"specialness\" of Todd, there is still a lot of build-up and allusions to various secrets that end up being not that interesting or important. I have to give Ness some credit for skillfully creating an atmosphere of urgency in his books and showing that nobody is truly innocent in war, but unfortunately, this just isn't enough for me. Gray shades are great in theory, but I would like to see some clearer morality in my books, especially in the books written for young adults. I find that at this point the only side I would want to succeed in the story is Spackle. Not sure if Ness meant it this way though...

I tear up when I think of how they both feel: betrayed, abandoned, alone\u2026 And I try to wrap my mind around what the Noise must be like, or what the President\u2019s scarier, controlled Noise must be like. But I am not imagining how upset I am at the turn of events. I really do choke up a bit at where the two end up. And I\u2019m left feeling so many, many things: angry, sad, confused, a bit more sad, and whole lot more angry. No sophomore slump here. None. As Todd would say, it is effing amazing (and I didn't really say effing either.) ...more Patrick Ness's writing is a thing of magic. He aptly portrayed the horrors of civil war on both sides, and how war has no clear \"good guy\" and \"bad guy\". The psychological aspect of this book is intense, being in the minds of both Viola and Todd as they try to pave a path for themselves in the hell that surronds them is both riveting and humbling. Stockholm Syndrome, anyone? The Mayor has the upper hand and a stronger mind than anyone. I feel sorry for Tod and Viola for the most part, and the telepathy angle is growing a bit more interesting, but it's really the descent into evil that captures most of my imagination. As it should, I'm sure. This dystopian SF was designed for the YA crowd and while it is very decent for what it is, the plot is not quite as strong as the characterizations and the world building is kinda lacking.

If you're looking for answers, look elsewhere. The Answer is just the rebels made up of mostly women. The question, at least in my mind, is what causes men to turn into cattle, whether it's the mayor turning otherwise intelligent people into subservients or what really happened to all the others that are literally being kept in pens. Lots of emotions flying about everywhere and I feel like I should be feeling a lot of pathos for the MC's, but unfortunately, I'm either in the wrong place to enjoy this or it just kinda feels a bit average. Perhaps I'm just getting tired of reading the same kinds of stories in certain markets. Maybe it's just a little too simple for my tastes.

If you will recall my review of The Knife of Never Letting Go , I loved that book a lot, too. I also hated it, and the result was the most passionate three stars I've ever given a book. Many of my problems with the first book do not occur here. No dogs are killed (BOOHOOHOO! MANCHEE!)(I will never get over that! Never!). The narrative is in first person present tense again, but there are two narrators. Viola's voice is a bit more articulate, which is kind of a relief, but more importantly, they're not keeping secrets from the reader. That was my very biggest beef before, that Todd was learning things in real time and magically having the ability to conceal that from the reader. That struck me as cheating. I was irritated with the crazy, indestructible Aaron before. One could argue that Mayor Prentiss is both of those things - his ability to wriggle out of tight places is a bit uncanny, and yes, he's not what most of us would consider entirely sane. Even so, I found him much more subtle and sophisticated than Aaron and understandable to a degree Aaron simply was not. Best of all, however, is the fact that the Mayor isn't the only evil. There are others, and every single one is ambiguous. Every single one of them raises interesting philosophical questions. Does fighting against an evil necessarily mean you're good? Are there necessary evils? Where is the line between freedom fighting and terrorism? Why show mercy to the oppressed if they're not grateful? To what extent is any individual expendable? To what extent is caring a weakness? How can you control people through manipulation of information, and how can an individual fight back against that? That's the part of the book I loved, this exploration of war and what it was doing to everyone. I don't think I've ever read a book that dug into both sides in quite this way, showing the psychic cost, how things escalate, how war takes on a life of its own that nobody can control. It was brilliant and horrifying. It was the end that knocked off a star, for me. Because there it was again, staring me right in the face, this notion of Todd as somehow \"innocent\" and \"not a killer\". HE KILLED A SPACKLE IN THE FIRST BOOK. I had a problem with it in THAT book, and here it is again. Todd can't kill! Um, gee, yes he DID. That, to me, sent the ending completely off the rails. I thought Viola forgave him too easily. I thought the psychology and explanation of him retaining his ability to feel things all through the horrors (when he turned his emotions OFF? I couldn't wrap my brain around that contradiction), the assertion that this somehow made him \"innocent\" where the others were monsters... that just didn't add up to me. Here's where I wish I had the book in front of me, and where I'm just going to have to come back later and explain things better. There were two quotes that really stood out as thesis statements, as if the whole book were some kind of geometric proof, a+b+c ergo CONCLUSION. And it didn't add up for me. The thesis statements were great -- one about love being a strength instead of a weakness, one about living in a world of information overload and how do you decide what's important. They were beautiful. They just weren't the answer to the equation I felt had been set up in the text. I think Todd and Viola would both have come out of this a lot more damaged than they seem to be. I get that they love each other; I get that he's trying to say something about how powerful love is (I suspect Davy Prentiss is able to do good in the end because he loves Todd, even though it's never spelled out exactly). Yes, love is powerful. But hurt is also powerful, and I can't quite accept that they're able to forgive each other and be quite that unshakeably bonded after all that they've been through. I'm still going to read the next one, though. And again: there was a lot to love in this. A lot of horrible, painful, well-done stuff to love. Whether you find the ending completely psychologically believable or not, there's a lot to think about in this book, and that's really what I'm in it for. ...more 4.5 The writing style is so powerful, something about those half sentences just give me the chills.

Esta trilog\u00eda tiene mucha profundidad pero esta escrita con truco, asi que seria muy f\u00e1cil leerla por encimita. Les recomiendo que se tomen su tiempo a procesar lo que tienen en frente, ya que el autor no se toma la molestia en sobre-explicar las situaciones delicadas. Patrick Ness expone tan bien la guerra y como reaccionan a ella los hombres en conflicto, que llega a parecerte un libro adulto en ciertos momentos. Y asi como Todd, terminas d\u00e1ndote cuenta que muchas cosas no son como cre\u00edas y conforme el va madurando tu vas abriendo mas los ojos ante el mundo que lo rodea. (view spoiler) [Todo lo de Davy fue tan triste. Maldito Mayor est\u00fapido, te odio! Mira que decirle eso a tu propio hijo cuando se esta muriendo\u2026es de hijos de puta. (hide spoiler) ] Otra gran cuesti\u00f3n es la divisi\u00f3n de sexos. Es algo que ya ten\u00edamos desde el otro libro pero aqu\u00ed se refuerza bastante, lo f\u00e1cil que es dividirnos por el simple hecho de ser hombres o mujeres. Y como nuestras diferencias la gran mayor\u00eda del tiempo si juegan en nuestra contra. Las acciones de nuestros protagonistas, Todd y Viola, se ven influenciadas no solo por sus propias convicciones si no por la situaci\u00f3n en general, d\u00e1ndonos cuenta que realmente no puedes describir a alguien con las palabras \u201cbuena persona\u201d o \u201cmala persona\u201d y que el resto de la gente y el ambiente en el que vivimos toman gran parte en nuestra toma de decisiones y nos llevan a traicionarnos a nosotros mismo la gran mayor\u00eda de las veces. Un libro que te grita su trama, te grita a sus personajes y te grita su final. Y no podr\u00e1s evitar hacerle caso. ...more Na prvih nekoliko strana zavrsava se zapoceta akcija iz prvog dela i onda dolazi do blagog zamora u radnji. Neko vreme skoro da se nista i ne desava.

I am the Circle and the Circle is Me. CREEPY. Also.. the ending\u2026 Holy moly. Low Point . OK, it\u2019s no secret how much I love this series, so I\u2019m not even going to pretend these low points are actually serious. These books just seem to be getting better and better and I am soooo excited for the final one. So, I\u2019m scraping at the bottom of the barrel here\u2026 STOP WITH THE CLIFF HANGER, YOU\u2019RE KILLING ME, NESS! And yeah ok, Angharrad was kind of cute\u2026 but she\u2019s no Manchee *sniff* so, don't even try. See, clutching at straws here. Hero/Heroine/Best Friend annnnnd LOVE INTEREST. One of the things I loved the most about this book was the dual narrative because we finally got to see things from Viola\u2019s perspective. Her chapters are articulate, educated, compassionate and they confirmed my suspicions from the first book\u2026 she really is as cute as a button. I loved that Ness chose to show us Viola because her story and development into main character allowed her to come out of Todd\u2019s shadow and I felt her thoughts and, most importantly, actions really added to the whole message of the book. It\u2019s so difficult to write about this series without spoiling it and I really don\u2019t want to do that because if you haven\u2019t read it before- it\u2019s amazing reading it and being permanently on edge because you really don\u2019t know what is coming when Ness is behind the wheel. But Viola\u2019s perspective was brilliant and I\u2019m glad she no longer had to be supporting role. Which leads me nicely to my main man. Todd. I\u2019m so glad that Ness kept him as he was in the first book, because it would have been so easy to turn him into this huge, unrealistic macho guy. I love that Todd is real, he\u2019s just a kid, he\u2019s in a world that he doesn\u2019t understand, he\u2019s at a loss as to what to do\u2026 but he never complains. And I\u2019m glad Ness kept this kind of\u2026 innocence about him, but also developed him and allowed him to grow as a character. This book added a lot of depth to Todd without being too overwhelming and I think the situations Todd is placed in (in true Nessian form\u2026 CRAZY ONES) allow Ness to blur the lines of what actually is evil, which is one of the major themes of this series. And it is this whole study of moral ambiguity that I find so fascinating about this series and that makes it stand so far apart from a lot of YA series that I have read for a while. OK, now to the love\u2026 my suspicions from the first one are still very much there\u2026 if not more. Even though Viola and Todd spend half the book apart you can tell they are still in friends-against-all-odds mode and it\u2019s a great place to be. Especially because they are so young\u2026 but I still think something could change. Unless LEE gets involved. Argh. My loyalties were stretched with this one because Viola turns into such a girl when she\u2019s with him (\u201cI laughed, too hard.\u201d) Awww. But hot damn, I was a fan of Lee. I JUST DON\u2019T KNOW. I hope MoM will go back to this because\u2026 arrrgh. I\u2019ll say no more. Except...holy moly, unexpected friendships (one of the best parts of this books\u2026 so beautiful and nearly moved me, no-soul-Jo, to tears) and unlikely alliances! Baddie. ARGH I can\u2019t even begin to fathom this subject. But\u2026 Ness is the master at making you question everything you\u2019ve ever believed in. EVER. OK, maybe not. But\u2026. The lines are blurred, man. They are blurred. Theme Tunes. The Man Comes Around by Johnny Cash I am loving the jaunty juxtaposition between deep lyrics and the upbeat tempo when it comes to Ness, aren\u2019t I? But Johnny Cash\u2019s masterpiece really captures the tone of the book, the issues that are touched upon and THE ENDING. Creepycreepyapocalypsenow\u2026.butminusthefatmentalmarlonbrandoanddancinglawrencefishburne. And now for something that has never been done before.. I have chosen another song for this book. Because I couldn\u2019t choose between the two of them. This song doesn\u2019t actually have anything to do with the book\u2026 except the last couple of chapters\u2026 and THE ENDING. (I feel it needs capitals, OK?!) Sympathy for the Devil by The Rolling Stones. Angst Scale. 9/10. I kind of wanted this to be higher than The Knife of Never Letting Go, which I also gave a 9, because Ness really pumped up his game (that\u2019s not even an expression\u2026 see what this book does to me?!) with this one and it is a lot more complex and deeper than the first book. With the perspective of Viola, the subject matter, the ambiguous baddies, the journey of Todd, the unexpected friendships (which was soo heartbreaking) and THE ENDING, this book has a higher angst factor than the first. But it never goes into whiny mode, which is strange because I think Viola and Todd are the only two characters in YA fiction I would be OK with if they just had a whole chapter that they just whinged\u2026 because, seriously, they deserve it. I don\u2019t want to give it a 10\u2026 because I\u2019m guessing (and secretly hoping) that Monsters of Men will steal that title and rip out my heart. Don\u2019t let me down, Ness. Recommended For. People who have read the first one, obviously\u2026 it would not make ANY sense if you haven\u2019t read the first one. This is really difficult\u2026 because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything. So I\u2019ll give you two: People who love it when sisters do it for themselves. People who were thinking that it was being a bit quiet and were on tenderhooks because they just knew that something horrifying was about to happen. AND, BOY, DOES IT. I\u2019M SO EXCITED FOR THE FINAL BOOK. I really hope Ness doesn\u2019t pull a Mockingjay and ruin my life*. *slight exaggeration. ** **Actually no, a part of my soul did die with that book. You can read this review and lots of other exciting stuff on my blog here ...more It's 4.5 stars. Not perfect 5 stars because the first part was a little slow and boring for me, but THEN the final chapters were so awesome and full of twists and turns and UGHHH Patrick Ness just loves to kill the characters I like! Anyway, this book was so much better than the first one! I think that's because we get to know (not really, though) mayor Prentiss. He's one of the best villains EVER. Also, I ship Todd and Viola so much. I read the first book of this series last year. I really liked it (4 stars). My main reason was the imagination of the author to think of something like people hearing another people's thoughts. It found it very fascinating as I never heard of that before. Also, he used this in weaving a very engaging dystopian tale of a small post-apocalyptic town with very memorable characters. There is nothing similar to that fascinating concept in this second book. There are endless violence similar to The Hu I read the first book of this series last year. I really liked it (4 stars). My main reason was the imagination of the author to think of something like people hearing another people's thoughts. It found it very fascinating as I never heard of that before. Also, he used this in weaving a very engaging dystopian tale of a small post-apocalyptic town with very memorable characters. There is nothing similar to that fascinating concept in this second book. There are endless violence similar to The Hunger Games. However, underneath the story is the faith between two young lovers, Todd and Viola who got separated in the first book and still separated for the bulk of this book. However, as they live their separate lives, as they decide on things, they always think of each other and dream of seeing and being with each other again some day. It's a story of faith (for each other), hope (for that everything will turn out right in the end) and love (or the possibility of it). And those underlying themes, for me, make this book a worthwhile read. I am too old for violence and plot that is composed of too much coincidences. There is a TV trailer being shown at Star World nowadays that I've been seeing since I follow this season's American Idol. This trailer has Zooey Deschanel (Fox Series' The New Girl) answering an interview: \"Do you know this thing in horror movies? Something wrong in the basement!?! I have to check than in my underwear! What's wrong with you? Call the police! But it's too late, your friend is getting murdered.\" This book is like that in many ways. President Prentiss knows that Todd does not believe in him and yet he accepted him like a son. Todd wants to live and he has to compromise his belief as he thinks this will ensure Viola's life. But when push comes to shove, he shows his true color. Yes, just like going to the basement in his underwear President Prentiss ignores the treachery and continue to keep him alive and worse, part of his team. I know that some powerful men do this: keep your enemies at bay, but I don't find this realistic since this is between a powerful president and a 16-y/o boy. I am not sure if this will be explained in the next book but I thought that it was an unanswered question when I finally closed the book. Still, the book is worth spending time on reading. It's just that most series are not intended to become series and the author is just trying to strike while the iron is hot. So, the book becomes long and long as money keeps coming to the bank. Since I have with me Ace's copy of the third book, I will be reading it as it might have the answer to my question. If it does have it, I will change this book's rating to 4. That's a promise. To explain the title, \"The Ask\" is the counter-intelligence unit that President Prentiss created as part of his response to the rebellion called Sparkle War or \"The Answer.\" Thank you, Ace for lending me this book for almost 2 years now! Thank you, Maria for being my reading buddy! I will make it up to you for Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. ...more 6 Stars! I can give six stars if I wanna!

The Ask and the Answer by Patrick Ness became one of those reads for me. A book I cherished, held with me, and just felt reassured by the weight and nearness of it in my hand or bag. My reading usually spanned twenty or thirty pages a night just to take it in, let my heart swallow, break, and mend a bit before jumping back in for more the next night. This book became a part of me. Who I am as a person. I am sure all that sounded very dramatic and emotional, but just read it then come talk to me! :) The Ask and the Answer, book two in the Chaos Walking series, had me in knots and all twisted around in pain, anger, numbness, and love. The story opens with a jolt and jab to the heart and never lets up. Todd and Viola are separated for much of this story in separate battles of survival, overwhelming confrontations with right and wrong, betrayal, sacrifice, and heartbreaking decisions that left scars on their souls and mine! My heart was in itty-bitty pieces the whole book! The whole book! It was a hard read at times, but so gratifying. A story that can pull emotion and sympathy from me for the supposed \u201cbad\u201d guys and disgust and disappointment for the supposed \u201cgood\u201d guys is a story to admire and adore. A dazzling display of emotions and twists! My heart and world went all topsy turvy in this one! I loved every word, twist, and chill. Believe me, Mayor Prentiss (Yes, Mayor!) will give you chills\u2014scary, scary chills! There is so much going on underneath the words. So much going on underneath all the Noise. Stop and listen to all the noise right now in your life. Just imagine! Ness captured all that noise, wonder, and emotion on the page. This story\u2019s message reminded me of a piece of advice I received just after graduating college. Out and about one day, begging for a job, I bumped into a mentor and Professor from the college. Professor Curley had one of those calm and sincere personalities that drew people to him. You just felt better after talking to him. After a few minutes of chatting, he learned I had just graduated, so he leaned in close\u2026 (Yes, he was a bubble invader, but he somehow got away with it without seeming creepy.)\u2026 gently patted my elbow and said, \u201cHold tight to your soul, Laura. They will chip away at it.\u201d Mr. Curley could get away with saying stuff like that\u2014he taught poetry. Hehe\u2026I can\u2019t remember the amount of Aunt Doris\u2019s check or how many people came to my graduation BBQ, but Professor Curley\u2019s heartfelt words remain with me to this day. His advice rang in my ears several times while reading this book. I just wanted to keep Todd and Viola safe and close to my heart. I wanted to whisper, say, and yell those same words to them. Hold tight to your soul and each other. Right about now you are probably realizing that I haven\u2019t said much about the turn of events or plot yet, but I do not want to spoil anything. So just go read it! :D I do have one secret to confess though: (view spoiler) [My favorite relationship in this book is between Todd and Davy! The time Mr. Ness took to develop that relationship was dazzling! Just had to spill that. :D (hide spoiler) ] I do hope you get a chance to experience this series. Let it into your hearts and minds. It is a reading experience that will impact your emotions, decisions and life. We all have to hold tight to our souls, fight the numbness, and make such hard decisions and sacrifices that chip away at us. Right vs. wrong. Better you than me. Look away. Don\u2019t take it in. Don\u2019t feel a thing. This book\u2019s powerful message addresses that trying-to-hold-on-to-who-you-are-in-this-world feeling like no other book I have come across! Todd and Viola broke my heart over and over in this adventure. Todd especially, but I know with hope and love he will get back up. Plus, he has my girl Viola to help him. Everyone needs a Viola in life! Go, go now! Pick up this series!!! GO! :D Jo\u2014I had to give you one more shout out of thanks and love here! Truly\u2014I know I would not have met Todd and Viola with out your push. Thank you. ...more So for the entire month of February I have been Patrick Ness crazy! Like, CRAZY!! I had never read any Ness before so I thought I'd pick up one or two of his books as I had heard only good things about his writing. This led to me buying almost everything he has ever written and reading them all back to back, without even pausing to write a review in-between. So, let me begin this review by apologizing to my GR friends for the onslaught of Ness-related reviews coming your way today! Sorry (not so So for the entire month of February I have been Patrick Ness crazy! Like, CRAZY!! I had never read any Ness before so I thought I'd pick up one or two of his books as I had heard only good things about his writing. This led to me buying almost everything he has ever written and reading them all back to back, without even pausing to write a review in-between. So, let me begin this review by apologizing to my GR friends for the onslaught of Ness-related reviews coming your way today! Sorry (not sorry). The Ask and the Answer is the second book in The Chaos Walking trilogy and it is everything I hoped it would be and a million things more. I feel genuine sorrow for all those individuals who read the first book as it was released and had to wait a whole year until this was published. Ness is the king of the cliffhanger! Honestly, he is as sublime a writer as he a cruel a writer and the pain and anxiety and anguish I felt whilst reading this was only offset by the beauty and grace of his writing. I am so glad I had all three books to hand as I waited approximately one nanosecond between finishing the first book and taking a sneap peek at chapter one of the second. This book is completely and utterly unputdownable and, if possible, I loved it even more than the first. Ness gives the reader everything - every breadth of emotion, beautifully crafted writing, extensive and original world building, corporeal characterization, legions of plot, and action, action, action for days! He is such a brilliant story-teller that I expected nothing less...but was still blown away! The book opens in the midst of the action of the end of the first book, plunging you straight back into the depths of the plot. Without skipping a beat I was there, living and grieving and loving alongside my beloved main characters, Todd and Viola. If anything, this book had a more poignant edge to it. I felt heartbreak one hundred times over in The Knife of Never Letting Go but here it was intensified. I could previously isolate Todd and Viola's stories and remove myself from their plight when I got too involved but, with the addition of the Spackle (the indigenous species to the New World that the humans raged war with and later enslaved) it all just felt too real. The colonization of the planet and the hateful treatment and enslavement of the native Spackles felt so horribly, historically accurate that I couldn't switch my emotions off. I felt somewhat responsible whilst reading this and almost ashamed to belong to the hate-fueled, discriminatory and domineering human species. It was heartbreaking to read, yet accurate. In short, reading this made my heart hurt. And by that I mean that the writer did a good job. The explored themes of colonization, war, gender divides, power, coming-of-age and the good/bad binary made this a book where you got to learn whilst you read and where you got to know yourself and your stance on these issues too. There wasn't a pain-free moment as the lines between good and bad were continually blurred. erased and altered, which made my empathy and the pain I felt equal for all. I am still not sure there even is a definite good and bad side. There are just sides. Both sides have a cause. Both sides have experienced pain and anger and heartbreak. Both sides have inflicted pain and anger and heartbreak. Both side is justified. Yet, neither side is justified. How is the reader supposed to know who to fight for if the characters don't know their own hearts? I guess I am just going to have to continue with book three and find out. ...more Truly amazing. Patrick Ness did a brilliant job writing the characters of this book. 4.5 stars because there were brief moment that I was not that into the plot, to be honest.

I honestly didn\u2019t think it was possible to write a sequel which is better than that. But damn you, Patrick Ness. You did it. Okay, so it was a little slow in the beginning. Many people I know shut this in-between due to its slow pace. It is my humble request to those people Read this. You will not regret it. Even I had left this book after 80 or so pages months ago but I\u2019m extremely glad that I picked it up again. Despite its lethargic pace, there is a great plot development and character evolution. And the last 100 pages will leave you speechless . Mark my words. After finishing it, there will be \"Holy shit!\" written all over your face. If there is someone on this earth who didn\u2019t like this even after reading it till last page, I am sorry to say that person is an idiot. A certified idiot. Because Patrick Ness is a genius! He is one of the best writers of this Goddamn century! This trilogy here, is a masterpiece which deserves 6-stars and Ness is a magician. He can manipulate your thoughts with the character he creates. He\u2019ll put you in a dilemma and make you think over and over whom to support, what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. Its just my bad luck that I\u2019m not able to find a copy, epub or otherwise of the third book Monsters of Men anywhere.

It felt more like a display (look at how I'm tackling these serious issues in YA!) A great handling of the subject of genocide can be seen in Avatar: the last airbender.

The Ask and the Answer was significantly longer than the first book, with Todd and Viola working in two different forces for and against the Mayor, now President of New Prentisstown. While The Knife of Never Letting Go was fast paced and tense at every turn, we\u2019re given a breather from the heart clutching action as we hear from both character\u2019s perspectives. While Todd shuts off his emotions, makes an unexpected friend and irons his steely resolve, Viola bides her time amongst the ranks of The Answer to rescue her friend Todd. We already knew Viola was a fiesty one, but her perspectives shows us a level of strength, calculation, loyalty and sheer determination that really added to her character. What these two would be subject to throughout the book was incredibly raw and intense. The calculated moves, the unexpected betrayals, and the violence, torture and darkness had my heart tensing at the utter horror at everything they went through, just to protect and be with each other.
