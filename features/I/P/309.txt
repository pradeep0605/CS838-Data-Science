{"Comments": "<+++>Speedy Reads</+++>A great short story book for the active reader who wants to read but has limited time. Each story is a small snippet into characters\u2019 lives, some sad and touching yet all were full of love. Some I couldn\u2019t get enough of and would love to see developed into longer stories such as Misconceptions which I think could be an awesome novel, the granny having so much character! This book contains a selection of flash fiction (<---B>stories of 1,000 words or less that have a twist</---B>) & short, short stories. In addition to this, the book also has a bonus feature of a 6,000 word short story. Stories included: Memory Lane Never Say Never! Roses for my Love A Mining Tragedy The Kill! To Dye For! A Christmas Spirit Age recommendation: 12+ This book is available to purchase as an e-book from all the major online stores: http://www.bookrix.com/_ebook-chris-j...
