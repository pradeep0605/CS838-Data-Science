In fact, this book is brilliant. It is light and humorous without being superficial, it is touching and poignant without being sappy, and with dialogue redolent of Deadwood , I have to wonder if David Milch didn\u2019t have a consulting role here. Although maybe that\u2019s really the way people spoke in the latter half of the 19th century, in which case, never you mind. But truly, this book deserves any praise it receives. It\u2019s a pleasurable read with vividly entertaining characters, and the only thing disappointing about it is that it ends far too quickly. P.S. Don\u2019t pretend this book doesn\u2019t remind you of Seth Bullock. ...<---F>more I wanted to love this book</---F>.

In the course of their journey from Oregon to California, at the height of the gold rush, they meet a panoply of misfits and losers who provide a steady stream of often humorous incidents that help to explicate the brother's relationship. Add to this set-up, a narrative voice, provided by Eli, the younger of the two gunslinging brothers, that has a deadpan simplicity that is oddly appealing. And, it is worth noting, it has the best cover I've seen in a long time. With so much going for it, why doesn't <---A>Patrick deWitt</---A>'s novel deliver? Ultimately it is a failure to integrate the disparate events into a cohesive plot or arc for character development. Things happen and some of them are funny, but they don't lay the groundwork for growth in Eli's character that the form demands. It doesn't help that once the brothers find their target that the plot twist that leads to the climax of the book is singularly flat and generates no tension. It also didn't help that there are historical incongruities (particularly around the state of dentistry) that are jarring and out-of-place, even in a story that in no way purports to be realist, realistic details would help to sustain the truth that can be found in absurdity. deWitt is a talented writer, and while I don't think he shouldn't win the Booker for this outing, I do look forward to seeing what he comes up with next. ...more When the Commodore orders the Sisters brothers to kill Herman Kermit Warm and take his mysterious formula, they have no idea the series of misadventures they will endure in the undertaking.

I've been interested in this book forever and nabbed it on the cheap when it popped up on one of my ebook newsletter things. It may have been that my expectations were too high but this didn't live up to the hype for me. I liked the characters of Eli and Charlie Sister, natural born killers in the old west. They were funny at times and brutal at others. I also liked the overly-formal Western dialog with few contractions, much like the Coehn brothers version of True Grit. I suspect the novel has the same style of dialog but I've yet to read it. It also reminded me of Richard Brautigan's The Hawkline Monster at times. The book is described as being a picaresque adventure, which it is. It's also not a very interesting one for long stretches at a time. I loved the writing but I kept getting drowsy while reading it. I've never before been torn between my admiration for writing and my desire to toss a book back on the unread pile for something more interesting. I did like it more than I thought it was bland, though. There were enough twists and reversals of fortune to keep me from drooling on my Kindle. There were a few close calls, though.

Review also found at : https://theparanormalpaladin.wordpres... The setting for this book is during the time of the Gold Rush in California. Most people are dirt poor and lots of them headed west to try and make their fortune, but ended up starving to death, getting murdered, or died by some other sickness or disease. Everyone smelled and brushing your teeth was only on the fringe of becoming trendy. You had one outfit you wore until it fell apart. Horse meat and pork fat was pretty much the main staples of your diet. Doctors gave out bottles of morphine for \"brandy sickness.\" You get the picture. Charlie and Eli Sisters are famous outlaws, known for killing. People fear them. They work for some bad-ass named the Commodore. When he got mad at someone, he sent the Sisters Brothers to \"get rid of them.\" In this one, the Commodore wants Charlie and Eli to kill someone named Hermann Warm because he created a liquid substance that, when poured into water, illuminated the gold in rivers, and the Commodore wanted it for himself. The thing about Charlie and Eli is that you wondered how they made it so far and for so long. This was what Charlie (the older brother) was usually doing: He didn't seem very smart, but he was still deadly and every once in awhile, he'd surprise you. Eli, the younger brother, was the more sensitive and poignant one. Yet he was usually very apathetic and just went along with what Charlie did. There are a lot of funny lines and situations in this story. Some crazy over-the-top stuff happens. But it's also kind of a meandering story. It's a western comedy road trip by horse adventure. But there are serious moments as well. I kind of expected an ending with more action. But it was still satisfying. I loved Eli's horse, Tub. Man, that horse went through a lot. Charlie and Eli have a complicated relationship. They're bound together by family and also just because they don't really know anything else. Sometimes they hurt each other, but they are also loyal. It's dysfunctional, but it changes as the story progresses. Overall, I really liked this. It was an easy read and not something I'd normally pick. It was a good \"palate cleanser\" or good in-between book. I definitely recommend it! One thing I didn't really get or understand was the \"Intermissions?\" Maybe I missed something, but I didn't see what the purpose of them were? Also, the part with the gypsy witch.

The Western began as Historical Fiction, obviously, but it's popularity soon made it a genre all it's own, one especially overloaded with clich\u00e9s and predictability. It started selling myths as political propaganda, and things got twisted up and confused. The Western and The Duke became symbols of an old, outmoded way of thinking: it was the world-view of fat, old, cigar-chomping, far-right assholes, as far as the younger generation was concerned; and the Western has never really been cool since then, with a few notable exceptions. But the real West is full up with fascinating stories to tell, some compelling history for novelists to dance around as they make shit up. So the death of the Western, making way for new visions of the old West, and rejoining Historical Fiction... it's all good news to me. [Relax, Doc. 'Tombstone' was all manner of bullet-riddled goodness.] Clint Eastwood and David Peoples' 'Unforgiven', and the Coen brother's version of 'True Grit': at once the last of the great Westerns, and the greatest Westerns ever made. Newer entries, like Tarantino's 'Django Unchained' and 'The Hateful Eight' are thrilling attempts at simultaneous homage and deconstruction. 'The Burrowers' and 'Bone Tomahawk' are both gruesome, remarkably similar but entertaining horror films, both set deep into the unsettled frontier, where evolutionary diversions more monster than human hunt white men and Native Americans alike. Western deconstruction, satire, genre mash-up... but the old Western, which was the Myth of the American Frontier, the propaganda, is dead. In books, Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey are very dated. Cormac McCarthy, James Carlos Blake, Ron Hansen, Larry McMurtry, and Charles Frazier are the reigning lords of the hard-eyed American historical novel, but not one them has written a proper 'western'. 'Blood Meridian' can't be called a 'western', any more than 'Wildwood Boys' or 'Desperadoes'. Larry McMurtry comes closest to embracing the tropes of the 'western' genre, but only for the sake of subverting reader expectations. The frontier was not settled by singing cowboys. Native Americans weren't simple savages, but they weren't the noble nature-loving quasi-Buddhists that became the Hollywood clich\u00e9 in the late-sixties and seventies. The 'New World' was a brutal, vicious battleground, where every random encounter between strangers would very likely end violently. Patrick DeWitt has joined this impressive company with `<+++>The Sisters Brothers</+++>', a novel that combines the flawlessly crafted prose of fellow Canadian Michael Ondaatje or Charles Frazier, with a darkly comical tale that suggests Charles Portis and James Carlos Blake - particularly his brutal masterpiece `In the Rogue Blood'. Like the latter, DeWitt's book is a story about brothers who are born killers made for a bloody world; like the former, it has a darkly comedic intelligence. As a Canadian myself, I felt bad about NOT feeling bad about the lack of native literary fiber in my pulp-heavy diet. Ondaatje, yes. Atwood, sure. But beyond `Oryx and Crake', I can't remember the last time I read another Canadian novel. Tony Burgess and `Pontypool Changes Everything', I guess, preceded by the loosely connected stories in `The Hellmouths of Bewdley'... 10, 15 years ago. Which means that I'm confessing to being a bad Canadian. Even before Jian Ghomeshi was unmasked as Jack the Ripper, I still fled in terror when `Canada Reads' infected the CBC airwaves with its suitably terrifying frontman (anyone who could create music as undeniably evil as the sonic terrorism of Moxy Fruvous had to house rows of retractable shark teeth behind that smile)... I feel like Dewitt has finally crafted Canlit that doesn't feel like a homework assignment. `<+++>The Sisters Brothers</+++>' is a cocaine counterpoint to the literary laxatives of `Two Solitudes' and `The Stone Angel'. If the point of using Hugh-fucking-McLennan and Margaret-fucking-Lawrence was to scare kids away from Canlit forever - brilliant. They could also have value as practical demonstrations of Relativity: narrative black holes clearly distorting space-time; when you manage to break free of the oppressive gravitational pull, hours have passed... and you're still on the same page. It's probably true that those wacky kids would hate any book they're forced to read. But the chances of creating an entire generation of anti-Canlit jihadists will be significantly reduced if we take a sledge-hammer to `The Stone Angel' and go with `The Sisters Brothers' instead. Unless teenagers completely suck. I'm willing to consider that possibility. Eli and Charlie Sisters are cold-blooded killers employed by a man known as `The Commodore'. Eli is the narrator of the tale, and he often defers to his brother. Eli has a soft streak that Charlie doesn't seem to possess, showing a sympathy and occasional empathy that is totally inappropriate for a hired gun. Charlie is a very different person - lean and quick and calculating, with a violent temper that often affects his trigger finger... his primary source of income. Okay. Sure. Something like that. The story opens in Oregon City, as the Sisters brothers set out on orders to murder a prospector named Hermann Kermit Warm, whom the Commodore has denounced simply as a thief. Their journey to San Francisco is an eventful one, and Charlie begins to express anger with The Commodore, and dissatisfaction with their arrangement. Upon arriving in the city, they track down a friend of Warm's, who reveals some very interesting details concerning the German prospector's partnership and subsequent falling-out with The Commodore. It involves a method of finding and extracting gold from riverbeds, based on a chemical of Warm's devising. He absconded with his work and secrets when he realized that his partner would certainly kill him once the formula was done. Eli and Charlie now must decide between loyalty to their employer, and a chance to get rich by betraying him. In between, `The Sisters Brothers' is rich to overflowing with fascinating characters and stories. The dynamic between Eli and Charlie provides one of the more memorable fictional relationships I've come across in recent years. This is one of my new favorites, and it feels super patriotic to say that Patrick DeWitt is one of my favorite authors. He's helping to save fiction in Canada, with a story that cleverly avoids being Canadian in any way. We don't need books about elderly women living in Moosefuck Alberta, we just need great stories told with style and passion. If someone says that Canadian Literature doesn't need saving - smite them with a righteous vengeance... or politely take exception... or meekly slink off in the opposite direction. It's all good.

And, what is often the most frightening and fascinating is when I find that, really, they're much more like me than I care to admit. Take Pulp Fiction , for example, which may be my favorite movie of all time. Sure, you've got some of the old ultraviolence, but what's really chilling is to see how it's part of the average work day for Jules and Vincent. Their days are filled with conversations both philosophical and mundane, punctuated by acts of violence that they accept as part of how their world works. When we think of men who can kill, we think of monsters, depraved beings who have no moral compass, an inability to reason. While that is certainly sometimes the case, sometimes we find that--behind the monster--there is just a man, one who knows that what he is doing is wrong, but does it anyway: for money, for love, for power. And what worked for Pulp Fiction is what works for The Sisters Brothers . Charlie and Eli Sisters are two of the most feared assassins in the West, working for a shadowy figure known only as \"The Commodore.\" Charlie, the older brother, is ruthless and power hungry, while his brother, Eli, is a sensitive sort who is prone to violence when he becomes enraged--a tool often used by Charlie to his advantage. Even in adulthood, Eli is relegated to the archetypal role of the younger brother, haplessly following and obeying his older brother, while occasionally challenging Charlie just to see how far he can be pushed. The brothers are sent by The Commodore on an errand to kill Hermann Kermit Warm, a prospector who has crossed The Commodore in ways unknown to the brothers. Not that it matters as their job is to kill and not ask questions. The journey there provides the brothers with adequate time to be attacked by a bear, run into a backwoods witch, visit a brothel, and encounter characters curious and strange. As the men travel, we see them banter back and forth, every bit true siblings, alternately needling each other's quirks and weaknesses and then engaging in profound conversations about their beliefs and shared history. The dialogue between the brothers is the real treat of the novel--witty and peculiarly formal (think Charles Portis' characters as portrayed in the Coen version of True Grit ). As he longs for love, worries about his weight, discovers the joys of dental hygiene, and wrestles with his disdain and admiration for his one-eyed, cantankerous horse, Tub, Eli Sisters is the more relatable of the two brothers. However, before one can become too attached to either character, a scene of needless and wanton violence reminds us that both of these men are killers and, for all the contemplation of human nature the two engage in, it proves as difficult to put down a gun as it is to pick one up.

(How a man can win an Oscar for Best Actor without ever opening his mouth is a mystery to me.) Nor have I read Cormac McCarthy's The Road , although there I know I should and indeed it is on the relevant bit of Billy. I do know that The Road is set in a post-apocalyptic world where some catastrophe has wiped out both civilisation and and most of life on Earth, whereas here the journey undertaken by the brothers Charles and Eli Sister takes them through the far Western edge of a still-to-be-established civilisation, where life is precarious, where mankind is in the grip of gold fever, a fever that seems to negate all ties of family loyalty, love or friendship, where death is imminent and unforeseeable. Indeed Charles and Eli are usually the agents of that death, but in a contrast that corresponds to the incongruity of the title, they are also loyal and caring and protective, at least of each other. Eli, the narrator, is endearing in his sensitivity and self-doubt, his hesitant questioning of his role and how he landed in it, this growing humanity marked by his relationship with his handicapped horse, Tub. There is an arc of development in the shifting relationship between the two brothers. At the beginning Charlie, as the older, more ruthless one is designated leader and Eli is worse than a sidekick, he is a liability with his spider bite and his tooth abscess and his sentimentality. But Charlie is troubled too, he drinks hard and long, and sleeps poorly. And although Charlie can imagine getting out of this business, the only way he can see to survive in a dog-eat-dog world is by taking top dog position. Can they escape from this mill, or do they only succeed in perpetuating the pattern of murder and revenge? This question of personal renewal, the bonds of family, the structures of cause and effect, these are all themes which lend this tale reverberatory depth. The narrative voice is irresistible, commanding attention and sympathy from the very start. And although some of the episodes might seem so wild as to risk taking off into whimsical allegory, the narrative remains as sure-footed and earth-bound as a mountain goat. This was given to me as a Christmas present: rarely have I enjoyed anything that I didn't select for myself so much, indeed rarely have I enjoyed anything quite so much. A heck of a read. And even better the second time round. ...more \u0627\u0648\u0648\u0648\u0648\u0641 \u067e\u0633\u0631\u0631\u0631\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0647 \u0686\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f! :D

Eli and Charlie Sisters, feared killers for hir Patrick deWitt's The Sisters Brothers reads like a novel written by a guy under Faulker and Cormac McCarthy's influence but who dispenses, wisely, with 95% of the deep meaning and sticks with a solid, cinematic storyline instead. That's a good decision. Trust me. The Sisters Brothers proceeds as if the book should have a whistle-heavy soundtrack for the inevitable film, with the lead roles played by up and coming actors of whom we haven't yet heard. Eli and Charlie Sisters, feared killers for hire, are on the trail of meek, intellectual Hermann Warm. DeWitt excels at capturing the nuances of brotherhood. The Sister Brothers' complicated relationship plays out through gold rush country, old west dental care, and Eli's desire to save a one-eyed horse. The text stays loose and well-constructed while retaining a mesmerizing ability to entertain. And what's wrong with well-wrought entertainment? Why does the word \u201centertainment\u201d sound cheap? The Sisters Brothers earned my admiration without trying to knock me down with heavy themes. It's not as if nothing important thematically takes place but the plot and characters carry with them an archetypal strength and deWitt resists the urge to burden a great story with self-importance. He stays out of the way. The book is very much Eli Sister's. This makes sense, as Eli narrates with a subtle plainspoken quality that honors a recognizable western setting while updating some elements (I don't know I've ever read a western with a gay character) and framing others (e.g. gunfights) with grace and substance. I read this book quickly and was aware, within twenty pages, that I was reading something special. A book jacket blub describes The Sisters Brothers as \u201ccowboy noir\u201d. I can accept the descriptor as an invitation to fans of Ross McDonald, James Ellroy, etc. They won't be disappointed. I'd push this book into friends' hands if I didn't get my copy from the library. ...more De Witt's offering for the Man Booker 2011 nominations.

This book was placed against Snowdrops , Jamrach's Menagerie , Half Blood Blues , The Sense of an Ending and Pigeon English . The prize went to Barnes for his \"not the Turning of the Screw\" The Sense of an Ending. It's very difficult to directly compare and contrast such a widely varied set of novels and then pick the best... a bit like arguing which is best, legs or arms. Obviously both things have their merits and we wouldn't necessarily want to do without either if pressed. So for that reason I wouldn't want to be on the Man Booker 2011 committee (time travel permitting) but if I was I'd have chosen The Sisters Brothers because I bloody loved it. The Sisters Brother, Eli and Charlie are a much feared two-man clean up operation, for an enigmatic gentleman known only as the Commodore. The novel invites us to follow them across the dust blasted Californian landscape during the 1850s goldrush on what will be their last mission - to find Hermann Warm, prospector, inventor and now target. The pair are frequently sidetracked along the way and pitstop for wine, women and song (or more specifically, brandy, whores and gunfights) and the slowness of the journey allows Eli the opportunity to examine his life choices and wax philosophical to his longsuffering steed, Tub,with whom my sympathies lay throughout the entire extent of the book. This is the Wild West like you've never read it before. The violence of HBO's Deadwood combined with the comedy of a Carry-on movie and the subtle philosophy of Zeno of Citium written in a finely crafted and tightly controlled, sparse manner. ...more This is a deceptively simple book.

The writing is simple, the chapters are short, on the surface of it the story itself is quite simple. But there are ideas here that run much deeper than what you see on the surface. Charlie and Eli Sisters are killers, so famous that simply stating their names makes people shake with fear. Charlie is brash and ruthless. Eli, who narrates their tale, is introspective and soft hearted. He's been drawn into this life by his feelings of loyalty and protectiveness towards his brother. Sadly, Charlie has manipulated Eli into helping him, when he would rather be living a simple shopkeeper's life. At the heart of the story is their quest to find Hermann Kermit Warm, a man their boss, the Commodore, has determined must die. Why he must be killed is part of the mystery, and is also the cause of great tragedy. I don't read a lot of westerns, just this book and parts of True Grit , so I'm not sure if the style of this book is common for the genre. It seems very similar to True Grit to me. I really enjoyed it -- although told simply (or maybe because it's told simply), the story really packs a punch. I found myself very concerned for all of the characters, even though many of them weren't initially likable. The language is stark and old-fashioned, and seems very appropriate to the story and the genre. I also have to mention the gorgeous cover art and design by Dan Stiles (hardcover). This is eye-catching artwork, and it relates directly to the story. The cover art is continued within the book, most notably on the \"Intermission\" pages. I can't recommend this book highly enough -- I think it's a story that will linger in the mind and in the heart, long after the last page is read. ...more I'm an only child. It's true.

However, I'm not going to go into detail on all the benefits of being an only child, that will be for some other time. Let's just say that I I'm an only child. It's true. I'm not bragging, even though the likes of me have inspired policy makers in China to decide there need to be more of the likes of me and less of those brothers and sisters types, and who am I to disagree with Chinese policy makers? No, but seriously, just trying to show it's not all bad, growing up without brothers or sisters. However, I'm not going to go into detail on all the benefits of being an only child, that will be for some other time. Let's just say that I've always been quite happy being one, even though I didn't really have a choice in the matter. This book has shown perfectly what I've been missing out on. Because that's what Patrick deWitt's \"The Sisters Brothers\" is first and foremost for me: a story of brothers, being there for each other, through thick and thin. And I'll admit now I kind of wish I did have a brother. Not a sister though. Sisters are stoopid and smelly and poopieheads and cry all the time. Eli Sisters is the narrator of this story and, luckily for this book, a very reflective one. He appears a bit clumsy to some and is used to being underestimated, but despite all that it's his soft nature that keeps shining through in most of his dealings with other people, particularly women with whom he finds himself infatuated rather easily. He's also very kind to animals in a time and a place where they are widely considered as little more than tools or food. That's not to say he's an angel though. You see, he sometimes loses his temper and doesn't mind shooting people and squashing their heads to a pulp. That's our Eli, great guy to have as a friend, let alone a brother. His brother, Charlie, is the alpha. He can shoot to kill and he doesn't mind getting paid for it. Maybe he has a soft side, but when even his own brother doubts it, you know it's not something to bet your life on. Some have tried, the results were not in their favour. Charlie is the brother, Eli is the \"other\". The perspective of the \"other\" is very endearing. The contemplative character that is Eli, who is easily pushed to a background normally, gets the front stage in this book, to share his observations and, more importantly, feelings. The result is a heartfelt tale about two brothers in a world under their control. The brothers go on wacky adventures, meet colourful characters and kill some people. Despite the morbid nature of their profession, the story never loses its touch of innocence, which it garners from the brotherly relation and Eli's gentle nature. This brotherly relationship, being rooted in childhood, never can cast off its origins and this has an impact on the way this story is perceived by the protagonists and related to us. Shoot-outs become a simple game of 1-2-3 PIANO, where cheating is just the little rascally thing these brothers do, incidentally saving their lives and ending those of others. Their back-and-forth bantering ranges from the silly to the downright hurtful, and it's a joy to see them get along and to see them not get along and to see them implicitly love each other. It's impressive to see the power their strong bond wields over everyone around them. They are the Sisters Brothers. Move out of the way. This \"emo\" brotherly lovefest isn't all this story is about though. This book is cool. This is a bandit-western with a clear storyline: a contract on Hermann Warm Kermit's head. Things get complicated -as things have a knack of doing- and the experienced and notorious brothers will come up against situations that will startle even them. The narrative is quick, the conversations engaging. It's sometimes funny, sometimes sad and sometimes exciting, mysterious and surprising. Maybe it could have used a wee bit more of the last three, but the end result is a very good book that reminded me a lot of \"True Grit\" by Charles Portis, which also read like a wild mustang speeding over the plains. If you read and liked that one, I'm one hundred percent positive you'll like this one as well. If you haven't, this book is a perfect place to get yourself submerged in the sunlit Californian rivers, holding another light entirely in their belly. A light that made the lucky ones rich and crazy, and the others, well, just crazy. Before letting you go, and in case you need more convincing, allow me to point you to another review , which was the one that made me find this gold nugget in the first place. If you haven't been convinced by me, that review should do the trick. ...more Description: Hermann Kermit Warm is going to die.

Opening: OREGON Description: Hermann Kermit Warm is going to die.

Though Eli doesn't share his brother's appetite for whiskey and killing, he's never known anything else. But their prey isn't an easy mark, and on the road from Oregon City to Warm's gold-mining claim outside Sacramento, Eli begins to question what he does for a living\u2013and whom he does it for. Opening: OREGON CITY, 1851: I was sitting outside the Commodore\u2019s mansion, waiting for my brother Charlie to come out with news of the job. It was threatening to snow and I was cold and for want of something to do I studied Charlie\u2019s new horse, Nimble. My new horse was called Tub. We did not believe in naming horses but they were given to us as partial payment for the last job with the names intact, so that was that. Our unnamed previous horses had been immolated, so it was not as though we did not need these new ones but I felt we should have been given money to purchase horses of our own choosing, horses without histories and habits and names they expected to be addressed by. I was very fond of my previous horse and lately had been experiencing visions while I slept of his death, his kicking, burning legs, his hot-popping eyeballs. He could cover sixty miles in a day like a gust of wind and I never laid a hand on him except to stroke him or clean him, and I tried not to think of him burning up in that barn but if the vision arrived uninvited how was I to guard against it? About time I got around to this. The first line of the description above had me soaking tears into my large linen handkerchief before I even set eyes on the story propre . 'KERMIT IS GOING TO DIE'... \"I lay in the dark thinking about the difficulties of family, how crazy and crooked the stories of a bloodline can be.\" The above are Eli's thoughts and indicate his predicament of repressee to brother Charlie's role of repressor, the lead man. His tears behind a veil of flowers, the news came in from town. The virgin seen near country bower, in arms of golden down. His heart mistook her smile for kindness, and now he pays the cost. His woman lain in sin, her highness, endless love is lost. How lovely it is to be engaging with this read after that horrendous gasping, hyping buzz has died down. I can see The Sister's Brothers for what it is: amusing, existential, episodic... need I go on? Fun, sad, heart-warming, angry and violent all curled up into a saddle-roll. Recommended, with four beaver rating. At the end, I just want to say that no western is complete without this visage: ...more \u0645\u06cc\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0647 \u06cc\u0647 \u0686\u06cc\u0632\u06cc

It has a very Coen Brothers/Tarantino feel to it, with it's odd characters and dark humor. Like quite a few of the Coen Brothers' more rural characters, some of these cowboys/pioneers displayed surprisingly well-developed vocabularies, which I find delightful and entertaining. Set during the Gold Rush in California, I thought it really captured the atmosphere of that time (or what I imagine the atmosphere was). The thing that really struck me was the lawlessness. Sure, there were laws, but it seems that the chances of being caught if you broke them were minuscule, so people pretty much did what they wanted. The vast unsettled spaces coupled with the relatively few number of people about made the conditions ideal for criminals. Even if you lived within a town with law enforcement, there was no way to summon them when you needed them, and no expectation that they would show up and save you before the criminal had completed his business with you. This works in the favor of our protagonists. The story is told by Eli Sisters, the younger brother of Charlie, and the Sisters Brothers are killers who work for a gentleman known as the Commodore. During the course of the book we find out how this came about and the factors contributing to their journey down this path. Charlie, it seems, is well-suited for this life and enjoys it, while Eli is feeling less fulfilled by his career choice. He has more empathy and compassion for the people they meet on their journeys, as well as their victims, and this empathy does not lend itself to success as a gunslinger. The story is rather journalistic in tone, and Eli's doubts and unhappiness surround the events as they unfold. He has a soft spot for ladies, even whores, and it is obvious he yearns for a woman of his own: \"I saw my bulky person in the windows of the passing storefronts and wondered, When will that man there find himself to be loved?\" (56). His sympathy for people causes him to reject the notion that violence is always the answer, and he and Charlie clash on this issue time and again. Their relationship goes through ups and downs, but as true brothers, their fights and disagreements cannot break the bond between them. They are on a mission for their employer: to find and kill Hermann Kermit Warm. Eli vows it will be his last job--he's done with killing. Charlie plans to continue without his brother. The search for Warm takes them from Oregon City to the goldfields of California. Along the way, they meet many unusual characters: The weeping man, who appears periodically (always crying), an old woman who they decide is a witch, a prospector who brews dirt for coffee, and various other wretches. One is a boy who has been deserted by his father and tries to attach himself to them. He keeps getting hit on the head by everyone he encounters, and Eli, who restrains Charlie from striking him, notes that \"even I wanted to clout him on the head. It was a head that invited violence,\" (112). It is a tale of another time, peopled by odd characters, related by a lonely, compassionate killer. The ending seems, to me, rather poetic. I highly recommend it, and don't be put off if you are not a western fan. In my opinion, it transcends any label. ...more Not your classic western novel. Great name, wonderful cover, lovely content, amazing storytelling. Shortlisted for the Booker prize 2011. I was watching a western comedy with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson when I thought that I should read a proper western novel at some point.

Great name, wonderful cover, lovely content, amazing storytelling. Shortlisted for the Booker prize 2011. I was watching a western comedy with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson when I thought that I should read a proper western novel at some point. When I was little, I used to enjoy Karl May but that was the last time I immersed myself into this genre. That evening, I started to browse the only western I owned ( if I don't count the Gunslinger) and I found myself in love with the author's voice right from the start. The Sisters brothers are Eli and Charlie, 2 famous paid killers working for the Commodore. They are hired to find and kill a prospector in San Fransisco. The novel presents their journey to California and their adventures while they are there. Eli and Charlie could not be more different from each other. Charlie is bossy, impulsive, a bit of psychopath, loves to drink and does not hold too much respect for his brother. Eli, on the other hand, is sensitive, loves his brother, cares for his horses, does not enjoy killing people uselessly and his dream is to settle down with a woman. The story is told by Eli, and oh, it is such a beautiful voice. I cannot exactly pinpoint what I loved so much about this book but I guess it is the story telling and the introspect into Eli\u2019s feelings about his job, his brother and the relationship with his horse. It was moved by his candid feelings and could not help but sympathise with Eli, despite him being a killer. ...more Have to be honest, this book (great premise) was so uneventful for me. Lacked tension, flat characters, some bright moments of sharp dialogue, but too brief to redeem it. Zero sense of place or time. A western? Not at all what I expected, but I'm so unmoved that I don't even feel cheated. That some reviewers are making favourable Cormac McCarthy & Deadwood comparisons is the only thing about this that raises my pulse. Quite an amazing journey of a book. Prior to (or, perhaps, instead of) a review, I point to the cover: it's fantastic. The moon, with the Sisters brothers' heads like dark eyes in a skull - and whose skull is that? Why, it's Shakespeare's, is it not? Indeed, there is something Shakespearean about this book - in its primal motivations; its themes of guilt, blame and remorse; the thickness of family ties; the inevitable playing out of fate.

Indeed, there is something Shakespearean about this book - in its primal motivations; its themes of guilt, blame and remorse; the thickness of family ties; the inevitable playing out of fate. A tragi-comic morality play - although I have to confess, while I like my comedy black, I missed the comedy here entirely. I wouldn't be surprised if there were Shakespearean allusions all over the place - likely to various history plays, of which I'm not well-read. If not in the broad strokes of the plot and characterization, certainly in the themes. Mike Reynolds' - in his very fine review here - warns against comparisons (and rightly so), but I can't help myself as something was dogging me all the while reading this. It is this: Dead Man , a little known Jim Jarmusch-directed, Johnny Depp film (back before he sold his soul to Disney). Poetic, evocative, symbolic, allusive and surreal; shot in black and white, with a spare and haunting Neil Young soundtrack. You like this; try that. ...more I'm not quite sure what I read here;I'll have to file this one under Cutesy or Gimmicky. The author has put some thought into the premise and has really come up with some promising characters in the protagonists, a pair of killers for hire who happen to be on the payroll of a mysterious entity known only as \"The Commodore\". The mission the brothers have committed to requires them to kill a prospector who has developed a secret formula that enables him to find gold with a minimum of effort.

The mission the brothers have committed to requires them to kill a prospector who has developed a secret formula that enables him to find gold with a minimum of effort. If that isn't a James Bond story adapted to a western theme, it will do until such a story comes along. The story is narrated by the fat brother (hey, I didn't write it) whose narration is, I think, intended to be funny. Instead, the story comes out flat, the dialogue is lame, and the characters never fully developed, with the exception of the brothers and the prospector. The action, if such it can be called, is mentioned usually as an aside or afterthought. In my estimation the writer was not focussed on where he wanted his story to go; he had a comedy, a horse opera, and a spy/adventure story on the go and came up short on all three. I did get all weak in the knees when reading a couple of deWitt's quotes, which I will share with you: What a life it is for man's animals, what a trial of pain and endurance and senselessness (P. 241) You are afraid of hell. But that's all religion is, really. Fear of a place we'd rather not be, and where there's no such a thing as suicide to steal us away.

that Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel won the 2012 Booker. In the next few weeks, that book along with the nominees will start showing up in our bookstores here in Manila. I'd seen Narcopolis by Jeet Thayil already prior to the announcement but it is still hardcover so it is quite pricey so I resisted. I also thought I'd like to start with the winner and then the runner-ups. Just like what I did for last year's Booker shortlisted novels and the eventual winner. In fact, last year I just heard that Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel won the 2012 Booker. In the next few weeks, that book along with the nominees will start showing up in our bookstores here in Manila. I'd seen Narcopolis by Jeet Thayil already prior to the announcement but it is still hardcover so it is quite pricey so I resisted. I also thought I'd like to start with the winner and then the runner-ups. Just like what I did for last year's Booker shortlisted novels and the eventual winner. In fact, last year's batch was the first one that I completed buying and reading. My Verdict: Unlike the many previous years' lists, I agree with last year's winner and I agree that these books are all worth reading: 4 STARS (I really liked these): 3 STARS (I liked these): For me, Half Blood Blues could have stolen the prize because of its strong theme. It's just Julian Barnes' prose is flawless compared to quite alienating prose of Esi Edugyan. My next favorite is Pigeon English because of its innocence yet strong message. Jamrach's Menagerie is a fun read because of Dickensian and Treasure Island flavors and can qualify as a children's book. My least liked is Snow Drops because during that time, I was not yet familiar with noir and crime fiction. Now, for The Sisters Brothers. First, I thought that this was about sisters and brothers. It was after a couple of pages when I realized that this is about two very different men, two brothers, whose surname is Sisters. The story has two settings: Oregon, where the brothers originate and California, where the Gold Rush is happening. The two brothers are tasked to kill a rich man for another man, who they haven't met, who pays them. Charlie and Eli Sisters are gun-for-hire assassins. At the start of the story, Charlie says that he should call the shots for them. Eli resists but he cannot do anything and this resistance, coupled with the mysterious and funny people they meet along the way, make him question and ponder the reason for their existence and if what they are doing is right. So, the travel from Oregon to California is like a moral exodus similar to Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan. It's is just modern, funny and at times, gruesome. I liked this book. It came to me when I already started reading some Western books so I was able to get in to the nature of these cowboy characters and their surrounding - the Wild West. ...more", "Title": "The Sisters Brothers"},
