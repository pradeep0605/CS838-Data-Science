TURN BACK NOW! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! SERIOUSLY YOU THERE IS NO RETURN BEYOND THIS POINT! ... Alright, everyone gone? *cracks knuckles* I LOATHED this book. Holy fucking shit. I really don't feel like I can properly explain my criticisms without going into detail... so here we go! Our story begins with the arrival of Ruby (a.k.a. redhead, pale skin, kinda pretty MC) to her older sister and brother-in-law's fancy, million-dollar home. Ruby's mother has seemingly abandoned her, and after a valiant attempt at living on her own in a roach-infested flat, she is found out and promptly delivered to her only known family, Jamie and Cora. The same night she arrives, after some internal monologue about how she doesn't need anyone else, especially not her hoity toity sister and her plush, white carpets, Ruby decides to make a break for it. *trumpets* Enter: Nate Cross. *trumpets* Sexy, blonde, star-athlete, most-popular-kid-in-school, runs-6.2-miles-every-Friday neighbor, who happens to be swimming laps in his pool at 1:30 am, sees Ruby hopping her fence, and covers for her when she is inevitably caught by her sister's husband. I don't even remember what bullshit these two came up with to explain why Ruby was halfway over the fence in the middle of the night, but it's irrelevant. HE'S THE LOVE INTEREST DUN DUN DUN! On top of that, it seems Jamie and Cora have arranged for Nate to be her personal ride to school! Gee that's convenient. This book is laden with small conveniences like this that do not happen in real life. Like really what're your chances of moving into a rich neighborhood next to a hottie your exact age, who's also nice enough to agree to drive you to school every day? In the first part of the novel, we are led to believe that Cora is awkward, cold, and ultimately put out about Ruby's presence in her \"perfect life.\" Jamie plays peacemaker, interacting with Ruby and trying to amp up her enthusiasm about making new friends, attending his alma mater (a.k.a. rich kid school where a burnout like Ruby DEF won't fit in omg), and potentially attending college. When presented with what could be considered a \"clean slate\" Ruby proceeds to be a complete asshole, often grumbling about every fucking thing. You know what Ruby? How about you just let the hot boy drive you to school? How about you just pick out a coy fish at the pet store? How about you let your sister get you some new fucking clothes? HOW ABOUT YOU JUST EAT THE GODDAMN BREAKFAST FOOD JAMIE SET OUT FOR YOU!? Like, this is easy shit! Stop being awful about general human kindnesses. On top of that Cora isn't much better than Ruby. I saw no chemistry whatsoever between she and Jamie, and I'm still wondering how they've been married for five years. Even though a story about how they fell in love was hinted at, it was never disclosed. Jamie is excited about everything. He's adopted a dog, who is old and frequently pees inside the house, about which Cora is angry. Jamie is building a pond in the backyard, which he's loudly working on early Saturday morning. Cora is angry. Cora would've preferred a pool. Jamie wants to take cute holiday pictures with his family in matching shirts. Cora doesn't really wanna but eventually does. Because she loves her husband, I GUESS. So up until this point, I'm thinking I've got a good handle on these characters. WRONG! After having a decently traumatizing conversation with Cora about Ruby's entire fucking life being a lie, she spirals out of control for a brief moment. She gets drunk with some old, not rich friends. She finds out her best friend is sleeping with her... casual boyfriend... and she collapses, wasted in the woods on her way back to her drunk friend's car. DA DA DA DAAAA In swoops hot boy Nate, who finds her in the woods somehow, and brings her home. When she arrives, she is met with a furious Jamie. No no, not just furious. He's R A G I N G! \"After everything we've done for you!? After we take you in and give you everything!? You didn't even stop to think that someone might be worried about you!? HOW DARE YOU! YOUR SISTER DOESN'T NEED YOUR SHIT RUBY!!\" Like whoa boy. Hold on a second. Ruby has literally been leading the shittiest kind of life for years. That's clear by the fact that her mother left her without warning. On top of that, she's just found out that her mother has been lying to her about Cora's attempts to reach out. YOU KNOW RUBY IS A CHILD WITH PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW HER SITUATION. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THOSE THINGS TO A CHILD. OF COURSE SHE DOESN'T THINK ANYONE WORRIES ABOUT HER YOU STUPID FUCK, SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE WITH NORMAL FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. After this blowup, Jamie never even apologizes. In fact, Cora tells Ruby that if she wants Jamie to talk to her again, she'll have to be the one to make the first move. I just want to point out how extremely problematic I find this set up. A grown ass man. One who is apparently a CEO. A CEO who should have plenty of practice dealing with failure, mishaps, mistakes. Completely losing his shit at a 17-year-old he just met a couple weeks ago. Inappropriately making the situation about his own perceived offense instead of about Ruby's personal crisis. Is not reprimanded for his bullshit behavior and never apologizes. Needless to say this was the end for me and Jamie. So whatever, now Cora and Ruby aren't enemies anymore. Yay I guess. Another aspect of this story I hated is this hyper focus on the key Ruby wears around her neck. It's her house key on a fucking chain. But the whole goddamn town is fascinated by this key. So much so that Ruby's employer, Harriet, starts making replicas of the necklace to sell in her jewelry store. Guys, this amazing, wonderful, unique key is described as \"a normal key with some gemstones on it.\" ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? This gets so out of hand that the fucking newspaper is doing a story about Harriet's key necklaces. Like what the fuck is wrong with this town? IT'S A KEY ON A CHAIN??? Unless you're making key necklaces that look like this: I just don't see how it'll be considered newsworthy. Whatever. Near the end the story shifts gears almost entirely and starts focusing on the issue of Nate's father being an controlling, abusive ass. It was jolting to me because it felt like Ruby just \"got better\" immediately. So much so that she was able to focus all of her attention on fixing someone else's issues. Like, after a couple months with Jamie and Cora she's just alright now? She cares about her grades and not getting in trouble and says \"fuck you\" easily to all her old burnout friends all because now she lives in a rich suburb? I'm sorry that's stupid as fuck. Shit doesn't just fix itself after a whole lifetime of abuse and neglect. But hey, this had to be a happy story I guess. So everything wrapped up nicely with a little bow. Nate gets away from his dad. Ruby graduates and gets into college. Tada. On top of all this shit, there's just a ton of components in this story that rubbed me the wrong way. Casual slut shaming, anger over not establishing proper boundaries in a relationship, reinforcing the \"he picks on you because he likes you\" saying, the MC being squeamish about female reproductive organs, unrealistic characters, and a storyline I ultimately didn't give a fuck about. I tried. I truly tried. But nah. ***FYI: If you would like to peruse a lovely collection of key necklaces like the one featured in my review you can shop here !*** ...more This was my second book by <---A>Sarah Dessen</---A> and it didn't disappoint.

I loved this story, I especially liked the way Dessen incorporates Rubys two 'lives' and how Ruby interprets and evaluates her own actions. Ruby is a lovely intelligent character but I don't know how this story would've worked had she been arrogant and angry, maybe it wouldn't have hence the story of a girl who faced with choices makes mistakes but ultimately knows the right path to follow. ...more 4.5 stars Another hit for Dessen! This one was darker like Dreamland and I really love that about it. It felt like I was there, a fly on the wall. I appreciated the MCs and the supporting characters in this one. This book was so beautiful, it taught me so much and I felt so good after reading this book. The thing about Sarah Dessen's books are that it isn't always about the romance. There is a more important story taking place and on of the side stories is the romance. If the book only focused on romance, it wouldn't have been as impressive as this actually was. \u201cWe can't expect everybody to be there for us, all at once.

So it's a lucky thing that really, all you need is someone. \u201d A few months before Ruby was going to turn 18 years old, her mother abandoned her. Ruby managed to live on her own for a couple of months but then she got busted. She was sent to live with her older sister Cora, who she hasn't seen in 10 years and her sister's husband, Jamie. When Ruby lived with her rich sister, she didn't know what she was missing out on, she had a new family, who were willing to provide her with whatever she needs and money for new clothes. But for some reason, Ruby feels confused and feels like she doesn't know the true meaning of family. How will Ruby get over this uneasy feeling and accept everything that has happened to her? \u201cBut sometimes, we just have to be happy with what people can offer us. Even if it\u2019s not what we want, at least it\u2019s something. You know?\u201d One of the things that I really liked about this story was the characters. Jamie was the most welcoming person that I have ever read about. I wish I met him on the first day of high school, because of the fact that no one was welcoming. The first day of high school was the worst, but if Jamie were there, he would make everyone feel welcomed. Cora was another character I loved and I love how she goes with everything Jamie says, even if it can be really embarrassing. Nate was nice but I wish he were more open about his problems instead of hiding everything with a huge smile. Ruby was a mess near the beginning but I really like her. Olivia is a nice friend, even if she has her flaws. Gervais, I wish you could tutor me, he would save my grades and future! \u201cNot everything's perfect, especially in the beginning. And its all right to have a little bit of regret every once in a while. It's when you feel it all the time and can't do anything about it... that's when you get into trouble\u201d The relationships were nice and made a great addition to the story. When you see small snippets of Jamie and Cora's relationship, the book is so much more realistic. The bonding between Gervais and Ruby were hilarious, they were like brother and sister. Nate and Gervais's relationship was also really nice to read. Reggie and Harriet was so nice and I wish we got to read more about them. And Nate and Ruby's relationship was another factor that was sweet. Olivia and Ruby are amazing and I am so glad they met each other. Cora and Ruby's relationship is something I wish I could have with my sister, we don't get along at all.. \u201cIf you expect the worst, you'll never be disappointed.\u201d The thing that I like about Sarah Dessen's books is how you could connect with the characters. It's interesting to see how much you can relate to her characters and I love that so much about her books. Whenever I come across something the character says that I agree on, I scream \"I KNOW RIGHT,\" and forget that I am in class... Anyway, I love the setting of her books and how most of them connect and you could see the characters from another book she wrote interact with each other. I'm almost done my marathon on Sarah Dessen books and I am kinda upset because I love her books so much. \u201cThe further you go, the more you have to be proud of. At the same time, in order to come a long way, you have to be behind to begin with. IN the end, though maybe it's not how you reach a place that matters. Just that you get there at all.\u201d I highly recommend this book, if you haven't read any Sarah Dessen books and I recommend you pick this up if you read a Sarah Dessen book too. I enjoyed this so much, it was fast-paced and really easy to relate to. From all the books I have read by Sarah Dessen so far, I feel like this one is the saddest one by far. If you haven't read a contemporary novel by Sarah Dessen, I suggest that you give it a shot. \u201cThe worst thing you can do if you miss or need someone is let them know it.\u201d ...more That was a shock.

She has no idea where her mother went, and hasn't heard from her since. Ruby has been getting by, just barely but this is about to change when the landlords of the tiny house they've been renting, discover she's alone. They alert the authorities, and suddenly Ruby is taken in by her sister Cora. Things were different when Ruby's sister Cora still lived at home, she sort of made it her job to care for Ruby and protect her from their mother. However, Cora's been gone for ten years, left when she went off to college, and Ruby's heard little from her since. This does not make for a happy reunion because Ruby doesn't want to let anyone in, let anyone close. She certainly doesn't welcome her sister's assistance. Ruby would rather just rely on herself, that way she has no one else to let her down. So she makes a plan to just stick it out at her sister's until she turns eighteen, then she's out of there. This story progresses nicely and I was seriously hooked watching the slow transformation of Ruby, seeing her thaw gradually. Helping with this is Jamie, Cora's sweet, generous, and very welcoming husband. You can't help but love him, he takes Ruby in with no questions or judgments made, always looking for the good, first, in people. Then there is Nate *sigh*. He is just the all-around popular, nice, HOT, next-door neighbor that takes to Ruby immediately, even with her reluctance. I didn't warm up to Cora at first, but then we learn some things about her, and I couldn't help but love her too. A Sarah Dessen novel would not be complete without her collection of quirky secondary characters. She always amasses these unique individuals that just grow on you. Gervais, the twelve-year old genius who rides along with Nate and Ruby everyday to school. Quote on Gervais: \"Gervais also lacked maturity, which meant he found things like burps and farts hysterical, and even funnier when they were his own. Put him in a small, enclosed space with two people every morning and there was no end to the potential for hilarity.\" (Yes, I was cracking up!) Olivia, a fellow student at Perkins Day, always talking on her phone in her free-time, but somehow becomes friends with Ruby. Then there's Harriet the caffeine-addict, and Reggie the vitamin seller. Even Roscoe, Cora and Jamie's dog, manages to get into Ruby's heart. While, The Truth About Forever and Just Listen , are my favorite Sarah Dessen novels, this one is very good, too. A definite recommend for any contemporary romance/YA lover. Just Listen ...more 4.5 stars. My favourite Sarah Dessen book so far!

There are so many different relationship dynamics in this book and I loved every single relationship. I liked all of the characters but I absolutely adored Jamie. He was such a sweetheart and I just thought he was so so lovely. The things he did for Cora made me love him even more. I loved Ruby's character development. She completely changed because she gradually opened herself up to new experiences and new people. It was a slow process where Ruby assessed situations and then after some time, her negative thinking changed to positive thinking. It was a very inspirational change. This book actually made me quite emotional in some parts which surprised me. It was just so heartwarming and it was such a lovely story. I absolutely loved how the relationship between Ruby and her sister, Cora took the front seat while the romance was a smaller subplot. Sarah Dessen's writing is awesome as per usual. She puts in the perfect amount of descriptions and her language is simple yet it is profound at times. The dialogue between her characters is really good (like always) and she writes a very realistic teenage girl. I really do love this book but there was something missing (I don't know what) and so I give it 4.5 stars, not 5.

For the first part of the novel Ruby's in a sort of self proclaimed denial. The reader begins the book and quickly learns that when Ruby's mom abandoned her she attempted to live by herself for a few months; but was eventually turned in to child services by her landlord. Cora, Ruby's estranged sister, takes custody of Ruby along with her husband, Jamie. WIth her new life Ruby faces all sorts of challenges. New school, \"friends\", job, habits, etc. But still Ruby is clinging to her past life and memories. I particularly loved the characters of Cora and Jamie. They were very believable and I thought that Dessen did an excellent job of endearing them to the reader. I had a few problems with Nate (the male star of the novel) and Ruby, but nothing that couldn't be overlooked. The plot could definitely be a bit confusing flopping between a fast and slow pace but in the end it all worked out. So what then makes me want to give this book only three stars? I would have to say I honestly don't know, just that things were missing. Maybe it was character depth for Ruby or Nate, or just the whole plot confusion thing that got to me, or the swearing (which by the way is fairly predominant).... I don't know. I'd recommend reading Lock and Key but not unless you have nothing more exciting to read. It's lacking, but still good. It really deserves three and a half stars but Goodreads doesn't let me do that!

It could have been built up into real character development, except that it wasn't. Instead, Ruby was cranky and uncooperative (imagine! a real life teenager!) until her sister told her what really happened when Ruby was a little girl, and then she was just... a teenager, but with less real angst. And then it devolved into \"I'm so worried about my boyfriend and what do you mean he's just like me, oh man, he's totally like me, I must have been a huge pain in the ass for everyone around me, yay kissing.\" I need someone to tell me if this is her standard book, or if I should give her a second chance, because I wasn't very impressed. ...more Confession: even though Dessen's novels are generally cheesy and melodramatic, I could not resist picking up Lock and Key.

Leaving her friends and her independence is difficult for Ruby. With the help of her sister, her brother-in-law, and a few new friends, Ruby will accept help from others and blossom. Here's my gripe: I think the author knows one topic--wealthy and wholesome suburban teens. When she tries to write about the disadvantaged or the outsiders, she displays her ignorance. I never really bought Dessen's \"pothead\" characterization of Ruby. Nor did I buy the maternal alcoholic scenario or any of the other not-so-pretty situations presented. Also, the melodrama was a bit much in this novel. Really, this novel was not my kind of teen novel. At all. ...more [Audiobook from OverDrive] I always love the narrations of Dessen books!

That whole, \"Do I have enough money?\" and wanting to save it in case of an emergency. And even though she goes to the rich kids' school, she finds that people have more layers than just that rich kid facade. Good good good. Ruby isn't a super complex/complicated character. Most of her life has been centered around her mom's wants and needs, so outside of that, she's hung out with potheads and-- surprise!-- pot dealers. So when she returns to those friends one afternoon, it's not a real surprise. Those friends did feel very stereotypically bad, though. It felt like one of those dramatization videos they'd show you in middle school health class about the dangers of drugs. They were all distant and cheating. It definitely made Ruby easier to split from that world, but you'd think someone would complain about her going to a better school and having a better living situation. World: I always love how Dessen leaves easter eggs from other books. A couple of characters from The Truth About Forever show up at Harriet's kiosk! EEP! I think all of her books are set in North Carolina. They never have a super southern feel to them, but always a nice cast of characters. Family: Gotta love the family focus of Dessen's novels. Ruby has to re-adjust to being accountable to family (Cora and Jamie... And Roscoe!) as well as welcoming other people into her world (Nate). I like that there's a juxtaposition happening as she sees how her \"family\" was, how her family is now, and how it compares to Jamie's gigantic family. There's also talk about abuse, siblings protecting one another, manipulation, Cora's infertility (for most of the book, she's struggling to get pregnant), and the feeling of neglect. The Boy (or, The Romance): Nothing too special there. Poor girl falls for rich (well, supposedly rich) boy. It was sad that the more layers were peeled back, the more sad Nate's story got. I'm glad that it was brought up about being the friend of someone receiving abuse. Ruby struggles with it being that she's lived through similar, but it's still hard for her. That's understandable. Overall, it's a decent book, good story. The characters were easy to get to know. ...more Reviewed by Jaglvr for TeensReadToo.com It's been a quite a long time that I found myself sitting up until three in the morning, wanting desperately to finish a story.

Custody of Ruby is given over to her older sister, Cora. Cora and her husband, Jamie, live in a wealthy community and live a life totally foreign to everything Ruby has ever known. Not trusting Cora and Jamie's intentions, Ruby plots an escape her first night in her new home. Making a break over the fence in the back yard, her escape is foiled by one rambunctious dog, Roscoe. Roscoe's barking brings a curious \"Hello?\" from the other side of the fence. Here she meets her next door neighbor, Nate. Nate's outlook on life is upbeat and infectious. But Ruby does everything she can to keep him at bay, as well. Slowly, Ruby learns to adjust the new life she has been given, and develop friendships in the most unlikely places. Ruby has always kept on the fringes and avoided being indebted to anyone. But as she grows and evolves, she realizes that maybe others need her just as much as she needs them. With a class assignment to define \"Family,\" Ruby understands that the word has many meanings, and most of them don't necessarily mean blood relations. Sarah Dessen writes another amazing novel for young adults. LOCK AND KEY is wonderful, heartfelt story. All of the characters draw you in and make you feel like you are part of their lives. Jamie's naivet\u00e9 is endearing. Cora's infertility struggles hit you in the heart. Olivia's tough girl exterior has cracks you get to see through. Harriett is just as harried as her name implies. And the perfect-seeming Nate has secrets all his own. My only regret with this book is that I failed to move it to the top of my To Be Read pile as soon as it arrived for review. So if you have this one sitting around at home, make it the next one you read. And if you've picked it up at the book store, considering purchasing it, definitely do so the next time you are there. You won't regret it! ...more This book ended up being so heartwarming that I'm still not over it! Lock and Key probably is one of my new favorites from Sarah Dessen, next to Just Listen .

But it takes place during the middle of the school year where Ruby transfers from Jackson, a public highschool, to Perkins Day, a private school, after she was sent to live with her sister Cora with her husband Jamie when her mother left her at their yellow house where they lived. Thankfully, the landlords notice her mother's absence and Ruby was sent to social services where she then was sent to her sister. And that's where her story began. How she was able to cope with the changes in her life, to Cora and Jamie, to having new friends, and meeting and understanding Nate, their next door neighbor. i love how Ruby was able to change for the better for the sake of the people she loved and growing some sense into her and had developed a sense of responsibility. I especially love Nate a lot! He is just so cool! He is also very different from other Sarah Dessen boys which were usually the emo-silent-weird type but Nate is what you call the \"role model\" where he is very popular in school. And I appreciate the slight change in her usual themes. AND, there where also cameos from the previous books, which if you haven't read Lock and Key yet is that you should check it out to find out who I was talking about. :) I am totally giving this book a 5/5 because I really enjoyed this one so much! I cannot wait to read her next books in the future and basically this is the last Sarah Dessen book I have read form her since I've read all her books. I hope she has a book coming out in 2012! :) ...more This was seriously an amazing stories. I've read a lot of good books, and this ranked somewhere near the top in the neverending list.

This was my first Sarah Dessen book, and after years of hearing people rave about her writing, I have to it admit, my expectations were pretty high. Buut, they were also met! I don't read contemporaries very often, but I was really feeling one at the time. (I'm also going to be meeting Sarah Dessen at NTTBF later on this month) I own five of her books and so I went to my shelves and looked at all the different synopsis's trying to decide which sounded best, and this one hit the nail on the head This was my first Sarah Dessen book, and after years of hearing people rave about her writing, I have to it admit, my expectations were pretty high.

(I'm also going to be meeting Sarah Dessen at NTTBF later on this month) I own five of her books and so I went to my shelves and looked at all the different synopsis's trying to decide which sounded best, and this one hit the nail on the head. And so I picked it up one night and finished it two days later. These characters and the story felt so real; it dealt with some difficult topics, but the author didn't sugar coat or shy away from them. The characters have been through a lot of terrible things and this just shows that you can come back from that, and that it is possible to heal. I loved the development all of these characters went through, how they interacted with each other and built one other up. The main theme of the book was family; what family means to each person individually. It was beautiful to see this theme woven throughout the storyline in such a flawless way. I HIGHLY recommend checking this book out, I had such an enjoyable time reading it and connecting with all of these incredibly unique characters. I can't wait to pick up more of Sarah Dessen's novels in the future whenever I'm in need of a good contemporary kick!

I've read Miranda Kenneally saying on Twitter how Dessen's books are like coming home for her, and for me it's the exact same thing.

I started reading them in 9th grade - back then I was still reading in German - and continued my obsession the following year during my exchange in the States, reading books in English for the first time. After I had finished all of them, I sort of forgot about them for a while, but in the last few years I found myself going back to my favorites again and again, when I was bored, or sort of lost, or in the mood for that special kind of contemporary, or just didn't know what else to read. When I started rereading them this summer, I was afraid that I might not like them anymore, that I grew out of them somehow. I mean, I knew I still loved This Lullaby , as I've read it every year since 9th grade, but I wasn't so sure about the others. Turns out that fear was completely unnecessary though. I think I especially loved Lock and Key even more this time than I did back when I was 16. So yes, Sarah Dessen books really are like coming home. \u2665 ...more Typical Sarah Dessen fare - fervent, fluffy, and full of superbly developed characters.

The book revolves around Ruby, a seventeen-year-old girl who had been living with her mother, until she is abandoned when her mom walks right out the door.

She planned to live on her own and move out when she turned eighteen, but is found out and as a result must live with her long-lost sister, Cora. Cora has established herself in a new life with a furnished home and her wealthy husband, Jamie. Ruby also meets Nate, the amazingly friendly boy next door, whose nice nature may hide something underneath. Ruby gradually comes to accept her new life and deal with her struggles from the past. Dessen's utilization of the lock and key metaphor throughout the book never ceased to amaze me. She managed to incorporate the theme everywhere, which was impressive, but became a bit overdone at some points. However, I would highly recommend this one if you are aching for another heartfelt story from a strong writer. ...more When Ruby's mother never comes home, leaving her to take care of the small rented house, keep their job bringing lost airport luggage to people, and making it to school all on her own for about three months, Ruby thinks she's handling things fine.

When the landlords discover she's been living like this, she's quickly taken away and given over to the care of her sister Cora, who, ten years older, married to a man who co-founded a Facebook-type online community, and a lawyer herself, hasn't been seen or heard from by Ruby since Cora left for university. Estranged from a sister she was once incredibly close to and even dependent on, Ruby's determined to make it on her own. After all, she'll be turning eighteen soon and then no one can hold her. Sent to the expensive, elite private school Cora's husband used to attend, she's also determined not to make any friends. It's all temporary, she doesn't fit in. But her good-looking neighbour Nate slowly draws her into a real friendship - until she realises he's just like her, refusing to let anyone help when it really matters, and Ruby has to decide whether she really wants to be like her mother, running from those who need her, or like Cora, protective and compassionate. I have mixed feelings about this book. The writing is fine enough, the pacing steady, and so on, but there was a very formulaic feel to the novel. It was like watching a typical Hollywood drama, or a Danielle Steele telemovie. It was just so neat . So tidy . Even when Ruby was visiting her old drug-dealer friend and on/off lover, there was no real grit. It wasn't that Ruby's story wasn't believable, but that Dessen herself had packaged it so nicely. I don't know anything about the author, but it felt like she was writing about something she didn't really understand. Other aspects of the story, like the story arc itself, were horribly conventional and predictable. Sadly, there's nothing original here - unless you count the 'orrible gaff of saying \"Organic free-trade\" instead of \"Organic Fair Trade\" (p.133) - there's a BIG difference! (and you don't say something's Free Trade; it's the default, the whole idea is that Free Trade exploits people and Fair doesn't, therefore it's a selling point). The characters were clich\u00e9s, even Ruby, who struggled to exude any kind of charisma, and I'm wondering whether there are any teen books out there that aren't about beautiful rich people. Why did Cora and her husband Jamie need to be so incredibly wealthy? Simply to provide the opposite extreme to Ruby's previous life? It came across as garish and insensitive. Why doesn't anyone write stories about the middle class? Or maybe I should say, why doesn't anyone want to read them? Lock and Key is a terribly safe story. It attempts to examine issues of the heart, growing up, dealing with extremes - but other than making an effort to \"show\" rather than constantly \"tell\", it's heavy-handed and often boring. Having beaten the book down so much, I do have to add that it was a pleasant read, fairly intriguing, and I did feel sympathetic for Ruby, Cora and Jamie at times - but I'm not terribly interested in reading more of Dessen's books. But I have little doubt that as a young teenager I would have really enjoyed this book, so it's probably an age thing. ...more This is the first novel I've read by Sarah Dessen, but boy let me tell you, it will defiantly not be my last!!

I don't usually read these kind of realistic, intense stories, but Dessen left me in \"awe\" as I read, and now, I cannot wait to read more of these kinds of books! At times I wanted to reach into the book and hug the characters, they were so likeable because of their amazing strength, they go through so much. It was so inspiring to read about what the main character has gone through, but still managing to fight through it. Ruby doesn't have it easy. Ever since her parents divorced, her mother has never been the same. Her mother smokes, drinks, and doesn't come home from time to time. Ruby stays by her mother's side and does anything she can for her. Ruby's sister, Cora, used to live with them until she left to College. Since then, they haven't been in touch, she has a new life now, which doesn't include Ruby. She has come to live with the fact that her sister doesn't want to speak to them anymore. Days pass and Ruby's mother doesn't come home. This doesn't surprise Ruby so she takes care of herself, and manages to do so for a little while--Until the bills start piling up and she has no choice but to leave. She's not eighteen yet, and the social workers are forcing her to go live with her sister, Cora. Ruby has no choice. She hasn't seen Cora in ten years, and when she enters their home, she's shocked. She has an amazing house and a wealthy husband who is extremely nice. Though, all Ruby wants to do is pack her things and return to her home. She wants to leave, but that becomes difficult when Cora and her husband, Jamie want to do everything they can for her. Ruby tries to settle, fit in at a new private school, and manages to meet a few people along the way. Her neighbour, Nate Cross, is the popular, king of everything at school, blonde swimmer who she meets the day she moves in. She tells herself that he's not her type, and that they have nothing in common, but the more they get to know eachother, the more they realize that they couldn't be more alike.. Ruby keeps to herself and denies the friendship her and Nate have. She doesn't want to get attached to anyone, because all she wants to do is leave when she turns eighteen--But as days turn into weeks, Ruby meets new people, settles into her new home, and realizes; ''That sometimes, in order to save yourself, you've got to reach out to someone else..'' This was such a great book! It was beautifully written, and very heartwarming. At times it was emotional, and the the character's feelings came off the page and made you become fully apart of the novel. I absolutely loved this book, everything about it was just so great!

The story tells about the drastic adjustments and changes in Ruby's life. She has difficulty dealing with these changes and she is quite annoying because of this attitude. Reading how ruby changed and understand more about life and chances are really intense which kept my interest that i flew through the pages. And then there is Nate, the boy next door who himself is facing his own problems. Ruby and Nate's love interest is totally not the focus in the book. This book has more to offer than that. The supporting characters have their own stories as well which give more flavor to the story. This coming of age book is a page turner and I definitely recommend this to contemporary and YA readers.

It's been a while since I can say that a book was picture perfect from beginning to end, but I really did find this book worked great. I had no issues with the writing, dialogue, plot, setting or pacing. I went and borrowed a ton of other Sarah Dessen books from the library as soon as I finished \"Lock and Key.\" I read this for the \"Key to My Heart\" square for Romance Book Bingo 2017. The main character in \"Lock and Key\" is Ruby Conner. Ruby is a senior at Jackson High School living in North Carolina. Through bits and pieces we find out that Ruby was in foster care temporarily after it becomes known that she is living alone and her mother is nowhere to be found. Placed with her older sister Cora that she hasn't seen in years, \"Lock and Key\" is really Ruby's journey learning to figure out what it truly means to be family, and how sometimes the hardest thing to do is stay and just support someone. I freaking loved Ruby. I mean loved her. I wanted to hug her, give her some chocolate cake, and tell her that she is awesome. I have never fallen so quickly into another teen character's head since Harry Potter. Ruby's vulnerability and her general belief that she could take care of herself with help from no one we see get reworked from the beginning of the book to the end. Ruby and Cora's shaky relationship due to Ruby's belief that her sister had abandoned her we also see slowly changes through the course of the book. I loved that Dessen didn't just throw out hey Ruby you are wrong from other characters either. Ruby had to see and feel that her way or really her mother's way of acting was just not what she needed anymore. Ruby's reluctant friendship with Nate also got me too. I loved how she got to see that someone who she thought had a perfect life, really did not, and that her just saying this is too hard, was actually not what he or she needed. All of the secondary characters got to shine in this too. I loved Nate. Man oh man, his backstory regarding his mother and his father was just heartbreaking. A kid who doesn't want to be in the situation he is, but doing the best he can until he is 18 and can be free. Ruby's sister Cora was also such a great character. There is a scene when Cora's husband Jamie is rightfully angry and yelling at Ruby, and Cora steps in front of her like she did when they were kids and their mom was on a tear. I wanted to hug them both. We get to see that Cora is just as unsettled having what she considers a \"good\" life and not being used to things like huge family dinners, Christmas cards, etc. I loved Harriet and Reggie, and heck pretty much everyone. Well except for Ruby's old friends at Jackson who she got to see for herself were not true blue friends at all. The writing takes a look at a lot of things. Drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, and even abandonment. Dessen does a good job of not prettying things up which I appreciated. I also applaud her since she writes Ruby really well. I have a hard time with some YA authors having teens talking like characters from Dawson's Creek. That was always my big thing about that show, no one my age sounded that pretentious. Did we sound like asses though? Yes, all teens do at one time or the other. The flow was great too. We pretty much get to see Ruby over a course of a school year til her graduation which I really appreciated. Spare me from books that have a character do a day/night change in a month or two. It's not realistic. It would have been great to see Ruby in her therapy sessions, but I was happy with what we got. The setting of Lakeview, North Carolina sounded pretty polarizing. When Ruby is transferred from Jackson to what she considers the rich kid school, I was so happy we didn't see some Mean Girls shtick in this book. We got to see a lot of secondary characters there with tons of nuance as well. The ending was really great. I can picture Ruby and now her family and her family of choice. I am going to see if Dessen ever follows up on Ruby and others from this book. It looks like she revisits the town of Lakeview in a lot of books, so it be nice to see a shout out to Ruby and other characters we have met. ...more The book Lock and Key by Sarah Dessen is what my project is about.

She starts visiting the old house and her old, no good, horrible friends. Her sister and brother-in law begins to notice that this young adult is changing into a rude and selfish girl again. The brother-in law then sets up college applications and a good paying job and hopes for the best. This wonderful branch of help gets ruby back on her feet and shows her the bright future she has ahead of her. This book is by far my favorite book because your emotions go on a mental roller-coaster and it shows you that everybody goes through something. ...more \u201cWhat is family?

It's a nice easy peasy YA read but there's a strength behind the words, and a great story about what really makes a family. Yes there's a little romance thrown in there but the relationship between estranged sisters Ruby and Cora is wonderful, and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it repair itself, as painful as the process was. ...more I chose to read this book after hearing great things about this author from my friend Jessica. I had high hopes going in to this and this book did not disappoint. As I've heard, Dessen's novels focus on teenage girls and coming of age moments/situations. This holds true for Lock and Key with the focus of this book on family, what it means to different people and what it means to be independent or to rely on others.
