In this case, the end of Children of Hurin also marks the end of my quest to read a book by each of my five favorite authors. It seems like a fitting way to end this journey, in that Tolkien is the oldest of my favorites, and if there was ever a modern author suited to end-of-quest tales, it was Tolkien. He was also the author on my list that gave me the greatest concern\u2014not only has he passed away, but his body of published work is relatively small. I didn\u2019t want to re-read the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings,<---M> not because I don\u2019t love them</---M>, but because I wanted to be able to read something new, just as I had with the other authors. Having read the Silmarillion several months earlier, I was hard pressed to think of what else to read. Sure, I could have gone for Letters From Father Christmas, or Farmer Giles of Ham, but neither of those somehow felt right. Tolkien\u2019s tales of Middle-Earth were what cemented him as one of my favorite writers, and I wanted to go back to Middle-Earth as part of this project. Fortunately, the publishing gods smiled upon me, and gave me Children of Hurin. This is another in a line of books composed by Tolkien\u2019s estate, taken from various notes, fragments, and other unfinished writings and molded into a coherent whole. In that respect, for the record, it\u2019s very well done. The text flows seamlessly from chapter to chapter, and I never once had the sense that I was reading something out of place or inauthentic. This feels like Tolkien\u2019s writing, and if it isn\u2019t exactly what he intended, I have to believe it\u2019s pretty damn close. But what of the story itself? The story of Hurin and his offspring is told as part of the Silmarillion, but not in the detail that Tolkien intended. Tolkien believed that this story was one that could be told apart from the Silmarillion as a whole\u2014that it was strong enough and vibrant enough to stand on it\u2019s own. And he is absolutely correct. Children of Hurin is an epic. It\u2019s also a tragedy. If you come into this book expecting glorious battles and happy endings, you will be sorely disappointed (though if you come to Tolkien expecting nothing but happiness and light, I submit you haven\u2019t read Tolkien very often or carefully). This is not a tale of good triumphing over evil, but a tale of a family brought down by an epic curse. More Macbeth than Star Wars, in other words. The writing itself is epic\u2014Children of Hurin reads a lot like Beowulf or the Iliad. Tolkien apparently originally tried to write the tale as an actual epic poem, but was never quite able to make it work. Still, his prose captures that same spirit, rhythm, and cadence. As a huge fan of epic and epic poem, I love it. Despite the epic prose and tragic scope, the characters of Children of Hurin are very well crafted, and ultimately, very human. Their actions, while not always rational, are often understandable, and while the tragedy has its origins in the supernatural (it is Morgoth who curses the line of Hurin), there is not a strong sense that the plot is forced simply by supernatural means. Instead, we get the sense that these are perhaps well meaning, but ultimately deeply flawed people, who suffer for their choices, and the choices of others. The final scene of the book, when Hurin is finally reunited with his dying wife, is absolutely heartbreaking. There\u2019s also a wonderful scene, much earlier, which really stuck with me, and I need to mention it here just because it\u2019s so wonderfully crafted. It occurs shortly after Hurin\u2019s capture by Morgoth, when Morwen, his wife, is trying to figure out what to do with herself and her children. Turin, the son, says something to the effect of \u201cI know my father is dead. He must be, because I know that his love for us is so strong that if he were alive, no chains could hold him, and no amount of enemies could keep him from returning to us.\u201d And Morwen\u2019s answer is \u201cI do not think either of those things is true, my son.\u201d It\u2019s a wonderful, if completely heartbreaking moment, where a child-like view of heroism clashes completely with the harsh realities of the world. It strikes me as a very Tolkien-esque moment; in many ways much of Tolkien\u2019s work deals with the interplay between heroics, and the personal cost or realities of those heroics. At least, that\u2019s my initial thought. In any case, it\u2019s an immensely powerful scene. The text of the book is aided by the wonderful illustrations done by Alan Lee, who has done a lot of Tolkien-related art in the past. His illustrations are interspersed in no particular order throughout the book, but each one of them is gorgeous, and really adds to the flavor of the text. It would have been neat to see some more of them. This is yet another Tolkien book I\u2019ll be re-reading in the future. It\u2019s a fine addition to the Middle Earth canon. ...more Gandolf, Poul Anderson, <---A>J.R.R.

I am not going to be able to do that here. I have spent more than twenty years with this story (since my mother first read the Unfinished Tales version aloud to me when I was eight years old), and if Christopher Tolkien had not put this volume together, I might have eventually had the hubris to do so myself. Let me start by making a couple of points. First: this is not a new book in any sense of the word, other than it is now standing on its own between two covers and without visible editorial apparatus for the first time. Second: Christopher Tolkien cannot be said to have written any portion of the narrative of this book, despite many reviewers intimations to the contrary. The bulk of this text appeared in Unfinished Tales , with significant gaps; Tolkien the son has filled in these gaps using the relevant sections from the (much more concise) version that was used in assembling The Silmarillion , as well as framing material at the beginning and end of the current volume, also from The Silmarillion . Christopher Tolkien has done little more here than the literary equivalent of very carefully stitching a few patches to mend the gaping holes in an otherwise noble and beautiful garment. On to the story itself, then. This is, as so many others have already noted with varying degrees of enthusiasm, a very dark tale. If you don't like very dark tales, well then, you will quite likely not like this. It is also in a prose style, as is the vast bulk of Tolkien's work, that is very susceptible to being called \"stilted\", because compared to contemporary prose, it is. But as at least one reviewer here has wisely noted the tone is in keeping with the tone of the Nordic sagas of which Tolkien was so fond of and inspired by. And like so many ancient sagas and myths, this tale is about an entire family haunted by a doom they cannot escape. Or is it? I think that Tolkien has done a wonderful job here of subverting the curse of Morgoth and the doom of H\u00farin and his kin with another motif: free will. Tolkien, who strenuously avoids almost any hint of allegory throughout his vast imaginative work, nevertheless imbued almost every corner of that world with reflections of his own deeply-held Catholic convictions and sensibilities. The core of the story is the tension between doom/fate on the one hand and free will on the other. T\u00farin makes decision after decision that invariably lead to tragic consequences. But does he do so because he is doomed to do so? Or because he is a man of haughty pride who stubbornly refuses to consider any viewpoint but his own, using his considerable gifts (natural charisma and rightfully-legendary physical/martial prowess) to charge willfully forward regardless of even foreseeable consequences to anyone and everyone around him? I believe that it is very much the latter, but without necessarily completely repudiating the former. The malice of such a being as Morgoth is a very real force in the tale of the Silmarils, and such malevolence bent upon a single family, and largely upon a single individual as T\u00farin rises to prominence, can be understood to have tangible effect on individuals and events. And even on a more mundane level, the incursions and aggressive actions of Morgoth's forces, both the marauding armies of Orcs and the Easterlings who occupy T\u00farin's childhood homeland, can be understood to push T\u00farin in a particular direction in his life that he might not have gone had circumstances in his life and in his world been otherwise. So there is some range to the senses in which Morgoth can be said to have cursed the children of H\u00farin. But T\u00farin has also grown up the proud child of a proud mother; effectively orphaned from the age of nine, he receives ostensibly every advantage, yet the pride instilled in him from the earliest age tragically unravels every opportunity he is presented with from his youthful fostering in the halls of Thingol onwards. It is his human choices, not the supernatural force of an evil will, that guide him on his tragic path, and this complex narrative thread is what makes this, to my mind, one of the greatest of all of Tolkien's tales. ...more Instead of The Children or H\u00farin, this book should be entitled The story in which (view spoiler) [Everybody Dies (hide spoiler) ] by J.R.R.

However, this book missed the drive and compactness that his other books possessed and I didn\u2019t like it as much as I hoped I would.

Evidence of the unfinished state Tolkien left the tale in. But this actually gives a more authentic feeling to the story. Like a recovered Saga or Epic that is missing a few passages. Hurin is high fantasy and if it were not set in the world of Tolkien's other stories it would be as unaccessible as the Kalevala.

This is a well-told tale with engaging characters and plenty of action that keeps the reader interested throughout. While not as enthralling as the Lord of the RIngs Trilogy, or as entertaining and wonderful as The Hobbit, The Children of Hurin is a worthy addition to the Middle-Earth cannon and is a more complete novel than most other source material that is out there. It stands on it's own well and one does not need to have read any of the other histories to follow along with what is going on here. Overall, a solid work that I'd recommend to fans of Tolkien's works or epic fantasy in general. ...more This a much darker tale than Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit.

To enslave an entire people shows the cunning of this most wicked dragon. The mention of Sauron was a nice foreshadowing. I think Christopher did a fine job of putting this together from all his Father's notes and writings.

The archaic-sounding prose might also be a problem for readers who are only used to modern fiction. The telling is indeed matter of fact and archaic, but I think since it makes the story read like folklore, it rightly serves its purpose. I kind of guessed at some of the events that would unfold in the tale, but not even that lessened my enjoyment of it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes tragedies and sad stories in general. You don\u2019t have to have read the more popular works of Tolkien to appreciate this story in itself. Like I mentioned, the language (especially Tolkien\u2019s made up one) could be a problem, but once you get used to the narrative style and all the weird-sounding names, you could end up really liking it. ...more This book is only for the serious JRR Tolkien fan.

I wonder what will happen in this chapter???)

Per the afterword by Christopher Tolkien, this isn't quite the same as the version he assembled for publication in Unfinished Tales of N\u00famenor and Middle-Earth -- partly because he added in bridging text that he'd excluded from the Unfinished Tales version (because it essentially duplicated passages already found in The Silmarillion) and partially because he's had an additional quarter century to further decipher and analyze his father's papers. Stylistically, this is probably a little closer to The Silmarillion than to Lord of the Rings -- it has the same kind of formal prose that at times almost echoes the cadences of the King James Bible. Probably recommended only for completists or super-fans, of which I am unabashedly one. ...more Holy mackerel. To be honest, I've never been into depressing books or tragedies.

I was really scared to start this, since I'd heard that it was pretty dark and depressing (view spoiler) [and that it involved incest (hide spoiler) ] , but I actually really enjoyed it. In my opinion, it wasn't so bad. The only reason this isn't a five-star book for me is that it wasn't the most uplifting book (obviously) and I didn't exactly enjoy a couple parts of it (view spoiler) [like the whole incest thing... (hide spoiler) ] . Overall, it was good book, just not as awesome as LotR or The Hobbit. :D ...more The Children of Hurin is a beautiful book. I bought the hardcover collector's edition for a small fortune as books go ($75) and let me just say that Alan Lee's illustrations are exquisite. I read the book immediately and will say that it is a must for any lifelong Tolkein fans. Tolkein's works were a huge part of my childhood and my mom would read them to me before I could read. She had to stop reading them because I would ask too many questions so I read them myself when I was eight or nine. Thi The Children of Hurin is a beautiful book. I bought the hardcover collector's edition for a small fortune as books go ($75) and let me just say that Alan Lee's illustrations are exquisite. I read the book immediately and will say that it is a must for any lifelong Tolkein fans. Tolkein's works were a huge part of my childhood and my mom would read them to me before I could read. She had to stop reading them because I would ask too many questions so I read them myself when I was eight or nine. This story is one of Tokein's oldest. He started the tale of Turin Turambar in 1910 in the form of epic poetry (iambic pentameter if I remember correctly). The story appears in condensed form in The Silmarillion. Here, the narrative is fleshed out and edited by Christopher Tolkein because J.R.R never finished it. This is really strange to me because it is said that J.R.R. most identified with the tale's hero, Turin, out of any of his other characters. That being said, I wouldn't recommend this work to anyone except hardcore Tolkein fans. The narrative is mired tightly within Tolkein's obscure legends of Middle Earth. The narrative reads like a Greek tragedy. Turin is cursed from the start. Hurin, Turin's proud and valiant father, is captured by Morgoth, the enemy, after the loss of the War of Unnumbered Tears. Morgoth curses Hurin's children and keeps him alive to watch their misery from atop a mock throne for most of his life. Turin becomes a great warrior both proud and noble yet falls victim to the curse of Morgoth. He accomplishes many great deeds yet destroys or perverts everything close to him. He slays his best friend unawares, marries his sister having never known her, and causes the destruction of one of elf kind's greatest civilizations. These are just some of the many of the consequences of Morgoth's curse. One could argue that Turin's own pride brought these horrors upon his own head. I really enjoy Tolkein to this day because of these crisp complexities. You can choose to read the book on its most simple levels and be just fine. But if you choose to delve into its deeper themes, I promise you will be rewarded with gold (or mithril - if you're a true fan). ...more There's so much to say about Tolkien's mastery of language and myth. But what's important and powerful about CoH is that it stands (stylistically) somewhere in between Silmarillion and LotR. There are no anachronisms in Silmarillion, which are present in LotR (and the Hobbit, of course). CoH is blissfully free of them, but is also less \"macro\" than Sil. CoH treads on solid (Middle) earth, but is not quite as intimate as LotR (E.g., with Frodo & the other hobbits).

Al sentarme a leer los Hijos de H\u00farin me lev\u00e9 la sorpresa de que no era una historia nueva y totalmente desconectada, como yo pensaba, sino que era una reescritura de una de las lineas argumentales del Silmarilion (una versi\u00f3n extendida para hablar en lenguaje cinematogr\u00e1fico). Esto fue algo que me sorprendi\u00f3, pero que no hizo m\u00e1s que interesarme por la lectura de esta \"nueva historia\" en Arda. La historia de los hijos de H\u00farin empieza en la \u00e9poca que su padre est\u00e1 siendo torturado por Morgoth. Turin, empieza a vivir como proscrito y tenemos una historia al mejor estilo Robin Hood, en la que el personaje principal empieza a esquivar tropas enemigas y vive pr\u00f3fugo. Es aqu\u00ed donde conoce al enano Mim, Mim busca ayudarlos, pero como todos sabemos las relaciones entre los enanos y los elfos no son muy buenas esta ayuda termina dando m\u00e1s problemas de los que ya ten\u00edan. Sin intensi\u00f3n de hacer spoilers, esta historia no solo es interesante sino que es completamente \u00e9pica (contando con una lucha final impresionante). De todas formas el libro pega muchos saltos temporales y por momentos la velocidad de la narraci\u00f3n es tal que cuesta llevarle el ritmo. Como todos los libros de Tolkien este nos muestra un mundo incre\u00edble, pero en el fondo se me hace que le falta algo. Es un buen libro para fans, pero si est\u00e1n empezando a leer a Tolkien les recomiendo empezar por otro lado. ...more After many years that I have been absent from Middle-Earth, I was finally able to get my hands on this book!!! First, let me tell you that I am a huge Tolkienite, and The Silmarillion is one of my favorite books ever. The thing is, it's been like 9 years since I last read it and naturally many details have slipped my otherwise sharp mind! What does that have to do with The Children of Hurin, you ask?

Well, if you haven't read The Silmarillion, it is near impossible to follow the story of this book!!! That's why it took me 10 whole days to finish it!!! After the first few pages I had to get The Silmarillion off the shelf and use it as a guideline and remembrance. As far as the story of The Children of Hurin is concerned, it is mainly the melancholic journey of Hurin's son, Turin, who struggled all his life to be just and find happiness, only to discover that the curse laid on him and his sister Nienor would always cast a shadow on him, leading only to loss and destruction, whether it is about friends or foes. The best part of this book was the ending, which was beyond sad!!! Turin and his sister Nienor never met, since she was born after Turin left to go live with the elves. When their roads finally cross, the things that occur between them are....bittersweet...though only sadness remains in the end. You really have to read it for yourself in order to grasp the meaning of my words! All in all, it was a book worth reading, as all Tolkien books are, if you ask me! You really invest in the characters, and all the twists and turns will leave you....numb.... 4 Stars!!! ...more Es un buen libro.

Pero hay algo en Tolkien que me sigue cautivando, y eso es el \"esp\u00edritu\" u \"alma\" que hay en su mundo. A pesar de que no cre\u00eda recordar casi nada del Silmarillion, este relato fue como la piedra de toca el fondo y mueve los sedimentos, volviendo todos los colores, personajes y emociones del universo de este autor. Y creo que si hablamos de crear una m\u00edstica y un mundo, Tolkien si que est\u00e1 entre los m\u00e1s grandes escritores.

Tolkien does a stellar job here. bravo. awesome read. Now, i am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy but The Children of Hurin was sorely disappointing. Though i have to give Tolkien credit for starting a good story i would have to give his son two thumbs down in his editing abilities.

I don't think i have ever read anything so coldly written in my life. There was no love in the book. I was depressed while reading it and had to make myself finish it. If there were more character building or even just some form of emotion aside from sadness and anger, i would have probably loved this book. But there wasn't and i believe it was a huge flop. When you read the Lord of the Rings you can tell that Tolkien loved what he was writing. There was so much involved in the telling and background of Middle-Earth; it was obviously thought-out. In the Children of Hurin you could tell it wasn't J.R.R. writing it. It was almost as if his son, Christopher found his father's notes, put in some connecting verbs, sent it to a publisher and since he was a Tolkien after-all, they published it. I'm ranting right now, i know. The potential is there, the story is a mix of Romeo and Juliet and the Oedipal complex. Two stories i have always loved. It was merely the deliverance that sucked. ...more The Children of Hurin will make you cry--it made me cry, and that's saying something.

And i agree, because the fate of the Children of H\u00farin was not an easy one, and it was full of despair and regret. I don't think this is book for those who don't like tragedy, but i doubt there is another tragedy like this which moved me to tears.

And i agree, because the fate of the Children of H\u00farin was not an easy one, and it was full of despair and regret. I don't think this is book for those who don't like tragedy, but i doubt there is another tragedy like this which moved me to tears. Also, Tolkien was one hell of a writer for tragedies! Once upon a time, a human - H\u00farin, dared in his captivity to mock the god of fates, Morgoth. The Dark Lord in retaliation cursed his whole family and for him to watch everything that will happen to his descendants, because their lives will be forever filled with tragedy. The main character of the story is T\u00farin, son of H\u00farin. Since he was cursed by Morgoth - everything he does, says, always backfires on him and those around him. Everything he ever wanted was always taken away from him. The saddest thing is, as a reader you know it's going to be hard for him, but you just can't imagine what more could possibly happen.... I think this is the best fanart of T\u00farin ever T\u00farin was described as being \"dark-haired and pale-skinned, ... his face more beautiful than any other among mortal Men, in the Elder Days. He was dark-haired as his mother, and promised to be like her in mood also; for he was not merry, and spoke little, though he learned to speak early and ever seemed older than his years. T\u00farin was slow to forget injustice or mockery; but the fire of his father was also in him, and he could be sudden and fierce. Yet he was quick to pity, and the hurts or sadness of living things might move him to tears\". I think that just those sentences made me love him. Tolkien sure had the talent of characterizing his characters in just few sentences. Great influence in the plot are also Beleg, T\u00farin's best friend, who was caught in the web of the curse of H\u00farin's children, and Ni\u00ebnor, T\u00farin's sister, whose fate was destined to destroy T\u00farin. Beleg was actually quite interesting - fantastic warrior, honored by everyone, and loved by everyone. Yet, he starts to love T\u00farin (not in mm kind of way), and does everything he can to make his life easier and good. But even he could not stand the consequences of being in T\u00farin's shadow. Ni\u00ebnor is a lot more younger child then T\u00farin, probably 9 years or 8 (can't remember now), also a second female child (first one being dead) and she stayed with Morwen, their mother - until the time when they will be a part of the curse. The main antagonist would be Glaurung, a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless dragon of fire, whose main purpose was to destroy the lives of H\u00farin's children - to ensure their downfall. Overall: i just think that there should have been part from Silmarillion where it was explained what H\u00farin did after he was released (like i said, that part was in Silmarillion)....There was only one scene near the end. But never mind that, it's fantastic \u2665 btw, those who loved this story should hear the song: \"Harvest of Sorrow\" by Blind guardian, it's about T\u00farin & Ni\u00ebnor...and it's freaking beautiful!
