{"Comments": "Shockingly enough, this may be better than Culver's first novel. Mind you, they are two very different books. This particular book brought tears to my eyes on at least one occasion, and the experimental style was like nothing I've seen before.<---F> Highly reccomended</---F>. <+++>I am an Island</+++> must be a work of art because I'm sure a lot of it went over my head! I read this book over a weekend, and not necessarily because its a quick read, its just hard to put down. It felt like peeking into the mind of this mentally unstable guy.

The main character has agoraphobia and we get to see his day to day life - vegan recipes included - coupled with Jonathan Culver's dark wit. One thing that Culver does not want to do in his stories is extensive detailing of the scene. You won't get a description of how the sun glistened over a spider web or anything like that, he describes the characters actions and you get to fill in the blanks. So in a way, I,<---M> as the reader</---M>, worked my imagination a lot more than if he did give the descriptions. Culver suggests certain songs to be played when you're reading certain scenes. I tried to do it, but couldn't concentrate on the reading, so I stopped. And Mr. Culver, I didn't want to purchase those songs since I don't like that type of music, but didn't download them illegally either...YouTube to the rescue! I am an Island is written in an experimental way and by this I mean not only how the words are written, but also the typographic layout of the book. I highly recommend reading this book in its printed form - I bought my copy at Lulu.com - not sure how it would look digitally. I'm glad I have the printed version because I know I will be reading this book more than once. I'm very sure I'll be able to find things I missed my first time around. ...more<---C>Jonathan Culver</---C>", "Title": "I am an Island"},
