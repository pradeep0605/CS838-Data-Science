{"Comments": "I can't handle how amazing this series is. <---A>Brandon Sanderson</---A> continues to overwhelm me with his impressive storytelling skills. Just like in The Final Empire, the world and the characters and the story were all beyond fantastic.

In fact, most of the time, my review is pretty much written by the time I finish the book, I just need to make slight alterations to account for any last minute goings on. And I like that, b/c your average fantasy is 2 - 3x longer than any other book. Trying to go back after the fact and recall all the key details would be a nightmare. BUT. Brandon Sanderson has consistently thwarted me in this area. And by consistently, I mean every, single time. Why do you hate me, Mr. Sanderson? WHY?! If I were to rate a Sanderson book--any Sanderson book--prior to the last 20%, almost all of them would hover around the 3.0 star range. But unlike most books that benefit from higher ratings b/c OMG, THAT ENDING!, my experience with Sanderson has been very different. Yes, there is definitely an element of OMG and FEELS overwhelming your brain stem, making you instantly forget whatever had you feeling so MEH for the majority of the book, but that's only one small aspect of the turnaround. I'll get to the greater part in a minute. I've called Sanderson a master of misdirection several times, but I'm finding it to be especially true in this first MISTBORN trilogy. You know what happened last time . . . This time . . . it wasn't quite as drastic, but it had a greater impact on my overall reaction to the book. B/c initially, I didn't much like this one. We know from THE FINAL EMPIRE that the Well of Ascension is where the shit went down. The Lord Ruler traveled to the mountains of Terris as prophecy dictated to seize its power and defeat the Deepness . . . A power that wasn't meant to be contained but released, and in selfishly keeping that power to serve his own purposes, the Lord Ruler became the new Evil. With his death the Deepness is returning. His ominous last words proved truthful, and whatever had been holding it back is now absent. Strange shapes take insubstantial form and stalk the Mist by night, and by day . . . no longer banished by light, the Mist attacks and kills defenseless villagers. And Vin is drawn by a distant thrumming, a constant drum beat in the distance that only she can hear . . . calling her to the Well. You'd think that a journey across a land filled with various and dangerous threats would make for an excellent second installment, and it would have . . . if the book had been about a journey across a land filled with various and dangerous threats. But it wasn't. It was about about a city besieged by not one, not two, but THREE armies, one full of the remnants of one of the Lord Ruler's monstrous creations. It was about a naive manboy who needed to lose the boy and become a king. It was about a insecure girl who loves Manboy, but thinks he deserves far better than her. It was about grasping factions in a fledgling government and political scheming and backstabbing, and while that may sound marvelous in theory . . . After roughly 600 pages, it's dreadfully dull. Especially after an action-packed first installment, which brings up another complaint . . . This is the second time I've encountered a lackluster sequel in a Sanderson series, so while I'm not 100% that it's a pattern, it is 2:2 which dramatically increases the likelihood . . . It goes like this: Book 1 - first 80% can be slow and consists primarily of misdirection, false trails, etc. leading to the brilliant chaos of the last 20%. World-building and character development are typically enough to keep you engaged. Book 2 - favors political scheming over action, lots of agonizing(<---B>ly boring</---B>) soul searching, angst-fueled love triangle, and above all else, miscommunication and refusal to confront emotional problems directly. If this is a pattern, Mr. Sanderson, you need to break it. Sooners rather than laters, baby. But despite my annoyance with the lack of progress towards the ultimate goal being somewhat neutralized by last minute revelations (which, by the way, is as frustrating as it is gratifying), those revelations cannot mitigate how completely over I was the Vin/Elend relationship drama. Part of me feels like it would've been more honest to call this book: I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH, HE'S GOING TO LEAVE ME, WHEN WILL HE LEAVE ME?, HE'S GOING TO LEAVE ME. Long, I know. Probably one of the many reasons they went with something else. But it would have been more accurate than THE WELL OF ASCENSION. And as I said, this is the second time Sanderson has done this to us. I'm baffled. This kind of teen-angsty melodrama has no place in adult high fantasy. NONE. But, also again, a handful of new characters (Zane and Tindwyl) and careful threading of impossible-to-detect-foundations for later plot twists kept it from being a total loss. (view spoiler) [Kind of difficult to stay angry about the lack of journey, when a journey isn't actually necessary. Not to mention that whatever Vin let loose from the Well apparently manipulated the whole prophecy into existence to orchestrate its release . . . Seriously, where does he come up with this stuff? (hide spoiler) ] <------If there had been just slightly less drama, those things alone would have made this a strong 4.0 star read for me. BUT. Drama. Recommended with qualifications. Book 3 is up next, so I'll let you know how it goes. 8/26/15: BUDDY READ with my peeps in Sanctum of Fantasy .

This proved that the generic plot of the first book was, in fact, a mere illusion. Nothing is as straightforward as it looks in this world. The survivors must work together The Empire is in complete turmoil. Despite the Lord Ruler's tyranny, he did keep the empire together. With him gone there is no anchor; there is no fear: there is only chaos. Vin and Ellen must attempt to keep the city from descending into complete anarchy. This is no easy task because without the ultimate symbol of power, others will come to take advantage. The threat of three invading armies suddenly dawns on them. They have no real defence; they have no solid army. All they have is their wits and a group of charismatic rogues to save the day. And, if that threat wasn\u2019t enough, the shadow of a deeper enemy approaches. \"That's the point, isn't it? We have to live on, no matter how hard it gets. We'll win in the end.\" The plot turns and alliances twist, factions form and breakdown, whilst more questions are raised as to the origins of the Lord Ruler. What power did he have to keep the people in line? Why is this shadow only approaching now with his demise? Surely, if he kept this evil at bay, he may not have been pure evil? Well, that is what some of the characters begin to realise; they begin to see that his reign of terror may have been for a purpose. And, in this, resides my true reverence of this series. Sanderson has disguised his novels; he made the story initially look basic, in which it harboured the same tired old plot with seen several times since The Lord of the Rings. Then, he slowly reveals what is actually happening, and at the same time shocked me to the core. The awesome, awesome, characters Although this book is a little slow, in places, it\u2019s still fantastic. The character development throughout this series is almost explosive. In this novel Vin has become so much more than she initially was. Her training with Kelisar was merely the beginnings in her exploration of her capabilities; her battle with the Lord Ruler changed her; she has become more powerful and confident; she knows how to wield her powers in new and interesting ways: she knows how to kill, and how to do it well. In this, she has become the leader Kelisar\u2019s rogues. She has filled the gap he left behind. And, in addition, what happens to the bookish Ellen, at the end of the novel, changes a lot of things. \"Elend: I kind of lost track of time\u2026 Breeze: For two hours? Elend: There were books involved.\" He\u2019s a little more that the book reading leader of the city now, I\u2019ll say no more, but I really didn\u2019t see THAT coming. This is such a great series that never fails to surprise me, as soon as I begin to predict the plot I should know that something else entirely is going to happen. But, I\u2019ll keep trying anyway. \u201cThere's always another secret.' -Kelsier\u201d The Mistborn Series 1. The Final Empire - A misty four stars 2.

Okay, everyone just read this series, okay? okay. I feel here as if I ought to apologize to my friends who love these books.

Not only their lives but their conversations, their internal struggles, their dietary preferences...the kind of clothes they like, on and on and on. I found myself slowly getting involved in the story but then we'd hit a spot where we had to go through an internal dialogue concerning doubts, paranoia...or possibly psychosis (\"no one will ever stay with you, everyone will leave you\". This should have been followed by a \"bwa-ha-ha\" when it popped into Vin's mind). When I was reading as I said I was mildly interested but when I'd laid the book aside I didn't think about it. I was hard pressed to get back to it there were just things I'd rather read. I finely got \"re-interested\" about the end of part three as the story of the throne moved on and plots started to come to light only to get thrown back into (view spoiler) [ \"Oh why did he have to see me burst that guy's head...boo hoo hoo. Oh! he flinched when I touched him, oh boo hoo hoo...[no one will ever stay with you Vin, everyone will leave you Vin!]..see Mistborn: The Final Empire for a full explanation.] (hide spoiler) ] So in the end, two stars for my recognition of the writer's ability and the story telling I can see buried under what seems to me a lot of excess verbiage. If it's your cup of tea enjoy. I doubt I'll finish the trilogy. I mean how many 800+ page tomes do we need? Don't get me wrong, I love a good long epic fantasy, it's just that so often any more, people choose to tell a story in 1000 pages that could be told in 250. My opinion throughout of course. ...more This book was...not very good. I absolutely loved the first book, it was sooo good! I still love the magical device he uses, but honestly this book did not live up to the first. The main character becomes pretty stupid, and the love interest was never that interesting. I will read the third book, but my hopes are not high. I have only one word for this and it is: #nope. This was the most insufferably tedious book of my life. And duuuude, I loved The Final Empire ! It was exciting and had a con artist thing going on and magical wizard people with an epic magic system. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SEQUEL. I went from adoring Sanderson to probably never trying a book by him again. Excuse me. I kind of need to walk into a brick wall and scream a little because I am so 100000% done with this this beast. A BRIEF LIST OF WHY I AM A I have only one word for this and it is: #nope. This was the most insufferably tedious book of my life. And duuuude, I loved The Final Empire !

I went from adoring Sanderson to probably never trying a book by him again. Excuse me. I kind of need to walk into a brick wall and scream a little because I am so 100000% done with this this beast. A BRIEF LIST OF WHY I AM AN ANGRY GRAPE: \u2022 It was frikkin' boring. And I mean, absolutely desperately boring, to the point where like TWO SCENES ever happened: Elend having long political discussions + Vin punching people. Over and over and over again. \u2022 Nothing happened in the first 500 pages except TALKING. #bored \u2022 Vin turned into a weeping willow. Like the actual tree. Except at least a tree doesn't spend so much time whining. Where is the epic wizard we had in book 1???? She spent all her time fussing over Elend, disbelieving that he loved her, wishing he could take care of himself...and then when he did grow a backbone SHE GOT OFFENDED THAT HE DIDN'T NEED HER ANYMORE. \u2022 Stahp, please, woman. Please. I couldn't stand Vin and this breaks my heart because I used to adore her?? \u2022 Elend was a small spot of interest. He had A+ character development, but he also was a soft little squidgy pudding with a heart of gold and, well, I am not. It was tedious (for me) just reading about him continually being like \"OMG I WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE POLITICS OMG WHY ARE THEY REJECTING ME\". \u2022 Pages and pages and pages of tedious meetings. Like let's discuss politics. Again, and again. Let's come to no conclusions. Let's all contradict each other for lols. Let's never agree because, again, looooool. \u2022 The small bright spot was Zane, a new mistborn character. Who was \"crazy\" and like this ANNOYED ME SO MUCH because his only personality trait was that he's \"crazy\". That's insulting. I don't know if he had schizophrenia (he heard \"God\" telling him to kill people?) but please stop lumping people with mental illness into this \"we have no personality, just craziness\" trope because it's harmful. (view spoiler) [ And then Zane died anyway and so did my interest. (hide spoiler) ] \u2022 Did I mention the word TEDIOUS yet? Because NOTHING was fREAKING HAPPENING. \u2022 I maybe skimmed. Fight me. \u2022 Why didn't the orcs eat everyone? Oh excuse me, the koloss . But still. That would've made everything so much more fun. \u2022 Also it has the SAME plot as Steelheart. Okay, granted, this came first, but it bothers me when an author can have two seperate series and they have the same plot?? Book 1: take down an evil overlord. Book 2: have a panic attack because the world can't function economically without evil overlord. Book 3: be a hot mess. (Okay idek if the next Mistborn books will be a hot mess because I will not be eating them.) \u2022 ALSO IT WAS SO SEXIST. Elend refuses to spar with Vin so he \"doesn't lose to a girl\" and therefore lose the last of his dignity. There was only ONE FEMALE (Vin) for the first half of the book, and then the second female was just a servant type anyway. Males everywhere. Males blotting out the sun. God rest their souls (please, like, rest 'em). Vin being given grief for not \"dressing like a female\" because you can't be feminine in pants, apparently. LiKE THE LIST GOES ON AND I'M SICK OF IT. \u2022 Why did the fight scenes have to be 9 chapters long?? Because you know what makes a fight scene fun and exciting? WHEN IT MOVES FAST AND IS SHORT AND QUICK. If I have to read another detailed account about how another coin flips in the air, I'm going to flip a table. \u2022 I am asleep. Ugh. I'M DONE. SO VERY DONE. 5000% DONE. I have no malice towards anyone who loves this series. GOOD ON YOU. I wish I had to, because I generally adore fantasy. But this, for me, was slow and tediously detailed, the characters were clingy and petulant (I've read books about teenagers who are more mature than these adults), and 700+ pages of people JUST TALKING is enough to make me fling my brain into the sun and go take up herding sheep in iceland instead of reading. ...more This nearly destroyed me and I absolutely loved it. See my full discussion (with GIFs :P) at www.priceiswong.com I'm continually impressed with Brandon Sanderson, and I appreciate the subtle (at least to me) morality in his books. As most people who read his books will know, Sanderson comes from a Mormon background, and I think this only enhances his ability and perspective as a writer.

His characters are believable, the magic system continues to be impressive, and it is paced well. Regardless of the arguments - Brandon Sanderson is a very good writer. His magic system is original and very, very well thought-out. I recommend the first two books of the Mistborn trilogy to anyone - whether or not you're a fantasy genre fan. Not only are his books fast and fun reading, but they are thought provoking and deep. Just like other landmark series in the sci-fi and fantasy genres, I believe this trilogy will be enjoyed for generations to come. ...more This is That Book. You know the one.

And here - here is a book that deserves every one of its nearly 600 pages. Here is a book with no superfluous sub-plots. Here is a book with no cardboard characters. Here is a series where people grow, change, and generally act like human beings. Here is the perfect mixing of philosophy, action, creativity, and heart. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't think I'll ever be able to fully express how in awe I am of this book. From this point on, this review will contain spoilers for the first of the series, Mistborn: The Final Empire . The story starts grimly. Yes, the Lord Ruler is dead, but that doesn't mean everything is fixed: his empire was a large one, and our heroes are only able to affect small parts of it at a time. Add to that the fact that they've lost their brilliant, charismatic leader and good friend, and it seems the situation is dire. Yet... they've learned something from Kelsier: they laugh in the face of danger. Take, for example, this exchange: Elend looked over at him. \"The Assembly is a mess, a half-dozen warlords with superior armies are breathing down my neck, barely a month passes without someone sending assassins to kill me, and the woman I love is slowly driving me insane.\" Vin snorted at this last part. \"Oh, is that all?\" Ham said. \"See? It's not so bad after all. I mean, we could be facing and immortal god and his all-powerful priests instead.\" They are still the witty, intelligent, compelling heroes we've always rooted for. Or are they? One of the several reasons I think this book is actually better than The Final Empire is that while that one focused primarily on Vin's character development and personal problems, this one expands upon the psyches of the entire cast. Part of the way it does this is through shifting the focus of the third-person limited point of view, so at some point the reader gets to see the thoughts of almost every character. (This is used really brilliantly; more about it later.) The other part is by showing Vin's understanding of others growing; as she develops more sensitivity, she has more insight into their characters. We see the soft heart beneath Clubs' tough exterior, the insecure young man that Spook has become despite his bravado, Ham's pain at being separated from his family, Breeze's devotion to the crew underneath his mercenary attitude. Most of all, we see the troubles of Vin, Elend, and Sazed. Vin has always been a complex girl. The abuse she suffered from her brother, Reen, made it so difficult for her to learn to trust, and even learning that Reen protected her with his last breath hasn't done much for her wary attitude. She still has the potent, niggling fear of abandonment in all of her relationships and so her emotional state is very, very fragile. One of the things I love about her is that she isn't a confident heroine leaking ambition and drive from her very pores. Indeed, her insecurities and doubts are some of what make her so easy to identify with. For a male author, Sanderson does an incredible job portraying what it's like to be a young woman - better, I think, than many female authors do. There is that tenuous balance between wanting to seem self-assured and wanting to be reassured which is highlighted beautifully in Vin's struggles in this book. Her doubts about her relationship with Elend could have seemed superficial, another New Moon-esque created crisis designed to show how much they luuuuuurve each other. Instead, they sprang from very reasonable places, and best of all... they weren't isolated . Like all the characters in this book, Vin interacts with her world, and so her insecurities come not just from the fact that she doesn't know her place in it but also from the fact that others think they do. Zane thinks she's a tool and an unwitting captive. The skaa think she's something close to a goddess, their holy protector. Ironically, Elend is one of the few people who doesn't seem to have any ideas about what Vin should be or is; he accepts her for herself, and that leaves a void in the pressure around her that she shies away from. She doesn't know what he wants from her, and so she projects what she thinks he wants. He loves me, but he's still a man, Vin thought. How many times have I hurt his pride by being Mistborn while he is simply a normal person? A lesser man would never have fallen in love with me. But, doesn't he deserve a woman that he feels he can protect? A woman who's more like... a woman? Vin pulled down in her chair again, seeking warmth within its plushness. However, it was Elend's study chair, where he read. Didn't he also deserve a woman who shared his interests, one who didn't find reading a chore? A woman with whom he could talk about his brilliant political theories? Haven't we all done this? Especially those of us who are writers as well as readers - you narrate in your head, and that includes imagining what other people are thinking about you. It feeds back into any lingering self-consciousness you may be feeling, and in Vin's case it makes her doubt herself. Elend is dealing with the same sort of problems and also with completely different ones. The Elend we knew in the last book was a young, bookish idealist, which was what made him so endearing. The first time he met Vin he complained about her stealing his reading light, for goodness sakes! He was completely adorkable. Readers like me, who have a thing for the nerdy boys, no doubt wanted to believe that his idealism and intelligence would serve him well in creating a utopia after the fall of the Lord Ruler, but that's not the case at all. The same things that were strengths in the first book, which set Elend apart from the rest of the corrupt nobility, are weaknesses here. He lacks social skills, self-confidence, assertiveness. He is not conniving or commanding. He believes so deeply in the innate goodness of people that it makes him blind to deceit and scheming. And while he is a very good legislator, he isn't really a leader. Yet. Elend's evolution from the young man who doesn't really know what to do with his role in life to responsible adult willing to make the hard choices and a few necessary sacrifices is one of the best parts of this book. This is where we really get into his character. When Elend is under pressure, he really shines: with a little help, he transforms into the king he needs to be just in time to have his kingdom pulled out from underneath him by various political forces. As a direct result, he becomes in a way just as insecure as Vin, and he too projects what he thinks she feels about him. These two are so similar at their cores that watching them dance carefully around each other is both beautiful and painful. Their relationship is not the most passionate thing ever penned, but it is sweet and strong, and they're a couple to root for. This is partly because Sanderson doesn't skimp on telling the readers what they admire and love about each other (are you taking notes, YAPNR authors?) and partly because of the irony, that two such intelligent people should be so clueless about themselves. That, too, is another part of being young, I think. Also, they're sensible about their feelings for one another. One line that made me want to cheer: And a kiss is supposed to make it all right? she thought sullenly, sitting back on a stack of books. Oh Vin, you are so fabulous. How many books have I read where a simple kiss can take the heroine's breath away and make her forget her troubles and all sorts of bullshit like that? Thank you, Brandon Sanderson, for writing about a couple who love each other but don't think what they have is the Be-All and End-All. (view spoiler) [Thank you also for the wedding scene, which was just short of being ridiculous but really seemed to suit Vin. Even if poor Elend was a little nonplussed. (hide spoiler) ] And that brings me to the last of what I would consider the main characters: Sazed. Oh, Sazed. Poor, poor Sazed. You know, I honestly think he got put through the grinder worse than anyone else in this book. Like Elend, he is an idealist, though his idealism is centered more around the idea that people thirst for knowledge and less around political situations. And that idealism is brutally shattered as the book goes on. It starts out bad enough, as we join Sazed traveling skaa communities, trying to teach them about lost religions but confronted at every turn by scenes like this: \"When is the Lord Ruler coming back?\" asked a woman. \"I do not believe that he will,\" Sazed said. \"Why did he abandon us?\" \"It is a time of change,\" Sazed said. \"Perhaps it is also time to learn of other truths, other ways.\" The group of people shuffled quietly. Sazed sighed quietly; these people associated faith with the Steel Ministry and its obligators. Religion wasn't something that skaa worried about - save, perhaps, to avoid it when possible. The Keepers spent a thousand years gathering and memorizing the dying religions of the world, Sazed thought. Who would have thought that now - with the Lord Ruler gone - people wouldn't care enough to want what they'd lost? It is through Sazed's eyes that we see how the rest of the former Final Empire is faring, and it's not going so well. Because he is older and wiser than Vin and Elend, he perceives more, and there is a sense of desperation to his narrative that only grows over the course of the book. The final battle absolutely destroys him, but it is the epilogue that stands out most to me, because I cannot imagine seeing that scene - when belief completely collapses and horror and despair set in - through anyone's eyes but the man who wants to be a priest of all religions. It shakes the very foundations of the world, but it shakes the reader because of its effect on Sazed. I'm almost scared to see what happens to him as a result of that revelation. Remember the quotes from the logbook that headed every chapter of The Final Empire? There are quotes here, too, and they are definitely a highlight of the book. The journey of the Hero of Ages to the Well of Ascension is shrouded in mystery, and they cast a little more light on who he was and what happened in those last days. They also mirror some of the events of the climax in a way that heightens the tension to almost unbelievable levels. The resonance between the events of a thousand years previously and the events of the book is a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled writer, and Sanderson is definitely that. (view spoiler) [There is an incredible moment when I realized that the Lord Ruler was actually far more well-intentioned than he seemed, and I was almost sorry that he died because his character has more depth in retrospect than I had ever imagined. I love that Sanderson managed to humanize him not once but twice - the first time through Alendi's logbook, which seemed like it was his until the very end, and the second time in the moment that it becomes clear that he made his most important choice for the greater good. Sure, it didn't turn out so well, but he was a flawed human being after all, and by the end of this book he's almost cast in a better light than Vin. His flaws might have resulted in a thousand years of oppression for the skaa, but her flaws led her to release a force of evil on the world. (hide spoiler) ] The shifting narration really served the scope of the story well. I particularly liked the sections from Breeze's point of view. Since he's a Soother, he has a good understanding of people and emotions, and the subtle way he manipulates situations to go the way he wants is very interesting. Also compelling is the loyalty he feels to the crew, which I hadn't really expected from him but which makes a lot of sense in hindsight. His viewpoint is the one Sanderson calls on when he needs to show emotions of someone other than the POV character, and it works beautifully. With other authors and other series, this might seem like stepping out of the form of third-person limited narration; here it's perfectly logical. A few other things I liked: Tindwyl, the Terriswoman Keeper who instructed Elend in how to behave like a king. She reminded me of a cross between McGonagall and Lord Wyldon (of Harry Potter and The Protector Of The Small, respectively) and I really enjoyed having her around. While her relationship with Elend was interesting, it was her relationship with Sazed that I was really invested in; it was a great insight into Sazed and into the society of the Keepers. (view spoiler) [I knew from the moment they admitted they loved each other that one of them - or both - was going to die. Damn authors. The good ones have that habit, I think, of making sure you adore the characters RIGHT BEFORE THEY KILL THEM OFF. Hiromu Arakawa, I AM LOOKING AT YOU. (hide spoiler) ] Allrianne, who I at first disliked for her attitude and her Valley Girl way of speaking. (No, really. She literally says \"Like, I saw my father's camp.\" FACEPALM.) No spoilers, but there's more to her than what we see on the surface, and I'm interested to see what she gets up to in the next book. Poor Breeze. He has no idea what he's gotten into. The interplay of numerous sub-plots was very graceful, even though some of them have yet to come to fruition. Also, though this book sort of has a cliffhanger, it also has a denouement. I'm not really sure how that worked, but it did. OreSeur, the kandra. Once Vin started being nice to him, their interactions were just... pure gold. No spoilers, but there was a Certain Scene that hit like a punch in the gut as a result. I'm iffy on Zane; he seemed a little forced at times, but in the end his role in the plot was decent. What really interests me was something revealed only near the end, which hopefully will be expanded upon in The Hero Of Ages. (view spoiler) [He mentioned a spike sticking out of his back, like the one placed in Steel Inquisitors. Was that the source of his false insanity? If so, does that explain <---C>Marsh</---C>'s actions? And is it tied to the force from the Well? (hide spoiler) ] Suffice it to say that this tidbit sent me off into a bout of theorizing. Whovians, there's about as much material here for pondering as there's been in Series 6 to date. The world of the Mistborn series is pretty damn complicated. To finish up, a couple good quotes: Personally, Vin didn't find the library's location nearly as amusing as its contents. Or, rather, lack thereof. Though the room was lined with shelves, nearly all of them showed signs of having been pillaged by Elend. The rows of books lay pocked by forlorn empty spots, their companions taken away one by one, as if Elend were a predator, slowly whittling down a herd. (Pg. 301) \"Sazed, I've raised some fifteen daughters,\" Tindwyl said, entering the room. \" No teenage girl is stable. Some are just better at hiding it than others.\" (Pg. 426) Sanderson still has one writing habit that annoys me: he puts a comma after every 'but', even when it doesn't seem to suit the sentence. And of course there are places where the same word is used too quickly in succession. I'm not too bothered by that, though, because come on - the book is almost 600 pages long. It's not going to be linguistically flawless. That's fine. As long as it's still an engrossing read (check), one that makes me think a lot (check), full of surprises (check) and identifiable characters (check), I'm happy. This book, and this series: highly recommended . If you haven't read them yet, you owe it to yourself. Don't worry about the size; once you get into them, they go by fast - sometimes faster than you'd want them to. And finally... I don't think live-action techniques can do justice to it just yet, but Mistborn would make an absolutely mind-blowing anime. (Maybe it could go live-action in future. CG is getting pretty good, after all. But I think anime could get away with a lot more voice-over internal narration, which would be crucial.) ...more <+++>The Well of Ascension</+++> genres are fantasy and sci-fi. The Well of Ascension is a very different book than The Final Empire but I am enjoyed reading it. This book has focused little bit Elend Venture, more insecurities of Vin and it has introduced a new character Zane. It is a stupendous sequel. I find this book intrigues and mysterious same as The Final Empire. I love this book so much Alhamdulillah! 4.5/5 stars. Oh man. OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN THIS BOOK. I definitely did not see foreshadowing happen this time because I DIDNT SEE THAT COMING. Still love Elend. Still love Vin. Still love Sazed.

It was a different book from Mistborn, slower, less POW! (At least on the surface), but I've been in a kind of political, economical, judicial, legislative, informational place in my head lately, and this book was all of those things, as well as awesome and exciting and tense. Did I mention this was tense? Because it is. One thing did leave me wondering though. Maybe this will be explained in Hero of Ages (which I've already started), I'm not sure... **CAUTION** This is a MAJOR spoiler. Click at your own risk. (view spoiler) [I don't understand how TenSoon replaced OreSeur as Vin's kandra... Did OreSeur die? I think he must have, but then I wonder how TenSoon could have killed him when I thought it was against his Contract to do harm -- or is that only to humans? Or, did Zane know the kandra's secret and use it to somehow kill OreSeur? I don't really understand that part. I get that the bones were a decoy, but I guess I don't get kandra/kandra interactions when one is under Contract to do harm to another... how does that work? (hide spoiler) ] Anyway.

I will not go into any lenghty description of the story and the characters, as that would certainly include spoilers for the first volume in the series, and I've also covered the setting in my review of that book. Let it suffice to say that The Well of Ascension is a great fantasy novel. It seems to suffer slightly from the infamous second book syndrome, and it lacks a lot of the aspects which made the first book so brilliant. The story is not as appealing, the characters are not as interesting, and the antagonists are not as mysterious as they were in The Final Empire . But there are a couple of great twists, a handful of new characters, and the ending is absolutely excellent , leaving the reader eager to jump into the last book in the trilogy, The Hero of Ages . And ultimately, this book is a wonderful addition to an amazing series. ...more So this was still a great read but i just couldn't bring myself to love it as much as Mistborn: The Final Empire! *cries*.

Plot: The plot was by far the strongest point of the novel. I was just so engrossed in all of the political conversations happening here. I like my high fantasy heavy on the political intrigue with dashes of cunning & betrayal. Plus the last little bit of this story just blew my fucking mind. Sanderson has no mercy when it comes to plot twists. He'll drag you through the ashes of your favorite characters. He'll throw you out of the airplane and shout \"Plot twist! I cut holes in your parachute, bitch!\" It was crazy! But I enjoyed every minute of this plot as it unfolded. Character Development: I feel as though Vin is the only character that really grew at all in this novel. There is an argument to be made for both Sazed and Elend, as they do make some strides forward, but most of the development primarily revolved around Vin. For me, I wanted a little more in this area. I feel like everyone else was static and that didn't really do much for my reading experience. I'm very glad though for all that Vin underwent in this novel because I really wasn't that fond of her in The Final Empire , and so this really helped me sympathize with and understand her as an individual. Pace: The pace was just a little bit slow in some places for me. As you may or may not know, I'm not normally very bothered by a slow pace. Like we have to be almost moving backwards before I notice anything is amiss. However, there were just a few parts here that dragged a bit longer than I found necessary. Overall though, I didn't much mind the pace. It's methodical, it's well done, and most of the information presented here is necessary. I'm very excited to start the final book in this trilogy.

This series is blowing my mind and I am loving every moment of it. ay noluyo be. After finishing The Final Empire (Mistborn, #1) I wrote in my review that I had no idea why Brandon Sanderson didn't leave the story there (with a perfect conclusion), but instead decided to create a trilogy, risking to \"degrade\" the whole plot. Unfortunately, I was proved right. The Well of Ascension was a poor sequel. To begin with, there was zero development in the supporting characters. They all seemed flat, written in the same voice, and a carbon of each other. I had trouble even distinguish After finishing The Final Empire (Mistborn, #1) I wrote in my review that I had no idea why Brandon Sanderson didn't leave the story there (with a perfect conclusion), but instead decided to create a trilogy, risking to \"degrade\" the whole plot. Unfortunately, I was proved right. The Well of Ascension was a poor sequel. To begin with, there was zero development in the supporting characters. They all seemed flat, written in the same voice, and a carbon of each other. I had trouble even distinguishing the crew members (for example Ham and Clubs). There were a lot of old-school fantasy cliches, easy to predict and without offering any surprise (view spoiler) [ The Kendra being none of the crew members, Vin eventually choosing Elend and fighting/killing Zane & Straff while sparing Cett, etc (hide spoiler) ] . Finally, more than 100 pages have been spend in boring and repetitive topics, such as how Kelsier inspired the crew members to keep fighting, how Vin loved Elend but believed she didn't deserved him (and vice versa), and so on. \u201cAt first glance, the key and the lock it fits may seem very different,\" Sazed said. \"Different in shape, different in function, different in design. The man who looks at them without knowledge of their true nature might think them opposites, for one is meant to open, and the other to keep closed. Yet, upon closer examination he might see that without one, the other becomes useless. The wise man then sees that both lock and key were created for the same purpose.\u201d All in all, if you really want to know what happens next in The Final Empire, and want to follow Vin's tale, you should read the book. But if you really loved the first book, and found it perfect as an individual story, I would suggest skipping the rest (although i'll have to finish the trilogy before offering a complete and unbiased opinion). I found only 3 positive reasons to read The Well of Ascension, first being the well described and exciting battles (though with predictable results), second being the world building (though it was simply expanded from the 1st book), and the tension (yearning to learn what happens next) being the final.

Elend smiled, stacking up the books on his table. \"You don't like anyone when you first meet them, Vin.\" \"I liked you.\" \"Thereby demonstrating that you are a terrible judge of character.\" Weeeellll peeps, it's official. I am in love with Brandon Sanderson. It isn't simply because he has some of the most unforgiving battle scenes ever, and it isn't because his books make me laugh more than they probably should Vin frowned, then glanced at Elend. He seemed...distracted. \"I don't like her,\" she said.

I am in love with Brandon Sanderson. It isn't simply because he has some of the most unforgiving battle scenes ever, and it isn't because his books make me laugh more than they probably should, though those are great big bonuses-humor in such a long story is so refreshing, don't you think? No, I love Sanderson because, despite how many characters we have to follow throughout the whole story, he makes me fall in love with all of them. Not just the good guys or the middle guys or the sidekicks-I fall in love with those characters you can't be sure are loyal or that are bound to betray you. I fall in love with each and every moment all these mismatched friends share. And, most importantly, I fall in love with the stories he weaves. Ham turned back, still smiling. \"You make it sound so desperate, El.\" Elend looked over at him. \"The Assembly is a mess, a half-dozen warlords with superior armies are breathing down my neck, barely a month passes without someone sending assassins to kill me, and the woman I love is slowly driving me insane.\" Vin snorted at this last part. Again, I get so nervous every time I pick up a fantasy novel. I repeat it so much that it has to be annoying, but I just am so picky about what I read-especially with fantasy. So, while I adored the last book (I gave it a 4), I still didn't label it as a favorite. Why? Well, it's simple-I was a tad overwhelmed. It's a lot to take in when you never really read anything this long or complex. There was a lot to learn and a lot of people to keep track of-and, simply, I'm a newb. I don't read this stuff often because I do like a simpler story-sue me. But, even with all the difficulty of the first, I found so many things to love and obsess over: Elend, for instance. Vin. Elend and Vin. They were absolutely precious together. And then there was Kelsier and Breeze and Spook. I loved them all. I loved the action and the bonding scenes-it was a stupendous story. But in this book? Oh yeah. There was literally nothing I couldn't handle. I knew it all, ya know?? So, instead of all that learning and world-building, we got a full-fledged story!! I was ecstatic. It started out with a bang-Vin in the mists doing what she does best. But even better than that??? Elend. Elend on every freaking page-if not physically, then spiritually when they would mention him and his plans for the kingdom. Did I mention my dear, dear Elend was King?? Well, he is. And that's one of the best parts of this story-it's so flawed!! Or, at least, the characters are. \"But you had others before her,\" Spook said. \"Noble girls.\" \"A couple,\" Elend admitted. \"Though Vin has a habit of killing off her competition,\" Ham quipped. Elend laughed. \"Now, see, she only did that once. And I think Shan deserved it-she was, after all, trying to assassinate me at the time.\" He looked down fondly, eyeing Vin. \"Though, I do have to admit, Vin is a bit hard on other women. With her around, everybody else looks bland by comparison.\" Elend is still, as ever, in love with Vin. But he also has a kingdom to watch over and keep from being taken over. Such a huge task for someone who is so pure, so good. And here is the problem: Elend is so invested in making a fair government, he doesn't see or, presumably, care. He wants to be good to his people. He doesn't want to be a dictator like the Lord Ruler and oppress his people like that evil man did. But there's a fine line, and we get to see his journey throughout the book on whether it's worth becoming a man he doesn't want to be so he can keep his crown or whether his wits and cunning can keep his kingdom safe-but possibly lose his rule for doing the right and fair thing. \"My dear man,\" Breeze noted. \"When you told us you needed to 'go and gather a few important references,' you might have warned us that you were planning to be gone for two full hours.\" \"Yes, well,\" Elend said, \"I kind of lost track of time...\" \"For two hours?\" Elend nodded sheepishly. \"There were books involved.\" Elend is a character I could go on and on and on about. He's sweet, kind, caring, and would do anything for Vin-and his kingdom. And that's why he's such an amazing and loyal character. He's shy and unsure of himself, he doesn't see how Vin could love a man like him when they are so different-And here is another plot I'll mention later. But, with Vin by his side, he brings all the con-men into his inner circle and together they strategize and try to do what's best for the kingdom....it's quite hilarious to see all these completely different men try to figure out a cohesive way to mix all their ideas together. \"Do you know what I hate, kandra?\" she whispered, falling to a crouch, checking her knives and metals. \"No, Mistress.\" She turned, meeting OreSeur's eyes. \"I hate being afraid.\" And then, Vin. Wonderful, un-trusting, insecure little Vin. She is their Mistborn now, so she watches over Elend and the welfare of the kingdom. She works herself to the bone because she knows if she slips up even once, Elend will be killed and it will be all her fault. Except it won't...but she feels that way. And more often than not, lately, she has been experiencing doubts about her and Elend. He's too good for her, he'd never be happy with someone so different....and she couldn't be more wrong. He adores her and would never abandon her like everyone else in her life has before-but it doesn't stop her from being terrified about such things, anyway. See the problem, though? They both are on that same path, worrying that they aren't good (or good enough) for each other....let the misconceptions commence. The study's small ventilation window bumped open, and Vin squeezed through, pulling in a puff of mist behind her. She closed the window, then surveyed the room. \"More?\" She asked incredulously. \"You found more books?\" \"Of course,\" Elend said. \"How many of those things have people written?\" she asked with exasperation. Elend opened his mouth, then paused as he saw the twinkle in her eye. Finally, he just sighed. \"You're hopeless,\" he said, turning back to his letters. And now there are new threats to the city-someone, presumably another Mistborn, is following her. At every turn she senses a dark figure standing menacingly above her on the rooftops, but he never makes a move. And every time she tries to chase him, she loses him. There are worse things, though. Now the mists are spreading into the daytime, seeping out from the night. And, more than that, the mists are producing palpable shapes that resemble something...sinister. And Vin feels it. When she attacks one, it numbs her arm causing shock she never could have imagined...and to top it all off?? Two armies are waiting outside the gates ready to attack the city, steal the throne.....and execute Elend. Poor Vin. Oh!! And did I mention a spy has infiltrated their inner circle?? But there's no way to know who.... So, to say this book was amazing and tremulous and action-packed would be an understatement-in fact, this book is an understatement. Let me explain-It all unfolds so beautifully, so simply. Every little plot twist builds and builds, both out in the mist with Vin and inside the inner circle with Elend. While it's quiet and strategic with our dear King, things are hectic running around with Vin. Even when we could get bored, we don't. Sanderson interchanges, and mixes, Elend and Vin's problems so seamlessly that you can't get bored. Or I didn't, at least. And then it all comes to a head. It's all that simple. We wait, we wait, we see, we see, and then mix the potion a little and BAM! We have a wonderful 5 star story!! \"And our differences?\" Elend asked. \"At first glance, the key and the lock it fits may seem very different,\" Sazed said. \"Different in shape, different in function, different in design. The man who looks at them without knowledge of their true nature might think them opposites, for one is meant to open, and the other to keep closed. Yet, upon closer examination, he might see that without one, the other becomes useless. The wise man then sees that both lock and key were created for the same purpose.\" I didn't skim. I wasn't bored for even a moment. And this heartbreaking tale tore my heart out more than once. I cried so hard near the end it bordered on hysteria. I didn't think 'ol Sanderson had it in him, frankly. Betrayals and lies, friendship and love, we see this hodge-podge group fight their hardest battle yet-they just thought things were difficult with the Lord Ruler. I am so nervous for book three because there is no way I will come out of this without more than a few tears...but when that time comes, I'll have to be strong. That's all there is to it.

After the death of the Lord Ruler, the world is in chaos. Young Elend Venture has taken control, but he\u2019s young and inexperienced and has a bit of an idealistic way of ruling, which will easily be taken advantage of. Several armies wish to seize power for themselves, resulting in a very tense stalemate, and Luthadel in the middle of an awesome siege. On top of that, Vin is starting to hear drums, and is certain that this has something to do with her massive power. Oh, and there's a little matter of THERE'S A SPY IN OUR MIDST. All in all, it\u2019s got all the ingredients of a really good book. There are the characters we\u2019ve grown to love; Vin, who used to be the underdog, is now kind of awesome; Breeze, who will never cease to jump at the opportunity to sass someone; Sazed, our Keeper of religions, who has to face the anger of another Keeper after bringing the Empire down. Not all of them were as present as I would have liked (*coughBreezecough*), but when they were around, I was not disappointed. I also really liked the relationship between Vin and Elend. I liked how Vin was the superior of the two and Elend didn\u2019t give a damn; I liked how Vin went on killing people in the most awesome and ridiculous ways and Elend didn\u2019t give a damn; I liked how Vin slowly started to lose her mind and Elend didn\u2019t give a damn. He loved and trusted Vin unconditionally, which was really nice to see. You don\u2019t need all the mushy love scenes to understand their relationship. But if they did get a little mushy, it was beautiful: \"When I wear a dress,\" Vin said, \"they expect a lady. Then they're disappointed when they find me instead.\" \"Anyone who would be disappointed to find you is too dense to be of any relevance.\" Then there are the journal logs, usually one paragraph at the beginning of every chapter, where some piece of legend is discussed. This time, it was all about The Well of Ascension, and how the Lord Ruler came to grab the immense power of the Well. There\u2019s also the Hero of Ages, who is supposed to protect the world from complete destruction. These were by far my most favourite parts, as they brought more mystery and intrigue to the table, and I couldn\u2019t wait to discover the answers. However \u2013 and I feel like this is a typical problem with Brandon Sanderson books \u2013 I found this book to be really slow. While Sanderson usually makes up for the slow pace with his impressive world-building and brilliant story, I didn\u2019t quite forgive him this time around. This entire book was basically focussed on the siege. Yes, it did create a lot of tension, and yes, some of the battle scenes were really quite epic, but I didn\u2019t sit down to read these books so I could read 700 pages of battle scenes, and I feel like that\u2019s pretty much what I got. I also started to understand the people who think Vin is a Mary Sue. I don\u2019t completely agree with them, but she did start to annoy me a little bit with just how incredibly awesome she is. Yes, we get it, she is fierce and powerful, but you don\u2019t need to rub it in every single time. Or keep referring to the time when she lived on the streets. We figured after the first ten times. Nevertheless, she was the cause of some pretty epic fight scenes (hur hur, exploding heads), so I can let it slide. Once again, the ending really sets you up for the third book, and you can\u2019t help but put the book down and yell \u201cDAMN YOU SANDERSON\u201d, because you know he\u2019s reined you in for another ride. You can\u2019t finish the book and not wonder what\u2019s going to happen in the next one. He is awesome and you cannot resist. P.S. Bonus points for Zane. ...more Loved it even more than the first one... just read it!! NOW! PS. Can we all agree that Straff is a POS? Ok? Good!

I was THAT ENDING!!!!!!!!!! I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The books keep getting better and better, I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!!!!!!! Luckily, I have the third book so I can start reading ASAP! If you didn't read the first book and you are confused on whether you should read it or not, READ IT! I promise, it is worth it and it is amazing! If you don't know what the series is about or whether you should start reading it, check out my review to the first book, Mistborn: The Final Empire. I was so disgusted by how Straff treated women. It was disgusting he was just so cruel. I hated Straff so much!!!! Whenever I saw his name on the page, I TAKE A DEEEEEP BREATH! If I ever met Straff, it would not be a pleasant meeting. I loved the characters even more now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So much excitement and action it was so intriguing! The plot was amazing and there were so many plot twists. I felt that the new characters in the series were perfect and they fit in nicely with the plot. I couldn't stop reading and I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, whenever I started reading, I had to go somewhere. So I had to postpone my reading to a point where I gave up, and stayed up all night to read. But it was definitely worth it! Sazed seemed like a fatherly figure in my opinion and HE IS JUST SO AMAZING!!!!!!!! I loved how Breeze was giving everyone hope and he is such a good friend! Ham is so funny and I really liked him!!!!!!!! Eland is amazing and so pure! Vin matured so much and she is so much more bolder than before. She grew up and we all experience her change from Mistborn: The Final Empire to The Well of Ascension! Tindwyl was an amazing addition to the crew and I loved how she helped Eland! I loved the bonding moments between Oreseur and Vin, it was so sweet and nice. Clubs and Dockson were also awesome but sometimes I has mixed feelings for characters. At first, when I met Zane, I felt he was okay. I had mixed feelings of what to think of him. But later on, he starting getting me very annoyed and every time Vin went to him, I'm screaming \"VIN DON'T GO NEAR HIM! HE IS SUCH A BAD INFLUENCE!!!!!!!!!!\" I felt that Vin and Eland should have talked to each other about how they felt. They kept thinking that they didn't deserve each other. Both pf them felt that the other deserved more and all. It was funny how Vin asked Sazed for advice and literally after Vin left, Eland came to ask Sazed for advice. SAZED YOU ARE AN AWESOME INFLUENCE AND YOU ARE SUCH A HELPFUL FRIEND! Sazed is so respectful, I just love him for that! While reading, I made a few predictions and most of them were right. So I kinda ruined the plot twist with all my predictions. But although I did, I still loved the book. The world-building was beautiful and Brandon Sanderson did amazing job. I was reading a MASTERPIECE!!!! It was just so good and this book is all I could think of whenever I am doing something important. Every time I read a new book, I keep comparing it to this book. The action scenes were epic and no one could write the action scenes like Brandon Sanderson! These action scenes are one of a kind and you can imagine all the action in your head. When I was reading the fight scenes, I felt as if I were fighting, instead of Vin. When Vin got hurt, I would get hurt and I would get this funny feeling in my stomach. Even though Vin falls, she gets back up and I love that about her! I LOVE YOU VIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so happy to be back in a world that I love. I can't wait to continue on with this amazing series! I don't want this series to end, I want to read more and more and more. When I am finished this series, I am pretty sure I will reread it ASAP! It has fantasy, romance, humor, magic, adventure and suspense! It's crazy how there are so many different things in one book! This book is astounding and believe me, if you didn't read this book yet, you are missing out!
