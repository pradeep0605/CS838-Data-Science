Yes, people who loved Vampire Academy series and are dying to read this book, NOTHING. I wouldn't say I didn't like Bloodlines. It was good but I would point out each and every freaking thing I hated about it.<---F> I am so ashamed</---F>. I don't know why or on whom... but I am ashamed..... FAIL#1 What happened to you Ms. Mead? Do you know why people liked your books? Its because of the KICK ASS heroine. Yes, please notice and think about the word KICK ASS for a minute. I knew it before reading this book that Sydney would not be a fighter or anything but this was so frustrating. I was thinking after reading more than half of the book that when will she actually start fighting or you know do something exciting? It was just like this: 'Protecting Jill-Reminding herself that shes An Alchemist-Protecting Jill' And that sequence went on and on and stopped when only 100 pages were left. I liked Sydney but the author made her so dull, she had no life. Even though she was the main character of this book, Jill took all the fame. FAIL#2 I hate Jill from the core of my heart. So all the Jill fans out there... Please don't read this fail. This book was basically ALL about Jill,<---M> protecting Jill</---M>, loving Jill. UGH! I freaking hate this bitch so much that if she was alive, then I would have shot her or something after reading this book. Why the fuff was everybody attracted to her? EVERYONE?! Tell me one guy, ONE guy who had not fallen in love with her. Because of that dumb bitch, Sydney had no story at all. And WHY ADRIAN WHY?! Do you have be feel sorry for that weirdo? Jill should die. DIE! >.< She always caused trouble, more than half of this book is about her which annoyed me to death, shes just fifteen and attracted like every guy from 18-21... All I want to say is, FAIL#3 I just blame the author. You made every character, which I loved, behave wrong. From Sydney to Eddie, I was like, \"no... noway is Adrian or Eddie like that!\" Because of the characters, I was so sad. Even though Adrian was the only male character who behaved like himself, the rest were changed. As if I never knew them. And when I came to know about Eddie's love interest in the end, My hands were on my face and I was shaking my head in disappointment. FAIL#4 I give Bloodlines an award for the most predictable book ever. When I thought I couldn't get any more disappointed, the author decides to give us such a predictable story, I didn't even have to use my brain. I guess I have read and seen many thriller and mystery books and movies to know that the villain is the least person you suspect. I am reading and reading and reading, and suddenly the book finishes and I am just staring at the freaking wall and being like, \"Thats it?\" FAIL#5 No romance at all. You heard me, NO romance. Not even a tiny bit. I am so shocked. And yes, I will never get to know who is on the cover beside Sydney. I think its Adrian but whatever, I don't even picture Adrian like that anyway. More or maybe 100% like Chace Crawford. xD I was so angry. Poor Sydney. She couldn't even have a tiny bit of romantic thingy with Adrian.  This story was all straight and adventure type. No action. No romance. No cliff hanger. No nothing. *Breaks the brick while Banging my head against the wall but still alive* Now a letter especially for the author Ms. Read Dear Author, (<---B>Cool down Saniya, Cool down!</---B>) Anyway, I would like to tell you that you should write the next book, The Golden Lily much better or else don't be surprised if you see a creepy figure standing outside your bedroom window with a gun. *On my knees* PLEASE! Write the second book nicely PLEASE PLEASE! From your crazy Vampire Academy fan, Saniya. If this book was more about Sydney, more about Adrian and Sydney, more action, more romance and a better cliffhanger... I would have rated this book 4-4.5 stars. I am rating this book 2.5/5 stars (half of the book was bearable) I liked Bloodlines, but these points I mentioned above irritated me alot and I am going to read the next book because of Adrian, Sydney and Eddie. I AM DISAPPOINTED! (and readers who read my review and then comment like \"you are wrong, etc\" Please, why did you even bother reading the whole review. You just see my 2 star rating and go read another review.) ...more LOVED IT! This was the perfect book for me to finally shake off the rest of the reading slumpy feelings that were hanging around. I was surprisingly happy with Sydney's character and I love her banter with Adrian! I can't wait to see where this series is going to go and I need the next book pronto. Definitely recommend if you enjoyed the Vampire Academy series! 118 days, 30 hours, and counting... IT HAS A COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All I have to say is Adrian better be in this series, and he better find someone to love him, or else I'm going to have to jump into the book and make him mine.

It's set in the VA world but will be about different characters: Sydney (our narrator), Jill, Eddie, and one of the love interests from 118 days, 30 hours, and counting...

I'm not saying who that last guy is, but it's mostly to protect those who haven't read Last Sacrifice. If you have read it, then it should be pretty obvious who the other character is. So, clearly, this means it is 100% confirmed that Adrian is in it, so YAY!!! Thank you!!! Also, it sounds to me like it will be in first-person, so I'm not sure why it says otherwise on here, but we shall see! ...more 2.5 out of 5 stars Here's why I normally love <---A>Richelle Mead</---A>.

Always, that is, except in the case of her most recent book, Bloodlines , a new spin-off series from her Vampire Academy books. I've read all thirteen of the author's previous novels, including her adult urban fantasy series Dark Swan and Georgina Kincaid , and I'm sorry to say that I've never before had such a hard time getting into one of her books. Sydney, the main character in Bloodlines , was never all that interesting to me in VA--but if anything, she's even harder to connect with here. Sydney has been maneuvered into a protector/big sister situation with Jill, who has to go in hiding while her sister Queen Vasilissa tries to affect certain changes in court law. The problem starts with the fact that this is a very similar dynamic to the Rose Hathaway/Lissa relationship, and the parallel only serves to remind us how much more interesting and kick-ass Rose was as a heroine. If the shadow of Rose wasn't enough, particularly in how she affects Adrian, she even makes an appearance a few times in person, as if Bloodlines could not stand on its own merits without her. And I'm not sure that it actually can. Sydney is placed in the thankless position of being a stick-in-the-mud \"mom\" figure, constantly chiding Jill for this and Adrian for that. She's also fearful, afraid to take action, cowed by her father and by the authority figure Keith, has severe image problems (she thinks as a size 2, she's too fat compared to the thin vamps around her), she has no social skills (she has no clue when boys are hitting on her and is \"confused\" by why other kids hate her for always volunteering the right answers in class), and if that weren't enough, she's also kind of a racist. Yep, she's terribly suspicious and fearful of vampires and magic in general, which is a pretty big problem when you're totally surrounded by both those things. There are steps taken to show a certain amount of growth and development in her character, but honestly she became so tiresome and uninteresting to me that I really wasn't all that convinced by it. Certainly not enough to care about what happened to her one way or the next. Other problems included a self-centered, whiny Jill (if you thought Lissa was annoying, wait until you spend time with her sister!), three boys who are into Jill (although why there's even one is beyond me), a mopey Adrian (it's incredibly disappointing to see so little meaningful time spent with one of my favorite characters, although he's technically always there), a villain that's all too easy to spot, and above all, supremely uninteresting plots and subplots. Have we really resorted to juvenile \"Oh noes, where is Jill? She's been sneaking out to see her boyfriend!\" and \"Let's switch Jill's P.E. period so she doesn't get burned by the unfriendly sun!\" and \"Sweet heaven, will pretty pretty princess Jill get to participate in the fashion show???\" type plots in the Vampire Academy world? Really? While I did enjoy the small amount of time spent on Sydney's Alchemy skills and the mysterious business of the magic tattoos, there wasn't nearly enough magic, action, emotional arcs, strong characters, or plot development to make this book worthwhile, so it felt very off the mark to me. I will keep reading the series in the hope that it will get better, but this first installment is much less thrilling than it should have been. I am normally such a fan of this author's books, because even when they aren't perfect, they've always had the elements I mentioned above--and I've always found them to be entertaining and fun. But sadly, I can't say that I found Bloodlines to be either one of those things. A big, big disappointment to me, in every conceivable way. Regardless of my feelings about the book, however, my thanks go out to Flannery over at The Readventurer for loaning me her ARC!

Yes, it\u2019s no surprise I\u2019m Team Adrian, and I have been ever since Dimitri uttered in Spirit Bound those sucktastic words I've given up on you. Love fades. Mine has... to Rose. That was gut-punch harsh and difficult to let go no matter his real purpose and ultimate choice. So when Vampire Academy concluded and Adrian was left shattered and rejected, I knew he deserved so much more and the hard lesson that the good guys don\u2019t always win was waved in the faces of Team Adrian fans. But now we\u2019ve got a whole new story to be told and that\u2019s pure EXCITEMENT ! In this first installment of Bloodlines , the story picks up shortly after Vampire Academy ends. I\u2019m thinking about a couple of months or less. The court is in turmoil over Vasilisa Dragomir\u2019s reign as queen and some people want to see her gone. However, rather than striking directly at the target, they go for her sister Jill because by getting rid of her, Lissa will be forced to forfeit her throne. To circumvent this plan of attack, Jill is tucked away at Amberwood Preparatory Academy with a posse of guardians including the Alchemist <---C>Sydney Sage</---C>, the dhampir Eddie and our beloved Adrian. They band together to keep Jill safe and try to move on and build some semblance of a life in the aftermath of VA. I feel Sydney was the perfect choice to narrate this story as the main character. She might not be punk-rock tough like Rose...yet, but you can see her slowly developing from timid, yes-girl to don\u2019t-mess-with-me badass. She has a lot to prove to her people because of her involvement with Rose\u2019s escape. But as the story progresses, she realizes that sometimes she needs to take some risks and make some hard choices to discover the truth and uncover her full potential. Adrian is absolutely perfect in this book. He delivers his ever-smooth performance of carefree slacker, but when you take a closer look it\u2019s obvious he has some recovering to do in the wake of Rose\u2019s ultimate choice. You can clearly see he\u2019s trying to get away from his past and find a purpose for himself. He\u2019s realizing his love for Rose was misguided and begins to take strides to steady himself after the fallout. This book covers some heavy ground by showing how life lessons, character development and unpaid debts are just a few struggles to overcome. The bond between the four main players, Sydney, Eddie, Adrian and Jill is forming and I can\u2019t wait to see where their journey will lead. Great series kick-off that Vampire Academy fans will enjoy! Thank you so much to Alexa for lending me her ARC because she knew I couldn't wait one more day for my Adrian fix. ~HUGS~ XD ...more It was a likable enough read especially with that twist in the ending.

That reduced my total enjoyment of the book, of course- that and the fact that I\u2019m not really a huge fan of vampire books, unless they\u2019re funny or they\u2019re not the main focus of the story. But I\u2019ve been more than 200 pages through the book and still no snorting or grinning except for a few smiles induced by Adrian but that\u2019s it. Sydney\u2019s attempt at humor? \u201cI\u2019d name it Latte, hoping my love of coffee would soon transfer to the car.\u201d (What\u2019d she say?) I also couldn\u2019t care for the characters except for this Adrian guy (I think he\u2019s kinda cute!). I would have liked Sydney enough for being really smart and caring but she\u2019s also a bit self-centered. I just couldn\u2019t love a gal who thinks size four is huge (*rolls eyes*) although I also felt bad for her because the other character, Jill, who gets everybody\u2019s attention took the entire stage from her. It\u2019s as if the story\u2019s really about Jill in the POV of a supporting character, Sydney (poor gal). Overall, it was an okay read, an interesting one but I wasn\u2019t invested enough to continue the rest of the books in the series . Sorry about this lame review, Naomi . I know you loved it and so did many of my friends. Again, it\u2019s just me, not the book. Happy early birthday, my lovely friend. (May 8 is her birthday) For your birthday, I read something I don\u2019t usually read so maybe that counts, right? Lol. Have the most wonderful, inspiring day! <3 P.S. For a more positive review, do check out Pearl's. ...more The short of it: I'm going to offer the unpopular opinion here and say that I enjoyed this book more than some of the VA books (and this is coming from someone who gave all the books three to four stars each). I love Sydney, Adrian, Jill, and Eddie, and I love the chance to learn more about the Alchemists. There has been so much talk about this book in recent months. Those lucky enough to get their hands on ARC\u2019s have seemed to think that Bloodlines isn\u2019t as good as VA and while I do see what they mean, I don\u2019t exactly agree. Going into this book I was sooo excited about it. VA remains one of my all time fave series and I had high expectations for Bloodlines and, for me, it didn\u2019t disappoint. I can see the differences in this and VA, but I loved it none-the-less. The world within this book is very There has been so much talk about this book in recent months. Those lucky enough to get their hands on ARC\u2019s have seemed to think that Bloodlines isn\u2019t as good as VA and while I do see what they mean, I don\u2019t exactly agree. Going into this book I was sooo excited about it. VA remains one of my all time fave series and I had high expectations for Bloodlines and, for me, it didn\u2019t disappoint. I can see the differences in this and VA, but I loved it none-the-less. The world within this book is very different from that in VA. The minor characters in VA now have a larger role and they have the chance to shine. The world within the Amberwood boarding school was quite normal, and the book lacked the Moroi magic found in VA, but I discovered that I actually didn\u2019t mind that. The pace of this book was slower as Richelle Mead set up the characters and storyline, but I enjoyed the pace and everything that happened. It was nice seeing the new characters in this book. After the way the Vampire Academy series ended, there were a lot of questions left unanswered and a lot of loose ends left untied. In Bloodlines those characters whose stories weren\u2019t completed are front and centre and we get the beginning of their own tales. Sydney, Jill and Eddie are all back and their lives are now our focus. I wasn\u2019t sure how I would feel about Sydney. I liked her in Blood Promise and I knew she had promise, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to love her as much as I did. And I did actually love her....a lot. She has her issues and fears in regards to Moroi and vampires, but she\u2019s strong too. One of the things that was a stand out about her for me was her morals. I liked that she still has issues with vampires and still considered them and their world to be evil and unnatural at times, and yet unlike the other alchemists, she treated them with respect and decency; interacting with them in a way that was kind and not unnecessarily cruel. Throughout this book Sydney continued to grow and her ideas change and I think she has the potential to be an incredible heroine as the series continues. Personally I can\u2019t wait to witness her becoming the kind of lead I know she can be. I can\u2019t say enough how much I love Adrian. While Dimitri always had my heart in the previous series and I always wanted him to be with Rose, I\u2019ve always thought highly of Adrian\u2014ever since he appeared in the VA books. He\u2019s such a great character. He\u2019s funny and charming and underneath he\u2019s got such a great heart. There\u2019s so much about him that\u2019s a front and not completely the truth that I adored the moments when his kindness and his true feelings shone through. It\u2019s clear from this book just how much Rose\u2019s betrayal hurt him at the end of Last Sacrifice, but at the same time I could see that he\u2019s ready to move on and that he can be okay again. There\u2019s nothing I want more than him to reach his potential. The relationship he has with Jill is so adorable. He\u2019s always cared about her, but in this book it\u2019s finally clear how strong that affection is. He treats her like a little sister and I don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019d do anything to keep her safe and happy. I can\u2019t deny that Bloodlines lacked the romance that VA did and yet I wasn\u2019t disappointed by this\u2014not in the least. The chemistry is there between Adrian and Sydney and Mead has set up a great stage for what I can foresee being a terrific romance. The seeds have been sown and I\u2019m excited about the prospect of seeing their relationship develop over time. It\u2019s obvious from the way they interact with each other that something really deep could develop between them in future books. While they\u2019re very different in a lot of ways, they\u2019re also very similar and I think they could find strength in themselves from each other. Adrian certainly is charming enough to help change Sydney\u2019s thoughts on Moroi and sweep her off her feet and I can\u2019t defiantly see her helping to heal his broken heart. I cannot wait to see how this relationship changes in the next few books\u2014it\u2019s so exciting. I liked the side story of Jill and Lee, although I saw Eddie and everything he feels coming. I\u2019m eager to see where this leads and what it means. There were enough twists and turns in this book to keep you on your toes and the entire time I was reading I didn\u2019t want to stop. I think there a tonnes of possibilities for the characters in this book and the ending was one that left me wanting more....stat! Bloodlines proves that Mead can indeed keep her VA world alive and has captivated me once again. I think this the start of what looks to be a brilliant series and I for one cannot wait to get my hands on The Golden Lily , although the wait is going to kill me! ...more 4.5 stars - I knew that I would love this book! The Vampire Academy series definitely makes my top 10 favorite list, so naturally I was excited to read on! I wasn't that happy to hear that it would follow Sydney though. Rose was mentioned in the very beginning, but it was very brief. Truthfully, the reason why this wasn't a perfect five star book for me was because I did find parts of this a TAD slower than the VA series. But it definitely wasn't bad and I was interested ALMOST the whole time. I 4.5 stars - I knew that I would love this book!

Truthfully, the reason why this wasn't a perfect five star book for me was because I did find parts of this a TAD slower than the VA series. But it definitely wasn't bad and I was interested ALMOST the whole time. I mean, I read it in like three sittings, so obviously it wasn't a slow book. The only other negative thing I can think of, is Sydney. It's definitely different to go from the fierce, intense Rose to her. The way she dresses and acts. The way she runs and hides when someone does magic... Sometimes she reminded me of a younger Hermione always worrying about the rules. It just made me want to yell at her to relax! haha I DO like that she's so into school though. At least she thinks before she acts! (view spoiler) [ While reading this though, I started to see little changes in her and I think that we'll continue to see changes. Just in this one book she's already had a lot of character development and I was pretty stoked that she finally started standing up for herself a bit and talking back. I'm interested to see what happens between her and her father and sister in the later books. Question, Alchemists try to fit in with humans and keep the knowledge of Vampires a secret, correct? WHY do they get those freaking tattoos on their FACES then?! I understand the purpose of the tattoo itself, but I don't think that the location was ever explained? Maybe it will in the next books. I thought for some reason that only Moroi, Dhampirs, and other Alchemists could see it at first. But nope, apparently the whole school can. I just don't get why they would draw that much attention to themselves. Naturally, one of my favorite parts of this book was Adrian. I absolutely ADORED him in the VA series, and while I was ALL for Rose and Dimitri (I seriously shipped them so hard from book one) I felt so crushed for Adrian at the end of the series. Although he started out smoking and drinking again just like the sad Adrian we'd seen before, he did pull it together a bit by the end. A lot of that was for Jill of course. Oh my gosh! Did you guys guess that they were Spirit Bound?! I can't believe that he saved \"Jailbait's\" life! I was pretty shocked.. Just when we thought we had gotten away from all of that now that Rose and Lissa aren't bound.... So I definitely think that Adrian and Sydney will become friends. They kind of already have. They may become more :D I really hope so. I feel kinda sad for Sydney because it's brought up a lot that she's never really loved anyone before... Then of course I'd love to see Adrian find someone else to help him heal and get over Rose... I think it's going to be really interesting to see what happens between Adrian and his new partner, Dimitri, in the Golden Lily! I'll admit, I kind of screamed when I saw his name at the end. I freaking love that man <3 I never cared for Lee that much, and I was worried something might be a little off about him. Like I thought maybe HE was the vampire hunter or something crazy like that since he kept trying to get his father to think they weren't real. Which, I guess we realized at the end that they are in fact NOT real, as far as we know. The enemies in this book turned out just to be Strigoi (as usual), a former Strigoi, and then a twisted Alchemist. Which he definitely got what was coming to him in the end... I have a bad feeling we'll be seeing Keith again, although I hated him and hope we don't. I feel pretty bad for Jill. She had such a tough time fitting in, then she finally meets a (supposedly) great guy like Lee only to find out he used to be a Strigoi and would stop at nothing to become one again. Oh, and there's that little fact that he wanted her to join him.. Yikes. I hope that Jill fits in a little better in this next book. I was really happy for her that she got to model! (hide spoiler) ] Definitely can't wait to read The Golden Lily (which I already have!!) I'm sure I'll fly through that one too! ...more Richelle Mead does not disappoint!

Bloodlines is a spin-off of the Vampire Academy series. The first installment of Bloodlines series, this book introduces us to another adventure of a lifetime. In this book, the story takes place soon after the events of Last Sacrifice (the last sequel of Vampire Academy). But in this book, we get to discover different characters that were featured in Vampire Academy-- the main characters Adrian Ivashkov and Sydney Sage . I won't be describing more details about the synopsis to avoid spoilers, but all I can say is that, this book is really, really awesome! It's absolutely well done. The writing style, as usual, was perfection! The premise was also surprisingly good. In Vampire Academy series, most books seemed to have a light air. But in Bloodlines, it was so much darker. So many secrets, intrigues, and puzzles were plotted. Perhaps it was the way Richelle Mead created a much bigger scope to the Moroi, Strigoi, Dhampirs, and Alchemists' world that made the book a lot more intriguing. This is the kind of vampire book that really hooks me from page 1 up to the last. The mystery, the humor-- they've gone beyond my expectations. I also love Sydney's character here. I love how she thinks before she acts. For me, she's a very responsible, mature, and ideal character. And to top it all, ADRIAN IVASHKOV . He is an absolute bae of all baes! Despite his snarky attitude, well, he's the kind of fictional character that is hard not to adore. He really made my heart ache with his inner struggles. T.T Perhaps the thing that prevented me to rate this book 5 stars was the predictability of the story. I found almost everything easy to foretell. But overall, I really enjoyed the book! P.S. I highly recommend you to read Vampire Academy first before jumping into this book to avoid spoilers (There were actually a lot of VA spoilers here.) :) Rating: 4 Stars ...more I do not relish, nor have I ever relished writing negative reviews. I would like to be able to say that Bloodlines exceeded my very high expectations. I would love nothing more than to write a glowing review for it. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen.

When it was announced that Richelle Mead chose Sydney as the viewpoint character, I can\u2019t say that I was thrilled, but I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. It is now clear to me that she made a mistake. Not only does Sydney fail to evoke sympathy, but she inspires hatred with her racism and plain stupidity. Eddie, who in my opinion had the most potential, was left on the sidelines and only brought in when it was strictly necessary. Adrian\u2026 I would rather not go into that at all: spoiled, selfish, mopey, reckless, utterly self-absorbed\u2026 do I really need to continue? He was my biggest disappointment. Those few funny moments Mead generously threw in didn\u2019t even come close to the Adrian I used to adore. And Jill\u2026 poor little princess. My heart bleeds for her. Except that it doesn\u2019t. After reading 11 of her books, I obviously know how Mead\u2019s brain works. There wasn\u2019t a single thing that surprised me in Bloodlines. The only real surprise was how weak I found it plotwise. However, I must give credit where credit is due: she still writes excellent dialogues. It is such a shame that terrible characters prevented me from enjoying them more. Nevertheless, my plan was to go with three stars until I read the very last sentence. That made me so angry! Was it really necessary to resort to such cheap tricks? Those of you who\u2019ve read the book will know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. I should be anxiously awaiting the sequel because of the main characters, not because she decided to bring HIM back on the last page of Bloodlines. It doesn\u2019t matter that her trick worked. In fact, that makes it even worse. So to conclude this rant review, of course I\u2019ll read The Golden Lily . What choice do I have? But it makes me infinitely sad that I\u2019m not looking forward to it at all. ...more Up until around page 320 I was resigned with giving this book 2 stars, but thanks to a well placed plot twist, Bloodlines gets and upgrade to 3 stars.

I really enjoyed the Vampire Academy series (even with the second half less than stellar) and equally enjoyed the Succubus series. I enjoy Mead's witty writing style. It's both entertaining and down right hilarious at times. However, with the exception of Last Sacrifice , I usually do not see where the plot is heading until it is revealed. Unfortunately, Bloodlines will sit right up there with Last Sacrifice on my shelf of predictability. Plot I won't retell the book here, but the gist is that Sydney, along with Eddie and Adrian, travel to a prep school in Palm Springs, California to keep Jill safe while she is in hiding. While they are expecting clear skies and smooth sailing, we all knew it wouldn't be that easy. A new problem arises for our gang which includes a threat no one expects...vampire hunters. I think one of the biggest problems with this book lies with the fact that most readers have already read the Vampire Academy series. As such, we already understand the world Mead is describing through Sydney's eyes. This often led to me guessing at the plot's outcome before Sydney even realized something was off in the beginning. I think this book could have scored more points with me had I never known the back story of Adrian, Rose, Jill, Eddie, and Lissa. As a result, Sydney is left to look incredibly slow on the uptake, which is kind of ironic because she is supposed to be depicted as a very intelligent person. What saved this book, as I mentioned before, is the plot twist that seems to be setting the tone of the series as a whole. I'm actually looking forward to the next books in the series for this reason. One thing I have noticed from reading Mead's works is that she does very well plot wise mid-series. I'll be very interested to see where she goes with this new concept. Characters While I was looking forward to read Bloodlines simply due to is being a VA spin-off, I was not looking forward to being in Sydney's head. When we first met her in Blood Promise she seemed dry, boring, and stuck up. I'm happy to say, I didn't get any of those vibes while reading this book. Now, Sydney's head is not as fun to be in as Rose. Not by a long shot, but it wasn't as bad as I originally thought it would be. Sydney is analytical in every sense of the word (except when she couldn't put the pieces to the mystery together, that is. -_-), thus approaching every scenario she encounters with a scientific explanation. It was so bad, she couldn't tell when a boy was trying to ask her out. Basic human, social interactions went right over her little blond head. Hey, there's another piece of irony for you...While Sydney was busy thinking of the vamps as unnatural sins against nature, they seemed to have a better understanding social norms and she remained in the dark. Now, I know other reviewers regarded Sydney as discriminatory and racist against the vamps, but I'm going to slightly disagree with that. This is not another ethnicity or race Sydney was dealing with. It's another species that feeds off of humans. Let's say you are a human and you meet a vampire. Would you: Bring him back to your place of dwelling and cuddle him, swapping secrets? Frolic around in the forest on his back while he adoringly refers to you as \"Spider Monkey?\" Daydream of him biting you, turning you into his undead lover? Oh you would, huh? Well, perhaps the Alchemists need to send your crazy ass to a re-education center. If you are sane, then perhaps your reaction would be similar to mine: I'd spare no haste in hightailing my ass right outta there. But, the one thing I will say about Sydney is that her reaction to Vampire magic makes no sense when she has their blood tattooed on her skin. Call it a necessary evil all you want Sydney, but I'll call it BS. Lissa-----wait, scratch that----Jill seemed to almost be a carbon copy of a previous character. I just can't seem to put my finger on it. Oh, that's right! Lissa. I'm really hoping that this is just my first impression of Jill on our first date. Maybe when we get to know each other better, I'll feel differently. I also found her to be a bit whiny and many times her and Sydney's relationship resembled a mother daughter relationship. I was really happy to see Eddie again. It's weird, even though he was there, I don't feel his character was remotely explored enough. I'm hoping this will change too. Adrian, Adrian, Adrian. He still remains my favorite character. Damn you Rose for breaking him!! He is rather depressed in Bloodlines , but he still maintains that cocky little grin we have all come to know and love. The Writing As usual, Mead's dialog never disappoints me. There were plenty of times I chuckled at the banter between Adrian and Sydney. -------- Now, let's talk about some things I didn't really like. First and foremost is Sydney and her OCD tendencies about her weight. I didn't like how she constantly strived to be paper thin like Jill. There is a part in the book where she is upset that her uniform is a size 4 instead of size 2 (her old size) or even a size 0 (which is Jill's size, thus further infuriating her). Add this to the fact that she is described as just moving her food around on her plate or not eating much at all and it becomes quite disturbing. It's just not healthy. I just feel it's going to send the wrong message to young girls. Second, it seems we are going to dive further into the machinations of Spirit users and what they can do. That's great and all, but I noticed a little hole in that: (view spoiler) [When we find out Lee was restored, Sydney mentions he can't use his magic (air) anymore. At the end, Ms. Karp is sent out to help with the research regarding this issue. But how can she use her magic, if she too was restored?? Am I missing something here? (hide spoiler) ] And lastly, some parts of the book were a little dry. It wasn't to the point that I would stop reading, but it was there nonetheless. Overall, it was an ok read, which will probably be a hit or miss for fans of the original series.

Gah, stupid story! It was plain old boring ! Sydney could never be another Rose and Bloodlines will never be another Vampire Academy. I thought this spinoff was useless when I first saw it and I know now that I was right. They took the most boring characters, minus Adrian of course, and placed them all together. The poor dude can\u2019t make the book good now, can he? I\u2019m not going to give the book a good score just because Adrian is in it. A total waste of time!

It was entertaining enough, but I never felt that reading it was a top priority. For some reason, though, I REALLY wanted to read Bloodlines . I was way more excited for it than Last Sacrifice . I think knowing that Sydney, a human and an Alchemist, would be the main character made it sound very interesting to me. I liked Sydney from the VA series, and I wondered how different her story and her character would be from Rose's. Also, although I might not have cared as much for Adrian as other readers did, I was still really curious about what happened to him. So when I had the opportunity to read an ARC of Bloodlines , I went for it. About a month after events in Last Sacrifice , Sydney Sage's life\u00a0continues to be effected by her decision to help Rose Hathaway.\u00a0Other Alchemists, including her father, don't trust her, and she has nightmares of being sent to a re-education center, a secretive place where an Alchemist who has gotten too close to vampires is\u00a0taken to \"learn the errors of their ways\" and eventually become a person less than themselves. When she is given orders to pose as Jill Dragomir's sister at a California human boarding school in order to prevent a Moroi civil war, she accepts so that she can\u00a0protect her younger sister Zoe and\u00a0prove her loyalty to the Alchemists. Right away, though, Sydney learns just how\u00a0difficult it is protecting a vampire princess in a human world and that Alchemists may not know as much about vampires as they believed. I don't feel like you should go into Bloodlines without at least knowing what happened in the Vampire Academy series; however, if you haven't read it, you'll just be like Sydney, missing details and information that VA readers would already know. The great thing about Sydney is that she's very intelligent. Her intelligence is her biggest strength, and she'll eventually figure out what she doesn't already know. People's first impressions of her is that she's spineless and lacking in some social skills. She is a little oblivious in certain social situations, but that's part of who she is and I really liked that about her. And the truth is Sydney's an observer and someone who likes to make sure her job is done efficiently without any problems. She likes to follow rules, but knows there are times when rules shouldn't always be followed. And she may not be a kick-ass fighter, but she's kick-ass in her own way. She has a sharp mind and is smart enough to handle herself in dangerous situations. I just thought Sydney was such an awesome character, and I found myself able to relate to her more than I could with Rose. She's part of the reason why I cannot wait to read the next book. The supporting characters in this book were Adrian, Jill, and Eddie. Adrian played a much bigger role than I expected. I'm really glad for that because he was amazing! Hilarious and perceptive. Usually bickering with Sydney and protective of Jill and everyone. I feel like I understand him a whole lot better now, and I can't believe I never noticed how great he was while reading Vampire Academy . I know readers are wondering what happened to him after Last Sacrifice , and well... Like I mentioned, Bloodlines starts about a month after LS. He really is trying though. He just needs people to trust and believe in him. So far he's doing a very good job, and I admire his efforts. I'm definitely rooting for him; he deserves it! Another thing I'm sure readers are wondering about is the romance and if it involves Adrian. If you're looking for romance in this book, I think you'll be disappointed. Romance was not a main focus in this book. I do believe something is developing, and I'm completely fine with the pace because I would much rather prefer a relationship and a romance to grow gradually instead of occurring instantly. That being said, I really can't wait to see where it goes! I'm crossing my fingers that it ends up how I'm hoping it will. Now that I've read Bloodlines , I have to say that I'm already liking it more than Vampire Academy ! I didn't want to put the book down. There wasn't as much fighting in Bloodlines (only because Sydney isn't a guardian like Rose), but there was definitely enough action and everything to keep me interested. I highly recommend Bloodlines to VA fans looking for a fresh start and a new heroine to root for and for those who just love Adrian! I know I'm extremely excited for book two, The Golden Lily !

Lissa : Rose = Adrian : x Hint: Spirit users have a most peculiar ability. If you're familiar with Aladdin like I am, you'll know it's one of the wishes that the genie cannot grant. The gifted Moroi can, but with, uhm, side effects. Rose : Dimitri = Sydney : x Hint: Ah, forbidden love. While in VA we followed the illicit affair of a then underage student and her infinitely hot professor, we are now presented with the blossoming affection between a (racist) human and a Moroi. It's not declared yet but there are 5 more books to go, can't waste it all in the first one, can we? Should I go on? Not necessary? I'll give you one more: Mia Rinaldi : the b!tch in VA = x : the same b!tch in Bloodlines. I could go on and on but then I'll be spoiling all the book for you, in case you want to read it. Have you guessed all the unknowns of my very simple equations? If you have, then you also have figured out that, in Bloodlines, Richelle Mead has taken a lot of Vampire Academy, given it a touch up and presented it to us AGAIN. Sub plots differ, of course, but the general idea? The same. And possibly worse. One element that really, really infuriated me in Bloodlines is the underlying motif of racism and discrimination that permeates the whole book. I could not decide whether to compare Alchemists to the Holy Inquisition or to KKK. This hate group's radicated belief (including Sydney's) that vampires are untouchable, disgusting and revolting unnatural beings did not sit well with me. The way it was developed and treated sounded very discriminatory and backwards (and a bit unbelievable too, IMO), you could just take out the word vampire and insert any other ethnic minority that has been persecuted in history and it would have fit perfectly. Hence, I did not like Sydney. I was pulling my hair out when she was naming her car and complaining about its color. I was scratching my nails on a blackboard when she got miffed because the freakin' fitter of the school gave her a size 4 instead of a 2 and she started getting paranoid about being fat. I was trying gouge my eyes out when she came out with stuff like not accepting food from vampires, checking that the water bottles were sealed not to drink from where they drank and stuff like that. I DESPISE RACISTS. Enough said. Not to mention the fact that this book is like a DIESEL car. VERY slow to warm up. The action picks up at about... yeah, 80% into the book. Before that it's a whole lot of racist comments, car rides around Palm Springs and mini-golf. Yes, you read correctly. So... are my 3 stars justified? Probably not. Yet, after being infuriated for about 80% of the book, when it finally started to take off, I have to say I quite enjoyed myself. Mead sure knows how to write some good action scenes and I foresee, in the far, far, far horizon, character development and possible redemption. Also, I liked Adrian. He's such an ass I cannot help it. His sarcastic and cocky comments were the highlights of my reading experience. And frankly, after the way he got treated by Rose in VA, I could not help but feel indulgent towards him. So, mathematical rant aside, I will pick up the next book in the series. This book is not as good as any of the Vampire Academy series but it MAYBE got potential, to be determined by further installments and consequent agonizing wait. ...more This is gonna be in third person . . . *forehead slap* C'mon, Richelle.

In related news, Thank GOD Sydney doesn't look as deathly pale on the REAL cover as she does online. That would be really bad. Finalized Review (8.26.11 Bloodlines is nothing short of deserving of a chapter-by-chapter review. This will be super interesting, considering I've never attempted to do one of these before. Mead is just such an interesting author, and I feel a need to do it. So, without further ado . . . Chapter One This eighteen-page chapter is undeserving of the title \"Interesting.\" In fact, I'd think it's more deserving of the title \"Boring as Shit.\" Even that might be an understatement. I'm sure if Mead wasn't looking for unsubstantiated length and was looking for making the beginning interesting in any way, she would've condensed the chapter, maybe made it about 10 pages shorter. A lot of the dialogue was unnecessary, only adding length to make it thicker and make people with the more-is-better aura about them happy. Chapter Two Hmm. Whataya know? The scene isn't even over! In fact, you get a total of 34 pages of this Perpetual Scene of Incessant Dialogue. Doesn't that sound fun? The two chapters together could have probably survived having been combined and sliced in half, if not more. Mead elaborates and elaborates and really she could have started the book in the third chapter while revealing small tidbits of information from the first two chapters and adding tension to the story, but you're not looking for tension, are you, Mead? It definitely would have made the story more enrapturing. Sydney is totally outspoken and seems really lame. She's definitely not the Rose-Georgina-Eugenie-type main characters I've come to expect from Mead. Chapter Three Yeah. The story would have been much better had Mead condensed the first two chapters into review spread periodically throughout this chapter. Although she wouldn't have been able to use the oh-so-creative \"I couldn't breathe\" opening line, it would have made for a better overall product. The majorly good thing about this chapter is the appearance of Adrian in this chapter, along with the awesome Abe Mazur. Those two characters made the beginning of this book bearable. Sydney left me at a loss for words. I mean, really. You could have at least given your main character a mildly interesting personality. Sydney is not, however, an interesting main character. She is a . Chapter Four Chapter Four is exactly what I feared it would be: more scintillating (yeah, right), vivid and endless discussion. However, following the addition of Adrian and Abs, we now have our fearless ex-narrator stepping into the spotlight. This is disappointingly her only cameo, if I'm recalling this all correctly. Rose is the most badass character to step onto the page in this book, which is sad but good. Mead wants you to continue loving her, and you will as long as she's the baddest one around. Rose's dialogue seems contrived to me for some reason, like it's not really her. Maybe it's just because I'm not hearing her thoughts and I'm not reading the book from her PoV. I'd much rather have Rose narrating at this point than the cardboard ex-plot-device that Sydney is. You know what? This doesn't even feel like a new series to me. It just feels like Vampire Academy book seven, but Mead needed a fresh new voice and decided to switch it up. Chapter Five I love how it takes 71 pages to do what they need to do to get the book rolling, am by that I mean I love how it takes 71 pages to get to the school. It would have taken 1 without all the stupid, relentlessly boring dialogue that preceded their arrival, but I feel like Mead needed that little bit for length and self-justification. Anyway, this chapter is all about their accommodations and adjustments and settling in to the school. Blahblahblah. Chapter Six In this glorious chapter, we learn how much of a nerd Sydney truly is on the inside and how un like Rose she is. In a book about Rose, Mead wouldn't have written entire scenes about her being in class. She'd write entire scenes about her kicking ass (which is her specialty). Can you tell I love and miss Rose's narration? Chapter Seven Mead knows how her fans think, and she knows they'll think this book is absolute dog-shit without Adrian's support. Adrian is officially my favorite male character to walk the page of the VA/Bloodlines series. I think Mead really screwed up making Rose stay with Dimitri in VA. He totally doesn't deserve her. And, you know, Rose and Adrian only have a three-year age difference. That's better than seven. Just sayin'. It wouldn't have been as illegal. Chapters Eight Through Twenty Seven These chapters definitely up the ante, something much needed after the shit-fest of the first seven chapters. The foreshadowing in this book is something Mead is very skilled with. She uses it wonderfully. Overall, as a first book in a series, it's better than Vampire Academy as far as actual plotting and structure go. The main character is obviously better in VA, but that's a given. No one really likes an MC that's outspoken and quiet. I was really happy upon learning that the series would be written from first person instead of third. Third person and Mead just don't intermingle. Kisses from Hell proved that. The climax reminded me a lot of Frostbite , and when you read it, you'll understand. The Moral of the Review: Don't let the sickening first seven chapters annoy you! Keep on reading.

It's been more than a year and a half since I've read the 'Vampire Academy' series and I had been delaying reading 'Bloodlines' because I thought it wouldn't meet the standards I had set after the last 'Vampire Academy' installment. I must admit I had forgotten how fun this world was. It's fun to read about and it certainly has a darkness and danger about it that adds to the mystery of this book, which luckily this book had ample. I had forgotten how snarky and bright Mrs. Mead's characters are, especially Adrian, which I've loved ever since reading 'Vampire Academy' and the way his heart got broke after Rose and Dimitri reunited made me feel for him even more. I had taken a special interest into Sydney when she had first appeared in 'Blood Promise' and found her an interesting character for Rose to be around. My interest was justifiable, since Sydney surely is one hell of an interesting character, even more interesting than Rose, I mean Rose was amazing and I loved being inside her head because she was just too badass and a free spirit to be contained. Sydney, in a way, is like that but she is more restrained and holds something back, but still retains some badass-ery and that makes her intriguing and makes me want to unfold the mystery that is her. This book had a particular mystery about it and although I had started guessing things when I was already halfway through the book, it still had a plot twist and I was really pleased by that one. Mrs. Mead certainly knows how to make cliffhangers though.... Looking forward to reading the next installment. I highly recommend this, especially if you're a fan of the 'Vampire Academy' series and the world Mrs. Mead has created. ...more Spoiler-free review! There's one really bad thing about getting to read an ARC three months before the release date -- especially with the ending that Bloodlines has -- and that's that I have to wait THAT much longer for the next book in the series.

There's one really bad thing about getting to read an ARC three months before the release date -- especially with the ending that Bloodlines has -- and that's that I have to wait THAT much longer for the next book in the series. I consider myself kind of an authority on the original series after being given the chance to reread them to put together Vampire Academy: The Ultimate Guide (out November 15th! Pre-order now!) so the thought of shifting things up after six books made me wonder if Richelle could make secondary characters as compelling as the epic story of Rose, Dimitri, and Lissa had been. Fear not, VA fans! Bloodlines is an amazing start to this new series, which feels different enough to keep things fresh...and yet also surprisingly comfortable and familiar -- like seeing old friends again. It doesn't feel so much like a \"new beginning\" as much as a continuation with a shift in focus from the series we already know and love. I was a bit worried when I read (somewhere, I don't remember) that this would be told in third person, split between Sydney, Jill, Adrian, and Eddie. Nope. While all those characters get lots of \"screen time,\" it's first person from Sydney's POV throughout, which gives it the same feel as the original books -- although, Sydney and Rose could not be more different. Rose is a kick-ass dhampir guardian who sometimes makes, um, *questionable* decisions, and Sydney is a totally \"by the rules,\" brainy Alchemist who can barely throw a punch. Seeing the vampire world, and the dhampir and Moroi characters, that Rose accepted and took for granted from an Alchemist's POV was very interesting and I can't wait to see where Sydney is headed as a character. And Adrian....well, what can I say? I loved him from the first moment he stepped onto the page in Frostbite, and Bloodlines has only solidified that love I have for the vampire party boy with oh-so-many layers to his character. Every scene he's in was a treat to read. He is capable of making me howl with laughter and, at other times, bring a tear to my eye. So, those who were lucky enough to get Advance Reading Copies, enjoy them! And those who won't be reading this until the official release date in August -- don't worry, it's definitely worth the wait! ...more Adrian.Adrian.Adrian... ahahahahaha sorry, I needed to fangirl a bit...

After the story with Rose Adrian is broken. He has mixed feelings and this is pretty obvious. On the one hand, he somehow hates her, on the other hand, he still loves her. Nevertheless, he gets a distraction in this book and in the end of it you can see the first changes. Adrian grows stronger. He is becoming a man we all longed to see. Sydney is bound to the Alchemists. She volunteers to beware her sister from the hard task but everything turns out differently. Not how she expects. Sydney is responsible for all the vampires in this book. And it is hard for her as a human. She realizes that the vampires aren't as bad as the Alchemist say and it confuses her. During the whole book I felt connected with Sydney because, as Rose, she is not perfect and not stereotypical. Some may say she is boring or annoying but I just think she is real and authenthic. Jill is a typical teenager and after everything that happened she is confused and lost. She desperately tries her best and it is just natural that she fails sometimes and wants to give up several times. Generally, every character in this book is perfectly imperfect. Each character has bad character traits and weaknesses and each of them has his/her own way to get along with the problems and this bad traits. This book is absolutely realistic and I can imagine that many people dislike the book exactly because of that. It is not enough fantasy and fairy tale. But as for me, the book is a perfect combination of fantasy and reality. The ones who love \"Vampire Academy\" and Fantasy books in general should definitely read it. ...more Why people are blabbering and rating this book without even reading it is beyond me. Lack of common sense, I think yes. You all remember Sydney don't you? One of the least memorable characters from the VA series. Yup, that's our protagonist, the joy! It never really stood a chance. Sure in typical Richelle Mead fashion the book is fast paced, engrossing and heck of a page turner. There are those moments that have your heart racing, mentions of Strigoi that have you on edge. Things that only VA ca Why people are blabbering and rating this book without even reading it is beyond me. Lack of common sense, I think yes. You all remember Sydney don't you? One of the least memorable characters from the VA series. Yup, that's our protagonist, the joy! It never really stood a chance. Sure in typical Richelle Mead fashion the book is fast paced, engrossing and heck of a page turner. There are those moments that have your heart racing, mentions of Strigoi that have you on edge. Things that only VA can give you, but with this comes a new series which should hardly be counted as a spin off. In my opinion it just seems a part of the VA series. You can't read this book unless you've read VA lets put it that way shall we. We should be able to read BLOODLINES without VA but there's so much going on that links with VA and then of course you have the old characters making entrances left, right and centre, which I loved, seriously. But when the old characters are the things that you look forward to, when Adrian is the one character that seems to keep the book interesting, who really shouldn't even be in the book - as much as I adore him, makes it's obvious, something is not right. Then there is the fact that I did not like Sydney. She never stood out to me in VA and she didn't do much for me in BLOODLINES, and since she's the MC and all, I'd say that's a tad worrying, especially since we'll have to deal with her in the upcoming books. I think many will agree with me when I say she should have not been the narrator. That was a big mistake and perhaps some may agree when I say that there never should have been a spin off series. As much as I hated how things ended in VA, I think we could have lived with it and if there was to be a spin off, no question, Adrian should have been the narrator. This story should have been his. Throughout the book I kept thinking how much Adrian was screwed over. He had been through enough, and now, it should have been his turn to tell his story. This was the perfect opportunity to let us know him better, the real Adrian. To makes things worse Sydney was such a pushover that it got on my nerves. the way she judged everyone, and ohmygosh her over - reacting about magic really pissed me off. I understand that she's been raised a certain way but so have the others and they find her bearable, they don't judge her. And there's no other way to say this but to be straight up. The fact that during VA we had this strong, caring, determined badass chick as an MC has given us certain expectations. No matter what I think of her for what she did at the end, we respect her, admire her and to be frank, she's pretty awesome. And then we are presented with this judgemental, spineless girl who thinks she's better than everyone else and who is pretty useless in my opinion. Then we are given Jill, Lissa replacement who is even more useless. As much as I had conflicted feelings about Lissa, at least she was strong and a good friend in her own way. She hardly matched up compared to Rose but you had to respect the girl for standing up for herself, for earning respect. Jill is even more selfish and careless than Lissa. Then there is the case where you have all these guys fawning over Jill, when my thoughts are, what is there to fawn over? The whole scenario with her and all these boys just seemed out of the blue and unrealistic. There were things that I enjoyed which mainly consisted of talk about the tattoos which I found interesting, and I liked how things weren't sugar - coated or glossed over when it came to Adrian. His anger, sadness and grief was real and I appreciated that the author made it clear how he felt, that no, he was not ok, and maybe he wouldn't be for a long time. Once again it was Adrian who really shined in this book, but I'm not so sure if I'm too fond of the direction I see his interest towards a certain someone, just no. As if not exactly liking her was bad enough, and now I have to worry about my favourite character falling for her. I know, it's close to being a disaster right? I mean what was she thinking? I have so many conflicted thoughts on this book. Maybe I'm being unfair. Of course it's the first book in the series, and Sydney may have a lot of growing up to do, and maybe I should just accept that she's not Rose, but it's not that simple. A new series shouldn't have to count on old characters to keep readers engrossed and unfortunately I think this is exactly what happened. You know what my first thought was when I finished the book? I miss Vampire Academy. I think I'm going to give the books a re - read. Had this book had the desired effect I would have not felt that way. This tells me that it missed something. Maybe it missed a lot of things, but I think somewhere along the way, it missed heart. I don't know what the intention was behind this series. But if the author knows her readers then I would have thought that she would have known that Sydney is the last person you want as your narrator. And of course the problem is that it should have been Sydney that we connected with. Adrian we already adored. Once again this gives me reason to believe that we are pretty much stuck with the wrong narrator. I still adore VA too much to just give up on this new series just like that. I have enough hope to tell myself that maybe things will change, and characters will grow as the books go along, and I think, for now, I'll try to put my faith in the author and hope the next book gives me more of what I know I want, what other want. Most of all though, I have a feeling that the author knows exactly why myself and others feel the way we do. I'm just hoping that something is done about it and that we are blown away by the next book. Let me just say that this is one rating for a book that I really wish I didn't have to give. The author is too talented, the series has too much potential for this to happen. In other words, prove me wrong next time around. ...more Have you ever taken a look at the sheer number of books Richelle Mead has produced since first being published in 2007? In case you haven't, the number is seventeen. Seventeen books in the past five years! And that count doesn't include shorts she has written for anthologies. My point is simply that I believe this author, who has an amazing talent for creating unique, believable characters and awesome dialogue has spread herself a little thin. Bloodlines should have been a fun supplement to the Have you ever taken a look at the sheer number of books Richelle Mead has produced since first being published in 2007? In case you haven't, the number is seventeen. Seventeen books in the past five years! And that count doesn't include shorts she has written for anthologies. My point is simply that I believe this author, who has an amazing talent for creating unique, believable characters and awesome dialogue has spread herself a little thin. Bloodlines should have been a fun supplement to the Vampire Academy world. Perhaps, since it is told from Alchemist Sydney Sage's point of view, a look at some many well known Moroi and Dhampir characters through fresh eyes. But it isn't. Bloodlines picks up not too long after Vampire Academy left off. Remember that rule stating a Moroi ruler must have one surviving family member to retain the crown? Opponents of Queen Lissa have made an attempt on her sister Jill's life, prompting Lissa's supporters to hide Jill in an unknown location until the law has been changed (to state that a person can still be a Moroi queen, even if they are the last member of their family.) Makes sense so far, right? I thought so, too. Until reading the following: Jill's secure location is sunny Palm Springs (because who would suspect a vampire of hiding out in such a sun filled location?) Jill is to attend a human boarding school with Eddie as her guardian. Sydney will be Jill's roommate at school. A new character, Keith, who has a past with Sydney is another Alchemist along for the ride (clearly he is here to create drama. But since he does not attend the school and lives off campus in an apartment, I'm not sure what his \"offical\" role in this operation is.) Adrian and a new Moroi named Lee are not attending the boarding school, but they are nearby and frequently are a part of the action fun story. This is the first thing which killed Bloodlines for me. Why the fuck not hide Jill in a secure, private location?? With guardians having access to her 24/7, personal tutors to continue her Moroi centered schooling, feeders readily available and no forced regular exposure to the sun? Maybe even Alchemists nearby to monitor the situation, ready to swoop in and clean up if things get out of hand? After all, Jill's hiatus is only expected to last a few months, so why the fuck enter the human world at all? Especially a section of the human world so highly monitored as a boarding school? Why send teenagers to protect teenagers? And Eddie as Jill's guardian? For reals? As a male, he enrolled in the school as her \"brother\" but of course as a guy he doesn't share a room with her. They don't have the same classes. So what is the point of him being there? Shouldn't her guardian be a female who can at the very least be her roommate? And why send an Alchemist at all? I realize that at some point in Vampire Academy the role of the Alchemists was explained. But I still don't get why these people who feel so strongly that all vamps and Dhampirs are evil go to such great lengths to protect them. What is even more perplexing is that at the beginning of this story Sydney has gained the disapproval of the other Alchemists because they believe she has become too friendly with Moroi and Dhampirs. Let's see... a teenage girl has become too friendly with the teenage enemy. Why don't we fix that by making the girl spend lots of unsupervised time with the enemy! Surely that will teach her a lesson! *bangs head to desktop* Lots of decent books have a ridiculous premise. However, I gave up on this one around page 150 because I still don't know exactly what the plot of this novel is. There is a small story line around magical tattoos, and the inevitable drama amongst all the teens. I am assuming that there are many mysteries to be revealed later on in this series because Mead has dropped a ton of hints. For example, halfway through the book, we still don't know why Sydney despises fellow Alchemist Keith. Abe Mazur (did I spell that right?) makes vague statements to Adrian, a new human character at the boarding school clearly has more to him than meets the eye... and I am over it. Presumably, the majority of the people who choose to read Bloodlines are doing so because they are a fan of Mead\u2019s work. Yet instead of respecting her readers and letting the characters and story line stand on its own, she has to leave multiple teases throughout the book. That isn\u2019t a bad technique for the beginning of a series, but for the spinoff of a six book series? As I said, the book\u2019s plot is fairly non-existant thin. So that, combined with the author withholding information and an unbelievable premise has turned this into a DNF for me. It\u2019s a shame because the world Mead created with Vampire Academy is amazingly entertaining and complex. I can\u2019t help but wish that Mead would devote herself to just one series, and spend a fair amount of time writing and re-writing and honing one book at a time. Her novels have so much potential but always end up being just short of fantastic. Unfortunately, Bloodlines is the worst one I have read so far. This is a series which I will not continue. ...more Before reading: After finishing 'Last sacrifice' I thought I'm missing something.

After reading: I finished VA \u2013 the entire series couple of days ago and even though the ending was satisfying, there are few questions left unanswered.

I thought it would be okay but when I realized RM has written entire series that is rather spin off of VA, I simply could not resist it. I had hard time connecting with Rose in VA because she was rash, snarky and careless. She cared about Lissa alright but she was someone who ends up doing things without thinking about consequences all of the time \u2013 and that got on my nerves countless times. But Sydney, I can connect with her very well. Responsible, careful and a rather rigid with her belief system but also who believes in doing things right. But socially she was not that much accomplished initially, it was fun to watch. Again something I can connect to. I read few reviews before started reading, and I simply cannot imagine someone like Sydney Sage with Adrian Ivashkov. Not for a moment. And up until 80% of the book, there isn\u2019t anything happening \u2013 not anything that could be considered even remotely considered as romantic. I don\u2019t know if this also passes up the category slow-burn however it is filled with some amazing moment like this \u2013 \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI trust you.\u201d Total shock filled his features. \u201cYou do?\u201d I was no better at reading people than I had been ten seconds ago, but in that moment, I suddenly gained a flash of understanding into the mystery that was Adrian Ivashkov. People didn\u2019t believe in him very often. They had low expectations of him, so he did as well. Even Eddie had sort of written him off: He\u2019s Adrian. As though there was nothing to be done for it. I also suddenly realized that, as unlikely as it seemed, Adrian and I had lot in common. Both of us were constantly boxed in by others\u2019 expectations. It didn\u2019t matter that people expected everything of me and nothing of him. We were still the same, both of us constantly trying to break out of the lines that others had defined for us and be our own person. Adrian Ivashkov \u2013 flippant, vampire party boy \u2013 was more like me than anyone else I know. I liked Adrian in VA \u2013 not because of bad boy or pretty boy image he has got. There are lots of pretty boys out there but what I liked the most is \u2013 his crude honesty. When Rose broke up with her, he called her up for all the wrong things, she has done instead of some self sacrificing hero. Relationships are hard and break-ups are ugly but I just hope it works out for Adrian and Sydney \u2013 however it\u2019s just hard to see it right now. I\u2019m still having difficulties imagining them together \u2013 they are just too different. Aside from relationship front, I really enjoyed, it\u2019s like reading adult version of Harry Potter \u2013 there are so many sub-stories going on and how everything falls in place at the end, still with few unanswered questions \u2013 which I guess helps you keep reading the series. ...more The one qualm I had about this book?

In short, Eddie rocks my world far more than Dimitri and Adrian, and that's saying a lot because I have a weakness for tall men with long hair and foreign accents - just look at my fianc\u00e9e, who, by the way, could snap Dimitri like a twig. Oh, and there is nothing I find appealing about Adrian. He's a selfish jerk who constantly victimises himself and thinks the world revolves around him when he's really an insignificant, useless nothing. I know I said in my Last Sacrifice review that I don't blame him for using cigarettes and liquor as a crutch, but even in the real world he's not really in the real world. Now, on to the story. There are way too many spoilers so let me just say that I figured out almost all of the mysteries before they were revealed. That's not a slight against Mead. She's a wonderful writer. I just know how her mind works after reading Vampire Academy. I love the mysteries she weaves as part of the narrative. being able to predict things in books is not a bad thing, because part of the joy is finding out you were right, you were clever enough to find all the clues and figure it out. And authors need to do a little thing called foreshadowing, so that when the mysteries are revealed, people don't go, 'yeah right, it's the first I've heard of it.' So, mysteries: good. I love Sydney. I love being inside her head. I love the way she thinks. She's a lot more thoughtful than Rose, and deeper. She thinks more. Rose jumps right in with both feet, bashing heads and taking names and only then thinks to ask questions. Sydney figures out everything beforehand, is prepared, studies hard (which I LOVE because it reminds me of me) and asks questions first. It's lovely to see the change in characters as we switch series. A lot of this book is actually Sydney's thought process. Don't let that put you off, there's plenty of action as well, and some quite funny and heart-touching moments. But it just proves that the character differences between Sydney and Rose. Sydney spends a lot of time in her head thinking about things, wondering about people and situations and what she can do to help, and then she acts on it. And the thing I love most about Sydney's humanity? (view spoiler) [She's surrounded by vampires and half-vampires and actually has body issues because of it. I'm so glad she's not another Rose who's so over-confident about the way she looks that every time she appears uncertain I don't buy it. Sydney's a human, of course she'd feel frumpy and ungraceful next to vampires and dhampirs. (hide spoiler) ] I would love to talk about other things in the book, but I really enjoyed it because I didn't read any spoilers so I don't want to go any deeper. I loved this book, and I'm really looking forward to Bloodlines 2: The Golden Lily. EDIT Whenever I read negative reviews of Bloodlines I find myself thinking, \"Everything you hate about Sydney, I understand and like.\" Like how she never stood up to her dad her 'social retardness' (ie being smart in class - she's been homeschooled so she doesn't know how to act in this kind of situation) being a teacher's pet (they liked me because I was smart and enthusiastic, what can I say) her body image issues her fear of magic her love of learning her feelings of inadequacy the fact that she doesn't stick up for herself because she's into conflict avoidance being the 'mom/mum' figure. My friends are so freaking awesome that I often feel like the only human ('normal') person around a bunch of vampires/dhampirs ('awesome people'). Also, I totally understand her racism towards vampires. They fucking eat people. People say Sydney is 'stupid'. She's not stupid. Mead is giving the reader a chance to work out the answers before Sydney does. It gives your that sense of superiority to call her stupid in the first place. If Sydney worked it out first, everyone would be SO BORED. And like, whut ? I have the same personality as Sydney so I understand her. That's why I gave it 5 stars.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Read my review on my blog! --> Bloodlines by Richelle Mead First thing\u2019s first: Adrian Ivashkov...will you marry me?

She isn\u2019t as brash as Rose is sometimes, which could become annoying, especially after six books. I mean, I love Rose...but sometimes I wanted to smack her! LOL Well, Sydney is more...tame. Her courage is quiet. She is totally book smart, genius even, but could definitely use some more practice in socializing with her peers. Overall, she was really likable and even endearing at times. She is also just as funny as Adrian. I laughed out loud SO many times during this book, mostly because of Adrian, but Sydney definitely held her own when it came to him. Sidenote: her dad is jerk. Just had to say it. I also really liked seeing Eddie and Jill; Eddie especially because I\u2019ve always felt bad that he got into so much trouble in VA. He\u2019s really an awesome guy and a great Guardian. What I like about Jill is that she\u2019s always been a fighter, ever since we met her in VA and was being taught by Christian on how to use her magic to fight. So she doesn\u2019t really act defenseless or scared, even though she\u2019s the one everyone\u2019s protecting. I found it so amusing that this group has to act like they\u2019re brothers and sisters because of the school they\u2019re enrolled in: Adrian, Sydney, Jill, Eddie, and Keith (another Alchemist, one you won\u2019t like from the start). I\u2019m really interested to see how complicated it will get once the romances really start happening. If I\u2019ve learned anything from reading Richelle Mead\u2019s books is to not trust anyone! I seriously doubt every new character that\u2019s introduced. Guilty until proven innocent. If you haven\u2019t adapted to this school of thought when it comes to her books, you\u2019re braver than I am. In Bloodlines , there are a few potential \u201cbad guys.\u201d I really loved the mini-mystery in Bloodlines that will no doubt play a role in the big picture of the series as a whole. And yes, ok...fine, I\u2019ll tell you: We do have a guest appearance by Rose and a glimpse of Dimitri. But that\u2019s it...this one\u2019s not about them, we knew that. If you are a fan of Vampire Academy and are not expecting this to be a \"Rose & Dimitri: Part Deux,\" but rather you look forward to it because you enjoy Richelle Mead\u2019s skills at creating awesome characters and stories, then you\u2019ll enjoy Bloodlines . I should also mention that if you haven\u2019t read VA, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d be lost reading this book. It does talk about different events that happened during the series though, so it will spoil it for you. I wouldn\u2019t suggest reading this one first if you\u2019re planning on reading VA at some point, but if you\u2019re ok with spoilers then go for it! Did I mention Bloodlines ends with one of the best sentences ever? Because it does! And now I\u2019m dying to have The Golden Lily in my hands! ...more AHHH THAT WAS AMAZING. Goodness, I still can't stop grinning like a fool. Richelle Mead got me freaking addicted in this world. It was like I was under a compulsion spell. I cannot get enough. Sydney Sage. She was exactly the opposite of Rose. She's patient, brilliant, (Not that Rose wasn't all those things, too) Sydney wasn't reckless and impulsive. She always thinks first before acting.

I'm a goner. I don't think I liked a fictional character in this kind of level before. Well, maybe Jem and Will. But the heck. I didn't expect to really emphatize with Adrian. I love his sarcasm and humor and it didn't hurt that he's charming as hell. Seriously, you would think I'm crazy while reading this because I was all smiles and giggles. Oh Adrian. \u201cTakes a lot of tries before you hit perfection.\" He paused to reconsider that. \"Well, except for my parents. They got it on the first try.\" I actually guessed what Adrian and Jill are after a few chapters. It was so weird for Jill though. And the freaking traitor, I definitely didn't saw that coming! I was shocked because I did not expect it to be that person! Oh well, appearances can really be deceiving. I just like to say that although I did love this one, I still prefer the first book in the Vampire Academy series a bit more. It was because some of the parts here, I wanted to skip them, like I think they weren't necessary. You know what I mean? I guess, I was looking for more fight scenes but I wish the next installments would deliver. And the cliffhanger, what the hell?! (view spoiler) [ YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU DIMITRI BUT WTH ADRIAN IS IN THE PROCESS OF HEALING WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?! (hide spoiler) ] I want this to be the last book I'll read this year but now I want to start Golden Lily. I need it to be able to breathe again. Because honestly? I'm still too stunned to do anything after this book.
