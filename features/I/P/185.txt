The up side to that is in the meantime, I'd bought Abhorsen as well. That's important. Sabriel was a good stand-alone novel. Lirael and Abhorsen are not. In fact, I'd recommend that before you read Lirael 1) you read Sabriel first and 2) you have a copy of Abhorsen ready to pick up as soon as you finish Lirael. Lirael ends in the middle of something, and the two probably could have been combined into one very long novel. Still, I recommend the whole series. The characters may not be quite as awesome as Sabriel, but they're still very well-done and the story is wonderful. I'll definitely seek out more of <---A>Garth Nix</---A>'s books after I finish this series. ...more Well.....okay. Not as good a book as Sabriel, I went with 3 stars on this one. It was close as the story is a pretty good one and we are still following the plot line thrown out in Sabriel, just not quite as well (<---B>in my opinion of course</---B>). We pick up about 14 years after end of that volume and we sort of get an introduction like, 14 years have passed. there have been many battles as the King (Touchstone) who married Sabriel (the Abhorsen) overthrows evil, saves the Kingdom and aids the people.

We pick up about 14 years after end of that volume and we sort of get an introduction like, 14 years have passed. there have been many battles as the King (Touchstone) who married Sabriel (the Abhorsen) overthrows evil, saves the Kingdom and aids the people. At the same time the Abhorsen has faced many terrible dangers, binding the dead and destroying awful necromancers. Really. That might have made a good book. Why didn't you tell us that story???? No we get to start over with another uncertain (even more uncertain) young woman. She constantly bemoans her situation, considers killing herself (but decides that throwing herself off a glacier might not really be the way to go), makes constant bad decisions that seem to work out for her and so on and on and on. And of course a young man who's managed to get himself so scared of his \"expected future\" that he's paralyzed at the very thought of it...and he won't go to the very people/person who might be able to help him with it. I'll be honest, I got sick of Lirael's constant woe is me I don't have the sight... Yes it would be awful to go through what she did, to face what she faced. But between her constant bemoaning of her fate and Sam's refusal to talk to his parent's when he had the chance (I'll wait till morning...oops they're already gone) about something that could threaten EVERYBODY... well, it got a bit tiring. This book may be (and I hope is as I'm beginning the third book Abhorsen) suffering from the well know \"second book in a trilogy\" syndrome. It's a bit long winded, a bit drawn out and a bit (for me) tiresome. I like good YA fantasy and the first in this series was certainly that. This for me told a pretty good story but could have done it better in maybe two thirds the length...just me possibly. Three stars,<---M> not bad</---M>, a fairly interesting story that tells us more of the world and it's people, hope the next strikes me better. ************* Spoiler below line ************************* (view spoiler) [I think the point at which I went totally from 4 stars to 3 here was when Lirale discovers that she is the Abhorsen in waiting her first reaction is \"so I'll never get the sight?\" Sort of ticked me off. I was hoping Nix would give her the sight just so she'd stop worrying (herself and us)over it. (hide spoiler) ] ...more When I glance at the reviews for this book, I'm actually surprised. Not that people would like this book, but that everyone would like it. I thought for sure there would be more of a split on it. I mean, the writing is good.

As much as I love Tim Curry as a narrator, even he couldn't save this audiobook. Lirael was annoying, and her dog was worse. Sam started out alright, but I came to loathe him more than Lirael herself by the end. Mogget the cat was pretty good, nearly as enjoyable as he had been in the first book. The first book, which I had liked. What happened here? Ahhh, don't know. Maybe it's suffering from middle book syndrome. Maybe the plot wasn't strong enough to keep my interest with a cast of such lame characters. Let's talk about the characters. I would not piss on Lirael, Sameth, or the Disreputable Dog if they were on fire. I so much wanted to reach into that story and rip Mogget's collar off, and let him go totally batshit nuts on those three. I didn't even like Hedge. I thought I would, but no. Fail. An Uninteresting Villain, that one. I found myself yawning nearly as much as Mogget (maybe that's why I like him). And what's with that ending? (view spoiler) [What, with the Lord Voldemort shit? (hide spoiler) ] Nothing was resolved, as of course I should expect from a middle book full of moronic characters. Well, I did kinda like Nicholas Sayre. (view spoiler) [And yes, even when he went Lord V on us. (hide spoiler) ] Maybe the Moronic Protagonists and the Disreputable Dumbass can get him out of the carbonite before Jabba the Hedge eats him. And WTF, zombies? This thing dragged on for so long that I actually forgot there were zombies. So when they attacked, I was like ! Hell yeah! But it didn't last long. Pretty soon we were back in the boat with our Disreputable Zeros. I am curious to see where this series will go from here. Maybe it needs some Ewoks. ETA: There was one thing in particular that soured me on this book. A scene about 65% into the book that really kicked ass . I mean, it was dark as hell, and a real surprise. A kick in the nuts for the reader, and a main character. But then in the next chapter, slate wiped clean - nullified all consequences to what had happened. I mean, eh? A really badass gut wrenching type moment where shit got real, and they roll that kind of a saving throw? The fucker didn't even feel remorse, since it was wiped out. I mean. This was Turn to the Dark Side Forever type shit, and slate clean. It didn't happen, so he can go back to whining like a bitch because he's afraid to read a damn book. Ok, I'm seething again.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 books in this trilogy, mostly because they appeal to my morbid streak. Death portrayed as a river with 7 gates?

I completely agreed with that point\u2026in book 1. Pretty much everything I loved about the protagonist in Sabriel is contradicted in the Mary-Sue that is Lirael, the main protagonist of book 2. Doormat/whiny/woe-is-me/doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s special even though all signs point to the annoyingly obvious fact that she is. Not only is she mega-talented ( but thinks she\u2019s worthless ), she has the added convenience of that \u201cdues ex machina\u201d magic that shows up unexpectedly and makes her 10x more awesome. It killed me that even after the Clayr explained that only super awesome Clayr develop \u201cthe Sight\u201d late and only incredibly important people are sent on missions, Lirael is ready to kill herself all over again and actually thinks they\u2019re just kicking her out. Yeah, ok, Lirael. Ok. And where Sabriel\u2019s looks weren\u2019t really mentioned and her \u201cromance\u201d was pretty dang tame for YA, Lirael, on the other hand, is a silent, sensitive wallflower who hides behind her hair but catches the eye of alllll the boys because they all find her beautiful, even though\u2026wait for it\u2026she doesn\u2019t find herself beautiful! Ugh, spare me. Sameth, the male protagonist isn\u2019t much better although he\u2019s a little more sympathetic. He might be somewhat of a spoiled brat, but at least his whining is more believable (not living up to his parents or elder sister\u2019s expectations, because, honestly, what they want for him isn\u2019t what he wants or is even capable of). Lirael, though, is out slaying beasts and is still like, \u201cShucks, I\u2019m no good at anything, why do I even bother living\u2026\u201d Gurl, write a sad poem in your journal and move on. Also, this book had no real ending. I\u2019m basically being forced to read the last book of the trilogy against my will. Basically. THREE STARS because Sabriel and Touchstone make cameos, Lirael occasionally takes breaks from moping to kick some butt, there\u2019s some crazy/creepy action sequences, Nix's world-building is always fun, and the two talking animals (Mogget and Dog) save the reader from utter boredom (concerning the main characters) with their snarky comments and superior characterization. ...more [4 Stars] I'm conflicted about this rating because the first half of the book was probably more like a 5 star book, the last half of the book was more 4 stars, and all of Sameth's parts were around 3.5 or even 3 stars. Why did Sameth have to be just as annoying as Lirael was amazing? Lirael was seriously such a fantastic protagonist, and I wish the book had focused almost entirely on her as opposed to bringing Sameth into the picture.

He just seems like a bit of a waste in all honesty: annoying, spoiled, stupid, and obnoxious. If Sameth hadn't bugged me so much, I would have given this book a 4.5 or even a 5 star rating, but as it stands now I can only really give it a 4. I also felt that things significantly slowed down towards the end, and I just wanted it all to be finished. I think part of the reason for this is that I'm not convinced Garth Nix can write villains I really love or love to hate or can just get behind, you know? They all seem a little meh to me. That being said, I do want to emphasize that Lirael and the Disreputable Dog are AMAZING, and their portions in the book, everything about the Clayr and the Library, and just gah all the portions with Lirael were 5 stars for sure. The rest of the book I just wasn't as convinced about. I think this is also due in part to this being more of a part one to the story and Abhorsen being part two of the story. Regardless, I really enjoyed this and can't wait to jump into Abhorsen! ...more A powerful return to Nix's high fantasy tale of two worlds, the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre, as a hidden evil awakens from the earth to threaten everything.

The protagonist, Lirael was much more interesting and fully realized than Sabriel, and though I'm not a huge fan of the Powerful Yet Enigmatic Animal Sidekick trope, I loved the talking Disreputable Dog. My only quibble is related to that particular trope - there were a few too many instances where the Dog got her out of trouble. Not so much to be egregious, but enough to remind me that I was reading YA. The true secret of her parentage was not unexpected, but really entertaining, and I'm glad we avoided the common pitfall of Girl Marries Prince. ...more I liked this book.

I mostly liked the pace. In the beginning it took a bit to get going, especially once I could see where the story was going. But once the plot became focused for the characters it moved along very well. As far as the characters went, I didn't like Lirael in the beginning. I felt she was a very bland rather petulant character, but then she was obviously surrounded by a great deal of power so I was kind of fascinated. As the story continued, however, I liked her. In the reverse, I liked Sam pretty much right away then he devolved a little for me in the middle and was a little bit pathetic in moments. But then he got stronger and a little bit smarter and braver and I liked him again. In some ways - and this doesn't happen often - I was ok with the moments when I didn't like the characters because a) they were still surrounded by a great deal of power and b) it made them more human. I accepted their flaws as very real and not as constructs or as the author just writing bad characters. fyi - Abhorsen is more the completion of this book, rather than a sequel. ...more OVA RECENZIJA JE OBJAVLJENA NA PORTALU KNJI\u017dARA ZA MLADE.

They are entitled to this sobriquet because every single one of them can see the future. Every single one of them, except Lirael, that is. Most Clayr receive the Sight by the age of twelve. Lirael passes twelve. Then fourteen. Then seventeen. She is an adult, and she does not have the Sight. This is the main source of inner conflict in Lirael\u2019s life. Lirael is also different physically. Her black hair and pale, deathlike skin mark her immediately out from her fellow Clayr, but Lirael is also unusally quiet and reserved, because Lirael is very lonely. All the other Clayr have a purpose. They all take turns on the Watch, and they wear the robes of an adult, while Lirael still wears the robes of a child, simply because the main indicator of adulthood as a Clayr is the Sight, which, as discussed above, Lirael doesn\u2019t have. What\u2019s worse, none of the other Clayr have ever Seen Lirael. Not one. They don\u2019t know what to do with her any more than she knows what to do with herself. So instead of actually throwing herself off the highest peak of the glacier, as she almost did on yet another birthday without the Sight, she instead chooses to focus on learning the Charter (the magic system in the Old Kingdom), which leads to her creation of her companion the Disreputable Dog (who is THE BEST). This is the Disreputable Dog when she first meets Lirael: \u201cSuddenly, the dog stopped scratching, stood up, and shook itself, spraying droplets of dirty water all over Lirael and all over the study. Then it ambled across and licked the petrified girl on the face with a tongue that most definitely was all real and not some Charter-made illusion. When that got no response, it grinned and announced, \u2018I am the Disreputable Dog. Or the Disreputable bitch, if you want to get technical. When are we going for a walk?\u2019\u201d Together, Lirael and the Dog explore the Clayr\u2019s magical, GINORMOUS library and mine it for secrets, defeating monsters lurking in the corners, and all the while honing Lirael\u2019s magic. Oh, yeah, did I mention that Lirael is a librarian? BECAUSE SHE IS TOTALLY A LIBRARIAN and the library is almost as terrifying and awesome as the Library the Doctor and Donna visit where the Library is an entire planet (and also the shadows are trying to kill them). Now, I\u2019m focusing on Lirael here because she\u2019s my favorite, but this book has other stuff going on, as well. It takes place 14-18 years after Sabriel (depending on Lirael\u2019s age), and Sabriel is barely in it at all. The two main characters are Lirael (obvs) and Sameth, Sabriel and Touchstone\u2019s son. The narrative starts with them apart as we get to know them, but eventually they meet up and things are pretty much BOOM BOOM BOOM from there on out. Both Lirael and Sam have good character arcs, their inner lives and conflicts are way more realized than Sabriel\u2019s were in book one. Sabriel can pretty much stand alone, but the second two books are basically one long continued story, with Lirael setting things up, and Abhorsen bringing them to a close. I think I prefer Lirael , though, because of the library, and because also Abhorsen honestly kind of scares the shit out of me. But more on that in the appropriate review.

For instance, the Clayr's glacier has an air of oppression and deep sadness, while the great library Lirael came to love conveyed a sense of hope. Every single place Lirael visited played an physical and an emotional role in the book. That brings me to how amazing the Clayr library is. It's everything any bookish person could ever wish for. It had thousands upon thousands of books, rooms filled with magical items, and the lurking threat of an escaped monster at every turn. So generally it was a ton of fun watching Lirael explore it all, learning crucial magics along the way. Lirael was fantastic. She embodies everything I look for in a protagonist. Smart, funny, and doesn't need no man to get the job done. Lirael managed to use her past to fuel her future, and didn't have the self pity that usually accompanies main characters. She was resourceful; furthering her knowledge of magic every time she could. She was always asking to read magic books or explore ancient tunnels in search of forgotten tomes. I really related to the curious side of her, cause if it were me, I'd be doing the exact same thing. I loved Lirael's furry companion, the Disreputable Dog almost as much as I loved her. The Dog is awesome. Seriously, where can I get one. She's loyal, funny, and wildly powerful. Unlike Mogget from Sabriel, the Disreputable Dog actually wanted to be with Lirael. It allowed for a kinship that was new to the series. Sadly, Mogget leads us to the negative part of the review. So Lirael has a split POV. This usually doesn't bother me, but I absolutely hated Sameth, the other character followed through the book. He is everything Lirael isn't; winey, self absorbed, and privileged. Intill later on in the story, all he does is make bad decisions and complain about the burdens of being the abhorsen in waiting. To make things worse, Mogget is asleep basically the entire time, so we don't get any reprieve from Sam's winey ways. Although, I could see a light at the end of the tunnel for Sam. Throught the series, I see endless potential for growth. He could become the brave warrior that fights for his kingdom. Maybe that day will come, but for the entirety of the book, he was a little snot that really needed to suck it up. Overall, the book was really good. Honestly, I'm regretting not have picking it up sooner. The ending was a bit abrupt, and Sameth was a little aggravating, Lirael and the world building made up for it seven fold. ...more As much as I love Sabriel (both the book and the character!), I was reluctant to read this again. Lirael\u2019s role in the library is awesome, but both she and Sameth are rather too prone to self-pity to stand up well beside Sabriel\u2019s example.

Sabriel and Touchstone might have a firm idea of their duty is, but I\u2019m pretty sure that they would also understand that Sameth\u2019s sickened fear would actually make a very bad Abhorsen. Communication, communication, communication. My pet peeve in real life and in fiction, alas. Lirael is more engaging, despite her bouts of self-pity. They\u2019re more understandable, and she has the Disreputable Dog to put a stop to it as well. Her life in the Clayr\u2019s glacier, her work in the library, her abilities with Charter marks and her explorations, all of those things are fascinating. And the Dog herself, too. It\u2019s difficult, because I do love this world, but Nix seems to have created a uniquely frustrating character/situation, perfectly balanced to annoy the heck out of me. I think I liked Abhorsen better, so I\u2019m hopeful about that and Clariel, but it was disappointing how much of a struggle this was to reread.

Check it out if you get the chance! 4.0 to 4.5 stars. The is the second volume of this remarkable fantasy series by Garth Nix. Given the well-worn venues, themes and even character types rampant in epic fantasy, it is great to find fresh, original characters, world-settings and magic systems. This series has all three. Add in that it is beautifully written and deftly plotted and you have the makings of a classic, which I believe this may become. Skvel\u00e9 a pre m\u0148a lep\u0161ie ako Sabriel.

It's kind of astounding how a 700+ page book can contain barely any action and yet I was never bored. Lirael is a sequel to Sabriel -- though I think Sabriel can stand on it's own and Lirael and it's sequel Abhorsen can be read without it. Lirael begins about six years after Sabriel ends, with a story about Lirael, a daughter of Clayr who feels like she doesn't belong with them and then later, about Sameth a Prince of the Old Kingdom and a son of Sabriel and Touchstone.

Lirael begins about six years after Sabriel ends, with a story about Lirael, a daughter of Clayr who feels like she doesn't belong with them and then later, about Sameth a Prince of the Old Kingdom and a son of Sabriel and Touchstone. I had trouble liking either character at first; Lirael is an introvert who isolates herself from the other Clayr because the Sight won't come to her and it's difficult for her to be around them because the Sight is the way of life for Clayr. The book even begins with Lirael contemplating suicide because of her despair of not being able to fit in, however she is given hope and a task that appeals to her inner self of adventure and she is able to find herself, even if it means never belonging to the Clayr. Her friendship with Dog also saves her from complete isolation and loneliness and makes for a great comic relief. Dog is a bit of a frustrating occasionally, but I suppose that's why it's first name is Disreputable. I loved reading about Lirael discovering magic, exploring the library, it's secrets and treasures. But whereas Lirael grows from an insecure, depressed little girl into an adventurous young woman, who despite her fears, embraces the destiny otherwise chosen for her-- I cannot say the same for Sameth. I understood that he suffered from severe PTSD from the rather traumatic events he went through, but I still felt annoyed and exasperated with him because he never otherwise grows from his experiences and continues to be somewhat of a coward any time he has to face his fears. I blame the absentee parents and even his sister somewhat because they don't notice how deeply troubled he; but then again how can they, since they don't seem to be a close knit family. This is one of the reasons I don't like like reading sequels that involve the children of previous novel's heroes because they always turn out so very different from their parents and often not as good or doomed to remain in their parents' shadow. I found myself skimming through Sameth's parts of the story and eagerly waiting to get back to Lirael. I think I would have liked him a little more if he improved or at least tried to face his fears, but no, even in the end he was so relieved not to be who he thought he had to be, that he even wanted to stay behind and let Lirael face the evil that's been trying to kill them on her own. How pathetic. I think what kept me involved with the story is Nix's writing style, he has a way of pulling you into the story by creating a magnificent world and weaving magic around. It's definitely an improvement from Sabriel because in Lirael we actually get to know the characters quite well, see them exploring the world, and growing as people. Although I had guessed who Lirael might be very early on -- just based on her appearance alone, I really enjoyed her journey of self-discovery. I can only hope that Sameth will improve in the next novel, Abhorsen, because I'm really looking forward to it. ...more Though the overall plot is very good...I had trouble warming up to the MC's.

She shuts everyone out and makes herself, and the reader, fairly miserable. She eventually finds a place in the Library and proceeds to almost unleash an unspeakable horror that's been locked away with a big, \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign on the door. Does Lirael think maybe as an APPRENTICE librarian, (a job which by the way, she never would have gotten without the kindness of others and is lucky to have) maybe she really shouldn't break all the rules and out of curiosity break into a sealed room like a criminal ? Then when she does unleash this monster, does she ask anyone for help? Does it dawn on her that man, I may get in trouble for being where I wasn't suppose to be but heck people could die so I guess I should suck it up and tell someone what I've done? Um...that would be a, \"no\". She decides to handle it herself. But since she has no idea how to do that, she takes months to figure it out and prepare herself. All the while she is risking the creature's escape. After miracles of miracles she DOES manage to \"fix\" the problem...does she decide she barely escaped disaster and should never do it again? That'd be another, \"no.\" She just finds other ways to go where she shouldn't. Does she end up being a fairly brave girl...she does. Does she have a good heart...yes, she does. Did I find her as annoying as shite? Yes I did. This book is also about Sameth. Another whiny, self-pitying teenager who needs to use his words and not just moan and groan about everything. The dog and the cat...can't say I loved either one, but at least the despicable dog appears to have affection for and is trying to help Lirael...can't say the same for the Puss in Boots. And can I just say, Sabriel and Touchstone turned out to be fairly rotten parents... So as annoying as the characters were for a large majority of the book, the world is interesting and the magic is original. I really liked Nick. Will I read the final in the trilogy...probably. Eventually. Maybe. ...more I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and, like it's predecessor, a page turner. The only down things I saw in this book were Sam was whiny and annoying, and I found the suspense that was built slightly broken by the swapping between characters. The first book was solidly on one character and had more of a fluid sense. This certainly didn't detract enough from the book to knock a star of by any means.

Since I blocked this with the spoiler alert I have to add that I really enjoyed the interaction between Mogget and The Disreputable Dog, I had been looking forward to their meeting since the fog first entered and I wasn't disappointed at all. One last downside, this book is DEFINITELY a bridge book. It ended so abruptly that I actually checked to make sure there weren't a few pages stuck together at the end. I can, however, accept that due to the fact that the last book must dive right in to the action without any set-up and bringing all the characters together from the previous two books will, i'm sure, be impressive. ...more This sequel to Sabriel is stronger on character development but weaker on action; I don't think Nix has quite figured out how to balance the two aspects of the story. In Sabriel, the heroine (and we as the readers) were plunged almost immediately into the dangerous journey across the Wall. While I liked Sabriel, I found her a bit flat and her relationship with Touchstone not terribly convincing emotionally. With Lirael, we spend much more time watching her grow up and develop some confidence.

While I liked Sabriel, I found her a bit flat and her relationship with Touchstone not terribly convincing emotionally. With Lirael, we spend much more time watching her grow up and develop some confidence. Her emotional shortcomings are due to a lonely and somewhat neglected childhood, caused in part by her own self-conscious of her difference from those around her. She is shy but adventurous, loves her dog, and tends to let her curiosity lead her into danger. The enormous magical library where she works is a wonderful setting. But although she has some adventures there, and the secondary character Sameth has some adventures of his own, their meeting and the major plot don't really get underway until near the end of the book, leaving the majority of the story for the next volume. ...more I didn't like this one quite so much as the first book, almost entirely because I lost patience with Sam. About halfway through, I started dreading his viewpoint chapters. Lirael can be a bit self-pitying herself, but she handles that far better than Sam does, and she's simply far more interesting overall. Sadly I didn't end up loving it as much as I was enjoying the 1st part. I didn't like the new character we were introduced in the second part.
