Todo el viaje de los Kane para despertar a Ra y evitar que Apofis se libere y el caos consuma el mundo es maravilloso, inquietante, trepidante y lleno de aventuras imposibles de superar.

One of the things I love about Riordan\u2019s writing is how he adds in little sentences that let you know something crazy is going to happen like, \u201cIt started when we set Brooklyn on fire\" or \u201cShould I describe Waterloo Station as it was before or after we destroyed it? --things like that are just brilliant and you know you\u2019re going to get a fabulous tale from the very beginning. This book was a fast paced, never ending ride of awesome the entire way through (<---B>yeah, yeah, tacky but sue me</---B>). It was action packed and fun, with the perfect blend of friendship, humour and romance to draw you in and captivate you the entire way through. It was great to see all the wonderful characters from the first book back, along with some new inclusions. Bes, Walt, Jaz were all excellent additions to a cast of characters that I love already. Carter and Sadie continue to be fabulous main characters and I love following them on their journeys. I feel like they\u2019re both really growing as characters, especially Sadie, who is really beginning to shine and I find it adorable to watch her face her boy troubles just like every other teenager while trying to save the world. Then again, most teenagers don\u2019t have the choice between a boy who\u2019s dying and a god. Still Sadie is hanging in there and managing to lean things as she goes. I admit that I don't have the same love for Carter as I do for Sadie. He's not quite as interesting and at times can be bland, but he's beginning to take shape too and I like character growth. I feel sorry for him with how the Zia situation turned out and I\u2019m hoping to see things resolved as the series progresses. Although I missed seeing <---C>Bast</---C> in this book, but I thought Bes was a terrific replacement. He was gross and grumpy and kind and funny and just a great guy. It was nice to have the dwarf god in the story and I\u2019d love to see more of him, depending on whether or not Carter and Sadie can return him to his former glory that is. The battle scenes within this book were many, and the fight scenes between Carter, Sadie and Apophis/ Vlad were interesting. I almost feel sorry for our two heroes. They went through so much and it almost seems like they didn\u2019t gain anything. Desjardins is dead, Apophis is in the abyss (although it\u2019s pretty obvious he\u2019ll claw his way out sometime soon) and Amos is the new Chief Lector. Ra is still, well, senile and Zia apparently has some big destiny that we all know nothing about....things sure are exciting! I\u2019m looking forward to the next book in this series, although I have no idea when it will be released.<---F> Can\u2019t wait regardless</---F>. ...more Reading dozens of books after this, I may have forgotten most of the events I read in this book but I do recall how much I enjoyed reading this sequel to The Red Pyramid. :) If I can say nothing else about Rick Riordan (RR) I will say he is without a doubt an entertaining storyteller no matter what age you are. While his Percy Jackson series are still my favorites I enjoyed this book more than The Red Pyramid. The best thing about this book is that there are more kids. It just makes for a little more humor when you have kids interacting with other kids instead of adults.

It just makes for a little more humor when you have kids interacting with other kids instead of adults. Now that Sadie and Carter are helping to train some new kids at Brooklyn house there is rooms for some new and interesting characters. \u201cFelix believed that the answer to every problem involved penguins; but it wasn't fair to birds, and I was getting tired of teleporting them back home. Somewhere in Antarctica, a whole flock of Magellanic penguins were undergoing psychotherapy.\u201d Carter and Sadie need to find a way to awaken Ra if they are going to beat Apophis (god of Chaos) but he has been missing for quite awhile and they will need to find some ancient artifacts to help them. RR adds his own spin on Egyptian mythology and \u2018The Gods\u2019 that is entertaining, informative and interesting. I always feel like I\u2019m learning about the culture as well as being entertained by the story. There were all kinds of new gods and obstacles to deal with along the way and Sadie and Carter have to prove even to the gods that want Ra to return they are strong enough to complete the task. I love the sibling relationship between Cater and Sadie. They antagonize and provoke each other but they are also the firt to stand up and fight for their sibling if they are ever in danger. Sadie\u2019s PoV chapters were my favorites but that is probably because she is so snarky and gets to have most of the funny lines. \u201cOur camels plodded along. Katrina tried to kiss, or possibly spit on Hindenburg, and Hindenburg farted in response. I found this a depressing commentary on boy-girl relationships.\u201d Carter still feels responsible for Zia and has been trying to find her ever since he found out she was hidden away for her safety. But he might just be a little obsessed, so much so that he is seeing clues everywhere. \u201cCarter, not to be unkind,\" I said, \"but the last few months you've been seeing messages about Zia everywhere. Two weeks ago, you thought she was sending you a distress call in your mashed potatoes.\" \"It was a Z! Carved right in the potatoes!\u201d There is always something happening with all the mini quests before the big one and I will say that Ra really wasn\u2019t what I was expecting, which kinda made it all the better. Who said waking up a god would be easy never went looking for one with and evil Ice Cream vendor hot on their trail. Add in the hint of a blossoming romance between Sadie and Walt or Sadie and Anubus and this story has a little bit of everything. It is the cutest crush triangle I\u2019ve read and I\u2019m not sure which way I want it to go. All in all a fun and entertaining ride. Sure this is a MG book but it is just as fun for kids of all ages. If you haven\u2019t read the Percy Jackson series I\u2019d say read that first (so much better than the movies). But if you have might as well expand your RR mythology and add a little Egyptian to it. ...more okay, 2 stars rate has never happened with Rick Riordan's works, until now.

And one more thing, the main charactors were Sadie AND Carter, not just Sadie. I felt like everything was spinning around Sadie. Carter plunged into trouble. Sadie solved the problem. Carter was injured. Sadie solved the problem(again). Even the sentiment was not fair, too. Carter's was just about 3 chapters while Sadie relationship occupied almost everywhere. The relationship lines, oh yeah. It's okay to me but the Carter/Zia love annoyed me sometimes. Why Carter had to act so STUPID ? AND SELFISH ? Zia is just another girl but Sadie is his FLESH AND BLOOD. Stupid, easily-to-obssesed,egoistic hero. Urgg. But there were some good things i like about this. One: It was freaking hilarious. Two : Set. He always made me laugh. Three : Bast the ludicruos but awesome. Four : I melt with Sadie everytime there was Anubis.Five: The fighting/ battle scenes were good enough for me. Overall, The Throne of fire is a adventurous, hilarious book that might be enjoyable if you like \"a bunch of fights\", mythologic book and the Kane Chronicles. I can't believe i'd say this but i like the 1st better. ...more The Throne of Fire (Kane Chronicles, #2), Rick Riordan \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0631 \u0622\u062a\u0634\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0631\u06cc\u06a9 \u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0622\u06cc\u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u061b \u0648\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0631: \u0641\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0645 \u062d\u0628\u06cc\u0628\u06cc \u0627\u0635\u0641\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0645\u060c 1393\u061b \u062f\u0631 463 \u0635\u061b \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u0648\u0645\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9786007132005\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0646 21 \u0645 Nuevamente Rick Riordan me sorprende con uno de sus libros, Sadie y Kane siguen sus aventuras mientras tratan de salvar al mundo de su destrucci\u00f3n.

Definitely five stars!!! ...more I just don't like the Kane Chronicles books as much as I like the Camp Halfblood books. There are plenty of reasons, and the fact that I don't like Egyptian mythology nearly as much as Greek mythology probably has a lot to do with it. I don't know as much about what Riordan is playing with, so I can't fully appreciate it. And I'm just not as invested in, say, Bast as I am in Apollo. That said, I was astounded with how much I ended up liking Best . It took awhile for him to grow on me, but by the I just don't like the Kane Chronicles books as much as I like the Camp Halfblood books.

That said, I was astounded with how much I ended up liking Best . It took awhile for him to grow on me, but by the end of the book he was one of the best things in it. The system of magic used here is interesting, and it makes internal sense. I'm not nearly familiar enough with Egyptian mythology or magic to say if it's accurate, but it feels right. It's also a refreshingly welcome change from the basically superhero demigods from Camp Halfblood. The characters in this series also feel younger, even though they're roughly the same age as Percy and company. It's mostly a maturity factor. I would never claim that Percy is a model of maturity in a teenage boy, but Carter and Sadie sure make him look good. Maybe it's because they don't have an Annabeth with them, somebody who is actually responsible. Maybe it's because, compared to demigods, magicians have it easy. Their abilities seem much more predictable and controlled, and they don't tend to have monsters trying to kill them all the time. Whatever the reason, neither Carter nor Sadie seem to be taking this whole saving the world thing quite as seriously as they should be, or as seriously as Percy and company would be in their place. I mean, Sadie takes a day off the quest to celebrate her birthday. Trying to imagine Annabeth's reaction to that was, without a doubt, the most fun that I had with this book. Carter is somewhat better than Sadie, but I just couldn't like either of them. (view spoiler) [Especially once they meet up with a now senile Ra. My grandfather had Alzheimer's, so their reactions to him really hit a nerve. (hide spoiler) ] It makes it hard to read a book like this if you don't care about the characters. I'm also not a fan of the gimmick Riordan went with for the storytelling. Supposedly, the entire book was narrated onto a tape recorder by Carter and Sadie. But it just doesn't read that way. When people are telling a story, they don't remember the huge chunks of dialog that Carter and Sadie are supposedly retelling here. It feels artificial. The best thing to do is just pretend that we're never told it's a tape recording and go from there. I wonder if maybe I'm being too hard on this book because I love the Camp Halfblood series so much. If I'd never read it, I wouldn't have found this one faintly disappointing. Then again, if I weren't hooked on Percy and company, I might not persist in reading this series. Because I will, if for no other reason than that I want to read the crossover shorts, The Son of Sobek (which has Percy) and Staff of Serapis, The (Annabeth!). ...more Oh, Rick Riordan ... *weeps* How I love your wonderful books! But okay, let's be serious now. The Throne of Fire ... Oh, my goodness. I love it so much. I'll start off by saying, I'm a huge fan of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. Nothing will ever replace that series in my heart, partly because, you know, I was younger when those came out, and they're the books that made me fall in love with Rick Riordan (metaphorically). Thus I have more of a sentimental attachment to them, one that Oh, Rick Riordan ... *weeps* How I love your wonderful books! But okay, let's be serious now. The Throne of Fire ... Oh, my goodness. I love it so much. I'll start off by saying, I'm a huge fan of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. Nothing will ever replace that series in my heart, partly because, you know, I was younger when those came out, and they're the books that made me fall in love with Rick Riordan (metaphorically). Thus I have more of a sentimental attachment to them, one that cannot be broken. After the series ended and I found out about The Kane Chronicles, I was skeptical that Riordan could produce something as likable as Percy's adventures. Even after reading The Red Pyramid, I wasn't sure. But after reading this book ... Hmmm. I'm starting to change my mind. No, I don't think I can feel the same way about these books as I do about Percy Jackson, but I can't deny that they are equally compelling (so far, at least). First, I love Egyptian mythology. I don't know as much about it as I do about Greek mythology, so I don't recognize as many of the myths/gods/etc. in these books, as much as I did throughout the Percy Jackson series. But hey, that means I'm learning something! It's educational! And it's made me more interested in researching Egyptian stories. Hmmm. I also love the characters. In the first book, I felt a little distant from Carter and Sadie, although I liked them. But going into the second book, and knowing more about who they were, I felt closer to them. I think they are both developing nicely as the story progresses, and the whole brother-sister relationship is both touching and amusing (as sibling relationships tend to be). Rick Riordan also adds some interesting characters into the bunch. For example, Bes, a god who has the power to scare people off with his ugliness (Hey! I can do that too!). And a new love interest for Sadie, Walt. I love Walt! (view spoiler) [And I like the plot twist about his curse, although it's rather reminiscent of Jem's disease in Cassandra Clare's Infernal Devices series. Oh well. (hide spoiler) ] There are some other kids under Sadie and Carter's training, who were kind of thrown into the story and not developed much ... But oh well. Hopefully they'll become more interesting in the remainder of the series. I still have a problem with the concept of the entire story being a recording recited by Sadie and Carter themselves. When people recount stories, they don't really talk using a lot of dialogue tags and descriptions and whatnot. Sadie and Carter also share an awful lot of personal info concerning their love interests and whatnot, which seems odd considering their siblings supposedly sitting right next to each other as they're speaking ... It's just odd. An interesting idea, but it seems awkward. But, my nitpicky issues aside, I loved this. It was exciting, funny, and well-paced, like all Riordan's books. I can't wait to read the third one! *sobs* But at least I only have to wait until October for The Son of Neptune . As much as I love The Kane Chronicles, YES I WANT PERCY BACK! <3 ...more

Then, after they have been bailed out and rescued, again and again, everyone bows down to these two idiots for the wonderful things that they've done. Here, once again Riordan's hero kids are faced with the end of the world coming in five days. So what does the girl do? She says: The end of the world can wait. I'm going to London to celebrate my birthday. Of course, in London a trap awaits her. She can't get out of it herself, but a new god appears and saves her by putting on a speedo and crying \"Boo!\" Her brother chastises her for her stupidity. Then with three days left, he finds out the location of the girl he loves (even though he has never met her), and he immediately decides to put saving the world on hold, so he can go rescue her. Of course, its a trap, and... Later on, the girl finds out that there might be some hope that she might be able to save Walt, the guy she has the hots for, from his curse. That's when she decides that the quest she's on might be worthwhile. Because saving the world from complete destruction just isn't enough to make things interesting. That part actually reminded me of a really funny Woody Allen story where he plays gin rummy with Death. If he loses Death is going to take his soul. As they start dealing, Allen says, \"What do you think? A nickel a point?\" Death: \"What?\" Allen: \"To make it interesting.\" Death: \"You don't think it's interesting already?\" On top of all this, I can't make any sense out of this world. At the beginning, its clear that five Egyptians got released from the Du'at and they have possessed mortals. That's the only way they can appear in our world: by having a host of some sort. Another example, from several years before, was Muffin/Bast, who is Sadie's guardian and the god of cats. She tried to take Sadie's mom as a host, but settled for a cat instead. Somehow, never explained, she then appears to the Kane's in her own form, without any host at all. How possible? It's never explained. And then, Gods without hosts start appearing all over the place. So what are we supposed to make of this idea of Isis, Osiris, Set, Nepthys and Horus all needing hosts. What does it matter? Pack in enough fake action and maybe no-one will notice that none of this makes a lick of sense. Finally, the high moment of drama in this book came in a very tense game of Parcheesi. At every moment, when I thought Riordan couldn't possibly make things more stupid and silly, he outdoes himself. It's almost as if he set himself a task to see how lame he could make these books and still draw legions of fans. But, as P.T. Barnum said \"Nobody ever lost a dollar by underestimating the taste of the American public.\" ...more This book doesn't really deserve a full four stars, but because I'm such a lenient reviewer nice guy I'll stick with this rating.

It's because this book is just so good for a certain type of reader, the type that would much rather be playing Xbox or watching mind-numbing television. I'm sure you know who I'm talking about. They're referred to as \"reluctant readers\", but I like to call them by their shorter and sweeter name. Boys. I kid, I kid. I actually dislike it when people assume I don't enjoy reading because I'm male. I also dislike it when people assume I enjoy watching football because I'm male, but that's beside the point. The thing is, Rick Riordan knows how to write a great book for boys. He did it with Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and he's doing it again with the Kane Chronicles. The plot of this book is so entrenched in action that readers of all ages will have difficulty putting it down. Rick Riordan's writing is pretty tight, too, which is one reason why I prefer pre-teen males to read his books as opposed to scanning graphic novels or playing video games. If you don't know this about me already, I have a penchant for reading chick-lit and romance novels - so the fact that I got through this The Throne of Fire speaks for itself. This book had serious flaws though. There were a lot of unnecessary attempts to evoke humor. For example, when the protagonists encountered enemies the author would throw in a \"funny\" observation that fell flat (like, wow, that thing is really ugly... really ugly). Another problem I had with this novel was that Sadie and Carter never really lost a battle - sure, they would be drained of magic or tired from casting spells, but something would happen to make them revitalized and ready to go a couple of minutes later. As for the romance... well, let's just say I'm glad Rick Riordan is sticking to adventure/action books. Though I am slightly interested in Anubis because of his sad, sad eyes (which were mentioned about a thousand times throughout the book... okay, that's a small hyperbole). Overall, a good book. It took me some time to finish because I've been busy and I lost interest a little during the middle section, but that won't happen to everyone. *cross-posted from my blog, the quiet voice . ...more Another diamond from Rick. This man can write no wrong! The Throne of Fire is the second book in The Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan, which tells of the adventures of modern day fourteen-year-old Carter Kane and his thirteen-year-old sister Sadie Kane, as they discover that they are descended from the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Narmer and Ramesses the Great. To be honest, I enjoyed this book more than its predecessor, The Red Pyramid . And I just enjoyed the story more and the humor. But unfortunately, its still not as good as the Percy Jackson and the The Throne of Fire is the second book in The Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan, which tells of the adventures of modern day fourteen-year-old Carter Kane and his thirteen-year-old sister Sadie Kane, as they discover that they are descended from the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Narmer and Ramesses the Great. To be honest, I enjoyed this book more than its predecessor, The Red Pyramid . And I just enjoyed the story more and the humor. But unfortunately, its still not as good as the Percy Jackson and the Olympians so I still would have to give it four stars. Ever since the gods of Ancient Egypt were unleashed in the modern world, Carter Kane and his sister Sadie have been in trouble. As descendants of the House of Life, the Kanes have some powers at their command, but the devious gods have not given them much time to master their skills at Brooklyn House, which has become a training ground for young magicians. The other branches of the House of Life are hunting the Kanes down once they left the safety of their branch, the Brooklyn House. And now their most threatening enemy yet\u2014the chaos snake Apophis\u2014is rising. If they do not prevent him from breaking free in a few days' time, the world will come to an end. One of the major reasons why I liked the Percy Jackson series or the Heroes of Olympus series more is probably because I could connect more with Greek mythology rather than Egyptian mythology. I'm more familiar with Greek myths so its not hard for me to place certain character but when it comes to Egyptian myths, I go blank. I do know who's Ra and Isis. I probably have heard of Horus as well but I have no idea how they look like and what god or goddess they are of and it was hard of me to connect with them. There comes a time when I'm just completely confused this happened a lot in The Red Pyramid , but in The Throne of Fire I was starting to get the hang of it. Hieroglyphs are cool and they look cool but well they also get me confuse a lot of times, I can get the hang of Latin more. But its interesting to see magicians with magics and spells rather than just with weapons. This book is definitely violence-free! Now, let's get it on with the characters. I love all of them! Sadie and Carter has that sense of humor that I'd love to listen to, and their sibling rivalry which is sweet and bitter at the same time is so fun to read! Oh my, how it reminds me of my brother and me! I'm glad that finally Sadie gets to grow up and starts thinking maturely, not to mention how to handle problems . And as for Carter, though I was kind of annoyed that he is so \"into\" Zia (which is also the same of Sadie being into Anubis), I admired his character, being that protective brother and all. And Bes, which is a new character here, though sometimes corny but enjoyable to read too. Walt! Oh Walt! You make me so dreamy! Like all goofy! IMO, this book has more mysteries and more things to guess. Moreover, more things that are happening. I enjoyed the fighting scenes, the bitter-sweet brother-sister scenes, the romantic scenes, the OMG revelations, the dramatic scenes and even the heroic scenes. This book is definitly more exciting love triangle between Walt, Sadie and Anubis, that's definitely something to watch out for. And that \"Weasels are sick\" and \"I want Zebras\" that is repeatedly mentioned really go me into thinking, and Zia's true role is also something to think about. Moreover, I really like how Rick Riordan portray different god or goddess in this book, its just so surreal(in a good way)! Overall, The Throne of Fire is a must read especially if you are fans of Rick Riordan's works. I love the humor, the hilariousness of the book and all the exciting Egyptian myths that Rick Riordan has in store for me! Definitely a edge-of-yourseat book and very kid-friendly as well! I can't wait for the next book! Whoohoo! ...more I enjoyed this one a bit better than the first book. This is another series I feel like I would enjoy a lot more if I were younger, akin to the Ascendance trilogy. It's still a fun ride though :) Note: This book is the second of the Kane Chronicles, following The Red Pyramid. If you have not yet read the first, there will be spoilers below. In The Red Pyramid, siblings Carter and Sadie Kane couldn\u2019t be much more different. Carter, raised by their American father, has traveled the world, dresses like a junior executive, and has been extensively schooled in his father\u2019s subject of interest: Egypt, specifically its mythology and history.

Carter, raised by their American father, has traveled the world, dresses like a junior executive, and has been extensively schooled in his father\u2019s subject of interest: Egypt, specifically its mythology and history. Sadie, younger by two years, has been raised in London by their mother\u2019s parents, loves pop culture and hanging with her mates, and making fun of Carter. They\u2019ve been raised separately since the death of their mother, but now- just before Christmas- Dr. Kane has decided it\u2019s time to bring the family together. Unfortunately, the ritual he enacts in their presence kills him and releases the ancient Egyptian gods, two of whom take up residence within the Kane siblings. Their Uncle Amos, their father\u2019s brother, informs them that not only are they descendants of the ancient Pharoahs, but this bloodline makes them magicians. Magicians, of course, have to be trained, always a chancy prospect, especially when the training gets interrupted by little things like the world ending. Hunted by the House of Life, the organization of pharoah-descended magicians with nomes all over the world, Carter and Sadie have to team up with Zia, a House of Life magician with unique abilities; the goddess Bast, who\u2019s been looking after Sadie in the guise of her cat Muffin; and any passing allies they can latch on to in their desperate trek to prevent Set from releasing Apophis. We pick up with alternating narrators Carter and Sadie a couple of months after the events of their first recording (the story is told as a transcription of an audio recording that was mailed to Rick Riordan). They\u2019ve sent out calling cards across the world and attracted a little under two dozen students who they\u2019ve been training in the mansion in Brooklyn while their uncle Amos recovers from being possessed by the evil god Set. It\u2019s an interesting bunch they\u2019ve attracted, but don\u2019t get too attached- we see almost nothing of their students, something I fervently hope gets remedied in the next book. We get very fleeting references to what could be some awesome characters but the majority of the book leaves the students behind in Brooklyn. Though they successfully kept Set from releasing Apophis, the threat isn\u2019t over yet. In five days, on the spring equinox when everything is in perfect balance, Apophis will break out of his imprisonment unless the Kanes can get the three scattered pieces of the Book of Ra and summon the ancient king of the gods from his retirement and very long sleep. The thing is, ancient has a bit more meaning when it comes to Ra- broken in mind and body, and thoroughly senile, Ra isn\u2019t exactly the strong presence and king they need him to be, especially when the other gods are in conflict as to the proper course. Horus and Isis, especially, don\u2019t want to see Ra take his former place on his throne of fire if it means they have to step back, and they\u2019re not too thrilled with Sadie and Carter for forging ahead in their quest. We cover a lot of miles in this one: from Brooklyn to London to Russia to Egypt to deep in the Duat and back to Brooklyn again. In the space of five days. Portals are our friends, but it\u2019s nice to see that there are limits to it. A portal has to cool down before it can be recharged again, which leads to some improvisation. That sense of limitations extends into everything. Sadie, especially, is very aware of these limits as pertains to her magic. She can do some AMAZING things, but the more she did, the bigger the oomph, the more it takes out of her. She doesn\u2019t have the seemingly endless resources of Isis in her anymore, and when it comes right down to it, despite her dual-pharoah bloodline, she\u2019s still a twelve (thirteen!) year old with barely two months of training. I\u2019ll admit, the age thing trips me up occasionally. Sadie is supposed to be twelve turning thirteen, and Carter fourteen in a couple of months to be fifteen, but they don\u2019t feel like it. They feel like they\u2019re both around sixteen or so, not just in the way they talk and the way they look at things, but also in the way other people treat them and even just in the physical activity. Sadie\u2019s an hysterical narrator, but she doesn\u2019t sound like a tween. Well, excepts perhaps in the sometimes appalling insensitivy. I hurt myself laughing when it came to the camels, but I also felt absolutely horrible for laughing. You\u2019ll see what I mean when you get there. Riordan does a very good job of weaving the backstory from previous books into this one (including private jokes from one series to another- cameo of Blackjack, anyone?). It\u2019s gradual, so if you haven\u2019t read the first book since it came out a year ago you may be a little overwhelmed at first as it starts right into a daring museum raid, but it weaves through the first several chapters so you don\u2019t get an info-dump. We get the reminders about meeting Zia, about the last Chief Lector Iskandar, about Set (who, by the way, is ridiculously funny- kind of reminds me of DiNozzo from NCIS, only in better suits), and about Michel Desjardins, the new Chief Lector, and not particularly a friend of the Kanes. Though he allied himself with them to derail Set\u2019s plans at the Red Pyramid, he still believes that their status as former god-hosts and their way of barreling into things without too much forethought make them dangerous enemies to the House of Life, even if they have no specific designs against it. Desjardins, though, has other problems. He\u2019s become Chief Lector in time to see the dawn of a new age, an age marked in the hall of time by two men struggling against each other. He\u2019s aging extremely rapidly (malevolent influences, anyone?) and at times he appears nearly as senile as Ra is reputed to be, his thoughts muddled and confused as he sorts through what he\u2019s trying to think from what he\u2019s being told. His\u2026what\u2019s the word here? Assistant? Toady? Stooge? At any rate, Vlad Menshikov, leader of the nome in Russia, is a seriously twisted dude, grandson of the infamous Prince Menshikov who was a close friend, and then reviled enemy, of Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. Menshikov may hear the orders from Desjardins, but he\u2019s got his own agenda. The two things that really mark any of Rick Riordan\u2019s books are mythology and humor. Egyptian mythology is confusing at the best of times, but Riordan really lays it out in ways that make it easy to understand. He literally brings the gods to life. Bast is mostly occupied on a solo mission through this book, but she and her Fancy Feast are still around on the fringes, and Bes, the dwarf god, is absofrickinlutely amazing. He was responsible for some of the reminders that I should look away from the page before taking a drink- laughing and swallowing do not mix. Horus is drawn in an extremely compelling mixture of heroism and petulance. There\u2019s a lot of good to Horus, but there\u2019s also a great deal of ambition, greed, and the determination to keep what he has. Carter has to learn how to separate himself from Horus mentally, to separate out what he genuinely thinks is best from what Horus wants him to believe. No easy task. And, of course, the humor. Riordan\u2019s heroes definitely have that element in common, but it\u2019s one of the things that make his books so compulsively readable. The way they phrase their observations, the teasing they give each other, even just the names they give things, are priceless. Take, for instance, this sampling of chapter titles: -Fun With Spontaneous Combustion -The Ice Cream Man Plots Our Death -Carter Does Something Incredibly Stupid (and No One Is Surprised) -Menshikov Hires a Happy Death Squad -Major Delays at Waterloo Station (We Apologize for the Giant Baboon) My most favoritest (used only for the most wonderful times) part? WEASEL COOKIES! Whereupon I remembered what it feels like to choke on popcorn and soda. For several minutes. Because I couldn\u2019t stop laughing long enough to stop choking. There are certainly some heavy parts to the book- there are oh crap moments, and sad moments, and moments of incredible courage- but the humor brings us through it all. No joke, Rick Riordan is one of my all time heroes. It isn\u2019t just because I love his books- though I do- but because they get people SO excited about reading. They race through his books and love them and they come to the stores wanting more, wanting to know what\u2019s next, and if the next book isn\u2019t out, they want you to point them to something else to read while they wait. As a reader, as a writer, as a bookseller, there\u2019s nothing more amazing than seeing a kid that excited about a book. Teachers are able to use these books in their classrooms to get kids excited about lessons, to get them actually involved and doing things. It sneaks out from the books into the actual mythology, but then it goes into history and architecture and language and so many other things. Parents may complain- usually joking, but not always- about how much books cost, but most of them are so happy to see their kids wanting to read that it\u2019s only a passing complaint. His books turn kids into readers. I still remember the book that made me a reader, and that\u2019s a moment that never, ever goes away. The passion he creates in his readers changes lives. Throne of Fire, the second book in the Kane Chronicles, out in stores now! Clear an evening or afternoon for this one, because you\u2019re not going to want to put it down. Until next time~ Cheers! ...more I just gotta warn you, I'm gonna sound super pissed off in this review. But I didn't dislike this book! I was just extremely disappointed, and was so caught off guard by it that it made me annoyed. First of all, the romance between Walt and Sadie. (And Carter and Zia, but I'll discuss that in a minute). What's with the romance in this book? It's so irritating because it distracts from the plot AND its instalove. No. Just no. And then there's a semi-love triangle between Anubis and Sadie and Walt I just gotta warn you, I'm gonna sound super pissed off in this review. But I didn't dislike this book!

And then there's a semi-love triangle between Anubis and Sadie and Walt. NO. Fuck off, love triangle. As much as I hate it, I'll take instalove over that any day. So, let's talk about Ra. (view spoiler) [ The depiction of Ra pissed me off so much. I felt like it was very disrespectful to use Alzheimer's for comedy. I mean, obviously it isn't explicitly stated that Ra has Alzheimer's, but he's old and forgetful, so I just figured that's what it was. And it pissed me the fuck off because it was so fucking disrespectful that we were supposed to find his Alzheimer's funny (hide spoiler) ] Maybe I'm way off base, but I'm still annoyed about it. Also, I like Carter and Sadie. I do. But they make a lot of stupid decisions. Considering the fucking world is ENDING, at times their priorities are very skewed. Sadie goes to London for her birthday instead of looking for the Book of Ra. Carter drops everything and abandons his sister to save Zia, the girl he is madly in love with for no apparent reason. Fucking get your head in the game and focus! Speaking of Zia..I hate that Carter is so infatuated with her. They've only ever technically met once. It's so stupid and it's instalovey. Although she is a cool character. Also, Menshikov is the most annoying villain ever. His motives are so fucking stupid (view spoiler) [ Basically, he wants to destroy the world because he was horribly scarred trying to perform a magic ritual and it backfired and it made him all bitter and angry. Fuck that (hide spoiler) ] I thought the first book was pretty funny. But this one kinda fell flat. There's a few good comedic moments here and there but most times I was unimpressed. That's a lot of negative, and I'm sorry for being a debbie-downer. So, here's what I did like: . There's a lot of action so it's never boring, and that's good. And as I said above, there's a few good comedic moments here. And I don't know why, but I like Set. Sadie and Carter think he's a villain, but I saw him as merely mischievous. Tl;dr- Although I'm extremely disappointed by this, I didn't completely hate it. I will still read the sequel. Let's hope it redeems the series. ...more 3.5 stars The Throne of Fire is certainly better than its predecessor novel. However it still lacks a little element to take it up to the same level as the Percy Jackson series and the Heroes of Olympus series. Each of those series have slightly more interesting worlds, characters and, to be honest, mythology. One thing I noticed while reading this novel is that the magic in both the Kane Chronicles novels is very...magical.

One thing I noticed while reading this novel is that the magic in both the Kane Chronicles novels is very...magical. I'm not just saying that it's simply good for a children's fiction novel. I'm saying it would be a perfect idea for a more mature novel. The way in which the hieroglyphs combine with godly powers is fascinating and new. Though I've seen glyph magic used in various novels the way in which it is combined with Egyptian myth is a new concept, yet not quite as appealing to me as the demigod powers in Percy Jackson's world. Here's hoping the Viking demigods are more appealing than Egyptian magicians! The other thing which I noted is how in this book Riordan has created a kind of unreliable narration through having the children record the events of the book in first person. I'm not certain whether he was aiming for that type of narration but it worked to make things seem a little edgy, which is tough to do when you're writing first person. One reason I particularly dislike first person (unless from a secondary character or when exploring some philosophical idea) is that when the protagonist is the narrator you recognise that the character will likely not end up in serious trouble or dead*. Third person narration allows for that greater sense of tension as the protagonist could be 'killed-off'. The feel of the first person narration in this novel is one reason I could not enjoy this story as much as others Riordan has written (also it seems that there is less of a mythological base to explore in these novels) yet for first person he has handled it very nicely. My conclusion is that if you're looking for an entertaining mythology based children's story you cannot go past Riordan's novels at all. I fully endorse them ahead of most other modern children's stories. Yet there are always better novels and stories such as the source myths and, as I always recommend, the true children's classics. *There have been exceptions but they are very hard to do 'right'. ...more Felix believed that the answer to every problem involved penguins; but it wasn\u2019t fair to the birds, and I was getting tired of teleporting them back home.

After the red pyramid incident, Carter and Sadie continue to defy the House of Life by teaching the old way. They now run the Brooklyn House and got some trainees (including the nine year old Felix who\u2019s addicted to penguins. I somehow found him really cute ^.^). But the House of Life didn\u2019t actually approve them so they not only faced the challenge from the evil side (Apophis) but also the elder magicians too. They had an idea to bring back an even older god, Ra, the Sun God, in hope that he would be able to fight Apophis. But not only bringing back Ra was very hard, the Sun God wasn\u2019t exactly like they thought he would be. The adventures in this second book is as exciting as the first. There\u2019re more characters and challenges. Sadie and Carter had grown up a bit too. Maybe it\u2019s due to that they\u2019re teachers now. The additional characters were impressive especially Bes, the dwarf god in blue Speedo. And Ra.. well he\u2019s kind of the main mission of the book and he\u2019s.. well, I won\u2019t spoil it, I\u2019ll just say that he\u2019s surprising and refreshing. Anubis also got a bigger role. The new young magicians were interesting too with each their own unique powers and personalities. And khufu was just adorable (which says a lot since I don\u2019t usually like Baboons or anything monkey-like). During the boat ride, Khufu had attempted some of his famous baboon magic on her\u2014patting her forehead, making rude noises, and trying to insert jelly beans into her mouth. I\u2019m sure he thought he was being helpful, but it hadn\u2019t done much to improve her condition. This is a light and refreshing read. And Sadie and Carter\u2019s narration makes it more fun :) ...more Another 3.5 Compared to \"The Red Pyramid\", this installment was better in some ways and worse in others.

It was interesting to see the older brother-younger sister dynamic between Carter and Sadie as they struggled with the dramatic changes in their lives and tried to save the world at the same time. In terms of story, I found \"The Red Pyramid\" more memorable and stronger as an individual book, probably because there wasn't enough resolution in \"The Throne of Fire\". I was left with too many questions (which is understandable because there's going to be a next book). ;) Secondly, the fight scenes weren't as exciting because even though Carter and Sadie had become more powerful as magicians, Horus and Isis weren't as involved as before. In this installment, the Rockin' Red Reaper (Set) was the only god who held my attention. Bes was amusing and likable enough but as expected, Set had more presence. He's a very entertaining addition and I'd love to see more of him in the future books. Another thing I didn't like? The romantic scenes. Yes, you read that right. I love a good romantic scene as much as the next person but if it's contrived, I find it painful to read. I found it strange that apparently, Carter did not just have a crush on Zia's shabti. He had fallen in love with her. Say, what? How the hell did that happen? Don't even get me started on the Anubis/Sadie/Walt love triangle. I thought Anubis and Sadie were quite adorable together in the first book but when Riordan decided to spice things up by making it a love triangle and involving another love interest who happens to be at death's door, it just became awkward. With all that said, I'll finish by saying that I am still excited to read the third book. Things are bound to get interesting now that Riordan's set the stage. ...more First line: \"Carter here.\" I could not finish this. It was just so bad. Rick Riordan is fundamentally not a very good writer. I knew this from the Percy Jackson books. I still (mostly) liked the Percys because I like Greek mythology, and the way it was being reimagined was interesting and amusing. Popcorn books. I have two major problems with this book\u2014well, setting aside all the problems with lousy prose and stereotypes and gimmickry that were also in the Percys. 1. I don't know Egyptian mythology First line: \"Carter here.\" I could not finish this. It was just so bad. Rick Riordan is fundamentally not a very good writer.

I have two major problems with this book\u2014well, setting aside all the problems with lousy prose and stereotypes and gimmickry that were also in the Percys. 1. I don't know Egyptian mythology. Part of the charm of the Percys for me was the juxtaposition of Riordan's modern Greek mythology with what I knew of traditional Greek mythology. When Posidon shows up looking like he's been wastin' away in Margaritaville, or Percy basically reenacts the Odyssey, I get it. Here, I don't, because I just don't have the frame of reference. Possibly he's being very clever. I don't know. The books don't give me enough to go on without that prior knowledge. 2. The protagonists are a pair of bickering siblings. Their bickering is not engaging, it's whiney and off-putting. Even worse, the schtick of the book is that they're dictating it, each sibling taking a chapter, so not only do you have them recounting their bickering, but they're interrupting each other's recitation with even more bickering. Bickering within bickering. What's up with that? Worse yet, Riordan can't write the sister worth beans. I assume I'm supposed to like her, but she's extremely irritating. Yeah, I got halfway through this book, then just gave up. ...more Rick Riordan does a great job telling this story. I couldn't give it a higher rating for one reason. Before I get to that reason, let me just say that I found myself getting lost in the story; then I would be reminded of my irritation and would have to work hard to get my brain focused on the story again. My big problem is with Sadie\u2019s age; it became a huge distraction for me. I honestly feel that her age takes away from the integrity of the story line. She has just turned 13 years old.

In addition to not acting and thinking like a 13 year old, she gets her first kiss. Then, throughout the entire story, she is so concerned about Walt and Anubis and confused by what she feels. 13-year-old girls have enough to worry about. If they read this, they are going to believe the same has to happen in their own lives. Why are we putting so much pressure on children to grow up faster than they need to? If a girl is holding hands and kissing at 13, what is she going to be doing at 15? There is no going back. Once you have started kissing, you will never be satisfied with just holding hands. With each step taken, innocence is lost. That is something that can never be regained. Is it really necessary to push our children into the adult world so soon? ...more 4.5 Rick Riordan es un genio.

I'm knocking off a star purely because a) I still can't get past the parallels between this and the Percy Jackson series, and b) the love triangle is ridiculous.

[If you don't like all the weird asides I am using in this review, Bog, and you think that it is distruptive and distracting to the main message of this review, then you would be in agreement with me about Riordan's plot device in the book.] An additional issue I had with the book are that characters make miracuous recoveries all the time. There was one time when a character was being carried like they have \"no bones in [their] body\" because they just used up all their energy in one paragraph, and then in the next paragraph they are sprinting around saving everyone again, without any explanation for the apparent recovery. Also, Riordan does a very unconvincing job of making one of the main characters sound British. In fact she doesn't sound anything like British. Rather, she sounds like an American that throws in a British word every hundred pages or so. And finally, when it comes down to it, both main characters don't sound like they are 14 and 13 years old. They sound like adults trying to act like teenagers. All in all, the book is more than a bit unconvincing, but if you can ignore all the distracting problems, you are probably going to enjoy it. ...more As the 2nd book of the series, I am not sure this was as strong as the 1st. I enjoyed it overall, although as one reviewer here noted, it was rather Sadie-centric and, as another observed, the Kanes starting their own school seemed a bit surprising given their level of knowledge. In addition, the asides (which I expect will occur in the remaining series for continuity) are not as successful as perhaps the author originally envisioned.

In addition, the asides (which I expect will occur in the remaining series for continuity) are not as successful as perhaps the author originally envisioned. I think the book suffered a bit (speaking as an adult reader) due to the very short time frame within which the action occurred and the relatively limited character development of some of the secondary characters which then limited the connection/sympathy to their plights (did anyone else notice that Jaz wasn't mentioned again after Sadie's ba conversation?). I think the first book did a better job within its own short timeframe of action. The emphasis here was on the action and not necessarily on the characters that made me care. That may be an element of trying to get the storyline told in three books and the difficulty in breaking this newest adventure into two separate ones with a reasonably satisfactory ending. I think it could have been done with an acceptable bridge ending, such as after the scrolls have been found and Zia rescued (and with a relatively short wait to the next book) - but hey - what do I know, I only read these things, and this is just my opinion. A good kids book, all the same, but not as good overall as some of his other books. ...more Estoy mas que feliz al leer este hermoso libro.
