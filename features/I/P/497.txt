A lot like \"Devil Wears Prada,\" it is just a laundry list of incidents while working for the shallow, designer-clad perfectionist. It reads more like an article in Us Weekly, In Touch, and or the Mecca of all celebrity rag mag's, People. What it is clearly the flaw in novels like \"Nanny Diaries,\" and \"Devil Wears Prada\" is that the protagonist fumbles through the novel lacking any goal or purpose. Instead, these idealists, cute but not too cute young women lament over the horrors of working for demanding woman and display their own shallowness by painstakingly describing every brand and designer as if reciting some holy mantra. However, what I'll give Nanny Credit for, over Prada, is that at least Nanny is short and concise. Truly a gossip column of \"did you know\u2026\" whereas Devil painfully goes on an on. It\u2019s a definitely a light read, requiring very little from the reader. However, from a cultural perspective it is interesting how we continue to vilify the successful woman and how we must focus on her flaws. Even more interesting is how the one doing the undercutting is other women. I don't dare pretend that these hardened woman don't exist but rather that there is now a whole market exploiting them. ...<---F>more \u010citaocima nepoznata \u010dinjenica, ali \u017eiva istina</---F>...

As the story progresses, it becomes obvious that the children are the losers, the parents have no business being parents, and the nannies do nothing to help make the family a better place. Instead they whine about mistreatment, go along with abuse, and try to replace the parent with their own immature version of love. The account was infuriating because there was a great deal of truth in it, and it made me so upset (recognizing the same characteristics in children, nannies and parents of my acquaintance,) that I finally refused to finish the last few chapters. What made the whole thing worse is that the book is written in a vain, selfish-masquerading-as-selfless, preening, whiny voice, that made me want to reach through the page and tell her to grow some cojones (and take a writing class or two.) Thanks but no thanks, this book is a binner. ...more I read this during a series of fifteen-minute breaks at my job. In the interest of full disclosure, I have a bit of a grudge against any book packaged as chick-lit, the literary equivalent of low-cal fast food.

Not so with this book. Now, I love the blood-letting of rich people just as much as the next person, but I got no satisfaction here. I hated the protagonist just as much as the mother for never standing up for herself or little Grayson, and I found her relationship with the Harvard Hottie (H.H.? Is that a nod to Humbert Humbert, <---A>Emma McLaughlin</---A> and Nicola Kraus? I promise, it will be lost on your readers.) completely implausible. It seemed like the authors were attempting to draw some sort of parallel between their relationship and that of Grayson's parents, i.e., this could be you in twenty years, Nanny, but then they chickened out. And the ending is terrible ! Nanny can't even tell off that bitch to her face, she has to videotape it! ...more Awful. I found the plot (if you can call it that) predictable and unimaginative and the characters flat. BO-ring. Wish I could get those hours back of my life. Can't believe they made a movie out of it. Although, if there are as many people watching \"American Idol\" as they say there are, I'm sure there's a ready audience for the movie. At first I thought I liked this book. It was well-written and emotionally touching. On the other hand, when I finished it, I was very sad for all the Grayers of the world, and a little bit angry about which people claim to be parents and which people really ARE parents.

There was absolutely no character development. Nanny was the same girl from page 1 to the very last page, and she is the girl I expected to change the most. Not only that, but the \"villain\" of the book, Mrs. X, didn't change at all AND didn't get what was coming to her either. As a fan of romance novels, I want the villain to get what's coming to him/her in the end, not get away with everything and move on to the next victim. Maybe this is more reflective of real life than the Happily Ever After, but then what's the point of the book? No one learned anything, and everyone just ended up the same or worse off than they were before. There was no growth and no change, and to me, that's the point of a book. ...more If you must insist on reading chick lit, I recommend this one.

The writing goes from hilarious to heartbreaking as Nanny experiences every ridiculous aspect of the hidden lives of the super-rich. I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes the Gossip Girl series: it's a good opportunity to look inside the same rich Manhattan society, but from the (much more interesting) perspective of \"the help.\" ...more 2.5\u2605s The Nany Diaries is the first book in the Nanny series by American authors and ex-nannies, Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus.

So, ignore the silly names, and wade through the interview experiences, the ridiculous demands of these ultra-rich socialites and their first-world problems, and the brand name soup, and there\u2019s actually a reasonable story. Which is that the nanny often has a much better relationship with the children than either of the parents do. And that all that money doesn\u2019t ensure a stable marriage or a happy childhood. Nanny lacks backbone (but not self-pity) and makes quite a few unwise decisions. Nonetheless, her dedication to her four-year-old charge is genuine. The Xes are, no doubt, an amalgamation of the worst parents the authors have encountered: pretentious, shallow and selfish. This tale gives the reader some laughs, some head-shaking and some gasps at the behaviour of the rich. Is it entertaining enough that readers will want to read the sequel? Doubtful. ...more I read this book back when I was in college. This was actually the very first non-middle grade English book I ever bought!

The only reason I tried to read it was because I was going through a phase when I lived in Seattle of noticing the books that people were reading on the bus, or in coffee shops, or where ever. I wanted to get a feel for what folks were buying. A very disheartening exercise at times. The book is one of the least interesting things I have ever come across. It tells the story of a young girl, recently graduated from college, who goes to work as a nanny for an over-privileged cunt* in Manhattan. In the movie the nanny actually allows the child to abuse her sexually and physically. Little Lord Fuck-face pulls her pants down in an early scene that I saw before turning it off. I would have put a cigarette out in his eye for that one. See if he tries that again. No wonder these kids grow up to be date rapists and poorly qualified U.S. presidents. You get the feeling from the book and the movie that you are supposed to feel a sense of awe concerning the lifestyle of the over-privileged cunt. I mean, this is what we all want, right? This is what we all aspire to be in our dreams, to be super rich and outsource every single human endeavor and emotion, to become sandblasted and airbrushed to within an inch of our pilates-toned asses, and to shop\u2014as if this is some wonderful form of self-expression. I didn\u2019t get very far along in the story in the novel before throwing it in the trash (disguised as the Seattle Library book deposit). Of course I was too embarrassed to even check it out so I just speed-read it among the stacks. I watched even less of the sickening movie version of the shitty novel. If you are thinking that I sound a little bitter, you can bet your fucking ass that I have been made bitter by this vile piece of trash. The book made a vague attempt to scold the women who make up America\u2019s new aristocracy. More than anything else it was obvious that the authors just want to walk in the same shoes as their over-privileged cunt masters who have closets full of designer heels. I really think that it is time for America to stop and take a very good look at the way things are progressing and decide if we want to keep on this course of allowing the top 1% of the citizenry to make all of the rules and call all of the shots. The new American elite make the Czars of Russia look like serfs. I suppose that just about everyone in America thinks that eventually they, too, will be part of this new elite class, the sickeningly stupid progeny of inherited wealth. The fact that so many people voted for one of these nitwits to be our president confirms this theory. I have always felt that everyone in the world should be forced to clean their own toilet. People need to be reminded on a daily basis that we are all filthy animals, one and all, whether you are Bill Gates or Bin Laden, Madonna or Hilary Clinton. George Bush should do nothing but clean toilets all day. *I thought a lot about that word \"cunt\" and the slightly embellished version of \"over-privileged cunt\" but I just couldn't come up with a more vitriolic tag for this sub-culture. If you have something more offensive and vulgar please let me know. ...more I absolutely LOVED this book!! OMG..I wanted to kill the wicked Mrs. X! I wish Nan would've had more back bone!!

Not once in the story did they seem more than dimly aware that their son existed. It's tiring to read about the self-absorbed (though not nearly as exhausting as working for them). Like DWP, we expect a telling-off of the nasty employers by the end of the story. In both books, instead of feeling satisfying when the girl finally stands up for herself, it feels empty. The wealthy jerks will write off her final outburst as the ramblings of commoner. They'll just find the next gullible girl to steamroll into submission. This book has lots of great details about work as a nanny (the preschool application process is pretty terrifying - I'm not sure at what age my parents started reading The Wall Street Journal aloud to me, but obviously it wasn't soon enough), and it is well written for its genre, but left such a yucky aftertaste that I can't recommend it. ...more Tata J recommended this book to me saying that he enjoyed this very much.

However, after the first third of the book, it became predictable: the Nanny and the previously bratty Grayer developing a strong bond. Then the last chapter drowned the whole effort.

Furthermore, I was a little distressed with the attitude of the \u201cparents\u201d in the story, to the point where I almost had to put the book down. Ugh.. I was kind of annoyed until the end. I guess that\u2019s the reason why they changed a lot of the story in the film. The writing was good, though. Clearly the authors have experienced a lot in doing nanny duties and they had successfully delivered their story and message to the readers. This might be a fun read for some people, maybe former nannies that can relate to the protagonist. Me, what I really liked in the story is little Grayer, his resilience and patience and cuteness and maturity with the situation he was stuck in. Poor little boy, I would likely adopt you if your parents won\u2019t wake up after I bash them in the head. ...more The Nanny Diaries follows the tale of a woman named Nanny as she works for a family called the Xes.

Okay, I've had this book on my to-read shelf for a while and I finally got around to reading it. Well, it was very disappointing. The first thing I didn't like was the names. Her name is Nanny, the parents are Mr. X and Mrs. X, the child is Grayer and she calls her crush H.H. which stands for Harvard Hottie. To me, this showed a horrible lack of imagination and it felt like the author was too lazy to come up with names. The second thing that I didn't like was Nanny. She spent most of the novel whining and crying. She cried to her parents, to her grandmother, her friends and H.H. Instead of doing something about her problems, she just complains about her crappy life. The only thing I really liked about this book was little Grayer. He just sounded so cute and I felt really bad for him. His parents really need to be smacked and told to grow the hell up. It's pretty bad when a four-year-old is more mature than his parents. Overall, I was very disappointed in the book. It was hard to get into, and once I started reading I couldn't wait for it to end. I probably wouldn't ever recommend it to anyone. ...more Title: The Nanny Diaries Author: Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus Copyright date: 2002 Publisher: St. Martin's Griffin How many pages: 306 pgs How long it took me to read: 10 days Category: Fiction I learned about this book from: Seeing it around Chapter's and then being released as a movie This book was purchased at: McNeely and Robinson This book is: for people who are thinking about becoming a Nanny Other books by these authors: Dedication and Citizen girl Favorite characters: Grayer, Nanny, Harvard Hot Title: The Nanny Diaries Author: Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus Copyright date: 2002 Publisher: St. Martin's Griffin How many pages: 306 pgs How long it took me to read: 10 days Category: Fiction I learned about this book from: Seeing it around Chapter's and then being released as a movie This book was purchased at: McNeely and Robinson This book is: for people who are thinking about becoming a Nanny Other books by these authors: Dedication and Citizen girl Favorite characters: Grayer, Nanny, Harvard Hottie and Josh When and Where the story takes place: New York Plot in a nutshell: Nanny takes a job taking care of a little boy who's parents are completely horrible parents and care more about their money than their son.

Parents like that should get a rude awakening. Overall rating: I am so glad for this book. I was getting ready to become a Nanny but this made me come to the realisation of who I will be working for and I know this is an exaggeration of what being a Nanny is like but it's true...why can't these parents take care of their own damn kids?!

And this is exactly what's happened with Nan. The authors show a glimpse into a richer-than-any-person-should-concievably-be New York household. The collision of the very different world of Nan, struggling college student, and that of \"Mrs. X,\" double whammy of high-society egocentric snob, produce situations that are both comical and tragic--and infuriating. The first chapter is my favorite of the novel, as Nan playfully pokes fun at the weathly class's conventions. Unfortunately, I felt the book went downhill from there. Although I was very involved in the story and did enjoy the book, I felt the story weakened with each chapter. The ending was very unsatifying to me, which is perhaps part of the message: the nannying world takes no prisoners and shows no mercy. Not even to those just a few feet tall. Overall, I did enjoy the book, although I'm not sure I would really recommend it. But, I am satisfied to go the movies now, guilt-free. =) ...more Palate cleanser after reading about child soldiers though I think I may have overshot like when you take too many antibiotics and then you need a fecal transfusion to restore the balance.

I've never met anyone so selfless and endlessly caring. Why are we supposed to feel sorry for/sympathize with someone whose problems are pretty much the result of her having No Backbone Whatsoever? The writing is fluid and the book is definitely readable, but it wasn't as funny as I expected. Kind of struck me as COFFEE, TEA, OR ME? with nannies.

Must relish sixteen-hour shifts with a deliberately nap-deprived preschooler. Must love getting thrown up on, literally and figuratively, by everyone in his family.

Those who take it personally need not apply. Who wouldn't want this job? Struggling to graduate from NYU and afford her microscopic studio apartment, Nanny takes a position caring for the only son of the wealthy X family. She rapidly learns the insane amount of juggling involved to ensure that a Park Avenue wife who doesn't work, cook, clean, or raise her own child has a smooth day. When the Xs' marriage begins to disintegrate, Nanny ends up involved way beyond the bounds of human decency or good taste. Her tenure with the X family becomes a nearly impossible mission to maintain the mental health of their four-year-old, her own integrity and, most importantly, her sense of humor. Over nine tense months, Mrs. X and Nanny perform the age-old dance of decorum and power as they test the limits of modern-day servitude. My Review: The X's and friends don't see the people that sacrifice everything including their own personal lives and families to ensure that these people sitting on cushions can continue looking down their noses at employees they consider below them meant to be unseen and unheard. The X's and others aren't equipped to take responsibility for anything including their own children and can't see beyond the color filling their bank accounts. The psychological turmoil these people cause their children by introducing and removing nannies and caretakers from their lives as easily as they do their husbands, wives and lovers is something you can't help but shake your head over. You see the sense of disconnect between parent and child, the neglect, the complete sense of self centered selfishness that the X's are corrupted by as they push their children onto poor unsuspecting servants who despite their level of experience in the field really have no idea just how bad some of these people really can be. Eventually it begins to wear on and test Nanny's defenses, her patience, and her morals. I liked that Nanny tried to stick with it for little G but in the end a person can only endure so much before you hit a wall. I really like how Nanny went out at the end because you think 'way to go, good for you.' I was happy that after being so tolerant the entire time that Nanny finally spoke up. I mean really. Someone needed to say it. The Nanny Diaries was a book I wasn't sure I would like at first but once I started it couldn't put it down until it was finished. Its also a story that confirms my opinion that many upper crust people in society shouldn't breed.

Or I can blame my Chris Evans fangirling hitting a resurge moment lately. Either way, it's on him... Okay, so the movie mirrors the book pretty well. As always, there are moments not covered by the movie that make the book better and vice versa. For example: (view spoiler) [ In the movie, Mrs. X finds lingerie in her clothing from the cleaners and assumes it's Nanny's. Just a random thing. Well, in the book it explains that Mr. X's mistress actually left the lingerie and Nanny knew about it. (hide spoiler) ] Both movie and book were absolutely adorable. Both were sweet in some parts, cute in others, and just somewhat off sometimes. Like Nan's roommate in the book...I don't like it. She was a BI+[#. Not to be crass, but yes. Her and that hairy pilot guy. Like Nan(ny) taking care of Grayer while Mrs. X does...well, whatever Mrs. X does...just utterly sweet and some over the top moments that only an involved mom or nanny would understand. Meeting Harvard Hottie in both was fantastic and so very similar. Now to the point of about 90%, this book was a 4 to 5 star for me. It was equally as great as the movie. Equally as cute, though I could have used more Harvard, but then who couldn't? But it was good. And then I flip and realize I'm almost at the end...and it doesn't feel like it's resolving...and...wait, what? Wait. WAIT! What about (view spoiler) [ the moment when Harvard Hottie meets her in the end after she gets fired? What about telling Mrs X off as she truly deserves. What about some sort of real resolution as far as the characters are concerned? Because, in the movie, it felt like I could move on from it, Nanny was happy, Grayer and Mrs X had the beginning of a better life, it felt like everyone had something to look forward to, and here, it just...*poof* ended. (hide spoiler) ] ? I do know there is a second book, and people either really loved it or really hated it...and I will read it at some point...but for now, I must rewatch the movie...I want that 5 star feeling back.

The protagonist is a passive-aggressive and witless young woman who just lets people exploit her inability to be confrontational. The object of romance bears the single redeeming quality that he is a Harvard Hottie and seems to like her back. Just about any woman in the book, including the antagonist but maybe excluding the protagonist\u2019s mother and grandmother, is somehow treated like cheap socks \u2013 useful for a while but eventually disposable \u2013 and just puts up with it. Lame attempts at humor could make comedians lament. We don\u2019t ask for a happy ending. However, it seems the writers are trying to somehow come to a resolve. This, true to the protagonist\u2019s personality, is done in a passive-aggressive manner and I am sorely disappointed in this fictional character for how she put up with nine months of bullshit and did nothing about it when she was given nothing to show for her hard work.

The girl should have just been more face to face about the money she was owed and, if she was getting fired anyway, she should have said whatever the hell she wanted. Maybe my demands are beyond reach in the world where nannies must contend against the upper crust of New York.

I thought Nanny was a pretty cool character and Grayson, too. I love their relationship and the way she handled him when it got rough. I thought she was awesome with kids. With H.H. she was not so cool, she kept going ballistic on him and giving him huge attitude, but when he wasn't around and she was thinking about him, she was more realistic and not so childish.
