Most countries in Asia were once colonies of European or American countries and their influences will forever stay no matter how many centuries have passed. Also, this is one of the most readable. Although the verses are oftentimes playful, the storytelling is concise. Almost all the characters seem to be alive and the imageries that the scenes create seem like imprints that will stay in your mind for a long time. It may not be as comprehensive as Salman Rusdie\u2019s Midnight\u2019s Children although it is also about India that used to be under the British empire. However, it is more exact with its urgent message: the loss of the nation\u2019s true identity due to western influences. The true Indian identity that was an amalgam of the nation\u2019s own culture and tradition spawning several centuries when they were still free of foreign influences. After all, India has one of the oldest civilizations in the world. It may not be as tear-jerking and bewildering as Arundhati Roy\u2019s The God of Small Things although it is also about Indian families trying to survive the Third-World realities of life. However, it is more realistic with the characters finding themselves in the situations that were not imposed to them but mostly of their own choices. I think this is what made me appreciate Desai\u2019s over Roy\u2019s: that her characters have choices, despite the fact that those options are limited because of the harsh environment that they happened to live in. It may not be as current as Aravind Adiga\u2019s The White Tiger although it is also about the changing landscape of a small Indian town. However, Desai\u2019s storytelling is more engaging as she has this rare ability to take you in a roller-coaster ride: you\u2019ll be in enthralled by her playful verses,<---M> in deep thoughts by her heartfelt message</---M>, in gratitude by being in a better state in life than her characters, in aversion to any form of racial discrimination by following the sad fate of Biju hopping from one job to another as an illegal alien in the USA and yet, in the end, you will feel cheering for her characters as you are able to identify yourself with them. That no matter what we go through in life, there is still hope that awaits us at the end of each tumultuous journey. One of my GR friends once commented that he has veered away from novels with India as a setting because they are always about being destitute and poor. There may be some truth on this. However, novels are supposed to be about reality and that\u2019s how most of the people live in India.<---F> I have been to Mumbai thrice</---F>. In my 27 years in the corporate world, I have been fortunate to work under 4 Indian nationals and each of them has been telling me about too much politicking that hinders the development and progress in their country. They are all good bosses: with good education, very smart, knowledgeable, conscientious, culture-sensitive and appreciative. They and the other Indian people I had a chance to meet make me wonder: how come that despite many good people in India, they seem to have difficulty in putting their acts together to propel their country to a higher ground? Then I thought, I might as well be talking about the Filipinos and the Philippines. ...more I'm not going to say that this novel is bad (Chorus of GR friends : Say it, go on, you know you want to... ) but it was pretty ghastly for me. It was strangled to death by a style you could describe as inane wittering , a crew of characters all of which are loveably eccentric and a plot that Ms Desai believes will take care of itself as the inane wittering puthers all over the loveable eccentrics. So, to sum up BAH The Inheritance Of Loss by <---A>Kiran Desai</---A> is a magnificent, impressive novel that ultimately is disappointing. As a process, the book is almost stunningly good. As a product, it falls short. The book\u2019s language, scenarios and juxtapositions are funny, threatening, vivid and tender all at the same time. The comic element, always riven through with irony, is most often to the fore, as characters grapple with a world much bigger than themselves, a world that only ever seems to admit them partially, and The Inheritance Of Loss by Kiran Desai is a magnificent, impressive novel that ultimately is disappointing. As a process, the book is almost stunningly good. As a product, it falls short. The book\u2019s language, scenarios and juxtapositions are funny, threatening, vivid and tender all at the same time. The comic element, always riven through with irony, is most often to the fore, as characters grapple with a world much bigger than themselves, a world that only ever seems to admit them partially, and rarely on their own terms. The one criticism I have of the style is Kiran Desai\u2019s propensity to offer up lists as comic devices, a technique that works a couple of times, but later has the reader scanning forward to the next substance. An aged judge lives in the highlands of north India. As political and ethnic tensions stretch through the mountain air, he reconsiders his origins, his education, his career, his opportunities, both taken and missed. He has a granddaughter, orphaned in most unlikely circumstances, as her parents trained for a Russian space programme. But what circumstances that create orphans are ever likely? She is growing up, accompanied by most of what that entails. The cook in the rickety mansion is the person that really runs the household, his rule-of-thumb methods predating the appliances he has to use and the services he has to provide. He manages, imaginatively. He has a son, Biju, who eventually forms the centrepiece of the book\u2019s complex, somewhat rambling story. Biju has emigrated to New York, where he has made it big, at least as far as the folks back home think. On site, he slaves away in the dungeon kitchens of fast food outlets, restaurants, both up and downmarket, and a few plain eateries. Kiran Desai provides the reader with a superb image of globalisation when she describes the customer-receiving areas of an upmarket restaurant flying an advertised, authentic French flag, while in the kitchen the flags are Indian, Honduran, anything but French. Now there is true authenticity for you, offered up in its manufactured, globalised form. Biju, of course, dreams of home, but the comparatively large number of US dollars he earns \u2013 at least as far as the folks back home see it \u2013 barely covers essentials in someone else\u2019s reality. The narrative of The Inheritance Of Loss flits between New York, northern India and elsewhere, and also between the here and now, yesteryear and the judge\u2019s childhood. And perhaps it flits too much, because the scenes are often cut short before the reader feels they have made a point. And ultimately this reader found that the book lacked focus. While the process was enjoyable, the product was not worth the journey. The Inheritance Of Loss seemed to promise to take us somewhere in this globalised confusion of identity, motive, routine, unrealised dreams and intangible desires, but eventually it seemed to have nothing to add to a sense of \u201cwell that\u2019s how it is\u201d, which is precisely where we started. There was an opportunity for more, but it was ducked. The book was thus a thoroughly enjoyable read that threatened to achieve greatness through statement, but unfortunately missed the mark, and by a long way. ...more \u0647\u0644

Sure the act is nothing new, but the post 9/11 instability is. This is a lot more striking than you might think\u2014 the basic concept of the immigrant novel, from Amy Tan to Rushdie was co-existence, a belief in the ultimate greatness of mongrel culture; the character finding some way to come to terms and perhaps even thrive in the country of adoption. In Inheritance, two generations of immigrant return and both experience the fundamental instability that comes from divorcing where you're from, but never fitting in with where you're at. ...more i have only read half of this book, so perhaps i shouldn't rate it. but i want to warn other people away from it! the author is obviously an intelligent writer, and she has a real mastery of language. much of the writing is somberly poetic. but perhaps she pays too much attention to detail..... the story is slow..... i read up to the part where the judge returns from england and rapes his wife after she steals his powder puff, and i threw the book down in disgust. it's not just what happens, but i have only read half of this book, so perhaps i shouldn't rate it. but i want to warn other people away from it! the author is obviously an intelligent writer, and she has a real mastery of language. much of the writing is somberly poetic. but perhaps she pays too much attention to detail..... the story is slow..... i read up to the part where the judge returns from england and rapes his wife after she steals his powder puff, and i threw the book down in disgust. it's not just what happens, but how the author writes. the rape scene really made my skin crawl. her description was vulgar. i'm crossing my legs and curling up into a ball just thinking about it. most of the characters are selfish and cynical, if not downright mean. the ones who aren't get treated badly. the environment is moldy and decaying. i felt like taking a shower after reading passages from this book. other reviewers said that the glorious and brilliant thing about this book is the mood the author creates. if you want to read a book with mood, then go for it. she is a genius at creating the most depressing mood you can imagine. ...more While the writing was lovely and the theme of the conflicting Indian identities in post-colonial India and in the United States was really interesting and supported with well-developed characters... but.

The novel moves points of view and location regularly. It shifts between the foothills of the Himalayas near Kalimpong (set in 1986 with the Gorkhaland movement as a backdrop) and New York and periodically goes back to the pre-war colonial period. The main characters centre on the household of Jemubhai a retired judge, Sai (his granddaughter), the cook, Mutt the dog and Gyan (Sai\u2019s tutor who visits periodically). In New York is Biju, the cook\u2019s son who is scraping a living working illegally in New York restaurants. There is also a cast of eccentric characters in the household\u2019s social circle. The novel also moves back to the judge\u2019s past and his time in England studying law, his marriage and his gradual disillusionment. Colonialism and post-colonialism feature as themes as does identity and its loss (and this inheritance moving through generations). The novel is split into short chapters and each chapter into brief fragments which move the narrative along quickly, often between comedy and tragedy. This is a funny book and there are some hilarious moments, often juxtaposed with moments of real pathos and tragedy. There is also a sense of decay and regret and an illumination of human cupidity and delusion; delineated with care and concern. An elderly character, Lola, pontificates about Naipaul\u2019s A Bend in the River; \u201cI think he's strange. Stuck in the past ... He has not progressed. Colonial neurosis, he's never freed himself from it\u201d It is an ironic and telling comment. Desai says that her novel \u201ctries to capture what it means to live between East and West and what it means to be an immigrant\u201d and goes on to say that it also explores at a deeper level, \u201cwhat happens when a Western element is introduced into a country that is not of the West\u201d. Desai also asks \u201cWhat happens when you take people from a poor country and place them in a wealthy one. How does the imbalance between these two worlds change a person's thinking and feeling? How do these changes manifest themselves in a personal sphere, a political sphere, over time?\u201d Desai\u2019s genius is to explore all these themes within the context of a very human and poignant story. The novel tells a compact family tale in broad scope raising issues and difficulties facing the inheritors of colonial domination. Sai\u2019s feelings give a sense of the inheritance; \u201cNever again could she think there was but one narrative and that this narrative belonged only to herself, that she might create her own tiny happiness and live safely within it.\u201d Easy to read and deceptively deep; this is a good novel with much to recommend it. ...more \u0643\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u064a\u0633\u0627\u064a ~

It's not a word I get along with, what with its all too frequent usage as a blockade, a safety blanket, a \"but it's a satire so I can say anything I want?!?!\" that guarantees neither quality nor even simple entertainment, but if there's one example that I'll accept with nary a quibble, it's Swift's A Modest Proposal . It's a piece that makes you laugh while questioning while you're laughing because you are also crying but not nearly as much as you should be while also recognizing the logic that is only the extension of a present day condition that seems practical and common sensical until it isn't because now you're (view spoiler) [eating human babies (hide spoiler) ] . Don't get me wrong, the slippery slope analogy is a fallacy alright, but more fucked up things than government sanctioned (view spoiler) [cannibalism of newborns (hide spoiler) ] has happened on a more official scale. One day the Indian girls hoped to be gentry, but right now, despite being unwelcome in the neighborhood, they were in the student stage of vehemently siding with the poor people who wished them gone. So it's a satire of immigration and all its ways of the Dream, an entity so bloated by desperate whispers and Hollywood explosions and in the case of India postcolonialism/racism/previous cash cow (oh the double entendre) of the ultimate White Man's Burden Spiel that anyone expecting something along the lines of narrative flow is going to have issues. In cowboy tropes you'd call it \"gritty\", but despite the shit and boogers and homeless mental illness and abject poverty without a single shred of sentiment and socially encouraged rape there's no time for macho solipsism when there's lampooning of every single privilege to be done. Granted, there is some but how you feel about it by the end will tell you more about yourself than you are comfortable with imagining. Saeed, he relished the whole game, the way the country flexed his wits and rewarded him; he charmed it, cajoled it, cheated it, felt great tenderness and loyalty toward it. When it came time, he who had jigged open every back door, he who had, with photocopier, Wite-Out, and paper cutter, spectacularly sabotaged the system (one skilled person at the photocopy machine, he assured Biju, could bring America to its knees), he would pledge emotional allegiance to the flag with tears in his eyes and conviction in his voice. The country recognized something in Saeed, he in it, and it was a mutual love affair. Ups and downs, sometimes more sour than sweet, maybe, but nonetheless, beyond anything the INS could imagine, it was an old-fashioned romance. On the scale of The Namesake to The God of Small Things this matches quite nicely within the rating disparities (four stars in the range from two to five) because of its embrace of both horror and happiness. It's also hilarious, which goes a long way in touching on Big Issues that really do need to be considered without being sucked in. As Shaw/Chaplin/Wilde/some dead white guy (the assumption of course but maybe it's wrong) reputedly said, make them laugh, else they'll kill you. It seems to have worked out well in the case of the Booker, but as for the ratings...eh. I'll settle for poking them with a stick. Just ordinary humans in ordinary opaque boiled-egg light, without grace, without revelation, composite of contradictions, easy principles, arguing about what they half believed in or even what they didn't believe in at all, desiring comfort as much as raw austerity, authenticity as much as playacting, desiring coziness of family as much as to abandon it forever. Yes, there's life affirmation and critical theories and a multifarious web of Srs Bzns, but it made me laugh, and it didn't even need a single (view spoiler) [dead baby (hide spoiler) ] to do it. ...more I am very interested in reading books on India since I read Yann Martel\u2019s Life of Pi.

This novel gave me an idea about life of Indians (although I already studied it in our high school History. ) I became more interested when I read A White Tiger by Aravind Adiga from which I learned the real face of social system in India, that people in the lower class get through miserable and sordid life. This fact opened my mind then. Probably, the novel that has had a significant impact upon me so far is Rohinton Mistry\u2019s A Fine Balance, a wonderful book I will definitely recommend to someone asking for what book they should read. Thereby, I always look for the other novels which have something to do with India since there are some included on 1001 Best Novels of All Time. All the above-mentioned books have complete resemblance \u2013 their themes are all about poverty. So when I saw this novel in a book store, I grabbed it because I have now the conception that Indian novels have something to do with India . On the other hand, Kiran Desai\u2019 s has the same hallmark but not as heart-breaking and compelling as Rohinton Mistry\u2019s . The way she wrote it is completely different from the other contemporary writers\u2019 . This novel won the Man Booker Prize in 2006 and National Circle Award in the same year. As a reader, do not underestimate why this is deserving of the said awards. In fact , the novel is not much of a good read beyond my taste ; however, objectively speaking, I agree with another famous Indian writer, Salman Rusdie, that Keran Desia is a terrific writer. First: Desai\u2019s writing style reminds me of Black-American writers\u2019 novels; for example, the Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison. When you read the novel, you can assimilate the story into two interpretive ways either literally or figuratively. In other words, <+++>The Inheritance of Loss</+++> is steeped in latent implications, some kind of esoteric reading. Every sentence appears to be so deceiving that I don\u2019t think you cannot get at what Desai wants to imply figuratively. As a clich\u00e9 puts, \u201c Read between the lines.\u201d So, could you have this knack of writing skill? Dear me! you might beat your head against the wall thinking about the best and most beautiful fragments you could fabricate as long as 7 years as Desai took time to finsih it. Second: The novel is what the social world must know . Its themes deal with the social issues nowadays even since before, not only applicable to India and Nepal but also to every nation in the world which must have the same conditions specifically such as : (a ) American dream also exists in India. The western culture influences the psyches of Indians . Consequently, due to the extreme poverty probably brought about by big population, corruption, and ridiculous so-called Caste System, most Indians are so hapless that they dream of venturing out to the USA. In reality, their life turns out to be more miserable than what they expect to be. (b) The effects of Imperialism and colonial-mentality upon the social system raise awareness among chauvinists and jingoists. In fact, in the novel, Sai\u2019s retired judge grandpa shows an air of aristocracy and I-am- better-than-you attitude upon his arrival in India after long studies and services under the British government. Such social situation also exists in the Philippines. ( c) Secessionism. A political situation that loses the real identity of a nation. The novel also deals with feeling of emptiness, the atmospheric feeling I felt from the beginning to the end. \u201cCould fulfillment ever be felt as deeply as loss? Romantically she decided that love must surely reside in the gap between desire and fulfillment, in the lack, not the contentment. Love was the ache, the anticipation, the retreat, everything around it but the emotion itself.\u201d All the rage in the story is the miscegenation between Sai Mistry and Gyan . I found their mutual understanding ridiculous, but their relationship could be symbolic , for Sai is Indian and Gyan; Nepalese. On the other hand, the only thing that impedes my interest is the Indian words and dialogues with which I am not familiar and beyond my understanding. But I believe this is the essence of writing such book; it only reflects the nationalistic observation of Kiran Desia. Besides, I cannot brush the idea that this novel was as though each story in each chapter had just been patched together as Desai\u2019s successful breakthrough after seven years of writing it. Still, it is a tour de force. Congratulations Ms. Kiran Desai! I envy your febrile imagination. ^^ Prior to this , Desai was already popular among literary critics for her Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard , which I will read as soon as I buy it. ^^ Rating : 5 / 5 stars ...more This is a one of those books that makes me want a sixth star, one that I had to put down constantly to take a moment to close my eyes, see the landscape, ride the emotion, work the thought through, one that dreamed me into a never land that, against the feebleness of my imagination, really exists in the indigo shadows of Kanchenjunga.

It took my breath and squeezed my heart. Along with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah , it is my favourite novel, ever, about migration. I hope I live to read it many times. Desai seems to revel in ambiguity as her mist-shrouded setting attests. When Sai causes the cook to spill flour, it's hilariously unclear whether the weevils or the humans are laughing at each other. Synaesthesia smears like cloud - the judge 'recognises a weakness that was not only a feeling but also a taste, like fever.' The author's embrace of experience has a both/and orientation I associate with black African and diasporic writing traditions. Both Sai's story and Biju's. The judge's and the cook's. Fragments of time lived in heightened states are painted in the glory of their silence or music, and life is the melody: 'Rainy season beetles flew by in many colours. From each hole in the floor came a mouse tailored as if for size'. When she writes about Sai's love for Gyan, she captures the emotion perfectly and hilariously in a scene in which she repeatedly washes her feet. This is a novel in which everything is suggestive, every paragraph hangs in the air like a fragrance or the echo of a chord: flowers augur passion and also death. When she teaches Desai is so brilliant I wanted to leap off my seat on the tube and applaud, I laughed aloud many times. A hotelier shows Sai and her friends a postcard written by a white tourist who they say 'are so scared they'll get taken advantage of because of their wealth they try to bargain down on the cheapest room... And yet, just see \"Had a great dinner for $4.50. We can't believe how cheap this country is!!! We're having a great time, but we'll be glad to get home where, let's be honest (sorry, we've never been the PC types!) there is widespread availability of deodorant\"' This blindness of whiteness, the inability to see the colonial other as a thinking being who knows the language you forced them to learn and can read your inane asinine racist postcards, comes into focus, now I revisit that page and look a few paragraphs behind, where Sai and Noni and Desai reflect on justice and law, and the violence of that blindness and all the destruction wrought by it jolts into mind. Desai works her themes through character and the story has two centres around which they storm and bear their lightning and thunder: Biju, who has migrated to New York city, and Sai, an orphaned middle class teenager living with her grandfather 'the judge' in Kalimpong, a town high in the Sikkim area of the Himalayas where the Nepali Gorkhas are engaged in nationalist struggle against the Indian state. The judge employs Biju's father as a cook (and housekeeper), and so the two families are intimately connected. Biju's narrative is relatively conventional, and Desai uses it to deal with commonplaces; the familiar tale of migrant naivity and sad disillusionment. Non-fiction versions of this narrative are available in millions; I have heard them first hand, second hand, third hand, by hearsay, on the radio, I have read them in memoirs, in poems, on blogs. But fiction in hands like Desai's, in passionate conviction and sparkling sea salt sharpness, has a different power, a power like music, precisely composed to fling open doors of emotion and empathy. Biju's story, doubly, triply outlined in love, gentleness, care, simmers like boiling oil, blazes like hellfire, and throws up dancing sparks that throw keen illumination. On the cave wall we see the binding injustices of colonisation: Biju feels angry that his father has sent him to America, where he is suffering, but he knows that he would feel angry if his father had not sent him. On the cave wall: Biju's attempts to reason through racism, working the strange logics of emotion as he tries to reconcile his affection and admiring respect for a black Muslim man from Zanzibar with his socialised disdain for black Africans and hatred of Muslims. Biju hears from his all-nations workmates (it seems the kitchens of New York are staffed with undocumented people of all countries working for leftover food and minuscule wages) that Indian people are in every country everywhere despised, and thinks 'surely Indians would be preferred' to Pakistanis, against whom he himself is prejudiced. not a spoiler but a personal digression: (view spoiler) [Actually I think this has always been true in my lifetime because of Islamaphobia, whose existence I was rudely awakened to the day I returned from a Muslim cultural centre we visited on a school trip when I was around 12. I was smitten: my ongoing love affair with the culture of Islam and the endlessly variegated 'Muslim world' had begun. I was totally astonished by my father's negative remarks when I gave him a brief routine report on my day that evening, something like 'Muslims are known for being violent, killing people who offend them'. Shortly afterwards a girl with Indian heritage joined my class and became my closest friend (by the way, I grew up in an area with an extremely high majority of white people. There were only 5 people of colour in my entire high school year group of about 200, and my friend was the only one in my class) and helped to propel me into a (parallel, not replacement) passion for Hindu-Indian culture. Nobody objected to this: Hindus were seen as peaceable, earthly, more embodied than 'uptight' Christians/'reserved' white Brits, relaxed yet hardworking, gregarious, cheerful. I am aware of being an essentialising romanticising insatiable other-eater (hide spoiler) ] The cook in India, in his native place, really seems at the wellspring of life while his son is in the grave of 'civilization', that's how it feels to me, whiteness, hegemony, a grave, a junk heap of chewed up trash, with a little tinkling English bell to put on the coffin of the whole beautiful glorious world of difference. Sai lives for a while in a sheltered wing of that world of difference: wearing a red kimono in monsoon season, she is the brightest-shining sign of the theme (picked up in every segment, like a thread running all through a tapestry) of cultural cross-pollination. Like Samarasan's in Evening is the Whole Day , her characters sing the song 'my shoes are Japanese...' thus both authors unwrite the colonial narrative of the Orient(al) as stagnant and static, and cut off at the root the essentialising tropes that produce the orientalist's Orient, in which the brown Other is forced to define herself only against the white Self - going beyond the dialectical step of inversion into more rarefied histories in which brown and black and yellow and red admix and converse unmediated and unsupervised by the white gaze. If Biju is the victim of the soulless USian behemoth, at least he is able to retain some selfhood, some humanity through the ordeal, whereas the judge, an earlier victim of the subtle white supremacy of middle England, is more severely damaged. The discussion of ideas of justice among Sai's milieu reflects on his character, so that I wondered whether he is meant to have an allegorical relationship to a particular philosophical position or text. His cold, cruel, insular behaviour masks a childish vulnerability. It's horribly ironic that 'justice' can be administered by someone so selfish, heartless and immature, even murderously misanthropic. It hints at the atrocities of the British Raj. Yet, the man adores his non-human companion, the bitch Mutt, sole outlet for his strangled capacity for affection. In the judge's often pathetic need for the cook, Desai demonstrates devastatingly that those with power are utterly dependent on those over whom they wield it, and persistently centres the stories of the latter: the relationships of poor people like the cook and his son bind the narrative and the social fabric together, while Sai's friends Lola and Noni and their fellow members of Kalimpong's small educated and rather Anglophile (though this is a gross simplification, they have some (and develop more) critical postcolonial self-awareness, but they are readers of British literature, buyers of M&S knickers) middle class float rootless. Their keen appreciation for the land (and even the reciprocal relationship with it that Swiss national Father Booty has) does not cancel out colonisation or heal its wounds (as brilliantly underscored by Sai's penchant for perusing old copies of National Geographic), and the nationalism that erupts, spilling the deadly lava of racial hatred from the pressure cooker of poverty and disenfranchisement, while it allows some suppressed stories and emotions to be aired, ultimately does no better and inaugurates a new cycle of suffering, like another loop of incarnation. Sai reflects on a range of decolonial viewpoints around the issue of Tenzing and Hilary, noting that the Sherpas scale the peaks 'without glory, without claiming ownership' and that some believe 'the sacred should not be sullied', and asking 'should we aim to conquer the mountain or be possessed by it?' Political themes are also worked through the character of Sai's tutor and lover, Gyan, a poor but educated local Nepali who is rather haplessly becomes caught up in a nationalist protest and feels the wheels of history turning around him, as him. He is at 'the angle of nostalgia, the position of the revolutionary' but 'pulled out' of the feeling by the everyday, by the familiar hills, that bring him to the recognition of the frustration and idealism that has been yoked into nationalism in these young people. Intelligent, he is briefly cynical. A submerged, sudden awareness of Hindu nationalism and colonial legacies stoke a fresh, violent nationalism in him and he rejects Sai with flaring, comically ridiculous hatred, yet Desai contrasts and justifies his position, implying that poorly expressed and half-felt truths have validity and meaning, by paralelling the most hideous part of the judge's narrative, revealing the extent to which the internalisation of white supremacy has dehumanised him. This point is hammered, even crunched home again by the devastating scene of Biju's experience in the US embassy, the vivid portrait of the pushing crowd, the man at the front affecting to be 'civilized, ready for America' whose eyes 'so alive to the foreigners, looked back at his countrymen and women, and immediately glazed over, and went dead'. There was also something sharp in Biju's scam trip to Kathmandu, arriving at a butcher's shop instead of the promised and paid for training camp, but there is a lesson for him nonetheless in seeing the butcher swear at a nanny goat before slitting her throat, working himself into the furious hatred required to kill. The relationship between Biju and his father ('the cook', just as Sai's grandfather is always 'the judge', though both are humanly realised to the highest degree, the cook tenderly and the judge horrifically) epitomises the total love, the unconditional bond of a parent and child. The cook reflects: 'money wasn't everything. There was that simple happiness of looking after someone and having someone look after you.' A wise reader will pocket this, and take it out occasionally to hold and look at it, like a very beautiful shell or pebble. Desai makes virtuoso use of it: in one phone call between the two, she can strike the passion for home and familiy into the heart so deep you know it will stay in you and taint your blood and you will taste it in your tears for the rest of your life. Desai makes the cook and Biju so appealing my love for them hurts. Desai's feminism is evident in the fact that she celebrates two vulnerable, kind, nuturing, subjugated males; they are never, ever degraded by authorial mockery. (Uncle Ballroom in Evening is the Whole Day seems to me to be a similar figure; a caring, vulnerable, generous man whom the narrative affirms and celebrates) In contrast to their tender relationship, Sai has only a single, tenuous family tie to a man who seems to have lost the capacity to love other people, and a large part of her emotional experience is a vicarious concern for Biju through her warm relationship with the cook. As a protagonist she is oddly peripheral to much of what might be called the temporal action, the political scene, which sweeps up Gyan and impacts on Lola and Noni. Sai has grown up alienated from her Indian-ness but she is not foreign in the diminishing sense that Biju is in the US - here is where Desai's diamond teeth bite - everyone is racist. Sai is also outside what I myself felt to be the book's emotional centre: it was Biju I felt for, his ending I waited for white-knuckled with terror, and Sai had to learn that she was not the centre and that the story did not belong to her, just as Lola and Noni had to admit their pioneer pretences were cowardly and colonial. Kanchenjunga has the last laugh, finally possessing them all. ...more With so much incredible praise riding on this book, I really expected more of it.

So basically, I'm deducting points because I was disappointed by the build-up--I mean, the NBCC and Man Booker Prize? I guess that's not entirely fair though. Standing on its own, The Inheritance of Loss gives exactly what it promises. It describes the barren lives of characters that have been robbed of love or dignity or some necessary emotion in life, all juxtaposed against the twin backgrounds of an incredibly lush region of the Himalayas and the snarled jungle of New York City. The novel focuses on Sai, an isolated teenager who was orphaned when her parents died while she was at boarding school. Sent to live with her curmudgeonly grandfather in a dilapidated yet fairytale house, she walks on eggshells around him, too afraid to beg for his love, and ends up being raised by the cook. He, in turn, projects all of his affection on Sai since his own son, Biju, is in New York, struggling and ultimately failing to make a life there. Threaded throughout, there's a lot of interesting commentary about class warfare (literally), ethnicity, and racism. Both Sai and Biju's experiences bring into question the idea of national identity and what it means to be \"Indian\" or \"American.\" The topics are certainly explored in a new way but ultimately remain unresolved, which made the novel seem over-ambitious. With such a wide nest cast over all these characters, their stories and tribulations, we never fully get to understand any of them. And the lack is most apparent in the end, which counts as one of the most unsatisfying endings ever. Not because it is sad--and shockingly it is heartbreaking without even one death--but it just seems like the drama piles on for effect. When you ring a wet rag out, you expect water, and that was not the ending here. My final diagnosis: the book is so lush, it becomes overripe. Pruning needed to happen. ...more Truth be told, I feel like I hated this novel. Alas, I realize that I am being unduly biased against it for a few reasons.

Alas, I realize that I am being unduly biased against it for a few reasons. The primary reason is how lauded it is, including winning an award that I have a special respect for: The Man Booker Prize (2006). This is thus far the most undeserving winner that I have read. To begin with, this novel has no focus; it has some colorful characters, some touching scenes, some inspiring vignettes, an overall well researched amount of data regarding immigration, urbanization, colonization, modernization. On this, Desai does indeed deliver. But, placed together, they are like pieces of a puzzle with most of the box missing. The characters in a story can make up for a lot. Unfortunately, I found myself unable to connect with, empathize with, see nor feel alongside any. Even Sai, the vivacious, admirable young heroine, was exactly that. A character I could admire for her wit and courage. But that was all. Her romance with Gyan I really could never understand; mostly, I found it rather dull and two dimensional, almost unconvincing. The cook, unnamed until the last two pages, was a colorful character whom I felt an affinity for; at times, I felt like I knew him, but barely. His son Biju, was immersed in the panoply of faces that is New York City and although we were told his story, he was really simply another blank face. Sai's grandfather was the worst. I found his past abuse of his wife, his insistence on being a %*+= to everyone within contact, rarely even showing love to those closest to him, inexcusable. He may have had some difficulties in his past, but nothing that excuses him today. Predictably, the only person, thing, being, he will be seen loving is Mutt. I suppose it makes sense, then, that Mutt serves as a sort of voiceless wheel necessary for the climax in the ending of the novel. His role is redemption for the story? For the characters? Merely more evidence of what can go wrong in society? From what I know in history, her documentation of India's slow, reluctant modernization seems accurate, as does this country's ridiculousness of immigration laws, the difficulties inherent in fooling the system for a Green Card (it is not even green!), the concotion of cultures, heritages, traditions, cuisines that iconizes New York City. There is also a decent amount of humour to be found throughout the novel, which is always appreciated when such serious themes are being adressed. Several difficult topics are covered throughout the course of the novel, including the wars, the genocide, the gangs. The intimidation endured by various individuals in the course of the novel; emotional and physical, psychological and physiological turmoil experienced in various dimensions. It is all expressed well. Poetically on the one hand, but somehow the execution falls short. One realizes this only when reading the story as a whole. Problems x, y, z; a through z are adressed, presented, explored, extricated. Then what? Then nothing. It is as if the author is making a statement to the effect, \"Here are all the problems, all the problems with no solutions. The End.\" As a short story, even several short stories, The Inheritance Of Loss would have fared far better. ...more blown away by the ending...

I admit I felt slightly apprehensive, thinking that as a Booker Prize winner it must be a difficult, challenging read. Then the book was chosen as the March title for the SYP Oxford Book Club and I suddenly had both a very good reason and a deadline for reading it. The story is set in Kalimpong in India, far north-east in the Himalayan mountains, near Bhutan and Nepal. I admit I had to look Kalimpong up on a map, as Himalayan geography was never my strongest subject\u2026 The story gripped me within a few pages and transported me completely and utterly to a tiny mountain village on the other side of the world. I could vividly imagine the shabby house where Sai, the main character, lives with her grandfather and their cook, the landscape, plants, smells, even the humidity during monsoon season. I have missed reading stories like this! The book gets under your skin, and it made me feel angry, sad, annoyed and nostalgic as the story progressed. The haunting loneliness that permeates the family lineage of all the characters, the extreme poverty and widespread injustice, the Nepalese insurgency \u2013 uncomfortable to read about but necessary for understanding the culture and history where the story is set. It\u2019s been several days since I finished the book but the story won\u2019t let go, it\u2019s playing on my mind and has inspired me to read more about India, West Bengal, Darjeeling and the conflicts in this area.

It is a mature writing, with insight, sophistication, and a sense of the grandly tragic. The author weaves a series of parallel stories--imageries--about some very different lives, each quixotic, each distinguished with a color of it own. All except one has only one thing in common--they are all cultural implants, all dancing in their separate destinies, spinning towards their fate that makes them destitutes. Even the one exception--Gyan, the tutor--who is not a cultural implant, also becomes alienated from himself through the greater forces of time against which he is powerless. The book is an exploration of what makes us seek or reject our cultural identities, the tragedy that identification brings, and, like a bolt of lightening near the end, gives us the hint of a most ancient seeking that is the primitive archetype of all identities--our physical inheritance. The novel weaves a series of vivid, parallel, worlds of intellect, emotion, culture, and geography, against the backdrop of the Colonial Raj, the 'Mother England', the new Indian republic and its growing pains, and of economic immigrants to the US. The writing is mesmerizing. The Himalayan ranges that blink through the cloud now and then majestically over the horizon remind us of the lofty ideals that are stepped on by the mortals. Abstract and intellectual in its aspirations, the novel is remarkably mature in its absence of proselytism. The younger Desai is one pukka novelist. Read the book. ...more In one of her most memorable speeches, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie reminds her listeners of the dangers of a single story . She puts it incredibly eloquently when she says: \"The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.

She puts it incredibly eloquently when she says: \"The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.\" I propose that The Inheritance of Loss is a satire on America's single story on India. Part of the single story I hear all the time is the sweetness and ornateness of India's culture. This attitude seeps into Desai's writing style, informing it at every turn. She'll write a cute line or two that seems to be entirely sentimental until probed into. Lines like \"This granddaughter whom he didn't hate was perhaps the only miracle fate had thrown his way\" which seems very adorable until all the nuance and irony of the judge's character gets explored. He hasn't had a miracleless life, but he has thrown every good thing away. After a nasty scene of him raping his wife, he continues to place the blame of his selfishness onto everyone else. He's a high payed official in a poor region. Yet he believes that his granddaughter will be his redemption. It's the acerbic, angry touches all through the suffocating sweetness that makes her style so interesting. Also informed by the single story is Desai's sense of character. Everyone in here is a foil to someone else, simultaneously conforming to one stereotype and rejecting another. Nimi and Noni are the archetypes of complacent women beaten down by their nation's patriarchy, where as Lola and Sai, who often appear within the same breath of the others, are the shrew women who refuse to be tamed. Gyan is the patriotic citizen whose perspective is uninfluenced by the West, yet Biju is a totally westernized America loving manchild. The judge's adherence to gender roles seems particularly stern when placed next to the cook's nurturing, worrying influence. What's the point of all these nearby unsimilar people? Desai has to remind those believing in the single story that India is a diverse nation without dumbing her text down to the point where she says overtly that her homeland is filled with people that show basic humanity. And she does it brilliantly. And she has the most important part of a satire. She's funny. Not in a carefree way, however, more of a sad, contemplative way. This book ends with  a man running down a hill immediately after being robbed while another cries more about his kidnapped dog than his countrymen dying all around him.  and it's the most laugh out loud funny scene I've read in a while. Desai calls out the passive observers of tragedy in it, making it bold and angry still at the same time. It's hard to find a book with so much different feeling, without going overboard and being manipulative, but The Inheritance Of Loss pulls it off incredibly. This is a book that requires patience, which is why I'd guess the average rating on here is so low. All the typical factors that are part enjoyment are off here. There's no plot, not a single likeable character, and Desai is not a believer in the \"show don't tell\" ideology. But the thoughts that come through are important to consider in a post colonial world. As an American, this Booker winner felt particularly relevant to me, since it's a critique of attitude which I sometimes share. The Inheritance of Loss gives new perspective to the notion that the world needs westernized. It's a reminder that my attitudes are not inherently right, as it beats in the importance of culture. ...more this was my re-read, but didnot feel so as I had already forgotten many of the pertinent events.

The language is beautiful, the scenery is magnificent. I loved the prose. Only thing I didn;t like much were the last few pages which were too pessimistic and dismal. a few lines from the book : 'Could fulfillment ever be felt as deeply as loss? Romantically she decided that love must surely reside in the gap between desire and fulfillment, in the lack, not the contentment. Love was the ache, the anticipation, the retreat, everything around it but hte emotion itself.' 'The light diminished now, to a filament, tender as Edison's first miracle held between delicate pincers of wire in the glass globe of the bulb. It glowed a last blue crescent, then failed.' a 20 year old young man is leaving home for England for higher studies 'at home his mother was weeping because she had not estimated the imbalance between the finality of good-bye and the briefness of the last moment' when someone throws away the food his mother had lovingly prepared for him 'Undignified love, Indian love, stinking, unaesthetic love - the monsters of the ocean could have what she had so bravely packed getting up in that predawn mush' 'He leaned back so that his face was in the shade and his toes were in the sun, and sighed: all was right with the world. The primary components were balanced, the hot and cold, the liquid and solid, the sun and shade' 'but when he tried to test the depth of her eyes with his, her glance proved too slippery to hold; he picked it up and dropped it, retrieved it, dropped it again until it slid away and hid' this is regarding two new lovers throwing glances at each other.. ...more The Inheritance of Loss is the type of novel where page to page, sentence to sentence, sometimes even word to word, it's almost impossible not to get swept up in the intricate, swirling prose. I mean, take this passage, from the first pages of the book: \"Could fulfillment ever be felt as deeply as loss?

Love was the ache, the anticipation, the retreat, everything around it but the emotion itself\" Of course I can't speak for anyone else, but this is the kind of thing I read for\u2014something that makes me stop, reread, and maybe reread it again, pondering for a bit to let it all sink in, and then reluctantly forcing myself to move ahead with my reading. And that happened several times throughout this novel. Desai is particularly adept at describing the phenomenon hinted at in the above quote\u2014those interior gaps, moments of hesitation when a character's actions and their mental lives are just for a moment out of sync. That brief instant between action and comprehension, and oftentimes in this novel, action and regret. But that's also a big part of the problem. The focus is constantly on lyrical minutia, but step back to look at the overall narrative and a meaningful pattern never quite manages to form. I kept waiting and waiting for all the pieces to fall into place, for all these suspended fragments of description to suddenly achieve unexpected resonance via a later development or disclosure. Not that I necessarily demand full-out epiphany or revelation, but as I arrived at the concluding pages I couldn't help but feel that all of these beautiful observations Desai painstakingly collects and arranges ultimately fail to add up to much, or, perhaps more precisely, fail to add up to nearly enough.
