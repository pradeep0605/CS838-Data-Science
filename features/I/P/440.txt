{"Comments": "With tears still running down my cheeks I'm writing this review. I've started this review several times and I don't think I'll be able to adequately put into words the power in which this novel has moved me. Truely a remarkable story that I, literally, beg everyone who loves historical fiction to read. I will be gushing about this novel for some time to come.<---F> Beautiful</---F>. \u201cOh,<---M> for heaven\u2019s sake</---M>, Isabelle. Paris is overrun. The Nazis control the city. What is an eighteen-year-old girl to do about all of that?\u201d What, indeed. I really didn't know what to expect going into <+++>The Nightingale</+++> . Given the quote about love and war in the blurb, I kind of thought it might be an historical romance set during the Second World War - like the world really needs another The Bronze Horseman - but it turned out to be so much more than that. There are love stories in <+++>The Nightingale</+++> , \u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, Isabelle. Paris is overrun. The Nazis control the city. What is an eighteen-year-old girl to do about all of that?\u201d What, indeed. I really didn't know what to expect going into The Nightingale . Given the quote about love and war in the blurb, I kind of thought it might be an historical romance set during the Second World War - like the world really needs another The Bronze Horseman - but it turned out to be so much more than that. There are love stories in The Nightingale , but that's not really what the book is about. It's about women in wartime, and it's an interesting, moving portrait of the Nazi occupation of France and what this meant for all the wives, daughters and widows left behind . We're told in the book that men always assume war is about them - it's true - so this is the untold story of the home front. These are the women who are forced to house Nazi soldiers, the women who are manipulated into betraying their friends, the women who wish they could fight for their country and the women who secretly do. The main story is about two very different sisters - <---C>Vianne</---C> and Isabelle - who are trying to survive during wartime. Vianne is older and misses her husband (<---B>who is in a Nazi war camp</---B>); she must deal with her rebellious younger sister and the Nazi soldier living in her home, whilst also making sure her daughter doesn't starve. Isabelle is one of those borderline insufferable characters that also inspires affection. She reminds me of fiery, annoying, but ultimately lovable heroines like Scarlett O'Hara from Gone with the Wind and Kitty from The Painted Veil . The best thing about her, though, is her growth. She starts out a naive 18 year old who falls in love with handsome young men instantly, and she later grows into someone wiser. I loved the way her characterization was handled. On that note about falling in love, this book throws up a number of red herrings. When Isabelle instantly falls for Gaetan, I was rolling my eyes and thinking \"oh great. It's that kind of book.\" But don't worry, that isn't the story being told here and Isabelle has a lot to learn. It's a multilayered book and none of the relationships are straight forward. And it's also incredibly sad and moving in parts, as a book about war generally is. Children in wartime are forced to grow up so fast in order to survive. Take, for example, this exchange between Vianne and her daughter: \u201cVianne cupped Sophie\u2019s thin face in her hands. \u201cSarah died last night,\u201d she said gently. \u201cDied? She wasn\u2019t sick.\u201d Vianne steeled herself. \u201cIt happens that way sometimes. God takes you unexpectedly. She\u2019s gone to Heaven. To be with her grandm\u00e8re, and yours.\u201d Sophie pulled away, got to her feet, backed away. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d \u201cWh-what do you mean?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s Jewish.\u201d Vianne hated what she saw in her daughter\u2019s eyes right now. There was nothing young in her gaze\u2014no innocence, no na\u00efvet\u00e9, no hope.\u201d You really get a sense of how the Nazis took over the lives of the French people. How it was subtle and manipulative, built on fear. They gradually caused divisions within communities, scaring people into betraying their friends. It wasn't a perfect book, if there is such a creature. There were some slow parts that could have been shortened or edited out all together. And I wish the author hadn't used a bunch of American terms and measurements. For example, a \"cup\" measurement is not used in France. But whatever, I enjoyed it a lot. In the silence between them, she heard a frog croak and the leaves fluttering in a jasmine-scented breeze above their heads. A nightingale sang a sad and lonely song.

Though both novels are set during WW2 the similarities for me stopped there. All the Light is a magical novel electric with beautiful resounding prose and refined artistry; The Nightingale is a novel motored essentially by clich\u00e9 and exaggeration. Clich\u00e9d writing isn\u2019t just resorting continually to stock phrases (though Hannah does this a lot); it\u2019s also straining for tension through exaggeration to the point where dramatic tension degenerates into melodrama. No surprise that clich\u00e9d phrases often perform a task of exaggeration. - \u201cShe was scared to death.\u201d \u201cShe couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.\u201d The Nightingale reads like YA fantasy fiction. Everything is wildly exaggerated so that WW2 is perceived as a kind of post nuclear holocaust world where this one event utterly eclipses the world we live in. The perspective of the novel is one of hindsight as if all the characters are experiencing not the daily hardships of the war but the totality of all WW2\u2019s horrors. It\u2019s like her research consisted of jotting down every single horror story and deprivation and shoe-horning them all into her story. It\u2019s mostly set in a small town in the middle of France yet this small town is \u201cswarming\u201d with German soldiers, Gestapo, SS, Jews, bomb damage as if the entire war is centred there (I was only surprised Hitler and Eva Braun didn\u2019t have a holiday home there as well). The two main characters are loaded with the ordeals & accomplishments of an entire circuit of resistance members. Isabelle is every SOE heroine rolled into one and Vianne is a kind of female Schindler. Plausibility is often sacrificed to \u201cthrills and spills\u201d. In the space of three pages a Jewish woman is told the Nazis will arrive at her house the next morning. Three paragraphs later \u2013 or two hours later - she has magically acquired false identity papers. Three paragraphs later she is about to cross through a peaceful checkpoint when inexplicably the German guard begins machine gunning everyone as if he got bored just checking papers. He even takes the trouble to shoot the woman\u2019s nine year old child in the back. This is all passed off without explanation as if it were a normal wartime incident. The big surprise though is that the ending is genuinely moving and really well managed. Hence all the gushing reviews. Basically to enjoy this you need to anaesthetize your critical faculties. That done I guess there\u2019s enjoyment to be had because Hannah is a decent storyteller and is good at developing human relationships. No doubt it\u2019ll soon be a Hollywood film. ...more ::: FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED ::: 5 STARS!! ::: HOLY WOW!!! This book was absolutely epic!

A sweeping, breathtaking journey that captivated me from the first page with the strength and beauty of the writing. Truly an unforgettable story! The Nightingale has a 4.8/5 rating average on Amazon (which is HUGE!!) and what that basically means is that practically everyone who is reading it is loving it. And I'm now adding my own 5 STAR rating to that list because this book owned my heart. The ending was so powerful that I read the last 10 pages with tears pouring down my face and days after finishing my read, I still can't stop thinking about it. I will say upfront though that this book was a little different than the kinds I usually read and review though because it wasn't solely focused on a love story, even though there were two love stories within it. While men endure great hardship during war, it affects everyone. This is the often-unspoken story of women's war. Mothers, daughter, sisters, wives... this is the story of their strength, endurance, sacrifice, and courage during the darkest part of their lives. So many of them didn't just wait for their men to return but took many grave risks to save as many other lives as they could. We begin the story in 1995 with an old woman towards the end of her life, moving out of her house into a retirement home. Without much of a future ahead of her, she begins to look backward at her past, taking us with her through her life story beginning in France 1939, right before the war changed her peaceful life. The flash back segments of the book are largely focused on two sisters: the older Vianne, the rule follower, and the younger Isabelle, the rebel. Vianne's idealic life in the countryside with her husband, Antoine, who she'd been in love with since she was fourteen and their young daughter, Sophie, was changed when he was to be mobilized and called to duty to fight in WW2. The postman became a soldier overnight, and the man she loved was sent to the front, leaving her behind not knowing what the future would bring. He stood up slowly and took her in his arms. She wanted to bottle how safe she felt in this moment, so she could drink of it later when loneliness and fear left her parched... \u201cI love you,\u201d he said against her lips. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said but the words that always seemed so big felt small now. What was love when put up against war. Months into her husband's deployment, with no word still from him and with their already-dire situation getting worse and worse after France surrendered to Germany, Vianne and Sophie's lives are once again changed when a young German officer requisitions their home, making it his own. Faced with one hardship after another, they both do everything they can to survive, and pray for Antoine's safe return. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry, Madame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been admonished to act as gentlemen. My mother would demand the same, and, in truth, she scares me more than my general.\u201d It was such an ordinary remark that Vianne was taken aback. She had no idea how to respond to this stranger who dressed like the enemy and looked like a young man she might have met at church\u2026 He remained where he was, a respectful distance from her. \u201cI apologize for any inconvenience, Madame.\u201d \"My husband will be home soon.\u201d \u201cWe all hope to be home soon.\u201d Miles away, Vianne's younger sister Isabelle attends a sort of finishing school for French woman and hates every single moment of it. Her outspoken and rebellious nature unwilling to bow to their rules. When the war comes though, she makes her way through the wilderness to Paris. Her beloved city was like a once-beautiful courtesan grown old and thin, weary, abandoned by her lovers. In less than a year, this magnificent city had been stripped of its essence by the endless clatter of German jackboots on the streets and disfigured by swastikas that flew from every monument. Refusing to accept France's surrender, and despite her sister's pleading to stay quiet and safe, she follows her heart and meets a young man named Gaetan. She falls in love with him and his belief that the French can fight the Nazis from within France. But when things take an unexpected turn, she decides to take matters into her own hands, regardless of what anyone tells her she can't do, and joins an underground group, The Resistance, that risks their lives to make a difference and help save as many others as they can. On this cool October morning, her life would change. From the morning she boarded this train\u2026 she would no longer be the girl in the bookshop\u2026 From now on, she was Juliette Gervaise, code name the Nightingale. You know that feeling when a book is so absorbing that you just want to cancel all your plans so you can keep reading it... and even when you can't read it, you're thinking about it? Yeah, that was me with this book! Once I started reading, I could barely put it down until I'd reached the last page. As the past and present storylines began to entwine, these shivers ran down me as certain reveals were brought into the light. Real shivers. Tears would spring to my eyes with even the simplest of things -- but ones that had such a hugely powerful impact on the story. A letter from Paris. BOOM. Tears. \u201cPlease\u2026 Just say strong and be there for me when the time comes for me to leave this cage\u2026 Because of you, I can survive. I hope that you can find strength in me, too, V. That because of me, you will find a way to be strong. Hold my daughter tightly tonight, and tell her that somewhere far away, her papa is thinking of her. And tell her I will return. I love you.\u201d This book is honest in portraying the events that occurred to these characters, but not overly graphic. It doesn't need to be. The things that happen, and they way they are told are so powerful that you FEEL them. There are some scenes though that are hard to read because they are quite painful and I'll warn that there may be triggers for some people, but then again, this is a story that takes place during a brutal war. There's everything you can expect from such a story -- brutal firefights, prison camps, beatings, near starvation, sacrifice... but there is also hope, resilience, survival. As I neared the end of the book, during the last few pages, tears began to pour down my face. It was achingly beautiful. Many of you will be wondering if there is a happy ending. I don't want to give things away, but I want you to know that I was completely okay with this ending. It's naturally not all sunshine and roses, how can it be with such a setting? But my gut feeling tells me that even hard-core romance fans will still love this book. I was moved to tears several times, but in many ways my heart was healed. \u201cI love you, Antoine Mariac, and I expect you to come home to me.\u201d <---A>Kristin Hannah</---A>'s writing is some of the best I've ever read. It's extraordinarily vivid and evocative. This was my first book by her and I felt like I was right there with these characters -- not only were their emotions so strongly conveyed, but the picture of their surroundings came to life before my eyes. I have searched for years without luck for a book that could even come close to comparing to my all-time favorite book, The Bronze Horseman ( more into here ). This book however, is the closest I\u2019ve ever come to one that captured a similar feeling. The story is vastly different \u2014 while The Bronze Horseman completely revolved around one love story that was the driving force behind the entire trilogy, The Nightingale was focused on two sisters and their experiences surviving the war -- while the sisters each had their own love stories, it was their personal journeys that this book was focused on. I also found TBH to generally be more emotional than TN. So, it\u2019s not of course a direct parallel. But I will say that if you\u2019re a fan of TBH and if, like me, you\u2019ve been searching for years for a similar book, then you absolutely must read this. This was honestly one of the most powerful stories I've read. It will stay in my heart, I know this for a fact. More than anything, what I take away from it is gratitude... gratitude for every single freedom and luxury that I know so many of us naturally take for granted. They are precious. This book reminded me of that. Rating: 5 STARS!! Standalone novel. _______________________________________ For those of you who want to know who lives and who dies... (view spoiler) [ Antoine survives the war and returns home to his beloved wife Vianne and daughter Sophie -- who both also made it. They rebuild their family and eventually begin a new life together in America (although you do not see this in detail, it is implied). Isabelle's rebellious nature and choice to risk her life to save others eventually gets her caught (towards the end of the book). She is beaten almost to death and thrown into a camp. She survives this only barely. When the war is over, she returns home and is reunited with her love, Gaetan. She dies in his arms without regrets for the choices that led her there. The ending of the book is a hugely emotional reunion in 1995 for the survivors of the war.

There's some nice detail about the home front in France, which I have read less about than the English home front. And there are some exciting scenes featuring the French resistance's efforts to get downed pilots out of France. But there are also some small but annoying anachronisms (antibiotics were not really available until after the war; Germans didn't put up signs saying people would be put in \"concentration camps\"). Everything seemed very predictable: a hiding place in the barn is introduced; you just know it's going to figure in hiding Jews later. A kind Nazi is featured, as well as a sadistic one. And the last quarter of the book races through torture and concentration camps and death marches in a way I found tedious and unenlightening. Then there is what is supposed to be a twist at the end, but I felt like I saw it coming. So if you really, really love WWII historicals this might be worth your time, but I've read better from Kristin Hannah and much better about WWII. ...more For me this was a fusion of sub-literary chick lit and WWII fiction in that it was too cliche and melodramatic much of the time.

This story follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, during World War II and their hardships trying to survive. My heart broke for each sister as I read their stories full of loss and pain. And I loved the shifting point-of-view that allowed me to see inside each character's head. But one of the best things about the story for me was Isabelle. I loved her as a main character and her character development was phenomenal. She started out as a impetuous 18 year old, but in order to survive the war, she turned into someone tough and driven and so strong. \u201cShe let fear give her a little shake and she almost gave in to it. Then she thought about the swastikas that flew from the Eiffel Tower and Vianne living with the enemy and Antoine lost in some prisoner of war camp. And Edith Cavell. Certainly she had been afraid sometimes, too; Isabelle would not let fear stand in her way.\u201d Reading from Vianne\u2019s point of view was just as nerve-wracking as reading from Isabelle\u2019s. Herr Captain Beck made me really uncomfortable \u2014 whenever he helped Vianne and her daughter, I felt exactly as torn as she felt. Now I\u2019m starting to get really emotional thinking about Vianne, especially thinking about her friendship with Rachel. Their friendship is so rich and real and it made Rachel\u2019s departure that more emotional for me. I had actual tears running down my face when she helped Rachel and her children escape. Vianne\u2019s character growth was outstanding and it definitely surprised me. \u201cI\u2019ll write if I can,\u201d Rachel said. Vianne\u2019s throat tightened. Even if the best happened, she might not hear from her friend for years. Or ever. In this new world, there was no certain way to keep in touch with those you loved.\u201d This book definitely astonished me. It showed me kindness when I least expected it (Eduardo and Madame Babineau) and it showed me the losses and fears of so many people and their bravery trying to live through extremely difficult times. The story is moving and heartbreaking and the characters interesting and complex. What do I possibly read after this? \u201cHe smiled. \u201cYou have a habit of saying whatever is on your mind, don\u2019t you, Isabelle?\u201d \u201cAlways. Why did you leave me?\u201d He touched her face with a gentleness that made her want to cry; it felt like a good-bye, that touch, and she knew good-bye. \u201cI wanted to forget you.\u201d Isabelle and Ga\u00ebtan made me really emotional. I\u2019m glad we got to see him again after he left her. Their reunion made me smile after feeling sad for so long because of the events in this book. They are so good together. But being happy didn't last long because I found out that the older woman from 1995 wasn\u2019t Isabelle she was Vianne \u2014 Isabella had died right in Ga\u00ebtan's arms.

L\u00e9a, the outspoken, rebel and reckless one, who joins the Resistance after fleeing from the invasion of Paris and Fran\u00e7oise, the older, who has to live under the same roof of a SS during the Occupation. RING A BELL? This novel, many times bestseller in France, borrowed A LOT from Gone with the Wind , which led to many trials (that R\u00e9gine Deforges won, in the end, saying that it was all part of \"a game\" with her editor - Where have I heard that before? Hmm ). Anyway. It seems oh so ironic to me to find so many similarities between The Nightingale and La bicyclette bleue, 1939-1942 , because, you know, I'm resilient, but reading the same story is starting to get old. Of course, of course, I exaggerate, and I'm not saying that Kristin Hannah plagiarized R\u00e9gine Deforges 's novel. As for Gone with the Wind 's parts, there's none here as far as I'm concerned. No. Both authors of these WWII novels must have used the same inspirations is all - especially real testimonies, surely. Yet it throws me off, even if I didn't even like La bicyclette bleue, 1939-1942 - I'm not a fan, but I can't forget the plot either, and Kristin Hannah 's characters don't strike me as interesting enough to follow the same storyline again. I know, I'm talking about WWII settings and I should love and suffer and FEEL for these characters but ... I just don't. They seem very flat and unrealistic to me? Sorry? Oh, and you know what else throws me off? The shameless lack of any researches about the world . Anachronisms everywhere. Post-card France in one meal (I mean, the Baguette, the canel\u00e9s , the ile flottante , Cognac (for reasons), the Lavander and Rosamery (which are Provencal plants but WHY THE FUCK NOT). Vianne & Antoine luxurious - YES, those meals and houses are VERY luxurious for that period of time - lifestyle that their jobs cannot explain . Antoine is a postman, alright? In 1939 his salary should be around 600 francs per year . As for Vianne, as a teacher, she could pretend to 900 francs, tops. How in the WORLD can they have 65,000 francs in the bank?! Tell me, really, I need to know how to multiply my funds like that (if that's explained later in the book, I apologize). Perhaps it sounds like details to you, and perhaps they are. But when I read an Historical novel, more than Historical facts I need for the book to carry me away in another time. I need to BELIEVE in it. I sure don't want to read about some clich\u00e9, too modern world lacking any savor, picturing my country in such a stereotypical way . So fake, really. Not to mention that I found the writing repetitive and too dramatic, the dialogue awkward and way too much telling rather than showing. The Nightingale tackles such an essential issue - indeed I believe that the portrayal of women's role in WWII is VERY important, and I understand why it would appeal to many readers. Yet I can't see myself finishing it, because really, the similarities and clich\u00e9s are killing me. Wasted potential, sadly. They do have the curse words right, though. Merde. PS. This is a detail, but I do not know one Parisian who would INSTANTLY say something along the lines as, \"oh, the bomb must have fallen into the 2nd Arrondissement\". Nope. Streets, districts names like la Bastille or Les Halles , alright, but randomly quoting an arrondissement when YOU'RE NOT EVEN PARISIAN? Pl-ease. Unbelievable - like the whole thing, apparently. The Nightingale is FULL of inaccuracies like this one, and I expected more from the winner of the 2015 Goodreads Choice Award in HISTORICAL fiction . Ugh. ** Three, actually - thanks Anne for reminding me :D For more of my reviews, please visit: ...more I almost didn't read this book and it would have been my loss if I didn't, because I would have missed out on knowing Isabel and Vianne , and the story of their indescribable bravery and volition to save lives in their roles in the French Resistance during WWII. Oh I know this is a work of fiction and these two women are characters in a novel . But I also know as history tells us there were real men and women risking their lives doing the very same things Isabel and Vianne did . A recent article I almost didn't read this book and it would have been my loss if I didn't, because I would have missed out on knowing Isabel and Vianne , and the story of their indescribable bravery and volition to save lives in their roles in the French Resistance during WWII. Oh I know this is a work of fiction and these two women are characters in a novel . But I also know as history tells us there were real men and women risking their lives doing the very same things Isabel and Vianne did . A recent article tells how Hannah based the story on real events and real people . \"The subject of \u201cThe Nightingale\u201d was an outgrowth of research Hannah had done for her earlier novel \u201cWinter Garden,\u201d when she came across information about a Resistance heroine \u2014 the 19-year-old Belgian woman Andr\u00e9e de Jongh. This brave teenager, inspired in turn by the earlier World War I heroine Edith Cavell, established the Comet Escape Line, a secret network of people who risked their lives to help Allied servicemen escape over the Pyrenees to Spain. De Jongh\u2019s story inspired Hannah to conduct further research into the French Resistance, finding stories about women who had put themselves and their children in peril by hiding Jewish families. And de Jongh became the model for Isabelle, the younger sister, who, as \u201cthe Nightingale,\u201d personally led downed Allied pilots over the mountains to safety.\" ( Seattle Times February 22, 2015) The story is all encompassing in many ways , depicting not only the war , the holocaust, the suffering and starvation, the death , the concentration camps , the emotional, physical and mental toll on people and the unrelentingly will of the people in the Resistance . We see the depth of friendship between Vianne and Rachel , a mother's or father's love for their children and the sacrifices they will make to save them with Vianne and Sophia and with Julian and Isabel and we see the raw innocence of first love that becomes a deeper love with Isabel and Gaetan . I almost didn't read this because I had previously read two other books by Hannah , one of which I loved and one that I didn't , but I could not continue to ignore the 4 and mostly 5 star ratings that so many of my Goodreads friends gave this book . These are friends who are drawn to the same books that I have loved . I'm glad I paid attention to them . My Goodreads friend Evelyn said that by the end of the book she couldn't breathe. I think that she described the feeling perfectly. I wonder why it is that the books that make me feel like I can't breathe are the ones that I love the most . I think it's because these books evoke the feelings that make us human. In this case it is a story that begs us to remember what happened. I couldn't recommend it more . ...more The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah may be my favorite novel of 2015... and yes, I realize it's only February. It's just that good.

It's just that good. The setting is World War II, Nazi-occupied France. The story follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, and how they each respond in times of great challenge. Their parallel stories are as different as their personalities, but are just as suspenseful, complicated, and emotional. Although The Nightingale is considered fiction, it is firmly planted in well-researched truth. Isabelle's character is based on the late Andr\u00e9e de Jongh (1916-2007), an amazing woman who repeatedly risked her life helping British and American servicemen escape on foot from Nazi-occupied Belgium and France. You can read more about the woman herself HERE . Sadly, Andr\u00e9e de Jongh is only one of the many quiet heroes that our future generations will likely never know if not for inspired authors like Kristin Hannah . The Nightingale offers a story of women surviving in unthinkable circumstances - the underestimated gender finding a way to take action. It shows readers that at times protectiveness requires dangerous risks, fear often proceeds acts of bravery, and those who may appear weak can indeed possess incredible strength. I didn't want this book to end because it's not just about the ravages of war, it's also about love, life, and rebellious courage. These women, who had everything (and everyone) to lose, put it all on the line to help others. I have been spared from the direct horrors of war, but I asked the same question that Ms. Hannah herself asked in an interview about her book, \u201cI found myself consumed with a single, overwhelming question, as relevant today as it was seventy years ago: When would I, as a wife and mother, risk my life \u2014 and more important, my child's life \u2014 to save a stranger?\u201d Most of us wouldn't. But which is worst: The fear of the risk or the fear of letting children grow up in a world where good people do nothing to stop evil? I cannot recommend this book highly enough. My favorite quote: \u201cIf I have learned anything in this long life of mine, it is this: in love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are.\u201d Note: Isabelle started out her life as an unruly child, but her tendency to rebel led to great things. If you're raising a hellion yourself, just hang in there \u2013 you never know what their independent spirit might develop into! ...more Kristin Hannah is a pro in the chick-lit genre, and I applaud her efforts to break into historical fiction with The Nightingale. Unfortunately, I cannot say that I loved the result. When I read historical fiction in a war setting, I expect a certain rawness that just wasn't delivered here. Yes, she included historically accurate descriptions of carnage, but the tone was destroyed with a barrage of trite elements.

Unfortunately, I cannot say that I loved the result. When I read historical fiction in a war setting, I expect a certain rawness that just wasn't delivered here. Yes, she included historically accurate descriptions of carnage, but the tone was destroyed with a barrage of trite elements. The two main characters happen to be beautiful, irresistible, young sisters with daddy issues. Of course! Isabelle is a rebellious, virgin brat who engages in her first act of passion with a handsome, bad-boyish, older guy who doesn't seem to notice that they are both starving, injured, stinking to high hell, covered in blood, and stuck outside after running for days from enemy planes and bullets. Vianne, the older sister, is equally beautiful and naive, but also disgustingly helpless, fragile and unable to think for herself. I daydreamed of slapping her several times. Character development allowed for some improvement in the women, so they weren't totally unlikable throughout the book. However, they never felt real. They felt like Hollywood characters: The perfect actresses who play the roles of average people. I think I threw up in my mouth a bit with the addition of a strikingly handsome, kind Nazi acting as some type of Prince Charming on his time off from beating and killing people. Between the lines I read: \"Oh yes, Mr. Nazi, you're irresistible, let's enjoy forbidden moments and fall in love, and hope the reader actually enjoys this bullsh!t.\" My complaints aside, I didn't rate this book too poorly because there were good parts. The Nightingale offers historically accurate details, moments of intrigue, and even some glimpses of true female strength. It simply lacked a consistent, believable tone. The unnaturalness and many nuances constantly jarred me away from the WWII setting. I liked the end most of all, so I suggest finishing the book if you start it. My recommendation: If you're a big chick-lit fan, this book may be for you. On the other hand, if you prefer literary fiction or just want to read a great war novel, look elsewhere. ...more Everyone should read The Nightingale !!

It is now on my list of best books ever! I got the notice that my request for this book was in last night on the \"cloud library\" and once I started reading, I couldn't stop. The tears are still streaming down my face as I write this review. The book is set during World War II in France, occupied by the Nazi's. The story focuses on two sisters (Isabelle and Vianne) who had a difficult upbringing and who couldn't be more different. How they survive the war and navigate through this period is compelling. Hard times are described realistically -- death, starvation, sacrifice, atrocities, heartbreak, love in the time of war.... I don't want to give too much of the plot away -- please read it -- you won't regret it!! This book also depicts how women were able to help in the war. Not only by supporting their families to survive, but also by hiding Jewish children and escorting Allied pilots to safety. I love how Hannah depicted these little-known stories. This was my first book by Kristin Hannah ... I will be seeking out more! ...more Oh my goodness, I loved it. I loved it so much. I haven't felt this invested in a book for a long time. Those addictive, fast paced YA books come and go - think Heartless , a 2016 favorite of mine.

I haven't felt this invested in a book for a long time. Those addictive, fast paced YA books come and go - think Heartless , a 2016 favorite of mine. And then there are those rich, descriptive adult books that fill you up with new knowledge - like The Martian and The Wonder . It's rare when a book combines both of these things. And that's exactly what The Nightingale somehow, brilliantly managed to do. This book takes a look at two sisters living in France during World War Two. No one believes the Nazis will invade France, but that's exactly what happens. We follow Vianne's side of the story; her sadness as her husband is drafted and she's left to look after her young daughter by herself. When a Nazi general moves into her house, things become even more complicated. Then there's Isabelle, Vianne's eighteen year old impulsive, reckless sister whose hatred toward the Nazis drives her to join a French Resistance group. But passing out pamphlets isn't enough, and soon Isabelle is caught up in a dangerous, secret rebellion. I loved Vianne and Isabelle so much. They were strong women who were put through the worst. They showed the females' side of the war. As Isabelle said, most people thought of men being involved in war, but didn't remember the female pilots, medical workers, or women back home surviving until their husband's return. \u201cMen tell stories,\u201d I say. It is the truest, simplest answer to his question. \u201cWomen get on with it. For us it was a shadow war. There were no parades for us when it was over, no medals or mentions in history books. We did what we had to during the war, and when it was over, we picked up the pieces and started our lives over.\u201d The writing was so gorgeous and it astounded me how exciting the plot was. You would think the average 400+ page adult historical fiction would be pretty boring, right? I know I did, and I was so wrong. The tense plot had me ripping through the pages as Isabelle manipulated her way into Paris or Vianne slept under the same roof as a Nazi. Ironically, I just finished another WWII book, Blood for Blood , and I said how brutally it showcased the horrors of the Nazis - but The Nightingale makes that book look nice in comparison. Make no mistake - this book has rape, torture, death, and doesn't shy away from details of children going hungry or women being sent to concentration camps. But I hugely appreciated the detail, even if it made me flinch or tearfully want to skip ahead, because it put me in the minds of two survivors. I felt their suffering, pain, and determination. A beautiful, heartbreakingly honest story. ...more \u03a4\u03bf \u03c5\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf \u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc

I can see why this book is loved by many and it really does warrant all the high ratings. It\u2019s written in such a raw and poignant manner I think every reader will be moved in some way by the tragic beauty in this story. Also, this review will be weird and shorter than normal because: A) I\u2019ve been distracted lately and have lost the ability to review B) This was a really good book and that right there says it all There are two main female leads, sisters Vianne and Isabelle Mauriac and the story is told through both of their POVs. Vianne is the more passive woman who easily conforms and Isabelle is the fierce rebel. I think what surprised me the most was that even though I\u2019m usually drawn to strong, independent characters like Isabelle it wasn\u2019t her that stood out to me \u2013 it was Vianne. I\u2019m a sucker for in-depth character development and seeing Vianne become a stronger, tougher, more assertive woman as the plot progressed made me root for her. Isabelle\u2019s character didn\u2019t change \u2013 once a rebel, always a rebel. I did think some of her actions were childish in the beginning and lacked maturity but I also got that in war times nothing else matters besides life and death. It was equally heartwarming and heartbreaking to read about their sisterly bond and strained relationship with their father, and the sacrifices both made to survive. There\u2019s also a German captain who I felt SO much for. I cried a lot while reading this book and one of the reasons I did was because of him. Usually if a book keeps my attention and makes me ugly cry it\u2019ll automatically go onto my favorites list. While I liked this book immensely, my problem with it is that there wasn\u2019t anything else that made it stand out among the many, MANY other war stories I\u2019ve read. The commonality for these kinds of books is that they will: 1. Make me cry 2. Be extremely riveting and keep my attention 3. Be read in one sitting And that was the case with The Nightingale: nothing more, nothing less. Just like those other war stories, this one\u2019s unforgettable in its own way, but didn\u2019t make me want to jump on rooftops and scream to the whole world that this was a one of a kind book. Personally, I feel like those who\u2019ve read many books with this same setting will like it, but also find little that makes it an outstanding read but those that want to dip their toe into historical fiction will find this to be a big winner. Either way, happy reading to all! ...more NIGHTINGALE is an excellent WW2 novel, but, in some instances, not unlike others of its kind. It explores the horrors of war via occupation by the Nazi's, their brutality and mass murdering of Jews, and the despicable treatment in concentration camps. What separates this work of historical fiction from all the rest is the emphasis placed on the important part women played during wartime.

What separates this work of historical fiction from all the rest is the emphasis placed on the important part women played during wartime. The amazing stories of bravery by two sisters, Vianne who struggles to keep the home fires burning while battling starvation and invasion by SS Officers, and the rebellious and beautiful Isabelle who joins the resistance full steam ahead by passing secret messages day and night and smuggling downed pilots through treacherous mountains so they can fight another day. There is, of course, a wonderful love story intertwined with all the inhumanity as well as a most interesting end to the novel.

I like a good cry once in awhile. What I wasn\u2019t expecting was the sob fest I would get while reading this incredible book. It has been a long time since a book has brought me to so many tears, and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a bad thing. Just that this book was heartbreaking and at times very difficult to read because of the subject matter. Most of all it was a complete eye opener for me. I have never been a fan of historical fiction. But having read almost all of Hannah\u2019s books, including Winter Garden, which was historical and I loved it, I decided to give this book a try. History was my least favorite subject in school, and I retained very little information about the Holocaust and the Nazi\u2019s, other than obviously how completely awful it was. Clearly Hannah did a lot of research for this novel because, even though it\u2019s a work of fiction, it felt so true to life and it completely devastated me. The horror people went through during those times is unfathomable to me. And I lived it through the eyes of these two sisters. It broke my heart over and over again. So much that I can\u2019t stop thinking about the book still today. The book starts in 1995 from the POV of an older woman who\u2019s son is about to put her in an assisted living facility, then it takes you to France in the 1940\u2019s. As this woman is reminiscing about her life during WWII, you don\u2019t know who she is until the very end of the book, and that was brilliant on Hannah\u2019s part. Although the flashbacks to France and the war are incredibly difficult to read, I couldn\u2019t put the book down because I had to know who the woman was at the end. And I needed to know what happened to these two sisters in the story, more than I needed sleep last night. Seeing the war through their eyes was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read before. Hannah\u2019s prose is beautiful, her writing flawless. I have always loved her novels and have rarely read one without crying, but this book was by far the most emotional novel I\u2019ve ever read. Beautiful and tragic at the same time, this book will stay with me for a very long time. If you are a fan of historical fiction, this is a must read. If you haven\u2019t read Kristin Hannah, I recommend you add her to your list immediately! Just make sure you have a box of tissues close by. And trust me, every single book of hers is worth all the tears! ...more Love & War. Family & Foe. Life & Death.

In all honesty, it felt realistic considering the setting. I know now what matters, and it is not what I lost. It is my memories. Wounds heal. Love last. We remain. Buddy Read with Pavlina!

All of these things for some sadistic idiot. I can never understand the things people do to other people, they still do! The story of Vianne and her sister Isabelle is something that gets inside of your heart and makes you route for them and for all they do. Your on the edge of your seat through a lot of it!

There is a WW11 identity card of a young French women, named Juliette Gervaise. As the story transports to France, 1939, we are wondering about Juliette Gervaise... and the elderly unnamed woman in 1995 ... and how they are connected to the story, ( we don't find out until towards the end). We meet the Rosingal sisters: Vianne and Isabelle. ( when war was still in the 'threat-stage'). Their personalities are different. Vianne is 10 years older, married with a child....and lives in the country. Her husband is sent off to war. Isabel has just been been kicked out of - yet another- boarding school. She is 18 at the start.. and sent back home to live with her father in Paris. The sisters father had abandon them years ago ( ages 14 & 4), after their mother had died, by dropping them off, with the caretaker out in the country. So, Isabel knows her dad is not going to be very happy to have her back home. When the Germans invade Paris, her father sends Isabelle to live with Vianne. As a result of the Nazi occupation, a German soldier is stationed at Vianne's house... And Isabelle ends up going back to Paris because her attitude, defiance, and rebellion, is putting Vivianne and her daughter Sophie in danger. Isabelle and Vianne both have different perspectives and reactions to the injustices of war. They both are standing for what they believe is right, they both have courage, and both show compassion in different ways. As the story moves on we see the sisters reconcile and/or at least acknowledge their differences. Through the storytelling -we see how the Nazi's treated France - ( and what police officers did to their own French people- especially 'all' Jews. ( The roundups, the hiding, and the deportations). The history is haunting & horrific. The real emotional impact of \"The Nightingale\", is towards the end of the book. It's hard not to 'feel' something..... Yet parts did not feel authentic to me...with scenes and dialogue being over exaggerated. Parts were predictable, and clich\u00e9. I think I'm the rare bird with novel. 3.5 rating. ...more THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah is a historical fiction novel that takes place during World War II, in France, occupied by the Nazi's.

I couldn\u2019t put the book down because I had to know who the woman was at the end. Just brilliant! This is the tale of the two very different sisters, Viviane, and her younger sister Isabelle - who are trying to survive during wartime. Vianne and Isabelle, different in so many ways, will both embark on separate journeys. Surrounded by danger, these sisters learn about love and loss. Vianne feels responsible for keeping her younger sister, Isabelle, safe. When the occupation begins, Isabelle is sent to stay with Vianne, being cast out of Paris by her father. Vianne's husband, Antoine, has been called to report to the Army, leaving Vianne and their young daughter, Sophie, behind. As the Germans invade Paris, Isabelle begins the journey to her sister's home. When Isabelle arrives on Vianne's home, she is determined to join the resistance and make a difference. Young and impulsive, Vianne is certain that her younger sister will get herself, if not all of them, killed. I have to say that this is not my genre of choice, but after being invited by a Goodreads member to join their Buddy Read, and not making it in time, I still felt obliged to read this book now. All I can say is what an emotional and gut-wrenching novel this was to read. I couldn\u2019t put the book down, once I started it. I had to know what was going to happen to my friends. This is one book where you will need to keep your Kleenex handy. This book had me in tears. This is the story of two sisters, told through both POVs, of the bravery of Vianne who struggles at home to provide for her children, battling starvation and invasion by SS Officers, and Isabelle who joins the resistance passing secret messages day and night and smuggling downed pilots through the mountains. The story covers not only the war, the holocaust, the suffering and starvation, death , the concentration camps , but more than that the will of people to survive. My favorite quote: \u201cIf I have learned anything in this long life of mine, it is this: in love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are.\u201d A very emotional read! ...more 'The Nightingale' is a historical fiction, set in German-occupied France during WWII.

By the time that Isabelle arrives on Vianne's doorstep, she is determined to join the resistance and make a difference. Young and impulsive, Vianne is certain that her younger sister will get herself, if not all of them, killed. Their relationship is tenuous, at best, and Vianne struggles to get through to her strong-minded sibling. Vianne is naive, having not witnessed the actions of the invading Nazis, as her sister had. She believes that if they keep their heads down and don't draw attention to themselves, they'll be okay. She follows the rules and tries to reign in Isabelle's defiant behaviors before it is too late. However, as time passes and the occupation grows increasingly difficult, the sisters go their separate ways. Each of them sets out on a different course, trying to survive the best way they know how. Despite the distance between them, each sister ends up fighting the Nazi invasion in different ways. The bold and daring Isabelle actively assists allied airmen in their escapes, while the mild-mannered Vianne begins helping hide away Jewish children. While there was romance in this book, it took a back stage to the war story. However, this gripping story held my attention from start to finish. I listened to the entire audiobook in one day, without stopping. This is a beautifully written, inspiring story. I loved every minute of it!

This isn\u2019t a history book, and I wasn\u2019t concerned with historical accuracy as much as it just didn\u2019t work for me as well as it did for others. It felt a bit like a YA version of something like Nancy Drew. Good enough, but not great, not \u201cAll the Light We Cannot See.\u201d For me, where this story really shines is toward the end of the book. The real history haunts us, we read about it, hear stories about it, and we try to push it to the back of our minds, if momentarily, enough so we can go through our days, do the shopping, mow the lawn, go to work. I was moved by reading this, but you can\u2019t help but be moved with even the mention of those days, the horrors, man\u2019s inhumanity to man never gets to the point where one will say \u201coh, that again.\u201d I\u2019m glad that this reaches an audience, for me, that is enough. ...more Holy Jesus.

Today\u2019s young people want to know everything about everyone. They think talking about a problem will solve it. I come from a quieter generation. We understand the value of forgetting, the lure of reinvention. Lately though I find myself thinking about the war and my past, about the people I lost. Lost. It makes it sound as if I misplaced my loved ones; perhaps I left them where they don\u2019t belong and then turned away, too confused to retrace my steps. They are not lost. For those readers out there that value writing over story, this is most likely not the book for you. Don\u2019t misunderstand me it is not that this is poorly written, not at all, but the prose does not exactly sing. You will not find passages that leave you breathless or that you feel the need to go back and read again. Rather I would describe the writing as being highly accessible and extensively serviceable. But the narrative flows. There is beauty to be found in simplicity and in this case it enables the story to take centre stage. The story opens on the Oregon Coast in 1995 where an elderly woman is preparing to leave her home of many years. I close my eyes and in the darkness that smells of mildew and bygone lives, my mind casts back, a line thrown across years and continents. Against my will-or maybe in tandem with it, who knows anymore? - I remember. And we find ourselves in France in 1939 on the cusp of war. This is not another story about men at war. Instead it focuses on the women left behind, most notably: two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, and how each of them responds to Germany\u2019s occupation of Paris and ultimately all of France. And it is here in the character development of these two vastly different women that Hannah really shines. Vianne, the older of the two is married and waits patiently for her husband\u2019s return from war. Her approach in the beginning is quieter, more accommodating, keeping the home fires burning, her daughter safe and embracing invisibility by not making waves or standing out in any way. Isabelle is much younger and openly rebellious and reckless; she simply cannot abide these German soldiers and fails to understand how Vianne can be so polite. She fumes, is unable to bite her tongue and is eager to join the resistance and play her part in reclaiming France. The thing about time though is that it marches on, and as it does the German\u2019s unleash their atrocious brutality; rendering blistering scars on France and its people, while the days pass and time it would seem remains indifferent to the suffering caught within its trembling web. The change that occurs within these two women as they each in their own way cope with the ravages of war is brilliantly mastered by Hannah. They each of them over the course of time, make mistakes, big ones, the kind that puts others, even loved ones, at risk and leave these women struggling and near defeated by their own culpability. Kristin Hannah says that she found herself consumed by a single question. When would I as, a wife and mother, risk my life and more importantly, my child\u2019s life to save a stranger? That question is at the very heart of The Nightingale. It is a question that haunts me still. I believe that this is Hannah\u2019s magnum opus and I feel privileged to have read it. ...more", "Title": "The Nightingale"},
