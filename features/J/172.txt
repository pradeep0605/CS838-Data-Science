{"Comments": "I loved this book. It was a beautifully written and contemplative novel about the lengths people will go to find ones they love and escape their past. It looks interestingly at themes of personal transformation, nature, and family ties. Boyden utilizes the dual narration excellently; both voices are clear and strong.

It satisfied me by making me care deeply for its cast of characters, feel connected to their challenging rural environment, and empathize with the plight of Native peoples trying to sustain some identity in the larger society. Most of all I was impressed with the courage the key characters find to take action in the face of threats to their family. We are treated to two narrative voices. One is <---C>Will Bird</---C>, the Cree son of the character in \u201cThree Day Road\u201d, who is largely retired from a long career as a bush pilot for sport tourists and thrives on subsistence hunting, fishing, and fur trapping. The other is a niece in her 20s, Annie. She, her sister Suzanne, and their mother, Will\u2019s sister, are about the only family Will has left, as he lost his own wife and children in some disaster in the past which slowly gets revealed. Will is telling the story of his life to his nieces, and Annie is telling her story to Will. Soon we learn that Will is speaking from a point where he is hiding out in a remote hunting camp on an island in the northern wilderness, and Annie is recounting her story from his bedside at a hospital where he lies in a coma. The mysteries of how these points were reached was pretty damned effective as a plot device to hooking me into their intersecting stories. The main setting is Moosonee, a town of less than 2,000 on the Moose River near its entrance to the tip of James Bay. The site of an old French trading post, it is accessible by water, rail, snowmobile, and airplane, but not by road. A larger settlement and historical site of a 17th century trading post of the Hudson Bay Company, Moose Factory, is nearby on an island in the river, accessible by boat or ice bridge in the winter. The island is the site of a Cree reserve, more significant commerce, a hospital, and, in Will\u2019s youth, where he was forced to attend a residential school after his parents died. This outpost of civilization is called the gateway to the Arctic, and I could feel that aspect as a fulcrum for my understanding of Canada as a whole. The clarity of perspective of man versus nature was brought home to me in an early passage in the book, where Will recounts surviving a plane crash. The quote serves to illustrate Boyden\u2019s unassuming and engaging prose and delightful comic edge to serious situations: And when the cloud cover left on a winter afternoon a hundred miles plus north of Moosonee in January, the cold came, presented itself in such a forceful way that I had two choices. The first was to assume that the cold was a living thing that chased me and wanted to suck the life from me. I could get angry at it, desperate for some sense of fairness in the world, and then begin to panic. Or my second option was to make up my mind that the cold, that nature, was just an unfortunate clash of weather systems. If I made my mind up this second way, that the physical word no longer held vengeance and evil just beyond the black shadow of spruce, then I would try to make do with what I had. And when I realized what an idiot I was for ending up here all alone without the proper gear\u2014just a jean jacket with a sweater under it and running shoes on my feet\u2014I\u2019d get angry, desperate for some sense of fairness in the world, and begin to panic. Me, I preferred the first option, that Mother Nature was one angry slut. She\u2019d try to kill you the first chance she got. From the beginning we learn that Suzanne has disappeared with a boy from a family of local smugglers and drug dealers. Annie is preparing to go after her. Her journey takes her first to Toronto, where she learns her sister found work as a model and her boyfriend somehow make enemies with drug dealers there, leading to another disappearance. Among the homeless Indians there, Annie meets an elder who gives her spiritual guidance and assigns a man who is unable to speak, Gordon, to stick with her and protect her on her quest. Their relationship as they try to negotiate the alien urban landscape was wonderful to watch unfold. As the trail takes them to New York City and their money runs out, Annie\u2019s inner strengths and competence as a country girl gives her the courage to follow Suzanne\u2019s path in work as a model in the fashion industry. Gordon provides an anchor as Annie gets too close to the edge of the dissolute wild lifestyle of the high flying crowd and faces the corrupting force of using her heritage to serve as an exotic, ephemeral star of New York society. For classic character development and a fish out of water, this story fits right up there with that of Dorothy in Oz. Another aspect of the writing that works so well for me is the interior dialog of the characters with their most significant family members in the face of isolation and danger. For example, at the beginning of the book, Will begins to get the message he must take some extraordinary action after he gets beat up by the gang of the brother of Suzanne\u2019s boyfriend: I don\u2019t know how long I lay there. Something, someone maybe, told me that I eventually had to surface if I was going to live, and believe it or not, it was a tough decision to make. For me, my life\u2019s been hard, and sometimes I\u2019m so tired out from losing things I love it feels easier to just give up and slip away. A voice I knew, the voice of my father, talked to me, and in my head I saw him squatting beside me in the black, on is haunches, his one real leg bent under him, his wooden prosthesis straight out in front like one of those fancy Russian dancers. \u201cIt\u2019s not you that you live for,\u201d he said to me in Cree.<---F> \u201cIt can\u2019t be</---F>. It\u2019s the others.\u201d Not very specific but I knew who he was talking about. \u201cWhat do I got to give to anyone?\u201d I asked. I could tell he was looking down on me, staring at my wounds. He didn\u2019t answer my question. I don\u2019t know about you, but I was well moved by the power of Boyden\u2019s plain prose to make windows and doors between the natural world and the isolation of the soul. Native peoples aren\u2019t alone in clinging to the wellsprings of family and cultural roots when the going gets tough. I leave you with a passage that gives me some delicious chills as the epitome of the human condition, not too far from the spirit of Robert Frost: I\u2019ve come to a strange place on this road. I\u2019d gotten used to this travel, a type of comfort in the slow plod forward, until I came to here. I hear water rushing not so far away, a big river\u2019s voice. I\u2019m scared of it, me. I\u2019ve not truly felt that feeling so strong till here. Something\u2019s there, through the black spruce, just on the other side. I can\u2019t see it yet, though. I can\u2019t see the stretch of water. I have to walk closer if I\u2019m to see it. The sound of rushing water, it makes me feel like drowning. The water closer to shore babbles like children\u2019s voices. The sound makes me want to go to it. But I\u2019m afraid. ...more Update: The CBA (<---B>Canadian Bestsellers Association</---B>) have handed out the 2009 Libris Awards.

I was transfixed with the two main characters, in this follow-up to Three Day Road. If you haven\u2019t read Three Day Road, read it first to better appreciate this second, more contemporary story. It takes place in Northern Ontario (Will and Annie), and in Manhattan (Annie). Two separate stories of two people struggling to find themselves. Stories of the traditional Cree living off the land(both characters), and Annie\u2019s two diverse worlds: from strong female trapper, to becoming a model during her search to find her missing sister. Through the telling, we feel the desire in each to find themselves, and in turn, reconnect with one another. Family is at the heart; a quest, the driving force. <---A>Joseph Boyden</---A> is a born storyteller.

Thank you. __________________________________ Happy to have made this the final book in my 2011 GR reading challenge. Great characters, unique setting, remarkable dialogue and voice. Highly authentic evocation of the Canadian Aboriginal perspective and experience from a bunch of different angles - deeply moving, atmospheric, a spiritual journey embedded in a real one (two, actually) across the rural northern landscape and the southern cities of Toronto, Montreal, NYC. The structure - two voices, uncle and niece - telling each other their stories in alternating chapters was beautifully handled, never gimmicky. The dialogue sounded was so authentic -- I have northern Ontario ears (slightly out of practice), and I could hear these voices clear as ice in my head. Ever good, eh? So much to love - but here's the nub of it, my favourite thing, the most horrible thing really but this novel nailed it so perfectly and with such subtle power: the subjugation of Aboriginal culture, spiritual identity, individual personality, the vitality and destruction of family relationships, the impossibility of assimilation leading to the obliteration of choice, cultural genocide -- these horrific, heartbreaking things ran like a river through this book at a visceral, yet submerged, only rarely surfacing, level. Never hammer-over-the-head political, but there - as theme, as imagery, as symbolism, as setting. So bleak, and yet also strangely optimistic (by the end), or perhaps the better description is resilient. Just a huge testament to resiliency, and therefore hopeful. Every now and then, I thought: this book is treading dangerously close to cliche. Symbolically (I mean, c'mon - the bears? the stoic, silent Indian?). Yet, every time I heard a slight warning bell in my head, the authenticity of the voice, the veracity of the detail, won me back over. And at the heart of it, a great story. Truly, truly love this book. ...more After the achievement that was \"The Orenda,\" I found this one super disappointing. Orenda, published later, shows a huge leap in maturity for this author.

The perspective of Annie was relentlessly two-dimensional, as was Boyden's portrayal of the model socialite life in New York. I realize that this milieu is notoriously superficial, but Boyden did nothing other than echo stereotypical dialogue of vapid twentysomethings without offering any real insight into their lives. Nor did he really offer any insight into the subjectivity of beauty, but really just repeatedly highlighted how utterly beautiful his female protagonist is. God knows a female protagonist can't be interesting unless she is exceptionally beautiful! Yawn. I have also noticed that Boyden displays a pattern in his writing of having his female protagonists saved from rape by men that ultimately become their \"protectors.\" For an author who writes so honestly about racial and cultural identity in the modern world, I find this trope about female agency to be limiting and just plain embarrassing. Boyden did a much better job of writing a compelling portrayal of the aging bush pilot, and the erosion of his old way of life into one marred by isolation and alcoholism. Where Annie and her female companions were effectively cardboard cut-outs of young females, Boyden gave real heart to this character, which somewhat saved the book. Somewhat. My other criticism of this book is that it is ultimately a snoozefest. Devices such as Annie's extended (seemingly interminable) sojourn in New York did nothing to further the plot. This is not to say that I will not be reading Boyden's third book, Three Day Road. The Orenda was enough to convince me that Boyden is a talented writer that writes about important Canadian issues. Maybe he should just stick to writing about men, though. ...more In Joseph Boyden\u2019s mesmerizing and beautifully-rendered second novel \u2013 a follow-up to Three Day Road\u2014former bush pilot Will Bird reflects, \u201cSomething\u2019s there, through the black spruce, just on the other side.

While I very much liked this book, it wasn't spectacular in my eyes - hence my rating. I very much enjoyed it, but I guess I was just hoping for more from it. I did get a great story, though, and a very good insight into the setting of Canada, and for that alone I would definitely recommend the book. ...more History is front and centre of Joseph Boyden's second novel, \"Through Black Spruce\".

Will and Annie Bird, the two narrative voices, are the son and granddaughter of Xavier Bird, one of the three central characters in the earlier book. Distinct in their approaches to their individual story, told in alternating chapters, they are also intricately connected. As the two \"confessions\" to each other unfold, they increasingly interweave into one multi-layered tapestry. Will, an experienced trapper and bush pilot, lies in a coma in the hospital of Moosonee, a James Bay community in northern Ontario. Very soon we realize that only one of two possible events can have landed him in this state: another crash with his small bush plane or another big fight with Marius, the bully and controlling local drug lord and prominent member of the Netmaker family. The Birds and the Netmaker families have more than one reasons to be enemies and, recently, much had to do with Will's other niece, the stunningly beautiful Suzanne, who took off with Marius' brother; both have disappeared without a trace since. Annie, recently returned from several months down south, sits by her uncle's side and, speaking softly to his ear, hopes to somehow connect with him and to bring him back to the waking world. While in his deep sleep, Will's mind is in a state of active dreaming, looking back on his life. Following the twisting and winding ways of memory lane, he digs deep into his past, reviewing and reassessing his hopes and failures, his loves and losses and, eventually the moments of happiness and peace. A sense of urgency compels him to share his life's story and all its secrets with his two beloved nieces. Unbeknownst to Annie, of course, who has her own reasons to reflect on recent experiences. After some reluctance to talk to a comatose, Annie in turn describes to her uncle the events of the last months that took her to Toronto, Montreal and to New York City and, eventually, brought her back to Moosonee. Whereas Will is intimately connected to the 'old ways' and the constant struggle between traditional and modern worlds in this remote part of the Canadian landscape, Annie lives with between the two realities. Tempted by an invitation, she gave in to the powerful lure of the southern world of the big cities, the excitements and opportunities that they hold for the enterprising young. Annie has another important reason to head south. She is following the trail of her missing sister, who, according to rumours, had made it big in the world of fashion modeling. In Toronto, Annie comes across a group of urban 'Indians' who provide her with the first clues as to Suzanne's whereabouts. Following Annie, Gordon, AKA Painted Tongue, is sent by the group's elder on a mission of his own. Through Annie's eyes and experiences we are introduced into both the desolate life of urban 'Indians' living at the margins of society as well as the glamour of fashion models and their handlers, especially in New York City. Still, Annie is increasingly torn between her old and new life. Boyden very skilfully evokes and contrasts the two worlds while not shying away from exposing the shallowness of glamour, the brutality of drug trafficking, the dependency on alcohol or drugs and the human frailties that are found in both societies, in each with different parameters and consequences. The novel's present is set in the northern Ontario countryside and most of the characters are, fundamentally, grounded in this stunningly beautiful, untouched land, amongst its rivers and lakes, its flora and fauna. Will uses the black spruce as a recurrent theme for the power of the forest that demands respect and admiration - an almost mystical, living element in the mind of the lonely hunter. The strong restorative power of this landscape for those who are open to its natural splendour is empathetically portrayed. Both Will and Annie are deeply drawn to it. One of the most emotionally engaging passages describes Will's survival on Akimiski Island, the largest island in James Bay. Richly drawn scenes of him coming upon a whale skeleton on the beach or watching a polar bear fall through the ceiling of his little hut, bring out the physical challenges and the even deeper emotional ones. These and other scenes, equally beautifully conveyed in Boyden's expressive prose, turn into a realization of pivotal importance in Will's existence and they may bring him hope to reconnect with the present reality. Boyden's love for the natural beauty of this landscape, his intimate knowledge of the traditional ways of the Cree speak out of every sentence.While showing much empathy and compassion for his charactes, his portrayals are realistic and reflect their complexities. In addition to Will and Annie, who stand out as the most richly developed and engaging personalities, there are others, friends and family, loves of past and present, and while less developed they are nevertheless intriguing and their interactions with the two narrators compelling. There is much dramatic flow and tension in the story, most sections are real page-turners. Overall, this is a well-paced novel that is hard to put down. Some commentators have expressed disappointment with the novel's ending. While I agree to some degree, the conclusion is one of only a few possible and consistent ones. For me, it is without doubt one of the most engaging and beautifully written novels I have read in quite a long time. ...more This is like Marilynne Robinson lite: I recognized the combination of polish on trauma, the finely honed suffering.

Oh, and don't expect any joy or playfulness, even in the language. Everything is permanently set at a droning bore of dead serious 11. I think one of the things that make me skeptical about this type of writing is how easy it is, finally, to read: your one big enemy is boredom rather than horror. It may be nominally about violence, about hurt, about the aforementioned suffering, but it's not actually that hard to take. I think this suffers, too, from a comparison with A Brief History of Seven Killings , which I am also currently reading. That book is genuinely harrowing (Nina with the belt in her hand, buckle out, goddamn). Given the content here, shouldn't I be a little less inclined to nod off? Apparently I am not the only one in my book club who was not a fan. Martine is of the opinion that while this is certainly a book, it may not really qualify as literature, or art. That seems about right. I would add that the renewed trend toward thinking that novels should be morally edifying is perhaps the worst thing to happen to fiction since the last time novels were supposed to be morally edifying. ...more This is one of those books I would probably never have picked up were it not this month's selection of my bookclub, despite the fact that I have another of Boyden's books on my shelf, (Three Day Road), which I have not read yet.

I read other reviews in this forum before writing this one and the platitudes for this book are glowing. And yet we need to ask the tough questions, despite people\u2019s origins and sensibilities, if we are to mine gems from amidst the oceans of literary flotsam out today. What follows is therefore one reader\u2019s opinion, mine, and many may not agree with me. First off, I was underwhelmed by the pace of this novel, slow moving and circular, lacking in narrative thrust until about page 150 when the bear is shot; and you\u2019ll have to wait much longer until the protagonists finally make love with their respective partners. I wondered why the story of Annie, the fashion model, was woven into the one of Will, the bush pilot. Will\u2019s story is good in itself and is the one that interests me the most for it has echoes of Three Day Road, the book that first enamoured me to Boyden. Was Annie introduced to draw female readers, and was she taken to New York to include that larger southern market? A girl from the bush who traps animals for a living suddenly hitting the high spots of the fashion world in the Big Apple seems a bit far- fetched to me. Will\u2019s and Annie\u2019s could not be two more disparate story lines trying hard to meet, just like the two of them struggling to communicate with each other in the hospital. The coma-ridden uncle, Will, and the niece returned from her adventures abroad, Annie, are only able to talk to each other through the voices inside their heads, an interesting device; and there are many such examples of unarticulated voices: Gordon (the mute protector) of Annie, Suzanne (the missing sister) of Annie, and Soleil (the fashionista godmother) of Annie. The use of the vernacular to emulate the voices of Will and Annie, who narrate their alternating chapters in first person, masks the elegance of language I know Boyden is capable of. Once, I found the word \u201cthem\u201d used seven times in three consecutive short paragraphs! On the credit side, I found the sections of Will fighting his addiction, flying and crashing his plane several times, enduring the hurts of unkind humans, showing kindness to wild animals, suffering the guilt for losing his family, and living off the land in hostile weather to be revealing and inspirational. The mute Gordon also emerges as a strong character, a kind of Chief Broom from One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. As a tale for showing that the back-to-the-land life in the bush, despite its hardships, works better than the artificial high-life of big cities, this novel hits the mark. The New York (and Montreal) scenes are also amateurishly delivered to drive the point home; Soleil\u2019s \u201cpussy posse\u201d comes across as a bunch of cardboard cut-outs. But then so does the brain-dead and inept Marius, who tries several times to bump off Will and Co. Will Bird remains the one redeeming force in the novel that kept me reading until the end, and I hope he returns, alone, for a repeat engagement in a future novel. ...more Powerful, well written, and a wonderful story. I think it helps having read Three Day Road first, for the back story and the understanding of Boyden's storytelling style. Had a hard time putting both books down; the stories flowed so well. \"Moosonee. End of the road. End of the tracks,\" declares Will Bird, a Cree bush pilot lying broken in a hospital bed in this end of the tracks village in northern Ontario.

End of the tracks,\" declares Will Bird, a Cree bush pilot lying broken in a hospital bed in this end of the tracks village in northern Ontario. He weaves his story silently, his voice imprisoned by his comatose state. Moosonee is remote, rugged, its Cree Nation inhabitants largely self-sufficient; it is also vulnerable. Poverty fuels drug and alcohol addiction. Those who do leave the community for the excitement and economic opportunity of Toronto or Montreal often fall prey to the cities' darker sides. This is a world of deep and disturbing contrasts. The great beauty of Ontario's bush, the tightly-knit community that watches over its own, the commitment to holding on to an independent life are set against the violence of survival, the turning away from First Nations' traditions and the glamour and degradation of shining and sinister cities. Will is the son of Xavier Bird, the WWI sharpshooter whose story was told in the extraordinary Three Day Road . Although it is not necessary to have read Three Day Road to be fully engaged in Through Black Spruce , it provides considerable context as Will reflects on his past and considers his motivations. It also gives a broader historical perspective on Will's tribe and the experience First Nations' people in the region. Will takes us back through his recent history, explaining in tones that are unsentimental but often contrite, rueful, self-effacing and hilarious, how he came to this hospital bed. His story is the heart and soul of this novel. His sweet honesty charms, whether it is the stumbling jogs he takes along a dirt road, trying to shuffle off his mid-life beer belly, the ill-advised shine he takes to a blind and deaf \"dump\" bear, his halting romance with a childhood friend, or his multiple attempts to quit drinking. Most tender is his great love for his nieces, Annie and Suzanne. Suzanne has vanished. Her beauty and wild spirit launches her into a lucrative modeling career, but somewhere along the way she mixed in with the unscrupulous. Her missteps lead directly to the hospital where her uncle now lies, unresponsive and shrinking. Annie, her less-lovely but fiercer sister, undertakes an Odyssean journey to the great cities of the south to find her. Annie's story is intertwined with Will's. Both narratives are rich with themes of grievous errors, the search for redemption, the struggle to balance old ways with new pressures, and the reluctance to believe they are worthy of love. I struggled, however, to connect with Annie's experiences as she shimmers on the edges of the model-and-club scenes in Toronto, Montreal and New York City. She is too easily seduced by the glamour, the drugs, the money. Instead of finding her sister, Annie becomes her. The scenes border on the melodramatic as the world outside of Moosonee, particularly the United States, is portrayed as unrelentingly corrupt and dangerous. Annie is trailed through each city by a homeless, internet-savvy mute Indian, Gordon, whose chiseled torso and ropy muscles save Annie at every turn. Annie is able to return the favor as the two return north to the protection of the clan and Annie becomes teacher-guide to Gordon. Although his presence is odd, Gordon embodies a vision of the modern Indian returning to his cultural roots, to learn and embrace the old ways as he cleanses his soul of the corrupt contemporary world. He is a far more intriguing character than Annie's other new pals: models and it-crowd sycophants - who are ciphers that add little to Annie's development or to the plot thread of Suzanne's disappearance. But Boyden's skill as a storyteller propels the reader through these incongruous passages. The constantly-shifting narrative maintains a taut pace. The events -whether jolting or endearing - are unexpected and drive you to turn each page. The central characters are brought to life with vivid description and fine dialogue. You ache for their salvation. This is an immensely satisfying read by a supremely gifted writer. ...more I've had this book on my shelf for - oh about a year and a half. I knew it was good...

Well - thank goodness for CBC book club on Goodreads! It became one of the first of the group's reads and now I had no excuse not to finally pick it up and enjoy what I knew would be a good book. And it got me to wondering..... why did I wait to read this? What made me pass it by to pick up other (far less memorable, I might add) books? How long did it actually sit by my bedside table waiting? I can't believe it took so long to dust it off and read it. It was a really wonderful story. Something in it really resonated with me - perhaps it's how the characters spent so much time searching and losing their way from things that were important to them, only to find them right where they started. Or perhaps it was the way they had such misguided ideas on how to right wrongs, only to find that things always sort themselves out in the end. Or it may have been the deep intrinsic love of a family that keeps such tight invisible bonds on you, keeping you bouyed up when you feel like you're sinking - even when you deny it - that struck such a deep chord. Don't know really, can't put my finger on the exact thing of the story that hit so close to home. But it did, and me, I'm ever so glad I read it! A wonderfully woven story that starts with two different voices talking - personally to you, as if you were the other person. It's like the two strings of a swing that spin together, at first slowly then getting tighter and tighter until the point where it has to unravel, the two sides come together and you understand how it all comes together. First, they're two different stories, then you realize they're somehow related until you realize it's all one and the same. It's two members of a family that feel the need to solve a problem in paradoxically different ways, pushing the limits on themselves that nearly kill them and returning back to center. It's a story of family and love, and the wisdom to know that, ulimately, that's what counts in the end. It's also a story of the Canadian Native life and how it has changed -not always for the best - but how it is something to hold to, even with the changes. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up and give it your time. You won't be disappointed. ...more This is the third Joseph Boyden book I've read before and, as always, I really enjoyed his writing.

I also really liked how this evolved a bit like a mystery novel- and that you learn more and piece more things together as you read. The writing, pacing and the plot definitely make this an enjoyable novel to read. I have to admit I did not enjoy Annie's narrative quite as much as Will's. I wasn't a fan of the integration of the fashion world in the story, it didn't ring true to me. I found the lessons learned in this aspects of Annie's story were pretty cliched and I expected more from her story line. I did enjoy the introduction of Gordon's character, however. Overall this book was good, but weaker, in my opinion, than The Orenda. It may be an unfair comparison due to the completely different settings and historical periods, but I can't help but compare them as novels. I am looking forward to reading Three Day Road. ...more This is the best book I've read all year!! This book is a deserving winner of the prestigious Giller prize in 2008.

Both Will and his young niece Annie have terrible stories to tell and each heals through the sharing of them. I highly recommend this book, but I would suggest that you read Three Day Road first. You will feel richer from the experience of enjoying superlative story telling. Both books will take you up and out of your everyday life and into a magical world that seems so very real while you are there reading about it. ...more 3 stars - It was good.

Family loyalty and kinship is thick as is the use of alcohol. The main character is implicated in the attempted murder of a man that has been stalking him. His nieces take off for N.Y.C. to earn money as models and find their own trouble there. Really a good read! One I would recommend! God I loved this book. I didn't realize it was a sort of sequel to Three Day Road featuring children and grandchildren of those characters. It can certainly be read as a standalone but it was nice to occasionally touch these characters memories of Xavier Bird. Wonderful writing and beautifully honest characters. THROUGH BLACK SPRUCE isn't the first book it's taken me quite a long time to read, it's not even the one that took the longest to read, but it did take many attempts before I was able to get any traction. This attempt I read the blurb first-up and did a little Google hunting - something I normally try not to do. But this time I really needed it to find out what on earth was going on. Then it dawned on me why I was having so much trouble getting into the book. THROUGH BLACK SPRUCE is a family stor THROUGH BLACK SPRUCE isn't the first book it's taken me quite a long time to read, it's not even the one that took the longest to read, but it did take many attempts before I was able to get any traction. This attempt I read the blurb first-up and did a little Google hunting - something I normally try not to do. But this time I really needed it to find out what on earth was going on. Then it dawned on me why I was having so much trouble getting into the book. THROUGH BLACK SPRUCE is a family story, told from two main points of view. Annie is the sister of the missing Suzanne, as per the blurb. She's the one who did come home, after a whirlwind time in the big cities which started off with her looking for Suzanne and ended up with her almost living Suzanne's life. The other main narrator is their Uncle Will, a man haunted by loss, old, looking back at his life and the disastrous outcomes surrounding the disappearance of Suzanne. The book launches into these individual voices very quickly, and there's no real hint at the start as to what the story is about, and where the reader is being taken. It's a controlled, contained, almost placid book to start off with, beautifully evocative of life in a harsh and difficult environment and the joys and tensions of living in a small community. It draws a series of wonderful, thoughtful, sometimes eccentric, often quite poignant characterisations. At no stage does THROUGH THE BLACK SPRUCE give anything unnecessary away. And that is why the book may have been so difficult to get any traction on. There is no indication at the start where this is going, even for a while who is narrating; what has happened; how anybody got to the position they are in, or even what exact position that is; where the story is leading. This is immersion reading, and in a way extreme faith reading. The reader has to simply give in to the author, allow this world and these people to slowly, very very slowly emerge, draw their pictures, cohere into a tale of violence and extremes, kindness, love and compassion. Once you do give in, allow this book to work it's way into it's own story and draw you into the world, it's often rather beautiful. Uncle Will is a marvellous old character, wise and stupid, kind, stubborn and game as. Annie is very much a survivor, whether that's in the modelling studios and parties of New York and Toronto or deep in the frozen forest in the hunting camps, setting traps and coaxing the old snowmobile into one more trip, she's strong and very very like her Uncle. THROUGH BLACK SPRUCE is not however, a perfect book. It's strengths are most definitely in Will's world, as he narrates his life, as he moves through the Canadian wilderness, as he goes backwards and forwards through his past and his present. Less convincing are the times that Annie spends away from forest, in the cities and the modelling life. This is more sketchy, flat and bland, hard to follow, less immersing. Because of that there's frequently a lack of balance in the narration. Will became a real focus, allowing the reader to understand and accept his connection to his home, the land and the creatures around him. There was less of that connection with Annie - maybe because of the Indian spiritualism which worked well for Will but didn't seem to have such authenticity in her city based world. Once she's back in the forest, at her Uncle's side, and once the events surrounding the disappearance of Suzanne start to clarify, Annie starts to make more sense. But it was hard to shake a slight suspicion of contrivance. But that's a minor quibble. Ultimately I really liked this book, once I'd figured out how to read it. It's probably not a book for a more traditional crime fiction fan - it's definitely about the journey and not the destination, but once into it, once I'd figured out who was who and that I wasn't supposed to have the slightest idea what was going on for most of the book, I just went with it. And along the way there were some glorious moments. ...more Book Review: Through Black Spruce Viking Canada 2008 Giller Book Prize Winner ISBN 978-0-670-06363-5 I love Joseph Boyden\u2019s stories.

Through Black Spruce is a triumph well deserving of the Giller prize recently awarded to him. Some of the main characters in this book\u2019s group of Cree people living in and around James Bay are descended from the main character, Xavier Bird - the main character from Boyden\u2019s previous work, Three Day Road. A good part of this story concerns Will Bird, grandson of Xavier Bird. A bush pilot, retired after a long career and three plane crashes, Will Bird hunts, fishes and drinks. He is alone in the world after a tragedy takes his family. He still has his bush-plane and uses it from time to time. Xavier Bird, Will\u2019s grandfather, appears in the story by proxy, through the presence of a 303 sniper rifle Xavier used in WW I in the trenches of France then bequeathed to his grandson. Will Bird believes the rifle speaks to him sometimes. In another story-line, young attractive Cree in Toronto, Montreal and New York make good money as fashion models. Apparently, the native look is in. We learn, however, all roads lead home to James Bay except for certain lost souls. \u201cNow at this moment, I wish there was something in this world called fairness, I used to think there was, a long time ago.\u201d Will Bird laments in one scene late in the story when we are not sure he will survive. This quote has wider meaning, however, with respect to native people and their place in the modern world. This story\u2019s theme is again that of native people struggling with life\u2019s enormous obstacles multiplied by their history, and the difficult task existing in the world of the white man without losing their traditional identity. The reality and prevalence of alcoholism, substance abuse, and violence in the native community is truly tragic and is not glossed over in this story. Yet, at the same time the story reminds us that the majority of native people are resourceful, intelligent, and generous souls. The dialogue in Boyden\u2019s writing is terrific, as is his pacing and use of breaks. His descriptive powers are substantial as is his knowledge of the Cree nature lore. We feel we are truly present with characters in the wilderness scenes and we learn much along the way regarding traditional native skills of hunting, trapping, and fishing. The characters are likeable, funny at points, and each of them cognizant and respectful of their Cree heritage if at times cynical. Most of them make generous and at times heroic gestures toward one another, their nature being more collective and kind, rather than staunchly individual and selfish. Their connection to the natural world is evident. The characters are three dimensionally complex although there is one character, one dimensionally evil, serving as an important foil in the plot. Most stories need at least one of these I guess. Boyden uses a structure that follows several connected story lines that converge. This involves a lot of flashbacks and shifts of point of view that at times I found confusing. This was only a minor annoyance in an otherwise wonderful story. Through Black Spruce is rumoured to be the second part of a trilogy. I could see another book continuing the story as certain characters and stories remain unresolved. I give Through Black Spruce four stars out of five and congratulate Boyden on a well deserved Giller Prize win. He is a wonderful writer and we can expect many more great books from him.

You just wish that there could have been a happier beginning and continuation for his family. Of course it isn't all bad - there's a ton of strength and dignity and resilience and power there too. I am always so impressed by Boyden's use of Anishinaabe and Cree, and the way he coveys tone and accent in people's English. I am also impressed by his unvarnished unapologetic depiction of Will's alcoholism. This man's weakness is very clear. But so is his strength and his tragedy and some real deep friendships that he has, all of which ring true. The less successful part of the book is Annie's search for her lost sister and her foray into the life of a fashion model in Toronto and New York. They felt a little shallow and the plot wasn't as as strong. Her character is still interesting though - she is the heiress of her great-great-aunt Niska's gifts of healing and visions, as well as her independent streak. I also really enjoyed the parts where Annie and Will (at different times) are trapping, hunting, living off the land in a modern day context. They aren't re-enactments of \"dead Indians\" (as Tom King calls our stereotypical idea of Indians in his nonficiton) but rather \"live Indians\" - doing things with agency right now. While it didn't touch me as much as Three Day Road, this book is a wonderful contemporary family story. ...more The energy of Boyden's writing is incredible.
