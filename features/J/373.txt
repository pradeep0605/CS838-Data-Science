I know, this has been said many times before but I have to repeat it. This was epic! <+++>The Iron Queen</+++> picks up right after Meghan and Ash were exiled and tells the story about Meghan\u2019s last fight against the False Iron King and her attempt to save the Nevernever. This was an epic story about bravery, loyalty, friendship, true love as well as despair, loss and sacrifices. All my beloved characters were back in this book. Grim was his usual mysterious self, providing \u201cI am a cat\u201d as an explanation for almost everything, and Puck was still the funny and loyal, though a little more bitter, best friend that I\u2019ve grown to love. Then there were some new characters that added to the fun like Glitch and Razor. I fell in love with Razor right away. I want my very own little Gremlin! And, of course, there were Meghan and Ash. I adored Meghan in this third installment of the Iron Fey series. She\u2019s grown up, she\u2019s brave and loyal and displays the possession of some serious guts. But the best character of this entire series is Ash. He really gets to shine in this book. I enjoyed seeing his icy facade melt and getting a glimpse at the amazing person that lies behind it. Both Ash and Puck made my eyes well up several times with their declarations of love and dedication to Meghan. There has rarely been a book that managed to suck me into the story as thoroughly as the books of the Iron Fey series did. You know how sometimes your thoughts drift off while reading? It doesn\u2019t mean that the book is bad, it just happens? Well, this was definitely not the case here. I love Kagawa\u2019s worldbuilding and the dark and brooding atmosphere her writing style creates. It\u2019s like a mixture of Alice in Wonderland, Matrix and The Lord of the Rings and made me forget everything around me. Her writing was so vivid, I saw the world unfold before my inner eye like I was watching a movie. Truly amazing. As for the romance...I have mentioned before that I\u2019m not a big fan of that instant-love-at-first-sight-thing. It rarely works for me. Where it did work, for example, was Twilight. Yes, I am one of those people. Don\u2019t hit me, please. And after having finished the Iron Queen I can say, here it worked again. Ash is just...he\u2019s so...I am at loss for words. Nothing I can say would do him justice but let me tell you this: He nudged Edward off his throne. That\u2019s how much I adore this character. As for the ending? Oh.My.Freaking.God. To say that I cried like a baby would put it mildly. I\u2019m talking heart wrenching, all-consuming sobs here. And now I am desperate, yes desperate to read the Iron Knight. Oh God... Last but not least, thanks to Harlequin Enterprises for the opportunity to read this book now, instead of having to wait until February 2011. Thanks so much! ------------------------------------------------------------ I know, this is getting old but I have to mention this. I LOVE these two quotes. They made me fall in love with Ash all over again: \u201cHey,\u201d I whispered, as Ash slipped his arms around my waist from behind, drawing me close. I could feel his glare aimed at Puck over my head, a silent, protective gesture that spoke louder than any words. \u201cMine. Back off.\" \u201cOne more thing\u201d Ash said in his dangerous, soft voice as we turned away. \u201cIf you do not return with her\u201d Ash continued staring him down, \u201cI will turn this entire camp into a bloodbath. That is my promise.\u201d ---------------------------------------------------------- Songs I listened to while reading: \u201cOn the nature of daylight\u201d by Max Richter \u201cAll that is good\u201d by Tyler Bates \u201cEvenstar\u201d - Lord of the Rings sound track \u201cViolin Concerto II\u201d by Philip Glass Stef and Morgan, thanks for providing the right soundtrack for this book. It made the reading experience so much more intense. While I was reading the final chapters I listended to \u201con the nature of daylight\u201d by Max Richter and it made my heart shatter into a million tiny pieces. Kim, I really enjoyed our reading date. Thanks, hun. ^^ Alright, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m locking myself up in a closet now and I won\u2019t come out before a certain dark faery knight shows up and offers to take me away. ...more Ah, I\u2019ve finally come to the end of this series (<---B>sort of</---B>). It\u2019s quite clear to me that I really am not a fan of <---A>Julie Kagawa</---A>\u2019s writing style but I\u2019m always hopeful. Sadly, I have resigned myself to believing that this is not going to change, not now and not ever. There was nothing really offensive to me in this book as they were in the previous ones. The story moved at a decent enough clip, I suppose, though I find myself having to force myself to finish it because her prose is just so dry and bo Ah, I\u2019ve finally come to the end of this series (sort of). It\u2019s quite clear to me that I really am not a fan of Julie Kagawa\u2019s writing style but I\u2019m always hopeful. Sadly, I have resigned myself to believing that this is not going to change, not now and not ever. There was nothing really offensive to me in this book as they were in the previous ones. The story moved at a decent enough clip, I suppose, though I find myself having to force myself to finish it because her prose is just so dry and boring. Her writing is very rough and stilted, lacking any finesse or subtlety. The dialogue was particularly cringe worthy at times, being either too sappy or too clich\u00e9. Even the witty lines of banter traded between Puck, Ash, and Meghan gave me a moment of pause because my only thought was \u201cwhere have I heard this before?\u201d I have finally realized why I dislike Ash so much. He reads like a fangirl\u2019s wet panty fantasy of Sephiroth, only in faerie disguise and in a different book. I mean, really, how can you not see the similarities? He\u2019s cold and distant, got lots of nice, long, glossy hair, wields a sword with skills like no one\u2019s business, and well, supposedly, he\u2019s hot beyond the extremes! Case in point: Does that look a wee bit familiar? No, well then I have a good explanation for this! It\u2019s no wonder Ash constantly a giant ice cube rammed up his ass if his true name is Ashallyn\u2019darkmyr Tallyn. What kind of sissy name is that?! I would forealz be a stuck-up bitch loser if I had some shitz0r name like that. Ahahaha. Thank freaking goodness Meghan decided to cut the water works in this series. If I had to hear about how much her tears spilled out of her eyes or whatever nonsense like that I think I\u2019d take Ash\u2019s own sword and stab her through the gut. Now she\u2019ll really have something to cry about, the loser. At least this time in this book she doesn\u2019t stand around like a loser. She actually gets involved in things. Haha! Too bad the sex scene you guys were waiting for was nothing more than a super short paragraph and a very vague fade to black. No hot fantasies here. (Not that I would ever have one with him, eew.) And, omg, there was one point in the book I wanted to facepalm so hard. Okay, so Meghan finds this cellphone and it has a Hello Kitty sticker on it with and I quote \u201cJapanese kanji\u201d. WHO ARE THE FACT CHECKERS HERE?! Kanji is already Japanese, so therefore the need to call it Japanese is redundant! If that was the case why didn\u2019t she just call it Japanese characters?! HELLO? Does anyone get super annoyed by these simple errors like me? I mean it could have been fixed in two seconds if someone just googled up kanji. Bleh! Spoiler here, I\u2019d suggest skipping if you don\u2019t want to know. The ending was mildly interesting in that there was a lot of action and that final showdown everyone was looking forward too. I found it quite disappointing that the guy was killed off so easy. Like, wut? I just gotta tap into my super uber SPECIAL power I didn\u2019t know I had and OMG, HE DIES? No. Just no. I was about to scream HELLZ YEAH, when Meghan was dying because I could not stand anymore of her pathetic, emo-riffic thoughts. And then I was all HOORAY, THANK THE WRITING GODS that her and Ash are now PERMANENTLY split up. I could not stand anymore of their mushy mushy, let\u2019s kiss kiss times ANYMORE. Freaking sap ass fairy. Ima teach him how a REAL bad ass fairy is supposed to look like. Oh, hellz yeah. Sephiroth would beat the shit out of him (Ash) with his HAIR. Hah. But anyway, the ending while actually resolved makes me mad because obviously it\u2019s open ended and now there\u2019s gonna be another book from ASH\u2019S POINT OF VIEW! Watch I bet it\u2019s all gonna be about omg, Puck that evil bastard killed my ex-girlfriend, then omg, Meghan I love and misses you so much and we needs to have more hot loving time, but NO YOU REJECTED ME. PAH! You give fairies\u2026 a bad name. (Yes, totally intentional) XD. Update: Since I was quoted in Julie Kagawa's post: http://juliekagawa.blogspot.com/2012/01/authors-and-negative-reviews-re-posted.html , I guess I'll have to add on to this. I didn't say her name \"Julie Kagawa, you give fairies a bad name\" as is stated in my review. I'll make it clear that I was listening to this song while writing to the review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZHPO... which is where the line came from. I believe I was referring to Ash giving fairies a bad name, not her. Besides if you listen to this song, I think it sums up Ash and Meghan's relationship quite well. And, seriously? This review is just a critique of her story and if I someday get published I would not give a shit if someone wrote negative reviews. The snarkier, or blunt, or straight to the point the better. As for not saying this to someone's face in person I sure as fuck would. I express myself freely and how I want so they get to do the same too. ...more 2.5 This is way better than the previous installment, but since some chapters, though not too many, just three or four, were so boring as to practically compel me to skim through more than actually read them, I can't honestly bring myself to rate this 3 stars. \u201cI wished that, for once, faery tales \u2013real faery tales, not Disney fairy tales\u2013 would have a happy ending.\u201d I wished that too, but Meghan didn't die, so, adios happy ending. There'll be other occasions. Okay, I'm usually not this harsh toward 2.5 This is way better than the previous installment, but since some chapters, though not too many, just three or four, were so boring as to practically compel me to skim through more than actually read them, I can't honestly bring myself to rate this 3 stars. \u201cI wished that, for once, faery tales \u2013real faery tales, not Disney fairy tales\u2013 would have a happy ending.\u201d I wished that too, but Meghan didn't die, so, adios happy ending. There'll be other occasions. Okay, I'm usually not this harsh towards fictional characters, and I don't like to be, so I've made up my mind: I won't bully Meghan in this review . Also because I've abudantly vented my fury and indignation in my reviews of both The Iron King and The Iron Daughter . Only, allow me to say two things: firstly, that once again she proved her extreme and stubborn childishness when she accused Puck of, basically, (view spoiler) [having saved her father's life (hide spoiler) ] and thus began holding a grudge against him. Had it been Ash, she would have forgiven him in the blink of an eye. And as a matter of fact, I strongly believe that this book was written with the sole purpose of making us grasp once and for all that if you're not Ash, you are not worth a dime. I beg to differ. In the second place, if you sleep with dogs (or in this case, just one dog... stop being mean, Simona!) you'll wake up with fleas, because it seems to me that the more time Ash spends with Meghan, the more hysterical and teenager-ish he turns. He and Meghan keep fighting, or sort of, seeing how they make up -and then make out- a couple of pages later, because she tells him she can take care of herself, and he goes mad for this. You get it? She tries to stand for her independence, and he's kind of offended by this because he's supposed to be her knight. Then, he goes all icy out of spite, just like a four-year old would. The only definition I find for this behavior is shamefully immature . Why did Kagawa have to ruin even him? Yeah, I thought that too. Definitely too much useless and perfectly avoidable drama here. But, what a twist, I've also something positive to say: I liked the ending very much. The last forty, or maybe thirty pages were actually nice to read and more enjoyable that the rest of the book. I'll surely read the next installment eagerly, not only because of this ending but also because it's told from Ash's perspective, and we all know what that means: no more Meghan's thoughts around to kill my surviving neurons. That's blessing, that's what it is. I have a question concerning the plot though, and I'm wondering if, having just flipped through thos three or four chapters, I may have lost some information, or if maybe it is just a plot hole and that's it. Now, not that I don't trust Kagawa, but I don't really trust Kagawa, so excuse me if I'm prone to believing the latter. The question is: (view spoiler) [if the Iron King's powers can be passed on only when a king dies, then how could Machina ever obtain them if Ferrum was still alive? (hide spoiler) ] I'd be really glad to anyone who would enlighten me, because if truly no explanation of this is given, well, that's a pretty huge oversight to me.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Final rating: 4/5 stars So... how the hell do i start this review????

Besides the characters, the story itself was also completely encompassing. Within the first few pages, I was swept up, into this stunning world that Julie has created and I didn't want to leave. Julie's writing is so easy to read, and her imagery, the creatures in this world.... everything is just so very imaginative. I'm pleasantly surprised every time I read one of her novels. And the love story reaches it's pinnacle.... and can I just say.. WOW... and aw www .... and please, oh please, oh please! and the most important reaction: YOU'RE KILLING ME! I honestly can't say enough good things about these books... and I wish I was a little more eloquent, so that I could write a review worthy of it's awesomeness... but you'll have to settle with this dear readers.

So instead of just reviewing The Iron Queen, this will be an Iron Fey review. Got it? Ok, off we go! The Iron Fey series is about a girl named <---C>Meghan Chase</---C>. When we first meet her he day of her 16th birthday, she is a normal, quiet, teenage girl struggling to fit in at school. However, when her brother is kidnapped by the fey, she travels to the Nevernever to rescue him alongside her best friend, Robbie Goodfell, who is the legendary Puck or Robin Goodfellow (unbeknownst to her until then). Along the way, she meets a Cait Sith named Grimilkin and the Winter Prince, Ash. She also finds out she is a half fey and her father is non other than Lord Oberon, King of the Summer Court. Along the journey, they discover a new breed of fey called Iron Fey. They are growing in number and threaten to destroy the Nevernever as they know it. However, she never planned on falling in love with Ash and he her. It is forbidden for summer and winter to fall in love. I loved watching Ash and Megan's love grow for each other in this series. It was beautiful. I did think that in the Iron daughter, Meghan got a bit obsessive, reminding me of Bella swan, but it can be over looked because this series is just that amazing. The character growth is brilliantly written. By the end of the series Meghan is no longer a shy girl; she is tough and knows what she wants. And even though Ash vows to protect her, he realizes that she has changed and become strong. The banter between Puck and Ash was classic. And I swear no one can insult and compliment someone in the same sentence the way Grimilkin did. The battle/fight scenes were epic! Very descriptive. I felt like I too was fighting besides Ash, Puck and Meghan. The best part of the series was the ending. The last book. Seriously. If you pick up The Iron King and The Iron Daughter and are wondering what the hell I'm hyping this up for, READ THE LAST BOOK. It's one of the best books I have ever read. It was perfect. I think I cried for the entire ending. I felt the hope, desire, and love. I keep thinking there could have been another way Julie! But that is what I love about this series, it's realistic fiction. We don't always get what we want, no matter how hard we want it to be so. Living a fairy tale doesn't change that. And for that, I believe there was no other way to end this series with changing the book cannon. Hats off to you Julie Kagawa. That was truly remarkable. In the words of Meghan Chase, \"It was...quite a ride. Wasn't it?\" It sure was. I desperately look forward to The Iron Knight and any future works from Julie Kagawa's imagination.

P.E.R.F.E.C.T.I.O.N. in EPIC proportions! BRILLIANT! I read the netgalley of The Iron Queen before the book was released (thank you Netgalley and HarlequinTeen!)... it was so good I immediately had to reread the series up to and including The Iron Queen again. I am still blown away! Julie Kagawa is a master story teller. She has the ability to paint the scene with her words and describe the characters so richly, it's like a movie is playing in my head as I read. Julie masterfully orchestrated the perfect faerie story with a modern twist. It will touch on every raw emotion you have so be ready for a very emotional roller coaster ride. The Iron Queen starts off with a bang and keeps a full pace throughout. Meghan and Ash have been exiled to the mortal world. Meghan is, in her mind, planning her future in the mortal realm after some rather life-altering events that took place in the previous books. However, this book proves that those thoughts were futile from the very beginning. Meghan's destiny has other ideas. Meghan has to be my favourite heroine/protagonist EVER! She is tough yet vulnerable. Her character develops and matures in a believable and yet dramatic way. She's not perfect, and still tends to revert back to her 17 year old idiocies at times, but that grounds her, in my mind. But when the chips are down... she's got plenty of courage and determination to fulfill what she sets out to do. She sacrifices so much for the greater good... that's a huge part of her character and is so very integral to the story... it's all about sacrifice for those she loves. What I also adored about Meghan is that she is the sort of person who just brings out the best in everyone around her. You can't help but want to be her friend. I still have a real soft spot for Puck. He, of course, has to be where Meghan is... old habits die hard.... and so we find out that he has chosen to follow her into exile as well. Puck continues to be sharp witted, and there is a bit of a bitter edge to him now. It's a tough pill for him to swallow, seeing Meghan and Ash together... happy. My heart really goes out to him. And Ash... oh where do I begin?? Meghan has grown by leaps and bounds since the beginning of this series... but perhaps the most astonishing transformation is in Ash. The former prince of the Unseelie Court sheds several layers of his icey facade and displays what has been hiding behind his (beautiful) mask, and it reveals a wonderful hero. In The Iron Queen, we learn a lot about Ash's background, and why he puts up that blank mask -- for protection -- both for his heart and from the Winter Court. It's heart-warming that it is Meghan who touches his heart and brings out the real Ash. He hit all the right buttons for me. Ash was fiercely protective of Meghan, yet tough on her too... for example, when she asked Ash to teach her to fight. He was not gentle with her. He loved her enough to teach her to fight for real... with skill, instincts and cunning, which in turn, also boosted her confidence, and helped make her a stronger person all around. Ash is the epitome of the perfect \"knight in shining armour\"... literally. In my eyes, he is the perfect love interest, leading man, hero. There is nothing I don't love about him. Grimalkin is back... popping in and out as required...always in time to save their butts, along with his infamous retort when asked to explain himself, \"I am a cat\". We meet some \"friendly\" Iron Fey, too: Glitch, Razor (I LOOOOVE Razor!!), and some of Iron Horses's kin. All the characters, good and bad, come alive... no one is superfluous... each has a purpose, and are rich and dimensional. Each and every character pulls some sort of emotion out of you. Julie made me care so much for all of them. There is TONS of action sequences and surprises with just enough \"I knew it\" tidbits thrown in to make you clap to yourself! And with Meghan and Ash, there is NO shortage of romance. *sigh*... beautifully written and perfectly balanced. I will not give the ending away but I will say that it literally left me emotionally drained. This story sat with me for a very long time afterwards. That's how I know it was so good... it leaves an impression that doesn't easily fade away. And regarding the ending, THANK GOD I knew ahead of time that there will be a fourth book in this series, The Iron Knight!!! Knowing there will be more story got me through the ending of this one, even though the plot of this book had its conclusion. I tell you honestly... if you haven't started this series yet... YOU HAVE TO... RIGHT NOW!! This is EPIC... PHENOMENAL! Well done, Julie K! Well done! And I still say... if I could give it a hundred stars, I would! Note: Originally read: November 12-20, 2010. I have since read this book two more times and listened to the audio once. It still is my ultimate favourite TIF book but they are ALL sooooo good. This one just resonated with me the most and it still does! ADORE it even more each time I visit! ...more Beware of spoilers!

I feel like such a moron because organization just seems like an alien concept to me right now. I just want to fangirl hard. Regardless, I need to get my feelings out for this incredible piece of epic awesomeness. Characters Holy Puck . How these amazing creatures made me heart melt into a melted pool of Godiva chocolate in this book. Meghan: In the first two books, Meghan was insecure, weak, stupid as hell, and confused in regards to almost everything. She annoyed me in TID so much when she was with Ash. Then she completely made me head-over-heels for her. She changed into a beautiful, determined, incredibly strong fighter who did things that were best for the people she loved. She accepted the fact that not all things can end happily. And that made my heart break. Meghan wanted to be someone, be with her family, go places, do things, and she had to give it all up for the sake of her friends and family. I have respect for such a heroine. Meghan was honest, unafraid, caring, loving, and she never let anything get in the way of her goals. She sacrificed nearly everything for the safety and wellness of a world she barely knew. All her other flaws: her obsession over Ash, her slightly stupid responses or actions towards situations, and her unawareness towards her best friend all seem like nothing. I don't care anymore because Meghan grew to become a fighter, a woman, and a queen. I love her. Props to Kagawa for crafting such a memorable character. Thank you. Ash: Oh, Ash. I thought I would dislike you for the whole series. Your icy-like-the-inside-of-my-freezer personality, your boring, quiet ways of interacting with people, etc made me want to hate you. Then this book comes along and I like you. You won my heart. You changed my views on you. In the first two books, Prince Ash is the emotionless, calculating, callous son of Queen Mab, the emotionless, calculating, callous queen of Winter fey. However, he falls deeply in love with Meghan and a side of him is revealed. When he's around Meghan, he's different. It's cliche, but it's sweet. I must admit. In this book, he completely won my heart when he becomes Meghan's knight. What he said while he was on his knees with his head bowed made me want to read that paragraph at least five times because it was so darn romantic. *sighs* He opened up to Meghan in this book. He became more friendly and sweet. Their romance developed so beautifully, and I loved that. I believed that Ash and Meghan didn't fit, but after reading this book, I am sticking with them. They are meant to be. I was just really angry because Meghan annoyed the crap out of me and Ash was just... Ash. Now I love them together because they are perfect for each other. And that makes me happy. Puck: I loved you from the very beginning, babe. You won my heart at that bus stop when I first met you. You made my heart skip. You made me jump up and down and do happy dances. You made me ponder. You made me smile. You made me laugh. And you complete me. Robin Goodfellow, the beast of mischief, wit, and Summer, lets us see a side of him that he never showed in the first two books. In the first two books, he is Puck. The Puck who is wild, careless, impulsive, witty, and confident. In this book, his love for Meghan grows more. And we see the passionate, hurting, lost Puck. Though it did shatter my heart to see him like that for Meghan, he did make me want to love him even more, if that's even possible. He lets go of Meghan and accepts the fact that only Ash can make her happy, romantically. He lets her go because of Ash, who lost Ariella because of Puck's actions. Ash deserved to be happy and Puck let his feud with him go to hell for the sake of his friendship with Meghan and Ash. I love Puck so much. And I almost cried when he cried for Meghan in the end. However, Puck is happy. That makes me happy. And I am dying to know what happens to him in The Iron Knight . I want to read about Puck more than I want to read about Ash, despite the fact the the book is written in Ash's perspective. Puck, you could not have Meghan. You still love her, I know that. You might think that no one will love you except Meghan. You should know that alt=\"description\"/> So And it's all good, Goodfellow. Grimalkin: I want to honor him by naming my cat Grimalkin. I love Grim so much. His discreet personality, his sly, cunning attitude, his insulting mannerism towards Meghan amazed me. He is fond of Meghan, but shows it in the most bizarre ways. \"I am a cat.\" Yes, you are. And a beastly one at that. This series was a hell of a ride. I recommend this to everyone! I do understand the first two books are a bit cliche and dragging, BUT BUT BUT! This book will reward you with its epicness! It's incredible. It will change you. I'm telling you. Siriusly. I am done. *sighs* I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. Oh, I will.

THAT ENDING! I am dead, seriously cannot cope 3 *Review to come* The Iron Queen is one of the best fantasy books I've had the pleasure to read. Julie Kagawa took me on a journey that I can only describe as fantastical. The characters are incredibly realistic; vivid and rich with depth and passion. The world she creates is described so minutely that you can visualize yourself with Meghan right down to the acrid smell of iron. The emotions the story evokes run the gamut. This is one powerful story that deserves the highest praise. Ash and Meghan have been exile The Iron Queen is one of the best fantasy books I've had the pleasure to read. Julie Kagawa took me on a journey that I can only describe as fantastical. The characters are incredibly realistic; vivid and rich with depth and passion. The world she creates is described so minutely that you can visualize yourself with Meghan right down to the acrid smell of iron. The emotions the story evokes run the gamut. This is one powerful story that deserves the highest praise. Ash and Meghan have been exiled from NeverNever and all portals leading to Faery have been sealed off to them. Meghan and Ash are travelling to Louisiana, back to her family when they are attacked by iron fey intent on delivering her to the false King. It's then that Meghan realizes she can't use her glamour without getting extremely weak and dizzy. Thus their journey begins. Meghan and Ash are soon joined by some old friends and set out on a quest to defeat the false iron king. Throughout the book, Meghan and Ash grow closer and closer and of course a dear friend makes his appearance as only he could do. There's an admirable amount of character development in this book, most notably seen in Ash and secondly in Meghan. The ice cold Prince is warming up and some of his gestures throughout the book are downright swoon-worthy and heart breaking. Meghan faces life or death choices at an age when she should be worrying about prom, zits and getting a car. The amount of wisdome she develops Puck is, as always, unforgettable and loyal to the end; Grimalkin, my favorite kitty is wise and fickle as ever but even he has non-Grimalkin like behavior, nothing that's outright, just revealing a little more of himself then he ever has before. Meghan's character has progressed perfectly with each story's challenges and she becomes courageous in the face of danger while remaining altruistic and compassionate. Her love for Ash and Puck is a constant struggle amongst the three of them though she loves them both very much, she loves them differently. She is a heroine that is worthy of respect and someone who can be looked up to for her character and sense of spirit. I was pleased with the introduction of all the new characters and in order to keep this as spoiler free as possible I'll not mention any names. I'll just say that within the iron fey there are many Machina loyalists that recognize the false king for what he is, false, cruel and power-hungry. They know if the false king were to capture Meghan his strength will only grow thus allowing his tyranny to continue. For the Fey Meghan's capture could put NeverNever at risk of becoming NeverAgain as the iron destroys more and more of Faery. I will say that the ending left me with soggy tissue and red-rimmed eyes but also with the hope that things will continue on. *Complements of NetGallej ...more The false king is still trying to take over the Nevernever and he needs one more thing to accomplish his goal: the power of the Iron King.

Summer and Winter will work together to overcome their biggest enemy, something that hasn\u2019t been done in a very, very long time.

You\u2019d think it\u2019s impossible for a writer to come up with a series of books that just keeps on getting better and better. You know the characters, you\u2019ve been through a lot of things with together and you\u2019d think you\u2019ve seen it all right? Wrong. This might be a weird way to compare things but reading The Iron Daughter was like putting on a comfortable pair of shoes: you already remember how much you love wearing them after a few steps. I\u2019ve grown to love these characters; their personalities, their wit, the strong bond they share\u2026 This feeling is the strongest with the ones we are most familiar with, but even the ones we only met briefly, or the ones who are already gone played a very specific part in this story, each being an ingredient for a very potent formula. Fast-paced, never a dull moment and action packed: this is the shortest way to describe this book. It\u2019s impossible to compare the Meghan we met in the Iron King to the Meghan we\u2019re following now. Her character slowly blossomed, going from being a little girl to becoming a strong, confident woman. A leader and a warrior. Her relationship with Ash is one of the most beautiful I\u2019ve read about so far. Their love for each other developed at a believable pace, unlike so many other young adult books you read these days, making it strong and unbreakable. More and more, they became equals, ready to die for each other and do whatever necessary. I\u2019m on the edge of my seat, eagerly awaiting The Iron Prince\u2019s entrance, banners and everything. ...more Now, I don't know if I'm in love or if I'm pissed.

That is, if they can survive it.... Wow, I don't even know where to start. It's incredibly difficult to write a review with out wanting to scream exactly wants on your mind with out giving everything away. If this was a couple of months later then this would be written in an entirely different tone, but for now, this will have to do. I'm always floored every time I go back to Julie Kagawa's world. It's so vivid and alive. Rich with madness, magic and mayhem that you can picture ever single creature, monster and character it's almost like watching a movie in your mind. Pure greatness. This book was my favorite by far, it's non-stop wonders, on the edge of your seat suspense and swoon-worthy moments that turned my insides into goo. What can I possibly say about these characters that I haven't said already? I adore them? I love them? It just doesn't sound enough. There is a different side to Ash that we get to see. In the previous books we see our Winter prince serious, reserved, obeys his queen and denies his heart, but in this book Ash shows his true colors, and it's beautiful. Ruined-me-melts me-owns me, Beautiful. Seriously, it's almost criminal how delicious one character can be. The one thing that I simply adored about Puck is his great humor, but he felt rather wounded in this one and I wasn't use to it, the humor is still there mind you, but I guess it just feels...bitter. Not that I blame him though, still, if I had to pick one best friend in the literary world, then it would be Puck. It was wonderful to see how much Meghan has grown. She's shown great strenght and determination to see things the way they should be. Even if sacrifices has to be made. I enjoyed meeting a lot of new characters, always so animated and entertaining. I don't want to say to much about the ending, and how much I cried. Or the romance, and how much I cried. Happy tears or sad? I can't tell you, but I will say that while this isn't exactly the ending that I wanted to happen, I'm still content with the way things played out. It's the way things should be and I'm pleased that Julie remained faithful to her characters and the world they live in. But, dammme what an ending!?!?! Basically, I just loved the hell out of this book and this entire series. It's always so much fun getting lost in this universe and swooning over these characters and I'm thrilled that the adventure doesn't stop here but continues on with Ash, in THE IRON KNIGHT!! If your ever going to pick up a Fey series, even if you don't care for this particular paranormal lore, then this is the series your going to want to read. It's thee best!

As much as I liked the scenes with Meghan and Ash.... \"What would the girl be willing to part with.

Although I did feel really sorry for Puck. \"Oh, I don't know, princess. Maybe it was because I was stupid enough to care about you. Maybe I actually thought I had a chance. Silly me, thinking that one little kiss meant anything to you.\" That was not nice, Meghan. I understand why she did it, though. Puck is awesome. I admit that I was a bit taken aback by Ash's confession about having seduced and pretty much killed a human girl. That was...sad to hear. \"Not having a soul frees us from any sort of conscience. She was only human, and a foolish one at that, to fall in love with a fairy.\" But I forgive you, Ash. You love Meghan now, so I guess you've changed. <3 The ending was absolutely amazing. Like, wow.

I love how it's all coming together. Puck just leaps off the page. The gremlins are so cute! This one is my favorite of the series so far. I adore Ash. I enjoyed both Iron King and Iron Princess, but IRON QUEEN is definitely the clincher. As can be told from my waxing on an on about Ash (see below if you don\u2019t mind spoilers,) I am a big fan of his: Initially, I was all for Puck, but events in Iron Princess and Iron Queen have turned me into a card carrying member of team Ash. Though he is a big reason for my loving the series, he is not the only reason. Another reason is the fact that I cried. Now, I cry at the drop of a hat, but the events in I enjoyed both Iron King and Iron Princess, but IRON QUEEN is definitely the clincher.

Though he is a big reason for my loving the series, he is not the only reason. Another reason is the fact that I cried. Now, I cry at the drop of a hat, but the events in this book were just so heartbreaking gut wrenching sad; I was surprised to see/hear myself bawl (as I did when Sofia Coppola died in Godfather III.) Who would have thought Meghan would grow a backbone? In Iron King, I absolutely abhorred her. Not merely because she had caught the Winter Prince\u2019s eye (grrr,) but because of the way she was: she was more middle school fiction instead of YA fiction material; juvenile. In Iron Princess, I came to tolerate her more, because at least there she showed some maturity. But in Iron Queen, she vacillated between her Iron King self and Iron Princess self, well at least in the first half of the book. In the second half of the book, I was a bit surprised even impressed by her choices and the turn of events. (That bit was the one that made me cry.) Ash. Where do I begin? Again see below for my fan girl review. Then, what the\u2026 Puck! Feeling used and bitter over not being chosen by Meghan, he still makes a reappearance in Iron Queen with the same humor and sarcasm, but with a bit more acid to him. Who wouldn\u2019t be put off after being used, then dumped? Should I love his dogged determination to be there for her (even if, I think, she didn\u2019t deserve it; even after everything she had done?) Or should I find him pathetic for the very same reason? I find myself torn between those two opinions. ____________________________________________________________ **Stop here if you hate spoilers** After her spectacular exit in Iron Princess, Meghan thinks she\u2019s home free. She couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Realizing that as the half breed princess with an affinity for both summer and iron magic, everyone, and I mean everyone, will come after her and Ash, she seeks refuge with the Queen of the Exiles. The main draw for me is, was, and forever, will be ASH. If I were Julie Kagawa, this is how some of the conversations would go: *begin delusional imaginary dialogue between me and the characters* First bit: Meghan thought, \u201cI was human; he was an immortal soulless faery. What kind of future did we have together? I would eventually grow old and die; Ash would live on forever, or at least until the mortal world became too much for him and he simply ceased to exist.\u201d To which I would say, \u201cBoy, if I had my way, nothing. You guys wouldn\u2019t have a future together\u2026 Ash is mine!\u201d First, that she fears aging so much; that she fears him staying forever young reminds me a little too much of a certain sparkly vampire against whom I hold nothing but fond, fond memories. Second, if I were in her shoes I\u2019d lap up the time I would have with the Winter Prince. Second bit: \u201cYou know what I feel for you. You know I\u2019ll protect you from whatever comes at us, but this is the one thing I can\u2019t fight.\u201d \u201cAsh-\u201c \u201cIf you\u2019re torn about whether you want to be with Goodfellow, tell me now. I\u2019ll step down, give you space, whatever you want me to do.\u201d Ash trembled, just a little, as he said this\u2026. Just answer me this today, and I\u2019ll never ask you again. Do you love him?\u201d Woohoo! That has got to be my favorite line this year. I get this little tingle going up and down my spine whenever I read it\u2026 I mean Ash trembled. He trembled!!! *end delusional imaginary dialogue between me and the characters* Enough of my raving about Ash. Oh, wait. Just one more: He definitely stepped up to the plate. In previous books, he was the epitome iciness. Here we get to know a lot more of him. I should stop talking about Ash. There I\u2019m stopping. There, I stopped. Now, I\u2019d still give IRON QUEEN 4 stars. And here\u2019s why: ** Puck. When I first started with the series, I was rooting for him and though Ive switched teams (go Ash!) I still think Puck is great BFF material. He\u2019s the comic relief, but he has matured. He is not just a sidekick longing secretly for the girl, because let\u2019s face it, the secrets out. Rejected, and a bit bitter\u2026 I thought he added a little more edge to the book. **Leanansidhe. OK Who would have thought that she would simplify matters for Meghan: \u201cLike it or not you\u2019re balanced on the edge of everything- faery and mortal, Summer and Iron, the old ways and the march of progress. Which way will you fall? Which way will you choose?\u201d The only part that I didn\u2019t like so much was, sad to say, the heroine. Particularly at the beginning of the book. Peevish, whiney and mercurial are some of the words that come to mind. Who could blame her for acting that way? Especially given everything she had to go through (a kidnapped brother, a boyfriend who almost dies?) I just wish that the mature side that she showed in Iron Princess showed more here. Well it does/did, but I think Iron Queen is where Ash got to shine. Finally, is that really the way it ends? ___________ Favorite lines, lines and more lines: * \u201cThere is one constant in your future, child, and that is pain. Pain and emptiness, for your friends, the ones you hold dearest to your heart, are nowhere to be seen.\u201d *\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re reasonable.\u201d \u201cSomeone has to be.\u201d *\u201cLike it or not you\u2019re balanced on the edge of everything- faery and mortal, Summer and Iron, the old ways and the march of progress.

First I was totally like, hes emo and weird and just keeps everything to himself, but now looking at Prince Ash, all I could think is, \"Daaayuumm, he IS something.\" ^.^ Hes hot and brave and a kind of boyfriend every girl in this freaking world deserves. Team Ash when hes with Meghan :D Win#2 Puck. He is my favorite character in this book. I will always be TEAM PUCK, no matter what. And its not because he deserves Meghan or something, its because even though she didn't love him, he loved her and accepted her decision to be just friends. He always fought for her, made her smile and feel better, always supported her no matter what and I think no one in this book has suffered more than Puck, besides Ash. I think hes feels as much guilt as Ash for Ash's ex-girl friend's death and I just love him. Win#3 The Story was really really good. Even though I didn't like Part 1 because of Meghan being against Puck, I adored Part 2 and 3. The story flowed and each and every scene was perfect in it's time. The ending was huge and marvelous and it just made me want to grab Iron Knight right now. Win#4 Julie Kagawa. Do you know you are in my top 10 authors right now? She wrote this book beautifully and each and every part was described nicely. I am just surprised that how can an author write a book so good?! Julie Kagawa is a really amazing author and I won't even give a second thought before marking any of her other books as-read now. Win#5 If theres anyone I love along with Puck and Ash, I would definitely say Grimalkin. This cat is such a nice character and I think if he wasn't there in this series, then Meghan and all would have been long dead. He was so sarcastic and confusing sometimes, even I was like ^_- when he said, \"I am a cat.\" after each and every question. Win#6 I love how the author also focuses on Meghan's family issues because most of the YA authors would have forgotten about them after the first book. I especially loved that moment when Meghan explains everything to her family and also when she calls Oberon \"father\". Her 2nd dad, Paul's mystery also got solved and I am just happy for her family. =) Win#7 And do you know, theres a spin off of this series, in which her brother, Ethan is going to be the main hero?! I am just so excited to read more and more books related to this series. I will give this book 4.5/5 stars! -0.5 for Meghan slapping Puck. I was very sad. But anyways, :) Iron Knight, here I come. ;) ...more Favourite Quote: \"His forehead bumped softly against mine, his brilliant silver gaze searing into me. \u201cI plan to keep you, from everyone, for as long as I\u2019m alive.

So I was extremely excited to get ARC but was also a little worried that it wouldn't live up to the previous books. But there was no need to worry as The Iron Queen was AWESOME. It had the same action packed and surprise filled plot but it was also was more emotional (tears were shed) and had more loads more delicious romance (yay!) than before. My favourite element of this series is the magical world Julie Kagawa has created. I love all the different creatures. There are so many it hard to keep up. Here is just a few: gliders, spider hags, packrats, gremlins, iron beetles, clockwork golems, hacker elves, dragons, iron horses, gryphon, musket elves, wireman\u2026. Kagawa makes you wish that you were character in this book exploring Nevernever. And if you asked me which character I would love to explore Nevernever with I couldn't pick. I am constantly changing my mind about who is my favourite. Ash, Razor, Meghan, Grim, Puck, they are all amazing. Meghan in the beginning is a little insecure (not in a bad and whiny way) but as the story goes on she becomes strong, confident and courageous. Ash is still the same gorgeous dark faery but he seems a little more open and happier. Puck however is a little more brooding this time but still manages to bring a sense of mischief and fun when he is around. Grim, definitely hasn\u2019t changed as Puck says \u2018He\u2019ll show up when we least expect him, being all cool and mysterious I wouldn\u2018t worry about that furball.\u201d . We are also introduced to some new characters Glitch and Razor. I have especially taken a liking to Razor, a gremlin, he is both cute and crazy and I want one. The romance is beautiful. Although sometimes I would have liked a little more details. Hint, hint for next time (I hope Julie Kagawa is reading this). The ending, I can\u2019t say much because I don\u2019t want to spoil it but I am very happy that Julie Kagawa is writing The Iron Knight and lets leave it at that. Overall, fans of this series won\u2019t be disappointed. And if you love fey tales or fantasy and you haven\u2019t read this series you really need to do so immediately.

But no - I got to be surprised (although I sometimes feel so unsurprisable): In most parts I liked The Iron Queen almost as much as The Iron King and in some parts (i.e. the number of Grimalkin dialogues, the multiple, fantastic steampunk elements, the Puck-and-Ash-banter and Meghan's personal growth) I think it even surpassed it in my eyes. Before reading The Iron Queen my guess about The Iron Knight /Ash's story was that we would be told some ancient story about his former self wooing Ariella or losing his soul or growing a heart or battling his brothers, but now I am pretty positive that Julie Kagawa is going to treat us with a narration of what happens after The Iron Queen - in Ash's point of view. I cross my fingers that I am right. There has to be a way. And please, Mrs. Kagawa, write some awsome new series on the side, won't you? I bet it will relax you in the evenings after hours of tweaking Ash's musings and Puck's teasings.

What live to life - a Fey and a Half Breed, what future could they have in the human world? When they reach Meghan's home, she's scared since it's been a year she was home. We don't have to wait long for Meghan being attacked - again from Iren Fey. This is when she realized that her journey has not ended yet and that she has to face the Iron Fey once more. Yet, she has no clue how big the threat became and lives and a whole world depends on Meghan's courage and decisions. Gosh how I loved this girl! Meghan in this book is not the Meghan we got to know in the Iron King. She's grown up, the happenings in with the Iron Fey and the Iron King changed her, made her even braver. She begins to realize what she can do, what powers lay inside her and that she has to use them. I adored her bravery and also her loyalty to people that were nothing to her only a year ago, yet Meghan would do anything to defend them. She stands up and faces her destiny. Ash *swoon* .. he's the wonderful Ice Prince Meghan fall in love with and he is all that she could ever hope for. FInally separated from the cold Unseelie Court Ash begins to lighten up. His love for Meghan is endless and he would do anything to protect her, to make her happy - he would even give his life for her. Always by her site he also encourages her to fight, to go out of her comfort zone to be the girl she was ever meant to be. But he's also insecure and scared and that makes him even more adorable! His possessiveness makes him the guy every girl dreams about. Truly, I was Team Ash right from the beginning - now I'm even more! Puck and Grim are the ones that makes you laugh when everything seems darker and darker, they are the light source in every Iron Book so far. Grim is his usual annoying, sarcastic self that tries to hide how much he cares for Megh and Puck (although heartbroken form Megh's choice) will make you laugh and cry at the same time. While reading this book, I felt like a movie is running behind my eyes. Julie managed to describe the places Meghan, the boys and Grim have to visit so that I was always stunned in amazement thinking how that would look on a big screen. This.Would.Be.Incredible! I was sobbing so hard during the last 10% of the book. Get your Kleenex ready when getting to this part, I promise your eyes will be red after you finished this book. The end will leave you speechless, I promise you this too! You will be torn between how you wish this book will end and how you know this book has to end. Let me just say this: If I wouldn't know that there will be \"The Iron Knight\" coming out next year, I would be desperate! Bottom Line: The Iron Queen was the epic, enthralling and heart breaking third book in The Iron Fey saga. You will cry from heartbreak and you will fall in love with those amazing characters all over again. If you haven't started the first book yet, get it - you won't be disappointed and love this amazing and wonderful world Julie Kagawa created. ...more I learned that love can transcend race and time, and that it can be beautiful and perfect and worth fighting for but also fragile and heartbreaking, and sometimes sacrifice is necessary.

That is not one, but two , TWO series where she has literally (I DO MEAN LITERALLY) killed me with the endings at the pique of the series. People. I am telling you now-I love peril and I love action and I LOVE the climax of a story but rarely am I a blubbering, incoherent mess of emotion during these aforementioned scenes. In The Iron Queen I laughed, I swooned, I cried, and I literally fucking fell apart as the ending unraveled. I didn't know what I was going to say about this book because it is just so hard to express how epic you believe it is in terms that others can interpret and apply to their own thoughts and beliefs, because once they get in their head that I think something is epic, they think surely something awesome happens that will blow them away...but everyone is different in their levels of astonishment and awe and I have learned that many times before-but I can't deny what I thought this book was: Epic. Ash pulled back slightly, his silver eyes bright as he stared at me, his cool breath washing over my heated face. \"You are beautiful, you know that, right?\" he murmured, all seriousness, one hand gently framing my cheek. \"I know I don't say...things like that...as often as I should. I wanted to let you know.\" Book three. Oooooh book three how will I explain you spoiler free for my friends who are considering reading this series? Something happened in book two that lead to undesirable circumstances for Prince Ash and completely ideal circumstances for Meghan...to an extent. So, we start book two with Ash and Meghan...in a precarious state they never imagined possible. After the events leading to this, the Iron Kingdom, the false Iron King, and all of his minions are after Meghan so they can bring her back to their land where her power can be used to fuel the false king...and make him the strongest of all of Nevernever-which would mean the end of the summer and winter courts (Prince Ash, Grim, and Puck included) and everyone that calls Faery home. \"One more thing,\" Ash said in his dangerous, soft voice as we turned away, and Glitch shot him a wary look. \"If you do not return with her,\" Ash continued, staring him down, \"if she comes to any harm while she is with you, I will turn the entire camp into a bloodbath. That is my promise, lieutenant.\" Meghan has become a complete badass. She was good for most of the book and even most of the last book, but in this book, we see a fierce, strong-willed, and impressive girl who has done a complete turn around since book one. She had to make some tough decisions and she didn't always know what to do, but in the end, she kicks ass, and there was no way she couldn't have earned respect from everyone who reads of her battle against the false Iron King to save all of Nevernever. After all...the fate of the whole Fey world sits on her shoulders. \"You tell the false king he doesn't have to send anyone to get me,\" I said in the firmest voice I could manage. \"I'm coming for him. I'm coming for him, and when I find him, I'm going to kill him.\" And Ash. Oh Ash. I need my review gush session for the amaaaazing Prince Ash lol. But what is so funny about Mr. Ash is that....all he does is brood and tell Puck off-AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HIM! Whyyyy is this guy under my skin so deep? What is it about him that makes me squee and fangirl and obsess over him so? I don't know what makes him so special to me, but he is. His sole purpose has become to protect Meghan, to love her, to save her from those who mean her harm-his sole existence is this human girl who came out of nowhere and turned his dark world upside down, bringing him out of a deep depression and the darkness that has plagued him for years and drawing him back into the light. He is loyal, protective and now wears his heart on his sleeve...and I love him. (If I hadn't mentioned that before ;)) His lips touched my hair, very lightly. \"I won't let anything happen to you,\" he murmured. \"You are my heart, my life, my entire existence.\" I don't think I'm going to say much more...my last three or four reviews (if you include the novella) have been more than forthcoming on information and, frankly, at this point, I've probably said too much. All I can say and express is how shocked, happy, and surprised I am that this series has became a favorite of mine-I think this just goes to show that it doesn't matter how out of your comfort zone a book or series is, it's how the author writes it. It's how that author appeals to you and draws you in and most importantly-how they execute it. An epic novel with an epic conclusion that I will not soon forget, I am anxious for book four and how Kagawa will wrap this all up. I am a jumbled ball of nerves...but it's the best feeling in the world. He stopped and looked down, his voice dropping to a near whisper. \"And I'm afraid. I'm afraid I'll fail you like I did Ariella, that the crimes of my past will ruin any chance we have at a future. That you'll realize who I really am, what I really am, and when I turn around you'll be gone.\" Ugh, and AGAIN I have ran out of room to put my special quotes I had highlighted for this review and have to stop....but here are two quotes that I HAD TO SHARE...but can't. They are spoilered-look at them at your own risk. (view spoiler) [ \u201cMy name is Ashallyn'darkmyr Tallyn, third son of the Unseelie Court...Let it be known--from this day forth, I vow to protect Meghan Chase, daughter of the Summer King, with my sword, my honor, and my life. Her desires are mine. Her wishes are mine. Should even the world stand against her, my blade will be at her side. And should it fail to protect her, let my own existence be forfeit. This I swear, on my honor, my True Name, and my life. From this day on...\" His voice went even softer, but I still heard it as though he whispered it into my ear. \"I am yours.\u201d (hide spoiler) ] annnnndddd the one that tore my heart out as I relentlessly sobbed- (view spoiler) [ A soft noise, almost a sob. Ash rose, hesitated, as if fighting the compulsion to obey. \"I will always be your knight, Meghan Chase,\" he whispered in a strained voice, as if every moment he remained was painful to him. \"And I swear, if there is a way for us to be together, I will find it. No matter how long it takes. If I have to chase your soul to the ends of eternity, I won't stop until I find you, I promise.\" And then he was gone. (hide spoiler) ] Gaaaaaah!

But of course, these two couldn\u2019t stay out of the NeverNever for long and they\u2019re soon sent right back into the middle of the war between the Summer and Winter Courts and the Iron Fey. Due to Meghan\u2019s half-human heritage, she\u2019s the only one who can enter the Iron Realm without getting hurt and so is sent by King Oberon and Queen Mab to kill the false Iron King once and for all, with her two loyal bodyguards\u2019 right by her side. And there was so much action and character development and great moments throughout the book, I truly enjoyed myself. Meghan has completely transformed herself into a strong and brave Leader whom others will very happily and loyally follow. While I disliked her in the previous two books, I just had to cheer her on in this book, she was so awesome! She had so many doubts about herself and her abilities; about who she was meant to be. Was she a human living in the fey world? Or was she where she truly belonged? Well, these all disappear in this book, and she truly comes into her own here. Now that Ash and Meghan became an official couple, the romance was simply\u2026 well, gushy. The loyalty between those two is something to be admired, and Kagawa wrote it beautifully. I honestly can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m a Puck or Ash girl as both boys love Meghan differently but just as fiercely, but I still can\u2019t deny that Meghan and Ash were on fire. Puck will always be in love with Meghan and stick tight to his princess for as long as he can, but Ash and Meghan\u2019s chemistry made me fan myself in some places. I can\u2019t help but love Puck\u2019s loyalty, though. (view spoiler) [The title of the book makes it a little obvious as to what Meghan\u2019s true role is in the Faerie world. She\u2019s not just Oberon\u2019s daughter and a Summer Princess; she\u2019s an Iron Queen too. (hide spoiler) ] She has to prove herself and her powers on more than one occasion in this book but comes out on top every time. Kagawa has once again inspired a wonderful and creative world, mixing faery tales with fantasy, action and love. Her writing style is wonderful and I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who loves those elements in books. ...more 4.5 stars How I enjoyed this book!

How she annoys the crap out of me. In this book she was slightly better I have to give her that. At least she wasn\u2019t crying every five pages as usual. That\u2019s an improvement.

All the fighting and promises and vows and sacrifices, good Lord, it kept hooked till I had that feeling I needed to finish the book before I could move on with my life. So I already complained about Meghan, so I\u2019ll say that I love both boys , my favourite is Puck for sure. I love how funny he is, how loyal and also his looks. But I also love Ash and I\u2019m team Ash for sure. Not that I\u2019d be all heartbroken if she ended up with Puck, but still, Team Ash. But I hope that Puck ends up with someone and not in a grave, like a certain book I read quite recently. Still my favourite thing about this series is the world . I love everything about it. The creatures, the plants, the magic, the Fey . I find it fascinating, and reading about it makes me want to grow some pointy hears and a pair of wings (not that these fairies have wings but it\u2019d be cool nonetheless) and move to a wood cabin in the Summer realm, or to one of those castles. I\u2019d be a happy girl! Now I think I\u2019ll be reading the last book, I feel like reading it and I don\u2019t know when that will happen again.

Reality slaps Meghan in the face, a moment The Iron Queen Five stars: The Iron Queen is the best book yet! Meghan and Ash stumble out of the Nevernever; anxiously they look to find their way in the mortal world. Meghan stands on the threshold of her home, eagerly anticipating a family reunion and reemergence into her former life. Before she can knock on the door, the Iron Fey attack and Meghan and Ash are once again thrust into the conflict. They should have known they could not escape so easily. Reality slaps Meghan in the face, a moment of pause, and then reluctantly she turns away from her old life. She knows that no matter where she goes the Iron Fey will follow. Her only choice is to meet the new, false Iron King head on and destroy him. With every passing day the deathly fingers of the Iron Fey scrape further and further into the realm of Faery; corroding and poisoning everything they touch. In Meghan lies the final gasp of hope for the salvation of the Nevernever. She alone wields the power to destroy the Iron King. Accompanied, as always, by her two, trusty, noble companions Ash and Puck and the wise, furball Grimalkin she heads into the twisted, dark, ravaged land of the Iron Fey. Will she somehow find the strength and courage to once again defeat the Iron King? If so, at what price? Normally, I would tell you all the things I like about this book, such as the characters and the setting etc. I think in my two prior reviews of this series I established my feelings on the awesome characters and the extraordinary worlds so I will forgo that part, except I will impart a couple of quick thoughts on the characters. Meghan at last (big standing ovation) she evolves into the brave, formidable girl I knew she was capable of becoming. Ash, he is noble and tender and I can finally see why he is the perfect fit for Meghan. Puck, I still love him the most and I am glad he is able to reconcile his feelings and remain a steadfast friend. The beloved Grimalkin is ever my favorite. This sage, apathetic cat stays staunchly at Meghan\u2019s side, where he is quick to shed light into the dark and point out the obvious things that she so often misses (especially when I feel like smacking her with a board and saying \u201cHello there are the gremlins don\u2019t you get it?\u201d). This time we see the other side of the Iron Fey and understand that they might not be as evil as once thought. Ironhorse paves the way for this enlightenment and Glitch and the others finish his task by assisting Meghan in bridging over the sea of misunderstanding that stands between them and the Old Fey. This book has it all, high octane action,war,surprises and of course heartfelt, tear jerking scenes that will melt the hearts of even the stoic. If you liked the first two books, you will love this one, it far surpasses it\u2019s predecessors. I admit I struggled with book two, The Iron Daughter, especially with the emotional, love drama between the three characters. Looking back I can see that all the upheaval was necessary to establish a solid foundation to aid in Meghan\u2019s growth and help the reader understand why she chooses Ash over Puck. After reading the three books I now have a deeper insight into the Ice Prince\u2019s heart and I see that it is right for Meghan and Ash to be together. Ash because of his past and his frozen emotions is the type that cannot allow himself to fall in love frivolously. When he gives his heart away it will be forever, for he can only love wholeheartedly and deeply. Puck, who is ever merry and finicky, I don\u2019t think has it in his nature to commit to one girl and remain content until the end of his days. I believe he will love often and without restraint; he is a free spirit after all. Finally, my thoughts on the Iron Fey and the war waged in Nevernever. It is a fight between the old ways and the new technological wave. Just like in our world today, you have the staunch, steadfast movement planted against the electronic wave of the future. Those who prefer the simpler things, a paper book, records, newspapers, radio, etc. versus the youth of today, who have every technological gadget at the fingertips, smartphones, ipods and ipads, e readers and the internet. It is the same in the world of Faery, you have Mab and Oberon and the two courts, rooted in the ways of the old, opposing the Iron Fey. Each side entrenched in their beliefs. At first you hate the Iron Fey but then you see that they are the product of societal advancement. In fact, most of us are guilty in aiding the rise of the Iron Fey and to the decline of the Nevernever (myself included as I type this review on my ipad after I finished reading the book on my Kindle). In reality there is no turning back, the technological generation is here to stay. In the Faery world there is a visionary moment and the three groups forge together to fight a common enemy. It is only appropriate that Meghan, a girl of both worlds, is destined to be the champion. She must somehow ultimately, cohesively bring these two worlds together. I wish that the title of the book was different because it is a giveaway to Meghan\u2019s final fate after some heart wrenching sacrifices. The ending will cause you to wipe away a few tears. Ash\u2019s last gift to Meghan absolutely melted my heart and it was a nice tie off of a remaining loose thread from book one that caused me anxiety. I expect Ash, Puck and Grimalkin to all be back in book four, The Iron Knight, for another mind blowing adventure and an epic ending. In the meantime, here in reality, I know we can\u2019t staunch the electronic flow in our world but we can take time to appreciate the small things. So, keep Nevernever alive and well by wishing on a star, finding hidden magic, looking for fairies in the flowers, gazing at the butterflies and dragonflies and peering into the shadows for the trickster Puck. Take time to hold a book, rub the glossy cover, finger the pages, and inhale the scent. Listen to old records, revel in the pop and scratching of the needle across the vinyl. Read to children and teach them to wonder and most importantly, how to dream. Share the books of the Iron Fey with others. In these little acts, we can assure our friends in the Nevernever long lives for many days to come. Favorite Quotations: \u201cI learned that love can transcend race and time, and that it can be beautiful and perfect and worth fighting for but also fragile and heartbreaking, and sometimes sacrifice is necessary.\u201d \u201cSo nice to see you as well human.\u201d Grimalkin blinked at me, sarcastic, unruffled, and completely infuriating.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see how you mortals do it, these feelings you must endure. They will ruin you, in the end.\u201d \u201cAn artist whose paintings almost sang with a life of their own, and a musician whose soul was intertwined in his music, their love only heightened their talents.\u201d \u201cYou could actually be doing something that doesn\u2019t make me want to gouge my eyes out with a spork.\u201d \u201cHe sighed, framing my face with his hands. \u201cMy life...everything I am...belongs to you.\u201d \u201cRemember, it ends at the beginning.\u201d \u201cNothing ever goes as planned-people fall in love with the wrong person, someone ends up with a donkey head, and then it\u2019s a whole big mess.\u201d \u201cOh, look, demon fey, lake of liquid hot magma---does this remind you of anything?\u201d He grimaced, giving me a weak grin. \u201cWhen I said I\u2019d follow you to hell and back, I wasn\u2019t trying to be literal princess.\u201d \u201cI have brought you as far as I can. It is time for you to step forward on your own and claim your destiny.\u201d \u201cYou are my heart, my life, my entire existence.\u201d ...more Wow! This one was certainly the best in the series so far! I mean... - Meghan has gotten more independent and gets much more mature. I like how she started getting lessons from Ash with a sword. She needed lessons ages ago. - The romance in the first half was a little annoying but it was pretty good on whole. I'm not exactly sure which team I'm on now. :| - Grim. AHHH love him! - Puck and Ash's banter was certainly something. Pretty entertaining. I love this series and hope to have this book done by the time I meet Julie this weekend! I'm back from a wonderful weekend - met Julie Kagawa and Mara Purnhagen, fellow Harlequin Teen authors and we had two wonderful book signings! I also finished Iron Queen on the plane ride home (it was a quick read). It was fantastic - the ending was tissue worthy, but there will be the Iron Knight from Ash's POV in November!! I can't wait.", "Title": "The Iron Queen"},
