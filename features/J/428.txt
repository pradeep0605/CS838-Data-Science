Then t Quirky loner girl meets privileged rich boy(s). Forbidden love and angst ensue. I seem to have this habit. For the past couple of years, I've mostly been deliberately avoiding paranormal YA from authors I don't already love. The genre is a hard sell for me, filled with tropes that lead to low ratings and irritated reviews. But really, what tends to happen is this: the first book comes out and I avoid it, look the other way as other bloggers get excited and fangirl over the upcoming sequel. Then the next book appears and more positive reviews roll in and,<---M> I admit</---M>, I start to get curious. But I ignore it. Then the third and often final book is about to be released and everyone is so damn enthusiastic that I... just... have to... check the series out. Yes, I am a fool. I am that cliche about the cat and curiosity. It's sad because I love a good paranormal tale, but I don't know if I'm just getting too old and cynical to read these supernatural romancey teen books. Either that or I've read one too many. Because I am honestly not sold on the big dilemma in this book. Basically... If Blue and Gansey kiss: he dies. If Blue and Gansey don't kiss: he lives. ...um, I\u2019m not really seeing a difficult decision to be made here. The only thing I'm seeing is a whole lot of melodrama and names that make the characters sound like horses. I know, I know, TRU WUV and all that, I am so cold. Well, forgive me if I\u2019m not caught up in this emo love angst, but could you please get over yourselves, choose life, and go find someone else. But no, of course not, because this book is largely about the will they/won\u2019t they, which is also likely what the following novels are about too. There is some good writing at points and a decent ghostly atmosphere; though I'm still not convinced two stars isn't leaning towards generous. The complex plot that has been so praised by critics and bloggers just bored the hell out of me . I guess it's imaginative in some sense and I haven't heard anything quite like it before - props for that - but it was soooo slow. And it seemed to take forever for the author to reveal WHY the Raven Boys were searching for some Welsh king, so I had no reason to invest in their mission. \u201cShe wondered what it would\u2019ve been like to kiss this hungry, desolate boy.\u201d And yes, then we have Mr and Mrs Angst. The usual relationship/love drama aside, I found it so difficult to like these characters. I have a hard time finding sympathy for a rich white boy with his own apartment and vintage car (at seventeen!), who wants to kiss a girl but can't. Blue isn't much better... overly quirky outcast - i.e. SPESHUL - who makes her own clothes and judges people she doesn't know. I kind of despise them both. But it's my fault. I knew it was a bad idea. I suck.

And it was constantly on my mind the next morning, I kept thinking about that fateful moment when I could just sit down and read it. I finished <+++>The Raven Boys</+++> in 2 sittings (although reading it at night was extremely scary for me). This book follows the events of <---C>Blue Sargent</---C>. Every year, Blue stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them\u2014not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her. His name is Gansey. \u201cThere are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark\u2019s Eve, Blue. Either you\u2019re his true love,\u201d Neeve said, \u201cor you killed him.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a night for her ordinary eyes. It was a night for seers and psychics, witches and mediums.\u201d \u201cIn other words, the rest of her family.\" I loved Blue\u2019s family. They captured my attention in the prologue and were the reason that I had to finish this book. I was so intrigued by them, they reminded me of my favorite family in The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender . I love it when I find books with families similar to The Strange and Beautiful family. There are also no words that can describe how much I appreciated Blue\u2019s mother, Maura. \u201cThe predictions that came out of 300 Fox Way were unspecific, but undeniably true. Her mother had dreamt Blue\u2019s broken wrist on the first day of school. Her aunt Jimi predicted Maura\u2019s tax return to within ten dollars. Her older cousin Orla always began to hum her favorite song a few minutes before it came on the radio.\u201d This book is mainly told from the perspectives of Gansey and Blue. Gansey is on a quest that has encompassed three of his closest friends: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little. I love books where we get multiple main characters. But it took me a few chapters to get used to Gansey\u2019s voice. His chapters felt a little slow-paced compared to Blue\u2019s. Initially, the only thing that made his chapters more interesting was when Ronan showed up. I found his character to be a lot more compelling than Gansey\u2019s. I really cared for Ronan (especially when he took care of his raven, Chainsaw) \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Blue asked. Holding her was frightening and lovely; she was such a small, tenuous little life, her pulse tapping rapidly against Blue\u2019s skin. Adam answered witheringly, \u201cChainsaw.\u201d The raven opened her beak wide, goggling even more than before. \u201cShe wants you again,\u201d Blue said, because it was clear that she did. Ronan accepted the bird and stroked the feathers on the back of her head. \u201cYou look like a super villain with your familiar,\u201d Adam said Ronan\u2019s smile cut his face, but he looked kinder than Blue had ever seen him, like the raven in his hand was his heart, finally laid bare.\u201d But the more I got into the story, the more my love for the characters grew. They all added something so heartbreaking to the story. The only time I remember really smiling (instead of crying) was when Gansey and Blue interacted with each other, they were so comfortable with one another and incredibly funny. I loved them. \u201cSorry that I\u2019m late,\u201d said the boy in front, with the square shoulders. The scent of mint rolled in with him, just as it had in the churchyard. \u201cWill it be a problem?\u201d Blue knew that voice. She reached for the railing of the stairs to keep her balance as President Cell Phone stepped into the hallway. Oh no. Not him. All this time she\u2019d been wondering how Gansey might die and it turned out she was going to strangle him.\u201d Blue was a great protagonist, she is one of the most unique females I've ever read. She is vulnerable but tough. She is clever but has moments of doubt. And her relationships with her family is heartwarming, especially with her mother. \u201cBlue could\u2019ve happily had any number of friends. And she had tried. But the problem with being weird was that everyone else was normal. So her family remained her closest friends, school remained a chore, and Blue remained secretly hopeful that, somewhere out there in the world, there were other odd people like her. Even if they didn\u2019t seem to be in Henrietta.\u201d And Adam Parrish broke a little piece of my heart. I was crying when I found out why Adam didn\u2019t show up at school the morning after Gansey called him at midnight about Ronan being missing. And when Gansey came to check on Adam, I was just in tears. I was so emotional. That part hit too close to home. I had to put down the book for a few minutes just to try and calm down. (Trigger Warning: Domestic Abuse) \u201cThe ripped knees of Adam\u2019s camo cargo pants appeared first, then his faded Coca-Cola T-shirt, then, finally, his face. A bruise spread over his cheekbone, red and swelling as a galaxy. A darker one snaked over the bridge of his nose. Gansey said immediately, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving with me.\u201d \u201cIt will only make it worse when I come back,\u201d Adam told him.\u201d But towards the end when Adam was confronted by his hideous father, and Ronan came to save Adam\u2014 there were tears just streaming down my face (I was so thankful that I was home alone). I love Ronan. And I\u2019m so emotional. \u201cHis father bellowed something else at him, but it was into his left ear, and there was nothing but a roar on that side. \u201cDo not ignore me,\u201d his father growled. And then, inexplicably, he turned his head from Adam, and he shouted, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d \u201cTo do this,\u201d Ronan Lynch snarled, smashing his fist into the side of Robert Parrish\u2019s face. Beyond him, the BMW sat, the driver\u2019s side door hanging open, headlights illuminating clouds of dust in the darkness.\u201d Ronan's reply broke me. <+++>The Raven Boys</+++> was definitely a book that astonished me with its beautiful writing style, memorable cast of characters, and complete uniqueness. I love books that can surprise me with how good and eccentric they are. Also, this song really fit the mood of the book for me. 4.5 stars *Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Her mother is usually the one who sees the spirits of people who will die within the next twelve months, but this year, Blue herself is startled by the sad, desperate sight of a boy named Gansey falling to his knees before her. \"There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark's Eve, Blue. Either you're his true love...or you killed him.\" With those chilling words, Blue is caught up in a mystery she never expected involving the privileged Raven Boys from Aglionby Academy. She must guard her heart closely, however, because Blue's always been told that she's destined to kill her true love with a kiss. If Edgar Allan Poe had taught the boys of Dead Poets Society , The Raven Boys is the type of tale he might've told, one that emerges through curl of smoke and excites with a flash of fire. This story, which seems to be loosely based on a real Welsh folk tale , is haunted by ghosts, invigorated by a fantastical search for a legendary sleeping Welsh king, and tinged with the frightening dark beauty of centuries-old magic. While the story starts out from Blue's point of view, the book is actually told in third-party omniscient style, a welcome change from the author's usual first person perspective, and a necessary one given the many characters we get to know, particularly the raven boys. Gansey , who is obsessed with the supernatural; Adam , who yearns for a life outside what he knows; Ronan , whose anger hides untold regret; and Noah , a troubled soul who knows more than he lets on. I loved the complicated relationship between these boys, from their good-natured jeers to their anxious concern for one another. There is a collegial feel to the book that I very much enjoyed, but beyond that, there is also a deeply felt connection and a mysterious synergy between the characters that I hadn't felt in the author's books since Shiver and Linger . It's a surprise to find that the strongest and most compelling facet of this novel isn't necessarily the romance--although that is also intriguing and incredibly complicated--but the brotherly love between this tightly-knit group of boys. (view spoiler) [The part where Adam is humiliated at the grocery store and the abuse just slayed me. I am a bigger fan of Adam's than of Gansey's at this point, shhhh. I also guessed what was going on with Noah, but it was still a pleasure to watch it unfold, particularly if you go back to the very beginning when he's first introduced. I did a happy wriggle in my seat when I re-read that part! (hide spoiler) ] There are several mysteries going on, all of which aroused my curiosity. I have to admit, however, there are so many characters and plot lines to keep track of that the first half of the book was occasionally bewildering and a little maddening. As with The Scorpio Races , I also find some of the names a bit distracting since there are so many unusual ones (although I do like some of them, including the rather gloriously pompous \"Barrington Whelk\"), and the propensity to overuse proper nouns when a simple \"he\" or \"she\" would do occasionally tried my patience. While I think the novel would be stronger overall if it was a little more focused and lost some of its cluttering details, these are small nitpicks in such an imaginative book, and the whirlwind of the second half definitely rewards those who stick with it. I liked that we see more of the author's offbeat humor in this novel, and her gift for seeing beauty in ordinary things still moves me. The air moved slowly around his body, somehow tangible, gold-flaked, every dust mote a lantern. I'm happy to find another <---A>Maggie Stiefvater</---A> book that I like so much and I'm incredibly excited to see where this story goes next. That cryptic ending--and the loose ends with Blue's romantic destiny--will guarantee that I'll be one of the first people in line for the sequel. For fans of intelligent mystery and fantasy, this unkindness of ravens is well worth your time. This review also appears in The Midnight Garden . An advance copy was provided by the publisher.

Which is... very ironic. It might be time for Maggie Stiefvater and I to part ways. Truly, there's nothing actually ''wrong'' with her style; it simply does not appeal to me.

There is this possibility to feel connected to the protagonists... but a slim and invisible barrier seems to continuously block that connection. Even for Ronan. The only character I like is Ronan.

Maggie Stiefvater narrates the story of how Blue Sargent met four strange boys, four boys she'd never expected she'd like or trust, but somehow she was caught in the middle of Richard Gansey's treasure hunt and she was the catalyst of every event that unfolded afterwards. Blue, Adam, Gansey, Ronan, Noah, they all had their fair share of secrets and pain, but only together they can unravel the mystery that cloaks their little town, from murders to paranormal activity and coincidences that are not coincidences. And Blue has to be careful, very careful, or else if she finds her true love in the face of one of the Raven Boys, she will cause his death. With one kiss. \u201cShe wasn't interested in telling other people's futures. She was interested in going out and finding her own.\u201d I wanted to read The Raven Boys for a while, but I was a little intimidated by the hype that surrounds this series. But it deserves it. While I've crossed paths with Maggie Stiefvater's books before, The Raven Boys took me by surprise. The foreboding , the hypnotizing and at times eerie ambience , the riveting plotline and the poetic writing , there was a sweet melancholy that settled in my heart and enchanted me. I could picture everything in blue, green and grey . The paranormal element was strong and gave me goosebumps, the characters' backrounds misty, and I couldn't help but inhale every word and feel the physical need to be part of the story, to join Blue and the Raven Boys in their adventures! \u201cAglionby Academy was the number one reason Blue had developed her two rules: One, stay away from boys because they were trouble. And two, stay away from Aglionby boys, because they were bastards.\u201d While all the characters were fascinating, I felt a little detached when I read Blue 's chapters, because she was mostly sensible and I didn't receive many emotions from her part. Surprisingly I didn't mind, her narrative was always interesting and I am positive I will establish a connection with her in the later installments! The boys though, well, they're a completely different story. Noah was the invinsible one, the shy and awkward boy who didn't speak that much, who was hurt and losing himself and I wanted to hug him and make everything alright for him. Ronan was cruel, rude, sarcastic and grumpy, but he had a caring side and he was so alluring, I wanted to know his secrets and the source of his pain, he was my second favorite character! Adam ,well, I still haven't made up my mind about him. He was silent, always observing and calculating, he didn't deserve this life and all the burdens he had to carry, but I think he was unfair towards Gansey. Sometimes I thought the only reason he sticked around was the treasure hunt. I understand he had principles and didn't like charities, but he made himself feel inferior, not Gansey. He kept complaining that he couldn't understand him, because he was born privileged, but when did Adam try to understand Gansey? \u201cMy words are unerring tools of destruction, and I\u2019ve come unequipped with the ability to disarm them.\u201d Needless to say, Richard Campbell Gansey III was my favorite . Yes he could be condescending or ignorant, but his heart was made of gold, he could be wise beyond his years, he acted and spoke like an old man and was so, so passionate about his goal. He usually wore a fa\u00e7ade that hid his inner depth, but one you glimpsed beneath his armor you couldn't help but love him! And for reasons unknown, I kept imagining him with an english accent. Admit it, it suits him perfectly! I won't talk about the romance because my ship has not sailed yet, but I think the foundations were set and I'm excited to witness Blue falling in love with the person she least expected! The Raven Boys added a new heart to their collection, a heart I willingly gave up! Oustanding job Maggie Stiefvater , you earned a new loyal fan! ...more Do I need to even explain myself? No?

It's almost frightening how accurately the writing fits the mood of this book. It's dreamy and magical and moody, but still very real and honest and grounded in reality. How she manages to combine to polar opposite things in such a well-executed way baffles me. Ex: \"She recognized the strange happiness that came from loving something without knowing why you did, that strange happiness that was sometimes so big that it felt like sadness. It was the way she felt when she looked at the stars.\" Enough said. The most unique plot. Talking trees in a magical wood, dead Welsh kings, and fast orange cars. But it's set in rural Virginia in the present day, and it's all tackled by sixteen and seventeen-year-old students and psychic women. And all of the feelings/ The first time I read this book I gave it 4 stars, but this book is like a fine wine; it gets better with age. I don't even think that metaphor works, but I don't care because I can't write as well as Maggie anyway and you need to go read this book now. The more I return to this series, the more secrets I will uncover, I'm sure. And that is what makes it a 5 star book for me.

Maggie Stiefvater\u2019s latest book has everything I want from a great reading experience, a complex narrative, an intriguing and highly developed cast of characters, an utterly haunting style of writing that just blew me away from the first sentence recounting a dire prophecy. Sadly, my enthusiasm dampened somewhat once I sensed Stiefvater was trying a bit too hard to set up a new series, leading to pacing problems and a disappointing ending that, for me, drops this book just a notch below absolutely amazing. But it\u2019s not often that I read a book where the words themselves feel magical, Stiefvater deserves mad props just for that. From the very first line of the prologue, hers are deliberately chosen to give off an unsettling, peculiar vibe that not only goes incredibly well with the supernatural tone and dark mood of the book, but really forced me to slow down, I really had to appreciate some passages word for word just to get a full sense of what\u2019s going on. Not that I minded, because I was fully attuned with the story and despite, or maybe because of, the offbeat writing, the chapters drew me in as they easily varied between a variety of emotions, solemnity, anger, incredulity, weariness, each just when the plot calls for it, only serving to enhance the narrative. But best of all, every so often there are these lines, simultaneously seeming strangely out of place and perfectly positioned, that highlight Stiefvater\u2019s dry sense of humor which never once failed to put a stupid grin on my face. I have to admit, this kind of heavy duty writing probably isn\u2019t for everyone, I\u2019d describe the book overall as muted yet dramatic rather than intense and bursting off the page, but for me, this is the exactly kind of writing that could make descriptions of watching mold grow not that bad of a read. Of course, this is not a book about watching mold grow. From the curious legend of Saint Mark\u2019s Day, the one day gifted psychics are able to see the soon to die as they file past on the corpse road, sort of a highway for spirits, Stiefvater has created an enormously complex tale centered around fate and expectations. Our heroine Blue Sargent, of course, grows up in a family of psychics, and is warned by her mother and her mother\u2019s friends, for as long as she can remember, that her true love\u2019s kiss is fatal. She\u2019s the sort of eccentric character who seems resigned and maybe a bit standoffish and too proud of her independence at first, and maybe Raven Boys takes a little too long bringing her and the Boys together and then putting them on their shared quest, opting for a couple of fake outs first, but once they all fall into that easy friendship I could not stop trying to figure out just what fate had in store for her. And it really is an expectations game, there\u2019s no quick and offputtingly shallow romance at work, rather Blue\u2019s character develops based on her early jaded expectations about true love thanks to that prophecy, and it\u2019s really a fascinating change for her as her future is slowly revealed. What really impressed me, though, was how Stiefvater manages to develop each one of the supporting characters in such memorable ways. Either through ridiculous names like Barrington Whelk\u2019s, or through hidden motives like Neeve\u2019s, or through strange behavior like Calla\u2019s and Persephone\u2019s, or through atypical parenting like Blue\u2019s mother Maura\u2019s, I never once thought, who is this character again, because I feel like I know them all. Each of the Raven Boys too, none of them fits into the rich snob stereotype I\u2019d have tagged them as, like Blue did initially, because the story sets aside time for each of them, Adam and his problems with his family and being the scholarship kid - though he did kind of annoy me by playing to the poor kid scraping by on his scholarship to the elite school stereotype, and Ronan and his problems with his brother and dead father. Even Noah, who stands out at first because I quickly noticed how not much is said about him, that\u2019s a huge clue towards his real identity. Really, how Stiefvater handles Noah\u2019s story is just brilliant. Though for me at least, the star of the show isn\u2019t Blue, it\u2019s Gansey. He has all these expectations piled on his as a result of his rich kid status, and his quest, the quest that becomes the Boys\u2019 quest, Blue\u2019s quest, finding the corpse road, the ley line, the path to a sleeping Welsh king, whatever you want to call it, that\u2019s sort of his way of putting himself on the map and doing something nobody expects from him. But his character, like Noah\u2019s, also ends up being indicative of how well Stiefvater has woven this incredibly complex story, there\u2019s clues and easily missed breadcrumbs along the way, like his allergy to bees, which just add layers and layers to his character as the story unfolds and new details emerge. I have to praise the writing again, it\u2019s really that great because Raven Boys is the kind of book that deserves a slow, careful read to really connect the dots. Not just for character development but for the plot as a whole, every time there\u2019s a new twist I can always think back to something I read previously and say to myself, oh yeah, I see what Stiefvater did there. For such a brilliant book, the only thing that bothers me is how much Raven Boys ends up feeling more like it\u2019s setting up sequels than being amazing in its own right. I\u2019m not talking about Ronan\u2019s final line really, or the many loose plot threads such as the significance of Blue\u2019s father that I\u2019m sure will be tackled by the books to come, those I can live with. Rather, it\u2019s a small part the pacing, intentionally holding back a few obvious revelations for maybe a few chapters more than necessary, and a big part the anticlimatical climax, certain things happening too conveniently and others being brushed aside before, yeah, it\u2019s all over for now. Sure, I get it\u2019s only starting, there\u2019ll be more conflict in the sequel, but after watching such a complex yet masterfully crafted plot unfold, I\u2019m kind of let down by the resolution. I wanted to say wow, I don\u2019t believe what I read and can\u2019t wait for the next book, but I didn\u2019t get that reaction. What I got in response to the events of the last chapter was a disappointing what the hell just happened. But don\u2019t let my one small complaint fool you, The Raven Boys is absolutely on my list of must read books. The writing is an experience unto itself, which is surprising, since I've never been a fan of Maggie Stiefvater's books - until now. ...more This book is why I give authors second, third, and sometimes even fourth chances (*cough* Colleen Hoover *cough*). Because while I might not enjoy one book they wrote, I like to think that doesn't mean I'll hate everything they publish. Take Stiefvater. I tried to read Shiver a while back, and my review for it is literally just this gif: This book is also why I believe in mood reading. I picked it up a while ago and got about 50 pages in before setting it aside. The opening is...not strong.

I picked it up a while ago and got about 50 pages in before setting it aside. The opening is...not strong. I mean, come on, hints of a love triangle, all that bullshit about fate (which, sorry, not sorry, I don't believe in), and a bunch of spoiled, mysterious rich boys (hmmm...where have I seen that theme a million times before? Oh, right! Every cliched YA book I've ever hated!). Totally not my scene. But so many of my friends rave over this series that I just had to give it a second chance. And boy, am I happy that I did. Because aside from the #richpeopleproblems this plot is pretty fucking original. Slumbering mythical heroes, living dead kids, a wood in which time is merely an illusion, and a female lead who, while slightly manic-pixie-dreamgirl-ish, has been raised to be her own person by a house full of eccentric women? Yeah, sign me up for that shit. All day long. One last gripe, since this is something that needs to be addressed in pretty much every book set in modern times: there is little to no representation of diversity or the lgbt+ community in here. I live near where this book is supposed to take place, so the lack of any people of color or lgbt+ characters really jumped out at me. ...more RE READ THIS BOOK AND OMG YES! LOVED IT A SECOND TIME ROUND Yesterday I walked into my library's Young Adult section which is inside its own special Young Adult room. There were all these kids hanging out playing video games when this bearded 31 year old man walked into the room. He was a man on a mission, a mission to quickly identify the YA Series section, track down the YA SER RAV label on the spine of The Raven Boys, and get the heck outta that room before anyone knew I (I mean he) was there. Mission accomplished. Then I walked around the library loo Yesterday I walked into my library's Young Adult section which is inside its own special Young Adult room. There were all these kids hanging out playing video games when this bearded 31 year old man walked into the room. He was a man on a mission, a mission to quickly identify the YA Series section, track down the YA SER RAV label on the spine of The Raven Boys, and get the heck outta that room before anyone knew I (I mean he) was there. Mission accomplished. Then I walked around the library looking for any other book to put on top of The Raven Boys so no one would notice what I was holding, which was the sole reason I even drove to the library in the first place. What do I do what do I do what I do? I searched for Welcome to Godot because I wanted to read that anyway. No luck. I tried Stephen King, a safe choice. Too many people in that section. So I just covered the book with my iPhone, checked out on my own, and rushed back to my car. Then I read through this book in less than 24 hours. I basically worked, slept, ate, watched two episodes of Stranger Things, and read The Raven Boys. Is it a good book? I guess. If I'm rating within the genre outside of the target audience, yeah it's fine. But then I have to wrestle with the fact that I basically devoured the book so maybe I'm too afraid or too embarrassed to admit that I really liked it. It has an interesting starting point and the story is fun. The characters are pretty cliche and the author reminds you over and over again what each character is dealing with or their background. But the story moves along well with plenty of twists and turns. There is some cool paranormal stuff, too. The whole concept of fate versus free will is also pretty cool, although it's never explicitly discussed in detail. I was worried the romance stuff would be way over the top. It wasn't. Blue is a lot cooler than Katniss. God, who am I? Anyway, the story takes precedence over any sappy love story even though the whole point is that she is going to kiss and kill someone. It could have easily gotten all young adult mushy, but it didn't. It's good, alright? I enjoyed it. Its fun. There. I feel better. I put the second book in the series on hold at the library already. So that happened. Maybe this time I'll walk in and out proudly, holding the book high in the air, singing its praises as I skip out of the library. ...more 4.5/5 stars \"Fortunate is the soul who finds the king and is brave enough to call him to wakefulness, for the king will grant him a favour, as wondrous as can be imagined by a mortal man.\" (Maybe mild spoilers?

Don't say I didn't warn you. Dear Raven Boys: The Raven Boys has been on my TBR for a very long time, until Zaira and Kainat (who I am now forever indebted to) finally convinced me to read this. Special thank to you guys: I am so glad I started this series. Maggie Stiefvater's writing is absolutely phenomenal. It captures the unique story beautifully, and completely sucks you in from the first line. Halfway through The Raven Boys, I had to put the book down and immediately order the rest of the series. I was practically cackling throughout this book as well. \"Gansey asked, 'Why are you carrying that bag? Oh my God, you have that bird in there, don't you.' 'She has to be fed every two hours.' 'How do you know?' 'Jesus, the Internet, Gansey.'\" \"'Gansey's partying with his mother,' Ronan said. He smelled like beer. 'And Noah's fucking dead. But Parrish is here.'\" \"'Blue. My name's Blue Sargent.' 'Blair?' 'Blue.' 'Blaize?' Blue sighed. 'Jane.'\" \"'We have to be back in three hours,' Ronan said. 'I just fed Chainsaw but she'll need it again.' 'This,' Gansey replied, 'is precisely why I didn't want to have a baby with you.'\" \"'Ronan said, 'I'm always straight.' Adam replied 'Oh, man, that's the biggest lie you've ever told.'\" Maggie sure knows how to write entrancing dialog, and equally wonderful characters. Oh, and speaking of characters... These characters will be the death of me . \"Blue Sargent had forgotten how many times she'd been told that she would kill her true love.\" Jane Blue: I actually quite liked Blue. She was tough and eccentric, and was determined to change her fate, regardless of what everyone told her. I loved how she wasn't psychic like the rest of her family, but she could amplify other psychics powers. To me, she was a refreshing change from the typical main character. (And her name is Blue! How cute is that? <3) \"'My words are unerring tools of destruction, and I've come unequipped with the ability to disarm them.'\" Gansey: Okay, I'll admit it. I love Gansey. I liked how he genuinely tried not to make other feel inferior to him because of his money, and how ridiculously proper he sounded all of the time. He did everything with a passion, and knew exactly what had to be done to fulfill it. \"The most important thing to Adam Parrish, though, had always been free will, the ability to be his own master. This was the important thing. It had always been the most important thing.\" Adam: Adam is my precious child, and no one else can tell me otherwise. He just such a sweetheart, and he's so kind, and caring, and I just love him so much. Also, no matter how many times he is explicitly described as having a Virginian accent, he sounds British in my head. They all sound British in my head. \"'Oh! Your hand is cold .' Ashley cupped her fingers against her shirt to warm them. 'I've been dead for seven years,' Noah said. 'That's as warm as they get.'\" Noah: I like Noah, but we didn't learn all that much about his personality in this book. So far, he has to be my least favourite raven boy, just because I don't really know him that well. (view spoiler) [ I do definitely sympathize for him, though. The poor guy died young, and in a pretty awful way, too. (hide spoiler) ] AND FINALLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE MOMENT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR: RONAN LYNCH Ronan fucking Lynch: I can now state, without a doubt, that I am indeed Ronan Lynch trash, and I would be lying through my teeth if I said I read this book for the other characters. No, I started reading this book because of Ronan Lynch . He's just such a complex, interesting, unknowable character that I will protect at all costs. Ronan's just...he's just...ugh, I can't even describe him. Hands down, he is by far my favourite character. And don't even get me started on him and Adam, because I will be here all motherfucking day. \"'You're looking for a god. Didn't you suspect that there was also a devil?'\" Though I was intrigued by the plot, for the most part, I really didn't care about ley lines, or Glendower, or any of that. In fact, I feel like the more critical part of myself would rate this 3.5 stars. But the characters, and the dialog, and the writing, were so amazing, I just couldn't bring myself to rate it any lower than a 5. But for Ronan Lynch, I'll pretty much do anything.

Since this is a character driven book I'll go over each character a little to give you some idea. =D The pretty one. \"Richard Gansey III had forgotten how many times he had been told he was destined for greatness.\" ^^ This is the first line of The Raven King (4th book). I read it at the BnN and I had a melt down right there and then. Don't ask. Okay, lets talk about Gansey, shall we? He sounds pretty cliche if you haven't read the book. He is extremely rich, well spoken, popular, good looking, everyone wants a piece of him. I might not have liked him at the beginning, were it not for that strange prologue. That prologue really pulled me in, and got me hooked. I honestly don't know how to explain Gansey. I have so much respect for this kid. He is kind of arrogant by nature but he tries to fight it. He is so cool he doesn't really fit in anywhere. He always has to be very careful about what he says around anyone. That is the most amusing and refreshing thing i have read in a long time. How he fits in the group? Gansey is the Glue that keeps all the boys together. They aren't friends with each other, they are all friends with him. Without him they'll probably rip each other into pieces, you'll find out soon why. He is obsessed with finding a dead welsh king. He's made it the mission of his life. There are predictions, this is the year he is going to die. Coca Cola T-shirt. Onto my second favorite raven boy, Adam Parrish. First of all, i love his name for some reason. My cousin had a baby boy last year, i insisted on naming him Adam. Now i have a nephew named Adam!! Adam is the only Aglionby student who doesn't come from a filthy rich family. In fact, he isn't rich at all, he lives in a trailer park with his parents. His father is an abusive alcoholic. Robert Parrish (his father) beats him and expects him to sport the family financially. I just wanted to protect him so bad. I feel this intense connection with Adam because he is the most relatable of all boys. While they all have their problems, Adam's are more real. I even cried for him. He works his ass off to pay for this insanely expansive school himself. He is determined to make something out of his life. Love for this puppy... i can't even. You wanna know what a character development looks like? You just keep an eye on Parrish throughout the series. I'm not even going to talk about his love interest. Let's just say it slapped me in the face. Made me the happiest person on this earth! AHHH!! The Psychic . Blue Sargent lives in a house full of physics, but she isn't one herself. Every woman in her family has the gift except Blue. She isn't completely useless, she is kind of like a battery: everyone's is much stronger when she is around. They are able to \"see\" more clearly. She gives them an energy boost, i guess. Every single psychic has predicted the same thing about Blue, she was destined to kill her true love with a kiss. I know how it all sounds, but trust me it's not cheesy at all when you actually read it. Let's do the math now. She is going to kill her true love + she met Gansey this year + Gansey is going to die this year... coincidence? I don't know. This was all very cute and fun, and i loved Blue in the first book. She was awesome! But i am not a fan of her in general. (view spoiler) [I hated that she went after Adam (Gansey's best friend) even though she knew about Gansey!!!! She ended up hurting Adam. (hide spoiler) ] This is the last thing he needs in his shitty life. I was so over her boy drama. Couldn't care less about her \"true love's kiss\". Actually, she made me not like Gansey. It got to the point where i pretty much started skimming through her parts. I do not like her at all. (view spoiler) [ not to mention that Raven King ending was just disappointing (hide spoiler) ] The Snake. Alright! Now my favorite raven boy! Gansey's devilishly handsome friend. The raven boy who was more raven than others. He even has a pet raven. \u201cRonan\u2019s smile cut his face, but he looked kinder than Blue had ever seen him, like the raven in his hand was his heart, finally laid bare.\u201d Alas! What can i tell you about Ronan Lynch? You have to experience it yourself. Whether you love him or absolutely hate the shit of him. The second book, The Dream Thieves, is his book. Everything that makes me love him is a HUGE spoiler. I'm still going to give this a try: At first, he feels like your standard rich spoiled Aglionby kid. But the thing is, he is not nice like Gansey. He isn't soft like Adam. He is just a sad broken soul, but he makes it impossible to make you feel bad for him. Ronan is kind of scary actually. Did i mention he swears a lot, and gets into fights? Let's just say, Ronan Lynch lived with every sort of secret. WOW, i did a pretty shitty job with him. Oh well. The troublemaker. Kavinsky is not actually in the first book. But since he is one of my favorite characters, i want to talk about him a little. I consider him a raven boy since he too attends Aglinoby. Joseph Kavinsky is what would have become of Ronan, had Gansey abandoned him. I personally love Kavinsky but he is obviously not right in the head. He is a psychopath. He is obsessed with Ronan (not that i blame him). I shipped them like crazy!!! Man, he is hilarious. I find it weird that more people don't like him. Sure, he is crazy but he is so well written. I love him!! His interactions with Gansey and Ronan were just the best. I died laughing. Two thumbs up for my boy, K! The smudgy one. Noah, Noah, Noah. Noah doesn't do much. He just tags along. Most of the time people don't even notice him. You can lose him in the background. I can't talk about him much. All i can say is he is precious!! Can we talk about his ending? It pissed me off!! What was that? If anyone has any idea, please let me know. I am still very confused. That's all for now. I'll probably re-edit this in a few hours. But that's it for now. =D[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more SO THIS IS A RE-READ BECAUSE I'M 100000% OBSESSED WITH THIS BOOK.

I love how visual and detailed it is, how her characters are so complex and dimensional and how she weaves in dry humour with mythology and DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. ERP. I need...I need a moment of intense howling. Ahem. Other Reasons The Raven Boys Are The World's Greatest Gift: \u2022 Did I mention it's like 100% character driven? It's in 3rd person (I LURVE) and it actually has a fair few narrators (usually I'm dubious; but obviously right now I LURVE) and it's just so... personal . And all the characters are complex and motivated and AJFDAKLFD ADORABLE. \u2022 Gansey. <3 Precious darling Gansey. He is like a mother hen. He cares SO MUCH for his little brood and it like cuts him to the bone when they don't love him back. LIKE HE'D DO ANYTHING FOR THEM. Gansey is the kind of friend anyone would want. Ergo I think he would appeal to mostly any reader. He cares . And he's just adorable, did I mention that? \u2022 And Blue...oh sensible snarky tiny Blue. I love how she hates being called \"sensible\". Like I used to get that too?? So no wonder I love Blue. But it's hard to be like inwardly eccentric and wild but also LOGICAL. Because people always see the logic and forget to look closer. I LURVE BLUE AND HOW ECCENTRIC SHE TRULY IS. Like the descriptions of her hair and clothes are everything . She is a bitter espresso of insane fantasticness. \u2022 Also there are, um, other Raven boys I should talk about. Is it easy to believe that I LOVE EVERY oNE OF THEM?!? Like, I'm never in love with ALL the characters. But I totally am here. Adam drove me really crazy the first time I read it. He has like soooo much baggage and he's abused so I GET IT. Like I think he's 1000% well written. But I hate how he treats Gansey a lot. Ronan is my DARLING BABY. He's all horrible and dark and stabby stabby, but he looks after a baby bird and afjdklafdj it melts. My heart melts. (view spoiler) [In other news, there are a ridiculous amounts of comments hinting that Ronan is not straight and I died laughing several times because he outright says it and they miss it. (hide spoiler) ] And also Noah. WHO I WILL ETERNALLY LOVE. He is like a wispy shy thing...and I also relate to that so, just hugs for Noah and let me sneeze with joy. (Sneezing with joy is a legit thing, okay? Plus I'm running out of ways to display my emotions.) \u2022 And also the supporting cast is amazing . Like Blue lives in a house of psychics and I really love that?!? Like there's so many WOMEN in this book and it's super refreshing. Plus they're old sort of weird and zany and awesome. Calla is my favourite because she's horrible. \u2022 Why, oh why, Cait, do you like all the horrible people? \u2022 I JUST DO GOSH DARN IT DON'T QUESTION ME. \u2022 And then there's the whole storyline of adventure and discovery and life . How does it even mix so well?! Like it puts magic into the modern world and it's EFFORTLESS. If someone walked up to me right now and said \"Let's go look for a dead Welsh king\" I'd be like \"Too right mate, let's go.\" \u2022 THERE IS SASS . The dialogue is just AMAZING. I snickered. I HICCUPED WITH JOY. I wailed. \u2022 There's also a lot of foreshadowing, um, if you've read the next two books and then go back to this one. Foreshadowing that freaking hurts . But it just proves what an incredible GENIUS Maggie Stiefvater is to be setting up SO SO MUCH from book 1. \u2022 I listened to the audio book...and honestly? It wasn't my favourite audio. Mostly because the narrator had this drawly southern accent (which I assume is what the book's describing as the characters' accents?) but so the book seemed to take especially LONG. And his accents were AWFUL. Plus not consistent. One moment Calla is gravelly, the next she's squeaking. Like, wut? I wish he'd just read it all in a normal voice and skipped the \"voices\" and then it'd have been fine. But I still liked the audio because I feel like I absorb SO MUCH MORE that way. \u2022 I'm literally sobbing right now because I want the Raven King and yet I don't want it. IS EVERYONE GONNA DIE???? OMG. \u2022 I just cannot love the writing and the characters and the story enough. I like...I can't. I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING TO ME. <3 I connected to it and I laughed and I cried. And I know it's a bit slow? But I didn't care because I cherished every second with the boys. DEM RAVEN BOYS. \u2022 I am in love with 1 or 4 of them. \u2022 Okay not really, because Adam is still got too much baggage and he needs to nope. \u2022 BUT THE REST YES. AND ALSO BLUE I LOVE BLUE. I LOVE HER FAMILY. I LOVE CHAINSAW. I LOVE THE CAMERO. \u2022 ....And this review is no longer useful. I am aware. *fangirls aggressively for 2 more seconds* \u2022 OKAY I'M DONE. GO READ THIS THO. GO READ MY FAVOURITE BOOK OF EVER. ** UPDATE: My old review is here. It is awful. It is hilarious. But here never the less. I first read this in 2014. --> Old review. NO SPOILERS. I just wanted it condensed here for records. haha. (view spoiler) [I'm just going to accept this fact: If Maggie Stiefvater writes it, there's a 99.9% chance I'm going to ADORE THE SOCKS OFF IT. Naturally, The Raven Boys is no different. After putting this book off foreeeever, I've read it. I'm hopelessly in love. No one save me. The writing? This is why I LOVE everything Stiefvater. The writing is the stuff of perfect, writerly dreams. *hugs book* Seriously, it has the perfect amount of detail. It doesn't say \"box\" it says \"cereal box\". The car is an \"orange camaro\" and Ronan smells like \"soap and deodorant\". Just these little tiny things, that so often fall out of books. But there's ALWAYS here in Maggie Steifvater's books. I get so sucked in by her writing. Okay, I promised myself I would spend the whole review fangirling...but I seriously love her writing. The story? Okay, I confess! I originally read the first 2 chapters and then sent this back to the library. The writing is slow and sticky at the beginning. Like peanut butter, delicious, but your tongue gets gummed up. I found myself trying very hard to concentrate properly. Also the size scared the eyeballs out of me. Now I wish it hadn't ended. Dang it. Characters? I save best till last, you see. Oh gosh. I can't even begin to explain how much I adored these characters! There were a lot of them, but I never mixed any up! I just want to gather them all up and put them on my bookshelf for keeps. (I want to own this book.) Even though it's 3rd person, the writing was so intimate to each POV. I felt connected to them all. Very engaged with the story. I loved how Blue was strong, but in a quiet way! I think, too often, YA girls have to be kick-butt or weird or nothing. Blue was definitely weird. Wild child, style. But she was quiet and strong. I loved her way of thinking, how she was matter-of-fact, nervous at times. She wanted to impress but would refuse to stoop to impress. I loved how she and Gansey weren't an item! I assumed they would be. It is beyond AWESOME when the girl gets the secondary guy. The Raven Boys were equally amazing. I loved them all! Gansey is so motherly! I loved how he kept everyone together. The second one of their foursome was missing, they went looking. It was adorable. I can't possibly pick a favourite. I loved Ronan. He was all bad boy, teeth and conquer the world. Gansey was so well-meaning, even if he was condescending. And Adam! Yes, Adam was famously strict and hard working. Quiet, but in a determined way.

Honestly, I didn't even want to give another chance at what stayed for me the weakest book of the series : God, I was so scared to be disappointed. Not because of Blue's curse, as I never understood why people were annoyed with the \"romance\" here (understand : there's none worthy of attention PYNCH!! , definitely nothing going on between Blue and Gansey, and no will they/won't they vibes yet in my opinion), but because I found it so sloooow and all kinds of confusing (yes, I mean that it made me feel stupid. No, that is NOT a feeling I enjoy) Trust me : I am so very surprised at how much I loved it this second time. One word: FORESHADOWING All week I've been rereading these books and every one of them left a stunning impression on me because of how brilliantly Maggie Stiefvater crafted her plot . Indeed I can't even count how many times I stumbled upon a sentence and widened my fucking eyes before such talent and well, planning . I don't know about you, but in the past few years I've been too often appalled by how weak and nonsensical plots could get, especially in PNR. Really, did you look at my name? What do you think, that I chose \"frowner\" out of the blue? (haha) Elite , Inescapable , Hush, Hush , Alice in Zombieland - They all have a hand in this. Fuckers. Anyway - what I meant to say is this : no matter how confusing it can appear at first glance, it is NOT messy at all : everything has meaning, even if I didn't manage to understand it two years ago . Oh! And I should also tell you that I was OVERWHELMED by feels. I know, I know. How can the story's impact be more powerful the second time is beyond me. I mean, hello , I know all the twists. Go figure. Not to mention that all these Chainsaw feedings were fucking cute. OKAY?! Okay. RONAN'S THE BEST?! Ronan's the best. Now, is this review useful for you who never read it?

BUT - There is also baby Chainsaw, Ronan's kicking the hell out of ****, Just Gansey and... Oh WELL. I guess I'm a little OCD like that . Now that I saw how much I missed (*facepalm*/*headdesk*/ You stupid! ) in the others during my first read, I NEED to know if I'll live another epiphany. Or something.

I would be in the middle of the paragraph and think, \"how did I get here?\" Honestly, the writing and the pacing is why I knocked off 2 stars to this review. But first, let me talk about all the great things I loved about this book before I get into it. First off, the characters. These characters were so so so well-rounded and three dimensional, I never once felt like they were lacking in anything. More so, I just want to stand up and clap for how well developed the ADULTS were in this book. ADULTS IN A YA HAVE A PROMINENT ROLE?! What? No way. Yes way, and I loved how Blue's mother and her friends were so visual and so natural and whoa, took an actual active role in Blue's life. Aside from the adults, I loved the raven boys. Gansey, Ronan, Adam, and Noah were all so different and so distinctive. Sure, in the very very beginning I was a little confused at differentiating them, but once it was clear who who was, it was fine. Blue was also a great character. She wasn't outstanding by any means, but I am excited for her character development in the future books since her role in the supernatural was sort of just an introduction - I'm sure it will expand. Next, I enjoyed the multiple perspectives. I don't think I would have enjoyed this half as much as I did if we were just limited to Blue's perspective (considering she was just an ok character for me) but I loved how distinct Adam and Gansey's voices were. Again the perspective/voice thing plays into how much I enjoyed the characters and their developments. I'm guessing we will get Ronan's perspective next book based on a lot of things (which I'm stoked for because he was my favorite character) so I look forward to the exploration of other characters in the next book. Last thing I want to mention before I get into things I didn't enjoy was that I truly believe this is a superior book in the paranormal/supernatural YA genre. The lore behind the ley lines and what these kids are hunting is very very well thought out, researched, and developed (to an extent.) I've read so many YA paranormal books and while I still rated TRB a 3, I can recognize that it is better than most and appeals to a wide audience. Ok. So it's only appropriate to start with the beginning where I first experienced my \"drunk hangover\" with this book. I tried reading this book over the summer and didn't get past 20 pages before I put it down and forgot about it. I remembered being slightly confused but thought \"Hey, maybe I was just distracted when I first read it.\" No. I wasn't. Picking this book back up again, I stopped on page 7 and texted my friends who had read this book and was like \"So I'm on page 7 and I couldn't tell you anything of what I just read.\" It took me half of the book to really get used to the writing style. I'm not saying the writing was bad, because it wasn't. I'm just saying it was very oddly paced and constructed. There were times when I would be in the paragraph and I'd be like \"please please, don't make me be confused going to the next paragraph.\" Because goddamn, there were times going from paragraph to paragraph I would get confused and have to pause and: 1. Where am I? 2. I'm in my bed, good. 3. Wait, how did I get here? 4. What's going on? Eventually, the writing style \"clicked\" but holy moly, it took near forever. Not to mention the climax scene I often asked myself: 1. Where am I? 2. I'm in my bed, good. 3. Wait, how did I get here? 4. What's going on? I had to go to the Recaptian site after I finished to make sure I interpreted the ending like I thought I did. Geez, what work. And could I have gone back and re-read a few things? yeah, sure. But listen: I didn't want to. I also strongly felt like the first 150 pages were all set up and no plot. Sure, we knew Gansey's obsession with the ley lines, but really? That was it. I saw the first 150 pages as more of a \"day in the life\" of these characters versus an actual story line. It wasn't until Blue hooked up with the raven boys did the plot start showing and the story took off. But, personally, that was too long for me. There is a good chance that if I wasn't reading this for a readathon I wouldn't have finished this at all because it took SO long to get into the meat of the story. One thing I do want to be very specific about and this isn't a spoiler, but Adam shows interest romantically in Blue. While there is little to no actual romance in this book (which I know will change) I really couldn't see why Adam liked Blue. You know why I thought this? He literally says NOTHING of why he likes her in his perspective. Find me the receipts where he says why he likes/or is attracted to her that doesn't have to do with her physical looks and maybe then I will recant this, but I was so confused on why he likes her because he gives us absolutely no reasons. I didn't particularly like the setting either. There was just some spark of the essence of the south missing. I never felt like I was standing in Henrietta and with the story line tied so closely to landmarks, I expected a little bit more. Lastly, the ending was very abrupt, though I can't say I'm surprised because the whole book was abrupt. I know it was a cliffhanger. But it literally felt like I was walking and a brick wall came flying up in front of me and boom, stopped. That's how the book ended, which wasn't really for me. But hey, I am continuing with the series. Hopes for the next book: 1. I don't constantly feel like I'm in the middle of the worst hangover of my life while reading. 2. Ronan perspective 3. It doesn't take me half the book to become invested. ...more \u201cKeep being brave.\u201d Unique, eerie, compelling and magical. These are the attributes that perfectly describe The Raven Boys .

I do have a series to finish. The story in this book is the epitome of weeeeird . Strange and otherworldly. Original and enthralling nonetheless. I mean -- ley lines and Welsh hidden kings? Um, wut? First of all, what the hell are ley lines (I needed Google to educate me on that) and second of all, how is any of this interesting ? Initially, it was not. I couldn't care less about the plot because yeah, uneducated new age freshman right here. I was all about the characters because I suddenly couldn't stop reading about Blue and her overall awesomeness (more on that in a minute) and these 4 peculiar yet alluring raven boys. But then the plot somewhat became the characters themselves. I know, I know, I don't make sense but, personally, I felt this whimsical quest for Glendower become an integral part of each of them: Blue's subtle desire to be special, Gansey's blunt obsession, Adam's hope for a better future, Ronan's deepest secrets and Noah's tragic existence. It all made for an intricate spider web of characterization that in the end rendered this book as both character and plot driven. Ah, and speaking of that, these characters are GORGEOUS . I kid you not. I was feeling like I was in the presence of long-lost friends, effortlessly immersing myself into their world and dramas. Blue is undoubtedly amazing. I never felt this uniqueness about a female character ever since I acquainted with Karou and Zuzana from Daughter of Smoke and Bone . She's like a fairy, a pixie, but one with a strong and honorable personality. She's weird alright, but in an endearing way and I'm glad to see she brought a speck of color into the boys' lives. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested in telling other people\u2019s futures. She was interested in going out and finding her own.\u201d Adam Parrish is such a lovable character. You cannot but love him instantly, including his hard-work, grueling efforts, endurance, burdens, intelligence and overall sweetness. His integrity brought tears to my eyes and his selflessness was just another testament to show what a great guy he is. Plus his subtle romance with Blue is lovely. Gosh, everything about him is lovely. He's like a flower. Or a puppy. As I said, lovable to the nth degree. \u201cDon\u2019t throw compliments away, so long as they\u2019re free.\u2019\u201d His face was very earnest. \u201cThat one wasn\u2019t meant to cost you anything, Blue.\u201d The one who stole my heart though was Gansey . Richard 'Dick' Campbell Gansey III. This boy-king awed me with his drive and spark of brilliance, with his inquisitive mind and commanding leadership. He also made me love him because of his unknown na\u00efvet\u00e9 and innocence that was at odds with his old-money upbringing. He is still a boy, trapped in dreams of other realms, but his ambition alone might make those dreams a reality. And his friendships with the boys were incredible; he is the axis of the group, the alpha, but followed through love, respect and borderline adoration. It's mutual, however, and the fact that he struggles to keep them all together is nothing short of awesomeness. \u201cMy words are unerring tools of destruction, and I\u2019ve come unequipped with the ability to disarm them.\u201d Noah Czerny , you poor little creature. Even though he is always a bit in the background, I couldn't help than want to barge in Henrietta and give him a fierce hug. I hope to learn more about him, especially after all the twists and turns regarding his persona. Regardless, I already assigned him cinnamon roll status. However, without a doubt, the most peculiar of the boys is Ronan . He is also the most mysterious and he remains so throughout the novel. I loved his pissy and mercurial personality, which goes to show how messed up and broken he really is. Regardless, besides Gansey and Blue's family, he cracked me up as well. I'm hoping he'll get more page time and he'll become central once more, because I am dying to know about his father, his family, his dynamic with the boys and that hell of a jaw-dropping revelation at the end of the book. Considering the title and the cover of the 2nd book, it appears I'll get my wish. \u201cGansey had once told Adam that he was afraid most people didn\u2019t know how to handle Ronan. What he meant by this was that he was worried that one day someone would fall on Ronan and cut themselves.\u201d The innumerable women (okay okay, three) in Blue's life deserve a shoutout: Maura, Persephone and Calla. This trio right here made the book better, even if they're not in the light 24/7. As secondary characters, they were incredibly well developed, with distinct personalities and I loved each and every one of them, not to mention their lovely relationships with Blue. In a way, I felt that even though Blue is fatherless, she has 3 mothers. 3 really cool mothers. The boys as a group were a wonder, but throwing Blue into the mix achieved the ultimate perfection. She fit in naturally, not to mention her bizarre yet great family. I cannot wait to see them develop this little group of theirs. \u201cThey were always walking away from him. But he never seemed able to walk away from them.\u201d And ohmygod I just want to know how the story will pan out because that was such a tease to continuously plague us with bits from the future! The Gansey prophecy better not be happening. But what about Blue's faith to kill her true love with a kiss? The Gansey and Blue vision is so gut-wrenching I just can't even. And how will that come to fruition since we're only getting Adam and Blue vibes for now? A love triangle? Deaths (please not)?? I am equally scared and exhilarated to find out more. The prose is beautiful, but I didn't expect anything less from Maggie Stiefvater. I regret having forgotten the rest of the Mercy Falls series into an endless pile of TBR (note to self: bump them up). The third narrative was lovely manipulated to build up tension and shiver-inducing sequences, whereas the atmosphere was worthy of an Edgar Allen Poe inspiration: often bleak, cold, but enchanting. I read the book during nightly hours just to get the full experience and I gotta say it is the wowza kind. Also, do I hear ravens in the background? Oh, and thank you to the wonderful TRC fandom on Tumblr: your fan arts and edits made me cave in and read this book and I am not one bit regretting this decision. I can finally understand some references and not scroll past spoilery images yay! Now I'm off to read the sequel. Thank God I'm late to the party and do not have to experience the excruciating pain of waiting a year in between installments. I'LL DEVOUR THEM ALL. I can definitely say that The Raven Cycle series has the potential of becoming a new favorite of mine just by having read this first installment. It irreversibly won me over with its gothic nuances and just plain fun and sweet contemporary. If I have wrongly deemed myself the last person in the bookish community to not have read it and you're the rightful beholder of that title, than please go ahead and pick this up. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. \u201cIf you had a special knack for finding things, it meant you owed the world to look.\u201d ENJOY! <3 ...more I can't begin to tell you how much I loved this book. THE HYPE WAS REAL AND IT LIVED UP TO IT. The characters, plot, and writing were all phenomenal, and I'm so excited to read the rest of the series! Reread March 24-April 12th in preparation for THE RAVEN KING! This book is so wonderful on so many levels. I really loved listening to the audiobook this time around. I JUST LOVE BLUE AND THE BOYS AND THE PLOT AND THE WRITING AND EVERYTHING IS THE BEST. Slow burning. Mystical. Promising...ish.

(thanks for putting up with fangirling) In towns run by power, there are people who will seek it. When the abilities are supernatural, people will be drawn. Blue and her family of psychics live in Henrietta, a place known for it's ley lines and powerful supernatural frequencies. The Raven Boys have always meant trouble, but Gansey is seeking something more than the rest of his peers. Blue doesn't believe in true love, as she's been told all her life that she will be the death of them. That's until she meets Gansey, the first spirit she's ever seen on St. Mark's Eve. It could only mean two things, she killed him, or he's her true love. As she's drawn to this boy she's vowed not to love, Blue accompanies the Raven Boys on their quest to wake a mysterious King from his eternal sleep. Along with the other Aglionby boys, Ronan, Adam, and Noah, the four of them embark on a mission much bigger than all of them could imagine. As things fall into place and mysteries unveil, Blue and the Raven Boys must find a way to wake the king before someone else does. Once awaken, the king grants the individual a favour. In things that power lie, there will always be evil. Will they reach their goals before the latter? I'd like to start off by saying three stars is not a bad rating. It only means that it was an alright novel, only missing a few components. Characters: Blue: \u201cShe wasn't interested in telling other people's futures. She was interested in going out and finding her own.\u201d Gansey: \"Gansey knew he had to make a difference, had to make a bigger mark on the world because of the head start he'd been given, or he was the worst sort of person out there.\" \"The journal and Gansey were clearly long-acquainted, and he wanted her to know. This is me. The real me\" Ronan: \"In my head.\" Ronan's laugh was a sharp jackal cry. \"Dangerous place,\" commented Noah. Adam: \u201cAdam had once told Gansey, \"Rags to riches isn't a story anyone wants to hear until after it's done.\u201d Noah: *Insert quiet yet sly remark* Now onto the discussion of how I felt about this read. First of all, I'd like to list the things I enjoyed about it: Before I started this novel, I didn't pay much attention to the description. I indeed did not notice the \"you will kill your true love\" and the angst warning. If anything I'm glad I didn't . Though from the thesis, it may sound like a teenager trying not to fall in love, romance was probably one of the lesser aspects of it. This novel was purely just world and character building. There was some romance, but it was ever so light. At first I was annoyed with this \"you'll kill your true love\", \"that's your true love\", and \"don't kiss anyone\", routine. Once you get past the first couple of chapters, things start to ease off that topic a little more. The character and world building were beautiful. I was able to see inside each protagonist and feel a connection or emotion to them. The world building was difficult at first, as it is with any new series, but the author did well in introducing ideas without information dumps. We were taken on a entertaining adventure as we got to dive into the world, allowing us to feel excited as we got to know the settings. I can't say that none of the characters weren't complex. They all had many layers to them, neither were they attempted to be made \"perfect\" or sinister. Even with the villain, you were able to see their perspective. Though I wasn't found of the \"villain\", I felt bad for them. The entire \"true love\" complex was nicely done here. Unlike in other novels, where the label \"soul mates\" is just thrown around in excuse for lack of chemistry, it was not the case here. I was actually able to feel a connection between the two love interests(or at least future love interests). While reading TMI, I thought the entire \"Clary and Jace are soulmates\" talk was cute, but in this novel, I felt that the two interests were truly meant for each other. That may seem like a very short list of things I found likable, but the characters were a main part of it all. Now, to get into more of what my problems were: First of all, the writing . During the start of the novel, I highlighted and took notes of all the issues I was having with the writing. At some point I gave up and accepted that stammering sentences were a thing. \"Still, surely she could have guessed from the massive stone great hall and the parking lot full of cars that spoke German that it wasn't the sort of school that they could afford.\" Any other punctuation like additional commas, maybe cutting a part out? How about: \"From the massive stone great hall and the parking lot full of cars that spoke German, Blue knew that it wasn't the sort of school they could afford.\" Now doesn't that sound better? Then there was the constant name dropping. On one page I counted Blue's name mentioned eight times, all while this third person view was focused on Blue. Honestly the perspective switches in the first chapters of the book were overwhelming and confusing. I'd like to at least get used to one character before flying to another. Then again, I can't complain much since this novel was dedicated to character development. A lot of the mystery was taken out as we were taken into the \"villains\" perspective during the start of the book. I think it would of been a great plot twist if we were given hints that someone else was after waking Glendower as well. There were also times where I had to accept that things would be described as milkshakes: \"Pages and pages were browsing. Blue ran her fingers over the varied surface. Creamy, thick artist paper with a slender, elegant font. Thin, browning paper with spidery serif. Slick, utilitarian white stock with an artless modern type. Ragged-edged newspaper in a brittle shade of yellow.\" Is she reading the journal or making love to it? If you didn't finish reading that quote, I don't blame you. Pacing was a huge problem for me, as I found myself tired throughout. I reached 50% and only just got to see the group arranged. The entire premises may have been to build the world for us to understand better in future novels, but that isn't an excuse for the lack of action. Overall: I loved the characters and they're the main reason I'll continue on with this series. I'd love to see what the author will do with them, since I can already see things beginning to take place. If you liked this novel more than I did- or you didn't, you should check out Kainat's review of it here ...more The Raven Boys (RC 01) , by Maggie Stiefvater: 5 \u201cSo Far, So Great\u201d Stars \u201cBlue had developed two rules: One, stay away from boys, because they were trouble.

In fact, if the rest of the books are as good as the first, this series will make my all time favorites list. \u201cBlue, I don\u2019t have to tell you not to kiss anyone, right?\u201d ~ Maura Sargent. There are a ton of reviews for this book, so I\u2019ll skip the re-cap and cut to the chase. If you\u2019re a fan of Stephen King, you\u2019ll love The Raven Boys . The story is every bit as charismatic as *The Stand , with writing so rich and textured it rivals *The Talisman . Stiefvater's unique blend of symbolism and metaphor creates imagery so vibrant your heart will race in tandem with the characters. A situation made more atmospheric by clever dialogue, liberally laced with colorful colloquialisms, and subtle wit. While the narrative is Faulkneresque in it's complexity, not a single word is unnecessary, as every one moves the story forward. In short, it\u2019s a superb piece of writing. \u201cThere was something odd and complicated about these boys, Blue thought. Their lives were a web, and she had managed to get herself stuck in the very edge of it.\u201d ~ Blue Sargent. Blue, Gansey, Adam, Ronan, and Noah are wonderful in their complicated, oddness : guarded, yet vulnerable; lonely, yet never alone; eccentric, yet sensible. I fell in love with them immediately. Considering the depth of character they already posses, I can\u2019t wait to see who they become at the end of their adventures. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt. But in either three or seven minutes, Blue\u2019s raven boys are going to pull down the street and sit in front of the house while they try to find a way to convince her to sneak out with them.\u201d ~ Persephone Poldma. Blue\u2019s mother and her psychic roommates serve brilliantly as spiritual guides and comic relief. Their charming, quirkiness adds authenticity to the stories small town, southern setting. There is much more to be learned from and about these wonderful ladies and I anticipate the revealing will be humorous or cryptic; or, most likely, humorously cryptic. \u201cSome secrets only gave themselves up to those who\u2019d proven themselves worthy.\u201d ~ Richard Gansey III. WORTHY\u2026 And driven to remain awake until every last Raven Cycle book has been read. As the end of The Raven Boys has already left me too curious to sleep, I\u2019m ready and willing to accept the challenge. So, onward I go in pursuit of worthiness.

I came into this book not knowing anything about the plot, just that there were some weirdly named kids and something about ravens. It was a little difficult to get into as I had no idea where the plot would go and it was just overall pretty slow. However, halfway through it really picked up and surprised me! I will definitely be picking up the next book sometime in the near future. \u201cThere are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark\u2019s Eve, Blue. Either you\u2019re his true love or you killed him.\u201d In Blue's case it's both. Because fate is a bitch tricky little thing. I don't know how to put into words how much this book, this series, means to me. It's one of those stories that leaves you breathless. That leaves you wanting to unrepentantly commit the act of verbal diarrhea and a sway anyone with an ear to read this book.

Either you\u2019re his true love or you killed him.\u201d In Blue's case it's both. Because fate is a bitch tricky little thing. I don't know how to put into words how much this book, this series, means to me. It's one of those stories that leaves you breathless. That leaves you wanting to unrepentantly commit the act of verbal diarrhea and a sway anyone with an ear to read this book. But at the same it, it makes you want to hold it close to your heart and keep it a secret. To be selfish. \u201cHow much do you know about Welsh kings?\u201d I'll concede that reading The Raven Boys , and the other books for that matter, with fresh eyes will leave you with an aching hole in your heart. I mean, the damn feels this series has dredged up from my cold, heartless body is incredible. But it's nothing, NOTHING , like reading it the second time around. Because you know what's going to happen. I don't think I felt that sucker punch until I read this paragraph: Impossibly, Blue realized that this other Blue was crying because she loved Gansey. And that the reason Gansey touched her like that, his fingers so careful with her, was because he knew that her kiss could kill him. She could feel how badly the other Blue wanted to kiss him, even as she dreaded it. Though she couldn't understand why, her real, present day memories in the tree cavity were clouded with other false memories of their lips nearly touching, a life this other Blue had already lived. Why is it so powerful? Because I was there. I was the causal spectator watching these almost-touches and almost-kisses happen in future books. It's such a bittersweet feeling, to see the breadcrumbs laid out before you , and to know you were completely oblivious as you walked over them. And let me tell you, I was SO oblivious. I thought I understood what was happening. I KNEW NOTHING. How I wish I could say that to my past self. There were just so many things I missed, so many thing Maggie Stiefvater LEFT RIGHT IN MY FACE, begging for me to grasp, and I went by oblivious as a toddler. Gosh, I was so clueless. Ronan said, \u201cI\u2019m always straight.\u201d Adam replied, \u201cOh man, that\u2019s the biggest lie you\u2019ve ever told.\u201d WHAT THE FUCK WAS I DOING WHEN I READ THIS THE FIRST TIME. I mean, seriously? How did I not pick up on the double entendre. Clueless, I tell you, clueless! I'll never forget my first read of The Raven Boys and being thoroughly confused. I loved it, but without knowing exactly what I loved. I thought it was a little messy, the way the story was presented. As if I entered a conversation at its middle. And in a way, I did. Because now going back to the beginning, it's so clear to me how clever Maggie Stiefvater is. How purposeful and meaningful ever line, every word, is to the story. In The Raven Boys , you'll find a smattering of well thought out, original characters, a plot so unlike anything you've ever read, and a writing that combines a quotable seriousness and wit that leaves you enthralled. Last thoughts before moving on to The Dream Thieves : Blue , you're my girl crush and everything I want to be Gansey , you are my crush, period Ronan , you are my everything. . . also a crush Adam , most hate you but I love you Noah , you're A Beautiful Cinnamon Roll Too Good, Too Pure .::MY REVIEW FOR::. \u26ac The Dream Thieves (book 2) \u26ac Blue Lily, Lily Blue (book 3) \u26ac The Raven King (book 4) ((f.d: the visuals above were edited by myself-- base images were found on google)) ...more", "Title": "The Raven Boys"},
