I really really enjoyed it. Totally refreshing and surprising. I had no idea what to expect and I was very delighted with the end result. The voice and story remind me of Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and To Kill A Mockingbird. But I think this book made such a strong impression on me because it's about politics and language and the what it takes to organize regular people, yet it's all done through the lens of middle school/ elementary school (the book is also similar to Animal Farm). I've recommended it to several people but I've found that most people are thrown off by the title; so unfortunately this book may have a hard time gaining recognition for that fact alone. For anyone who likes reading YA or tween fiction however, I would definitely recommend this book. And for anyone who is interested in politics or rhetoric, i would definitely recommend it also. great Winter read. ...more I haven't read a book this funny or as subtly subversive in a long time.<---A>Chuck U.
