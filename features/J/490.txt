In this sequel, we get to experience Gabriel and Julia's relationship in a much deeper level. The book picked up where Gabriel's Inferno left off. Everything seemed perfect when it comes to Gabriel and Julia's relationship but unexpected situations suddenly came out which led their relationship to a different, painful direction. First of all, I have to say that I knew it! I knew what was about to come so it didn't surprise me when it finally happened. I was so scared of the consequences that these two will be facing when I was still reading the first book so I can say that I'm already prepared for it. What surprised me most was the pain that it caused. What happened to Julia and Gabriel was too heart-breaking. But you know the good thing about this book? It ended beautifully that I was so glad to leave it when I turned the last page. I actually wished that it was the ending for the whole series. Another thing that I loved about this book was the way Gabriel continued to treat Julia gently despite what happened to them. Julia,<---M> on the hand</---M>, also had a notable character development. She was able to handle things differently here and for that, I adored her. I loved Gabriel's Rapture as a whole. It's one of the well-written sequels I've ever read because of the way it was delivered. I'm excited to find out how the series will conclude in the third book! \"She is not my equal. She is my better.

I waited for its release for months and let me tell you I was not one bit disappointed by it. I could write pages just on my favorite quotes; the writing is superb and extremely sexy without having to be erotic! The book starts out the morning after their first love-making experience in Italy that occurred at the end of Gabriel\u2019s Inferno. I loved that I did not miss a moment of their lives and was able to read about the growth of their relationship. They spend some time dealing with their pasts, Julia the shy one who had a difficult childhood and Gabriel the sexually promiscuous one who had been adopted by a family that he didn\u2019t quite think he deserved. I saw flashes of Julia gaining control of her own life and not letting others walk all over her. Gabriel was learning to love but still had issues letting Julia make some of the decisions in their relationship. I love the way that Gabriel loves Julia. He is so protective, kind and provides her with endless pleasure. He begins to learn to deal with his feelings without turning to sex which had become his addiction after drugs, a coping mechanism really. Now Gabriel did make my blood boil a time or two when he tried to make some major decisions in their relationship without consulting Julia. I understand why he did it but big decisions should always be made together, especially in matters of the heart. There was a portion of the book where Gabriel essentially became like Julia in the Gabriel\u2019s Inferno and Julia became more like Gabriel as far a sexual need goes. While it was ironic, it showed how both characters had grown over the course of their relationship. There will be those that are trying to pull them apart and don\u2019t forget, their relationship in Gabriel\u2019s Inferno started when Gabriel was the professor and Julia the student. Would the force of these things be strong enough to tear them apart? Is their love strong enough to get through the storm? Will Julia be his Beatrice forever? The book was as intense as the first but far more romantic. The writing is brilliant and I could feel what the characters were feeling in my heart. I don\u2019t think that the book could have had a better ending (I know some people will want a third book but for me the series ended perfectly!). ...more 4.5 - I liked Julia much better this time around. :) My Julia and Gabriel: Wow, <---A>Sylvain Reynard</---A> did not disappoint! This sequel is at least as good as Gabriel's Inferno . The book is full of thoughtful ideas about life, sin, forgiveness and love. In Gabriel's Rapture, the author connected love and sex in most beautiful way and the way he sees marriage is absolutely wonderful. The book has a very substantial effect on me. It made me cry and it made me think a lot about the life. I don't remember feeling such a strong compassion for main characters as My Julia and Gabriel: Wow, Sylvain Reynard did not disappoint!

I really admire Sylvain Reynard for his ability of forming such a beautiful compliments in this book. Moreover, he is a master of teasing and all of the sex scenes were so real and so tasteful. Some of the compliments said by Professor to Julia, made even me blushed when reading it :) \"You must have been designed and not merely made\" The author succeeded again in creating realistic characters. Gabriel and Julia are not perfect, and they both made various mistakes in this book. But this is how life goes, how we learn. Gabriel has changed a lot comparing to Gabriel's Inferno and I was so happy to read that he was able to find his peace finally. This book about love and forgiveness touched my heart and I am sure I will re-read it couple of times. SR, thanks a lot for enable us to read such a wonderful story!

God, you can feel how dedicated he was in every aspect of this book, from the plot, to the characters and other details that surrounded it. I can only imagine the hard work and research put into writing this book, because not one word is there unnecessary and without meaning. \"Gabriel's Rapture\" is the second installment of this great trilogy. Here we find our beloved Gabriel already exploring his relationship with Julia, his younger lover. After the happenings in book 1, they accepted their feelings from one another and are madly in love. Their connection is intense and passionate. I enjoyed the attention that the writer had on building this special relationship between Gabriel and Julia. From my point of view it is one of the most beautiful love stories ever, because the humanity of its heroes. They are not perfect, they made made mistakes, but they love passionately and with such intensity that makes you able to feel it in every page of the story. They complete each other, make each other better and dream for a future together, despite having so much against them. Being different made them special and brought them together, as in light and dark, making up one unique love story. \" You are teaching me to love, and I suppose I\u2019m teaching you to love too, in a way. We aren\u2019t perfect, but we can have happiness. Can\u2019t we?\" I love Gabriel and I believe that no matter how many books I read this book, he ruined me for future book boyfriends. He is the definition of complexity and I enjoyed this second installment because here I could see another side of him, the protector. Now, when Julia's future is being threatened, he is willing to do everything to not let it happen. The puts her first, having to face suffering and lost because he can't bring her pain. I love him so much for this, and my admiration for him kept on growing. Although he is very stubborn sometimes, you can't seem to not like him, always finding ways of justifying his actions. Julia is the one who makes him feel alive and worthy of love, despite the past that he had. This element of finding peace is still kept in the second book, because Gabriel tries so hard to make her happy and proud of being his lover. He searches for redemption in Julia's arms and his efforts are truly admirable. \" I\u2019m no miracle worker. But I love you.\" \"There was a time when I could have been led astray. But that was before I found you. I would rather spend the rest of my life drinking your love, then emptying all the oceans of the world.\" I loved the way their relationship is accentuated in all its features, beginning with the sexual connection and ending with the deep feelings they have for each other. Gabriel talks about loving as a whole, loving completely and giving in in all its aspects. Sexual satisfaction can be considered lust, but love is more complex, and enraptures more feelings and sensations. \"I can tell that I please your body. But your body is not your mind, or your heart.\" He takes care of her as a whole, body and soul, and this side of him is amazingly featured in the book. Julia on the other hand goes trough a lot before finding her happiness with Gabriel. But these events made her grow as a women. I liked this strong side of her, the way she fights for what she wants, but also the way she let's go, trying to do the best thing for her and for Gabriel. Her loyalty to him is fierce and I admired her for her strength to move on. She begins with being a sweet young girl, to a women having to fight for her happiness and for the things she cares. She also has the dignity of moving on, even though her heart is telling her she can't. If in the first book we witness the development of their relationship, in this one we get to see how they managed being apart, having to trust one another and in the end seek forgiveness for the mistakes they both did. I truly recommend this book and others from Sylvain Reynard because he is amazing and has one of the best writing styles ever. 5 stars!!

A union between two dissimilars into a seamless one. Julianne and Gabriel are together at last. Holidaying in Italy, Gabriel is lovingly guiding Julianne into the pleasures and intimacies of a sexual relationship. She proves an apt student. But with their return to the university, both Gabriel and Julianne are caught up in the administration's investigations into misconduct and inappropriate behaviour between staff and students. One of the strengths of both Gabriel's Inferno and Gabriel's Rapture is the many references to food, wine, languages, art, architecture, music, literature and the knowledge of the local shops and eateries of the great cities of the world. Even fashion - and surprisingly women's fashion - does not escape the notice of author Sylvain Reynard. Having read quite a few romance novels by many different authors across most of the sub-genres of romance, I have never come across any author who is so well-versed in the fine arts, with such a comprehensive knowledge of literature. The 12th century love story of Abelard and Heloise for example, is not commonly known I think, but it was cleverly written into this story and parallels in many respects Gabriel and Julianne's own love story. This book also focuses on Gabriel's introspection, his quest for forgiveness and redemption. Not only emotionally and psychologically, but spiritually. Where the conflict in Gabriel's Inferno was mostly played out between Gabriel and Julianne, this time the conflict comes from a number of external sources. Their love is established, yet still faces obstacles. Gabriel's generosity and his gentleness towards Julianne is demonstrated in a number of ways. The love scenes though not steamy, are sensual and romantic. Despite my enjoyment of Gabriel's Rapture there are a few complaints. Julianne is very teary and at times immature for a twenty-three year-old. This may be the author's way of demonstrating her innocent nature, but it does sometimes grate. Gabriel is overly-protective, almost cloying and treating her as if she too fragile and precious. There were also some unanswered questions about the final outcomes for Christa and Paul. Finally, just a word about the author. In my opinion, very few male authors can write romance well. This is not a sexist remark, but a personal observation after reading many romances. I can count on one hand the number of romance novels by male authors that I have enjoyed. Both Mr Reynard's novels are in that number. Perhaps other male romance authors simply don't write to my taste in novels. Whatever the reason, I have been mostly disappointed in romances written by men. I have no idea if Mr Reynard is as urbane, intelligent, educated and worldly as Prof Emerson, but he certainly comes across this way in his writing. I'm a little bit awestruck at a man who knows the story of Abelard and Heloise, who knows about a certain dress worn by the late Grace Kelly in the 50s, a Bordelle chemise, a Michael Kors bag, and most importantly that no civilised person would drink coffee with milk after breakfast. After reading Gabriel's Inferno , I was convinced author Sylvain Reynard was actually Ms Reynard, and mentioned this on a number of occasions to friends. Surely no mere male could write a romance so well and convey such depth of emotion that (at least in my experience) seems to be the preserve of female authors. I\u2019m still finding it difficult to believe that Sylvain Reynard is a bloke. But take that as a compliment, Mr Reynard. Steam: 2.5 ...more Buddy read with Maru Gave up at the 30% mark.

Gabriel really is a big A-hole, never thought I'd say this but he's too much of a douche-bag! I have a very high tolerance of BS and drama but this book just has too much of it. Julia is behaves herself like a very nice doormat: stays there and takes it all. The straw that broke the camel's back was her ability to forgive EVERYTHING! This woman hasn't found no unforgivable thing in anything that Gabriel has done (view spoiler) [not even when she found out that he kept banging the crazy lady who had been pregnant wish his kid! I mean that was even lower then low! (hide spoiler) ] . All in all he was a cold A-hole and she was a Mary Sue heroine taken to the extreme. Some of my notes(they are mostly very mean and for the first 15% or so) aka ranting: -\"The blue sky blushed to see such passionate lovemaking, while the Florentine sun smiled down, warming the lovers despite the gentle breeze. Beside them, Julia\u2019s coffee and milk grew stone cold and sullen at being ignored.\" oh come on!!! -this shoe fetish is getting out of hand, I wonder if Julia caught it... -some of the word choices are too much! Jane Austen had nothing on this author! -the only character where I don't find his jealousy hot(I hope it's the 1st and last time) The only thing that I enjoyed in this series(2 books) were the pop culture references, those were great.

I decided to re-read both books in preparation for reading the recently released final book, Gabriel's Redemption ... Because this work wasn't completely irredeemable, let's start with the things I enjoyed: - It is a story filled with LOVE and angst... I do get the warm fuzzys from Gabriel when he isn't being an asshole. - The writing is still marvelous; Sylvain Reynard presents a completely original writing style for modern Romance. - The narrator has a quirky sense of humor which prevents the entire work from being unbearably pretentious. I usually include this at the end of my reviews, but since I'm talking about the good things about this book, I's like to go ahead at tell you: Some of My Favorite Moments: (view spoiler) [ \u201cFor me, your name is synonymous with orgasm.

St. Thomas Aquinas would have had to add you as his Sixth Way if he\u2019d ever been blessed enough to see you.

Like she was the only woman in the room, in the world, the only woman ever. Like she was Eve. \u201cI love you. Madly.\u201d Something about the way her voice sounded in his ear made his heart quicken. \u201cI love you too. I love you far too much, I\u2019m sure. But I don\u2019t know how to love you any other way.\u201d His final words were a whisper, but they burned in the air. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to love you any other way, either,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cThen God have mercy on us both.\u201d It would be safer, easier, to choose Paul. Her heart would heal with him. But in choosing Paul, she would be settling for the good and not the exceptional. And even if the exceptional eluded her for the rest of her life, it would be better, she thought, to live the life of a Katherine Picton, than to be like her mother. In marrying a good man without loving him passionately and completely, she would only serve to short-change him and herself. And she was not that selfish. Gabriel\u2019s eyes watered at the sound of her vulnerability and her courage. If he ever had a moment\u2019s doubt that he would love and admire her forever, no matter whether she chose him or not, that doubt faded away like a wisp of smoke. Julia wondered if such astronomical ass-like levels were humanly possible.

Enjoy! WHEN I PICKED UP BOOK TWO I WAS THINKING: BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THIS BOOK WAS GOING OFF THE RAILS... THE BOOK SOMEHOW MORPHED INTO A SERMON. HEAVY HANDED, RELENTLESS, EXASPERATING... THE INCLUSION OF LITERARY REFERENCES IN THE FIRST BOOK WAS ENDEARING, IT PRESENTED A GREAT PARALLEL. HOWEVER, IN BOOK TWO THE USE OF RELIGIOUS ALLEGORY BECAME OVERWHELMING... THE AUTHOR FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT HIS READERS ARE INTELLIGENT. THERE WAS NO REASON TO BEAT THE THEMES OF REPENTANCE, REDEMPTION, SACRIFICE, AND LOVE INTO US! THIS IS NOT HOW YOU IMPART INFORMATION: LESS IS MORE. WE UNDERSTOOD IT THE FIRST TIME, AND SUFFERED THROUGH IT FROM THEN ON. IT'S CONDESCENDING TO ASSUME THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE SO MUCH TIME TO PRESENT THESE THEMES... OR THAT YOU NEED TO CONSTANTLY REPEAT THEM...

Of course, I loved this type of drama even though I felt bad for Julia. I'm glad that she \"womaned\" up and took care of things! I wanted more angst and drama though...or at least for it to on longer . But I did love how Gabriel handled things as usual. He thinks of everything! The book ends really well and just makes me wonder what could happen that could warrant another book? And the title freaks me out a little...what is his redemption? I'm just hoping it's an overall thing and not something more specific. Favorite quote: \u2665 \"I would never have pegged you as a cuddler, Professor Emerson.\" ...more \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 !

I don\u00b4t think I have re-read any book that many times. And every time, they get better. Crazy, I tell you. For me, Sylvian Reynord is nothing short of a genius. Embarrassing maybe, but true. And I love him for having writen these books.\"Gabriel\u00b4s Rapture\" is one of the best sequels I have read. Ever. \"Gabriel\u00b4s Inferno\" was perfect and so was this book. I loved it so much. Every syllable, every sentence, every page. The heroine in books can either crash it or save it. Julia definitly did not crash it. Together with Professor Emerson, Julia is one of my favorite characters ever. Gabriel is more sexy then ever in this book. The Professor gets an A in the art of seduction.. This book is so brilliant on so many levels. It is smartly written, in a poetic kind of way. Since it is written in third person, it allows us to get many persons thoughts and reasons. The book not only focuses on the sexy, charasmatic Professor and his former student. It gives us a overview on events that is important for the story, it is refreshing and preferable not to only read one persons POV. Sylvain Reynard has really written an EXCELLENT book without any flaws. I cannot wait to read more about Julianne and Gabriel and their relationship in book 3. I was a bit sad to see the changes Sylvain had made in the book, compered to the online version. But these two books have been idel. Simply perfection. This is one of the best books I have ever read. Sylvain Reynard is one of my absolute favorite authors of all time! ...more (Warning: Spoilers ahead!)

It takes the superb groundwork set in the first book, \u201cGabriel\u2019s Inferno,\u201d and builds upon it to give the reader a rich and rewarding continuation of Gabriel and Julia\u2019s story. We meet up with the couple where we left them at the end of \u201cGabriel\u2019s Inferno:\u201d in Florence, where they\u2019ve deepened their passionate affair while immersing themselves in all this cultured city has to offer. Sylvain Reynard draws us into the beauty of Italy and makes us feel as if we\u2019re experiencing everything along with Gabriel and Julia. Glorious artwork, most of which is housed in the Uffizi museum, is highlighted. A number of musical selections provide a lovely accompaniment to the couple\u2019s tender moments. There are romantic dinners, and even more romantic and erotic tangos in museums and their hotel room. The reader sees and feels these perfect touches, and it\u2019s another testament to Reynard\u2019s writing that it\u2019s a sensual experience for us, too. When Gabriel and Julia have intimate moments in Florence or Umbria, readers feel as if we are right there with them, and it makes us wish all the more that we could be. Even as we\u2019re enjoying this sojourn in one of the loveliest countries in the world, we get the sense that it can\u2019t last. Vacations never do, right? Neither does that heady sensation that comes when you find your other half and love them body and soul for the first time. Surely enough, shortly after Gabriel and Julia return to Toronto and their daily lives, they find that reality has intruded in the form of a complaint that threatens to reveal their love affair, which is prohibited by University of Toronto policies that forbid fraternization between teachers and students. As the investigation into their relationship grows more serious, it becomes apparent that Julia\u2019s career will be short-circuited before it even starts. In order to spare her, Gabriel sacrifices himself at the altar of academic bureaucracy, but the ultimate penalty is that it means the end of their relationship. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see the bitter turn of events, particularly since we know both Julia and Gabriel bear responsibility for what happened, though Gabriel seems to shoulder more guilt. (As the professor and academic mentor, and certainly the more experienced of the couple, he\u2019s probably right to do so.) After so many struggles to acknowledge their love for each other \u2013 so many misfires and miscommunications, so much anger and fear over their separate pasts \u2013 they finally fulfilled the destiny ordained by their night in the orchard so many years ago, only to have it denied by the very institution that, ironically, reunited them. And yet...and yet...I came away realizing that if they hadn\u2019t gone through this separation, they may not have survived as a couple despite their great love. They were better off because they grew individually and were forced to mature emotionally on their own. The heartbreak they endured gave them a better respect for what they had and almost lost. It\u2019s an astonishing thing to see because as you\u2019re reading it, you realize how rare it is. They acknowledge that the first rush of love, while real, couldn\u2019t be sustained because they\u2019d pinned too many of their dreams on it. And in the process, they\u2019d idealized each other in a way that also couldn\u2019t be maintained, and ultimately, could have undermined the strength of their genuine bond if the University hadn\u2019t interfered. In a way, they owe Toronto a debt of gratitude for it. Julia is understandably devastated by the separation. Having been so careful to trust Gabriel, she feels as if she\u2019s been duped and begins to doubt that he ever loved her. She tries to reach him but the only communication is a brief e-mail from Gabriel that bluntly tells her to stop. She even goes to his condo and finds that everything is gone, except for the clothes that he\u2019d bought for her just months ago, when their feelings for each other still lay just under the surface of their skin. It\u2019s especially heartbreaking to watch Julia\u2019s efforts to complete her Master\u2019s degree in Dante studies, a subject that\u2019s an emotional minefield considering that it reunited her with Gabriel. But she perseveres and even thrives under the supportive friendship of Paul and the firm, guiding hand of her advisor, Katherine Picton. Gabriel embarks on a journey he hoped he would never have to take; one where he\u2019s alone, without Julia. Before their relationship, Gabriel lived an empty, dissatisfied existence \u2013 one with professional fulfillment but without hope of finding the love and grace he truly craved. He\u2019s forced back into that existence now that he and Julia parted, and it\u2019s especially cruel for Gabriel. Having finally known true joy and unselfish love, he feels the loss all the more bitterly. Reynard skillfully draws a picture of a man again skating along the edge of his own destruction, driven to despair by the loss of a woman who inspired the redemption he believed was always out of reach. But just as we worry that Gabriel\u2019s old vices will again draw him under, we see that the virtues learned in his time with Julia have had a lasting effect. He returns to Italy, at first to mourn, but then to find faith and grace in his circumstances. We also see another facet of the Professor\u2019s genius as we gradually realize he\u2019d planned a way out of their situation that would help both of them. But the real victory \u2013 the real uplifting part of this story \u2013 is Julia\u2019s newfound strength. She mourns, too, but is determined to forge ahead with the life\u2019s work she\u2019s chosen for herself and her studies. A romantic alternative is offered to her, but Julia knows it would be unfair to both of them for her to settle when it comes to love. Even when Gabriel returns, she doesn\u2019t accept him easily. She\u2019s wary, careful; though her heart is sure he\u2019s its ultimate destination, she has now seen too much to fall back into old patterns. On the one hand, it\u2019s almost humorous that she makes him work so hard for it, but on the other, it makes perfect sense, and it\u2019s brilliant. Julia comes out of adversity and heartbreak a smarter, stronger woman. And she knows what\u2019s at stake. If she and Gabriel are to truly flourish together, they need to confront their weaknesses and the issues that they tend to repress. I came away from this book loving Julia almost as much as Gabriel does. At the end of the story, I thought of one of my favorite quotes, from \u201cZoo Story\u201d by Edward Albee: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s necessary to go a long distance out of the way in order to come back a short distance correctly.\u201d Julia and Gabriel were forced away from each other, but they were smart enough to appreciate the lessons learned from the experience. They loved each other enough to allow it, and they put those lessons to good use once they returned to each other. There are literary and artistic references within the sequel, as there are in \u201cGabriel\u2019s Inferno.\u201d I found these genuinely enhanced my reading experience, as they often sparked an interest in finding out more about a painting or in reading a book I hadn\u2019t considered before. One last thought: Gabriel\u2019s Rapture is again told through the eyes of the Snarky Narrator. His wry humor and asides are a welcome part of the series. I\u2019m really fond of him, and I\u2019ve come to think of him as the couple\u2019s guardian angel. Even though he\u2019s as pointed and sarcastic as ever, you sense that he wants the best for Gabriel and Julia. ...more Shall I stay?

Much of the book was unbelievable, and I love to read fantasy/paranormal so that says a lot. There has to be some suspension of disbelief when reading books, but this book asked for far too much. If the two main characters were real, I would have to slap them up side the head and tell them to get over their selves. Seriously, you would have to be a deluded romantic to sollow this story, no offense meant to those who liked it :). The author should of just stopped at the first book and we could have assumed that they got away with carrying out their romance and lived happily ever after.

Gabriel's Inferno intertwined Julia and Gabriel's past with their present, but Gabriel's Rapture took things a step further and intertwined Julia and Gabriel's past, present, and future. Gabriel's Rapture picks up right where Gabriel's Inferno left off. Julia and Gabriel are in Italy, enjoying their freedom and each other. Once they return from Italy, however, they have to face reality and forces that are threatening to pull them apart. In this novel, Julia and Gabriel are both committed to one another, but they must face their pasts and overcome new, present hurdles in order to have a lasting future. Julia and Gabriel are intelligent and witty characters. Their passion for art and literature and their all-consuming love for one another create a spellbinding love story. I highly recommend this artistic, sensual love story. I gave Gabriel's Rapture (Gabriel's Inferno #2) by Sylvain Reynard 4 STARS (4.5 STARS). I rated Gabriel's Inferno (Gabriel's Inferno #1) by Sylvain Reynard 5 STARS. Don't let my lower rating fool you. Gabriel's Rapture was sensational. It's, without a doubt, a MUST READ. The only reason I rated this novel lower than its predecessor was because I missed Gabriel's sexy bad boy side. What can I say? I am a sucker for bad boys! Reading this series has been \"a beautiful, powerful and addicting journey\". I strongly encourage adults to read Gabriel's Inferno and Gabriel's Rapture. They are two of my favorite books, and I look forward to re-reading them both many times in the future. -XOXO READING, EATING AND DREAMING ...more Quick review: Cover: Still Cute Rating: NC-17 Steaminess Scorching Thumbs Up: 5 Overall: Better than the first by far.

With that said, I had severely high expectations on the sequel and maybe that's why I didn\u2019t love this sequel as much as I expected to. I liked it, but didn\u2019t love it. The obvious positive in this sequel is that we get to witness Gabriel and Julia\u2019s new found love. Without a doubt, these two are madly in love. Their time in Italy was beautiful and extremely romantic. We get to see the saucier side of their relationship and, yes, it was emgasmic . However, because of this, the story\u2019s tone was different from the first. The Professor\u2019s commanding presence was sorely missed in this sequel. He grew up, and grew up fast. His new relationship with Julia has definitely changed him. Most of it was for the better, but his brooding attitude was severely missed. In regards to Julia, her character was still on the shy side, but did start to develop a voice of her own. It took awhile for it to happen and it did get a little frustrating. In addition to the changes in the main characters, the other thing that bothered me about the story was the multitude of people wanting to break them up. We have Paulina, Natalie, the Dean and the various other academic professionals involved in the investigation. I had such a difficult time when it came to the investigation part. I was angry and heartbroken. Though Gabriel and Julia have their HEA, I don\u2019t think I fully recovered from that part. It was just too much. Oh, and as a side note, I really felt for Paul\u2019s character. I\u2019m a sucker for the brokenhearted bloke. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m happy Gabriel & Julia got together, but I hated that Paul was collateral damage. He was such a sweetheart and I just adored his character. I\u2019d like to think that he, too, has his HEA. Overall, I want to thank you, Mr. Reynard, for writing this sequel and letting us share their happiness. You seem to have the natural talent to invoke a lot of deep emotion in your stories. I love your writing and I highly look forward many more of your stories :) ...more A BEAUTIFUL SENSUAL LOVE STORY....

As I said in its review , the book was promising at the beginning. I kind of enjoyed the way the author build the story based on a very significant piece of world's literature, and was fascinated by the thorough research done by the author. But unfortunately, that's about all the positive stuff I can say about the book. So, the story in Gabriel's Rapture picks up right wher \"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate!\" I want to start this review by saying a couple of things about Gabriel's Inferno .

But unfortunately, that's about all the positive stuff I can say about the book. So, the story in Gabriel's Rapture picks up right where Gabriel's Inferno ended. After a whole book of tormented love in the dark, Gabriel and Julia are finally together together and have done the dirty. The beginning of the book is complete waste of space and had me constantly rolling my eyes. Please, behold: \"The blue sky blushed to see such passionate lovemaking, while the Florentine sun smiled down, warming the lovers despite the gentle breeze. Beside them, Julia's coffee and milk grew stone cold and sullen at being ignored.\" Who writes like that? And more importantly, who likes such writing? I dont know what you call that, but I call it lazy-ass writing. Further on, right after encountering this absolute treasure of literary writing, we find a terrible inconsistency: \"And it isn't my bedroom, it's our bedroom.\" Authors probably think that similar statements make women's panties drop instantly, but I personally find them very irritating. Especially when nothing on the matter has been said previously. I actually re-read this part of the dialogue a couple of times, just to make sure that Julia hasn't specifically said anything about his/hers/their bedroom. And she hadn't. So, when things like that just pop up in the middle of nowhere, I start seriously thinking whether I should continue reading a book. And to make things even worse, Gabriel and Julia attend this event where Gabriel is giving a lecture about Botichelli's art and how he represents different female archetypes in his works (I guess Gabriel is a specialist in all things Italian). Gabriel is practically confessing his love for his girlfriend before the eyes of the highest of the highest in the art and literary world (it's still unclear to me why he keeps referring to her as his fianc\u00e9e, but that's probably because of my underdeveloped brain or something; there is actually some conversation on the matter later on), and actually compares Julia to Beatrice (I bet you didn't see this one coming), Venus, Eve and Mary (yes, Eve as in Adam and Eve, and Mary as in the mother of baby Jesus). So I say, let's give it up for Julia, goddess of all earthly and heavenly beauty and virtue. I used to think that Gabriel is a pretentious prick and I almost hated him about it. But now that I started this book: \"Only barbarians drink coffee with milk after breakfast. Haven't you ever been to Italy? And by the way, Miss Peterson, skim milk is for wankers. Or fat girls.\" Bitch, there is absolutely no doubt that I hate you now. And, as if pompous dick Gabriel is not enough for us, we are supposed to go through a narration so dull, if my brain had a heart, it would need defibrillation: \"He ended his email with an explicit and detailed suggestion of a prospective sexual rendezvous, possibly in the late spring. Then he finished his cigarette in the darkness and joined his wife in their matrimonial bed.\" What? I ask again: What? Dear readers, I made it all the way to the 13% and the end of chapter 4. My brain refuses to let my eyes read this shit and this goes straight to my will-never-finish list. I tried, God knows I did, but some things are more powerful than I am. I will not be rating this because I usually rate unfinished books after I've at least reached the middle, but I guess it's pretty obvious what my rating would be. ...more I'm so sorry to have to do this, but this one was a letdown. There isn't much I can go into without spoiling things for others, but I can tell you that one of the biggest issues with it is the terrible story-arc. The climax of the book is in the middle, which means you spend the whole second half waiting for something to happen... and it never does. Even worse is the fact that this book spends most of its time back-stepping everything that was accomplished in the first.

The climax of the book is in the middle, which means you spend the whole second half waiting for something to happen... and it never does. Even worse is the fact that this book spends most of its time back-stepping everything that was accomplished in the first. The first book ends with the idea of redemption and the relief of revealing your soul to the one you love, and how wonderful it is to love someone openly with no secrets--only to come to this book witch opens right where the other left off, and we come to find that half of the 'soul bearing' elements that took place at the end of book one were lies and half-truths. So not only is this book disappointing, but it ruins all the special scenes from the previous one as well. Also, just a note, and this in is no way the fault of the author - my Nook edition had an entire page missing, so e-book readers beware. I am truly sorry, and I hope I did not come across as offensive to anyone, and do remember that this is only my opinion. I will continue to read this author as there is a lot of positives about the writing itself, but sadly, for the sake of the first book, this one would have been better left unwritten. ...more<---C>Sylvain Reynard</---C>", "Title": "Gabriel's Rapture"},
