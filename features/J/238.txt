She is worth more to me than all of the precious jewels!* /Suck up \"The series gets good at book three.\" If I had a penny for every time I heard something like this about a series then... okay, I'd probably have about a dollar now. But still, for many avid readers out there, it is the bane of their existence.<---F> No, but really</---F>. This series gets GOOD at book three. Unlike most people though, I didn't mind it at book one. I thought it had a lot of potential. Some people get thrown off of being tossed into an unfamiliar world with little or no hand-holding from the author. Note: <---A>Ilona Andrews</---A> will never hold your hand. You either keep up or she'll leave you behind. For me the second book was an improvement but still only representative of a slightly better-than-average series. Then the third book happened. It really, really happened... Ever since then, I've been in love with <---C>Kate Daniels</---C>, Ilona Andrews, and her Edge series. <+++>Magic Slays</+++> lives up to the series fairly well. It's intelligent, witty, well-paced, fun, easy to read and enjoyable. The character arcs are all interesting, realistic, involving and enjoyable. My only complaint with this series is that Andrews is obviously very uncomfortable about any intimate scenes. She has the writer's equivalent of premature ejaculation and at one point I almost wanted to stroke the book and mutter, \"It's okay. Really. It is. It happens to everyone.\" Andrews, like Neil and unlike most of the Urban Fantasy authors, actually seems to LIKE women. The friendship between Kate and Andrea, her ward Julie and her dealings with the other women in this book is so well treated! It's a breath of fresh air to have a female protagonist who actually gets along with other women. Over all, if you're a fan of this series, definitely read the latest installment. If you're not a fan of this series - please don't shoot me but... It gets good at book three. ...more \u201cPut your badass faces on and follow me.\u201d Stu dying Intellectual Property Law or following Kate Daniels' new adventures that include slavic gods,domestic terrorists and my favorite knight in furry armor .Let me think. \u201cStarting the day with a philosophical debate with a priest of the Embodiment of All Evil.It could only go downhill from here.\u201d Kate Daniels is now the Beast Lord's mate and she has her own business that investigates paranormal problems and life would be perfect,if only someon \u201cPut your badass faces on and follow me.\u201d Stu dying Intellectual Property Law or following Kate Daniels' new adventures that include slavic gods,domestic terrorists and my favorite knight in furry armor .Let me think. \u201cStarting the day with a philosophical debate with a priest of the Embodiment of All Evil.It could only go downhill from here.\u201d Kate Daniels is now the Beast Lord's mate and she has her own business that investigates paranormal problems and life would be perfect,if only someone hired her.And her ward stopped escaping from her private school.And she wasn't afraid that her father would finally come to kill her.And a device of disastrous potential that threatened Atlanta's citizens was found.And an underground organisation didn't try to murder her.A humble mercenary's life is never perfect after all. Confessions of a Kate Daniels addict 1.Addicted to action. While reading <+++>Magic Slays</+++> I wasn't sure whether I would give it 4 or 5 stars.Of course I loved it ,but I didn't find it as intense as the previous ones .And then the final pages happened and battles and bombs and ancient rituals and massacres occured and everything fell into place. 2.Addicted to sarcasm. Sarcasm here,sarcasm there,sarcasm everywhere !Kate is the queen but every single character has a witty retort ready to strike and make you snicker until you sound like Squidward Tentacles.It's not pleasant for the people around you but don't be ashamed,things could always get worse! (I can't find an example to support my case but I blame the sleep deprivation,I'm sure you can think of something more embarassing than sounding like a grumpy cartoon) \u201cWhat do you mean fainted? Took a dive, kissed the pavement. Swooned like a southern belle after her first kiss. Had a dreadful case of the vapors.\u201d 3.Addicted to Curran. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Many, many things. Curran! I love it when you say my name.It sounds so sexy\u201d Last night I wrote a letter to Santa.I asked him to bring me a possessive,jealous,violent homicidal maniac that behaves like an asshole most of the times and turns into a lion,preferably without any clothes on so I can admire his sculpted abs.No I'm not demented (I think),yes I need a cold shower immediately. 4.Addicted to romance. \u201cIf I fought for them and was crippled, they would all say nice things,and then they would replace me and forget I was ever there. You would stay with me. You would take care of me, because you love me. I love you too, Kate. If you ever became hurt, I would not leave you. I\u2019ll be there. Wherever you want\u2018there\u2019 to be.\u201d Ok I admit,it was this exact scene that convinced me to give the fifth star.Curran and Kate are one of my all time favorite couples,they make me swoon with declarations like this,they have hot sex that makes me blush and then they fight and kick each other in the head without regrets.Kate is still an insubordinate pigheaded ass,Curran is still a manipulative control freak,but they manage to stay together despite their differences because that's what we call love . The time has come to return to the real world with the exams and the essays,but I can proudly claim that no matter how many times Gandalf said I ignored him and dedicated a few hours to read Magic Slays .I hope the book gods will help their faithful servant. ...more \u2763 KD is the Cure to All of Life's Problems Buddy Read (KDitCtAoLPBR\u2122) with my dear wife Ange , and the poor IAA souls who have fallen into our deathly KD Surprise Reread Trap (KSRT\u2122). \u27bd Last rererereread : July 2016. \u270e Previous rating : 8 stars \u270e New rating : I don't know anymore.

THE proof that YES, series don't necessarily need to go down the drain after 4th installment, that YES, series can STILL be interesting after the two romantic interests in the story \"do the deed\" and that YES, plots do not need to become unbelievably twisted, punctuated by improbable events and where mythology gets slaughtered just to get out of the bloody unplanned mess that became your story's outline. Now, instead of giving you a synopsis of the book, I'd rather tell you why this book in particular, but the whole series in general, deserved 5 stars: - because the plot is interesting, well developed, makes total sense, each book is tied to the other but still stands on its own without painful, mean and useless cliffhangers; - because romance in this book is not the vital core of the story but rather like a planet orbiting around a much substantial and well-founded plot - so much so that in the first book there is NO romance and we're still all here, inhaling every single word Andrews is writing; - because vampires, in these books, do not sparkle; - because the Andrews, when they decided to put mythology into their world, did their homework well and decided to stick with what they knew: in this book, they stuck with Russian mythology and used it in a great, clever way - there is no Russian kid who hasn't heard of Baba Yaga that I'm aware of; -because Kate is simply and undeniably the baddest UF heroine out there at the moment; she is clever, disillusioned, snarky and she kicks ass so much that I wish I was her; -because the dialogue is so full of snark, banter, sarcasm and great comebacks that I am SURE everybody has highlighted some part or the other of the book; Finally, the main reason why I think this series is so fortunate: because the Andrews are two. So what? Even P.C. Cast are two. No. I think the fact that a man and a woman have written this series together has given it a great balance. Thanks to Gordon Andrews being present, the books never get cheesy, overly romantic or dangerously stupid. On the contrary, you can see where he puts in his knowledge of weapons, fighting strategies and so on. He gives the books a masculine angle that only helps making Kate even more of a badass. The fact that the authors are husband and wife shows in the dialogues between Kate and Curran, I think. In all this awesomeness, I am not saying that the book - or the series - is perfect. There are flaws: some that have to do with proofreading - a \"door bursts open\" immediately after having fallen into the room - some with the plot - I think there is a certain confusion at times about the form the beasts take, half form, warrior form, full animal. There is a passage where Mahon shouldn't have been able to shift into warrior form yet he does - and some have to do with excessive detailing - those who followed and understood the whole coefficient and proportion thing about probability of loupism please raise your hand. Also, I was pretty sorry that Raphael was not in this book, and I expect him in the next one. Still, somehow, these imperfections do not detract from the general state of satisfaction I was left in after I read the last page of the book. Dear Ilona and Gordon Andrews, if you keep on writing like this, I will gladly buy Magic Whatever # 15. ...more Welcome to the Reader\u2019s Court of Literary Grievances The courtroom was alive with the buzz of conversation.

Today\u2019s case had drawn so many spectators that it was standing room only. Behind the judge\u2019s bench, high on the wall, hung an unimposing, standard-issue clock. As its hands ticked down the minutes, the excitement in the room rose and the buzz of the crowd slowly turned into a low level roar. Fifteen minutes before start-time it was so loud that people had to raise their voices when speaking to their neighbors or risk losing their words to the cacophony that reverberated around them. Every now and then shouting could be heard ringing out over the din, another die-hard fangirl losing their temper in one of the many heated debates that were taking place. \u201cHow can you even say that?!\u201d one woman screamed. \u201cAnita Blake could wipe the floor with Mercy Thompson.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d another chorused. \u201cWell Rachel Morgan is a demon . She could drag Anita into the ever after and leave her there to rot!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019d just screw her way out!\u201d yet another joined in. And so it continued. At one point a scuffle even broke out near the rear doors but luckily it was quickly broken up before it could escalate into a full blown brawl. With the energy level of the room hovering around frenetic, all it would take was one stray punch for the crowd to implode. At precisely three o\u2019clock, a door on the empty side of the bar swung open and those assembled began to fall silent. The first person to appear was the bailiff, a towering man with cold, dark eyes that scanned the crowd as he moved towards his post. Following him were the court clerk, the court reporter and finally, swathed in billowing black robes, the judge. He was not what most of the spectators expected. He was\u2026young. He was handsome too, with broad shoulders, dark hair cut close to his head and gray eyes that seemed to glow with some sort of inner power. Those eyes swept the crowd much as the bailiff\u2019s had and the individuals they fell upon seemed to cower beneath his gaze. Once he was fully ensconced behind the bench, more people filed in through the side door. These were dressed in expensive looking suits and seemed to wear similar expressions on their faces; a mix of supreme confidence and utter boredom. Only the thin bands of sweat on their upper lips or the nervous twitching of a hand gave away their true feelings. As much as they\u2019d like to pretend otherwise, this was not just another court case. These new arrivals took their seats behind the two desks that faced the judge and began to open briefcases and shuffle through papers as they talked amongst themselves. Behind them, the crowd was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. It was as though the collective was holding its breath for something. The last person to enter the room was a woman of medium height and medium build with light brown hair pulled back off her face. This was clearly what the crowd had been waiting for. As soon as they caught sight of her, they erupted, some hurling angry words and threats and others rising up to shout them down in between cheering her as she sauntered over to her seat, a smirk splitting her face. \u201cOrder! Order!\u201d the judge roared, his deep voice echoing throughout the marble and stone room so that it seemed he\u2019d spoken the words three times. Something in his tone brooked no argument and the crowd fell into a low level grumbling and then finally back into silence. Those who snuck glances at him quickly looked away, unnerved by the way his eyes seemed to flash under the electric lights. Taking advantage of the moment, the bailiff stepped forward and spoke into the hush. \u201cToday we\u2019re here to rule on The People versus Navessa in the Case of the Most Badass Heroine.\u201d And so it began. It was the trial they\u2019d been waiting for, the one that would decide it all. Navessa's case was a good one and her lawyers well versed in both Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance. They knew the standards, knew the tropes and the themes and they\u2019d spent months preparing for this. Preparing to prove, once and for all, that Kate Daniels was the most badass main character to ever grace the pages of a book. The prosecution was equally stacked. Among their papers were innumerable quotes spoken by the many heroines that made up their client list. They had weapon inventories, outfit inventories and even in one case\u2026a boyfriend inventory. They had pages and pages of descriptive paragraphs detailing fight scenes, magical badassery, heartbreak and heroism. It would be a tough trial. \u201cWill the prosecution please begin its opening statement,\u201d the bailiff ordered. In response, a tall man with thinning grey hair moved sinuously up out of his seat and strode towards the center of the room, placing himself in full view of both the judge and the crowd. He turned towards his audience with a smile that could have sold souls to the devil himself. \u201cMy job is not to disprove Kate Daniels being a badass,\u201d he began. From her seat behind the defense table, Navessa watched him like a hawk. As he continued to speak, his low, soothing voice ringing out through the room, she realized he was good. He was really good. Listening to him wax poetic about the preponderance of evidence and the impossibility of decisively placing a single character above all others would have made almost anyone nervous. Not her. You see, she knew every single one of his clients. Had known them for years in fact. She knew their dirty little secrets, their hidden agendas and most importantly, their weaknesses. And she and her lawyers were prepared to use it all against them. When the prosecutor was done with his statement, the head of her defense stood and strode to the same spot that her enemy had just occupied. Navessa knew the speech she was about to deliver by heart, she\u2019d helped write it. \u201cKate Daniels, is a badass. This is irrefutable,\u201d her lawyer began. For the next three minutes she laid out their case in broad terms, citing numerous sources to include sales statistics, critical reviews and ratings on book related websites. It was a good speech and the crowd, which had started whispering almost the moment she opened her mouth, slowly fell silent over the course of it. By the end more than a few were nodding along in agreement. The trial lasted three days. Evidence was submitted and poured over in excruciating detail, experts were brought in followed by critics. At the end of the second day a psychologist even spoke, and he seemed to think everyone involved in the trial was in dire need of his services. On the final day, it was the witnesses\u2019 turns. It was these men and women that made the case electric, emotional and absolutely unpredictable. One woman, called to the stand for the prosecution, broke down in tears halfway through questioning by the defense. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why she had to sleep with so many men the way she did. I would have been fine if she had just owned up to her behavior but nooooo, she blamed it on the Ardeur. I hate her now!\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI understand,\u201d Navessa's lawyer smiled kindly, barely masking the predatory gleam in her eye. And therein lay the genius of their defense. For who hadn\u2019t been irritated at one point or another while reading about their favorite heroines? Who hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d acted too-stupid-to-live? Who wasn\u2019t still angry about it on some level? What Navessa knew was that the number of times she\u2019d felt this way about Kate Daniels was a fraction of a fraction of the number she had for the prosecution\u2019s clients. She knew that the amount of other readers that felt this same way might very well win them this case and so her lawyers were vicious in their cross examination of the witnesses. Closing arguments took place at the end of the third day. The same snake of a man that gave the opening statement for the prosecution spoke again, addressing the judge this time, instead of the crowd. There was no jury here today; the decision would come down to the imposing man that had ruled over the past days of proceedings with a solemn face and a quiet dignity. \u201cYour honor,\u201d he began. \u201cHas the defense proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kate Daniels is the most badass of the badass?\u201d Navessa had to stifle her urge to snort. She listened along with the crowd as this man rehashed all the evidence that supported not that one of his clients was more badass than Kate but that the defense had failed to prove that Kate was the most badass. When he was finished a few people in the crowd even clapped and for the first time Navessa felt a stab of worry. But then her lawyer was standing from her chair, striding confidently to the center of the room. She turned not to face the judge, but the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been together in this room the last three days. We know what\u2019s taken place. We know that there is one character that reigns supreme over all others and we know that her name is Kate Daniels so in closing I\u2019d like to site just one more quote and it\u2019s the quote heard round the paranormal world. The one that made us arch an eyebrow, crack a smile. It\u2019s the one that alluded to there being a new badass in town and that she was everything we\u2019d been wishing for.\u201d Here she paused for dramatic effect and Navessa's eyes swept out over the crowd. They were on the edge of their seats, their faces rapt as they waited for her lawyer to speak again. Finally she did, whispering in a low, sing song voice \u201cHere, kitty, kitty, kitty.\u201d No sooner had she taken her seat than the javelin dropped. \u201cThe court rules in favor of the defendant,\u201d the judge spoke in the same monotone he\u2019d been using the past three days. The courtroom erupted in reaction, the prosecution shooting to their feet to protest, the crowd behind them mostly cheering but with pockets contention erupting here and there. As her lawyers shook hands and patted each other on the back, Navessa turned away and pretended to pack up some papers, her eyes straying to the judge as he gathered himself to leave. Beneath her breath, so quiet that someone standing next to her wouldn\u2019t even be able to hear the words, she whispered \u201cNice dye job, Your Majesty.\u201d The judge turned to go as though he had all the time in the world but Navessa could have sworn she caught the hint of a smile playing upon his lips.

But having her own business does Kate not one bit of good, b/c that bigoted jackhole Ted, her ex-bossman from the order, tried to blame the epic disaster that his \"plan\" to take out Erra devolved into on Kate. Anyone with a lick of sense knows that's not true, but come on . . . how much sense does the general population have?<-----NOT much. So Kate sits around in her empty office building, staring at the phone, willing it to ring . . . and it does. And it's Ghastek . . . One of his journeyman necromancers lost control of a vampire, you see. It's headed towards Kate, and some help, please? ALSO--try not to kill it. Kate captures the rogue vamp (b/c awesome), but the cops (PAD) show up anyway, and they're feeling trigger happy. Which is bad. B/c Ghastek, who has also shown up and retaken control of the vampire, passes out, loses control of the vamp again , and PAD start shooting. And they're not shooting handguns with 8 or 12 bullets. NOPE. They are not. They're shooting some kind of machine gun that can (and did) cut a man in half, yes, literally , and can keep shooting a steady stream of ammo for nearly five minutes by Kate's estimation. That's a lot of freaking bullets. So while the cops are distracted by taking out the vamp, that's distracted by the two halves of the formerly whole man, Kate drags Ghastek and another wounded journeyman, and shepherds a nearly catatonic third journeyman into her office, behind her very thick steel door. *bang bang* on the door. Kate says, \"Yeah, what?\" PAD says, \"Lemme in.\" Kate says, \"Ha ha, you're funny.\" PAD says, \"I'll bust your door down!\" Andrea says, \"I don't think you will, and here's why, \"You can either get the paramedics in there or you can let another civilian die of their injuries, break into an office owned by the Pack, assault the Beast Lord's wife, and shoot a knight of the Order. You can do it either way, but I promise that if you somehow survive, twenty years from now, when you're old and broken, you'll look back at this moment and wish you had taken two seconds and thought about what you were doing, because this is the point where it all went very wrong.\" Hold up--where'd Andrea come from? I don't know, but that was mighty serendipitous timing, yes, it was. So there's a lot of posturing, but ultimately, PAD backs down, EMTs grab Ghastek, etc., and Kate and Andrea are alone at last. Andrea tells Kate where she's been for the last month, and Kate offers her a job. One of the best parts of this book is the friendship that is Kate and Andrea. Not only are these two absolutely hilarious together, but the fact that Kate not only has a friend, but a friend she so obviously cares about, who cares about her in return . . . the FEELS, man, the FEELS. Kate is so far from the solitary merc we first met that you can't help but get a little emotional. So Kate and Andrea have only just formed their Kate and Andrea team when Rene (of Red Guard fame) shows up and offers them a job. And it all goes downhill from there. And by \"downhill\" I mean Very Bad Things are afoot. This installment of Kate Daniels is awesome per usual. The only reason I didn't like it quite as much as books 3 and 4 was b/c less Kate History, and the Bad Guy wasn't connected to that history, so it was less personal. The premise though . . . pure awesomeness. And Kate History did play a significant role in resolving a situation that arose as a result of the Bad Guy. (view spoiler) [And who isn't 100% convinced that the voice/presence Kate felt when she was magicking Julie wasn't Roland? B/c it totally was. (hide spoiler) ] This was also a very emotional installment. (view spoiler) [I don't even think Joey had been mentioned before this book. He was a total red shirt, but it didn't matter. When Jezabel lost it, so did I. I sat there boo-hooing, not understanding why I was boo-hooing, but boo-hooing nonetheless. And Ascanio tore me up too. Sitting in that loup cage, huddled around Julie, with ribs sticking out of his side. HE CARRIED HER UP THE STAIRS WITH TWO BROKEN LEGS. *flails* (hide spoiler) ] Maybe it's b/c I've read these books so many times, but the Andrews have done a remarkable job of creating characters that feel real. This installment shows you what a lot of those characters are made of, and it makes you proud of them. PROUD. Of a fictional teenaged shifter who learns what it means to be part of the Pack. Proud of girl who was betrayed by the person she trusted the most, and who dealt with that betrayal by learning to take care of herself. Proud of a woman who lost everything that mattered in her life, but keeps on living. Seriously, if you haven't read these books already, get on that. Best. Series. EVER.

Urban fantasy, when done well like this, is really some of the most effortless reads out there. It gets rather special for me, though, when we get a who's who of mythology showing up, like Greek gods overcharging for body bags and large refrigerated units, or Baba Yaga giving cute little gifts to little girls. Hmmm.. wait... she has a tendency of doing that anyway... oh well. :) The switchover back to tech comes at a very nice time for me. I really wanted a good return to that world-building quirk, and I couldn't be happier. I love mad geniuses. :) And as always, great apocalyptic shit for the end.

Hell, I might even go wild and send a fifth copy to Patricia Briggs, because let\u2019s face it, River Marked really wasn\u2019t all that! Amazing, amazing, amazing! That\u2019s pretty much all I can say about this book. I especially love that there\u2019s some Slavic mythology thrown into the mix. Kate aka bunnycakes and her sugar woogums, His Furriness (hey, her words, not mine) are in a world of trouble\u2026 again! A secret society known as the Lighthouse Keepers hired a crazy scientist. He's building a device that can wipe out all magic within a four-mile radius. Life without magic isn\u2019t easy for most of our characters, but the much bigger problem is that the device also kills every single magical person. That means the Pack, the People, witches, mages and just about everybody else. It\u2019s basically an atomic bomb for the magical community. In addition to that, the Beast Lord and his Consort (who hates to be called Mate) have other problems: Kate finds out the truth about her mother, which brings out a series of very difficult questions regarding her relationship with Curran, Andrea\u2019s retired and not at all herself, a very important person gets mortally wounded, the boudas are creating more trouble than they\u2019re worth and there\u2019s even a pregnant Alpha in the Keep. Favorite quote: I could've fallen for someone steady. Dependable. Well-grounded. But nooo, I had to lose my head over this idiot. After all that, the only thing left to say is: Go read this book.

And I think I've finally come up with the answer. As the story begins, Kate is running the new agency that Curran set up for her since she has left the Order. But despite her competence and reputation, she doesn't have any clients. But just as her best friend Andrea returns from a two month absence, Kate is Coming off the high of the spectacular ending of Magic Slays , I've been staring at the computer for 10 minutes, trying to figure out why it took me a little while to really get into this book. And I think I've finally come up with the answer. As the story begins, Kate is running the new agency that Curran set up for her since she has left the Order. But despite her competence and reputation, she doesn't have any clients. But just as her best friend Andrea returns from a two month absence, Kate is hired to find a missing man and the mysterious device he has built. She investigates; she is snarky; she is magic and bad-ass. But (insert light bulb here) I wasn't very invested in any of it, because Kate seemed to have no stake in it all, beyond completing a job. No justice mission like she had when searching for Greg's killer; no revenge for a brutal attack on a friend; no saving the world from a deranged aunt. Just a job. It was when Kate realized what the device could do and what it would mean to her world, that I began to perk up. And then we were off and running. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that the device could have huge ramifications on Kate and all those she loves, if it is activated. And as we get into the second half of the book, Kate encounters a personal crisis, that makes her willing to risk everything to fix it. It's when Kate is desperate and loyal and determined that she is at her best. And here she shines, a heroine in the greatest sense. Curran is back as Kate's mate, and I was worried that some of the spark would be missing from their relationship, now that it's more permanent. But Kate's paranoia keeps them from falling into the old-married couple routine. She still has questions about whether things can work for them long-term. But as the story progresses, he proves himself to be an utterly worthy hero. And I still enjoyed the fire between them. For the last third of the book, I was completely unable to put it down. The ending was fantastic and sets up even more drama for the next installment. I can't imagine that Kate will be able to keep her secret for much longer. 4 1/2 stars. *ARC Provided by Penguin Group USA ...more Yes I am reading this again....3rd time is a charm.

Found the kid an impossible job, did he? Derek laughed quietly. Ascanio finally deemed it necessary to acknowledge Derek's existence. \"Is something funny?\" \"I don't even know you, and I feel sorry for you.\u201d Kate you are the freaking best.

(hide spoiler) ] Real Coherent Review from Sept 29 2013 Possible minor spoilers books 1-4 Kate and Curran are finally together as a couple and that means she is struggling to learn what it is to be not only a member of a pack but also half in charge of it. Kate is also trying to get her business that the pack fronted the money for up and going. So far it isn\u2019t going well until a case lands in her lap. \u201cRene, you want us to find you-don't-know-who and to retrieve his you-don't-know-what for you-won't-tell-me-whom?\u201d Well at least it is a job. With the help of Andrea and Derek, Kate is off and running with it. But it seems the you-don\u2019t-know-what part of the job might just in fact destroy the magical community. There are brand new witches and warlocks, more unusual mythology along with revelations from Kate\u2019s past that lead her to question everything about the man she thought of as her father. Many of our favorite characters are back, the boy wonder Derek, Julie, Saiman, Aunt B and Andrea of course as well as one of my new favorites Barabas the were-mongoose. Nanny/adviser to Kate he is trying to help her become more like the alpha for the pack she needs to be. \u201cI know it's late, but could you find a book for me? It's called The Slavs: Study of Pagan Tradition by Osvintsev.\" Barabas sighed dramatically. \"Kate, you make me despair. Let's try that again from the top, except this time pretend you are an alpha.\" \"I don't need a lecture. I just need the book.\" \"Much better. Little more growl in the voice?\" \"Barabas!\" \"And we're there. Congratulations!\u201d There are again some heart wrenching choices to be made and humungous obstacles to overcome. I really liked the plot of this book and the interactions of course between Curran and Kate. Both are so broken in some respects but always fiercely loyal and overprotective of one another. \u201cYes I can,\u201d Curran snarled. \u201cListen: this is me telling you what you will not do.\u201d I raised the cookbook and tapped him on the nose. \u201dBad cat.\u201d Kate really comes into her own in some respects in this book. She takes charge and doesn\u2019t back down from a fight no matter if it is in the council room, with Curran or against her newest enemy. She has to deal with some of her insecurities steeping from being alone for so long and not knowing how to depend on and trust others around her. Magic Slays is another good book in the series showing Kate getting stronger so that ultimately she can face her biological father. In each book she has picked up another piece of her power and that is true of this one too. But it seems that the odds will still be insurmountable if she ever comes face to face with the man who gave her life. It will be interesting to see how the authors come up with a believable ending to the series but I\u2019m sure with everything they have put into this it will be fantastic. Sept 29, 2013 But just a quick question for the other Kate Daniels lovers. In the first few books Kate is supposed to be careful who she has sex with because there can be some sort of transference of power through sex But that doesn't appear to be happening. Unless now it has just changed to someone using her power because she loves them. Or are they still using protection and so condoms also protect against magical transfers as well.

I have no idea what to write. It was amazing, as always. But I guess I already said that. Uhm\u2026 oh yeah, I think I got something. I am so grateful for not having another Cat and Bones ( Night Huntress ) book. Yes, I like couples fighting crime together but it all has a limit. I want independent characters not a freaky Siamese-like couple talking eating sleeping and shitting at the same time. Yes, I used to love Cat and Bones a lot. Now they\u2019re boring, a thing of the past. I didn\u2019t want this to happen to Kate and Curran. Curran\u2019s absence from Kate\u2019s little adventure is a breath of fresh air in the world of urban fantasy couples. But eventually Curran was replaced by Andrea. At first I wasn\u2019t sure if this is better or not but eventually all was well. Andrea makes a good Watson to Kate\u2019s Holmes. I\u2019m so curious about Andrea, Roman and Raphael. I usually hate love triangles but this one seems to be so much fun. I am sure we\u2019ll get to see Roman again. Hell, I want to see Roman again. I loved the guy! I actually would like Andrea to dump Raphael\u2019s ass (for good \u2013 I know she still has perverted thoughts towards his furry behind) and go for Roman. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll happen. What do you guys think? Is she better with Raphael or should she go for the evil-hottie-that-is-actually-not-so-evil-but-kind-of-cute Roman? He heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cWe could do this like civilized people. But no, now I\u2019ll have to go to your office and unleash plagues on things, and set things on fire, and condemn things. Nobody wants that. Just give me the staff and we\u2019ll call it even. I am trying not to be a bad guy here.\u201d See how awesome he is?? Do. You. See?? Oh, you do? Good.

She now has to deal with pissed off police, her adopted niece Julie who disappeared, and accept a very questionable assignment from an elite guard unit called Red Guards. Kate's life became anything but boring. In my opinion this was the second best book of the series after Magic Strikes. It has its own share of problems, but the positive parts overweight negative ones by far. The things I do not like include the following. The authors missed a chance to show a very interesting battle with a bridge troll. We are shown Kate rushing in, the next scene start with a description of the aftermath. Was it the desire to keep the number of pages low which influenced this? I realized I do not care about Julie. I understand that she is 15-year-old girl - and we all know what is means - but I do not find a single redeeming quality in her at all. I really could not care less what would happen to her. She is a failure as an interesting character. The ending felt rushed and the resolution felt kind of on the easy side, but when you think about it, this was the most logical thing what would happen as the forces in the fight were nowhere near being equal. In the good parts I liked the appearance of some very colorful characters from Slavic (Eastern Slavic?) folklore. I did not expect for Baba Yaga to appear the way she was described here, but let us call it artistic liberty. The biggest reason for high rating was a moral of the story. The humanity created myths for as long as we can recall; some of them were very ingenious, some quite gruesome, some quite entertaining. Despite this, we - the humans - have yet to come up with a creature/monster/god/entity more dangerous than a bunch of fanatics in real life. Our collective imagination is not up to the task, simple as that. I said it was a moral, but at no point in the story this became preachy, or hammered relentlessly. Well done, dear authors! The plot was entertaining and fast-moving. Everything taken together constitutes a solid 4-star rating.

She needs to learn how to trust Curran and this is hard. She has learned from a young age that all males will eventually try to manipulate her and take advantage of her. Is Curran going to do the same? She is so suspicious and scared of this possibility, but her heart is telling her otherwise. Curran is just Curran. Just adorable. There is a scene in which he gets mad and he tears up her cookbook. 5 minutes later, he just goes back to buy her another. 3.\tAs the female Alpha of the Pack: she has to \u2022\tobey rules and laws \u2022\tfollow protocol \u2022\thave escorts and bodyguards \u2022\tattend formal dinners \u2022\tbe the judge of conflicts between pack members and answer petitions \u2022\tmake decisions about other peoples\u2019 lives and \u2022\tthink about the Pack first, naturally! Kate feels her choices are being taken from her. She needs to be careful every time in order not to cause a diplomatic episode or not to test Curran\u2019s patient. Additionally, she is not sure if his Furriness is truly worried about her or if he is just a manipulative bastard. 4.\tShe will learn the bitter, ugly, painful truth about her mother Kalina and her stepfather (Hint: Kate\u2019s can also be called Katenga).

Kate has to learn to be a parent and to provide parental advice. 6.\tShe has to come to terms with the fact that she will lose someone close to her. This is unacceptable for Kate. And I agree. 7.\tIt is about time to embrace and practice her magic! A strange machine with unknown use and a secret anti-magic society are going to keep Kate and her friends on their toes and they will add complexity to the book. Everyone who knows the secret just runs away and you have a constant feeling that the city is doomed. There will be an excellent, epic battle with all the elite magic beings of Atlanta united against the common enemy. Pure awesomeness. I truly love how the relationship between Curran and Kate develops, how their emotions deepen and explanations are given about how much they mean to each other.

He makes my heart beat like crazy. \"\"Laugh while you can. You have to sleep eventually, and then I'll take my revenge.\" \"You're such a violent woman. Always with the threats. You should look into some meditation techniques...\" I had to stop myself from skimming through the book for all of the Kate and Curran scenes. I have a serious Kate and Curran addiction and I don't want help. Their scenes together were absolute perfection. And we really do see how much Curran cares about Kate. Aww...ummm..Kate do you mind if I steal him away from you? I love him. \"Jealous of the actors now, are we?\" \"What, of some fancy boy on the screen? Inconceivable.\" Oh, this was going to be good. So Kate is Consort to the Beast Lord and I bet you are all wondering how she is doing at that. She is so bad ass. Even though Curran tells Kate what to do she won't take any of that shit. haha.

There are some things that we get to learn about Kate's past that she didn't even know and it made me tear up a bit, but that's because I love her. As Consort, Kate does have a little power and there's this one scene in MAGIC SLAYS where I am like \"Best Kate Daniels Showdown EVER! You Go, Girl!\" We do get some surprises along the way that I will not spill, but it made me go WHAT?! HUH?! and YEAH! A lot of crazy emotions all at once. Characters that I worried about, laughed and cried with and you will too. MAGIC SLAYS does not disappoint. Look forward to having your butt glued to your seat(like Curran glued Kate's butt to her chair in Magic Bleeds LOL) all day while enjoying yet another astounding book in the Kate Daniels Series ...more First read July 2014 Second read May 2016 This time this book was even better.

He was interested in more than your bed, I can tell you that.\u201d .......................... \u201c-that you\u2019ve chained yourself to this man who seeks only to further his own interests at the expense of your feelings and safety, and that his careless use of your power has drawn the attention of your father.\u201d ........................... \u201cOne way or the other, the clash between Roland and the Pack was coming. What did Curran have to lose by mating with me?\u201d You see, with all these, how can I believe in Curran's honesty? I see the things as they are. A war is coming and Curran has the best weapon to confront Roland. I got my answers about this. I get to see what Curran thinks about the pack and the war, and I liked him for what he said, but then BOOK #6 happened and I was back to disliking him. This book was more about Kate and her relationships with the people who helped her growing up. I felt so sorry for her and all the things that her stepfather made her do. \u201cMy whole childhood was a lie. Even Voron\u2019s thirst for vengeance wasn\u2019t real. It was implanted in him when my mother\u2019s magic had seared his brain.\" ......................... \u201cAll of it was so when my father and I met, we could kill each other, and Voron would have the last laugh.\u201d .......................... \u201cI was the biological by-product of a megalomaniac and a woman who magically brainwashed others into doing her will, and I was raised by a man who reveled in the knowledge that my biological father would one day kill me.\u201d Of course I would like things to have been different, but all those made her powerful and fearless. Kate is a very special woman who deserves the best. ( cough *Hugh* cough) :P The book felt a bit dark, so many deaths. My heart broke for Julie. The scenes where Derek stands by her are so beautiful. Kate's thoughts and feelings for her made me cry. That's pure love. Despite this, the humour is never absent. The confrontation between Evdokia and Gregorii is priceless. This book has the best ending. (view spoiler) [ Hugh congratulating Kate and sending her flowers.... (hide spoiler) ] * swoons * If that is not romantic, then I don't know what romance is.

There is a lot of change going on in Kate\u2019s life in this one; navigating a new relationship, trying to rein in her street-savvy teenage ward, the start-up of her new business. There\u2019s lots happening here, guys and ghouls, even outside of the actual mystery itself.

(hide spoiler) ] There\u2019s lots of snark on display, as per usual, but there is quite a bit more camaraderie and politics going on than in previous books. I still found the actual language used in this story questionable but the meat of the story more than made up for it this time around. The Big Bads in Magic Slays are of an entirely different nature, one that is more feasibly horrifying to me. We get introduced to a new teenaged bouda who\u2019s libido gets him in some trouble but whom I think I am going to grow to like quite a bit.

Deal with it. Philosophy Rage is a powerful thing. People get upset over many things. Frustrating jobs, small paychecks, bad hours. People want things; people feel humiliated by others who have the things they want; people feel deprived and powerless. All this gives fuel to rage. The anger builds and builds and if there is no outlet for it, pretty soon it transforms the person. They walk around like a loaded gun, ready to go off if only they could find the right target.

Feels like cheating. *** \"Did he write tragedies?\" \"No. Comedies. Good ones too.\" Doolittle drank his tea. \"I don't trust tragedies much. It's easy to make a person sad by showing him something tragic. We all recognize when sad things happen: someone dies, someone loses a loved one, young love is crushed. It's much harder to make a man laugh--what's funny to one person isn't funny to another.\" ...more I really really thought of giving this book a lower rating. You may ask why, is this book bad? Not at all, it's actually pretty awesome. Is it not well written? Nope, it's just as perfect as the others. So what is my problem? One thing, only one thing kind of destroyed this book for me, the whole \"Julie\" part. Let me elaborate. In my mind I have created an image for Kate, she is stubborn, loyal, courageous, smart, gutsy,..., and most important of all she doesn't let anyone decide for her, she doe I really really thought of giving this book a lower rating.

In my mind I have created an image for Kate, she is stubborn, loyal, courageous, smart, gutsy,..., and most important of all she doesn't let anyone decide for her, she doesn't follow orders, she doesn't abide to any authority. The image I have created for her just doesn't add up to a person who would take the decision she took for Julie in this book. The person in my mind wouldn't do this to someone else even to save their lives, she would find it some kind of rape. I felt like they told me for the first time Santa Claus is a myth. If she does an Anita Blake and start saying things like \"it couldn't be helped\" and \"I couldn't do anything else\" I will have to shoot something! End of mental breakdown! As for the rest of the book: Things start going south for Kate when her PI office is hired to investigate the dissapearance of a scientist. Kate manages to find that the scientist was building a dangerous machine that could destroy Atlanta and everyone she loves and now it is in the hands of a group of fanatics who doesn't care for how many lives it will cost when activated. Kate and her friends have to stop them by any way they can. What I liked in this book: 1) I mostly liked Kate and Curran as much as I did in the other books. Their relationship remains strong but not sappy and they don't suddenly go to the toilet together, they both have their jobs and lives and they both continue to be strong minded and independed so except for the part I mentioned before these two continue to be one of my favorite couples. 2)I liked Andrea again. I felt a little satisfied with what the Order did to her, petty I know but I think of it as punishment and she is better off without them. I mostly enjoyed her \"fight\" with Aunt B. I really want them to fight and Andrea to be the budda Alpha. 3)I liked the story. The book didn't resolve many things in the main plot of the series (Daddy-Kate match) but it gave us enough information to keep us interested. The mystery with the lost scientist and the bad fanatics was good enough to keep you glued to the book and it was as always well written so no complaints there. 4)The secondary characters were as always interesting. I especially like Rowena, Ghastek and Evdokia. As for the bad, the only black spot for me was Julie but honestly it was almost enough to make me want to close the book and save myself the dissapoinment.(almost) Deffinitely looking forward for the next one and I really, really hope that Kate will find a solution to Julie's issue. The end of this book sparks your curiosity for what is to come next but we have to wait. *snif* My favorite moments: \u201cAndrea raised her hand. \u201cThis is the hand that slapped Aunt B.\u201d \u201cMaybe you should have it gold-plated.\u201d \u201cHere, you can touch it, since you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d \u201cI know it's late, but could you find a book for me? It's called The Slavs: Study of Pagan Tradition by Osvintsev.\" Barabas sighed dramatically. \"Kate, you make me despair. Let's try that again from the top, except this time pretend you are an alpha.\" \"I don't need a lecture. I just need the book.\" \"Much better. Little more growl in the voice?\" \"Barabas!\" \"And we're there. Congratulations!\u201d And many more but I'm too bored to look for them. **************28/07/2014 UPDATE************** BR with Aly !! ...more June 2015 Reread: Is it possible to mate and have offspring with a series?

This is the fifth installemnt of the Kate Daniels series and I LOVED IT ! I completely completely consumed it this book, no page was left unturned, no word undevoured! In the last book it was left with Kate and Curran finally getting their freak on and becoming mates, and Kate starting up her own PI business with a little assistance from the Pack. In Magic Slays it has been a couple of months and she hasn't had a single client which, isn't surprising been as Ted her former boss at the Order has been bad mouthing her. But, when she does finally get her first job of finding out where a kidnap victim is she stumble on more then she bargained for and the whole of Atlanta's magical communiity have to team up or face certain death. Although I love the action packed plots of all the Kate Daniel books, in this book I found myself looking forward to some Kate-Curran interaction and was a little worried that now they have gotton together the funny push and pull of their relationship would disappear; however, it was a needless concern, the two of them have still had heaps of chemistry and the witty banter that marked their relationship from the beginning. I loved watching them figure out exactly how they were going to life together, both of them are stubborn and used to getting their own way so sparks definately fly and although this book is fairly tame in the sex department, it is mostly fade to black, you can still feel the heat between them. This book also expanded more on Kate's crazy family, and I really can not wait for the final confrontation between Kate and Roland and how it will pan out, Kate is like Spiderman she always beats the big bad guys even though she seems to have less power they they do, I just hope she can do the same with Roland. I have a feeling though that Hugh might be in the next book, her step father's prodigy and Roland's right hand man. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was that I wanted to see Andrea and Rapheal together! There wasn't a single confrontation between them! They can't split up! I can't allow it damn it *shakes fist*! They were perfect for eachother! I really loved this book, not only did it have a fast action packed plot, but it had my favourite couple in it and it has left me waiting very impatiently for the next book! ...more This is number five in the series and it still maintains its momentum and interest levels.

I love it. 20 July 2014: $1.99 on Kindle Review (sort of): I plan to do a full review of this later - these are just my quick thoughts. I loved it!! Ilona Andrews just continues to blow me away with their stories. It's such a deep, vivid, layered world with complex characters around every corner. I liked the reality of Kate starting her own business. Of having partners/employees. The difficulties and issues that come with that and how she handled them. The growth and development in Kate and Curran's relationship is fantastic. This isn't just an HEA, ride off into the sunset; this is an HEA in progress (to steal Ilona's words). There are hurdles still to be overcome, trust still to be issues, secrets still to be discussed, and compromises to be made. I'm confident in their HEA, I know they'll never falter, never give up on one another and never let each other go...but it still takes effort for both of them at times. I like that we see that. Also the issues with Kate being the other half of the Alpha pair. There's some politics that take place in this book, and all I can say is I was cheering for Kate when she was done. Loved the way she handled a very tense situation. The action of the storyline is intense. What starts as a job quickly becomes possibly the biggest threat that Kate has faced yet. There are some mind-blowing bits of Kate's history revealed in this book. I'm still trying to wrap my head around them, and decide what to take at face value and what to dig a little deeper on. In addition to this, there's the trademark humor, smart-assedness and absolutely heart-wrenching moments. I laughed out loud more times than I can count, and teared up just as often. The last few chapters of the book are a wild roller-coaster of a ride, that I'm going to be reading again right now for what I'm sure I missed. All in all, great book, great story. Must read and I highly recommend this series. ...more I feel I should warn you: Ilona is actually a power word that means read . After 5 books, 3 novellas and 1000 squeals in 6 days, you would think the novelty would wear off. NOPE. There is still such a freshness to the story and so many more storylines to be explored. Derek? More please. Jim and Dali? More please. Kate and Curran? I WILL SAY PLEASE BEFORE AND THANK YOU AFTER. Basically, I can't get enough and it's a great feeling. Book slump? What is that?

The stakes are raised even more in this book because as Voron repeatedly told Kate, caring about people makes you vulnerable. And for the first time in her life, Kate has people she truly cares about and vice versa. In Magic Slays , there is a mysterious device that puts them all at risk. I love that Kate and Curran are so evenly matched. This is one of my favorite quotes from the book: \"You're free to leave. Go home, kiss your wives, hug your children, and put your affairs in order, because tomorrow I will burn your neighborhood to the ground. We will kill you, your families, your neighbors, your pets, and anyone who will stand in our path. An attack on my family will not go unpunished.\" It was said by Curran, Beast Lord of Atlanta and BAMF, but it could just as well have been said by Kate, former mercenary and all around BAMF. In a week, I've gone from silently mocking the cover (a lion?!) to wanting to start a Fuck Yeah Curran tumblr. Yes, it's that serious.

Kate is insecure about their relationship, always afraid that she is going to lose Curran. On the other hand, Curran is working on the relationship in his own special possessive way. What makes this series special to me is the amount of research that the authors put into it. I loved the use of lore from Jewish, Russian, Slavic, and Native American cultures. The way in which the lore is incorporated into the story seamlessly is a testament to their talent as writers. There were so many things to love about this book. I liked that we learned more about Kate\u2019s background and her upbringing. Kate and Andrea\u2019s moments together were great. It\u2019s nice to see Kate surrounded by people that care about her.

Kate has some angst about both of those things, but it soon gets overshadowed by a particularly difficult, and dangerous, couple of cases that Kate is offered. What do uncontrolled vampires on the loose and a disappearing inventor have to do with each other? And can Kate solve the cases and avoid getting herself and her loved ones killed in the process? It's especially difficult when her ward, Julie, absconds from the private school where Kate had sent her and makes her way back to Kate, and Curran has major issues every time Kate walks into danger. If you've read any of this series, you know what you're getting by this time--lots of ass-kicking, sarcastic dialogue, conflicts and makeup scenes with His Royal Furriness, and freaky dangers--and this is a good one. The plot was a tense one, even if the ultimate bad guys didn't strike me as particularly believable (view spoiler) [, because weird exotic monsters are so much more plausible than a group of non-magic people who are willing to commit mass murder to eradicate magic from the world again (hide spoiler) ] .
