How Monk deals with the personal and professional fallout galvanizes this audacious, hysterical, and quietly devastating novel.\u201d My Review : Why am I giving this only two and a half stars? Because, in my world, books that have satirical aims should have sharp focus and clear line-of-sight on their target. I'm not clear on the target here: Modern Murrikin kulcher in general? Political Correctness and its idiotic unintended side effect of glamorizing substandard stuff? The sad fate of a critically acclaimed but commercially ignored writer? \u201cAll of the above\u201d seems to be the answer Everett gives, and this is the source of my discontent. With that many targets in his sights, plus the plight of children of aging parents, plus the sibling dynamic in a family of high achievers...too much. Nothing gets enough time or attention. It's a damn shame, too, because Everett can write his tuchus off, and should have spent his seed a wee tiny bit more carefully. In the ten years since the novel was first published, it has (sadly) not become less timely. So there's that going for it. But really, with all the terrific books there already are to read, why spend money and eyeblinks on an almost-good one?

He finally succumbs to temptation after seeing the Oberlin-educated author of We's Lives in da Ghetto during her appearance on a talk show, firing back with a parody called My Pafology, which he submits to his startled agent under the gangsta pseudonym of Stagg R. Leigh. Ellison quickly finds himself with a six-figure advance from a major house, a multimillion-dollar offer for the movie rights and a monster bestseller on his hands. ...Ellison becomes a judge for a major book award and My Pafology (title changed to Fuck) gets nominated, forcing the author to come to terms with his perverse literary joke. i once heard a writer complain how difficult it is to write satire these days -- when the satire and the satiree both show up on the letterman show, mug at each other's jokes, and then laugh together all the way to the bank. that is, there's a complicity in most so-called satirical entertainment with the essential mode and delivery methods of what is being satirized. ERASURE isn't like this. its satire stings because it's generous and complicated enough to shame and indict all of us for the creation and maintenance of a market-driven intellectual life, a literary culture that rewards sensation and provocation over art, and an unquestioned and reductive -- even internalized -- racist ideology. for a more in-depth overview of some of everett's source material, check out this review by bernard bell , which, while analyzing well what the book does, also ends itself with a sly (if i'm reading it right) criticism of the protaganist's (and maybe the author's) vantage of privledge: \"Contrary to the popularity in the academies of anti-essentialist arguments by postmodern critics, the authority, authenticity, and agency of the identities of most African Americans emanate most distinctively and innovatively from the particularity of our historical struggle against slavery and its legacy of antiblack racism in the United States.\" what ellison the character argues in ERASURE is that blackness is, must be, wide enough to include his own subjectivity. however, forces both within and without this novel refuse to cooperate, assigning the black identity only to a particular (romanticized and fetishized) \u201cinner-city,\u201d \u201cgritty,\u201d and \u201cghetto\u201d experience. everett screams foul at such a distortion. ishmael reed agrees, having written a few years before this article on the scapegoat idea of a \"black pathology\" (a phrase which everett uses to name his street lit parody). reed writes: \"The only difference between white pathology and black pathology is that white pathology is underreported.\" but all the above discussion aside for a moment, let\u2019s acknowledge too that, while freighted with heavy consequence and while trying to make real points and to hit its targets hard \u2013 ERASURE is a pleasure to read, mostly for its patient, uproarious but never overwrought nor sensational prose. what a touch it is to be all in one book: deadly serious, furious, and howlingly funny. ...more I took an advanced fiction class from <---A>Percival Everett</---A> and admired him immensely as a teacher and person, so I finally got around to reading one of his books.

It's the story of a brilliant Black man who defies popular (and forced) stereotypes about black men - not unlike Everett himself though I'm sure he would resent comparisons intensely. The character - Monk - is so discouraged by the lack of audience his uber-intellectual books receive and the publishing world's unthinking acceptance of badly written \"black\" novels that he writes a parody of \"black\" literature called \"My Pafology,\" later retitled \"Fuck\". The story revolves around what happens when this book becomes a runaway success and Monk must face the monster he's created. The language is stunningly effortless and the work is one of those meta-fiction, postmodern books that aren't utterly repulsive/inauthentic to read. It's a pretty quick read as well and is almost entirely worth it just for the text of \"My Pafology\" which Everett actually gives in the center of the book. Definitely a must-read. ...more If Erasure is about anything, it\u2019s about identity. Ones we invent for ourselves, ones we invent for others, ones that are forced on us, and ones that we lose.

Though I am fairly athletic, I am no good at basketball. I listen to Mahler, Aretha Franklin, Charlie Parker and Ry Cooder on vinyl records and compact discs. I graduate summa cum laude from Harvard, hating every minute of it. I am good at math. I cannot dance. I did not grow up in any inner city or the rural south. My family owned a bungalow near Annapolis. My grandfather was a doctor. My father was a doctor. My brother and sister were doctors. While in college I was a member of the Black Panther Party, defunct as it was, mainly because I felt I had to prove I was black enough. Some people in the society in which I live, described as being black, tell me I am not black enough. Some people whom the society calls white tell me the same thing\u2026. The hard, gritty truth of the matter is that I hardly ever think about race. Those times when I did think about it a lot I did so because of my guilt for not thinking about it. I don\u2019t believe in race. I believe there are people who will shoot me or hang me or cheat me and try to stop me because they do believe in race, because of my brown skin, curly hair, wide nose and slave ancestors. But that\u2019s just the way it is. (pp. 1-2) There are two foci to the book. The first is the satirization of the publishing industry; the second is Monk\u2019s relationship with his family. Monk\u2019s books languish unread because publishers and bookstores don\u2019t know how to market him. A publisher complains in a rejection letter that he \u201cshows a brilliant intellect, certainly. It\u2019s challenging and masterfully written and constructed, but who wants to read this shit? It\u2019s too difficult for the market. But more, who is he writing to? Does the guy live in a cave somewhere? Come on, a novel in which Aristophanes and Euripides kill a younger, more talented dramatist, then contemplate the death of metaphysics?\u201d And a reviewer moans that \u201cone is lost to understand what this reworking of Aeschylus\u2019 The Persians has to do with the African American experience.\u201d When the \u201cauthentic,\u201d African American novel, We\u2019s Lives In Da Ghetto by Juanita Mae Jenkins (whose experience of inner-city life extends to a few days spent in Harlem) rises to the top of the best-seller list, and the author receives accolades and lucrative publishing/movie deals, Monk writes a scathing parody titled My Pafology (subsequently renamed Fuck! under the nom de plume Stagg R.

A typical resident of \u201cda hood.\u201d He convinces his agent to shop the book around, and Random House picks it up for $600,000. Of course, Hollywood becomes interested in making a movie based on it. And to add grievous insult to near fatal injury, it\u2019s named the best book of the year by the awards committee he\u2019s sitting on despite his attempt to derail the nomination: \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s a bad novel\u2026. It\u2019s no novel at all. It is a failed conception, an unformed fetus, seed cast into the sand, a hand without fingers, a word with no vowels. It is offensive, poorly written, racist and mindless.\u201d Wilson Harnet, Ailene Hoover, Thomas Tomad and Jon Paul Sigmarsen just looked at me, none of them speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s not art,\u201d I said. Ailene Hoover said, \u201cI should think as an African American you\u2019d be happy to see one of your own people get an award like this.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I said, \u201cAre you nuts?\u201d \u2026 \u201cI would think you\u2019d be happy to have the story of your people so vividly portrayed,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cThese are no more my people than Abbot and Costello are your people,\u201d I said\u2026. \u201cI learned a lot reading that book,\u201d Jon Paul Sigmarsen said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a lot of experience with color \u2013 black people \u2013 and so Fuck was a great thing for me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d I said. \u201cPeople will read this shit and believe that there is truth to it.\u201d Thomas Tomad laughed. \u201cThis is the truest novel I\u2019ve ever read. It could only have been written by someone who has done hard time. It\u2019s the real thing.\u201d (p. 261) The second focus of the novel \u2013 Monk\u2019s personal life \u2013 receives less attention than the first, which is unfortunate because it\u2019s potentially more interesting than the first and could have been more extensively mined. There\u2019s Monk\u2019s mother, whose identity is rapidly being lost to Alzheimer\u2019s; there\u2019s Bill, his older brother, who has come out after being divorced by his wife; there\u2019s Lisa, his older sister, a doctor at a woman\u2019s clinic who\u2019s been murdered by an anti-choice fanatic. And there\u2019s his deceased father, whose heretofore unknown love affair with a British nurse he met in Korea suggests a private life and identity that his son completely missed. And there\u2019s Monk\u2019s own struggle to be honest with himself and respond to the demands society and the expectations that people in his life have of him. For the most part, I enjoyed Erasure . There were times when the satire became heavy handed and distracting, but not to such an extent that I wouldn\u2019t recommend this book strongly. ...more Thus my P.E. obsession loses its vestigial tail and sprouts wings . . .

Thelonius Monk Ellison. Monk. Monksie. Theo. Ellison. Mr. Monk. has never felt a part of anything, least of all, his dysfunctionally ideal upper-middle-class Washingtonian family. His contempt for all things disingenuous, including himself, at times, has alienated him from his colleagues and his readers, whomever they might be. It is only after the combination of a family tragedy and \"mourning\" sickness-like reaction to the runaway success of one Juanita Mae Jenkins\u2019 novel We\u2019s Lives In Da Ghetto, does he decide to write his own parody of what he sees as the racist drivel which the sheep-like masses consume, grazing wherever they are herded by the media and their own embryonic palates. What follows is a series of events that ask: 1. What is the responsibility of the artist to his/her art and form? 2. Should one be true to duty or true to love? 3. Is it possible to be loyal to love but not to a lover? 4. Is \u201ckeeping it real\u201d selfish, to a fault? 5. Can you truly love someone and be disgusted by the idea of their presence? Can that someone be oneself? 6. Does the weight of a secret outweigh friendship and family? 7. Who is hurt more by stereotypes? The tereotypes, or the stereotypers? 8. Is a black artist black, then an artist, an artist, then black, or is this just a dumb ass question that people need to finally stop asking? 9. Can an intellectual ever really love and live with someone who has remedial taste in books without holding them in contempt of art? 10. Can I too write a crappy book in a week and get a $300,000 check for poisoning the literary community and perpetuating stereotypes for decades to come? No. Really. Can I? I can\u2019t say much more without pre-empting your \u201cahh\u201d moments, but I will say that the structure itself, with the ancient Greek-like choruses of artists\u2019 conversations and fishing and woodworking metaphorical tales only solidifies the truth in my prior P.E. comment: \u201cWe\u2019re not worthy.\u201d Favorite Quotes: Dammit, a table was a table was a table.

My journal is a private affair =, but as I cannot know the time of my coming death, and since I am not disposed, however unfortunately, to the serious consideration of self-termination, I am afraid that others will see these pages. Since however I will be dead, it should not much matter to me who sees what or when. The hard, gritty truth of the matter is that I hardly ever think about race. Those times when I did think about it a lot I did so because of my guilt for not thinking about it. But this book was a real slap in the face. It was like strolling through an antique mall, feeling good, liking the sunny day and then turning the corner to find a display of watermelon-eating, banjo-playing darkie carvings and a pyramid of Mammy cookie jars.

Both methods have worked and failed. It\u2019s all up to the trout. I have often stared into the mirror and considered the difference between the following statements: (1) He looks guilty. (2) He seems guilty. (3) He appears guilty. (4) He is guilty. This is a tortuous journey through the banal.

I was much more interested in the publishing and soi-disant avant-gardist parts than the family drama parts (though there again, I suspect the family drama may be part of the point, both about form and about the 'easy lives' of those who aren't 'black enough'). But none of that stops this from being one fucking hell of a great book, or Everett from being ridiculously under-read. Because here's what: whatever sour grapes I may have expected, feared from this particular set up, the man has a point. Where are this book's readers? Surely we could spare some percentage of those currently attributed to, say, Junot Diaz (to say nothing of Harper Lee) to read what is just an empirically better book? On the language use writerly chops front, there is no comparison. But what's even better, when you read this book, you can see glimmering there behind the prose the shape of the intelligence that made it, and going by the results, Percival Everett is one hell of a smart guy. If we are even going to leave behind the morass of hysterically exaggerated pseudo-political denunciatory smarm that masquerades as a discourse about race (well, more and more, as a discourse about anything at all), we are going to need smarter people to do the discoursing. And perhaps we wouldn't even be in this fucking mess to begin with if people were reading books that actually know how to maneuver the power tools of language without lopping off a finger, people who know how to make something a little better than a lumpen ashtray for their moms in ceramics class. People might already understand that, say, writing a negative review of Go Set a Watchman is NOT, in fact, tantamount to elder abuse*, because that's a term that means chaining your granny to the radiator, not doing your job as a reviewer by writing about a much-talked about piece of published fiction. People might have better success evaluating where the tough ethical issues actually do and do not lie, and which words are actually appropriate for which events. In some ways, I think the issues are actually bigger and more all-encompassing than our friend Monk allows for. I think Mr. Dullard will win that rigged game no matter who plays against him, race, gender, creed, whatever, because the underlying problem is that the world likes dull. It may be worse for an author of color, but the problem goes way beyond that. It's also because, well, Mr. Dullard has got a lunch later on today with Hustvedt's Mr. Glib, and they are going to market the shit out of him, creating a media event which make Twilight look like your block's garage sale. And who are these....people, who claim to be powerless over \"the market\", as if it were just some entity lurking there in the dark, a bogey man waiting to eat us all cause what can you do, gotta pay the mortgage, as IF they did not create this very same market because nobody, and I mean nobody, in giant all-powerful corporate america puts that much uncle-fucking moola in their marketing budget if they do not think that that shit is working. To parapharse Aaron Sorkin, people who cannot manage to sell Percival Everett books should get out of the selling stuff business. This book, Monk, our guy, does show some of that, though he sees this phenomenon as part and parcel as a kind of drooling lusty slavering over his masquerade of put-on blackness**. It's possible that I think this is a missed opportunity (again, though, I could be convinced). But it's also possible that PE and I just differ, which is one of those things that can happen to you when the person with whom you are engaged, with whose art you are engaged, is actually smart and is willing to step up and have a fucking opinion. And that's what this is. This is somebody kitchen-knife sharp going all in. Whatever the book's imperfections may or may not be, they are not due to catering to \"the market\", to fear or compromise or lack of courage or wussing out. I simply cannot believe that there is no market for that. ________________________________ *actual quote from one of my book groups on this here site.

Horrified by the stereotypes and the dialect in it, he sets out (angrily) to write a book just as horrible and titles it \"My Pafology\" (later changing the name to something that the publisher suggests he spells 'Phuck' so as not to alienate more sensitive readers--he refuses). Of course, he submits it to his agent and the book gets attention, raves and an obscenely large advance. The problem is, Monk didn't submit it as himself. He submitted it under the pen name of Stagg R. Leigh, and endowed his doppelganger with a rap sheet and prison time in his past. Of course, everyone wants to meet the infamous Stagg, further complicating Monk's plan and forcing him into an even greater charade. Ever more humorous complications arise and the book is finally nominated for a prestigious award for which Monk is made a member of the jury. To recuse, or not to recuse?? That delightful romp aside, the book is also about relationships and love and filial duty...and about the damage a father inflicts when he dubs one child \"the golden child\" and emotionally excludes the others. (Damage, by the way, that is done not only to the siblings, but also to the golden child.) Outside of his publishing woes, Monk loses a sister who is a successful OBGyn for underpriveleged women (at the hands of a radical right-to-lifer who guns her down), a brother who has come out of the closet and can't reconcile his relationship with Monk, and a half-white, racist half-sister he didn't even know he had until he found an old stack of his father's letters. Monk is also slowly losing his mother to Altzheimer's disease, played out in tragic / comic scenes that were utterly devastating to read. Here's an excerpt from a scene on the day he decides to finally put her in a home: I watched as she poured the water into the pot and dropped in the ball that I had already filled with tea. She put the cups and saucers on the table and set the pot between us. \"Isn't this nice?\" she said. \"Yes, Mother.\" \"My favorite time is always waiting for the tea to steep.\" She looked past me to the screened porch. \"Where is Lorraine?\" \"Lorraine was married last night.\" \"Oh, yes.\" She seemed to catch herself. Then she appeared very sad. \"Will you miss her?\" I asked. She looked at me as if she'd missed the question. \"You were just thinking about Lorraine, weren't you?\" I asked. \"Of course. I hope she will be very happy.\" Mother poured the tea. \"I'd like you to pack a bag this morning,\" I said. \"Why?\" She held the cup in her hands, warming them. \"I have to take you someplace. It's kind of a hospital.\" \"I feel fine.\" \"I know, Mother. But I want to make sure. I want to be certain that you're all right.\" \"I'm perfectly fine.\" \"Your father can give me a pill or something.\" She sipped her tea, then stared at it. \"Father's dead, Mother.\" \"Yes, I know. There was a cardinal outside my window this morning. A female. She was very beautiful.

The novel itself is a dazzling kaleidoscope of narrative, history, art commentary, and philosophy. Much of it is extremely funny. Why there\u2019s so little comedy in writing these days I don\u2019t know. Maybe that quality of the satiric wit is just plain that rare or maybe television has eaten up all the talent. Anyway, if you want some of it, go to Everett. But back to the book. Thelonious Ellison, nicknamed \u201cMonk\u201d (what else?) writes obscure novels, eschews any hint of commercialism. His name refers, of course, both to the jazz musician and Ralph Ellison, author of the classic, Invisible Man. The name seems a bit silly and artificial at first, but develops layers and layers of meaning as the book proceeds. As the book opens, he\u2019s about to deliver a paper to an obscure society of writers. We get the whole paper, which is entitled \u201cF/V Placing the Experimental Novel\u201d Behold the first sentence: The title perhaps answers any question before it is raised, making it in some sense an anti-title, but a title nonetheless, thus offering the suggestion of negation. I was pulled in a for a few minutes, thinking I was reading something meaningful and not getting it. Not too much farther along, though, it was clear that we were being put on: Let us [like Barthes[ designate as hermeneutic code (HER) \u201call the units whose function is to articulate in various ways a question, its response, and the variety of chance events which can either formulate the question or delay its answer. . . \u201c Amusing, perhaps, only to an academic with a sense of humor, but I\u2019d like to have five dollars for every befuddled intellectual who put shoulder to the wheel and tried to make sense of the nonsense. What the paper does is establish \u201cMonksie,\u201d as his mother calls him, as a true outsider. He\u2019s agreed to deliver the paper primarily because it buys him a plane ticket to see his family in D.C., where he grew up. His dad is dead. His sister, Lisa, is a doctor, giving her life over to women\u2019s health in a poor neighborhood. His brother, also a doctor, is in Arizona, having just come out of the closet and been divorced as a result. During course of the narrative, Ellison goes through a number of rather common family tragedies and encounters one rather Dickensian moment. Mother declines, manifests dementia, forcing Monk to move to D.C. to take care of her. And he discovers the existence of a half-sister, the product of an affair his father had. All of this Everett tells feelingly, and gives us the picture of a man forced to come in contact with his emotions and conscience for the first time in his life. And it\u2019s a struggle. In and of itself, that part of the book would be worth reading. But something else much less conventional also parallels, then subsumes, this main plot. In disgust over the success of a recent novel purporting to immerse the reader in the language and events of black life, We\u2019s Lives In Da Ghetto, by a young fresh-out-of-Oberlin-coed who once spent two weeks in Harlem, Ellison sits down and pens a parody. He entitles it My Pafology by Stagg R. Leigh. Main character is a 19-year-old gangbanger named Van Go Jenkins (Everett loves his names, doesn\u2019t he?) He instructs his agent to send it out, and you can guess some of what happens. But not all of it. And it gets deeper and more complicated than you can imagine. Where does Monk begin and Staggerlee stop, both as individuals and as black men? How could all this possibly connect to the family drama that surrounds it? Complex, fascinating, wonderful reading. I\u2019m on to another Everett. This one another name drama. I am Not Sidney Poitier. There are at least three levels in the title, but you have to read it to know. . .

I loved the way Everett laced miniature plays throughout his text, ironic encounters between famous artists. (Cecille B. DeMille and Richard Wright was perhaps my favorite pairing.) The family relationships are drawn sparely and poignantly; Everett does an amazing job evoking the joint violence and passivity of Alzheimer's and the difficulty of being grown children coming to terms with a parental past and a sibling-dominated present. Those parts of the book, dealing with paternal expectations, maternal decline, and fraternal miscommunications, moved me very much and formed my favorite elements of the novel. To lay my cards on the table, I find it a little difficult to read books that vent frustration about literature and the publishing industry because while I know those grapes have good reason to be sour, it feels problematic to reflect on your particular formal experiments as a lone poetic voice in the cacophony (the only bottle of pinot on a shelf of Two-Buck Chuck, to avoid the mixed metaphor). Even if Everett doesn't let his protagonist, Thelonious Ellison, maintain that artistic purity, I can't help feeling (perhaps unfairly) the implied author's superiority. That complaint being voiced, some of Everett's satirical jabs at literature, race, and the publishing industry were both scathing and satisfying. My two faves: \"Tom Clancy was not trying to sell his book to me by suggesting that the crew of his high-tech submarine was a representation of his race ( however fitting a metaphor ). Nor was his publisher marketing it in that way. If you didn't like Clancy's white people, you could go out and read about some others.\" \" Jo Blow's new novel takes on the mundane and leaves it right where it is. The prose is clear and pedestrian. The moves are tried and true. Yet the book is not so alarmingly dishonest. The novel is ordinary but not insipid, pointless but not meaningless, savorless but not stale. \" The hardest part of the book for me to read was the parodic novel within a novel (closely followed in difficulty by the conference paper within a novel, but I won't even go into that here) Part Native Son , part gang fiction, the novel takes up seventy pages of Everett's prose, and he plays with exaggerated dialect (chapters named \"Free,\" \"Fo,\" \"Fibe,\" and \"Sex,\" for example) and proliferating violence, sexual and otherwise. I think I was supposed to find this section funnier than I found it, even though Ellison (and obviously Everett too) finds it tragic as well. It really disturbed me. Maybe that was what it was supposed to do, but it made those seventy pages successfully unrelenting. I'll admit that I preferred the personal story to the bigger thematic target of the book (authorship, publicity, literature, and racial representation). The characterizations were beautiful and understated, the family drama familiar and specific to these characters at the same time. My favorite line in the novel is about Ellison's adult struggles to keep his family afloat as his mother drifts into dementia: \"I wouldn't use the clich\u00e9 that I was the captain of a sinking ship, that implying some kind of authority, but rather I was a diesel mechanic on a steamship, an obstetrician in a monastery.\" ...more This is the story of a black author, artist and intellectual who is greatly respected in small circles, yet has not (and does not seek) fame for his talents.

The ending is dazzling, the writing is superb and lively. The story is, quite frankly, exceptional. This author has remarkable intellect and skill, I\u2019m certain it is an autobiographical fantasy. It is clever in ways that are hard to imagine, showing remarkable creativity, yet not confusing like other experimental novels. It seems a true rendering of what it truly means to be an authentic black man in America, not the clique that is so prevalent in public discourse. I have to give it 5 stars, it is that good. There are snippets of literature, art, experimental poetry woven in. I didn\u2019t even understand much of this, but I loved it (think Vonnegut).

The book addresses the popularity of the urban fiction genre (books like Push/Precious ), and what that means for African-American authors who want to escape being pigeon-holed into writing about certain subjects pertaining to racial identity. This book makes the subject entertaining and most of the characters believable and sympathetic. The plot is really split into three threads. Monk, the main character, wishes to publish experimental literary fiction, but he feels pressure by his agent to write a book about race, while he also watches the urban fiction author of We's Lives in Da Ghetto go on Kenya Dunston (a parody of the Oprah Winfrey show) to promote her book. Monk's sister is murdered, and he finds himself taking care of his mother who is in the progressive stages of alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, he tells us the story of his brother Bill, who comes out to his wife and two children, then must deal with the struggles of being an openly gay black man. At first I wondered if he wasn't juggling too many topics, because I was interested in all three, but the book kept changing the subject just as I was getting into one of them. Then I hit the middle section, which is a 60-page story called My Pafology by Stagg R. Leigh, an urban lit book that Monk starts writing while taking care of his mother as a form of stress relief, then sends it to his agent to see if it would sell as a parody. Only the book gets accepted as a serious depiction of the African-American experience, and now he feels pressure to take the money and guest appearances offered to him, and to become a sell-out who is misrepresenting the community as a whole, because he needs the cash to look after his family. It is the third section of the book which managed to weave together most of what he started in the first act. I could see how everything in the novel and the meta-novel was selected to show the contrast between Monk and his fictional character's viewpoint of the world. I was impressed how much this book kept me reading and eager to find out what happens next, because I've read far too many literary fiction books lately that just drag on with too much filler. There are some unnecessary scenes provided to flesh out Monk's personality throughout the book, but Everett seems aware of the tendency of information unrelated to the plot to weigh the book down, and he keeps these pretty short, usually a brief paragraph. I also felt a lot of empathy with Monk and his situation with his mother, because I've been through something similar with taking care of my own grandmother. Everett really does a good job of presenting the conflicting feelings that arise with that situation. I think everyone worries about putting their parent into a assisted care facility, and it's hard to admit that the time is right, when there is also the risk that if you wait too long, something could happen to them. It's a very scary situation to go through. My only disappointment is with the third plot thread about Bill, which tapers off to nowhere, nor does Bill leave the story under circumstances that are made particularly clear. I was very interested in Bill and really would have liked to see some sort of resolution to this thread. I mostly liked this book, however, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. I just wonder if this might had been improved a bit if it had also mentioned similar problems faced by more mainstream or genre authors looking to publish on a subject other than race. I mean, I totally believe his argument that he's being pigeon-holed as a African-American writer, because I've seen enough stories about it from other people on the internet to know this is a real phenomenon, but it makes it a bit harder to make a case with an experimental literary novel, because, let's face it, not many people buy or read much of that stuff. Experimental books are going to be tough to sell to a publisher no matter who you are. And there are degrees of intelligence in storytelling between a semantic breakdown of an academic critique of a literary novel like F/V: Placing the Experimental Novel and We's Lives in Da Ghetto that are not acknowledged by this book, because the author seems to think commercial fiction beneath him, and I find that disappointing. ...more Erasure is an exceptional fictional novel by Percival Everett concerning the literary world and its controversial acquiescence of African American literature.

His literary works carries no mentions of the stereotypical black experience of being raised in a household full of turmoil, and living in a poverty stricken \u201cghetto\u201d neighborhood, nor does it echo the angry black citizen who relies on crime and drugs to cope with being Black in America. However, he has unwillingly noticed that publishers now have an insatiable thirst for works by Black writers that resembles We\u2019s Lives in Da Ghetto, the first work and best selling novel by fictional author Juanita Mae Jenkins. Monk loathes this novel, for its literary prose has no traces of intellectual comprehension. Furthermore, an African American woman who has never lived first hand in the environment or lifestyle she so ineloquently writes about, earns her millions of dollars, a highly critically acclaimed novel, and rights to a movie adaptation of her best-seller. While observing the grievous success of the novel, Monk experiences financial dilemmas and heart wrenching family difficulties. In an act of desperation, vexation and shear anger, Monk writes a novel that resembles Jenkins\u2019 novel entitled My Pafology, but under a false name Stagg R. Leigh. Irony settles as the novel Monk creates as an insulting joke to Jenkins\u2019 novel is welcomed with great enthusiasm by the literary world. Publishers that were once rejecting his previous works of literature are now flocking to his manager to meet Leigh, while offering a large amount of money for the early release of his novel.

I love the balance of voices that he uses for Monk and the punch of the prose. Thelonious Monk feels like he's going crazy by the end but he's still one of the most sane people around. It's almost like a horror movie where you wonder whether you really are crazy because everyone else seems to think you are and by association you consider whether your choices are sound. It's like the Literary equivalent of \"The Twilight Zone\" and he captures it perfectly. At a time when Tyler Perry is the go-to entertainer for African-Americans it's insightful that \"Erasure\" pinpoints the African-American on the 'outskirts' of their race. One not identified with the caricature but not often seen in media so as not to be believed to exist. And when Monk plays into the stereotype to find that it is welcomed open-armed by even those he thought he respected is confusing and continually disheartening. Everett captured the frustration at the heart of many artists whether it's feeling like your art is truly art or maybe attempting to accept the subjectivity of it as a whole and go with the flow. Are we sell-outs if we go for the money and conform to a formula or are we just playing the game and earning our due? I appreciate that there's no final answer for this and that we're left with the results but not the complete story. ...more \"I watched his lips and realized I understood nothing he was saying. His language was not mine...I could see the shapes of his meaning, even hear that his words meant something, but I had no idea as to the substance of his meaning. I nodded.\" I start with this quote because I feel like so much of this novel is trying to answer the question: How does a man find his true place in the world when he wears so many different masks? The question is also: How can a black man, specifically, experience the \"I watched his lips and realized I understood nothing he was saying.

The question is also: How can a black man, specifically, experience the world if so many different masks are forced upon him? I am not sure of the answer, but as I finished Erasure I realized how much language plays a part in it. With each new language that a person becomes fluent in, with each new way that someone interacts with the world, they get farther and farther away from the people who know them closest (meaning the people of their culture as well as the people of their immediate family). Theolonius is a man's name. A man who is nicknamed Monk, a man who is an Ellison child and a man who writes a parody of the black experience called \"My Pafology\" under an imagined name. This man gives himself many identities throughout his life and as he gets older begins a process of shedding each mask and trying to understand the man that lies deep within. I thought it was a good book! Percival Everett is a good writer and though at times it would get a little dull, it was pretty easy to get through. I would recommend this book! ...more I would without hesitation stack this book up against any great postmodern work--Coetzee, the magical realists, anyone. The conception of the book is brilliant. The plot centers around Thelonious Ellison, an African-American writer of dense and unreadable prose whose aesthetic includes heavy reliance on retellings of Greek myths. As a joking parody, he writes a novel mimicing the degradingly stereotypical We Lives In Da Ghetto (his literary arch-nemisis), which Ellison publishes under the pseudo I would without hesitation stack this book up against any great postmodern work--Coetzee, the magical realists, anyone.

As a joking parody, he writes a novel mimicing the degradingly stereotypical We Lives In Da Ghetto (his literary arch-nemisis), which Ellison publishes under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh. But his satirical parody is taken for a serious work of fiction, and becomes a best seller, even winning a really prestigious literary award. As this happens, Ellison's mother develops rapidly progressing Alzheimers, losing her identity and memory in a parallel to the struggle Ellison himself undergoes to maintain the boundaries between his own identity and Stagg Leigh. In almost every way this novel is self-conscious in the issues it raises--issues of identity, art, integrity, literary culture, and honesty. ...more What a great book. Just read it. It will shatter (perhaps) any preconceived notions of what \"black writing\" (whatever that might be) is. Everett throws in everything here -- a parody of academic non-writing, a demolition of white-centric notions of black literature (again, whatever that is), and most important of all, a genuinley moving story about a man alienated from his own family, coping with his aging mother's failing health.
