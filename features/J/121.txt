{"Comments": "SCOTT WESTERFELD,<---M> WHY YOU SO AMAZING? Like</---M>, seriously.<---F> It's not fair</---F>. I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a <---A>Scott Westerfeld</---A> book. Sure, some are better than others, but they always have such awesome world-building, they're always exciting, and they're always a ton of fun to read. It's hard to beat his previous series like Uglies and Midnighters, but I think he just may have done it with the Leviathan trilogy. First of all, the premise is so freaking awesome I want to explode when I think SCOTT WESTERFELD, WHY YOU SO AMAZING? Like, seriously. It's not fair. I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a Scott Westerfeld book. Sure, some are better than others, but they always have such awesome world-building, they're always exciting, and they're always a ton of fun to read. It's hard to beat his previous series like Uglies and Midnighters, but I think he just may have done it with the Leviathan trilogy. First of all, the premise is so freaking awesome I want to explode when I think about it. In case you haven't read these books and know nothing about them (<---B>shame on you</---B>), they're about an alternate WWI, fought between the \"Darwinists\" and the \"Clankers.\" The Clankers use machines as airships/weapons, while the Darwinists use giant, fabricated animals. The story takes place on one of the \"airbeasts\" called the Leviathan . Our two main characters are Alek, the prince of Austria whose parents have recently been murdered, and Deryn, a girl pretending to be a boy named Dylan so that she can fight in the air service. Well, I guess that's about all I can say without giving a rundown of the entire plot. But it already sounds awesome, yes? So let's just say ... These books rock my socks off. And they just get better as they go along. I really liked Leviathan and Behemoth , but I LOOOVED <+++>Goliath</+++> . It's such a wonderful book and such a terrific ending to the series. First of all, as I've already mentioned, Westerfeld's world-building never disappoints. And he really steps it up with this series. It's awesome how he draws inspiration from actual history and puts such an original spin on it. The machines and creatures he creates are super cool, and the books in general have a very distinct, gritty atmosphere to them that separates them from his other novels. Secondly, the illustrations are just ... the bomb. A lot of credit for these books' awesomeness must go to Keith Thompson, because his drawings are stunning. Sometimes I would just want to sit there and stare for five minutes. He draws everything in such amazing detail, with so much to look at. There's already a lot of great world-building in the prose, but the illustrations really help to bring the story to life. Thirdly, the characters. Ahhh, I love them! I think Deryn is a slightly stronger character than Alek\u2013\u2013both literally and figuratively. (I feel like Westerfeld's female characters are always more kickass than his male characters. Which is awesome and all ... I just happened to realize it. :P) But anyway, they're both still very likable characters and you can't help but sympathize with them. And I have to say, the romance is just ... perfect. YA literature needs more romance like this! I'm tired of all the books where the girl is all wimpy and the guy has to come and save her butt. In these books, it's pretty much the opposite. ;) Not only that, but the relationship actually takes time to develop. Sure, there's the whole \"Oh dear, he thinks I'm a boy\" thing standing in the way, but even so it's a carefully crafted romance and I appreciate that. I didn't really know how it was going to play out, and I was afraid it was going to be too dramatic or whatever, but it wasn't. It was great. Gah, I don't want to give too much away. But basically, if you've read the other books and haven't read this one yet, YOU NEED TO READ THIS ONE. And I'm pretty sure it'll make you happy. :) If you haven't read these books at all ... well, read them. And now I'm going to run around shouting \"BUM RAGS!\" and \"BARKING SPIDERS!\" Good day. ...more 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars Update 12/20/11 - Bonus chapter to <+++>Goliath</+++> posted on Scott Westerfeld's blog.

What a great way to end a series! I want more! The third and final book in Scott Westerfeld\u2019s Leviathan series did not disappoint. Set during WWI, our heroes Dylan (actually Deryn, a young woman) and Alek are on board the living airship the Leviathan (a giant floating whale!) as it flies eastward towards the orient and beyond. Goliath is an alternative history and retelling of WWI. History buffs will enjoy this book as they see some of the historical characters of the period appear in this book. Steampunk fans will marvel at all of the contraptions and gadgets. The book is geared towards young adult readers, but many adults will enjoy this book as well. Westerfeld builds a unique world where Darwinists create machinery and weapons using DNA to battle against the mechanical steam powered contraptions of the Clankers. The Clankers favor machinery on legs rather than wheels. Whimsical creatures populate the pages. There are beasties such as strafing hawks, flechette bats, fighting bears, message lizards and my favorite: the perspicacious loris. Beautifully detailed illustrations by Keith Thompson make this world come alive. Thanks to the illustrations, I was able to imagine all of the cool contraptions and gadgets developed by the Clankers and even the strange creatures engineered by the Darwinists. I found myself lingering on these pages. I would read a little, flip back to the illustrations, and just stare at them. I must say that my e-reader did not do justice to these illustrations. I think (and your results may vary depending on your e-reader) that a dead tree book may be preferable for this series. The story is captivating. There are some pretty intense moments, great on the edge of your seat reading. I enjoyed the astute observations of the perspicacious loris. I loved the specialized vocabulary from this book. I might just have to use some of those words, they may come in handy. Thank you, Scott Westerfeld for writing such an engaging series. My 12 year old reluctant reader is enjoying this series. I fully expect him to start calling his brothers \u201cbumrags\u201d and \u201cdummkopfs\u201d sometime soon. *Thank you Simon & Schuster Galley Grab for an advanced reader copy of this book* Review posted on Badass Book Reviews ...more Fans of Leviathan and Behemoth will be very satisfied with this final installment, which seems to be the end for Alek and Deryn. This book contains, in spades, all of the elements of the previous two books that I adore. Deryn doesn\u2019t brood, she acts! And Alek, well\u2026he might brood just a squitch but that\u2019s barking princes for you! There is a remarkable lack of melodrama here. These books are dynamic and exciting with plenty of action and derring do. Deryn and Alek are once again aboard the giant l Fans of Leviathan and Behemoth will be very satisfied with this final installment, which seems to be the end for Alek and Deryn. This book contains, in spades, all of the elements of the previous two books that I adore. Deryn doesn\u2019t brood, she acts! And Alek, well\u2026he might brood just a squitch but that\u2019s barking princes for you! There is a remarkable lack of melodrama here. These books are dynamic and exciting with plenty of action and derring do. Deryn and Alek are once again aboard the giant living airship Leviathan, this time on their way to Japan. When the Captain receives a mysterious message from the Russian Tsar, they must make a detour to rescue the magnetic Nikola Tesla who claims to have invented a weapon that is capable of wreaking massive destruction on any city that he chooses to target. He also claims to have peaceful intentions, and the potential to end the war quickly is very attractive to Alek. World War I rages on, and Alek still believes that he has a destiny to hasten its end, but Deryn is far more pragmatic. I\u2019ve read more than my share of cross-dressing girl adventures, and Deryn will always hold a very special distinction to me. I know that I already mentioned this in my review for Behemoth, but it bears repeating. Deryn is more at home as a boy than any other disguised heroine that I\u2019ve read about. And yes, the relationship between Alek and Deryn does develop in this last installment (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not divulging any details here), but my girl Deryn does not let me down, and Alek! Well, let\u2019s just say that he\u2019s honest and faithful and he has a lot of integrity. There are no scenes in any of these books where Deryn suddenly appears bathed, coiffed, and squashed into a fabulous dress. Not only that, but she never has one moment of self-conscious worry about her appearance. That\u2019s not Deryn, and it never will be. Why would she need to worry about silly things like that when she has wings and the air? (And more guts than I\u2019ll ever have.) All of my favorite characters are back, along with some new ones including a few distastefully aggressive American women, and fun cameos from William Randolph Hearst and Pancho Villa. My favorite \u201ccharacters\u201d by far in this last installment are the highly entertaining Perspicacious loris twins, whose little side-commentaries add so much insight and wit. As with the previous installments, the Clanker inventions and Darwinist monsters are highly imaginative and detailed, and the illustrations are wonderful. Perfect Musical Pairing Ben Folds Five \u2013 Don\u2019t Change Your Plans This is a love song about two people who have destinies and plans that conflict with their relationship, and the sadness of not being able to be together.

This is a wonderful conclusion to a charming steampunk trilogy for children. I enjoyed the preceding novels but this third volume impressed me even more. It seamlessly threads together classic Young Adult tropes, various steampunk motifs, actual history and historical characters from World War I and beyond, and a breathlessly paced series of fun adventures into one rather grand story. It is more than just a joy to read \u2013 it\u2019s also often surprising and genuinely moving. There were moments that shocked me and there were moments that struck me right in my so-called heart. Appealing characters, superb illustrations, and even a thoughtful and touching afterward. A great achievement by Westerfeld. The cleverness of these novels also inspired my own attempts to be clever, here and in the prior two novels' reviews: Leviathan Behemoth ...more \"Reality had no gears, and you never knew what surprises would come spinning out its chaos.\" Dear Alek, I know in my review for Behemoth I told you that I was going to dedicate this final review to you and I would think of a theme tune for you.

Now I love Deryn as much as the next person (she truly is spectacular) but I feel a lot of people look over you as a hero of this series. I guess heroes come in all shapes and sizes and sometimes they are even shorter than some girls. You are proof that you don\u2019t have to have guns blazing (Although I find walking sticks to be just as useful) all the time to show how brave you are. For in your understated-ness (Shh, it\u2019s a word) you are intelligent, strong, trustworthy, loyal and caring. And you are not a \u201cwaste of hydrogen\u201d. I have a feeling you\u2019ll have plenty of time to get your sea-legs in the future. Um\u2026 air-legs? What do you call them if your vessel is a flying whale? \u2026.. Basically , I just wanted to say that I think you are one of the most underrated characters in YA literature. You can have your vampires, your werewolves, your angels, your ones with a destiny or the ones who survive fighting in arenas but I\u2019m an Alek girl, through and through. Anyway I won\u2019t keep you because I know you and a certain Mr Sharp have better things to do. Lots of love, Jo. PS. I\u2019m not sure how often you see Mr Westerfeld but if you do get chance to catch up, will you please thank him for writing such an exciting and beautiful ending to one of the most innovative, original, sweetest and completely-head-over-heels-in-love-and-best-friends-and-ohmygod-it\u2019s-so-lovely-and-butterflies-in-my-tummy romantic series of YA books that will always have a special place on my bookshelf. And also, Mr Thompson- tell him that that final picture almost slayed me. And the picture of the loris with the moustache is probably my favourite thing in the entire world. PPS.

So, it has come as a bit of a surprise to me that I've enjoyed the Leviathan trilogy so much. At first glance it doesn't seem like my kind of thing at all. The Darwinist/Clanker technologies are interesting, but nothing that gets me excited. I'm not into war fiction, and historical fiction has been very hit-or-miss in the past. The reason I love these books is the characters. So in this review I will try to briefly illuminate these people. They are real and don't try to tell me they're not. Alek . He is nearly heartbreaking with his unique blend of naive hopefulness and high sense of honor. This boy is serious to the core. So unlike the male heroes of most YA books these days. (view spoiler) [SO MANY PRECIOUS ALEK MOMENTS... his horror/stupidness when he found out about Deryn, his giving up of his ultimate secret to save Deryn's identity, his sobs as he stands in Goliath's control room thinking Deryn is going to die. AHHH that last part. Killed me. (hide spoiler) ] Deryn . I've probably been unfair to Mr. Sharp in my previous reviews. Alek had taken hold of my heart and I had no room for her. Fear no more, dear, for now I am all yours! What I appreciated about her was how different she was from His Serene Highness. Deryn is spontaneous, irreverent, and recklessly brave. Not to mention a bit of a show-off. I love the description of her as the \"bell captain\" and I long to be one myself. Only in my dreams, sadly. Bovril . LOVE. He/she/its perspicacious-ness was only getting stronger in this final installment! I found myself longing, absolutely longing, for a Leviathan movie, simply to get to bask in Bovril's cuteness on the big screen. Bovril forever. Tesla . Aka MR. BAMF. Fighting off multiple monstrous Russian fighting bears with just his walking stick was a fitting introduction for this marvelous man. Yes sir. (view spoiler) [I was very upset when it turned out he was a fraud/crazypants... I so wanted and believed him to be legit! But I guess that makes me just as gullible and persuadable as Alek. (hide spoiler) ] Count Volger . He is consistently great. Also, the Count was responsible for one of my favorite lines (in response to Alek irritably telling Volger to have some faith in him): \"I have great faith, tempered with vast annoyance.\" Honorable Mentions go out to Dr. Barlow, Klopp, Miss Rogers the girl reporter (LOVE HER), and the Leviathan itself. ABSOLUTELY NO LOVE WHATSOEVER goes out to Eddie Malone. Bum-rag. (view spoiler) [Lastly, I find it incredibly hilarious that, at the end, Alek and Deryn presumably settle into a life of love together... but with Deryn still pretending to be a man, at least for now.

Alek, the son of the assassinated Serbian archduke, draws her into his ambitions to support the scientist Tesla in forcing an end to the war through the threat of a powerful death ray weapon. The potential of the powers-that-be to demonstrate the weapon without a Hiroshima-like attack on Berlin or Vienna has Alek tormented over how to intervene. The travels in this volume take them first to the Siberian site of the mysterious explosion that leveled a whole forest. With Tesla aboard, they travel on to Japan, across the Pacific to California, across Mexico, then to New York City. There are colorful roles for movie stars, reporters, and Pancho Villa in the plot, and periodic thrills of combat with Imperial German forces who intend to keep the Darwinists from exploiting Tesla\u2019s mad genius. Along the way, Alek finally learns that Dylan is a girl. There is still the barrier of class to the future of any romance between them, as Alek is Hapsburg nobility and Deryn is a commoner.

Suffice to say, you have no room for boredom. End mild spoilers Characters Let me reiterate from my first review of the series how much I loved Deryn Sharp. What an excellent character . She has to be one of my most favorite characters in any novel that I have read, ever. And that is saying something. This is how I pictured Darrin Sharp: As for the rest of the characters, even though I didn\u2019t have an affinity for them like I do Deryn; I still found each of their personalities to be original.

Second, I reserve the full 5 stars ranking for my very most favorite books, i.e. Lord of the Rings, and sorry, while this was good, but not quite up to that caliber. All in all, I think this book would come off way too weird and too farfetched for many people, but if you have similar tastes to me and like steampunk, I would definitely give this series a whirl, you won\u2019t be bored, that is for sure!

(props to Westerfeld for this romance. Ummm wow. Can we just. Can we just have whole books. About Deryn and Alek. Being adorable. And a little bit emotionally insecure. Actually that's part of the adorable.) (hide spoiler) ] I think I sort of lose my reviewing ability when I hit book 3 in a trilogy. There are a couple of reasons: one, it's the culmination of an experience. I've heard people say they have trouble reviewing the first book of a series because it should be judged by how it fits in to everything else; I am the opposite. I can't review the last, because my feelings about it are tangled up in my feelings for the first and second and are generally far too complicated to put into words. If you asked me about this book, or about The Hero Of Ages, in person you would get a lot of flailing and some squeaks and a whole heap of inarticulateness. That might be considered a mostly accurate portrayal of my emotions. Oh, the second reason: dancing around spoilers. Talk about a pain. So. A review that is as specific as I can make it while still letting it be necessarily vague. This series is insanely readable: suck-away-your-time readable, but also damn-where-did-the-pages-go-I-want-more readable. It is also insanely good . Just, you know, good in an essential way, because it is good on several levels. The history is really cool, as are the deviations from it. (Japan with its more integrated Darwinist and Clanker technologies and those horrifying kappa. Russia's bears - dear god those things are terrifying when they're starved; creepiest illustration to date - and then America with a civil war about technology and not just ideology.) Also the characters! Okay, so Alek's nonstop blather about his DESTINY and FATE and whatnot bother me. I'm not a huge fan of the concept of destiny in general. But he's still a great guy, and a great character. And every now and again, Deryn calls him on it, or at least thinks something very eyerollish about it, so all is well. Deryn is just head-to-toe pure wonderful . I love her strength and her determination and her iron will and her self-control and her spine and her courage and her secrets and her intelligence and basically everything. (view spoiler) [Their romance stole my heart completely. To adopt an overused Tumblr phrase: CUTIES. I loved the way Alek thought of her as his best friend, even when it was obvious to everyone and him that he loved her. And that he basically said 'screw destiny' and killed a man for her sake, nothing else. Okay, I'm not huge on the whole choosing-love-over-best-thing-for-world thing, but this wasn't exactly that, since Goliath would have done as much harm as good if not more. Bottom line is it worked and I just wanted them to kiss and fly forever. (hide spoiler) ] Oh, and TESLA. How did I enjoy Tesla in this book? Let me count the ways. He was fucking crazy, that's for sure. But the way that his machine echoed the atomic bomb? Or am I reading too much into it as an aftereffect of my freshman seminar on the Manhattan Project? I don't think so, not really. Maybe Westerfeld didn't do it consciously, but Tesla's machine definitely resonated in the same way - the thing that could both level cities and provide power; a weapon designed to bring peace. As I was reading, I imagined the Bomb in the hands of one desperate, hurt, brilliant man and got chills . Umm. I am not very articulate tonight. Thinking and writing in fragments. Here is the point: read this series. There are authors who treat YA as a low-quality cesspit for their corniest blather; Westerfeld is not one of them. This is the good stuff, the cream of the crop. Set it up in a place of honor next to the Chaos Walking and Thief Errant series, in the lineup of the best YA being published right now. (oh, and Mr. Westerfeld, if you read this: should you ever be inclined to write a series about the Adventures of Deryn and Alek Kicking Ass FOR SCIENCE! And Also Lots Of Snogging And Being Adorable, I'll read it. I'll even pre-order it in hard cover and my college student budget be damned. My priorites are in the right order, dammit.) ...more Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan series is a favorite among steampunk fans so it's no surprise that the finale book would set new levels of awesome. I was going to attempt to hold off reviewing this book since it doesn't come out until September but I simply couldn't resist. This is a series that I would liken with Harry Potter because it's very action-adventure, boy/girl friendly and PG. Just because there are historical references in this series doesn't mean it will be boring. In fact, it makes th Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan series is a favorite among steampunk fans so it's no surprise that the finale book would set new levels of awesome. I was going to attempt to hold off reviewing this book since it doesn't come out until September but I simply couldn't resist. This is a series that I would liken with Harry Potter because it's very action-adventure, boy/girl friendly and PG. Just because there are historical references in this series doesn't mean it will be boring. In fact, it makes the story more interesting than your average story about genetically engineered beasties or steampunk contraptions. And as the finale book, Goliath had everything it needed to wrap up the the compelling plot in this trilogy and appease fans. Goliath picks up where Behemoth left off. After the revolution in Istanbul, Alek and Deryn find themselves back on the Leviathan and heading east. Alek's princely status has been outted but Deryn is still struggling to keep her gender secret, all while she has feelings for Alek. Even if he knew she was a girl, he couldn't be with a commoner. And when he finds out the secret she has been keeping, he might feel betrayed learning the boy he looked up to, was in fact a girl. Unfortunately Deryn has to contend with Count Volger. He knows her secret and he intends to use that knowledge to black mail her. Alek is unsure if he will ever be the Archduke regardless of his letter from the now dead pope. Regardless, he feels he is in a position to put an end to the war and when opportunities (and important people) arise, he goes all diplomat. Unfortunately, this puts a rift between him and Deryn whom he doesn't seem to have much time for anymore. New characters will be introduced like the imposing Mr Tesla and old characters will resurface like the meddling reporter Eddie Malone. Trust me when I say the plot balances the novel perfectly with Scott Westerfeld's outlandishly awesome characters, imaginative world and creative writing. I will read anything he writes because he is just THAT phenom. The ending was nothing short of perfection and I will admit that I did sigh dreamily with satisfaction. Everything comes to a head and no loose ends are left untied including secrets and deceptions. I can't tell you how frustrating it was wanting Deryn's secret out so I was happy to finally see it happen even though it wasn't quite in the way she had hoped. I loved reading the Author's Notes at the end about the real history that was included. To be honest, I didn't know much about World War One before reading the series and it was like an ingenious way to teach me some history. Who knew I could learn things out side of school? Amazing. And Scott definitely did his research. You can totally tell there was nothing half-done where that was concerned. This was probably my favorite book in the series and is my favorite steampunk of all time. If you haven't picked up this series please do so we can gush about it together. This finale book will be released September 20th!

Deryn Sharp, or Dylan Sharp as she like's to be called when she's in disguise, is a midshipman on Leviathan, an airship in Her Majesties Navy during the Great War. Flying has always been her dream and she wants to serve her country, which requires pretending to be a boy. Strength of Character? Deryn is so many things I admire in a person. She's brave enough to serve in the military and never shies away from danger. She's loyal to her friends, keeping their secrets even when it goes against orders, particularly Prince Alex heir to the Austrian throne. She manages to find the balance between her duty to her country and doing what's right for herself and her friends. Deryn's Storyline Deryn's story really gets underway in Leviathan when her airship crashes in the Swiss Alps. It's there she encounters our other protagonist Alek (a hero in his own right) when he tries to save the airship's crew from starvation in the glacial wilderness. From there they go on an adventure that spans the globe. From helping start a revolution in the Ottoman empire, to trying to avoid intrepid reporters in America, to fighting the Germans-- Deryn does it all and bravely. Romantic Entanglements This series has one of my favorite YA romances. For the most part it stays in the background. There's a war to fight, assassination attempts to avoid and a revolution to start. The characters don't ever forget what's important or their priorities. At the same time the book doesn't ignore that your feelings affect your decisions, especially in life and death situations. (view spoiler) [ When everything finally comes to fruition in Goliath it's done perfectly. The revelation that Dylan is actually a girl named Deryn is well done. Often these things are drawn out and painful. But Westerfeld created two intelligent main characters and allows them to figure it. He doesn't need to bang the characters (and the reader) over the head with the truth before they accept it. I don't think I've ever seen it done this well and I read a lot of girls pretending to be boys stories. For Alek and Deryn it always comes back to the friendship they've built, the loyalty and the trust. It's a relationship based on being intellectual equals and mutual admiration. They are both heroes and respect each other. (hide spoiler) ] Conclusions I feel like me and this series were meant to be together. The story of an alternative steampunk WWI, a girl dressed in boy clothes and a global adventure is just my style. This series is spectacular and highly recommended, especially if you like history. Deryn is near the top of heroines I love. She's brave, clever and such a loyal friend. She's the type of girl anyone would be fortunate to know. Right after I finished I tweeted about how I'd stayed up late to finish Goliath and that I loved it. Scott Westerfeld tweeted me back a link to some bonus material. Trust me it's worth having a look. http://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/2011/...

A pesar de que en esta entrega el romance y los sentimientos llevan a los personajes a tomar muchas de las decisiones mas importantes, no arruina la historia central, si no que la complementa bastante bien.

El final es magn\u00edfico, un poco abierto, lleno de posibilidades y con la certeza de que puede haber un mundo mejor. Y por eso el autor escribi\u00f3 un cap\u00edtulo extra, que sirve como epilogo y cierre para la trilog\u00eda. Este se sucede unas semanas despu\u00e9s del incidente del Goliath y nos relata una fiesta de a\u00f1o nuevo en la Sociedad Zool\u00f3gica de Londres.

La fiesta en cuesti\u00f3n es de disfraces, donde la mayor\u00eda ir\u00e1 disfrazada o de grandes cient\u00edficos o de bestias fabricadas.

El chico (ahora apellidado Hohenberg) trabaja ahora como agente especial de los darwinistas, al igual que Deryn, mientras que el conde Volger se ha quedado con \u00e9l, por su imposibilidad de regresar a su patria.

C\u00f3mo me gustar\u00eda que el autor continuara escribiendo sobre este par, ya sea sobre sus aventuras en la Sociedad Zool\u00f3gica o sobre la segunda guerra mundial.

I was very excited to read this but I didn't realize until halfway through (as the book seemed to simply \"I sure did like the first cover of Leviathan without the kids' faces on it more than these other ones.\" I do still agree that this cover doesn't hold a candle to the first book (before they put on the face) But this book in almost every other way is just as good, better in a few respects. Actually, it's been quite some time since I nearly cried at the end of a book simply because it was over. I was very excited to read this but I didn't realize until halfway through (as the book seemed to simply MELT into my brain I was reading so fast) how entirely un-ready I was for it to conclude. If I could kiss Scott Westerfield's feet for one reason only it would be that he never betrayed any of the characters or themes that we all adored. Maybe that is a pretty cynical view of story-telling at large on my part given that I always expect the things I love to be ruined by their own creators but I'm so jaded when it comes to falling in love with my heroes and heroines because there will always come a moment where the girl in drag gets stuffed into a corsett and dress or the dashing prince with a heavy concience gets petulant and whiney. This actually doesn't happen. I should think it's hardly a spoiler that Alek does discover Daeryn's secret but what is so shocking is that, unlike anything before it and most impressively unlike what the actual characters in the book predicted themselves, he deals quite well. He loses none of his integrity, doesn't dwell TOO much on the girl thing (aside from a few genuinely cute notions) and it doesn't get stupid dramatic. These two young characters have their entire relationship rocked to its foundation but the never forget they're still in the middle of a barking war. Additionaly, we NEVER find out how pretty Daeryn is. There is breif mention of the unfortunate existence of her breasts (from a practical stand-point) and otherwise the nicest compliment she gets (aside from valour) is that she makes quite a dashing boy. I simply cannot get over how supremely satisfied I feel right now. OH and of course the little stars of the show. When the Lorises first hatched in the second book I wasn't really sure what sort of tool they'd be to the story or how they'd be treated. Lets just say the Disney ages has taught me to be wary of talking animals. But they were perfect, adorable even. The two lorises may actually have been my favourite characters, and Westerfield did a fantastic job of including them JUST enough. They provided no major plotpoints but injected steady doses of entertainment in every scene and helped very much to paint us a mental picture for the moments that did not already have an illustration. Additionally they ARE important in a few ways and they always carry an air of mystery given that Alek basicaly owns one and does not entirely know just how smart they get. Looking back I guess you could argue that there is a little less action in this one, at least less important action. Even the final climactic scene feels a little muted compared to the Ottoman revolution. I guess I could consider this point a little negative. I also feel the final book used Tesla as just a tiny bit too much but I love the ultimate role he plaeyed. Finally and mostly I adored how the author treated our main characters. As I said, they were never ruined or betrayed and finally the fact that the two loved the adventure about as much as they loved each other, finally a novel with a love story that isn't the backbone of the characters' motivation. Normally I roll my eyes and scoff when an author decided to make a series longer than they planned (though on a whole I understand how stories can change when you get into them and it's not always possible to tell how long it will be) but in this case at the final pages continued melt before my eyes I found myself frequenting the front cover to verify that it does, indeed, say \"The conclusion of the Leviathan Trilogy\" And it does conclude...but I would be so happy to find out that he decided to do another trilogy in the same world following the leviathan story. ...more Goliath even the title hints at the effort I put into reading it... not necessarily a bad thing just different. Thinking back to Leviathan, I remember having shelved it; only catching on to what others saw half way through, my second time around with it. I'm used to 'give me fast and easy books', Leviathan and Behemoth are not any of those. Instead, I had to pace myself, pay a little more attention to Dylan's and Alek's world. It was a chore at first, for sure... but once the I'd grown accustome Goliath even the title hints at the effort I put into reading it... not necessarily a bad thing just different.

It was a chore at first, for sure... but once the I'd grown accustomed to set pace, there was no way I wouldn't see it through. Fast forward to Goliath, and I still got the same feeling of 'I must read carefully.' Because, yes, I couldn't rush through it for fear of missing something big. OK so after much thought, I'm going to say that I'm happy where things ended. I really didn't know what I wanted to happen. Prior to reading, I'd imagined the reveals done in the most shocking manner; I'd imagined someone being heartbroken; I'd even considered something tragic taking place. I'd also wondered where the story would take me in terms of them as a couple. Would there be a couple? Would there be an HEA? Did I really want an HEA? Especially since I'd lauded/praised/raved about how different Deryn/Dylan was from her peers with her tough and independent manner? Did I want her girl side to show up? I mean, her girly side was showing with the hints of crushes and love-unlikely. But... did I want an HEA? Or would going there take away the what made Leviathan and Behemoth different? Anyhoot, I am happy with how things turned out: Dylan/Deryn is still tough and goal oriented. Alek had reverted to the Alek he was in Leviathan, the boy playing at being soldiers because upon his return he was feeling a tad out of place and functionless... and suspicious. Things got even more complicated with the introduction of a new character who'd been alluded to in the previous books: Tesla. The war between the Clankers vs Darwinists is still in full throttle, but the best thing about this aspect of the story was how it affected Alec. He was so conflicted about his place. There's a lot of indecision from him. To trust or not? To Love or not? To Reveal or not? This last installment manages to strike a balance between action and emotion. 4/5 Thank you Simon & Schuster! ...more There are a lot of books that I love and a lot of series I'm especially fond of. But it takes a special book and a special series to give me the kind of massive book hangover I received after reading the final pages of Goliath . You guys, I love this series so effing much.

Scott Westerfeld has created a world that I want to live in; a world I wish had really come about instead of this one (no offense to this world, but guys, there is an airship that is an entire ecosystem of living creatures HOLY CRAP). And even though this world is freaking super awesome, I don't know if it would have had the same appeal if it weren't for the incredible characters through whose eyes I got to experience this world. Deryn Sharp, oh my god. I love her to pieces. I want to know her and be friends with her and then brag to everyone about how I'm friends with her because she is the BEST. I mean, it's no wonder ... well, I won't go throwing any spoilers out there. But the point is, she is clever and capable and hilarious and noble and filled with the kind of derring-do that I wish I could strum up within myself. She is the best kind of character. The rest of the cast is equally colorful and I really experienced them as people, not plot points. The turmoil and situations that popped up were only predictable in that I felt like I knew these characters so well I could tell what they would choose to do next. That is the best kind of character writing. The story was brilliant, all the way through, and I struggled with wanting to gobble it up and wanting to slowly savor it. (In the end, I read the last 250 pages in one day because I couldn't help myself.) It's rare for me to put a book on my favorites shelf, and even rarer that each book within a series gets put on that shelf.

As I was gushing about the book, my husband commented, \"Wouldn't it be more interesting if Alek lost interest in Deryn because she's a girl?\" It was a joke, but it made me realize that Alek actually does really like Deryn as a boy. And their relationship will likely always have elements of Deryn's masculine persona. And there's never any doubt that it's ok. Alek (to our knowledge) never grapples with falling in love with someone he thought was a boy for several months. How radical and amazing is that? (Very.) Also, the final full-page illustration? Yeah. That sums up my entire review on this issue. ...more A breathtaking finale to the Leviathan series! I thoroughly enjoyed this finely crafted novel. Part adventure story, part alternate history, part political intrigue, part romance, part coming-of-age drama.... 100% awesome! :-) I continued to enjoy our returning characters and found the new additions to the cast interesting and/or amusing.

Deryn persisted in growing on me, and Alek in impressing me (I probably would have had a major crush on him if I'd read this as a tween). One aspect of the conclusion seemed a bit out of character for Alek, and didn't sit quite right with me in consequence, though I think it could be justified--I just wish a bit more had been explained in the story itself. Still, the conclusion was quite fitting, overall, and I like thinking about the future for the characters (and wish there was more to read about them!!!) I won't say too much about the plot as there would be spoilers not only for this book but also for the previous ones; I did appreciate the new destinations in this journey (including Russia and the United States) and had fun when real characters from history stepped into the pages. The Afterward, as always, proved interesting in sorting out fact from fiction and in revealing some of Westerfield's purposes for altering history when he did. I was also pleased that there wasn't as much violence with the Darwinist creatures as I'd feared, though a few parts were a bit disquieting. Still, all in all I loved this book and highly recommend the entire series. I'm so grateful to my sister for recommending the first book, and it was fun to read the last one at the same time she was. ...more This trilogy has been very up and down for me. The first book grabbed me because of the vivid world, with its rival steampunk Clankers and genetically-altered Darwinist creatures. The characters didn't appeal to me that much. That changed in the second book, as Alek and Deryn each grew up in different ways. My initial thought of the third book? It's long.

That changed in the second book, as Alek and Deryn each grew up in different ways. My initial thought of the third book? It's long. It feels unnecessarily dragged out so that it can show half of the planet and cameos of famous people of the 1910s, though I did appreciate the appearance of a steampunked-up Hearst Castle. But instead of enjoying their adventures, I found myself impatient for it to move on with the main plot.[return][return]A few of the big plot twists at the end were predictable far in advance if you have any knowledge of history, especially the singular event in Siberia in 1908. I was also disappointed that the delightful lorises didn't have more of a role in the ending. These creatures stole the show in the past two books and with their brilliant nature, I thought that they had some important role in the main plot. Alas, they ended up as witty sidekicks more than anything.[return][return]The big point of resolution here was the angst between Deryn and Alek. That took up quite a bit of space but overall was handled well. Of course, the story had to have a happy ending in that regard.[return][return]I'm not sure if I will keep these books on my shelf. I still think I enjoyed the setting more than the characters. Well, and I loved the perspicacious lorises, too. ...more Scott Westerfeld is a genius. Even if you can't find it in yourself to enjoy the complex, rollercoaster ride of a plot, you should still consider the depth of his research, the witty originality of his characters, and the VERY high quality of the fangirl moments he provides in this conclusion to the Leviathan trilogy. I LOVED this book. Illustrations by Keith Thompson make it all the more steampunk-fantastic. Recommended to everyone aged 10-247. http://www.rantingdragon.com/review-o...

Goliath is the concluding volume in Scott Westerfeld\u2019s Leviathan trilogy, a young adult series that follows an alternate World War I with steampunk elements. In Goliath, Alek and Deryn have left the Ottoman Empire aboard the Leviathan in order to pick up a mysterious new passenger deep in the heart of Siberia. At the behest of this passenger, they proceed to travel across the world on a journey to New York, where the possibility of a deadly new weapon called Goliath awaits\u2014a weapon that could potentially bring an end to the war\u2026but at the price of millions of innocent lives. Around the world While Leviathan and Behemoth took place in relatively small areas (a glacier in the Alps and Istanbul, respectively), Goliath broadens the scope of the series considerably. The Leviathan travels the world in this installment, taking Alek and Deryn to Russia, Japan, Mexico, and America. They meet an assortment of fascinating characters along the way, many of whom, such as William Randolph Hearst and \u201cPancho\u201d Villa, actually existed in the early 20th century. These characters are all interesting and provide neat anchors to the real world, but it sometimes feels as though Westerfeld creates excessive tangents simply for the sake of meeting these real-life characters. Alek and Deryn take a backseat to actual historical figures far more than is necessary in Goliath, and the story grinds to a halt every time they do. Just going through the motions Goliath doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of surprises. The story\u2019s predictability goes from being annoying to a major flaw, and this proves to be a serious detriment considering that Goliath is the longest entry in the Leviathan trilogy. Everything that was established in the first two books comes to fruition in Goliath, but nothing happens in even a remotely surprising way. More than anything, it feels as if Westerfeld is simply going through the motions rather than trying to create an actual plot. Predictably, Deryn\u2019s secret begins to leak out, complicating her relationship with Alek, and Alek himself becomes more and more obsessed with the idea that he is destined to put an end to the war. The perspicuous lorises bring humor to the book but don\u2019t really serve the story, and Dr. Barlow continues to remain more of a plot device than a character. And of course, the inevitable romance between Alek and Deryn finally surfaces, only to feel extraordinarily forced. There isn\u2019t a shred of romantic chemistry between these two characters, and the romantic subplot between them seems to exist more out of obligation than out of any genuine attraction. A story that lacks intensity Simply put, Goliath lacks conflict. The majority of the book consists of the Leviathan traveling across the world, encountering new cultures and meeting new people. In many ways, this feels like a reflection of the story itself: it lacks the focus of the first two installments and instead meanders aimlessly, touching on numerous potential conflicts and storylines but abandoning them just as quickly. Furthermore, the war\u2014which is, essentially, the driving force of the series\u2014always feels distant and irrelevant. While in the previous novels the characters were constantly fighting for their lives, throughout most of Goliath their biggest worries consist of petty personal problems. The characters rarely feel like they\u2019re in any real danger, and this results in a dull story that stretches over 500-plus pages. Frankly, Goliath was boring. The lack of conflict shows through in Keith Thompson\u2019s illustrations as well: while they remain as beautiful as ever, the exciting battles and life-threatening moments that he captured in the first two books give way mostly to drawings of settings and characters standing around talking. I breezed through Leviathan and Behemoth because the stories were intense and exciting, but I honestly struggled through Goliath; I probably would have given up on it if I hadn\u2019t already invested the time to read the first two installments. Even the book\u2019s climax was, frankly, anticlimactic; to make matters worse, it strays dangerously close to deus ex machina territory. After everything that Alek and Deryn go through in the Leviathan series, the resolution of the story and their characters feels cheap and unsatisfying. Why should you read this book? If you\u2019ve read Leviathan and Behemoth, you\u2019re probably going to want to finish the series. There\u2019s no harm in doing so if you\u2019ve got the time, but be warned that Goliath may be a disappointment after the first two entries in the series. It lacks the intensity and excitement of the previous installments, and the novelty of the Clanker machines and the Darwinist \u201cbeasties\u201d that originally gave Westerfeld\u2019s take on World War I a unique twist has worn off by this point in the series. Ultimately, Goliath fails to live up to its predecessors and proves to be disappointing conclusion to a promising series. ...more First and foremost I must say that Ed is awesome as he went to the NYC book expo, and then got up at 5:45am in order to make sure that I not only got an Advanced Readers copy but a personalized signed one.

Ed, YOU ROCK! Now onto the book. I quite enjoyed Goliath . I floundered a bit in the beginning because it's been a while since I read the first book and since I wasn't expecting to get this one, I wasn't prepared. (It also doesn't help that the first 2 books are at my boyfriend's and I didn't have access to them.) However, that withstanding it was a great book. As always, I marvel at the world Westerfield has created here and now that the story is done I wish there was more set in this universe. Perhaps even a WWII series, I don't know. I liked how the US was divided in Clanker and Darwinist due to the civil war and it makes sense that the north would be Clanker with the steam revolution and coal mines. BUT somehow the south being Darwinist doesn't make that much sense to me as a good portion of the south believes in creationism. But for the sake of the story, it works. This book is a bit different than the others as it seems to feature more real-life characters, both major and minor, as well as actual technologies that were available at the time. It seemed to ground the story a bit more in history and have it depart from alternate-history fantasy. While each element has its place, I felt that the majesty of the fantastic that was present in the first 2 books was a bit lost here. Also, I think Dylan / Deryn's secret was flaunted a bit much. I know it had to come to a head here and people learn the truth. But there was no need for the Mexican general to know really and the admission to Dr. Barlow felt a little flat. Although I understand this later admission due to her current position. As far as the conclusion, while I really like the final scene with Alek and Deryn, I'm not sure I believe Alek's actions regarding his family position. I wont' say too much to spoil the story but the move seemed a bit out of character without enough build up for it. It is because of what Alek does in the final chapter that makes the ending feel rushed to me. I would have liked to see him grappling with his decision more throughout the book, or perhaps it occurs to him at the end of this book and then there's a fourth book where he grapples with it and decides what to do. Alot of things / people and ideas were introduced in Goliath and could have been expanded more. The ending works as is, but it still feels too rushed, too pat to me. Not just with Alek but the situation with the world in general. I would rather see some of the things mentioned in the last chapter than be told about them. All in all I think a fourth book would have rounded it out neater. However, I understand why Westerfield left off where he did and the ending would have been more satisfying if it had been led up to better. Or perhaps if not quite so many elements were introduced this late in the game. My complaints on the ending aside I really liked the series and it is a wonderful conclusion. I am sad to see that this seems to be the end of this world as it is one of the most unique I have run across. I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who likes steampunk, alternate history, science or even just a good war / action/adventure story. ...more Ok, guys let\u2019s give Mr. Westerfeld a big round of applause for a stellar ending for his amazing series.

Oh gosh, I\u2019m gonna miss these two! And Bovril, how could I forget this one, I\u2019m still hearing this little guy saying \u2018Mr. Sharp!\u2019 There are things I\u2019ve been looking forward as the series wrap up. One, I wanted to know how the war will end, particularly the effect of it to Alek\u2019s future. Two, well, Alek\u2019s future, will he or will not take the throne? And finally, the one million dollar question, how Alek will know Deryn\u2019s true identity. So, did my questions have been answered now that I got the chance to finish it? It\u2019s a yes, and a no. YES, because it did answer my questions, and NO, because the ending was a bit different than I expected. It wasn\u2019t as solid as I wish it would be. But I\u2019m not really complaining about it. In hindsight, I actually preferred the ending and wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. For me to like the series this much, says a lot about this book\u2019s charm. I really don\u2019t like history, and this series had tons of historical elements. But the author is pure genius, how he put these elements together is rich, vibrant and highly enjoyable. Plus the amazing illustrations by Keith Thompson help me savor this book at its finest. Another thing that I\u2019ve been excited to know is their visit to Japan. I\u2019m kinda disappointed (just tiny bit though) that they didn\u2019t stay that long. But as a consolation, they visit a few more cities before they their last stop, which in New York. Man oh man, Alek did a big decision there! Never imagined he\u2019ll choose that path. As in never. We all know that Alek will eventually know Deryn\u2019s secret. I have already this clich\u00e9 scenario in my head. But Westerfeld outsmart me, I mean I never would have thought that. I really liked it actually. What excites me the most about this part, besides the how of the revealing, was the reaction of these two after that. Well? That was the fun part. It was a smart play of things. A large part of the book is about the two of them working things out now that the truth is out in the open. I liked that Alek and Deryn remained consistent with their characters. Frankly, I was little apprehensive that it\u2019ll change them. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re still the characters I learned to love, but relationship-wise, something did stir up after that. ;) Well, I did say I liked the ending. But I got two words for you! BARKING SPIDERS! With that, I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. I still can\u2019t believe it. It ended. *cries* Goliath toppled my expectations to the ground. I loved it!! Steampunk goodness, luscious historical ideas and amazing characters all in one incredible series! And for that I\u2019d like to thank to Scott Westerfeld and Keith Thompson for an amazing journey. What are you waiting for? If you loved and enjoyed the first two books \u2013 grab a copy and read this one now! ...more I might be in the minority, but I found Behemoth lackluster compared to Leviathan .

Deryn and Alek are back aboard the Leviathan with some familiar faces--Dr. Nora Barlow, Count Volger, the adorable Bovril, with some cameos from Lillit and Eddie Malone. Also, some new faces: Adela Rodgers, the girl journalist, Pancho Villa, a leader in the Mexican Revolution, and of course, the famous and notorious Nikola Tesla. It's no surprise that this globe-hopping final installment is full of fun fact intermingled with history and adventure (Westerfeld's afterword is a must-read). My only complaint about this book (and the first two) is entirely personal--it seems a bit young and breezy for such heavy themes like war. But oh, it's fun. Really, really fun. Perfect for younger teens or even older ones, though the right hit would be from 10-14. (Also, you know how **SPOILER FOR THE FIRST TWO BOOKS** Deryn is cross-dressing as a boy? And that she's in love with Alek? Well, I knew from the beginning of the series that those two were OTP. I was worried there would be too much pining on Deryn's behalf and a load of Alek being the dumb boy, Deryn is way too BAMF to pine and Alek is way too princely to be unobservant. I definitely aww'ed a few times and grinned out loud.) ...more I was going to give this 4 stars, but then I started Nine Princes of Amber and I thought, \"This...this is what 4 + star books are made of\". So I'm giving it 3 instead. Don't get me wrong, Westerfeld has created a wonderful and well researched alternative history world. His novels are well written and his ideas well thought out. But, his books just lack something. They're soulless. I don't feel anything for the characters or for their situations. Sure the descriptions are detailed, the paragraphs I was going to give this 4 stars, but then I started Nine Princes of Amber and I thought, \"This...this is what 4 + star books are made of\".

But, his books just lack something. They're soulless. I don't feel anything for the characters or for their situations. Sure the descriptions are detailed, the paragraphs properly edited and the characters well rounded, but it's just like a perfect looking meal with no spices or flavor. As a whole, this was an ok series. I can see why people adore it as Westerfeld has obviously put a lot of effort to create Leviathan's world but it didn't blow me away. I'd have preferred some more emotional dialogue instead of endless descriptions of mechanical devices/animal devices and scampering across the Leviathan scenes. This series was cute but I'm happy to finally be done with it. Would I recommend it? Not really. ...more Well, I've read this book and now my life is complete.

I love these books like crazy and I couldn't wait for the conclusion. And it was by far the best book in the series. It's an excellent, exciting, and gripping conclusion to a wildly creative series. This book delivers what all the fans want: action, adventure, humor, and a love story like no other. The thick volume goes over quite a bit, completing the around the world trip in this alternate version of earth where amazing machines and beasts lurk. And there's always enough action and intrigue supplied to keep readers turning pages. Alek and Deryn are chased by bears as tall as houses in Russia, experience unique dining in Japan, ride on top of the airship in the middle of a hurricane, attend fancy banquets, and star in Hearst's motion pictures. There was never a dull moment. And all the beautiful illustrations captured the text and made it visual, it really brought the book to life. It was a bit crazy of course, I think there was enough going on that Goliath could have been split into two books instead of having one massive series-ender. But it was fine all the same. The battle scenes, as always, were well done, plus the illustrations keep you from getting confused. Since everything in the series is based on an alternate version of World War I, it doesn't always match actual history, but there's plenty of historical fact and characters incorporated. We meet actual historical figures, such as the crazy Nikola Tesla, girl reporter Adela Rogers, newspaper and film mogul William Randolph Hearst, and Mexican Revolution leader Poncho Villa. The book has an Afterwards where Westerfeld explains fact from fiction. Another element that was overall well done was Alek and Deryn's complicated relationship. I can't stand reading straight-up romance, so I liked that it wasn't overly focused on, since this is a book about war. How he found out that she was a girl was really interesting and unpredictable, and how it played out afterwards was pretty awesome. But it was really well crafted, and at times utterly sweet. Their transition from best friends to soul mates was carried on well without overkill, and it definitely builds upon the story. The ending was nice, even though I wish things were slightly more explained. This wasn't vital, but it would have been appreciated. Then again, we can pretty much assume what happens... Overall an outstanding way to end a best-selling trilogy. I'm so sad it's over! ...more Ja n\u00e4in upea Leviathan -trilogia on saatu p\u00e4\u00e4t\u00f6kseen.
