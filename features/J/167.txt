Terror. The strengthening sense that something was very, very wrong. As with The Magicians , I have to confess I like the TV series Wayward Pines far better than the book. Yes, I know the \"reveal\" has been spoiled, but that really wasn't my problem with it. Pines is built on a fantastic idea - no, really, a truly epic idea - and that strength just about manages to carry the book despite some poor writing, an asshole protagonist, and an exceptional lack of diversity that, given the situation, has even more troubling implications than usual. Coming into this book after watching the show definitely affects how you view it. It's impossible not to notice how every woman becomes hot or \"cute\". And the pearly-whiteness of the cast of characters practically glows from the pages. Perhaps I wouldn't have picked up on it if I hadn't already seen a diverse cast in the show, but it was like coming to a lesser, whitewashed version of the story I've come to love. The plot is really very compelling. Special Agent Ethan Burke is involved in an accident on his way into Wayward Pines, Idaho - a place where two missing agents were last supposed to be. He awakes in a hospital without his personal belongings and with no way to contact his boss or family. Right away, something feels wrong. Everyone is friendly but they all seem reluctant to help him make contact with anyone outside the town. It's engaging because Ethan's situation is genuinely frightening . The need to know what the hell is going on keeps the pages turning or the episodes playing; even reading the book knowing the truth, there was a knot in the pit of stomach as I imagined being in Ethan's situation. It's weird, it's creepy, it's a lot of mind-boggling fun. But the TV show is better . The book is written in a very simplistic way, which may not seem like a terrible thing, but it is noticeably juvenile - I'm not usually someone to notice the writing unless it is very good or very bad, and this one I picked up on right away. As well as the writing issues and the whiteness, Ethan Burke is far less likable in Pines . Maybe if he'd been more developed and complex, instead of just mindlessly arrogant and annoying, I would have liked him despite his flaws. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. So I will say that this story is great and you should experience it. However, I think the best way to experience it is on your TV screen. And that's not something I usually say.

Enroute he is in a \u201ccar accident\u201d which kills the agent that was sent with him and lands him in the hospital. He has memory issues. Burke escapes from the hospital, which was starting to feel more like a prison, and wanders around the town. There is a distinct \u201cyou aren\u2019t from around\u201d here vibe coming from the inhabitants of this town. A Children of the Corn creepiness that is hard to ignore. He meets a friendly bartender who gives him her address in case he needs a place to stay. It is hard to even buy a cup of coffee without his wallet which has mysteriously disappeared.

By this time it doesn\u2019t surprise Ethan that Sheriff Pope acts strange. Everyone in this town acts scared, acts peculiar. They act like people do when something is very, very wrong. The phones don\u2019t work, and then when they do, he gets the voicemail of his wife. She never calls him back. He tries to check into work and gets this person that is about as helpful as a tree of feces throwing monkeys. He decides to steal a car and leave town. Every road out of town brings you back to Wayward Pines. When he goes into the woods to explore, he finds a large electrified fence encircling the town. He hears: \u201d The scream could only be compared to human suffering or terror. Like a hyena or a banshee. Coyotes at their maddest. The mythologized Rebel Yell. High and thin. Fragile. Terrible. And on some level, humming under the surface liked buried electrical cables, was a dim awareness that this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d heard it. Again, the scream .\u201d He finds Kate, but not the Kate he was expecting. He finds Kate who is fifteen years older than when he last saw her a few weeks ago. She is married to a man named Harold. He can\u2019t believe what he sees. \u201dAre you losing your mind? You tell me. I can\u2019t. Why? Because I am you.\u201d Kate is cryptic, but tells him that he is not crazy. Something he desperately needs to hear given the fact that absolutely nothing has made sense in this town since he woke up in a hospital bed. There are cameras and microphones everywhere. He finds a box that makes the soothing, normal sounds of crickets. In the immortal words of Kevin Bacon in the movie Tremors : \u201dWhat the hell is going on? I mean what the hell is going on.\u201d There is a big twist, and I am not going to talk about the BIG TWIST because some of you might want to read the book or watch the excellent TV series by M. Night Schyamalan. The series was must see TV for my family every Thursday night. The casting was excellent with Matt Dillon, Carla Gugino, Shannyn Sossamon (I was really glad to see her. I haven\u2019t seen much of her since she starred in the double movies with Heath Ledger: Knight\u2019s Tale and The Order .), and Toby Jones as the creepy David Pilcher. I watched the series before reading the book. There are differences for sure. There were a couple of scenes in the book that I found more compelling than the ones in the series, but for the most part the series outperforms the book. It is not really a fair comparison because the series covered what I think are all three books in the trilogy. This first book ends at about maybe three episodes into the series. Normally, I will read the book before watching a TV adaptation or a movie, but in this case the series kind of snuck up on me. Not hard to do with my face in a book all the time. :-) I plan to read the rest of the Pines series mainly because I\u2019m interesting in where Schyamalan deviates from <---A>Blake Crouch</---A>. For instance, in the book Ethan is having flashbacks to the war and the torture he experienced while captured. That was left out of the TV series. I thought it was a good decision. This series is an ode to Twin Peaks . Crouch remembers vividly the impact that TV show had on him in his pre-teen years. When it was cancelled, he was so distraught that he wrote a season three. I hope he is excited about the return of Twin Peaks which I believe is slated for 2016. There are certainly Twin Peaks elements to this series, enhanced by a really good twist. David Lynch\u2019s inspiring series created a writer out of Blake Crouch. I can only hope that the Wayward Pines series sparks a dormant creative gene in some other pre-teen who will grow up to write an ode to Wayward Pines .

At least 75% of the novel is an exercise in describing physical activity - running, climbing, fighting, hiding, and then more running. Our protagonist, Ethan Burke, knows there's something wrong in the town of Wayward Pines, but doesn't put a lot of thought into finding out what it might be. Instead, he reacts through most of the book, getting bounced from one place to another, captured again and again without becoming any the wiser as to what lies beneath the surface, save by information fed to him by a mysterious ally within the town named Beverly. The last 10% of the book is pure exposition, with an ending that will take you by surprise because it feels like Crouch had no idea how to end or explain the book until then. Far from satisfying, it leaves the reader scratching his head with all the logical holes and plot points he chooses to ignore. Dialogue (as most of the book centers on a man on the run) is held at a minimum, and what little of it there is feels clumsy or canned. This being the case, I'd hope to find a lot more interior dialogue than Crouch offers; thoughts and investigatory theories formed and discarded by the protagonist (a trained Secret Service agent) rather than descriptions of him running down an alley or up a staircase, reporting only what he sees and seldom what he thinks. In an afterward, the author credits David Lynch's 'Twin Peaks' as a source of inspiration for the novel and, reading the sales description, I was put in mind of both 'Twin Peaks' and 'The X-Files'. I'm disappointed to say that this book wasn't much like either. ...more Secret Service agent Ethan Burke wakes up in the mountain town of Wayward Pines, his memory full of holes aside from that of a horrific car wreck that landed him in the hospital.

Thus begins his quest to figure out what happened to him and how to get home to his wife and son. Along the way, he encounters mystery and resistance... almost like he's not meant to understand what's going on... Dun dun dunnnnnnn! This didn't start on the greatest foot - with the very Koontzish (1) waking up with no memory thing and the M/C having a migraine as described by someone who's never actually experienced one, and the uber-nice Nurse Pam - but after a bit, it started to pick up. This is definitely a quick read, and the mysteriousness of everything was enough to keep me going. I liked Ethan, and I liked Beverly, and I was interested in finding out whether my theories about the story were right or not. And some were, and some were close, but not quite right, and some were wayyyyyyyyyy off-base. But, now that I'm done with the book, and now that there's been an explanation of the ons that were going, I have to say that I liked a lot of individual pieces of this book, but as a whole it didn't work for me. This is one of those ideas books, where there are a shitton of great ideas, but none of them really mesh together with each other and instead feel like a mishmash of unfulfilled greatness. I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this, but don't worry, I shall elaborate and explain why I feel like that. Consider this your electrified fence. Proceed past this point at your own spoiler risk. First, the creepy \"perfect\" town thing has kind of been done to death. It's never as perfect as it seems, and there's always something hidden. To be honest, Nurse Pam should have been my first clue we were dealing with one of those places, but meeting her so early threw me off. Plus it did seem normal at first, and only got more and more abnormal as the story progressed. Kudos there for keeping me on my toes. But then, when we find out what Wayward Pines is... it just doesn't make sense. I mean, this place is, at least according to Pilcher, the last vestiges of humanity, created when he discovered that humanity was changing due to environmental changes, and that the rest of the human population, in the span of 30 generations, would evolve, or devolve rather, to a more primitive form which would be more adapted to the hostile environment that we helped create with our factories and our CFCs and our nuclear meltdowns and our fossil fuel burning and our general stupid humanness. Oh, and we're also gonna be translucent, vicious carnivores with razor sharp talons and we'll run like wolves. Now, I am no evolutionary biologist, but I really don't think it works like that. He's talking about macroevolution, and that takes a long damn time. Millions of years, not hundreds, or thousands. So... I'm not buying it. And I'm especially not buying that the discovery of it was made early enough to have already sunk billions into R&D for suspended animation, and the mass production of the suspension tanks, as well as for the town to be fortified and stocked and ready for inhabitation by 1982, which is two years before planning even started for the Human Genome Project. I mean, sure, maybe Pilcher was ahead of his time. But then I think that he has been kidnapping people and \"integrating\" them into his perfect little town for 50 years... and during this time he kept totally mum about the fate of the almost 7 billion OTHER people on the planet. Nothing said about letting anyone in government know what he'd discovered, or anyone in the scientific community (And I have to wonder... was his research peer reviewed?), or even his own family. He just started taking people, and his psychotic brain assured him that he was the savior of humanity in its \"pure human\" form. Nice. It doesn't seem like he really wanted to save people at all... it seems like he saw an opportunity for playing god, and took it, even if he's only god to a couple hundred people, and they don't really know that he's the one behind the curtain. Which makes me wonder... what happens when he dies? Who will man the watchtowers then? So... coming back to the town. We now know that WP is that last refuge of humanity... only there's not that much humanity to be found there. Everyone lives a lie - no talking about the outside world, no talking about history, etc. But then, when someone strays from the rules, they are punished, severely. The entire town, children included, are rallied into a bloodthirsty mob and they beat the offender to death. Because that's how we're DIFFERENT from the creatures we became. Wait. What I mean to say is that we're still pretty and wear clothes and pretend like we are civilized (when we're not mob killing the nonconformist) so that makes us better than our see-thru evolutionary siblings who just act out of instinct and hunger. The reasoning that Pilcher gives for this murderous mob culture is quite possibly the lamest I've ever seen. His response, that it's nothing new, and that if violence is the norm, people will adapt to it, while true, doesn't really explain WHY that has to be the norm. Oh, self-policing, Pilcher? Yeah, that's not self-policing. They aren't seeing someone do something against the rules and making a citizen's arrest to stop them from doing it. They are being woken in the middle of the night and being told who to hunt down and brutally kill. Leetle bit different. I mean, at least kowtow to the idea that participating in murder with the rest of the town fosters a sense of community, of single-mindedness, of protecting the herd, or whatever. Or say that there's a smaller risk of a group rising up to challenge the enforcers if the whole town is involved in the enforcing. But his reasoning is idiotic. I mean, according to him, he spent BILLIONS of dollars setting up this project, to save less than a thousand lives... and now whenever anyone breaks the rules, if they can't be mindmelded back into submission, he just has the townspeople kill them. Because hey, it's not like he did all this to save humanity or anything. *eye roll* I think it was more along the lines that Blake Crouch needed something to up the ante, and a murderous mob seemed like a good idea at the time. A couple more things about the town before I move on. It's never explicitly mentioned, but it seems that it would be hard to sell the idea of this being a normal town, even one with bizarre rules regarding what can and can't be talked about, when people keep appearing and then disappearing, and then reappearing with no memories at all from the last time they were there. Pilcher mentions that it's Ethan's 3rd go at being introduced to the town. But... after the town encounters this guy, he disappears and then shows up again several years later, don't you think they'd wonder what the hell is going on? And furthermore, how do you sell an entire town that almost every one of them just woke up next to the river with no memories of how they got there? You'd have to do it one or two at a time, and wouldn't THEY wonder about why there are no people there? Wouldn't they think it's odd that every couple days or weeks someone else just shows up fresh from their car crash coma? Wouldn't they think it odd that they are then told to just move on with their lives like they've lived there forever? I just don't see how this would work... They'd know that they were living in some crazy world that isn't quite right. They've only been out of stasis for 14 years - not long enough for the memories of past lives to have gone away... they just live in a constant state of fear that if they don't pretend to love Pleasantville, they'll be hunted down and killed as well. Some great life you built here, Pilcher. So, those are my big issues with the book. Some of my other issues include, but are not limited to, the following: First... The timeline. Ugh. This could have been better handled. It mostly bothered me toward the beginning of the book, and in hindsight, it makes sense how the amount of time someone would be in WP could be a little... wonky. But while reading this, it didn't work for me. We start the book with Ethan waking up, and trying to figure things out. Then, we skip over to his wife, who is having a funeral ceremony for him, even though he's only missing. I immediately disliked her for this, because in my mind, Ethan's only been missing a day or two, and it seems like she's given up on him super quickly and that kinda makes her a heartless bitch. But then she reveals, midway through her deathday party, that it's really been 14 months since he's been gone. Uhhh, why couldn't that have led the section? It seems to me that if it had, I would have been more sympathetic towards her, AND more worried about Ethan. But because of the way that the info was doled out, it didn't heighten the suspense or worry that I had for Ethan, because it was feasible that he might still find a way out of this weird creeper town. Secondly, holy sentence fragments, Batman! (2) \"Just before the top, one of the holds broke loose and he nearly lost his balance. Caught himself before he fell. He could feel the wind streaming across the opening to the chute. Glimpsed something catching sunlight straight above. Froze. Looked down. He\u2019d almost blown the chance to save himself. With the monster fifteen feet away and two more trailing close behind it in the chute, Ethan reached down, the loose handhold that had nearly killed him just within reach. He tore the chunk of rock from its housing, hoisted it over his head. It was a handful, even bigger than he\u2019d thought\u2014two pounds of quartz-laced granite. He wedged himself between the rock, took aim, and let it fly. It struck the creature dead center of its face just as it was reaching for a new handhold. Its grip failed. It plunged down the chute. Talons scraping rock. Its velocity too great to self-arrest.\" Also, you might have also noticed the tense flipping there. It plunged down the chute in past tense, but the talons were scraping rock in present tense. Lot of that going on as well. Third, there were a lot of unconscious memories stirring around in Ethan's head, and every once in a while there'd be a real-world bit fighting its way in. These memories are always italicized, and the real-world bits should not have been. It might be a nitpick, but I think it makes it clearer and easier to follow that the voice-that-is-not-part-of-the-memory is coming from outside his head, and thus is separate from the memories. So... Yeah. I wish I could say that I loved this one like everyone else. But I had far too many problems with it. It was a fun read, if one isn't bothered by the fragments or tense-blurring, and it went really quickly, so that was good, but overall, it just didn't really work for me. 1.Yeah, he's a bestselling author, but it's not a complimentary comparison from me. 2.That was my actual e-book note. ...more Wow.

Now, this is a situation that would scare the shit out of anyone, don't you agree? From page one my brain was reeling, faced with so many unanswered questions that I couldn't help but strongly sympathize with him : what defines who you are? Who would you be if every knowledge about yourself had been ripped off your mind? To what degree can you trust your instincts? Can they be right? Or are you going completely out of line? And even if your memories come back, how can you survive when you're surrounded by secrets? \"Are you losing your mind? I sometimes think I'm still in that torture room. I never left. Are you losing your mind? You tell me. I can't. Why? Because I am you.\" Who is to be believed? Who is to be trusted? \u25a9 The characters... are interesting and intriguing. When it comes to thrillers, I've drawn this conclusion : more the author keeps us in the dark, characters wise, more my interest is piqued, because the lack of knowledge adds tension to the story and you know what? I NEED TENSION. He isn't a likeable character, not flawless by any means, but I cared for his quest of answers, even more because the layers of his life aren't immediately unraveled. I won't say much about him... Because obviously : if my enjoyment was linked to the fact that I had no idea of what I could expect, I won't be the person that screw your read^^ As for the other characters we meet... What, though? \u25a9 The settings ... are quite ominous. Imagine a little town lost between mountains, with no escape in sight. Creepy, right? I mean, probably wonderful if you've planned a trip with friends, but to wake up there alone and in a bad shape? I'd probably turn hysterical. Nobody wants to see that , trust me. Even more when we realize, along the male-lead, that something isn't quite right there... The people... The places... Everything appears intriguing and yes, more and more frightening... \u25a9 The writing... is all kinds of amazing : indeed the alternative use of short and long sentences compelled me to read more and more and more, not to mention that some vivid descriptions (including smells! Thank you!) are straight on beautiful. I know many readers complained about the fragmented sentences and I can understand their struggles but... I think it's only a matter of taste : I love that kind of writing when it's well-done and it was perfect to express the changes in the rythm in my opinion. From start to finish, Pines never gets dull and ends with a punch, leaving me eager for more. \u25ba So, Anna, you're telling us that this book is perfect ? Huh, NO. Plot holes, anyone? Obviously, I won't talk about them because spoilers , but know that there are several of them and I. Don't. Care. I don't want to analyze : I was mesmerized, I was surprised, I am in love and I don't give a damn if some things don't quite make sense. You've been warned. Ps. Alright.

Desperate now to get out of Wayward Pines, Ethan steals a vehicle but no matter which route he takes it would seem that all roads lead back to Wayward Pines.

I really do not want to say too much, since if you have not yet read this or seen the excellent TV series it is best that you wade into these waters with as little knowledge as possible. I will say that it kept me furiously turning pages, scratching my head and on the edge of my seat. \u00a0The big reveals as you start turning into the home lap are masterfully handled, effectively closing out this chapter of the story and leaving you nail biting, anxious to start the next book in the trilogy. Blake Crouch says that he was inspired to write this by David Lynch\u2019s iconic television series Twin Peaks which aired when he was twelve years old. \u00a0We can only hope that Mr. Crouch\u2019s work will also someday inspire a future writer.

Therefore I intend to keep this review spoiler free, but I can't guarantee that certain judgements I make won't foreshadow events in the book. It is entirely safe to proceed reading through this first paragraph in case you need your fix of my reviews, but there won't be much to see except for something you probably already guessed given my warning: the biggest strength of this story is its supremely intriguing mystery. The plot is a perpetually thickening fog and the fast pace is your only hope of getting out of it. Frantic page-turning ensues. I'm assuming some of you have continued reading beyond the paragraph break because, much like half of the Goodreads population, you already read this or saw the TV series. Luckily for me I've been living under a rock and didn't know a thing about it before venturing into the quaint little town of Wayward Pines. I was immediately immersed in its eerie setting, immediately intrigued by its strangely behaving population, immediately sympathetic to the protagonist, a Secret Service agent by the name of Ethan Burke who wakes up with a concussion after a car accident and a loss of memory. I felt Ethan's unease as my own and not even twenty pages in I was practically begging the author to give the guy some socks because I couldn't keep my own feet from wriggling in empathy-pain throughout Ethan's intensifying sprints. Begging the author to give him some clean, warm clothes as I shivered my way through the pages and the pines. But there would be none of that. And as the main character progressively ran out of unscathed body parts (I think only his left earlobe is left untouched) the questions piled up and I found myself surrounded by mystery. I'm not surprised this got turned into a television series. It was probably written with that in mind. The author cited Twin Peaks as a major influence for this book and referred to other shows such as Lost as coming close to the wonderful experience David Lynch's masterpiece has been to him as a child. This story is set-up in pretty much the same way as these well-known televised mysteries. What the shows have in common is that they manage to create a mystery that speaks to certain basic fears in a setting of beauty and the mundane. This book taps in a lot of nightmares we are all familiar with: small spaces, strange places, darkness, hostile crowds, creepy children, chases, finding yourself naked in public, death, monsters, mutants, loneliness, torture, deserted hospitals. It's almost with the precision of an accountant that the author sequenced one nightmare after the other. It worked until it didn't but to the author's credit: it was already late in the game when I saw the smoke machines in his haunted house. What I enjoy most in the TV shows mentioned earlier as well as in this book is the question: What the hell is going on? What is especially exciting is that instead of getting an answer, the question grows extravagantly larger. The writers weave such an intricate web you start wondering if they'll ever be able to untangle it themselves. You form your own timid theories or starts thereof but can't help to expect something wilder than your own imagination can conjure up. At least that's what I've come to expect from these kinds of mysteries: no matter how wild and crazy the tentacles of the plot writhe about, I expect them to be wrapped up neatly into a nice little box by the end of the story in a fulfilling way. Sadly, shows like Lost lost most of their allure through uncovering their mystery. Can one say this is due to bad writing? Maybe, but I've found that solutions rarely live up to their riddles. Magic tricks invariably become less impressive when you know how it's done. This may be one of the reasons Twin Peaks is still considered to be one of the best shows in its genre: much of its mystery still remains because it got cancelled before it should have been. I have to say that, despite this inherent problem with the mystery formula, Blake Crouch really did an awesome job of both creating a mystery and unraveling it. The reveal came with a satisfying shock. The solution had its beauty to it. And yet, and yet, with the uncovering of the mystery the story took a turn, it played out on a different scale and became a different tale altogether. Some of the plot's tentacles are still showing spasms of uncertainty and ambiguity. I've got the sequels to this book already on the shelf but the fact I'm not immediately running to them is the result of me really liking where this started but being very wary of where it's headed. Coupled with pretty straightforward prose that left this review empty in the quote-department, pointless wartime flashbacks and the absolute humorlessness of what is on all counts a read that shouldn't be above a joke or two, I end up with a rating of 3,5 stars, visually rounded down to a perfectly true \"I liked it\". I just didn't love it as much as all the unsolved mysteries still out there. ...more Review written September 24, 2015. I hate when this happens.

I seriously hate it. Some might think \"ooh, but it's fun being the black sheep!\" but I tell you: It is not. Disliking books is not a comfortable feel. It's as if there's a big party, everyone's invited and when you get there, you figure out no one wants you there. That's how I feel after reading this book. Because I wanted to be crazy about it. Because I wanted to fangirl about it before watching the show. Because - damn it - it's been a long time since I read a book I actually loved! I don't think I was disappointed by this because it was a thriller fail, because in essence, there was no \"real\" problem in the book up until around 80% of it. My issues were the usual ones, and while I was not liking it, I wasn't feeling hatred of the passionate kind. The first thing that started to annoy me was something that got me from page one. It was the writing. Fragmented. Annoying. It really is difficult to read one-sentence paragraphs. I said why in my review for I Am the Messenger . It feels as if you're on a highway. Going very fast. Suddenly, you stop. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. I even bet this section of my review is getting on your nerves. I don't blame you. I would be annoyed too. Many people described the writing atmospheric, but if I'm honest with you, I only found it exasperating and headache-inducing. I can endure writing like this if it was not used as excessively as Crouch used it. As usual, when I find the writing awful, I cannot connect with the book, and this leads to boredom. Really, I lost my interest in the book soon after starting it. The writing ruined it all. But again, I don't think that was enough for a 1-star rating. So well, what was the thing that made me so angry? Plot holes and the unrealistic BIG reveal. Now, don't go telling me this is just fiction because that's bullshit. If this is a sci-fi/thriller, things have to make actual sense. You cannot do stupid things without logic and then say impossible-to-pronounce names of chemical compounds and magic, magic, god said let there be science. No, you just cannot. I can be forgiving for some of these things, but when they're so trivial, I cannot and will not let it pass. (view spoiler) [Yeah, so humans evolve to be like that. Ha, like I'm going to believe it. Look, natural selection does not work that way. It's based on pure chances. If you live in cold weather for your entire life, I can assure you will not look like a monkey by the end of your life. That's not how things work. (Sidenote: If it happens, you have my permission to rise me from my grave and make me eat my own words). Evolution and adaptation does not mean a species will change just like that into something that fits better its environment, and less even in such a short span of time. As I said, it's based on mere chances. Even if we ignore this, what happened in the book does not make sense. Don't humans adapt their surroundings in order to make them habitable? And also, millions of years would be required for such a radical change in our appearance to be possible (just think... Homo sapiens have existed for longer than ten thousand years and we look the same). This turned into a typical boring science talk, but if you're still reading, then it means you're interested in what I have to say. I don't care if you say this is \"just fiction.\" A book does not have to be non-fiction for it to be believable. (hide spoiler) ] Along with the writing and plot holes, there was another thing that didn't work for me. It's probable you already know what I'm going to say. I couldn't connect with the characters. Predictable, huh? Lately it seems I haven't been able to do this. What's weirder is that I had been told Ethan was a fucked-up, questionable character, and you know how much I love those kind of characters - they're the more realistic ones. However, I just found myself annoyed at him and everyone else. I found all of them and their actions unbelievable. The fear I was promised to feel was another factor that was missing for me, and it should not have. I mean, how horrible can it possibly be to wake up in a place you're not familiar with at all? How horrible can it feel to be alien to a place and how worse can it be when no one wants to collaborate with you? It must be a nightmare, and yet, I didn't even have a single ounce of worry. That's pretty much all I have to say. I didn't want this review to be so long or tedious, but well, it just came out that way and I'm not gonna change it. I'm not sure if I will watch the show, but one thing I am certain: I will not be reading the next books. Now, please, please, please, if you disagree with my review, don't go self-righteous mode because you're not going to change my opinion. I did not like this book and nothing you say will make me question neither my rating nor my decision.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Pines by Blake Crouch is a thought provoking page turner!!!

Maybe more to come in the remaining stories. Also, some of the portions of the plot are pretty far-fetched...(and I wasn't quite convinced). The ending was a complete surprise to me. I was wondering if this was going to be another book where many questions were left unanswered. While I didn't love the ending, it did bring closure to the many questions... I will read the remainder of this trilogy and catch up on watching the series. Weird stuff!

I loved his determination, his iron-clad will, his unwillingness to believe the bull shit he was obviously being fed....I loved his reactions to this freaky as fuck town he landed in. He's confused and alone, and everyone is hell bent on calling him crazy, saying he's delusional, that everyone in town is happy and why don't you try and make a life of it here? It's so nice! Why don't you have your ID or wallet?? Are you lying to us, Mr. Burke? How dare you do such a thing! Needless to say I'm already finished with book two-Yeah, I love this series that much. The scream could only be compared to human suffering or terror. Like a hyena or a banshee. Coyotes at their maddest. The mythologized Rebel Yell. High and thin. Fragile. Terrible. And on some level, humming under the surface like buried electrical cables, was a dim awareness that this wasn't the first time he'd heard it. Chilling and grotesque , Ethan is stuck in a town with virtually no way out...and no answers. Continually running in circles and trying to find answers-each one more spine-tingling than the last-Ethan is going out of his mind. Cloaked in an eerie atmosphere that you can't help but to fall in love with, I guarantee this could be your next page turner. I wish I could say more, but that's not in the spirit of this book, so I'll be blunt: While depraved and intentionally mysterious , this book will keep you on the edge of your seat. And, while not for everyone, anyone who loves a good thriller and a man determined to win-at any cost-will likely find great enjoyment out of this book. I hope that these measly words will be enough to influence you to give this one a chance. Easy . Dark . Manipulative . What more could a girl ask for?

Review to come :) ...more A fun read, though not brilliant in terms of the final revelation; it more or less ties things up but there seem to be more than a few inexplicable plot points. Also, the author's habit of breathlessly listing sentence fragments became incredibly annoying by the end. Constant. Never-ending. Fragments. Just hanging. I was sufficiently hooked by Pines to read on, but I won't be picking up another Blake Crouch book as a result. Just in case. Annoying. Really.

I was sufficiently hooked by Pines to read on, but I won't be picking up another Blake Crouch book as a result. Just in case. Annoying. Really. It also seemed, for a large majority of the book, that the story was simply a list of physical activities and incapacitating injuries which didn't seem to actually impair the protagonist's abilities at all. He ran, jumped, climbed things, jumped some more, chimneyed, jumped and ran, did some more running and all with massive bruising, blistered feet, a duct-taped together thigh, various head injuries and a killer headache. Suspend your disbelief and ignore the writing style, and there's the fun read I mentioned. Try to take it as seriously as it takes itself, however, and there's a world of irritation waiting to be discovered. ...more \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 I\u2019m sad to admit that I watch way more TV than I should, so I know offhand that May is always the time of year, when the networks release their fall schedules, finalize any cancelations, and post trailers for new shows. Sometimes I like browse thru a few of those trailers that happen to grab my attention. Last year I saw a very intriguing one for an upcoming show on Fox called Wayward Pines.

Then \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u00bd I\u2019m sad to admit that I watch way more TV than I should, so I know offhand that May is always the time of year, when the networks release their fall schedules, finalize any cancelations, and post trailers for new shows. Sometimes I like browse thru a few of those trailers that happen to grab my attention. Last year I saw a very intriguing one for an upcoming show on Fox called Wayward Pines. After watching, I filed it away in the old steel trap, and didn\u2019t think too much more about it. Then a few months ago I noticed a few friends started posting reviews of a book called Pines. Somehow it seemed vaguely familiar, but I didn\u2019t quite piece it all together until\u2026I really hate to admit this, but it was Kelly\u2019s crazy ass review that finally got me to add this to my tbr. Once I did a little research, it all came flooding back. So here I am again, one of the last to the party, and late with my review as per usual. Attempting to review this with no spoilers is a bit tricky, but I\u2019ll give it a go. Having been a long time student of Sherlock Holmes, I\u2019ve always utilized this piece of sage advice when tackling any new mystery, \u201cOnce you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\u201d Well Mr. Holmes, that\u2019s all fine and dandy when dealing with one of your little adventures, or maybe even some mysteries here in the real world. But the problem with applying that to our story here is, we don\u2019t initially know what is actually impossible, and that\u2019s the rub? Having read numerous fantastical stories, I wasn\u2019t quite sure how far the impossible could stretch. Over the course of the story, I came up with, and eliminated, several different hypotheses. But the one that I held on to, the only one that seemed to fit all the clues, finally ended up bearing some fruit. While I may have been correct in my theory, I was still way off in the scope. So now I put the challenge to you, dear reader. Throw on your deerstalker cap, insert that old brier-root pipe in your maw, perhaps even have a snort of cocaine. Whaddaya say, do you think you\u2019re ready to crack this nut? If so, here are a few sample questions to chew on: \u2745Why can we not make contact with the outside world? \u2745Why can\u2019t we just leave? \u2745Why do we not trust certain people? \u2745What is Wayward Pines? \u2745What the H E double hockey sticks is going on here?! A few other important questions will creep up along your journey, but I don\u2019t want to list those for fear of spoiling your own experience. The good news is, if you follow all the clues, you too may solve this mystery. The bad news is, those morons at Fox seem to have condensed all 3 books into a very short 10 episode miniseries/season. I guess they had zero faith in any renewal for a potential 2nd and 3rd seasons, so now I\u2019ll have to read books 2 & 3, before starting the show! Final verdict: Are there some problems? You bet (particularly the reasoning laid out for the f\u00eates, didn't really vibe with the mission goals), but for the most part I was able to overlook any shortcomings and enjoy the ride. So if you read for excitement, mystery, and intrigue, I\u2019d say this one doles out a fair share of each. If you enjoy those short, fast paced thrillers, you\u2019re in luck! Just keep in mind: YESTERDAY IS HISTORY. TOMORROW IS A MYSTERY. TODAY IS A GIFT. THAT\u2019S WHY IT\u2019S CALLED THE PRESENT. WORK HARD, BE HAPPY, AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE IN WAYWARD PINES! 3.5 Stars rounded up for now, pending book 2 :P ...more N\u00e3o posso ouvir grilos a cantar que me lembro logo desta trilogia... j\u00e1 ponho tudo o que me rodeia em causa!

Is it death by suffocation? Or is it finding yourself in a completely foreign place -- lost, confused, devoid of any contacts to the outside world and where no one seems to know you? Waking was Wayward Pines. This beautiful hell. Agent Ethan Burke woke with a spiltting headache and a slight memory loss after a car accident. He was admitted to a hospital and when he came to next, he found himself trapped inside the walls of Wayward Pines. At first glance, the town is quiet and peaceful... The perfect paradise to settle down in when you've reached a ripe old age. It's a perfect place to die in. But of course, nothing and no one is what they seem to be... once you look deeper enough. Perfection was a surface thing. The epidermis. Cut a few layers deep, you begin to see some darker shades. Cut to the bone\u2014 pitch black. If I were to be deadly honest here, there are at some points where I find this book . . . lacking. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the book. Pines did held my ever wavering attention, but it was short-lived. For the first half, it was everything I could ever ask for in a book. \u2022 Creepy atmosphere? Check. \u2022 Unreliable, flawed main character who won't bent down to the obstacles? Check. \u2022 Nail-biting mystery that fucks with your mind and drags you into the other direction? Check. The best part would be when the story made you question and second guess everything and everyone in it. What's the motive of the town's existence and the people in them? Is it some sort of a government experiment? This guy's fishy... I don't like him. Oh my gosh, what if he's an alien?! Why the fuck is everyone so suspicious here?! I want answers! When a book can do that to me then I can safely consider that Pines has the qualities of a great mystery book. Me, I love nothing more than a good mindfuck but in this case, that all goes out the window the moment I started to get annoyed with certain aspects. At first, I was completely in love with the writing style. It was atmospheric and has an eerie tone to it. It did felt like I was the one in Ethan's shoes but it wasn't exactly fun when you keep getting physically hurt and confused all the time. However, by the time the tension began peaking to its highest point, I was already cross-eyed. The way the author strings his words have started to grate on my nerves. The sentences are fragmented. Cut short. Like this. Forgive me, dear author. For not appreciating the writing so much. The thing is. It gets fucking annoying. Then there's the flashbacks that happen randomly. Ethan falls on his face.. FLASHBACK! Ethan steps on a pebble... FLASHBACK! Ethan gets bludgeoned on the head with a metal chair.. FLASHBACK! Have I ever mentioned that I absolutely haaate flashbacks? This is a personal preference but I prefer books with minimum backstories. Or better yet NONE. This book got tons of them that stretched on and on and on and on and . . . on. Worse yet, these huge chunks of text are italicised. My eyes can't stand it. Even worse is when I realize that the flashbacks amount to nothing. I did not care for what happen all those years ago to Ethan. Tell me in just one paragraph about his past experiences. Not pages of it. Then there's the major flaw. PLOT HOLE(s)! They're cluttered all over the damn place by the time I got further in. Try as I might but I can't ignore them especially not when I was left with more questions instead of coherent answers. I so want to explain myself but I can't unless I spoil the whole shit so I won't go in depth on it. But this review by Becky explained everything I had in question. WARNING! Major spoilers in there! Will I continue reading the next one? For sure. But it will be a while before I return to this series. Will I watch the show? Hell yeah. So to wrap it up, I did had fun with Pines but it was only fun while it lasted. There are many parts where I find myself feeling underwhelmed instead of awed or fucked over with. I actually feel sorry for not liking it so much since there were so many high ratings and gushing reviews for this book. Ugh. ...more \u0388\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7

We can't imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven't the humility to try. We've been residents here for the blink of an eye. It we're gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us. Michael Crichton Just imagine walking down your driveway to your mail box. On the way you look to your left and see a family in the front yard of your neighbor house that you've never seen before. Then you look to your right and see this young couple moving into the house that you know is already occupied with a family. Everything seems so strange and you're sure the next door neighbors were just there yesterday. As you are getting to the mailbox, you see a car in the driveway you've never seen before. Hmmmm, who parked their car in my fucking driveway? You get to the mailbox and think, this neighborhood is going to shit. You open the mailbox and see mail that isn't even in your name, but its the right address. I mean, come on! How hard is it to get the addresses right. You place the mail back in the mailbox and put the flag up. You start walking back up the driveway looking at this car thinking today is not my day. As you open the door to your house its not your house..you step back out and look at the front and it looks like your house but the inside isn't your house. You walk in and the pictures on the walls aren't of your family..in fact there are no pictures of you...and there are people in your kitchen that isn't your family and you start to go dizzy and your head is pounding and everything is spinning the teeth, the teeth, the teeth, the teeth and going bright and LOUD AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOU ARE!!!!! That's how I felt the first 80% of the book, like I had no idea where I was and what was going on and how I got to work that day. All I know is I had to stop the audiobook every few minutes to see if this was the book and not me hallucinating. I mean, you should see the text messages I was sending to a certain someone.... It's all Shandra's Fault . I was questioning my sanity and if I was in fact Athena.... Then you get to the end and its RAGE and tears and not acceptance but WTF!

It is engaging and disturbing with non-stop action and bodies hitting the floor. Ethan Burke wakes up by the river with no recollection of who and where he is, that's about as far as I dare go without spoiler tagging because the the beauty of this book is in its endless mire of mysteries. The writing surprisingly worked for me. Crouch's staccato style works well in emphasizing that Ethan Burke is a man of action, more comfortable in throwing punches than conversation. What didn't work for me though is the derivative plot, it's been beaten over the head in most, if not all, dystopian YAs out there . What sets Pines apart is the remarkable execution. Highly recommended if you want to be taken on a ride in the dark, in a car with no brakes. 3.5 enjoyment stars. ...more<---C>Blake Crouch</---C>", "Title": "Pines"},
