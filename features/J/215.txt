And that\u2019s the synopsis! <+++>The Falls</+++> is a thick novel and a hypnotic one as well. It is easy to get lost in its opening 100 pages or so \u2013 not lost as in confused, lost as if in a strange waking dream, or the sleepy thoughts before slumber takes over. At first it is a story of an eccentric woman and a good man, and the love that brings them together. It is a novel that is dense with detail and characterization from beginning to end, but I had such an odd time with that first part. Perhaps it was due to that odd woman. Ariah is the most solipsistic of characters, dreadful and admirable and fascinating and frustrating. Depending on my mood, she either totally absorbed me or she put me to sleep.<---F> It was an interesting experience</---F>. At times I considered giving up because it was also a challenging experience and I\u2019m not sure I was in the right frame of mind. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t! The story of Ariah and her suitor Dick Burnaby ends in two remarkable chapters that lit me right up: one about Ariah\u2019s acceptance of a marriage proposal, detailed in prose so sharp and fierce and idiosyncratic that it woke all of the different parts of my mind; the other a much longer chapter depicting the early years of the marriage itself \u2013 a chapter full of loveliness and wisdom, passion and sadness, all the things I needed to suddenly become fully re-engaged with the novel. The story after that first 100 pages is quite different. More traditional, well as far as Oates can ever be traditional. It is a sort of miniature family saga that focuses on Ariah\u2019s three children, their loves and lives and ambitions and failures, and the battle that is being waged over the poison that has been dumped in the Niagara Falls region for decades. It becomes one of those Big Novels about Important Issues... but yet it still stays intimate. I was able to feel anger at corporate cupidity and the crass banality at the heart of many evil men, but <+++>The Falls</+++>' biggest attribute even amidst all of that is its brilliant characterization. The children of Ariah and Dick Burnably are amazing \u2013 and amazingly real \u2013 creations. The novel troubled me a bit, specifically around Ariah\u2019s later characterization. It made wonder... does Oates have a problem with women? I never expected to feel that way about one of my favorite authors, but the fact remains that many, many of Oates\u2019 most vital female characters are either delicate victims or fascinating monsters. Is there no inbetween for her \u2013 and are there no genuine heroines? She has no problem in making Dick Burnaby and his two male children perfectly heroic in their perfectly human ways. They manage to be both real and good . Not so with Ariah. Why did she have to be transformed into such a horrorshow, such a toxic and repulsive figure? Was Oates even aware that what she was creating was not someone to be admired for her independence and eccentricity, but rather someone to be loathed for her small-mindedness, her tunnel vision, her mistreatment of her children? I dunno. Well, it was a disturbing realization but it cannot be denied that Ariah Burnaby is a unique creation. She's a great addition to the JCO gallery of Monster-Women. Oates is known to be chilly writer, at times even callous or cruel. Not so much with The Falls. With the possible exception of the monstrous, deluded Ariah, her protagonists are written with much kindness and empathy. Even better, I am happy to report that this novel somehow finds its way to grace in the end. It was well-earned. There was a small moment near the end when one nearly-broken character takes another character\u2019s hands \u2013 big, rough, scarred paws that have felt and even caused a lot of hurt \u2013 and she realizes that they are the most beautiful hands she\u2019s ever seen. I read that part and thought to myself, This is why I love reading \u2026 these sublime human moments, these moments of transcendence. The Falls is full of such moments. ...more I read The Falls for book club. I was looking forward to reading it, given its roots in historical events and my past reading of her novel, We Were the Mulvaneys. The Falls was, hands down, the worst novel I have read for years. If I could, I would give it 1/4 of a star. The first few hundred pages are horrid: adjective after adjective describing nothing. The characters are boring, generally unbelievable, and have no depth.

To her credit, Joyce Carol Oates offers the reader moments of promise: description of Niagara Falls during the 1950s and the events surrounding the Love Canal lawsuit. Unfortunately, Oates breaks her promise, and instead focuses on the lives of the family members caught up in the time and the lawsuit: members the reader could care less about. I waded (<---B>more like skimmed</---B>) page after page of this novel for my book club (otherwise I would never have gone beyond page 90) only to find myself laughing hysterically by the end. The book goes like this: pages and pages of meaningless prose and flowery adjectives, during which moments of possibility and intellect actually appear, only to be abandoned as quickly as it was presented in place of more meaningless prose, until the reader is hit on the head with the end. Oates must have been jolted from her depression, or must have been as bored with her own book as I was (or she was late for a deadline) because she packs a full novel in the last 1/3 of the book - introducing new characters who are as bland as the originals - and does absolutely nothing with them. Seriously. A total disaster of a book. ...more Synopsis Widowed on her wedding night when her new husband, a young minister and latent homosexual, throws himself into the falls, Ariah Littrell, the plain, awkward daughter of a minister, henceforth considers herself damned.

Her bleak future becomes miraculously bright when Dirk Burnaby, a handsome, wealthy bon vivant with an altruistic heart, falls in love with the media-dubbed Widow-Bride. Their rapturous happiness is shadowed only by Ariah's illogical conviction over the years that Dirk will leave her and their three children someday. Her unreasonable fear becomes self-fulfilling when her increasingly unstable behavior, combined with Dirk's obsessed but chaste involvement with Nina Olshaker, a young mother who enlists his help in alerting the city fathers to the pestilential conditions in the area later to be known as Love Canal, opens a chasm in their marriage. His gentle heart inspired by a need for justice, Dirk takes on the powerful, corrupt politicians, his former peers and pals, in a disastrous lawsuit that ruins him socially and financially and results in his death. Oates adroitly addresses the material of this \"first\" class action lawsuit and makes the story fresh and immediate. \"In the end, all drama is about family,\" a character muses, and while the narrative occasionally lapses into melodrama in elucidating this theme, Oates spins a haunting story in which nature and humans are equally rapacious and self-destructive. ...more JCO is one of those writers you either love or hate.

I felt a little compelled to read this because it is set in the Niagra area, where I have visited many times. There are two main problems with this book, and they permeate the book unfortunately. The first is that Oates' characters are not in any way genuine. Their reactions, motivations, what they say and do all ring false. I hope each time that I read a fictional work to be transported and to feel in some way that the characters might be real people. This absolutely does not happen in \"The Falls.\" Quite the opposite happens, again and again I thought the author had no human understanding. The second problem is that it is in sorry need of an edit. For example, there were way too many descriptions of the main character's eye color of \"gasoline green.\" Annoying both for the repetition and because it is a terrible description. There were many instances of pages introducing a place or character, and then a few pages later a sentence or paragraph introducing them again. What I surmise is that no one was willing to read the book from first to last page, and therefore would not catch the redundancies. If you have not yet started reading this book please don't! Life is too short to waste it on bad writing. ...more This book follows the life of a woman haunted by the rejection of her first spouse and her eternal fear that she will be rejected by anyone who is drawn into her circle of life. Ariah lives her life almost as a fugitive, constantly looking over her shoulder, reading into things said as proof that she is unworthy of affection. She becomes brittle and nearly unapproachable. By protecting herself, she seems to live life in the shadows, barely participating, but an influence nonetheless.

And I know I will return to Oates every once in a while, since I enjoy her distinct voice and style. The title \"The Falls\" is well chosen, as it covers the layered \"falls\" herein. On the surface it is, obviously a reference to the Niagara Falls, where just about the whole story takes place, but it also covers the various kinds of \"falls from grace\" and disappointments taking place throughout the story. It is a tale dripping with pain, mourning and sadness. Oates is known for her stories evolving around the myriad aspects of \"the American Dream.\" I'd say that goes for this story too, although it generally takes a backseat and lets the more generic topic of family/relationship elements take center stage. We follow a family and what happens to it in the years 1950 to 1978 (with the 1960s mostly left a blank). All the way through with the woman Ariah as the revolving point. I greatly admire the way Oates gives us the story chronologically by seamlessly jumping \"on the shoulder\" of each character, at a crucial moment in their life. Telling things from that character's point of view for a while, in that person's unique voice & through that person's perception. That is a masterstroke! It starts with Ariah and her first husband's suicide on their honeymoon--then we see things from his perspective, up to the suicide at the Niagara Falls--then from his second husband, the wealthy Dirk Burnaby... And after his tragic death (officially an accident at the Falls, but really a hit orchestrated by powerful companies and individuals who dislike him forcing a trial case against them & their heavy polution of the area) we jump to the mid-to-late '70s, where we follow their three children. Who all one way or other have the shadow of their father's death hovering-- plus their estranged mother's power over them. This story examines family ties and what can go terrible wrong, and the consequences thereof. It also tells a story of modern industry ruining a natural reserve (the Niagara Falls) and the people living there, be that physically, morally and whatnot. Ariah, in my opinion, is mad--and descends deeper and deeper into it, in avoidance of emotion and attachments to people, incl. her own children; and general denial of a lot of things. How this is portrayed is quite remarkable. The only \"but\" I really have to this story is that too many characters and incidents are \"left hanging\", having no real bearing on the story and its advancement as a whole, which annoys me. A little tidying up here would have been nice. To a certain degree I can understand why we get to see things from the perspective of the suicidal husband (after all, his act is the pivotal spin for what happens to Ariah and, hence, the family we then follow), but a character like the mysterious, strange Polish guy, Mr. Pankowski--what is that all about, really? We're never told. I even suspect he may even be Dirk himself! (His body is never found, you see.) But who knows? Adding color, and introducing persons as it happens in real life, is all fine, but it needs to be important to the story. Elements like these may have been intended as important (enough) to the story, but if so I fail to see a number of the relevances. There are times, however, where I recognized tidbits of information, so I am sure much of my complaining is simply due to my limited knowledge about a lot of things, regardless of advancement of the story itself. Here is one I did get: Ariah at some point remarks that she liked Elvis' singing, if not his style (rock'n'roll). At first this reference seemed offbeat to me, but then I figured that since it was less than a year since Elvis died (in real life and in the story's timeline) it actually made a kind of sense that Elvis would be a person who one--even one like Ariah--would refer to when talking about singing; his death was still fresh enough in people's mind.

I've read a few of her stories over the years, though none of them particularly stand out in my mind. I have vague but admiring memories of what is probably her most famous short story, frequently anthologized, called \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\" I know she's considered something of an icon in the fiction world, so I took that into this experience, expecting what's generally called \"literary fiction,\" and expecting it to be well The Falls was my first ever Joyce Carol Oates novel. I've read a few of her stories over the years, though none of them particularly stand out in my mind. I have vague but admiring memories of what is probably her most famous short story, frequently anthologized, called \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\" I know she's considered something of an icon in the fiction world, so I took that into this experience, expecting what's generally called \"literary fiction,\" and expecting it to be well done. How did it work out? I'd have to give The Falls a B-, as a novel (though I always shudder at the idea of critics, lazy dilettantes, essentially just readers willing to write a few opinionated words, grading the work of artists, who have gone to so much more trouble to actually create something). Why not a higher grade? Basically, I think The Falls has within it several good short stories, but that JCO is filling in the space between those with lots of material that not only doesn't feel very substantial, it's sometimes downright tedious. The best of the short stories in this novel, I think, is probably the one that opens it, about two people on their honeymoon: a shy, retiring, overly-intellectual minister's daughter and an overwrought, intense, overly-intellectual, closeted homosexual minister's son, roped into a loveless union by the harsh realities of social necessity. The problem with this really great story is that it's over just when you've gotten interested, and you're left wondering, What could the rest of all these unread pages possibly be about? The second story in the novel is nearly as good, about an unlikely romance, but once that story hits the top of its narrative arc, we're sort of set adrift for long stretches of time, most of which are expressed as something more like the literary equivalent of \"time passed.\" Eventually, the wobbly story tries to find some legs again with some historical turf: the Love Canal ecological disaster and the resulting legal cases. A not quite red herring of a romance simmers here, but seems to serve mainly as a distraction. This part of the book feels more like a thinly veiled essay about the machinery of society: how power and money can so easily collude to line the pockets of the already wealthy even (or maybe always) at the expense of the working class. Finally, we move on to another generation of protagonists, and you sense JCO running out of steam here. If they were to be included at all, these children probably deserve to be in their own novel, rather than plugged into the ending of someone else's story. Their stories do seem interesting, but they never quite generate enough interest, particularly since the attention must now be split between three children of our original protagonists, and must continue to include material about the first generation, as well. There just isn't enough room left for everyone to get their just due, at least in the way that JCO has established already (where a single night and the following morning get 60 very detailed pages). The book has a very ragged feel to it as it draws to its conclusion, an ending that seems dictated more by the conventions of length of literary fiction than by the demands of the story itself, as if JCO realized, or was warned by her editor, We can't really go past 400 pages, so you'd better wrap things up and tack on an epilogue. ...more E\u2019 stato il mio primo incontro con Joyce Carol Oates e non sar\u00e0 l\u2019ultimo.

Ariah finds the suicide note h left but destroys it without telling anyone. During the seven days that Ariah keeps watch as police search for his body, a young lawyer, Dirk Burnaby, keeps her company. A month later Ariah is back in Troy, NY when Burnaby shows up, tells her he can't get her out of his mind, and begs her to marry him. She does and they move back to Niagara Falls where Burnaby grew up in a prominent and affluent family. Burnaby's devotion to his wife is both admirable and baffling. They have three children though Ariah is never sure if their first-born son, Chandler, belongs to Dirk or her first husband, however unlikely that may seem. Throughout the years she continually hears stories about the \"Widow Bride,\" the sad young woman whose husband left her on their wedding night and \"fell\" into the gorge. With three small children and a successful law practice, Dirk makes a difficult decision, he decides to take the case of a group of working class people whose lives are being ruined by mysterious illnesses. They all live in an area known as Love Canal. It is an unfortunate decision because it destroys Dirk's standing in the community, and eventually, his life. The second half of the book is told from the points of view of each of their three children - Chandler, Royall, and Juliet -- as each seeks to find the truth of their father's life. This is a deep, dark, extraordinary book in which the Falls themselves become as much a character within the story as any of the others. It is not a book for everyone but I found it mesmerizing and I'm sure it will haunt me for a very long time. ...more The woman in black intrigues me. When I read The Falls, I thought she was Nina Olshaker, recognizing Dirk in Royall, making love to Royall as she had not been able to do with his father. On the other hand, the scene in the cemetery is eerie and unreal enough to make a case for her being a phantom.

Her diction reminded me of Claudine, but Claudine would have been much older and never would have worn those clothes, and her hair was blond, not black, and she was always impeccably coiffed and never barefoot. Nina is described as the Woman in Black in the \"Before\" chapter in part two. \"She was the Woman in Black. She was observing him, she was waiting to waylay him. She was patient, relentless. Waiting for him....\" Dirk forgot her name and \"imagined Death.\" Maybe the woman in black in the cemetery scene is Death, maybe Royall makes love with Death, but I prefer to think it is Nina twenty years later. On page 286 JCO writes \"And there was the woman in black waiting for him....\" On the next page she writes \"Royall realized that the woman must have been waiting for him.\" The Woman in Black in Part 2 too closely parallels the woman in black in Part 3 for it to be a coincidence. I really wanted Ms. Oates to confirm this when I met her at the book signing after her reading at the CHF. However, she did not. Her concern was elsewhere, and I am left to speculate, as I frequently am in the aftermath of her novels. ...more Joyce Carol Oates has become quite a name in the fiction world.

Her paranoia increases her husband takes on a controversial case known as Love Canal and threats divorce for \u2018going outside the family\u2019. This creates a negative cocoon that deeply affects her family especially after the death of her second husband. The third half of the novel revolves around the three children coping with their mother, discovering the truth about their father and themselves. Throughout the falls always has a presence; driving, mysterious, and maddening and is somehow connected with each character. ...more This was my second Joyce Carol Oates after reading We Were the Mulvaneys.

University of Buffalo also has an online library of documents related to Love Canal at http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/pr... ...more What can I say about Joyce Carol Oates? Her ability to tackle just about any genre continues to amaze me with each new book. Take, for example, the Falls, which begins as a sort of modern Greek Tragedy, before seamlessly transitioning into a ravishing romance, and then (later) a legal thriller that reads like a combination of Silent Spring and A Civil Action.

More than that, The Falls is an entertaining, enjoyable read and demands less from the reader than some of Oates' other novels. While some might label that a disadvantage, I enjoyed this \"breather\" in my exploration of Oates' canon and think this book might make a perfect introduction for somebody new to Oates country. ...more The beginning of this book mesmerized me much as the very Falls described here by Oates.

Her writing is both technical and inspired, to the point of my making comparisons of her style to that of the Brontes.

From the first page, you sense that they're going to be known to death, literally splayed by her insight. And before you realize it, she's done the same thing to us. For 40 years, she's coyly enticed us with the gothic details of ordinary life and then - when it's too late - pinned us on the sharp point of her wisdom. I read \"The Falls,\" her latest novel, in what seemed like one held breath. Set around Niagara, the story reflects all the romance, mystery, and terror of that spectacular waterfall. It's a great confluence of tones - grotesque and domestic, tragic and comic. The currents of various styles and points of view blend together in a way that can't possibly work, but does. How else to begin at Niagara Falls but with a honeymoon - and a suicide? Ariah Littrell's desperation to be married had reached a fever pitch, which is pretty much the mental condition she maintains for the rest of her life. Though she's terrified of sex and disgusted by her own body, at 29 \"she would have gladly traded her soul for an engagement ring,\" Oates writes. The daughter of a prominent minister, she's thrilled to be marrying another minister, even if she doesn't really love him, even if she knows he can't love her, \"an old maid.\" The morning after their first night together - an evening of consummate humiliation - her new husband answers the call of the roaring water outside their bridal suite and throws himself over. It's a classic Oates moment - hypnotically awful, the kind of slow-motion disaster you can't take your eyes off. Ariah, long determined to be the perfect wife, immediately recasts herself as \"The Widow Bride of the Falls,\" maintaining a seven-day vigil while police search for her new husband's body. The hotel manager, desperate to downplay this common \"accident\" as gracefully as possible, appeals for help to a friend, a charming, well-connected lawyer named Dirk Burnaby. But poor Dirk is drawn to Ariah the way people are drawn to the water, and he falls head over heels for this anxious, brittle woman. The heart of the novel is the story of their marriage and the family they build together through the 1950s and early '60s. Dirk loves his wife and their three children, his law firm grows more prosperous, and the Burnabys enjoy an idyllic suburban existence. Except that Ariah wields a kind of psychological brutality, cutting away anything unpleasant, anything that troubles her, such as memories of her first husband, news of the world, the complexity of her new husband's legal work, neighbors' friendly invitations, even telephone calls. It's all banished in a flurry of anxious protests and ferocious pleading. She alternately shrieks and cajoles, stares down anyone who crosses her, or runs from the room with hands over her ears. Ariah excites the same perverse fascination as Amanda Wingfield in \"The Glass Menagerie.\" In fact, she's a kind of middle-class companion to Tennessee Williams's classic mother-monster, though she's trapped in a mythical present instead of a mythical past. She draws her children around her even as she repels them, constantly calling attention to her anxieties with ceaseless, ludicrous denials that anything is wrong. Dirk, meanwhile, finds himself compelled to represent a young woman who claims that her neighborhood, along an area known as Love Canal, has been poisoned by chemical waste. There's little precedent for environmental liability, and Dirk knows that a conspiracy of business and political forces will make justice almost impossible to attain, but he pursues the case with a dogged idealism that threatens his business, his family, and his own life. \"The Falls\" is written in a strange, fluid cycle of voices, a blending of these characters' thoughts and the author's searing, ironic judgment. Sometimes, characters speak for themselves, or the three Burnaby children speak in a kind of composite voice. Some sections employ the repetitions of a chorus. Others sound like newspaper accounts. One odd chapter reads like an eroticized ghost story. Oates handles all this with winning confidence, moving through intimate details just as deftly as she re-creates a crucial period in environmental law. Most of the mysteries here are tied up, but others are lost in the mist. When she tells the story of Dirk's grandfather, an acrobat who once walked across the Falls on a wire, I couldn't help thinking of the daredevil feat she braves herself with this novel. Ultimately, corporate thugs and their crooked judges can't keep chemicals from oozing out of the ground, any more than Ariah can keep the past from seeping into her children's lives. The desperate struggle to hide and the desperate struggle to uncover collide in these pages with gripping effect. Surprisingly, though it's full of creepy, ominous energy, by the end this is a novel of forgiveness, of learning to accept what's oddest and cruelest about those we love. It's a scary, perceptive portrayal of family life, particularly the burdens parents force on their children and the way love can make those burdens, if not light, then at least bearable. http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0914/p1... ...more A tale whose theme is resurgent in this age where industrial pollution and climate change are high on everyone\u2019s mind.

Niagara Falls in the \u201860\u2019s may have been the Love Capital of America but it was also the home of Love Canal, the most polluted industrial site that erupted and exposed the evil underbelly of crony capitalism. And yet this novel begins (and ends) as a love story: a young headstrong woman, Ariah Erskine, and her pastor husband who is hiding the secret of his sexuality go to the Falls on their honeymoon like most middle class Americans. Being forced to reveal his secret on their wedding night, the young husband takes his life at the Falls the following morning, thus establishing this modern Wonder of the World as an integral part of the Erskine-Burnaby family, forging character and destroying it. The love story continues with Ariah\u2019s second marriage to Dirk Burnaby, an idealistic lawyer from a local patrician family who takes on the corruption of his friends and gambling buddies when he discovers the level of pollution and the shocking number of deaths being attributed to Love Canal on the outskirts of the Falls. But love is always hard-fought and short-lived in this book, and it is for the progeny of Ariah and Dirk as well, for duty and class often clash, resulting in loss. The novel has a deliberate narrative style, much of it is told. The author takes control by relating the stories of her character\u2019s lives, detailing their inter-relationships, likes and dislikes. Much has been commented on the adjective-heaviness of this tale, and I have to agree, besides the stage directions and back story offered in parentheses is clumsy. And yet Oates is able to speak in the voices of her characters, forsaking proper grammar if and when needed. One is often forced to decide whether this is a generational story, a love story, or a tale of political intrigue, because all three themes interweave throughout the novel but take centre stage individually at times. The women are strong willed, hard-hearted, and even cruel: Claudine, the mother in law, is the classic upper-class bitch, Candace blackmails Ariah\u2019s son Royall to marry her by pretending to be pregnant, and the \u201cWoman in Black\u201d artfully seduces her men across the generations. Ariah herself emerges as a proud, dominating figure, unrelenting despite losing both husbands to the Falls. The men, by contrast, are weak, idealistic and prone to tragedy: Rev. Erskine and Dirk Burnaby, Ariah\u2019s son Chandler who puts himself in harm\u2019s way during hostage negotiations, and Dirk\u2019s nemesis, his uncle, who walked the Falls on a tightrope. Perhaps the Falls, Love Canal and the Woman in Black are intended as metaphors for death that stalks this multi-generational family. It is only in Aria\u2019s daughter Julia and her reticent boyfriend Stonecrop that we see the roles reversed between weakness and strength. The ending is a bit of a fizzle, an overdone tribute to Dirk Burnaby after the Love Canal lawsuit is finally settled. And yet I enjoyed this book for its bold indictment of capitalism taken to ridiculous lengths in a developed country, and for its depiction of the lives of the social classes in Niagara Falls. Living close to the Falls myself (on the Canadian side, which gets scarcely a mention, other than for an admission by the author that the Horseshoe Falls provides a better view \u2013 and I agree!), I have a deep interest in this magical location\u2019s allure, history and myth. This novel may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but it certainly is mine! ...more Joyce Carol Oates expertly takes cultural icons and important events and builds novels around them that seem vividly real--as they could very well be. The Falls is actually several stories all wrapped into one novel. First, we meet Ariah Erksine, a newlywed whose husband commits suicide the morning after their wedding night by getting up early, racing to the falls, and plunging in.

This is the strange event that gets the novel going. JCO is very good at this; many of her novels begin with events that are very strange and very tragic, but they are always believable when they roll off her pen. The second strange event is that Dirk Burnaby, a lawyer friend of the local entrepreneur who happens to own the hotel at which Ariah is staying, and a rich, highly eligible bachelor, falls in love with Ariah while she keeps her eccentric, week-long vigil by the falls, until rescue crews find her husband's corpse. She becomes known as The Widow Bride of the Falls, and winds up marrying Burnaby a short time later, a man she barely knows. He's persuasive. The two of them have a very passionate relationship and three children, before Dirk Burnaby becomes engrossed in the first Love Canal Case--this is 1962. Here, JCO provides a short history of the Love Canal tragedy that is both succinct and riveting, though she does change the names. I've googled enough to know that the basic facts are correct. This case was never resolved until 1978, and Burnably did not live to see it. On the contrary, his life was ruined because he took this case. The latter part of the book follows his children, their relationship with their strange, damaged mother, and how each of them play a part in discovering a part of their father's past, despite their mother's determined silence. This is a family history that takes place in the wake of the famous Niagara Falls, and I found it quite poignant. I became quite involved with this novel, and liked most of the principal characters. Though long, at 481 pages, it went by rather quickly, and I would gladly recommend it to most people. ( ...more This book met my standard for keeping me engrossed on the subway.

But aside from the said graveyard sex, where the son has a bizarre sexual encounter with a woman who was only suspected of (and did not have) a sexual relationship with the father, I didn't see much of that going on. Instead, the story of the difficult Ariah trifurcates into the stories of her three children, and there is a rather perfunctory-feeling attempt at reunification of both the plots and the family itself at a memorial for the quasi-heroic and misunderstood husband and father. I found the political part of the story - the beginnings of the Love Canal scandal and the rottenness at the heart of the business/political class - laid on *just* thick enough. Any more, and I would have complained that Oates' research was overwhelming the story. On the other hand, the evocation of the Falls themselves, in all their magnificent, romantic and anti-romantic, deadly, mysterious, curiously familiar glory, was wonderful, and I could definitely have lived with more of the same. Anyway, structural complaints aside, I really appreciated the strong imagery and storytelling, and I would most certainly read more by this author (this was my first). ...more My first JCO book and possibly my last.

That Oates intermittently punctuates her descriptions by italicizing the mostly cliched inner thoughts of her characters was too much for me. Penelope Fitzgerald once said, \"I always feel the reader is very insulted by being told too much.\" Apparently, this is not a concern shared by Joyce Carol Oates. I waved the white flag around page 80. Perhaps if I had hung around longer, the Ariah character might have started to make sense and maybe I would have found that Oates fleshed out more complex reasons for her husband's suicide other than that he was gay in the 50s. In a pretty cool epigraph, Oates seems to be setting the stage for a mysterious suicide - that the Falls will cast a spell on an otherwise unlikely jumper. Instead her closeted gay husband premeditates his death in the hotel room, leaves a note, and makes a beeline for the falls. How uninteresting. ...more I've read some complaints about this book as being \"over-written\" and \"boring\" with \"hard-to-like characters\" - and while I can see where these folks are coming from - this is part of what I like about JCO.

I would imagine such details during a hugely important happening that shaped a character and her future would matter. While it's sometimes frustrating that nothing comes from certain details (Ariah hiding the note, Royall's encounter with the woman in black), if not meant as a red herring (annoying) it also resembles real life where not everything is resolved or addressed. And I did find the Niagara history totally enthralling. ...more I'm sad to have finished The Falls!

I would recommend this book for anyone looking to get lost in a period piece with lots of twists and turns. ...more \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u062c\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0642\u0631\u0623\u062a \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0628 \u0646\u0635\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u062e\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0632\u064a \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629. \u062c\u0648\u064a\u0633 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0644 \u0623\u0648\u062a\u0633 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0644\u064a \u0648\u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0643\u064a\u062f \u0633\u0623\u0642\u0631\u0623 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649. \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0642\u062f \u064a\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u062c\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0647\u0648 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0648\u062a\u0633 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062d \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0629 \"\u0622\u0631\u064a\u0627\" \u062b\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628\u0643\u0629\u060c \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0629. I was disappointed in this Oates novel. Too much description going nowhere a lot of the time ~ the first few chapters the worst. Not like her other work. The most interesting element of the book was about the Love Canal case.

Ela tem sido lembrada nos \u00faltimos anos em todas as tradicionais listas de favoritos para o Nobel de Literatura, mas a Academia Sueca parece comprovar a sua antipatia por autores norte-americanos em detrimento dos europeus (o \u00faltimo nome laureado dos EUA foi a romancista Toni Morrison em 1993). A saga de tr\u00eas gera\u00e7\u00f5es de uma fam\u00edlia no per\u00edodo de 1950 a 1977, na cidade de Niagara Falls, \u00e9 o tema principal deste romance onde as vozes narrativas se alternam em cada cap\u00edtulo para mostrar os diferentes pontos de vista dos personagens, entre eles o jovem reverendo <---C>Gilbert Erskine</---C>, recentemente nomeado ministro da Igreja Presbiteriana de uma pequena cidade do estado de Nova York e rec\u00e9m-casado com Ariah Juliet Littrell. O casal decide passar a lua de mel em um luxuoso hotel na famosa \u00e1rea tur\u00edstica do rio Ni\u00e1gara, entre os Estados Unidos e Canad\u00e1. O cap\u00edtulo inicial descreve como Gilbert acorda cedo e, no dia seguinte ao casamento, decide se jogar nas fortes Cataratas da Ferradura (os motivos ficar\u00e3o claros no decorrer da trama). Logo, o cap\u00edtulo inicial do romance \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o de um suic\u00eddio provocado pelo efeito hipn\u00f3tico da for\u00e7a ensurdecedora das \u00e1guas, onde \"o desgra\u00e7ado indiv\u00edduo ao mesmo tempo cessa de existir e anseia se tornar imortal\". O trecho abaixo descreve a terr\u00edvel e bela for\u00e7a da natureza nos \u00faltimos momentos de Gilbert: \"As Cataratas rugiam t\u00e3o alto, agora, que se transformavam em algo hipn\u00f3tico, tranquilizador. Borrifos voavam por toda a parte, cegando-o, mas ele j\u00e1 n\u00e3o precisava enxergar. Os desgra\u00e7ados dos \u00f3culos escorregando em seu nariz. Sempre odiara \u00f3culos, mas a miopia havia sido diagnosticada quando ele tinha dez anos. A sina de G.! Num gesto do qual jamais em sua vida fora capaz, puxou fora os \u00f3culos e os lan\u00e7ou ao espa\u00e7o. J\u00e1 iam tarde! Nunca mais! De repente, estava na balaustrada. Em Terrapin Point. J\u00e1? Suas m\u00e3os tatearam at\u00e9 encontrar a trave mais alta da balaustrada e a agarraram. Ergueu o p\u00e9 direito, a sola do sapato deslizando, quase perdeu o equil\u00edbrio, mas conseguiu endireitar o corpo, como um acrobata se posicionando no alto da balaustrada, ao mesmo tempo que uma parte de sua mente se encolhia sem acreditar e lhe vinha um pensamento para confundi-lo: 'Isso n\u00e3o pode ser a s\u00e9rio, Gil! \u00c9 rid\u00edculo. Voc\u00ea se diplomou nos primeiros lugares em sua turma, eles lhe deram um carro novo, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode morrer agora!' Mas, tomado de orgulho, ele j\u00e1 passara por cima da balaustrada, estava na \u00e1gua, arrastado instantaneamente \u00e0 frente pelas poderosas corredeiras, como se fossem uma locomotiva, e em poucos segundos seu cr\u00e2nio se partira, o c\u00e9rebro e sua aparentemente incessante voz imortal extintos para sempre, como nunca antes; em dez r\u00e1pidos segundos, seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o parou, como um rel\u00f3gio cujo mecanismo tivesse sido esmagado. Sua espinha dorsal se quebrara, e quebrara de novo, e de novo como se fosse o osso da sorte de um peru, partido por uma crian\u00e7a em meio a risadas, e seu corpo era jogado de um lado para o outro, sem vida, como uma boneca de trapos; j\u00e1 no ponto onde despencavam a Cataratas da Ferradura, seu corpo era erguido e largado, erguido e largado de novo, em meio \u00e0s rochas, e sugado para baixo em meio \u00e0s \u00e1guas borbulhantes e aos pequenos e cintilantes arco-\u00edris, j\u00e1 fora das vistas da espantada e \u00fanica testemunha na balaustrada do Terrapin Point \u2014 embora em pouco fosse regurgitado no ponto onde despencavam as Cataratas e carregado rio abaixo at\u00e9 mais de um quil\u00f4metro depois das Corredeiras do Rodamoinho e para dentro do Redemoinho do Diabo, onde seria puxado para baixo, e sumiria de vista, sendo apanhado pelas \u00e1guas em espiral; o corpo partido giraria como uma lua enlouquecida, em \u00f3rbita, at\u00e9 que, em Sua Compaix\u00e3o, segundo Seus Des\u00edgnios, Deus lhe concederia o milagre da putrefa\u00e7\u00e3o, o corpo se encheria de gases, flutuaria para a superf\u00edcie do redemoinho espumante e seria libertado.\" (p\u00e1gs. 50 e 51) Portanto, apenas um dia ap\u00f3s o casamento, Ariah, evidentemente muito chocada com a situa\u00e7\u00e3o, fica conhecida na cidade como \"a noiva-vi\u00fava das cataratas\" e, durante toda a semana do per\u00edodo em que ocorrem as buscas pelo corpo do ex-marido, ela vaga pelas imedia\u00e7\u00f5es como um fantasma amaldi\u00e7oado. Surpreendentemente, acaba despertando o interesse de um rico e conceituado advogado local chamado Dick Burnaby com quem se casa novamente e forma uma fam\u00edlia com tr\u00eas filhos (Chandler, Royall e Juliet). Finalmente descobre a paix\u00e3o e uma vida feliz at\u00e9 que um processo conduzido pelo marido contra as poderosas ind\u00fastrias qu\u00edmicas locais, devido \u00e0 polui\u00e7\u00e3o provocada no meio ambiente e os efeitos na sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o de baixa renda (inspirado no caso real do desastre ambiental de love canal), provocar\u00e1 uma nova trag\u00e9dia em sua vida. Ser\u00e1 que ela \u00e9 mesmo um esp\u00edrito amaldi\u00e7oado? Fica clara a habilidade de Joyce Carol Oates com o estilo concentrado do conto. De fato, \"As Cataratas\" pode ser considerado como uma composi\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes (e excelentes) narrativas curtas sobre o marido e a personalidade de cada um dos tr\u00eas filhos, c\u00e9lulas praticamente autossuficientes, onde o fio condutor da fic\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a enigm\u00e1tica protagonista Ariah. A capa da edi\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira, produzida por Andrea Vilela de Almeida, foi muito feliz ao fugir da tenta\u00e7\u00e3o do lugar comum de apresentar grandes volumes de \u00e1gua despencando de uma altura de 800 metros, como foi o caso da maioria dos projetos gr\u00e1ficos no exterior. A imagem do equilibrista com o fundo nublado tamb\u00e9m remete ao tema do romance de forma mais sutil e original. ...more This is a big book.

I wished I hadn\u2019t read the plot summary on the inside of the cover though. It tells too much, so if you haven\u2019t read it yet, don\u2019t be tempted. Best not to know where the novel is going or how it can end. Best just to enter the novel innocently as Oates leads you, via a vision of the Horseshoe Falls, those \u201cshifting walls of fog, mist and spray rising in continuous billowing clouds out of the 180-foot Niagara Gorge\u201d. I had read Oates before, but not novels, short stories. I recalled her short stories as quite dense, though worth close attention. I never fell in love with any of them, though perhaps I should have done. This novel is intensely readable, dramatically written. Almost too accessible for my taste at first: the impressionistic sentence fragments irritated me: \u201cThe awkwardness, embarrassment, shame of such intimacy was new to her, like the intimacy of marriage. The \u2018marital bed\u2019. Nowhere to hide. His pungent Vitalis hair-oil and her coyly sweet Lily of the Valley cologne in collision.\u201d Perhaps that style, which is, after all, typical of much contemporary writing (even literary writing) would not have rankled had I not also read the Scotland on Sunday comment on the back jacket: \u201cHer prose is peerless.\u201d Peerless, eh? I did not think her prose was peerless. But I didn\u2019t linger over the style here so much as what was going on in the characters, because that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting, I think, and what engages the reader on an emotional level. Characterization-wise, she does something rather odd I haven\u2019t seen before \u2013 at least not quite like this. The narrative is third person, but regularly italics draw you into the head of one of the characters, so that in turn you identify closely with Dick Burnaby, and with his wife Ariah, and then with each of his three children. Each time one of the children was born, I felt the viewpoint was about to shift wholly into a single perspective, but it didn\u2019t. But the way she takes you inside different heads, even fleetingly, changes the way you see the whole canvas. For example, the second section of the novel ends in the third person, though the viewpoint is Dick Burnaby\u2019s. Then Section 3 begins in the first person (plural): \u201cWe went to live in a crumbling brick-and-stucco rowhouse. . . .\u201d So you think you\u2019re finally going to find yourself in the head of the \u2018true\u2019 narrator. It must be one of the children, mustn\u2019t it, or the wife Ariah telling the story now. But it\u2019s not (because \u201cWe were Ariah\u2019s TV audience\u201d). This is confusing to explain, I know, but it goes on with the first-person narrator (who is not the mother) describing all three children: \u201cThere was Chandler, of the three of us he was the eldest, and would always be so. there was Royall, seven years younger than his brother. There was Juliet, born in 1961. Which was too late.\u201d So who is telling the story? I think it must be Juliet, but hell \u2013 it's certainly not clear. Two pages later we\u2019re back to third-person narrative though the point of view is Royall\u2019s. She does the first-person trick again later when the family dog, Zarjo, gets lost, \u201cwe kept vigil for Zarjo on the front porch . . . We roamed ever farther from home . . . . None of us thinking whose puppy Zarjo had been. Who had brought Zarjo into our lives.\u201d And yet each person in the family is referred to by the impossible narrator from the outside. There is a \u2018we\u2019 here who is more than any of the characters. I\u2019d guess the \u2018we\u2019 is the Greek-chorus voice of the Family, more than any of its members and yet inside all of them. Perhaps this is the mark of a great novelist, that she can do this kind of thing without impeding the narrative flow in any way. You just accept what is happening, swept through each chapter by the forceful plot, by the chronological events. She is certainly explicitly aware of the way she is handling things, and leave you in no doubt that \u201c. . . this wasn\u2019t Hollywood and certainly this was no film. For, in films, there are close-ups, distance shots, \u2018master\u2019 shots, fade-outs and quick merciful cuts. There is an under-current of music signaling what emotion you are meant to feel. In what\u2019s called life, there is a continuous stream of time like the river rushing to The Falls, and beyond. No escape from that river.\u201d It\u2019s not true though. Not only would the book make a good film \u2013 lots of it is filmic \u2013 there are certainly close-ups, distance shots, \u2018master\u2019 shots, fade-outs and merciful cuts. And a film, too, can be driven by the continuous stream of time. In a film, I might question a couple of the plot elements. There are events I was somewhat unconvinced by, towards the end of the novel in particular. But I liked some of these: Juliet in particular was saved and I wanted her to be saved, so implausibility was not chiefly on my mind. It was very pleasurable reading, and I never stopped wanting to know what would happen next. Like Miller\u2019s All My Sons , there\u2019s an idea at the heart of the family in this novel which has to do with corruption and family and America and so on. You could study it in a college syllabus, though I do not think I would. Not an all-time classic, no. But very good indeed. Very good. ...more If I had more time (and less books on my TBR shelves) I would re-read this book. I think this novel requires a slow and steady approach, but that is difficult at times because you often feel like whispering, Enough already. Okay, maybe not whispering...", "Title": "The Falls"},
