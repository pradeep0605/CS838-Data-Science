LONG MAY THEY REIGN! <+++>The Demigod Files</+++> es un libro compa\u00f1ero a la primera saga del T\u00edo Rick: Percy Jackson and the Olympians y tiene tres historias cortas y unas cuantas entrevistas para partirse de la risa. La primera historia, The Stolen Charriot nos cuenta c\u00f3mo Clarisse debe recuperar el carruaje de su padre Ares para probar que es una digna hija de la guerra. El problema es que sus hermanastros, Fobos y Deimos, dioses del terror y el p\u00e1nico, lo han robado para que ella fracase. Eventualmente, Clarisse se encontrar\u00e1 por casualidad con Percy y juntos intentar\u00e1n derrotar a estos dioses menores. \u00bfQui\u00e9n dijo que un hijo de Poseid\u00f3n y una hija de Ares no pod\u00edan trabajar juntos? ;) En The Bronze Dragon todo empieza con un juego de Captura la Bandera en el que Percy y Annabeth est\u00e1n en bandos opuestos, lo que garantiza una competencia brutal. Cuando empieza el juego, Percy y Beckendorf, hijo de Hefesto, se internan en el bosque y se encuentran con unas hormigas gigantes, las myrmekes , que terminan arrastrando al hijo del dios herrero a su hormiguero. A partir de ah\u00ed, Percy tendr\u00e1 media hora antes de que las hormigas devoren a Beckendorf para pedir ayuda a Annabeth y a Silena Beauregard, hija de Afrodita. Juntos, y con la ayuda de un drag\u00f3n m\u00edtico de bronce que deber\u00e1n ensamblar, estos semidioses trabajar\u00e1n a contrarerloj para salvar la vida de su amigo. Esta historia me record\u00f3 much\u00edsimo a Festus, el drag\u00f3n que Leo ensambla en la segunda saga y, adem\u00e1s, mor\u00ed de amor por la relaci\u00f3n tontita entre Silena y Beckendorf. Tambi\u00e9n me re\u00ed un mont\u00f3n viendo c\u00f3mo Percy y Beckendorf hablaban sobre c\u00f3mo invitar a las chicas a los fuegos artificiales del 4 de Julio <3.

En esta historia, los semidioses son convocados al inframundo por Pers\u00e9fone, la esposa de Hades, quien los embarca en una misi\u00f3n por todos los recovecos del infierno griego para que atrapen a quien a robado una nueva espada de acero estigio que estaba siendo forjada para el dios de los muertos. De esta historia me gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo el trabajo en equipo de Percy, Thalia y Nico y lo conscientes que son de que, muchas veces, no son m\u00e1s que peones de los dioses, peones que hacen el trabajo sucio para evitar grandes guerras entre ellos.<---F> Y de Nico, ay</---F>... pobrecillo m\u00edo. El pobre en esta historia a\u00fan est\u00e1 tratando de probar su val\u00eda ante su padre, porque si hay algo dif\u00edcil en la vida es ser un hijo de Hades. ...more Let me preface this review by saying that I love the Percy Jackson and the Olympian Series.

Did Chiron have to look like Gaston from Beauty and the Beast? Annabeth looks ready for stores shelves as \"Tomboy Skipper\" (<---B>With New Adventures Included!</---B>). The stories themselves seemed a bit forced to me. The only thing I really liked about the book was the last segment teasing the reader with a preview of the final book. Riordan's voice seemed more like his own to me there than in the other shorts. Those felt as though he was trying to cram as much action as possible with no storyline to back them up. I had high hopes for this little ditty, but I was let down by what seemed like a gratuitous, money-making ploy. ...more I enjoyed reading this so much, I loved the short stories. Gotta say that my favorite was the one with the dragon, just because it had both Percy and Annabeth in it. The Demigod Files is more of a companion novel to the series than actually part of the series itself...I think. The book contains various mini-bios on a few of the main characters and gods. As well as a map of the camp grounds and a few other features that are sure to please any fan of the series. In my opinion, the biggest bonuses of the book are the three short stories that it contains.

Now, I'm not sure if the stories are completely separate from the overall plot of the series and therefore have no bearing, or if they do play a role in the things to come. Given that the characters present are in line with the most current book out, I'm led to believe that the stories are somewhat a part of the series. In which case, if you are reading the series you should check this book out. While not long at all, this book really wet my appetite until the final book comes out in May. Again, if you are a fan of Percy Jackson, then you have to take a look at this book. If you are new to the series, don't start with this one as it will give away many plot details.

Especially Annabeth's. All in all, I think the book was cool. The facts & mini-stories were all a good read and I had a nice time answering the quizzes, too. :) So, yeah... I think I won't be able to read The Last Olympian tomorrow since I have to study for our midterms next week... But then again, we'll never know when the spirit of procrastination will come. Harhar ...more There is a story in this book concerning the Big Three's children, Thalia, Nico, and Percy and their adventure in the Underworld that's my fave. Full of humor, danger, mythological power, and the annoying gods. This is not a necessary read following Battle of the Labyrinth but it's a must-read if you're a huge fan.

Percy Jackson & The Bronze Dragon *I loved the automaton in this; I mean, a fully functional, robotic, bronze dragon, crafted in the make of a Greek dragon! Pretty frigging cool! *I got to learn more about a few of the campers at Half-Blood that actually play huge roles in the final book *Plus, it gets kind of adorable in the romantic department, if you understand what I am laying down here *nudge nudge* Percy Jackson & The Sword of Hades *FINALLY! An adventure with all three kids from the mighty Three: the son of Hades, the son of Poseidon, and the daughter of Zeus, all together at last *In comparison to the previous two short stories, I think this one was the most fun, but also the most important in the grand scheme of things (key events happen here that explain a few things in the fifth and final book) *Also, it was so entertaining to see how the three worked together, since usually it was either Thalia and Percy or Nico and Percy but never the three of them together * Plus, this adventure took place in the Underworld, which in my opinion is just as or even more fascinating than Poseidon's kingdom under the sea So there you have it. My magical, point form review of this wicked book. If you are a fan of Percy Jackson don't miss out on this. You will guarantee to have a blast reading it. ...more Actual rating: 4/5 stars I got this for christmas from my lovely friend Patricia, thanks again!

Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades Loved. Loved. Loved. 5 stars! This quest brings together the kids of the 'Big Three', meaning Thalia, Nico and Percy (obviously). I love Lieutnant Thalia and you guys know I'm the biggest Nico girl! So happy to get another glimpse at these two. I also liked the story a lot in this one.

All three short stories are set after The Battle of the Labyrinth and before The Last Olympian . They were fabulous. They were spunky. It was just what I needed. Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot Okay, so maybe not that fabulous. To be honest, this wasn't that good. It lacked a certain finesse I was looking for. The writing seemed nothing extraordinary. The plot wasn't interesting and the action scenes were boring. But does this change my opinion of the whole series? Nah. Sometimes short stories are hard to craft. It also didn't have any Percabeth moments. That's mainly why I am disappointed. Who would enjoy only Clarisse and Percy as they argue almost the entire story? Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon This was epic. Just awesome. Everything was much better than before. I have a deep respect for the Hephaestus cabin. Those guys manage to be inventors and warriors at the same time. And reading about Silena and Beckendorf was so freaking bittersweet. On a more positive note, Percy's humor manages to make me smile since book one. \"I could tell they let there food rot before eating it. Somebody seriously needed to teach them about refrigerators.\" I love it when he talks about rotting food. But, most of all, the Percabeth moments were the best moments. \"If I was going to pick one person to reattach my head, I'd pick you.\" Awwwww. Aren't they the sweetest? Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades The Big Three demigods are in this one. Of course everything was badass. Of course I let out a fangirl squeal somewhere in the mix. The action scenes were feisty. I loved it. The Interviews Some of our favorite characters were given a interview. I loved how each person's dialogue really helped me understand their personalities. Each were only about two pages long and would've liked it if they were a bit longer. Favorite interview? Annabeth's. It really brought out the fangirl in me. Look below at my status updates for proof. Can I hug her? Please? Overall, a 4-star companion book. I personally believed the first story was lacking, but the other two were awesome. ...more \"Percy, you\u2019re a brave guy,\" she said. \"Just take the compliment.

REVIEW TO COME... Annabeth's interview, though :)) As usual, Rick Riordan delivers. I'm going through his books slowly this year, and it was really nice to see these stories again. The book contains three stories: Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot, Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon, and Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades. The book should be read between the fourth and fifth book of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series (The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian, respectively). --- The book is fun and light.

We get three short stories, one of which actually ties in to a later book and all of which give excellent background and world-expansion. Not to mention we get a map of Camp Half Blood! I wish that map had been included at the beginning of every Percy Jackson book - it's so helpful. Annabeth's school trunk was a nice touch, too. The interviews were fun, but the short stories are what really make the book worth getting. Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot shows us another side of Clarisse, which really humanizes her and helps give a fuller understanding of her character, especially as context for The Last Olympian. Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon was an excellent story and certainly helpful as background information for later books. It is the short story that does the most toward this goal. We get a bit of entertaining silliness between Percy and Annabeth involving their non-romance, and we get a peek into the characters of Silena, daughter of Aphrodite and Charles Beckendorf, son of Hephaestus. As well as a daring mission to restore a malfunctioning mechanical dragon. Need I say more? Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades was possibly my favorite, but that could just be because Nico was involved. Nico, Pery and Thalia, children of the Big Three, are summoned by Persephone and sent on mission in the Underworld. So much fun - by which I mean grave injuries, near-death experiences and wrenching emotional anguish. Totally up my alley. Also, Bob needs to make another appearance in the series. Soon. Definitely check this one out. ...more Now I'm a huge fantasy buff and I understand the Percy Jackson books are intended for children below 12, but still, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

If you look past the terrible dialogue, the stories are not that bad, I particularly enjoyed the second one, about the bronze dragon. Also I don't like the fact that the book has a first person perspective, having a young teenager describe the situations is bad, so bad...maybe a third person narration would have saved a bit. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book at all, in my opinion it butchers the greek mythology with crappy dialogue, over-the-top cliches and stereotypical characters! ...more I really liked all the short stories in this, they adding some things to the Percy Jackson world.

Para demigod atau anak-anak blasteran adalah contohnya. Terlahir dari hubungan antara dewa-dewi kuno dan manusia biasa menjadikan para blasteran sebagai anak-anak yang memiliki kekuatan super dan berbagai kelebihan yang melebihi orang-orang biasa di sekitarnya. Beberapa di antaranya mampu mengendalikan air (seperti Percy, putra Poseidon), memiliki akses tak terbatas ke dunia orang mati (Nico putra Hades), atau memiliki cambuk petir yang menyala mengerikan (Thalia dong, siapa lagi). Anak-anak blasteran ini juga bisa melihat di balik kabut, esensi dewata yang menghalangi manusia biasa untuk bisa melihat hal-hal (biasanya mengerikan) yang seharusnya tidak mereka lihat, monster misalnya. Tetapi, konsekuensi mengerikan mengikuti anak-anak blasteran ini. Terlahir sebagai mahkluk setengah-setengah membuat darah dan bau tubuh mereka sebagai aroma yang memancing para monster. Entah ingin membalas dendam kepada orang tua dewa-dewi mereka atau karena tubuh blasteran memang lezat, monster-monster dari kedalaman Tartarus (nerakanya Yunani kuno) terus menerus mewujud dan mengejar mereka. Kekuatan yang awalnya terasa menyenangkan, akhirnya berubah menjadi kutukan. Jika pernah membaca serial Percy Jackson, akan dijelaskan bahwa anak-anak blasteran ini kemudian dilindungi dan dilatih di Perkemahan Blasteran agar bisa melawan para monster. Sudah tak terhitung berapa kali Annabeth dan kawan-kawannya melawan monster-monster ganas dari dunia kuno, dan\u2014tanpa mereka sadari\u2014turut menyelamatkan dunia. Dalam The Demigod Files, kita akan disuguhi 3 petualangan pendek Percy Jackson yang rentang waktu terjadinya kira-kira menyisip antara buku kedua hingga buku kelima. Ceritanya pun nggak jauh-jauh dari dewa-dewi yang suka menindas dan berbuat seenaknya, monster-monster gawat yang tiba-tiba mengamuk, atau perjalanan ke dunia bawah yang serba menyenangkan (for Nico I mean). Namanya juga cerita pendek, jadi jelas dong kurang puas banget bacanya karena sepertinya Om Riordan menulisnya kurang panjang (haiyah dibolak-balik aja wkwkwk), untung saja selera humor penulis masih mewarnai cerita-cerita buku ini. Ada petualangan Percy ketika membantu Clarisse menemukan kereta perang ayahnya, trus kisah pendek ketika Percibeth belum jadian, serta jalan-jalan seram di dunia bawah untuk menemukan tongkat Hades. Seperti biasa, kedamaian dunia berada di tangan anak-anak blasteran ini. Kisah paling menarik menurut saya adalah \u201cTongkat Serapis\u201d yang dijadikan bonus di buku ini. Jika pembaca sudah membaca The Kane Chronicles 3, ada bonus cerita ketika Percy bertemu dengan Carter. Yup, akhirnya penyihir Mesir dan blasteran Yunani dipersatukan! Nah, di kisah Tongkat Serapis ini, giliran Saddie Kane dan Annabeth Chase yang dipertemukan di kereta bawah tanah untuk mengejar cangkang berkepala tiga yang ternyata merupakan kunci dari kebangkitan sesosok dewa kuno yang sangat berbahaya. Dalam sejarahnya, Mesir memang pernah dikuasai oleh dinasti Firnaun yang berasal dari Yunani, yakni Dinasti Ptolemy. Pada masa-masa itulah, kedua dewa-dewi di dua peradaban berbeda itu pernah dipersatukan. Satu dewa local bernama Serapis kemudian ditasbiskan sebagai dewa utama di Alexandria, mengungguli semua dewa-dewi Yunani dan Mesir yang lebih kuno. Pertemuan dua peradaban berbeda ini tentu saja sangat menarik. Jika ada yang bosan sama kisah Percy Jackson yang begitu-begitu saja (walau saya yakin tidak ada yang bosan membaca petualangan Percy dkk), kisah pertemuan antara Mesir dan Yunani ini akan menjadi selingan yang sangat segar. Dengan menggabungkan keduanya, Om Rick jadi memiliki stok ide cerita yang lebih banyak. Kita harapkan saja akan semakin banyak kisah Percy dkk yang akan ditulis Om Rick karena kita sudah terlalu jatuh cinta kepada seri blasteran Yunani ini. Jika pembaca sudah membaca seri-seri tulisan Om Rick, belum lengkap rasanya kalau belum membaca The Demigod Files. Yah, hitung-hitung sambil nungguin The Blood of Olympus terbit. Petunjuk penggunaan: Sampul buku ini warnanya sangat bagus. Seolah seperti tengah memandang ganggang atau rumput laut hijau di perairan dangkal di pantai perpasir putih. Coba beri sampul mika bening, efeknya akan semakin dramatis. Great design, Miss Kartika. ...more \"Percy, you're a brave guy,\" she said. \"Just take the compliment. I swear, is it so hard?\u201d I really enjoyed this. It was a pretty short and fun read for fans of Percy Jackson and I love my Percy . The only problem I had with it, was the writing style. Strangely, it was amateur and felt rushed; nothing like Riordan's writing in the Percy Jackson novels. When I was reading the Sword of Hades, I realized I have yet another problem when I read. I'm engrossed with pain and suffering. No, not grosse \"Percy, you're a brave guy,\" she said. \"Just take the compliment. I swear, is it so hard?\u201d I really enjoyed this.

I've reread the part in the Sword of Hades where Percy has his shoulder wound at least 4 times... And I just read the book for first time last night. I have problems. I really enjoyed the story though. It was definitely my favorite part of the Demigod Files. I also liked the Dragon story a lot. Specifically for two reasons: 1) We see Beckendorf and Selena. It makes (The Last Olympian) (view spoiler) [their deaths more emotional. (hide spoiler) ] 2) We know how the bronze dragon *cough*Festus*cough* came to be. This book was just plain old fun. ...more 3.5 but one star up since I like Riordan. Normally I don't go for short stories because I almost always think there is more that needs to be said after it's over. But I figured I'd give it a go since it was short and I needed something that wasn't going to take a lot of time. It has two or three short stroies, some interviews with the main characters, and pictures/profiles of our favorite characters. After watching the movie I thought indignantly that this is how I thougth the characters really l 3.5 but one star up since I like Riordan.

Except for Athena who has black hair when I thought it was blonde, but I'm not too picky on her. The only character I thought looked the way I imaged it in the movie was maybe Chiron. The short stories were fun and I didn't have that feeling of wanting to know more because I already know what happens to our heroes. Riordan didn't have to develop any of the characters either because he already did in the other books. Even though I read this after reading all the series I thought it was nice to see all the characters again. ...more Shhhh I quietly private-read it on bookstore, but it was open and yes, they allowed to private read on that bookstore. But I miss that bookstore now, they renovated it and it became smaller and reading space where you can hangout was removed. So I have to move to a new hangout place where they allowed to private read. Buhahahah I'm cheap, I know. And this the only Riordan book that we didn't bought. Gahh, way to expensive than normal thing, because of that glowy-shiny thing on its cover.

It's a side story of Percy, darn, how I miss Percy the old-cute Percy (not literary old) and his adventure outside Camp Halfblood and his encounter to some minor Gods, Camp Halfblood mates, ex-Camp Halfblood mates, Hunters and many more. Adventures, magic sunflower and unicorns will he able fulfill his 16th birthdate curse? Oh yes, he did, we all freaking know that. But then, a cute side story and a few minutes what's stopping you from reading it.
