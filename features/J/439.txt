In case you are less obsessed than we are, here is the one I mean: And in case you doubt my eternal devotion, I did this for my birthday this past year: Anyway, my sis & I even built a special shelf in my apartment for this book to rest its glowing head upon. BUT, because I am almost unbearably lame, I have yet to take it off of its perch and read it. Why? Perhaps because I am so in awe of Bill Watterson that I am afraid to sully its glorious pages with my dirty fingertips. Perhaps because merely to behold it brings me more joy than reading almost anything probably could. Perhaps. But eventually I will read it. And I will love it more than probably any other book in my library. ...more Everyone loves Calvin and Hobbes. I do, too. It's not just funny, it's also very wise. Tongue-in-cheek philosophy and sociology. Usually the best part of the newspapers that choose to publish it, newspapers that in turn got better per definition than newspapers who don't. But what about Donald and Hobbes ? Funny, and a little bit scary. Take a look for yourself. :-D I finished this some time ago, but I wanted to mark it here as one of the highlights of the year. I consider Calvin and Hobbes my dear friends and I hope they are still having fun someplace with a lot of snow. I don't have a kid of my own, but if I did, I would surely buy this for his shelves (I borrowed mine from the Library) The philosopher John Calvin... ...and the philosopher Thomas Hobbes... ...with chillingly apt quotes for the day. Aw, forget 'em! Look at this Calvin and his friend Hobbes: better philosophers and way more funny. There was big news in the comics world this week when we learned that the reclusive Bill Watterson, author of the beloved Calvin and Hobbes cartoon who has been retired for almost 20 years, has been quietly collaborating on a new comic strip, Pearls Before Swine. Calvin and Hobbes ended in 1995, and for those who were born after that, I think it's hard to convey how much loss was felt when Watterson stopped drawing. I mean, I felt genuine loss.

Calvin and Hobbes ended in 1995, and for those who were born after that, I think it's hard to convey how much loss was felt when Watterson stopped drawing. I mean, I felt genuine loss. I LOVED Calvin and Hobbes and I read it in the paper every day. (Kids, this was back when people actually read newspapers.) I stopped reading the comics page after Watterson retired -- nothing else compared to his brilliant and hilarious stories of a rambunctious boy and his imaginary pet tiger. A few years ago I was thrilled that someone had cataloged all of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoons into a database so you could search for keywords. Oh, what fun I had looking up old favorites! I own the complete collection of C&H, and it is delightful to page through (I have so many fond memories of reading this comic that it's a trip back to my childhood), but if you are looking for a specific strip, it is hard to find in the books unless you know the date. But hooray for the internet search engine! If you have never read Calvin & Hobbes, I highly recommend them to, well, everyone. Watterson's stories are clever and humorous and combine elements of philosophy, history, sociology, psychology, and the fun of being an energetic kid. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to finish my game of CalvinBall. ...more Since: Because: Also: But: So: In conclusion: if there was a better part of my childhood than reading these these comics, i honestly can't think of it. these stretched my brain as a kid. never pandered to his audience. i learned so many words and references from these. i specifically remember looking up transmogrify, kafka and phlegm in my mom's giant dictionary, and later on laughing when i learned about the philosophers calvin and hobbes. reading these is probably a big part of how i ended up being the kind of person who would enjoy a site if there was a better part of my childhood than reading these these comics, i honestly can't think of it. these stretched my brain as a kid. never pandered to his audience. i learned so many words and references from these. i specifically remember looking up transmogrify, kafka and phlegm in my mom's giant dictionary, and later on laughing when i learned about the philosophers calvin and hobbes. reading these is probably a big part of how i ended up being the kind of person who would enjoy a site like this. i was talking to a friend the other night for several hours, and somehow it came up at some point that we shared all the major points of our personality, and we both attributed those aspects to having read these. they make you the kind of person who's not just willing to accept things without questioning them. the way watterson taps into the different sides of his brain to make all these different characters is so obvious and endearing that it's no wonder he never leaves his house these days for fear of being mobbed by adoring fans. i never realized it until much more recently, but these books also taught me that it's possible not to sell out. the story of watterson being approached for huge marketing deals and turning every one of them down is really inspiring. i know personally i'd buy any official calvin and hobbes merchandise i could get my hands on, even now, but the fact that none exists is truly great in its way. please please please read calvin and hobbes. you can borrow my copy. ...more Do we choose our imaginary friends or do they choose us? If Calvin chose Hobbes, how do we explain episodes like this one: This comic pattern turns up throughout the story of C&H; Calvin reveals an overwhelmingly self-serving viewpoint and Hobbes rolls his eyes so hard he risks brain damage. If Calvin is as selfish as he seems, wouldn't he be tempted to dream up a friend who coddles his ego? Yet Hobbes is far from a yes-tiger, which suggests Calvin realizes how unrealistic his world-view is. Do we choose our imaginary friends or do they choose us? If Calvin chose Hobbes, how do we explain episodes like this one: This comic pattern turns up throughout the story of C&H; Calvin reveals an overwhelmingly self-serving viewpoint and Hobbes rolls his eyes so hard he risks brain damage. If Calvin is as selfish as he seems, wouldn't he be tempted to dream up a friend who coddles his ego? Yet Hobbes is far from a yes-tiger, which suggests Calvin realizes how unrealistic his world-view is. He knows that a friend worth having will serve as both co-conspirator and skeptic. And the series often reaches hilarious heights when it plays on this dynamic: Hobbes might check Calvin's delusions, but he's also the only character who takes them seriously or even understands what his friend is about. For a child that barely fits into the world around him, that's a big deal. Calvin's parents and peers generally don't get him: The irony of the comic is that the reader can see the comic brilliance that informs Calvin while the inhabitants of his world only see weird and willful. Calvin refuses to tailor his antics to match his audience so he can't serve as a popular class clown and he refuses to compromise his creative vision so he acts a hellion despite his intelligence. It is perilously rare that Calvin's sense of humor clicks with another character (besides Hobbes of course), which is part of why the following comic rocks the funny bone so hard: In a lot of ways, Hobbes shows us what Calvin might be like when he matures; with softened ambitions, an understanding of the need for responsibility and a greater empathy for other people. Hobbes is also a subtle humorist who doesn't require immediate reaction: And there are other things that make Hobbes seem more adult. While Calvin looks at girls with disgust, Hobbes dreams of smooches. Hobbes is taller, more athletic and possesses a more practical strategic mind and he generally gets the better of Calvin when they compete; be it in water-balloon battles, checkers or football (Calvinball obviously doesn't have traditional winners and losers.) Why dream up a friend so much more capable than oneself? Because passing these mature attributes off on someone else frees Calvin to revel in childhood and childishness. Calvin knows adulthood looms. He knows that once he grows up there's no going back. Having Hobbes as a best friend means he can celebrate egotism and immaturity while still developing his social and creative skills for when he inevitably has to let his childhood go. By imagining what Hobbes would do or say, Calvin builds a model for his future self without betraying his present values. Calvin is so dedicated to maintaining his immature persona that, in my favorite story-arc of the series, he passes the credit for his greatest academic achievement to Hobbes: But while Hobbes gives Calvin a model of who he might be one day, he still has a psychological leap to make. Calvin fights responsibility with every fiber of his being, often at great cost in terms of the esteem and understanding of his parents. Near the end of the series Bill Watterson points to how Calvin might find common ground with adulthood; sometimes all it takes is to have an authority figure take you serious and give you a choice. And who knows, the authority figure might get something out of it too: Edited 2-17-2017 ...more Now what can I say about this but apart from its amazing. The box set is massive (and heavy).

Now for anyone who has not read Calvin and Hobbes (where have you been!) you will at least recognise the characters if not what they do. Basically you have a six year old boy Calvin, a precocious little boy who's imagination runs wild. Here you share in his world as he is enjoys life while trying to make sense of the world around him. All the time sharing his adventures and observations with his imaginary best friends Hobbes a huge equally precocious tiger. Now this book represents the complete work by Bill Watterson of his Calvin and Hobbes comics from November 18, 1985 to December 31, 1995 and as sad as the fact is that there will be no more you have to admire the fact they have survived so long and stayed so fresh to this day (and no doubt beyond). If ever you want something to life your heart and make you smile the comic adventures of Calvin and Hobbes must surely be considered. ...more Need I really explain to you why I gave Calvin & Hobbes a five-star rating? If you grew up during the eighties and nineties or were sentient during that time period, or if you are sentient now and have access to the Internet or if you have ever had a friend who knows what good stuff is, then you know that Calvin & Hobbes is a wonderful, beautiful, hilarious, perfect thing.

If you grew up during the eighties and nineties or were sentient during that time period, or if you are sentient now and have access to the Internet or if you have ever had a friend who knows what good stuff is, then you know that Calvin & Hobbes is a wonderful, beautiful, hilarious, perfect thing. I grew up on this. In the early nineties, I woke up every morning and stomped to the front door to retrieve the newspaper and spend some quality time with the comics section while eating my Lucky Charms or Count Chocula (the closest thing to Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs I could lay my hands upon). I delighted in the exploits of Calvin and his pet tiger, Hobbes, who was obviously a real and ferocious but lovable beast, but appeared as a stuffed animal to Calvin's parents, peers and superiors. When I opened my front door after walking home from the bus stop, I always wished I would be greeted with a tiger attack. When I got a snow day off from school, I strove for the creative and technical brilliance of Calvin's snow sculptures. Like Calvin and Hobbes, all of my games and sports eventually morphed transmogrified into Calvinball. Spaceman Spiff was my favorite astronaut hero. Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuttttttttttttttt...... What's interested me in my rereading of the complete collection of Calvin & Hobbes is that it's not written for kids. I mean, it is. It's completely appropriate for children. But there is so much depth and subtlety to the comic that I missed as a kid. Spaceman Spiff was my favorite as a young reader, but what I find appreciating even more as an adult is the culture criticism and commentary. There's a lot of focus on the media and the environment. It speaks for itself: But my absolute favorite part of reading through the canon of Calvin & Hobbes is trying to figure this precocious kid out. The most obvious characterization for him would be that he is a sweet but mischievous kid with an imaginary best friend. But there's a darker element to Calvin and his tiger. At times, the strip makes you wonder: is there something wrong with Calvin? Should he be receiving some intense therapy? There is one particular story arc that felt very unsettling to me. Calvin begins receiving letters from an unknown writer; they come marked with a skull and crossbones and they must be decoded. And what happens, of course, is that the letters are actually coming from Calvin's own house! Which means that Hobbes wrote and sent them! Which, if you recall, is impossible, because Hobbes is an imaginary tiger! And Calvin honestly does not remember writing and sending these messages to himself, which means that he probably has a serious case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (a.k.a. multiple personalities). So the question becomes: what sort of tragedy has Calvin suffered that has fractured his personality thusly? It's a troubling question, for me, at least. One final word of praise for Mr. Watterson. He knew when to quit. After ten years of writing about a funny kid and his imaginary tiger, he was able to realize that he was running out of steam. As much as I hate to admit it, the last year of Calvin & Hobbes displayed a downward spiral in creativity and cleverness. Like so many others find themselves unable to do, Watterson retired his strip before it soured. And another congrats to him for not licensing his images to be plastered all over lunchboxes and t-shirts and bastardized in endless movie adaptations. (Yes, this means that if you have a sticker on your Chevy of Calvin pissing on a Ford logo, you are in breach of copyright; also, don't be stupid.) Calvin will always be my favorite megalomaniacal and possibly schizophrenia-plagued child. ...more \"It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy... let's go exploring!\" It's a magical world; there's treasure everywhere, the days are just packed and scientific progress goes boink. But something under the bed is drooling. Weirdos from another planet? Homicidal psycho jungle cat? Revenge of the baby-sat? Or an attack of the deranged mutant killer monster snow goons? Nope. Calvin & Hobbes. Yukon ho! Calvin and Hobbes had a huge cultural influence on the Pacific Northwest anarchist scene (the comic strip is believed to take place in the Pacific Northwest) and the political undertones of the comic strip are fairly obvious but also severely overlooked, but such is the case with all revolutionary art. With his talent, Watterson could have became an underground messiah churning out inaccessible cult-classic graphic novels, instead he chose to struggle against a highly corrupt and controlling news Calvin and Hobbes had a huge cultural influence on the Pacific Northwest anarchist scene (the comic strip is believed to take place in the Pacific Northwest) and the political undertones of the comic strip are fairly obvious but also severely overlooked, but such is the case with all revolutionary art. With his talent, Watterson could have became an underground messiah churning out inaccessible cult-classic graphic novels, instead he chose to struggle against a highly corrupt and controlling newspaper comic publisher's syndicate in order to see his vision realized of a newspaper comic serial that harked back to the glory days before the mass-produced minimalism Garfield and the preachiness of Doonesbury . What is so amazing about Watterson's work is how real it is. The comic succeeds as such a profound meditation on life because it is so humble and unpretentious, cut from the fabric of daily existence. Watterson's cynicism is grounded in a love of childlike awe of the natural world and the unfettered human spirit. Unlike most adult authors, Watterson writes about childhood with honesty and realism rather than saccharine romanticism. Yes, Calvin has idyllic fun exploring the world outside him but he is also intimately oppressed and exploited by capitalist institutions on no uncertain terms, it's in spite of and because of this suffering that he cherishes reality and it's this love of freedom and natural beauty that is at the heart of Calvin's cynicism. Calvin's father is much like Kaczynski or John Zerzan, a misanthropic radical trapped in a soul-crushing white collar existence. The professional career demands of Calvin's father hypocritically force his mother to be the face and the muscle-power behind Calvin's disciplining. Calvin's Dad sees his son turning away from revolutionary ideals and towards the materialism and cynicism of modern capitalism, but what can Calvin's Dad do? Like most children Calvin spends more time with the television set than with his father. On the flip-side, Hobbes, (Calvin's imaginary friend) is Calvin's inner self, the self Calvin's father wishes Calvin would be. Hobbes follows the path of the tao and looks upon humanity with a bemused skepticism. Calvin bonds most with Hobbes by walking through the wilderness and contemplating life in a very peripatetic fashion. In true to William Blake, Hobbes is a \"tiger of wrath\", and when developers begin destroying the woods he and Calvin cherish, he advices Calvin to tamper with construction equipment. We can't help but smile at Calvin's youthful cynicism, materialism, and selfishness because we were like that too as a child. Other children's authors such as Milne portray childhood as some pure ideal state uncontaminated by modern society, but Calvin is the young Winston Smith who threw a temper tantrum to get his mother and infant sister's share of the chocolate rations. Calvin is certainly the working class and his cruel teacher Ms. Wormwood, abusive playground bully Moe, and baby-sitter Rosalyn are symbols of our abject and intimate powerlessness. And like all children, Calvin uses his imagination as a therapeutic force in dealing with the trauma of intimate exploitation. (My all-time favorite strip portrays Calvin's daily routine of compulsive 'education' as a series if vividly illustrated vignettes, from running on a giant gerbil wheel to sitting on an assembly line with his cranium unscrewed as viscous green fluids are pumped into his brain) Calvin also reminds me of Tiqqun's take on school shooters in Theory of the Bloom , (at one point Calvin fantasizes about blowing up his school) let's hope in adulthood Calvin found a more creative way to maximize his destructive potential. The best thing about this comic is that Watterson drug his feet at the idea of merchandising because he thought it would cheapen his artistic expression. And he was right, the comic's legacy is all the better with the conspicuous absence of Calvin and Hobbes printed pajamas lining Goodwill shelves across the country. This has also created a very interesting subculture of underground and unauthorized bootleg Calvin and Hobbes memorabilia, much of it quite crude and low-brow but some of it rather creative. ...more Oh Calvin, you lazy, self-absorbed, spastic, nihilistic, narcissistic brat.... It has been a good 15 years (in college) since I read this strip, and then only sporadically. I had no clue as to the cutting social commentary that came out of precocious Calvin's mouth on a regular basis.

In some ways, finishing the complete collection feels like goodbye, but in many ways it is not, since I know that I will be re-reading it until my final days. ...more \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u062f\u0639 \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0647 \u0643\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0628\u062d\u0632\u0646 :( \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0647 \u0644\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u060c \u062a\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0646\u064a \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u0645\u062c\u0644\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0645\u064a\u0643\u064a ..\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0644 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u0644\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0648\u0647\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0632 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0635\u062f\u0642\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0627\u0631 \u0643\u0644 \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0635\u0628\u0627\u062d\u0627 \u0648\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0627 :') \u0627\u062f\u0639\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0648\u0636\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0636\u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u0623\u062a\u0647 \u0643 \u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0646\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0633\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u062e\u0641\u0647 \u0648\u0643\u0648\u0645\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u0634\u062d\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0628\u0634\u0634\u0634\u062f\u0647 \u060c #\u0643\u062a\u0631\u0648\u0627_\u0645\u0646_\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0643 \u064a\u0627\u062c\u062f\u0639\u0627\u0646 :D :D Hobbes and Calvin were My good companions in hard times. Even though it is hard to admit, those hard times were my early 20's. I met them in comic strips in my daily. I knew they were special the first time I saw them. And I am really Happy That i got to know them. Bill Watterson will always be the best thing that ever happened to earth. Thank you for your wonderful gift. About this complete collection, This book is 2 weeks of Pure fun. Read if you can get your hands on it. Thank you Bill. \"It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy... Let's go exploring!\" Nothing I can write, will truly reflect the genius of this spellbinding, mesmerizing and all-so sweet collection of comic strips by Bill Watterson. A true masterpiece, in all senses of the word. My son absolutely LOVES Calvin and Hobbes. I never really read it as a kid, but my husband did, and I'm so happy he introduced it to our family-- even though Calvin can be a bad role model at times. My favorite strips are those where he plays with Susie, his annoying next door neighbor. We laugh out loud and I bet are teaching some good vocabulary at the same time! This is why I haven't been doing much productive reading lately... heh heh. :) Still the best in the game 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 If Hitler is going to burn books again, this one has to be saved. In my opinion, this is the most important work that ever came out of pop-culture. \"How do I love Calvin and Hobbes? Let me count the ways. Firstly, Calvin reminds me so much of my 4-year-old, as they both are highly intelligent yet have their own highly developed sense of naughtiness. I love the way Watterson integrates Calvin's imagination into the strip; the glimpses of an adult Calvin and Susie, or the creatures who live in Calvin's stomach, are priceless. I love the way Watterson uses Calvin to simultaneously critique the media-obsessed culture AND to celebrate the simple \"How do I love Calvin and Hobbes? Let me count the ways.

I love the way Watterson uses Calvin to simultaneously critique the media-obsessed culture AND to celebrate the simple joys of the outdoors, or goofing off. It's like there are two Calvins, the TV junkie and the outdoorsman ... like some adults I know. The advantages of this huge box set are many. We get to enjoy full-size daily strips and huge Sunday strips in full color. By laying out every strip from beginning to end we can see the continuity of themes but also the progression in style; the characters are drawn differently in the beginning, enough that my daughter was taken aback by it. We also see how Watterson experimented with the space available to him; by Volume 3 he was conciously trying to utilize the space in more dynamic ways. There isn't much downside to this collection. The volumes are kind of enormous, and it can be difficult to curl up in bed with one. (although it's a great meta-moment when you are curled up in bed with Volume 3, reading the strip in which Calvin and Hobbes are curled up in bed reading comics). And there are no tabs in the slipcase to help you remove the books. In these regards, I think the Complete Peanuts set is somewhat superior, in that the books are smaller and are easier to handle.\" ...more When I was in eleventh grade, there was a Calvin & Hobbes strip in my Spanish book (and in Spanish, of course). The teacher asked who would be willing to try translating it to English, and I did it flawlessly. Senora was very impressed; I just felt like a fraud. For, you see, I didn't actually translate it, I just knew exactly what it said.

For, you see, I didn't actually translate it, I just knew exactly what it said. I got my first Calvin & Hobbes book when I was in sixth grade, through one of those mail-away book brochures they hand out in class. That was about ten years ago; since then, I've read every single published strip at least once (but odds are I've read it upwards of three times). As I get older and re-read these comics, I find so many jokes that I missed the first time (and I still delight in the ones I did understand, too). It's impossible to say what kind of person I would be today without these comics. I can go months without thinking of Calvin and Hobbes, but the sight of a bulldozer never fails to remind me of the strip about the condominium project in the woods. Hearing about a burglary always makes me think of Calvin's mother's panic-stricken face when they get home from vacation and find the tv missing. \"What fun is it being cool if you can't wear a sombrero?\" made me feel a little bit better about growing up uncool, and Susie's \"sticks and stones\" strip let me know it was okay to be upset about it sometimes too. Calvin & Hobbes touched me in so many small ways that I'll probably never realize all of them. (For the record, after class I 'fessed up to my Spanish teacher. She thought it was funny.) ...more I've wanted this massive, gorgeous collection since it came out in 2005.

My brother (who still lives nearby) said \"yeah, he lives there... keeps kind of a low profile.\" Anyway, Calvin and Hobbes is a total treat: the adventures of the 6 year old and his \"pretend\" tiger Hobbes are hilarious. The author Bill Watterson did every artistic thing (sketch, draw, color, letter) himself, and never sold any rights for merchandising. It's a work of integrity, and more than that, there are few comic strips that can equal how it raises both philosophical questions and belly laughs. ...more<+++>The Complete Calvin and Hobbes</+++>", "Title": "The Complete Calvin and Hobbes"},
