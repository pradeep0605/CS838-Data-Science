Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.\" Twenty-two years ago, I was captivated by these words. They reached off of the page and grabbed me, pulling me into a world so vivid, so real that it seems as though I should be able to visit it on my next vacation. It was a long book for an eleven year old to read, but read it I did, and have many times since, both awaiting and dreading this day. The day when \"The Wheel of Time\" came to an end. It is hard to say exactly how I feel about such a thing. I have spent two thirds of my entire life wishing that this series would never end, but at the same time, dying to read its conclusion. And now, as I look to tomorrow, for the first time since my childhood, I no longer have a \"Wheel of Time\" book to look forward to. Everything that begins inevitably has an end, and \"The Wheel of Time\" is no exception. It is over. It is done. It has come to an end. And oh what an end it was. When Robert Jordan died, I felt as though I'd lost a good friend. The two of us had never met, nor had we ever spoken, but I feel that I knew him. The books that he left behind are full of his personality, his humor, his views on the world. His books have brought me together to meet some of my dearest friends, and have influenced my career choices. Jordan and \"The Wheel of Time\" have had a huge impact on my life. I was apprehensive of any author taking the helm and finishing the story in his absence. You don't just replace an old friend with a shiny new one like nothing has happened. However, Brandon Sanderson, while not perfect, has exceeded my expectations in finishing these final volumes. I am grateful to him for taking the time and the effort to do the absolute best that he was capable of doing to make these books as good as they have turned out. I don't even know how to describe this book. I just don't know the words for it. Epic is so overused these days that it has almost become meaningless. Exquisite, maybe? No, no, that sounds like I'm plagiarizing the book. Glorious. I'll go with that one. This book is glorious . It is magnificent. It is the culmination of a fourteen book series that has spanned across twenty-two years of my life, and its end left me teary-eyed and speechless. I like to avoid saying that a book is the best that I have ever read, because such generalizations are usually rather silly. Not to mention the fact that without the thirteen books that come before this one to build such a firm, solid foundation for it, \"A Memory of Light\" is rather meaningless on its own. However, within my all-time favorite book series, this one has become my favorite book, and it is one of the most spectacular endings to any story I have ever had the pleasure to read. \"A Memory of Light\" is the Last Battle, Tarmon Gai'don, in all its glory and terrible splendor. Supporting characters bite it by the dozens in ridiculously heroic ways, the world comes inches from destruction, balancing upon the choices of a single man, Rand Al'thor. Trollocs have flooded out of the Blight, laying entire nations to waste, and the combined forces of the Light meet them on all fronts, but when Demandred arrives in the thick of battle, leading the combined might of Shara, they are forced into retreat. Everything falls upon Mat Cauthon, the only general remaining on the field. He gathers everything to the Fields of Merrilor for a last, desperate stand against the forces of the Shadow. There is no retreat. There is victory, or there is death. Men, women, children, the elderly, everyone who can hold a weapon, fight, or help in any way flocks to his banners to defend the world from the oncoming tide of oblivion as Mat plays the greatest game of his life. He matches his skills as a general against those of Demandred, the greatest general that the Shadow has ever had to offer. Outnumbered four to one, Mat's only hope lies in his luck, and in the timely arrival of the Horn of Valere. Demandred rants and raves, shouting for Rand to show himself and fight, and many champions of the Light throw themselves against him, seeking to behead the beast, the seeming only chance of victory, only to fall to his blade. Characters begin dropping left and right, some of them I expected, but others came as a complete shock to me. Meanwhile, at Shayol Ghul, Rodel Ituralde and his army defend the mountain as Rand goes inside to face the Dark One himself, bringing Moiraine and Nyneave with him. Close to the Dark One, time changes, and mere hours stretch into weeks on the outside, as the forces of the Light are pounded nearly to submission. He and the Dark One struggle against one another, a mere mortal standing up to a universal force, and finally coming to the realization of what his purpose in the grand scheme of things has always been. In the end, triumph over the Shadow can only be bought at the price of hundreds of thousands of brave, heroic lives. For even if Rand succeeds, the armies of the enemy still threaten the world. The Good? This book is all battles, characters dying heroic deaths, doing things that are ridiculously awesome, and generally blowing up just about everything . Normally, a book that was all action, and not much else, would be a bad thing. But, the thing is, \"The Wheel of Time\" has earned this ending. It has earned the right to give us nothing but action for an entire book through thirteen previous books building up to this point. One could say that the entire book is in, and of itself, just one gigantic, explosive climax, though it does still have a narrative, and build to a glorious climax all of its own. Even now, at the end, characters still show that they can learn, grow and develop as people. Rand, Egwene, Perrin, Mat, Pevara, Logain, and even Olver all have very satisfying character growth throughout the fight. This book is exquisitely written. Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job of filling in for Robert Jordan. I cannot thank him enough for working so hard to complete these final three volumes as well as he did. It is true that Sanderson's grasp of military tactics is not as keen as Jordan's were, and so he did something brilliant. He didn't focus on the tactics as Jordan likely would have. He focused on the characters instead, and that more than fills in his lack of experience with arraying armies and the like. I found myself cheering out loud in many places, and getting choked up at others. It was hard to see characters that I have grown up with dying by the handfuls, but the things that they did, and the feats that they accomplished were such a fitting end to them. This entire book was pure, unadulterated, fan service from page one to the end. It was the payoff for all of our faithful reading and waiting. Everything you ever wanted to see happen in a \"Wheel of Time\" book does and more. Almost every single character that has played more than a bit role in the series, and is still alive at this point, did something heroic. No one was left out. Everyone was the hero, even nameless, faceless farmers who took up weapons to fight. And I really liked that. The Bad? There is only one teeny, tiny nitpick I have about this book. A few of the early battles in the book, before Mat's last stand, do get a little repetitive and some people may find them to be a little boring because of it. But once the true last battle begins, I promise you, you will be riveted and completely unable to force yourself to put it down. This was a glorious climax to a glorious series. It was worth the wait. It was worth the books in the middle of the series where the story slowed down and focused more on politics. It was even worth slogging through \"Crossroads of Twilight\" . I really just don't even know how to tell you how good this book was. If you've made it this far in the series, you will not be disappointed. It is one of the most satisfying endings to anything that I have ever had the pleasure to witness, and I thank God that I ever picked up the first book all those years ago for it. \"A Memory of Light\" . It's such a fitting title. Even more so considering the author's untimely demise. So long as there is light in the world, we, the fans, will never forget. James Oliver Rigney Jr.** sir, though you and I never met, I would like to think that we might have been friends if we had. Thank you, my friend, for everything. May the light shine forever upon you and yours. Though you are gone from this world, your memory remains, as does your legacy. May they never fade or falter. Goodbye. \"The wind blew southward, through knotted forests, over shimmering plains and toward lands unexplored. This wind, it was not the ending. There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was an ending.\" And I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried when I read that paragraph the first time. It was such a beautiful way of bringing things to an end. Most of my life I read about the winds that were beginnings, and now, this one, brought an end. Check out my other reviews. **Robert Jordan was the pen name used by James Oliver Rigney Jr. Also, some time ago, Brandon Sanderson ran a charity fundraiser. For a mere ten dollars, a person could have their name and general description entered into a drawing. These names would be pulled out whenever Sanderson needed to give a character a name. He would try to work in the person's description as much as possible, and change the person's name to fit within the world of \"The Wheel of Time\" . Much to my surprise and childlike glee, my name was drawn the very day that I entered it. In the chapter titled \"The Last Battle\" on page 626, a little more than halfway down, you will find a character named Allin being yelled at by Uno who shares my general description. That's where I was used. Amongst the best ten bucks that I've ever spent, I think. ...more I started reading this series when I was 11. Today, at 23, I managed to get a copy off my friend a day early. I got it just after work, and I've had a few hours to myself. It's midnight, and I haven't stopped reading. I'm sure I'll have to blog about the immensity of this series, and what it's meant to me, once I'm done, but for now, I just wanted to give a quick, spoiler-free update: this book is essentially a 900 page battle sequence involving dozens of characters, and spanning an entire world.

I have two main reactions to this (<---B>though I'm only halfway through</---B>). The first is courtesy of 11-year-old me reaching through time and space to say: HOLY SHIT, THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME. FUCK. YEAH. The second is the slightly more measured, 23-year-old student of writing, who is quite simply in awe of this staggering achievement, this colossal work of art, woven of so many delicate strands. The level of detail, the timing, the pacing, to bring it to this point...HOLY SHIT, THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME. Robert Jordan, you magnificent bastard, I love you. EDIT: I finished the book a few hours ago. I'm so very glad that I was able to use work as a means to extend the reading experience beyond one burned-out marathon. This way, over two and a half days, I was able to space it out and luxuriate in it. If ever there was a book to be savoured, it is this one. It was, for me, the greatest storytelling experience I've ever had, and likely will ever have. Three decades in the making, twelve years in the reading, such an astonishing journey. It defies belief. How, with such astronomical expectations, was it pulled off? I don't know. Likely, I never will, and I'm not sure I even want to - some mysteries are necessary. My reactions, in case you're wondering, are the same at the end as they were midway through. And okay, yes, there were some tears, it wasn't all manly exclamations but so what? Lastly, 'A Silence Like Screaming' remains my favourite chapter title ever. Wonderful, wonderful stuff. ...more Why I believe 2012 is actually the end... I'll apologize up front, this may be a little insensitive, but it's all in the name of entertainment so that makes everything okay. At least that's what the television show, Family Guy, tells me. You may have heard that according to the Mayans' (among others) long count calendar, 2012 is the end date - more specifically December 21, 2012. Many have interpreted this to mean that this is the end of the world that's been predicted. I never put much weight on Why I believe 2012 is actually the end...

Many have interpreted this to mean that this is the end of the world that's been predicted. I never put much weight on it until recently. You know what, I believe it all now. Here's why, and it has to do with The Wheel of Time. We've just been told that the release date has been set and that date is January 8, 2013. I don't think that's meant to happen. First, The Wheel of Time has been delayed over and over again. What was meant to be a three book series has turned into 14. A series that's been 23 years in the making. Then, and much to everyone's surprise and great sadness, Robert Jordan is diagnosed with a rare disease and dies in 2007. Another few years later, we see the series resurrected with Brandon Sanderson at the helm. Things are going well, and then the artist who's done every cover since the beginning of the series, Darrell K. Sweet, dies in 2011. The SFF community lost two of its greats and both connected to this series. An ending to The Wheel of Time is not meant to be. Do yourself a favor, don't even try to finish this series. No one's getting out of it alive. With the 2012 phenomenon and the tragic occurences that have marked this series, the coincidences are much too real. ...more \"Like the unfettered dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon Reborn confront the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall give us the Light. Let tears flow, O ye people of the world. Weep for your salvation!\" In the depths of the Blight, the armies of the Dark One are marshalling their power. In the Westlands, Rand al\u2019Thor and his allies are preparing for the coming storm.

The Last Battle looms above all, and the Dragon Reborn prepares to face the full strength of Shai\u2019tan and defeat the Shadow one last time\u2026 I must admit something that might come as a shock to most of you: When I finished A Memory of Light , it was probably my least favourite Wheel of Time book. And that is not simply because the series ends here, or because I was unhappy with how things turned out (though I was). It was for a variety of reasons. Now, I had written two long paragraphs where I heavily criticised the book for those reasons. Partly because I now disagree with myself, and partly because I choose to ignore the book\u2019s flaws, those paragraphs have now mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again. Suffice it to say that the book could have finished off in a better way, but that what we have is satisfying enough. And of course, this is Wheel of Time. I don\u2019t really care about what I didn\u2019t like. I want to talk about what I loved instead. So why was this a satisfying conclusion? There are seven reasons for that, four or which are scenes or details in the book. The fifth is the best title of any fantasy book ever. The sixth is the fact that this is a Wheel of Time book and despite some minor disappointment, this is the ending to my favourite fantasy series of all time. The seventh is the fact that this is another of those books that I just love more and more for each moment that passes after having finished it. As for those four scenes, one is Rand\u2019s gathering of all the factions and nations of the world early in the book, simply because of the arrival of one single very important character. The other three are in the epilogue. And the epilogue, the only chapter in the book to be written single-handedly by Robert Jordan, is the crowning glory of A Memory of Light and one of the best chapters in the whole series. It contains arguably the most emotional scene in the series. It contains an absodamnlutely perfect ending paragraph which makes you think \u201cBut of course it ends like that!\u201d And after said paragraph, it contains a repetition of my favourite non-Tolkien fantasy quote. I am eternally grateful to Jordan for using that quote to end the series, and I will also use it to end my last Wheel of Time review\u2026 And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died. And men cried out to the Creator, saying, O Light of the Heavens, Light of the World, let the Promised One be born of the mountain, according to the prophecies, as he was in ages past and will be in ages to come. Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs. Let the arm of the Lord of the Dawn shelter us from the Dark, and the great sword of justice defend us. Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time. ...more It is difficult to know what to say about this final Wheel of Time book. It really was one of the very best instalments of the whole series. The story was exciting and engaging from start to finish. A lot ton cool stuff happened and it was packed with a number of shocking and emotional moments. My overall opinion is that this was a good way to conclude the series. That said, I was not delighted by the way a small number of key story arcs were concluded and that has left me with a tiny feeling of It is difficult to know what to say about this final Wheel of Time book.

That said, I was not delighted by the way a small number of key story arcs were concluded and that has left me with a tiny feeling of dissatisfaction with the conclusion to the Wheel of Time series. All in all I do still think this series deserves to be considered as one of the true greats in the fantasy genre. Few series have the depth and level of world building of Jordan's fantastic and truly epic Wheel of Time. Jordan had a few flaws as an author but he created a vivid world that had plenty of depth and populated it with a ton of fascinating characters. He also had an engaging storytelling style. I thought Sanderson worked out perfect as a replacement for Jordan. He did a few things different but on the whole I think he kept the feel of WoT and I doubt anyone else could have finished the story so well. I'm actually a little sad that this is the last WoT book. The conclusion was final enough to work as a good ending but this world definitely had a lot more stories that were worth telling. I'd have loved for Sanderson to have written a few spin-off series set in this world! Rating: 5 stars! Despite a few issues with the conclusion I do still think this is a book well worth a 5 star rating. Audio Note: It goes without saying that Kramer and Reading gave flawless performances. ...more Well here we are and it is finally over.

This is one of the only books series I\u2019ve read where I\u2019ve spent 80% of the time in various states of dissatisfaction with most of the characters for some reason or another but still liked the overall story. One of my biggest pet peeves of the entire series was Rand and his Three loves (view spoiler) [I really hated that in the end I never felt like he loved any of them. Maybe Min\u2026.I think she is his soul mate but he didn\u2019t really spend much time with Avienda or Elayne and yet they are totally devoted and in love with him ugh\u2026. (hide spoiler) ] Min is awesome though and one of the few characters in the series I was never upset with. There is really no way that after a journey like this you won\u2019t have a plethora of feelings. If you are a huge fantasy reader then I think this is one of those series you have to tackle sometime in your life. There are a few slower books that ooze of worldbuilding, political maneuvering and characters but no serious plot movement and then there are the final 4 books of the series that are amazing and it feels like everything happened in. There are things I loved in this series and things I really hated but overall I enjoyed the journey I went on. Some people survived that I didn\u2019t think would. Some people died that I thought were safe and it was heartbreaking. But then there are those heroic moments that original cast from the Two Rivers Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene and Nynaeve got to have and each one shone bright at the end no matter how they were dragged into their destiny. Still it is the end and for some of the side characters I wanted a little more info, hell for some of the main characters I wanted to know more. It isn\u2019t perfect, there isn\u2019t an epilogue set 5 or 10 or 20 years later and I really wanted one. I was very interested in the directions that some of the people left were going to take. But in an epic this big I guess it is impossible to tie up every last thing so I\u2019ve filled in a few things for myself with some of the hopes and dreams I had for the remaining characters. My hat is off to Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for undertaking this massive fantasy series. It is an amazing journey that I might one day take again because the wheel weaves as the wheel wills and there is no beginning and there are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time.

I'm going to need a couple of days to sort myself out. 20 minutes later I'm still crying. I really wanted to give this book five stars, and if I had stopped reading about halfway through, I might have. As I went on, though, some little things that I had glossed over as I devoured the book started to weigh heavier and heavier on me, and in the end, I can't give it more than 2 stars.

On Taimandred Demandred: (view spoiler) [What a waste. Okay, yes, Shara was Chekov's Gun . I don't necessarily have a problem with them showing up to fight in the Last Battle, because we knew they were out there, but we had such sketchy knowledge of them that all the scenes with them feel like they happened BECAUSE PLOT rather than because of any buildup earlier in the series. I mean, Bao the Wyld? The prophecies? These are mentioned in the book, but since we had literally no hints about them previously they don't actually matter. Getting the Aiel to follow Rand took multiple books of set up and still ended up with some rough spots, but we're supposed to accept Demandred at the head of the Sharans fighting for the Shadow in the span of a few pages. Honestly, he could have shown up leading an army of cats from the moon and it would have had roughly the same effect. Well, maybe wolves from the moon. At least the fact that wolves can talk was previously established. Also, the racist overtones of having the mysterious and unknowable people from the east who have a massively hierarchical society, are totally untrustworthy, and are fanatically devoted to their leaders arriving in hordes to destroy all that is good are kind of right up there in your face. I know Tolkien did it too, but come on. The scene with Rand and Roedran of Murandy felt like it was only in there because that was one of the main theories of where Demandred was. He shows up, Rand stares at him all confused, and then he's never seen again. Finally, this was Demandred? The guy who said: He was a general, a great general, but generals did not have to fight alongside the men they commanded! in Winter's Heart ? The guy who said: \"So it seems he must be killed after all,\" Demandred said. Hiding his satisfaction was not easy. Rand al\u2019Thor or Lews Therin Telamon, he would rest easier when the fellow was dead. Does that sound like the revenge-obsessed homicidal maniac who's ready to throw the entire war just to kill Rand? Demandred's hate is mentioned previously, but it seems like it was the only part of his character that was actually kept. You could honestly replace Demandred with a giant robot who ran around broadcasting \"LEWS THE-RIN! LEWS THE-RIN!\" and blowing up the good guys with lasers at the head of his army of terminators and other than the WTF factor, you wouldn't have to change the structure of the story at all. Well, I guess a giant robot would have a hard time fighting three duels that were essentially the same duel. And Demandred saying Gawyn was worse than Galad even though Gawyn was enhanced by multiple bloodknife rings? That's just cold. Getting taken out by Lan wasn't bad, other than the repetitiousness of the dueling, but setting it up to look like Lan died and then having him suddenly be alive was a cop out. Lan was the one who told Rand about Sheathing the Sword. Lan has spent the entire series expecting to die. Then again, after Galad \"clearly\" got his head cut off and then suddenly lived because plot, I guess I shouldn't have expected anything else. Finally, here's what should have happened. Demandred thought Mat was Rand in disguise. He should have fought Gawyn, and maybe Galad, and then come after Mat personally and demanded a duel, while mocking Mat for using his ashandarei . And then: \u201cWho was the greatest blademaster of all time?\u2019 From the throats of dozens of students came a massed bellow. \u201cJearom, Gaidin!\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d Hammar shouted, turning to make sure all heard. \u201cDuring his lifetime, Jearom fought over ten thousand times, in battle and single combat. He was defeated once. By a farmer with a quarterstaff! Remember that. Remember what you just saw.\u201d - The Dragon Reborn And that's how Demandred should have died. Also, I still maintained that Taim was Demandred, Jordan changed it when people guessed, and that's why Taim has essentially nothing to do in the Last Battle. (hide spoiler) ] On the other hand, the scenes with Shendla were actually kind of bittersweet--a taste of what might have happened if Demandred hadn't let his envy consume him. Those were very brief, but well done. On the battle in the Bore: (view spoiler) [The Dark One won. \"What?\" you're saying, \"No he didn't. He didn't destroy the world!\" Yes, but the Light had the possibility for total victory . They could have destroyed the Dark One, preventing the cycle from repeating itself, preventing potentially billions of needless deaths and the literal destruction of the world or end of all hope for everyone forever, and Rand didn't do it because the Dark One tricked him. Rand's vision of a world without the Dark One is shown as flawed, because the people there lack free will. Without the Dark One providing the possibility of choice, we are told, there is no ability for humans to make meaningful choices, thus making them essentially robots without any real understanding of good or evil. Except this is incredibly stupid because Shadar Logoth exists . Way back in The Eye of the World , we're shown an example of human evil. Shadow Logoth is specifically called out as an example of how bad humans can be to each other even in the absence of the Dark One. They hated the Shadow so much that they were willing to do anything to defeat it, and it eventually caused their ruin. Even if you ignore Shadar Logoth, Verin mentions the Whitecloaks as an example of terrible people: The Children are very nearly as vile as men can be, short of Darkfriends, but they are not Darkfriends. - The Shadow Rising So it's clearly established that the Dark One is not the source of all evil like Rand seems to think he is. Furthermore, the balance between good and evil is an inherently facile concept. Law and chaos in conflict at least makes sense, because you can conceive of too much law (unending stasis where nothing changes or grows) and too much chaos (eternal flux where nothing is certain), but what does too much good even mean ? It reminds me of the Dragonlance backstory, where they show the Kingpriest of Istar as an example of the dangers of too much \"good\" because of his actions. Except if you told any random person that the ruler of a country was having his officials randomly read people's minds and execute them for crimes they hadn't committed yet, I'm pretty sure that they wouldn't call that good. Just the opposite, I expect. In The Wheel of Time , the Dark One is consistently depicted as a force of supernatural evil. I'm using supernatural here in the literal sense of \"outside the natural order.\" Even in the Age of Legends, there were still criminals. Even in the Age of Legends, there was still strife. Hell, Rand specifically says that the paradise probably would have ended in war eventually because people are people and you can't really change that. Making the Dark One the source of all evil doesn't just contradict what has gone before, it means the characters in the series aren't actually humans. They're meat puppets who only behave as though they had a real choice because of the supernatural influence of a literal evil deity. And the Dark One doesn't offer a choice anyway! The only way we've ever seen a darkfriend redeemed is through death, and that almost never happens. Otherwise, all the other darkfriends keep mentioning that they want to get out, but they can't because the Dark One is too strong, or too insistent, or can find them anywhere, or whatever. Basically, it's free will but with an inevitable downward tilt. And admittedly, that does fit what I wrote about in my Towers of Midnight review about how the world is inevitably doomed, but it hardly fits the definition of free will if the choice only goes one way. Speaking of that inevitability, it means that not only has Rand doomed the world, he's doomed everyone he knows to eventual horrific eternal suffering in hell, given sufficient passing of time. Nice job, \"savior\"! And ignoring all that, you're trying to tell me that in a series that has been about the inexorable march of destiny from day 1, a series that has the Prophecies of the Dragon, the Foretelling, forcibly Turning channelers to the Shadow, and Min Farshaw, a series where one of the most well-known sayings among fans is \"The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills\"...the real conflict is about free will !? It's just bad. That's the bottom line. On the other hand, the actual sealing of the Bore was good. Callandor's flaw, the women at Shayol Ghul, the Dragon needing Callandor even though the Choedan Kal exists...all of that had plenty of setup over the course of multiple books and was very well executed. Ignoring all the context, the end of the Last Battle was good. (hide spoiler) ] On Padan Fain: (view spoiler) [That's it? After all those books of buildup, he just goes down like a chump at the end without really doing anything? On the other hand, this is The Wheel of Time . He's not even in the top ten of characters who get built up only to go down like a chump. To Padan Fain! He died as he lived! Like a chump. (hide spoiler) ] On Mat: (view spoiler) [The scene with Rand and Mat trying to one-up each other really crystallized for me how much Sanderson doesn't get Mat. Here's the thing. He writes Mat like Mat's part of a comedy team. Like Mat's the prankster, or the funny man. That's different than Jordan's Mat. Jordan's Mat is part of a comedy team, but he's not the funny man, he's the straight man. The Pattern itself is the funny man. (hide spoiler) ] On the usage of the One Power: (view spoiler) [All the new applications for gateways were obviously Sanderson's influence. He's pretty well known--and with good reason--for meticulously thinking through the capabilities and limitations of the magic systems he designs for his own books, so all the different things that the channelers do with gateways do make sense, but it doesn't seem like the kind of thing Jordan would have written. Nonetheless, as a tabletop gamer, I appreciated that the characters actually did the kinds of things I'd always wondered why they never did. On the other hand, it never really felt like there were a lot of channelers around. There should have been hundreds of Aes Sedai, thousands of Wise Ones, hundreds of Windfinders, damane , the several dozen non-evil Asha'man, etc., vs. hundreds of Dreadlords and Ayyad, but the impression I got was there were a few dozen people on each side. I get that Sanderson wanted to maintain the impression that the Light was in huge trouble without wanting to overwhelm them, but it went a bit far. Also, Demandred didn't do all that much for having a stupid-powerful sa'angreal and being linked in a full circle. Sure, he was killing tons of regular troops, but so did the random Black Ajah sisters who kidnapped Elayne, and there were...what, seven of them? Androl (Sanderon's pet character) was far more clever with the \"gateway into Dragonmount\" trick than Demandred was with his laser blasts. Based on what we saw just Rand do with Callandor against the Shadow in the Stone of Tear, or against the Seanchan in Altara, Demandred should have been able to wave a hand and blow up the entire army of the Light. Of course, that would have ended the book right there, so instead Demandred gets an Idiot Ball so big he has to carry it around on his back like Atlas. (hide spoiler) ] A Memory of Light was definitely a page-turner, but it still felt like a lot of it was just padding. The Last Battle chapter is 175 pages long and bounces repeatedly along multiple viewpoints, but that and a lot of the previous chapters kind of come down to: trollocs attack, good guys defend, something unexpected and usually bad happens, good guys are set back and must regroup, repeat for 600 pages. A lot of the page-turning devolves to trying to get to the next section where something happens to the characters you care about but not moving too fast to accidentally skip a pivotal event. I think the book was maybe a third too long, but at this point books that are too long as kind of a tradition with The Wheel of Time , so while I didn't like it, at least I was used to it. So after all that, what did I like? Well, Graendal's plot against the Light was very good and was foreshadowed multiple books ago. Perrin's tasks in the wolf dream were neat, and there were a few short scenes that I thought were far, far better than most of the surrounding material: Thom guarding the way into Shayol Ghul or the gateway to Hinderstap, for example. As an aside, what do trollocs eat? (Yeah, I know, \"people.\" ha ha) I mean, there are millions of them showing up everywhere, they haven't been raiding out of the Borderlands for about nine months prior to the Last Battle, and they seem to be primarily carnivorous, so I doubt anyone is growing crops for them in the Blight even if we didn't know that a lot of the life in the Blight will kill trollocs just as readily as it will anyone else. This is always a problem in fantasy stories with a generically evil monstrous race, because they need to live in marginal land that no one else wants while simultaneously being enough of a threat from numbers to overwhelm the good guys, but there were so many of them here that it bothered me more than it usually does. In the end, A Memory of Light is like an elaborate house of cards. It looks incredibly intricate and beautiful from a distance, but once I stepped in to take a closer look, it all fell apart. It is not the ending, for there are no endings to the turnings of the Wheel of Time, but it is an ending, and honestly I think the series might have been better off without it. Edit : Having finally read \"River of Souls,\" I can now comment on that too. And mostly of what I can say is that I'm glad it was left out. Not because it was bad, because it wasn't, but because it would have made the out-of-nowhere problems of Shara much, much bigger. \"River of Souls\" hints at probably an entire trilogy's worth of material that Demandred was getting up to in Shara while the other events were going on, and in a series that's so based on foreshadowing and hints being dropped that are picked up ten books later, \"River of Souls\" is about how a kinds of things happened that the reader had no idea about and will never get to hear. Explaining Bao the Wyld is all well and good, but not when it opens up so many other questions. I'm glad I read it now, disconnected from my read-through of the series, because if anything it would have made me like the Sharan plotline even less than I ended up doing. Also, I'm still unable to avoid a smirk whenever I read the word Bao .

While I was reading A Memory of Light I felt I really didn't want this series to end. I felt like they should or could continue on. I mean there are some many things they could write about all of this. As I reached the end of the book, something inside of me changed and all I have to say is WOW!!! This was a perfect ending to a perfect and well written series. It ended with so much feeling and emotion. Rand Al'Thore you are the best!!!!!!!!! Egwene I love you Wow.... I knew that you were strong but Wow I hadn't envisioned it to be like that!!!! Mat Cauthon.... I Have to say you were just awesome in the Last Battle really and truley Awesome!!!! Perrin, Perrin, Perrin... for me you have been my least favourite charachter during this whole series, but let me tell you that you are no longer..... you killed it this time and I am truley in awe of you. To all the rest you all had amazing roles such as the Aiel, Aes Sedai, the band, the dragonsworn.... Wow!!! The battles were awesome.... Oh I must not forget Logain, he came a long way during the series and at the end my heart felt for him. I loved seeing all the people giving him thanks for what he did. Androl Kicked ass big time and I loved the determination he had. Where was he during the whole series. Lan you were totally awesome as well and when you took care of buisness (people who read the book with understand) that was just amazing you are badass!!! Thank you so much Robert Jordan for writting this series it has been a beacon of light in my life and thank you Brandon Sanderson for contiuing this series in and exceptional way. ...more I\u2019d like to start off this review by saying that my one star-ing of this book is NOT simply a bashing on Sanderson. I have many problems with this book and they fall at the feet of both Sanderson and Jordan. I have been an avid reader of the Wheel of Time novels for the last decade--as a thirteen year old I fell in love with the books. At the time Jordan was still writing what would be his last books, and I reveled in them. I am by no means an avid defender of Jordan\u2019s writing, particularly his I\u2019d like to start off this review by saying that my one star-ing of this book is NOT simply a bashing on Sanderson. I have many problems with this book and they fall at the feet of both Sanderson and Jordan. I have been an avid reader of the Wheel of Time novels for the last decade--as a thirteen year old I fell in love with the books. At the time Jordan was still writing what would be his last books, and I reveled in them. I am by no means an avid defender of Jordan\u2019s writing, particularly his abysmal approach to romance, but I still count The Wheel of Time novels among my favorite books. Of course, his death was crushing and I knew it would be the end of the \u201ctypical WoT book.\u201d I was pleasantly surprised with Sanderson\u2019s first two books\u2014even with the ABSOLUTE murder of Mat\u2019s character\u2014and I was incredibly eager to read the final chapter. Unfortunately for me, it was an incredible let down. In order to limit myself and not go on a ten page rant on everything I could say about this book, I\u2019ve condensed issues into four categories that I think are most detrimental to the book. One: Characters barely stay true to what they\u2019ve been built up over fourteen books to be. My fellow reviewer Mel says it best: \u201cEvery character speaks with the same voice. If you removed the names, I think it would be almost impossible to determine who might be speaking.\u201d The characters feel more like chess pieces to move the plot than characters with different motives. The most glaring example of this is in a certain warrior who has gone through significant character development in recent books: deciding that he is not a man alone, a lone warrior on the field, but is actually a man, a husband and his life matters and is more than just a weapon against shadow. He makes the choice to be a leader instead of the point guard. Then he makes a choice that is completely contrary to everything his previous development pointed to, it's the stupidest decision in WoT history--even more stupid than the many stupid decisions of one sun-haired princess, which is saying something. This just screams \"I NEEDED HIM FOR PLOT.\" This is basically my second point\u2026 Two: Secondary characters are tossed around like rag-dolls. This one I am laying at the feet of Sanderson. The WoT books are absolutely teeming with secondary characters, and they are one of my favorite parts of Jordan\u2019s writing. Even if a character wasn\u2019t one of the thirteen or so big players, they still were treated like they mattered. Secondary characters in AMOL are nothing. Some important (Elaida) and some less important (Lini, Thera) characters are not even seen in this book. Many that appear are mentioned in passing, the reader not knowing their final fate. Scores of secondary characters die, which is not unreasonable in itself, but their deaths are often just footnotes\u2014only noteworthy for how it may impact the plans of the Primary. I\u2019d say this is the biggest difference between Jordan and Sanderson: Jordan treated secondary characters like full, realized characters who happen to be in the background of the story he is telling. Sanderson treated secondary characters like devices he can pull out and throw away when he needs some plot filler or some sad moment to take up space. Three: The incredible lack of emotional involvement or response. The book reads as if most characters have the emotional range of toddlers. The return of perhaps the most pivotal character in the series is met with all of the circumstance of a long wait in a dentist\u2019s lobby. This character has significant and unresolved relationships with every single primary character, and their re-entry onto the stage is not an emotional gorefest as it should be, but is--quite literally--a small expression of shock, a hug and a handshake. As disappointed as I was with this scene, the overall theme of \u201cEvents Have No Emotional Consequence\u201d is continued throughout the book. As I\u2019ve already hinted, and as you might expect, the last book of a sweeping epic about the struggle between good and evil contains a fairly large amount of character deaths. However, even significant character deaths seem to be gotten over in seconds by the survivors. One can easily argue that it is war--the aptly named Last Battle--and there is no room for the survivors to grieve, but I am just not buying it. One character looses what amounts to their entire family and the totality of writing devoted to the reactions to those deaths can be counted in sentences\u2014not paragraphs. Even AFTER the battle is over, there is a scant few sentences concerning the consequences of death. This brings me to my last point. Four: Absolutely no closure. In my opinion, it is simply criminal to end a fifteen volume epic with: The Big Bad was dealt with. The end. What the hell happens to these characters that I have grown up with? What are the goddamn consequences of this war? Do the survivors have long and happy lives? Do they have kids? Do they pine over their lost friends? I didn\u2019t sink ten years of my life into these people to be told: \u201cYeah, they live. Bye.\u201d It may be that I was spoiled by Tolkien, because he respected his characters enough to give them endings. Not knowing what happens to all of these characters is such an enormous disappointment, and I am more saddened by that than anything that happened in AMOL. I\u2019ll end with one last analogy. My most important critique of AMOL is that it is too much of a catalog. If you read a history of the most important events of WWII and then read Elie Wiesel\u2019s Night , it would be clear that the first was a book of momentous events, but the second was a book of immensity. AMOL is far too much of the former and far, far too little of the latter. And as someone who fell in love with all of the characters of WoT, I feel like I deserved more from their final story. And much more importantly they--as men and women, as kings and queens, as warriors and witches, as blacksmiths and barmaids, as gamblers and scholars, as healers and handmaidens, as shepherds and innkeeper\u2019s daughters\u2014-they deserved better. ...more Rating: 6/10 A Memory of Light is quite a good read and leaves me reasonably satisfied at the conclusion of an epic 14-book fantasy series that I have been reading for nearly 20 years. I know that \"quite a good read\" and \"reasonably satisfied\" sound like damning with faint praise, so let me clarify that I think Brandon Sanderson has done an amazing job with his contributions to the Wheel of Time series - it was a huge ask to pull that entire thing together even in 3 books and he's done a super job Rating: 6/10 A Memory of Light is quite a good read and leaves me reasonably satisfied at the conclusion of an epic 14-book fantasy series that I have been reading for nearly 20 years. I know that \"quite a good read\" and \"reasonably satisfied\" sound like damning with faint praise, so let me clarify that I think Brandon Sanderson has done an amazing job with his contributions to the Wheel of Time series - it was a huge ask to pull that entire thing together even in 3 books and he's done a super job for the fans. Robert Jordan created an awe-inspiring world in writing Wheel of Time, and he also left a massive amount of plot lines to be resolved in the final books. Added to that he even wrote the entire epilogue of A Memory of Light ~7 years ago. With these restrictions and limitations for Sanderson to deal with, it's astonishing how well he did with the last three books. Even if Jordan could have finished it himself, with such a huge and complex series many readers did expect unanswered questions and I accepted that before reading. So why the faint praise? Here are some things that I take issue with in A Memory of Light. I thought that Mat would have more surprises to bring to bear in the battle, particularly towards the end - I was hoping for yet another trick up the sleeve that didn't turn up. Mat didn't seem to have quite the same level of strategy and battle knowledge he showed in other books - although, quite annoyingly, his fellow characters seemed to mention his tactical brilliance with every second breath. I wasn't mad about the Compulsion used on the great generals - surely they would be protected given that Tel'aran'rhiod is busier than a train station these days, and that we know about dream protection since Moiraine mentioned it all the way back when we started in book #1. It sounds like they had a lot of folks calling in sick when it actually came to Tarmon Gai'don. Where were the 2000-4000 Aiel channellers, the 1000+ Aes Sedai, the 1000+ Kin, and the thousands of Wind Finders? I expected massive circles of channellers wielding sa'angreal capable of killing the anticipated millions of Trollocs. Two hundred or more Black Ajah and a thousand Asha'man, many turned. The impression I got was of 20-30 Aes Sedai facing the enemy alongside Egwene. The location of thousands, if not tens of thousands of channellers is not something that we should be wondering about. What about the Green - the \"Battle Ajah\"? They escape mention at the Fields of Merrilor - were they off drinking tea and discussing braid tugging techniques because someone forgot to invite them to the Last Battle? I don't think so. We had loads of awesome uses of the power in Dumai's Wells - dome, exploding ground, headsplosions, etc - and at the manor house - death gates and all that. Where were these in the Last Battle? We know that only a 'remnant of a remnant' of the Aiel will survive, surely that means that several hundred thousand of them die in the Last Battle. Yet we get the impression of hundreds, perhaps in the low thousands, of Aiel moving around and fighting during the battle. Do they even get orders from Mat? I don't think so - please correct me if I'm missing something. Aside: I didn't like how the Aviendha's visions of the Aiel future seemed to be just written off. It felt like an editorial decision where either resolving this storyline would take too many pages -and requiring another book - or simply that the writing team felt that the deus ex machina resolution would satisfy readers. Logain, Morgase and Padan Fain were massively built up in early books as important characters with important roles. Logain was utterly disappointing to the point of arguably proving Min's visions incorrect - which they should never be. The Morgase and Fain cameos were slightly better in that the didn't deserve more than a couple of lines. Many other cameo appearances felt like just that - name drops rather than real important roles. Surely we could have got some preview of Shara's importance and role, rather than simply dropping them in for what seems like plot convenience. Jain Farstrider or Forsaken scenes could have given some more hints in earlier books. Speaking of plot convenience, the \"plot armor\" was particularly strong for major characters in the Last Battle - far more of them should have died. For the sake of anyone reading this accidentally, I won't mention names, but I felt they got off particularly lightly. And as for poor Bela - cruel, guys, cruel! We now know how Rand survives, taking over another body. This was a decision made by Jordan years ago but despite the hints that the two were connected, it does seem just a little bit too easy. I agree with those who compare it to a Gemmell-style rushed ending - the battle is still going and you're wondering how the book could possible end in a couple more pages. I think Jordan's prescribed epilogue is a strong factor in this - if Sanderson had some leeway to add to the epilogue I think that would have significantly helped. A note on the ebook: publication of the ebook version of A Memory of Light was deliberately delayed 4 months by Robert Jordan's wife, Harriet because she was concerned that the hardcover may not reach the top of the bestseller lists if purchases were divided between e-book and hardcover. She felt that this would harm her husband's legacy. I think that's a bloody stupid decision. In attempting to protect the legacy, this decision has actually harmed Jordan's legacy by preventing many loyal fans from getting a copy of the book in the format they want. What's happened now is that hundreds of readers have protested the decision by giving the book 1-star Amazon reviews - there are currently over 300 1-star reviews on Amazon.com. Some may argue that it is wrong to post a 1-star review on the book because the review is not for the correct version (you cannot review the ebook as it hasn't been released) or that a review is not the correct way to express anger and disappointment with the publishers (and Harriet), and that the complainants should write strongly worded letters to the publisher instead. My view on this is that the decision was taken to arbitrarily delay publishing the ebook in order to manipulate sales figures of the hardcover, and therefore having people express anger with this decision through online reviews is absolutely fair game. Those reviews will send the publishers a clear message about introducing arbitrary delays in the future. Overall, I felt A Memory of Light was pretty good. It didn't ruin the series, which is a real danger with final books, but it could have been significantly better too. There are points I've noted above that seem like lack of attention to detail, which was always one of Jordan's strongest points. I'd have to conclude that they were missed by the writing & review team, or worse, noted and ignored. Those details are important in any story, but in this more than most given Jordan's incredible attention to detail and encyclopaedic knowledge and information management. The mistakes remind me of the 2012 movie Prometheus which had massive potential, but was very much let down by plot holes and inconsistencies . But in reviewing this book, I need to also look at where it came from, that it is the conclusion of an epic 14 book, 4 million word story, and that the author had 3rd party limitations and deadlines for an already difficult task. That gives it serious positive points in my count, enough to outweigh many of the negatives I've outlined above. In conclusion, I give A Memory of Light between a 6/10 or a 7/10 overall - the ebook fiasco tilts me clearly toward the 6.

I used to complain about the way Brandon Sanderson handled the series in the previous two books, but this time I really do not have anything to complain about. I can see several reasons for this. It might be that Robert Jordan left the most detailed notes related to the conclusion - after all, the epilog was written entirely by him. It also probably that Brandon Sanderson finally became comfortable writing the series. The last factor I can think of: the weakest part of Sanderson's writing were the characters; in case of this book there is no character development - thirteen previous books should be enough for this, but there is a lot of action: something Sanderson is very good at writing. I suspect all of the above is true. I mentioned action. The whole book is a prelude to The Last Battle and the Battle itself. The best word to describe the latter would be \"epic\". In terms of epicness it beats the crap out of everything I read, which made me wish to see how Robert Jordan would handle this as big battles was one of his strengths (Dumai's Wells come to mind). The actual military action for this single one takes up around one fourth of the whole book which makes around 200 pages. You can really feel this is the last battle: both sides do not hold back and there is no retreat as the whole world is at stake. Major people die on both sides, including quite a few I did not expect. I also think I need to clarify something. I criticized Brandon Sanderson a lot for his handling of the series. I need to express my gratitude to him for finishing it. He mentioned that his major task was to show how the series would end and he succeed admirably at this. As a conclusion: is the series worth the read? Yes, very much so. I do not have a single sliver of regret for having done this. I feel like something is missing from my life, something which was with me since the year 1993. I also feel like seeing off my dear friends forever: they are all good people with their uniqueness and annoyances.

Having grown up with these characters, spending hundreds of hours investing myself within their storylines, watching them transcend from naive village youths into the 'movers and shakers' of a richly detailed and fully conceived world, to finally see their destined paths collide among the chaos and bloodshed of Tarmon Gai'don was breathtaking, heartbreaking, gratifying.

This was a somber journey, as I knew with every passing page that I was finishing a 23-year adventure unlike any other. Many will speak of the differences of style between Jordan and Sanderson, and even though the narrative inconsistencies in diction are more prevalent in areas than others, I still found myself amazed that Sanderson was able to take thousands of pages of material, with over dozens of distinct characters and plotlines, and masterfully bring to close Jordan's legendary tale while maintaining an overall sense of familiarity. That there is some ambiguity in the final chapters is fitting, I find on reflection, because life itself rarely finds closure in all concerns. ++Spoilers++ \"A Memory of Light\" is an exhausting read, not so much due to length, which is considerable nonetheless (weighing in at over 900 pages, it's a massive tome), but because you are witnessing multiple battlefronts towards the beginning of the story, which later converge into the Last Battle; Sanderson relishes writing these scenes, and is quite adept with his descriptions of what is happening, allowing you to easily visualize the larger context. PoVs change consistently, and this transforms the war into many 'snapshots', speeding along the narrative. The overall effect is well done. The many ways Sanderson plays with the concepts of gateways was one of my favorite aspects of this novel. Implementing them as viewpoints above battlefields from which you can gaze down through to witness the movements of troops, using them to create a lava funnel of death, or simply to brew tea was exciting to read about. Sanderson doesn't change the core mechanics of Jordan's magic system but expounds upon it in interesting ways. Creating a weave the opposite of Balefire, using Mask of Mirrors to lure enemies into elaborate traps, or using the regenerating villagers of a small town to 'return from the dead' at a critical point during a major campaign - these elements, along with many others, give fresh perspectives to Jordan's world. Prophecies that fans have been waiting to see fulfilled finally come to light, and in ways you least expect. Logain's glory, in particular. This isn't to say that I found everything perfect, to my tastes. I felt Fain/Mordeth's storyline was too inconsequential for all its buildup over multiple entries to the series. I'm not particularly a fan of Fain/Mordeth, but it felt rushed. However, it's a small qualm, and didn't truly detract from my reading experience. Bittersweet was the way I felt as I finished the last chapter. For all the braid-tugs, sniffs, arm-under-breasts and many other quirks of Jordan's prose, the Wheel of Time has been a major influence on my life and a story which has stood apart from the usual fantasy fare. Even though the industry is moving into 'darker, deeper, more complex and thoughtful' fantasy, where the lines are blurred, there are no young farmboys who become heroes nor dark lords seeking utter destruction, sometimes you want the archetypes. And the Wheel of Time is the epitome of High Fantasy. And \"A Memory of Light\" its swan song. ...more * Initial Thoughts * This book...

I think I need to sleep a bit on my thoughts and what I want to write as my full and final review so I'll probably come back to this tomorrow and add my actual 'review' but my Initial Thoughts are that it was a fairly perfect ending of course :) * Actual Review * Okay so I've now had a few days to process all of the thoughts I had surrounding this book and I have decided that this is certainly my favourite book from the whole Wheel of Time series. I think everything that Jordan ever envisioned and set up gets fully resolved and confronted within this 1,000+pg monster, and even though it's a long book everything works and feels balanced. This whole book is 'The Last Battle' which is something we've been working ou way towards for many of the previous books. Whilst the last two Sanderson books I gave 5*s to this is most definitely some very fine work on his part in oder to systematically address any and everything whilst also keeping the reader engaged and entertained throughout. There was honestly not a dull moment in this book or a section where I felt it needed to be cut down, everything was exciting. Of course we focus on many of our major characters throughout this book and we see not only the return of some characters we've not seen for a while, but also introductions of many new threats and coordinated attacks which our major characters and their followers need to face. I found the whole of the 'Last Battle' chapter (chap 37 which is over 200pgs long) to be highly intense and, considering it's SUCH an epic long battle fought on so many fronts, entirely readable! This is certainly something for Sanderson to be proud of because I'm often resistant to read battle heavy books and yet he managed to keep me hooked into the action throughout. Of course where there is battle there must be sacrifice and sadness and this book addressed both of those things very well by showing many of the main characters in tricky situations both physically and emotionally and even magically. I found myself totally absorbed in what was happening to who and who's plan was what and everything connected so well together that it all worked. The monsters and bad guys of the story definitely didn't shy away from making an appearance in this book and we had some pretty scary close calls and some tragic moments which I won't soon forget. As a lovely balance to this we also had some very whimsical, magical and touching moments which will equally hold a place in my heart for a long time. I have to say that if you have made it to the final book in this great series and you've been enjoying them as you go then this one is one to just sit back and enjoy. It's got something of everything I have enjoyed about the series and there's never a moment where I was bored. I read over 600 pages of this book in one day and spent a solid amount of time just being hooked into the story so it's one I can say with certainty deserves a 5*s from me. Bloody brilliant, well done to Sanderson and Jordan for planning such an epic finale! ...more \"I did not come here to win,\" Lan whispered, smiling. \"I came here to kill you.

A lot of astonishing twists were in the ga \"I did not come here to win,\" Lan whispered, smiling. \"I came here to kill you. Death is lighter than a feather.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyspI... This is what I kept listening on repeat through the chapter \"The Last Battle\". I was blown away by the whole book. It was more brutal and heartbreaking than I have expected. I honestly didn't think that Jordan will have the guts to kill so many important characters. Two deaths especially crushed me. A lot of astonishing twists were in the game and some of them were even fatal. I thought Tarmon Gai'don will last like 30 pages, but nope, it lasted the entire book. The ending wasn't what I thought it'd be, but I liked it anyway. All major questions are answered, all story lines got its conclusions. It may not be the conclusion you'd want since the climax was left quite open - instead of an end, we got a new beginning. I think Jordan wanted readers to imagine on their own how the life goes on after the Last Battle. The Last Battle was fought on four fronts: Shayol Ghul, Tarwin's Gap, Caemlyn and Kandor with four generals as their leaders: Rodel Ituralde, Gareth Bryne, Agelmar Jagad and Davram Bashere. After a while, Mat Cauthon takes matters into his own hands and starts calling the shots as he moved the battles to only one front - Fields of Merrilor. On the other side, Demandred commands the military of the Shadow. We finally find out where he has been hiding all along and it's without a doubt the best twist in the whole series. There was a lot of sass, actual exchange of affection between all main characters, which is something we never had. Aes Sedai were fighting side by side with Asha'mans and Seanchans. It's not about whether you like some characters more than others, it's all about how brave and strong they were, and willing to fight for their cause. <---C>Rand al'Thor</---C>, Dragon Reborn, farm boy who became king and a tragic hero. Powerful messiah with moral ambiguity which almost made him dark. A hero who couldn't let others be heroes because of his guilty conscience. A fragile soul who thought he could hold anxiety of the whole world on his shoulders. A stubborn man with trust issues. Chronically tired and obsolete of his destiny, he never stopped fighting even when he didn't know what he was fighting for. I hope there is a place where he finds happiness and peace, because he truly deserves it. His confrontation with the Dark One showed that he's a bigger man than Lews Therin ever was. Mat Cauthon, better known as light of my life, was cheeky and charismatic fox who became the biggest general since the Age of Legends. He was rude, didn't respect any authority and kept on \"trying\" to run away from responsibilities. His \"attempts\" to run away were always just a big talk. He was never there when you were looking for him, but he'd always appear just in time when you needed him the most. If he didn't do his part of the job, Rand's efforts in Shayol Ghul would've been meaningless. My favourite character in the series, maybe my favourite character ever. Perrin Aybara, I grew to like him only after the 13th book. Arguably, he was the best leader among all three Ta'verens. Honourable, careful, direct and durable - he deserved better story lines. Sadly, he was always holding onto his wife's skirt. He had the most important character development, among all main characters, because he finally learned on his mistakes. He accepted his inner wolf and obligation to be by Rand's side despite what Faile thinks of it. He defeated one Forsaken even Rand couldn't take down. Egwene al'Vere, queen of my heart, my favorite female character, brave lioness with iron spine, righteous leader. From the book 1 she had been falling into her own trap of seeing only what she wanted to see. Only in the last three books she seemed to adjust a bit. Her character development was extraordinary and probably the most compelling among all main characters. She became the most powerful women in the world and still she never thought of abusing her power. Her sacrifice helped Mat restore balance of the battle. Nynaeve al'Meara, the worst Aes Sedai in the world which made her the best Aes Sedai possible, even better than Egwene. She didn't know how to handle her anger, she never let other Aes Sedai change who she really was. She's bold, chatty, apprehensive, caring and got quite annoying with her \"know-it-all\" attitude, just like all females in the series. She never doubted Rand's decisions when everyone else did and in a way she was the only one besides Min who saved his soul. Elayne Trakand, assumptive blondie who couldn't accept any other's opinion but her own. I never understood Jordan fascination with her. Yes, she was a wise and principled queen, but all that she's done, it would've been equally effective with her being in the background. I may be a little subjective when it comes to her because I disliked her since the beginning and she gave me no reason to change my mind. She's strenuous, obnoxious and vexatious. Nonetheless, it is true that she was the heart of the Last Battle. Gavin Trakand, stupid little boy who I can't but sympathize with despite of all dumb decisions he's made through entire series. He was my favorite male after Mat and Rand, and it was so hard to love him since he made one fatal mistake after another. He always had his inner moral demons and they always got the best of him and when it was important the most I thought he'd finally change, at least for Egwene, but it didn't happen. He couldn't accept he's not the hero of the story, that he's job was to stay in the shadow of his sister and love of his life, even though he was raised to do that. He had one job in the Last Battle and he didn't fullfil it. Galad Damodred, the guy who saw the world in black and white and always insensibly told the truth. He surprised me the most because I didn't care for his well-being until he got his own POV. Feminists today would adore him, lol. Most of the time he seemed flat and shallow and I still can't decide whether it's true or not. He gave a new life to White Cloaks and never let his vanity take the best of him, but he also never acted on a genuine emotion. I don't know, even his affection for Berelain looked superficial. Siuan Sanche, not a very good Amirlin, but perfect counselor for the new one. She was penetrating, durable and stiff, but annoying as hell in many occasions, which was repetitive characteristic OF ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS. Jordan never did well his homework in studying how women function. Gareth Bryne, trustworthy general, who comprehended promises as more important than air or water. He never let his anger, queens nor any powerful women define him. He did well in Tarmon Gai'don as much as he could. Still, I was never particularly consumed by him. Androl, Asha'man who wasn't very strong with the One Power, but could teach Aes Sedai how to lead. Even when he saw no way out he kept on fighting. He saved the Black Tower with pure strength of his will and incredible leadership. al'Lan Mandragoran, Dai Shan, king of fallen country who irritatingly kept on wanting to die and doesn't let anyone save him. Stubborn, cold and emotional wreck, our dark knight. As he said himself, Rand and Nynaeve brought him back to life. Pevara Tazanovni broke all prejudices about Red Adjah and probably even Aes Sedai in general. She showed everything other Aes Sedai wanted to stay hidden - compassion, laughter, spark in eyes, temper, sense of humour. I'd give her Amirlin Seat. She was part of the union between Asha'mans and Aes Sedai. Tuon is a perplexed one. I had mixed feelings towards her. Basically, I hated everything Seanchan represents, but she confused me because she really wanted to bring justice. Well, justice as she saw it. She could take care of herself and she was a witty one, but she could be so short-minded. Min Farshaw served no purpose other than being a love interest for Rand. That's all she ever was. Her existence finally stopped being pointless only through the second half of this book. Yes, she kept Rand partially sane when he went dark, but I wanted to see who she really was WITHOUT HIM. Aviendha was interesting in the start, but she had fallen to monotony of Jordan's vision of how females behave. She was brave in the Last Battle, her showdown with particular Forsaken was quite impressive. She was still better than other Wise Ones. Faile Bashere was never one of my favorites. Truth be told I disliked her, just like Elayne, from the start. She was too obstinate and full of secrets. I also didn't like how she tried to keep Perrin away from Rand and Mat as much as possible. She couldn't accept that Perrin might care for SOMEONE ELSE WHO ISN'T HER. Moiraine Damodred, a women without whom Dragon Reborn would be lost. Her ability to see into one's soul was sometimes excruciating and her secrets were annoying, but she was one of the few who cared deeply for Rand in spite of who he was. Even Egwene in latter books saw him rather as Dragon Reborn, but Moiraine never made that mistake. Talmanes Delovinde finally got his own POV and it was really intense. He was so persistent and brave. He and Thom are the biggest trolls in the series, but not even Thom could make jokes on worst occasions like Talmanes. I laughed my ass of every time he teased Mat. Olver is a part of the second biggest twist in this book. He may be only 10 years old but he fought like he was Mat himself. His fairytales finally had come true and for once he saved Mat. Mat's maybe not his father by blood, but they surely share something. Cadsuane Melaidhrin was the one I hated the most. I sympathized more with some Forsakens than with her. I still can't understand her logic in wanting to break Rand only to \"help him laugh and cry again\". I still don't see how she had any impact on him. This was one of the most glorious scenes in the Last Battle. Lan did something that three men before him failed. He hid it for so long, but his will to live prevailed. Also, LAN SMILED. And we know that Nynaeve is the only one who gets his smiles. \u201cI have never known anyone else,\" Egwene said to him, \"who will work so hard to avoid hard work, Matrim Cauthon.\u201d \u201cYou are as eloquent as ever, Mat,\" Egwene said dryly. \"Do you still have your pet fox?\" \"I do,\" Mat said. \"He's snuggled up nice and warm.\u201d Mat and Egwene had a few funny encounters. I adore the fact that Mat succeeds to get under everyone's skin within seconds. He never lost his positive energy, but honestly I wish that sometimes he simply hung back. He gave me a few heart attacks. \u201cThe Empress will follow where you go,\" she said. \"So she will,\" Mat said. \"As I'll follow where she goes, I suppose. I hope that doesn't lead us in too many circles.\u201d \u201cWhen you saw me with a dagger in hand - as if to throw at you - you didn't call for your guards. You didn't fear I was here to kill you. You looked over your shoulder to see what I was aiming at. That's the most loving gesture I think a man could receive from a woman. Unless you'd like to sit on my knee for a while...\u201d I believe that Tuon and Mat are good together. He would've died of boredom if he got anything less life threatening. Also, all my doubt that she doesn't care for him are now gone. In this book, she obviously shown her feelings towards Mat. \u201cI have lived for four centures,\" he said. \"Perhaps I am still a youth, in that all of us are, compared to the timeless age of the Wheel itself. That said, I am one of the oldest people in existence.\" Moiraine smiled. \"Very nice. Does that work on the others?\" He hesitated. Then, oddly, he found himself grinning. \"It worked pretty well on Cadsuane.\" Words can't describe how much I have missed Moiraine. Arguably, she understands Rand better than anyone. Once upon a time, he hated that fact, but now he cherishes it. Their moments since the beginning of the series are priceless. \"There's an odd thing about disease I once heard, Fain,\" Matrim Cauthon whispered. \"Once you catch a disease and survive, you can't get it again.\u201d Yup, if I didn't die right there, I'll probably live for the next 100 years because now nothing can break me. Mat can get a bit careless because in his mind if he says he wants to stay away from trouble it means he'll get in the first battle lines. The Seanchan in the room seemed stunned that Mat had suddenly stripped to the waist. He did not see why, They had servants that wore much less. Light, but they did. \"I'm tempted to do the same as you,\" Min muttered, grabbing the front of her dress. Mat froze, then sputtered. He must have swallowed a fly or something. \"Burn me,\" he said, throwing on the shirt he dug out of the bundle. \"I'll give you a hundred Tar Valon marks if you do it, just so I can tell the story.\" Such a waste Mat and Min didn't have more scenes. He would've actually made of her a fun character. Truth be told, Mat makes everything and everyone fun. If it weren't for him and Egwene I would probably gave up on series after book 8 or 9. I have few complaints - no real interaction between Lan and Moiraine (I think we deserved at least one page), no real interaction between Lan and Nynaeve and no real interaction between all three ta'verens. Also, I expected that Galad and Rand will finally meet. Cadsuane, Alana and Alivia served no real purpose and the series could go easily without them. (view spoiler) [ I was convinced that Talmanes will die saving the dragons in Caemlyn. Honestly, after that battle he truly deserves to join the heroes of the Horn of Valere. That battle alone was almost as good as the battle at Fields of Merillor itself. Is it weird that I really liked Moridin, but I couldn't care less for Ishamael? I kinda felt sorry for Moridin. Maybe I romanticize him a bit, but I think his guilty conscience made him mad. He wanted to find peace, but in the wrong way. The Sharans fighting amongst Shadow was a jaw-dropping twist. When they appeared in Kandor, firstly I thought that no one besides Egwene stayed alive. Sharans are even more notorious than Seanchans. At least Seanchans aren't brainwashed. I still don't understand WHY Gawyn thought that going into suicidal fight will solve anything. He KNEW what he did will inexorably break Egwene and he still couldn't let go of his desires to be a hero. Keeping Egwene alive was a heroic act itself. He deserved what he got. His death made me angry and sad, but maybe even Egwene would still be alive if he was smarter. Egwene's death was what made me the most depressed. It never crossed my mind that she'll die. I thought Perrin or Nynaeve might fall, but never Egwene. I read though her death about 3 days ago and I still can't shake it. I feel like I've lost someone. I've read this series for 10 years, but I never thought that deaths would get to me in these lengths. I wish epilogue was longer. I'm glad that Rand is alive but I don't understand how's that possible? Did he swap bodies with Moridin after The Last Battle or did Alivia do something? How did Alivia help him die? How did Rand light his pipe? It bothers me that I don't know all the answers. (hide spoiler) ] ...more At last we are here, the final installment in the EPIC Wheel of Time.

(view spoiler) [ at least Nynaeve is wearing her hair down so the brain errr, I mean braid tugging\" was reduced (hide spoiler) ] . I hung on. I will say this, Brandon Sanderson seems to have been \"channeling\" Robert Jordan. For the first (3/4) three quarters to four fifths (4/5) of this book there is an unimaginable amount of waffle. I skipped and skimmed but be careful to take a line from J.K.Rowling, \"There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle.\" Unfortunately it's well buried. That being said, the last quarter to a fifth of the book begins to recapture the magic of the first 5 or 6 volumes. Yes at the first I loved this series. I was one of those who praised it, who said \"don't miss these books\". What happened after the 6th or so volume I have speculated on before. I have no idea. It went from one of the best told most well crafted fantasy tales I've ever read to a rambling Frankensteinian monstrosity of a soap opera crawling along at a glacial pace. Through 14 enormous volumes (if you don't count the prequel New Spring ). There are approximately 4,056,130 words to it (here I accept the total from Wikipedia, I didn't count) it slowly ground down it's fans to a hard core of you who love every letter. I sold all my own copies and read the last several out of the library. One 800+ page tome actually dropped back and covered events from the previous book... But the last fourth of this novel suddenly jumps back to the wonder of the first volumes. The end of the series is satisfying, well thought out and told in a fast moving tightly controlled way all the various threads (and there are now so many) pulled together. I'll say a couple of things below under a spoiler warning but on the whole I can strongly recommend this one, especially if you have followed it all the way through and for you who love every punctuation mark I'd think you'd love this. So, I can't go 5 (the first part of the volume is still slow moving, over done and repetitive ) I can go 4. Recommended. (view spoiler) [ Yes there are some belly drops here as we scatter the landscape with characters we've come to know and some things don't really work out as we'd like but still it is a good, satisfying and well handled climax and ending. I won't even under the spoiler spill the beans about what happens to who but I will say that I believe the fates of many people will strike different readers different ways. it may depend a lot on who you like and what annoyed you. (hide spoiler) ] I do still wish that the family would take the entire series and turn it over to a great editor (or a group of great editors) and cut out all the \"waffle\" from every volume. I say again, this could have been one of the all time great achievements in fantasy and literature and of any genre. I will always mourn what might have been. If I ever reread the series I may reread the first 5 or 6 and then jump to this one to tie it up. (view spoiler) [ we'll already know that Rand and Nynaeve FINALLY get around to cleansing the male half of the power and that slowly the Black Tower plot grows and so on.

(Sorry, couldn't help it) But the review of the last book of such a sprawling epic deserves a bit more than the usual liked it/didn't like it and diving into the whys & wherefores immediately. This really isn't an easy book to review. It's bloody book 14 (or 15 if you count the prequel, which started as a short story and grew beyond it) of a story that began in 1990 and the author died before completing it. 23 years later, we get the long awaited final volume, and it really is the end of the story. So here are my questions: 1. is it satisfying as a chapter in the saga? 2. is it a good book in its own right? 3. does it bring the series to a close in a rewarding fashion? 1. It certainly feels like one. It has a lot of the same merits and flaws of the earlier books: there's definitely bloated filler. There's a lot of very cool intertwined plots reaching resolution. The characters are still people you root for, and the whole thing is appropriately epic in scale. There are some inconsistencies from previous books that is frustrating; one character undergoes another personality shift that seems out of place (in this case I suspect it may be the result of what may have been written by Jordan before his death and what was written by Sanderson to knit it all together. Considering the work was edited by Jordan's widow I'm guessing his words were rarely touched). A critical plot point is achieved by means that are seemingly contradicted by established abilities from earlier volumes, and even if possible the occurrence in at least one case shows a shocking lack of preparedness and planning on behalf of at least one character that would certainly know better. 2. This is a harder question, as it's nigh-impossible to separate it from the rest of the saga at this point. (someone who picked it up would be completely baffled and probably deeply bored) So you have to set a little of that aside when evaluating this one. But there are some definite problems. two critical character behave in ways that are simply not credible at this point; their opposition to Rand is a misguided attempt to ratchet up the conflict and heighten suspense, but by doing it with people that have been shown to be both intelligent and generally wise makes the whole thing ring hollow. Another character's destiny is finally realized...by throwing 4 other heroes essentially under the bus, at least 1 making an unbelievable mistake/oversight, leading to the entirely predictable next step. Considering what's gone before, leaving this character out of it at the start is fairly absurd. So it's not a great book. Too many frustrating things, but they are balanced out by the poignant moments, laugh out loud funny lines, and actually earned triumphs. 3. This is the toughest one of all. Closing out a series that's been going on for 23 years over this many books in a way that even a majority of the readers will find emotionally satisfying is incredibly hard. You also have to balance a logical evolution from where the books have built vs avoiding being utterly predictable. Who lives & who dies is one of those challenges: it's not badly done, I think, but several characters deserved a greater resolution to their story considering how much time we spent with them. Of the 10 or 12 major characters only a handful really get a wrap-up that feels satisfying (and several of them have to be presumed not seen). There's also a couple of resolutions to on-going mysteries that are solved by Rand/Min...off screen, which has never happened before. There's always at least been a hat-tip to the reader that the character has figured something out, even if they haven't clued us in as to their thinking. That'd be ok for smaller things, but for something that's been hanging over the series for half a dozen books or more? On the other hand, a number of other things are handled incredibly well, especially the final confrontation with the Dark One. More than anything else, that one felt earned and proper. So where do we finally end? Appropriately, right about where most of the series lies. It's often brilliant, incredibly ambitious, often bloated and lazy, epic in scope but sometimes poorly managed, creative as hell, and a fully realized world. the attention to detail and care for creation of legends makes this far better than such bloated plotting would normally be. (seriously, having your wife as editor might not be a great plan, and it's more obvious that once an author reaches a certain point the publisher isn;t going to put the hammer down no matter how badly something needs a hardcore pruning. George R. R. Martin are your ears burning? They should be.) Jordan does do a rather impressive job in taking his core characters through their heroic evolution in interesting ways and building them into unique individuals who all played critical parts in the story without them turning into sidekicks or getting undeserved wins or credit. Jordan uses the pattern/thread metaphors liberally (and honestly he does it in ways that make sense for the world he's built, not as lazy writing or for cheap points) but a painting makes a better analogy for how his earliest, core group fits for this story: one character may be the brightest, most liberally used color, but they all are important to whole and the whole doesn't make sense or work without all of them blended into the final picture. Man, I'm getting as long-winded as Jordan/Sanderson! There's a lot to like here, but more frustrations than I'd like to see in the capstone, which is why I can't go any higher (although I do still wish for 1/2 stars here 3 1/2 is closer to where I am than 3). The earlier books were ones that I went back to fairly often (books 1, 3-6, & 11 with books 1 & 4 being especially good. book 4 is my personal favorite, I think) but as things drew out longer and longer the books have less and less to draw you back to revisit. ...more A Memory of The Wheel of Time Three or so years ago I moved churches in the wake of a crisis at my previous church. One of the very first people I met at this new church was the associate pastor and that day before I left he came up to me and said, 'so I hear you're into fantasy books.' At least he said something along those lines. I of course indicated that yeah I was into fantasy books. His final parting comment was 'Get on the Wheel of Time, it's a must read fantasy series. The guy who wrote i A Memory of The Wheel of Time Three or so years ago I moved churches in the wake of a crisis at my previous church. One of the very first people I met at this new church was the associate pastor and that day before I left he came up to me and said, 'so I hear you're into fantasy books.' At least he said something along those lines. I of course indicated that yeah I was into fantasy books. His final parting comment was 'Get on the Wheel of Time, it's a must read fantasy series. The guy who wrote it died sadly before finishing it but some other guy is finishing it instead.' Well I went away and decided to look into this Wheel of Time stuff, in fact I decided to look it up online. What I read about the magic and the creatures and the characters interested me. It sounded like a clich\u00e9 fantasy novel without the overwrought clich\u00e9, rather a novel that used an archetypical fantasy setting to tell its own story. It turned out that I couldn't get the first novel, so I picked up the second and read part of the way through it before deciding that it wasn't working and I'd pick it up later. The next thing I knew the third book was at the library and then suddenly it was on top of another stack of borrowed books at home. Starting the third book was what really drew me into this story, I saw the amazing ideas and world-building spread out before me as the author told a fascinating story. Sure, there were bits of information I missed (which I caught up on through Wikipedia and going back to read the first few books) but the book was remarkable in how different it was to anything I'd read written after Tolkien. Sure, Eragon had been fun but it lacked intellectual depth and was a mixture of different stories which where in themselves archetypical. The Sword of Shannara was fun but incredibly unoriginal with its sequels being better yet still remarkably derivative. The myths, legends and fairytales I grew up with were good but overly familiar, they were not fresh or fascinating in the way that reading a new fantasy story could be. The Wheel of Time as a series was compelling and fascinating, and to this day more intriguing to me as a fantasy epic than other novels I have read. The only books to compare with it in epic fantasy are Gardens of the Moon , A Game of Thrones , The Name of the Wind and anything by Brandon Sanderson. The reason I write this reflection is to serve as an indication of the investment I made in this series. It may be a small one compared to those who have followed this series for the decades in which it stretched yet it is an investment nonetheless and when one makes an investment in regards to any novel there is always the expectation of an emotional reward at the end. Series in particular demand a reward for your diligence in putting you as a reader through so many trials and tribulations. There are those series which end anticlimactically, for instance as a teen I found The Singing a very anticlimactic ending to an interesting series. There are those series which end with a shock twist as in The Hero of Ages . And there are those series that end as The Wheel of Time does. Gracefully, with honour and majesty, and in the way they deserve to. A Memory of Light As a novel A Memory of Light does have its flaws. For instance some characters are more or less ignored until close to the end then casually and easily disposed of while not given the truly climactic death I as a reader was hoping for. However I find such a thing fascinating in that it creates a realistic edge to this novel. As this is a fantasy novel one could be forgiven for arguing that 'realism' is something that can be done without. To an extent this is true, no one wants realism to be pursued to the extent where the reader is told everything about the exact weather patterns for the different environments alongside how Aes Sedai have their tea and what the mating rituals of Trollocs are. Yet one does expect that a fantasy novel does have a sense of the real to the point where it reflects on reality and the fact that there are unsatisfactory conclusions to some characters does create that sense. After all, reality is no neatly packaged fairytale. Question: So what is in this novel? Answer: A stunning conclusion, in fact a breathtaking conclusion. There is a high death toll, plenty of conclusions to character threads, tons of action and a gripping story that is the summation of thousands of pages. Everything in the series has been leading to this book and it delivers. Perhaps some others will find themselves jaded by the length it has taken to get to this book yet I found this an emotionally charged final chapter. I find that I know when I great conclusion has been written in that it leaves me feeling both emotionally satisfied and wanting a little more. This is what this conclusion successfully achieved for me. (view spoiler) [I personally appreciated the ending with Rand, the tragic hero of our fantasy epic, being reduced to the new role of an unknown man, a role he has always wanted. Such is the role of heroes in the pattern of the Wheel of Time, where men constantly change. (hide spoiler) ] Ultimately I'm sad to see the end of this book series. Yet all readers of this series know that there is no true ending to The Wheel of Time and the characters within the pattern. And that is why this book succeeds. It leaves the reader understanding that though this part of the fantasy tale is over the deeper ideas and the true hidden beauty of the story remains. As history is bound to repeat itself so too may The Wheel of Time repeat itself again and again with its heroes arising again to face new conflicts.

And most importantly what will become of Rand al'Thor without the One or True Power and perhaps, the power of his will? (hide spoiler) ] The Wheel of Time turns... The Wheel of Time, as can be told by the title, has many references to other religious and spiritual movements along with mythologies, legends and fantasy works. It is the particular 'weave' of ideas and references which work to make it a unique series. Yet at the same time this particular tendency to refer to other ideas is a double edged sword, like Callandor in this novel. In fact much of Robert Jordan's work in The Wheel of Time series is a double edged sword. His writing style is at once verbose and charming with the occasional clumsy phrase and expression. His world-building while impressive is often too overdrawn, leading to the great length of the series. Indeed these various elements are both a great power in the novels and a curse, leading to the polarising nature of the series. For while they have great strengths they also have great weaknesses. One thing I haven't properly done in my reviews of the various books in the series is discuss the aspects which I find of particular depth in the series. I perhaps have done this in part, but not in full. Male/female relationships The male/female relationships and dynamics in the entire series are some of the most criticised elements. Yet, they are criticised for good reason. Try as he does, Robert Jordan lacks a true understanding of women when compared to other greater male writers. Perhaps there are elements which are true about his female characters at times yet they are for the most part, often highly stereotypical depictions. The braid tugging and tendency to bully male characters is a fine indication of this. It appears to me that Jordan holds a juvenile perspective of women, and as such writes female characters which are more often girls than true women. Speaking from a little experience I know very few women who would constantly tell a man how everything he does is inferior, yet I know several girls who would more readily state this, along with the statement that 'girl's rule and boy's suck'. In connection he perpetuates the myth that many women are closet lesbians until they 'grow up' with his ridiculous idea of Aes Sedai pillow friends. Something that is slightly balanced in this novel with the hints that gay male characters actually exist. It is this facet of Jordan's world which creates the idea that fantasy is a 'boy-zone' when connected to the fantasy of Tolkien ( The Hobbit is remarkably woman free) or G.R.R Martin (his depiction of female sexuality being very centred around a male perspective). Yet, as mentioned Jordan does try to write strong women and a world in which women are treated fairly. The countries of his world are often matriarchal or evenly balanced in leadership, it is men who lack the powers of magic until later on and there do exist several female characters who break from the normal stereotyping of this world. For instance Tuon, Faile and Egwene (Egwene particularly more so in the last three books than the first). Politics There is nothing especially extraordinary about the political systems of Robert Jordan's world. However it is worth noting that politics plays a large role in the entire story particularly when it comes to aspects like The Game of Houses and getting countries to agree to different proposals and alliances. History The idea of history repeating itself is one that is fully present in this series as I've mentioned before. The reincarnation element whereby heroes are reborn into the Wheel when they are needed again is a great symbolic indicator of this. Then again, the fact that the series centres around prophecies and villains rising up from centuries earlier is another. Later on in the series the various characters reveal further aspects of how history repeats itself with the discovery of new abilities from the past. (view spoiler) [Mat has his old lives awoken again in his memory, Rand becomes one with Lews Therin, Egwene discovers travelling and dreaming and Perrin discovers the wolf abilities. At the same time the Seanchan invasion is a further sign of history repeating itself, as they are descended from the past Artur Hawkwing's armies. (hide spoiler) ] Transformation and heroism Though The Wheel of Time series has become the whipping boy example of the 'farmboy becomes a hero' fantasy clich\u00e9 I believe the story goes far beyond this clich\u00e9 idea. Though our main ta'veren characters do all come from villages, their pathways towards hero status are unique and fraught with many tragic and glorious twists and turns. Admittedly the first novel, in seeking to establish itself in the epic tradition, relies upon this village dweller to hero idea almost too strongly. Yet the later novels move away from this and towards a sense of originality whereby characters such as Rand, Mat and Perrin become heroes. It is this sense that anyone can become a hero in the Wheel of Time that is appealing, as is the idea that any hero can fall or be turned to the Shadow. Rand is a fascinating character as a hero prophesied to die and restricted by a fate woven out for him in advance through prophecy. It is intriguing how Jordan deals with the dilemma of an all powerful 'messiah' figure in Rand, making him suffer many losses and emotional struggles before reaching the Last Battle at the end. Mat again is another intriguing character and one must suspect that Robert Jordan divulged a lot of his own personality into Mat while avoiding transforming him into an object of wish fulfilment. Mat is the heroic figure who refuses to be captured by plans and regulations and who sees himself as no hero or lord. He is chaotically good and though he never seems to be in the right place when needed he eventually makes his way to where he should be. Perrin again is a different type of hero. He is the hero who struggles with the 'primitive' wolf side of his personality. A man, like Mat, not trying to be a leader, yet he does it out of a sense of personal duty rather than because he avoids commitment. Morality Though much fantasy is often considerably cardboard in its morality I do not see this as a problem in The Wheel of Time series. Though we have an ultimate battle between good and evil this does not necessarily mean that the morality is black and white. There are many Dark friends who perform good deeds and there are many heroes who turn toward darkness. In a time where many fantasy writers attempt to create moral ambiguity (often forming a complete lack of moral guidance for their characters) through forced writing I see Robert Jordan's world as naturally exploring good, evil and the in-between areas. (view spoiler) [Rand's use of balefire to destroy Graendal's palace is a fine example of this moral ambiguity. (hide spoiler) ] This final chapter particularly emphasises the fine line between good and evil in how the Whitecloaks and Seanchan are required to work with those who consider them as an evil second only to Shadowspawn. (view spoiler) [The climactic scenes where Rand confronts the Dark One are also fascinating from this perspective as they consider whether he is truly evil or simply acting out of his nature. Rand's conclusion is that it is men and not the Dark One which are the greatest source of evil, an idea which is confronting and powerful. I particularly liked that this series had a true confrontation with The Dark One as rarely do fantasy novels truly confront the evil threat in their pages. (hide spoiler) ] Magic The magic system of Robert Jordan's world is one that has been used before. The idea of five elements of water, earth, air, fire and spirit is one that has existed for centuries. Yet the way in which Jordan uses this concept is unique. Creating a magical system called the One Power and then dividing it into female and male halves is a fascinating way of approaching magic. Added to this is the idea that the combinations of these 'elements' of the One Power create different weaves which produce different magical effects. Unlike other fantasy novels, Robert Jordan's magic is also, as Brandon Sanderson explains it, both a hard and a soft magic system. Hard magic systems are strongly defined with laws and regulations built in, much like how the One Power works with channelling. However there are also soft magic system elements, the sense that magic in this world is a free agent and capable of doing extraordinary things that cannot be logically explained. A Tolkien clone? One could be forgiven for labelling this series as a Tolkien clone. Yet I do not believe it is so simple as that. Though there are similarities to Tolkien's work it bears more similarity in my mind to a combination of the legends of King Arthur, religious influences and the Greek/Roman/Celtic mythologies. It reminds me in places of The Once and Future King (one of the greatest fantasy works) and yet it stands alone. I challenge you to not read this as simply another Tolkienesque series but as a series that stands on its own. There are no endings to the Wheel of Time I have thoroughly enjoyed reading these novels. And at the end of the day if there is one thing that any novel should be able to do it is to create joy. I do not refer to mere escapism for escapism's sake, however. I refer to the way in which a novel can touch and individual, shape them and allow them to find pleasure in their reality. The way in which a novel. Often as a readers I can get caught up in trying to read 'highbrow literature' because I simply understand that I should. And as such I take the pleasure out of reading. Yet reading should exist to remind us that there are joys in life and that there is great beauty, for what is more beautiful than language and being able to communicate with other individuals? I certainly have found moments of beauty in this series and hopefully will into the future. ...more 'The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.

A MEMORY OF LIGHT is the fourteenth and final book of The Wheel of Time. Most who have read the series have travelled its paths for years, walking alongside characters who became dear friends or dire foes. Most who have read the series have devoted substantial amounts of time, effort and emotion to the journey. In enjoying such devotion to their creation, the authors, Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, have accrued an enormous debt that must be repaid in this final book. Was the investment worth it, is the debt repaid? Yes. I swear by the Light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth, the investment was more than worth it, A MEMORY OF LIGHT repays the debt a thousandfold. And this is where I start to gush ... So often when I read books, I wonder 'How does anyone come up with such an amazing story?' Never has that sentiment assailed me as strongly as it did while I read A MEMORY OF LIGHT. The sheer number of threads that are pulled together in this book to create the pattern of its conclusion is staggering. Being able to pull them all together at all is a feat worthy of awe. But being able to pull them together with so much assured STYLE is a triumph. Every single one of this book's 900-odd pages is packed with action, complexity and poignancy. I laughed, I cried, and by the time I had finished, I was physically weary - I did feel like I had been a participant in the Last Battle. And the ultimate conclusion to the story was everything I could have hoped, everything it needed to be. What more can a reader ask for? Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, I salute you, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the Wheel of Time. I am not so much a religious person as I am a person who knows what she believes in: I believe in the power of story. I believe in A MEMORY OF LIGHT. ...more This series started out with a bang and was on its way to becoming one of the best epic fantasy series written.

My hopes were dashed when Jordan died, but were resurrected when it was announced that Brandon Sanderson would finish the series. Sanderson's first two volumes (12 and 13) were very good and even had some of the brilliance of the first five volumes. I eagerly awaited the 14th (last) volume. What can I say? This volume is equal to the poorest that Jordan produced. It is at least 600 pages too long, and is a chore to read. I stuck with it to find out how everything ends, but at times it was like getting a root canal. Too much time was spent on new or minor characters and battles, with far too little time devoted to Rand and the fight with the Dark One. The dialog was stilted and the battles poorly described (for superb battle scenes, check out Joe Abercrombie's works) and they were unrealistic, even for fantasy. New enemies appeared without any foundation and deus ex machina was rampant, especially on the side of evil. What an absolute shame that a series that held so much promise should have ended so poorly. ...more All right, so here we go.

For example, the overwhelming forces were ... and then, the sentence after that, they were overwhelmed. And such like. Moreover, the battle descriptions were more like sitrep, and did not really pull in too deeply. A few people died, no biggie. I wasn't shocked by it. Well, it was sort of expected. In fact, there's a certain lack of cruelty in the book. For instance, Elayne threatens to hang people robbing bodies on the battlefield. Really? Just threatens? It's the end of the world, and she gives them a warning? But that's fine. For a 1,000-page battle, it's not exhausting. I was able to keep on reading, even though nothing super really special changes, and the series culminates toward the big bang battle between Rand and the Dark One. BS pulled a decent balance between the different elements and characters, and managed to bring back most of the old fun and lore. He invoked that sweet melancholy and Tolkienesque warmth that made the first four books so wonderful. He gave us a splendid finish to a long, tiring race, and helped us forget the endless books of dresses, flowers and other stupid descriptions. Just for that, he deserves five stars. He saved it.

And while AMOL has a few almost debilitating scenes as well as some truly exquisite moments, it bests the biggest obstacle in its way: ending a series that has been going for over two decades and survived it's own creator with aplomb. None of this means that I believe A Memory of Light is a fantastic book, or that the Wheel of Time represents the pinnacle of high fantasy (neither are true); much like the series itself, much of AMOL is repetitive and certain chapters can be chores to read, even though they could be well written (how long can a reader follow characters that are exhausted from war without becoming exhausted themselves?). And where the series is fractured and tangential, AMOL is highly focused and driven, almost to a fault. But the Wheel of Time has always been a fatally flawed series that relied on the occasional iconic scene to lift the rest of an otherwise dull book focused around two dimensional characters, and AMOL isn't much different. Sanderson never rises to the heights that Jordan was capable of, but he has made Jordan's characters far more readable, though Sanderson still allots too much time hand-waving away irrelevant story-lines that were left to fester through 11 previous books by Jordan without any real gratification. But none of that matters. Not really. The Wheel of Time is the raison d'etre of modern high fantasy and reading it is like looking through the dissolved history of the genre. It's a throwback to classic tales like the Belgariad and Dragonriders of Pern, while also serving as the foundation for the modern epics like Malazan and the more light-hearted tales like the Gentlemen Bastards. A Memory of Light is an immensely satisfying-if-flawed ending to the series, so it's hard to give it anything but 5 stars. ...more Given that this is the end of an era, I thought you might be interested in how my journey through AMOL went. 27/01/2013: Obtain book.

Worse than the fact I don't remember half these characters is that half of them have changed names, physical appearance and what-not during the course of the last 13 books.

Having finished it, finally, all I can say is that I am exhausted. And (Robert Jordan/Brandon Sanderson fans will hate me for this, I know)...it just wasn't all that fun , you know?
