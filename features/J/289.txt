There were some things in this book that genuinely disturbed me, and I\u2019m going to point them out.. Before I do, though, I have to tell you, I loved the book over all. But I\u2019m probably not going to sound like it... Firstly, there are more language issues with this book. Farid uses the B word twice, and quite a few of the other characters use the D word a lot. The D word was in the first book a bit, but not nearly so much. And the B word is what really disturbed me. It was completely unnecessary, and brings the novel down a peg because of it. (I regard this as more of a children's book because of the age of the main character, this is why it affects my rating) Secondly, <---C>Meggie</---C> is only 13 and the entire romance between her and Farid is really annoying. Not so much that they \"love\" each other, but that they're so young! If Funke wanted it to be a \u201cromance,\u201d she ought to have made Meggie at least 16 in this book. Of course I think that\u2019s still too young, but it\u2019s better than just 13! I don\u2019t care how grown up she looks . Also I don't think that just because the girls in the Inkworld get married when they\u2019re Meggie\u2019s age means that Meggie would want to get married at 13 or that she should get married at 13. I just really think the whole little romance thing was way overplayed... :/ But here\u2019s a little on the up side\u2026 I liked the over all story in this one better than the last. The Wayless Wood makes me think of Sherwood Forest. Actually\u2026the entire story kind of has a Robin Hood feel to it. The Bluejay is kind of a copy of Robin Hood.<---F> Different? Yes</---F>. But it even says that he \u201csteals from the rich to give to the poor.\u201d Now is that original? No. But it\u2019s okay, because Funke manages to make the Bluejay seem less like a copout of Robin, and more intriguing to the story. ...more After enjoying \"Inkheart,\" the first book in this trilogy, \"<+++>Inkspell</+++>\" was a huge disappointment. First, I thought Meggie's character suffered a tremendous loss in her falling in love with Farid. She became less independent and less self-reliant. Their relationship struck me as unbelievable, as well, which angered me to think of kids leaving this book with the idea that relationships work like Meggie's and Farid's. Writers of young adult fiction should be more responsible! Furthermore, I felt the After enjoying \"Inkheart,\" the first book in this trilogy, \"<+++>Inkspell</+++>\" was a huge disappointment.

Their relationship struck me as unbelievable, as well, which angered me to think of kids leaving this book with the idea that relationships work like Meggie's and Farid's. Writers of young adult fiction should be more responsible! Furthermore, I felt the writing dropped in quality; Funke did more telling than showing, and as a result I had a hard time staying present with the characters. I wonder if she planned to write a trilogy when she began \"Inkheart\"... \"Inkheart\" was just richer and more believable. This book, it seems like there are too many threads and she's having a hard time keeping track of them all. I'm hoping the last book will be better. Finally, I was disturbed by the trials Funke put her characters through. Prison, death threats, kidnappings--the ways the characters handled these, I felt, was unrealistic. I think my opinion would be different if these situations didn't strike so close to home. Why don't any of the characters show symptoms of PTSD? Fighting bad guys just isn't as easy as she made it seem. ...more Cornelia, you need a better editor. Your editor would tell you to figure out which characters are essential and kill off the rest. The difficulty with the book is that it's written for younger kids, but it is too complicated, not all of the storylines are as riveting as the rest, and there are too many complicated emotions for young readers to comprehend or enjoy. The characters are a bit static (and thus predictable), as well. This isn't to say that the emotions aren't realistic, or that the ch Cornelia, you need a better editor.

This isn't to say that the emotions aren't realistic, or that the characters don't act true to form, or that the story isn't well-plotted. There's just too much of it to be enjoyable. In other words, it's too Harry Potter-esque to be fabulous. On the other hand, this book is about 200% better than Inkheart. It doesn't ramble as badly, it has a relatively straight plotline, and the precipitous drops in suspense suffered by Inkheart are nearly invisible in Funke's second effort. The flat relationship between Mo and Resa is balanced by Meggie and Farid, the plot moves along in a confined space and time, and Dustfinger - the real mover and shaker in the plot - finally gets equal time. It's just a shame that you have to read Inkheart to be able to really understand and enjoy Inkspell. ...more Inkspell - one word, one adventure. With a completely original idea, a great plot, and a fantastic overall fantasy, this story's got it made. I absolutely loved it. Inkheart and Inkspell have become some of my favorite books. Dustfinger - the clear winner for my favorite character, I have to agree with Orpheus there. He can hide his feelings at will, which is very admirable (just ask Farid). He believes himself to be cowardly, but he will go to great heights for the ones he cares about, such as Inkspell - one word, one adventure.

He believes himself to be cowardly, but he will go to great heights for the ones he cares about, such as Farid and Roxane. He truly does have feelings, although you may not be able to tell just from his face. I loved the ending - it made me want more, made me want to keep on reading. Oddly enough, it reminded me of Star Wars III, when it seemed that all hope was lost and the Dark Side was going to win. The Adderhead is immortal (I see him as the Chancellor in Inkspell), Dustfinger is dead (of which I was so sad!), and Orpheus is in Inkworld acting like a stuck-up egotistical megalomaniac who owns the world. Hopefully the situation will become better as time goes on...in Inkdeath. ...more Tintenblut=Inkspell (Inkworld, #2), <---A>Cornelia Funke</---A> \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0637\u0644\u0633\u0645 \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u06cc -

I think part of the problem is that pretty much *everyone* in the book is a POV character.

The only difference is after reading the second book my immediate thought was, \"That was stupid\" I honestly can't remember the last time I felt so let down by a book. The characters are so poorly developed that I found myself not caring in the least when something bad happened to them and for that matter I don't really think I could tell you anything descriptive about the characters aside from maybe hair color. I know a lot of people are raving about this series and that is what peaked my interest initially and they are even making a film from the first, but I just don't get it. The author has made this dream world where words come to life, an interesting concept in itself. However when you take that concept to ridiculous levels where whenever there is a problem they just write themselves some unimaginative way to get out of it, it gets old fast. I know personally I won't even bother reading the third installment, for me it's too late to save it now and I have much better things on my bookshelf. ...more I'm glad that Inkspell kept up the same daring modern fantasy elements as the previous in the series, but also that it brought some new things into the story that were completely unexpected. It was sad about Dustfinger though, so I hope that the third in the series is able to resolve it in some way. Meggi, Mo \"et al\" continue in the story taking place in two worlds.

Xo, Rach ...more Bei dem Ende muss ich ganz bald den letzten Band lesen! :( Aber es war ein grandioser Band!

They may sometimes seem intimidating but there's no better way to get attached to the characters, feel their struggles, live and breathe with them like you were exactly there. And there's obviously a reason I love the Inkworld books so much. Because they are literally a mixture of fun, heartbreak, quotes and trivia about books and book binding and a beautiful, beautiful world. In this book, Meggie annoyed me a little when I started reading it. Her obsession with her Inkworld, despite what her parents had been through, made me worry a lot about her motives but at the same time reminded me of myself and my (and every bookworm's) longing to feel a new, magical world, different from our real one on my skin. She later fixed it, though, as she became this adorable hero we all know and love *claps hands* This book taught me, once and for all, how easy it is to escape this world with the help of books This book was kind of dark for the middle grade category, and that's why I probably loved it even more than Inkheart. Huge character development, a beautifully spun story and a new setting, full of life and secrets to uncover. I also have to confess my slight crush on Mo Folchart. I MEAN LOOK AT THIS RAY OF SUNSHINE!!! Anyways. I was so glad to find more about Dustfinger and Resa's past and I am so glad I did. Also, Fenoglio in this book crossed the line with his stupid ideas and arrogance. A wide cast of new characters was introduced in this book, since it is set in the Inkworld. The way Cornelia Funke describes the Inkworld has me at the edge of my seat. All these original monsters and creatures, that she invented make me smile or blink with surprise. Fire elves? Night-Mares? Silvertongues? (obviously). She's just awesome, nothing more to say. Also, this book had tons of plot twists and surprises that I fell in love with. Overall thoughts? Excited for Inkdeath. End of story. ~TOTALLY recommended Mary ...more so yea..the same as inkheart!!!!!!! I actually enjoyed this book sooo much better than the first one.

He is one of my favorite characters and I had to admire the author for actually killing him off, since he is such a favorite character (although I think he will be back in the third book). There were a couple things that I didn't like in the book. First, she threw in a bit more language in this book. Language in books doesn't really bother me, but when you are targeting children to read the book, I don't think swear words are appropriate. It also threw me to find out that Meggie was only 13. I had imagined her older, especially when she gets into a very grown-up relationship with Farid. Maybe having never had a boyfriend until college I don't understand kid love, but to consider staying in a dream world, leaving your family and loved ones, to stay with a boy, all when you're 13 is a little bit crazy to me. She should have made Meggie older. I did think her writing was much better. I didn't feel quite the translation gap like I did in the first book. I also thought the plot was a lot more stimulating. I really didn't want to put it down at a few parts. So all in all, much better than the first and it actually made me want to read the third. ...more I'll put it bluntly: It made me miserable.

And having laws that unjust and cruel -- that REALLY screws me up... BUT, on the bright side: There is a development taking place in Meggie's life. It was cute and exciting -- Yes. But thrilling -- No. The ending in the story was kinda \"ouch\". But the book did , did a great success on making me feel what the Motley folks felt with their... island/country[?]. I felt sympathy and pity for their unjust situations and their tragedies. Especially Dustfinger's and Farid's! Um, anyway, that's my opinion. But to those who think/feels otherwise, you're welcome to state yours. ...more Druh\u00fd d\u00edl trilogie mi pomohl uv\u011bdomit si, \u017ee tahle s\u00e9rie je moje guilty pleasure.

I read this book as a buddy read with a friend here on Good Reads, and since I enjoyed the first book, Inkheart , and it's world building so much I thought I should get to this one as soon as I could. I am glad that I decided to get into this series, but I must say it is a pretty complex story and is definitely not light reading.

In Inkheart we learn that Mo, Meggie's father, can read characters out of the books that he reads aloud. Well this one continues on with all those great characters and several new characters for readers to enjoy as well. You have to pay attention to what you are reading in this book though because the story and the characters both are very complex. It really is not a light read, but it has a beautiful world with a lot of great imagery. The characters in this story are very well developed, vibrant and complex. There are plenty of characters to hate as well. I really enjoy Meggie and Dustfinger the most I think. They are both very likable. I think they just get better with each of the books in this trilogy and I certainly look forward to spending some more time with them. I recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy. It has great world building with a pretty complex plot line and characters. I do look forward to the last book in the series Inkdeath. I am sure it will have an amazing conclusion. ...more I will admit that this book was actually a chore for me to get through. However, I gave it two stars because I liked the idea of the story.

The biggest let down with this series, and the reason that I had such a hard time finishing this book, was the characters. I know that it may be a personal bias, but I didn't feel a connection to any of the characters, which were weak at best, and I absolutely hated the main character. I don't even remember her name, or anything about her personality. Did she even have one? Did anyone? With such cardboard characters I guess I didn't feel compelled to keep reading because I didn't care about what happened to them. I didn't even know that there is a third book in this series, and I doubt that I'll bother to read it. It's been a long time since I read this book, but I don't feel compelled to read it again either. ...more I will admit up front that I have a bias that is making it difficult for me to give this book a \"fair\" shake.

While Inkheart did a moderately decent job of fleshing out a couple of the characters, Inkspell did not further that cause doing little to expand upon what you already knew about the characters and new characters were very two-dimensional. More importantly, this book has situations that are completely inappropriate for a child of my daughter's age (shame on me I guess for not exercising due diligence before she read the book). Specifically, a greater degree of explicit violence than the first as well as 14 year olds engaged in sexual relationships with married men. At best it would be a 3 star book, regardless of my bias, but given who t hey are targeting the book towards it's barely a 2. ...more Es una bonita historia, pero es demasiado extensa, est\u00e1 innecesariamente alargada.

Dustfinger was finally read back home. He was read into the book by Orpheus. I was happy for him. Farid was not with him. Farid followed Dustfinger like a puppy. Meggie really wanted to know what was going on in the world of Inkheart. She decides to read herself and Farid into the book. The only reason is because Dustfinger was in danger. After that Mo, Resa, Mortala, and Basta were read into the book. Mo got shot by modern weapons. Weapons that the Inkworld had no knowledge of. My heart broke into pieces. There were so many more events. This one really made me want to see what happened in the last one. The ending killed me...I just wanted to die...my heart broke completely. It made me question if they were ever going to leave the Inkworld. This book was honestly great. I enjoyed every single moment I was reading it like the first one. Characters: 5 stars out of 5. Meggie is still very annoying. Ugh. I really wish she was different. It's only because of her age. If she was older. I probably would like her more. I also felt she didn't know what true love was since she had feelings for Farid. Mo is still one of my favorites. I also loved his wife. Dustfinger is still my favorite throughout this one. What he did at the end made me want to cry and scream...why would he do this too me. Farid I did like him at certain points. Orpheus I really hated him. I wanted him to get killed. He is a horrible human being. He is really stuck up. I couldn't stand his attitude. I will talk more about him in the review for the third book. My hate for him is very strong. Writing Style: 5 stars out of 5. ...more I found this sequel to Inkheart to be almost as good as its predecessor. The magic and amazing characters are still there along with a whole batch of new ones. Ms. Funke has a knack for creating very vivid and memorable characters and her world building skills are amongst some of the best.

It makes things a lot more interesting when the characters can't just do whatever they want whenever they want. The second book takes place primarily IN the book, Inkheart. Some of the characters (I won't say whom in order to prevent spoilers of Inkheart) are pulled into the book and the main storyline follows their adventures in the Inkheart world. Overall, this book has much of the adventure of the first one although at times the story does seem to drag a bit. All in all, though, I still really enjoyed it and would recommend it as a solid follow up to the first novel in the series. Once again, this series contains many dark and scary elements, so be a little careful about exposing it to children under the age of 10. Use your own best judgement. ...more Interesting concept, boring execution: I talked to a friend the other day about why this series is disappointing to me. This book series has so many things that I should love, I noted. It talks about love for literature, vibrant fantasy lands, and the ability to jump in and out of novels. Yet, instead of feeling the same excitement when broached with a similar topic in The Eyre Affair, I felt detached. Why is this? She responded simply, because its boring. That\u2019s it really.

For some reason, this story which should appeal to me on so many levels, felt like a drag to read, and I had to practically assign myself pages. I don\u2019t know whether this is the fault of the translator, as some have assured me that it is better in its original text, or or some other issue. Is it because it feels childish or awkward? I have yet to decide. I am determined to finish the series; however, to give Funke a full three books to win me over. Perhaps she will, but so far, if you\u2019re looking for literary adventures, I would try Mr. Jasper Fforde. ...more It took such a long time to read and finish it at last...Part of because I didn't find much time to actually read, and because it was dragged out so much.
