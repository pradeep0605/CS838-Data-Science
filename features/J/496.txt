I kind alike it :) It's more focused on vampires,<---M> werewolves and valkyries</---M>, and not everything is explained yet, but I'm looking forward to finding out more about everything in the following books :) The story After being imprisoned and tortured for decades, Lachlain finally finds what he needs in order to escape.<---F> His mate</---F>. Emma is very gentle and fragile, definitely not someone he expected to be his forever, and especially when he finds out she is a vampire, his mortal enemy. He plans his revenge against the people who imprisoned him, and the best way to accomplish that is through Emma... This was a great intro into the series, not too overwhelming with information, and yet everything was explained that needed to be. The beginning was very shocking, well at least to me because I started it without knowing a single fact about this, expect that it had vampires. I actually thought HE was a vampire, so imagine my shock when I found out he wasn't :DDD The ending was a bit eye-rolling, with the bad guy and so on, but oh well, could've been worse so I'm not complaining :) But I want an epilogue or something :( it ended too abruptly for my taste :(((((( Emma She is shy, innocent, fragile little half vampire/half valkyrie. So being kidnapped and treated roughly by Lachlain is not something she is good at handling. She kinda got on my nerves in the beginning, with being so fragile and all, but as it went on, her personality changed as well and she grew on me :) The big revelation in the end was a huge DUH! and totally not a shock XD Lachlain I love him <3 His Scottish accent <3 His uber-possessiveness <3 I even loved when he was an uber-jerk to her <3 He wants revenge against the vampires and figures Emma will be the best way to help him with that. Of course, when he gets to know her better, he realises he has to keep her as his own :D eheheheheheheh I don't want to make this an uber-swoon-fest about him, but basically I loved the hell out of him and everything he did here :))) The sex This is the part that really, but really surprised me while listening. Maybe it was the combo of the narrator doing freaky voices, for one creeping me out when he did him, and for two making me laugh like crazy when he did her. BUT! The first sex... (view spoiler) [was during a full moon when the beast took over him and he f*cked her in half-beast form for the entire night. (hide spoiler) ] It was a total mood-killer for me, I didn't enjoy it at all :( It actually made me drop a star because gah, I just hated it :D Maybe because this is such a normal PNR, I just didn't expect it, but I'm thinking in situations like these it goes to the category of MONSTER-SEX!!!!!!! Oh well. Overall 3,5-4 stars for this one. It kept my attention throughout the audio, I didn't want to stop listening even though it was funny at places it wasn't supposed to be, I didn't find it hot where I was supposed to, but the fact that I enjoyed the whole audio even with all of the things that bothered me says something. I honestly have no idea how I would've liked this if I've read it. For one, I could'be get his perfect Scottish accent <3<3<3 The shock value was huge because of listening to it. But then the sex probably wouldn't be so creepy if not for the voices he did for the guy. And I wouldn't laugh like a lunatic at everything the woman said. Well, whatever :D I just know I'm DEFINITELY continuing with the series and keeping my fingers crossed there won't be anymore monster-sex scenes XDXDXDXDXD PS: And for all monster-sex lovers, give this a try ehehehehhehhehehheheh [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more ***Re-read 10/7/15.

If you're looking for a fantasy involving props, chances are, it's not going to happen. Me : It's fine. That's not really my thing. (pause) Uh...I think I'll take the kidnapping special. With an order of dominant male. Preferably tall, dark, handsome, and pushy...you know the drill. The alpha type. Waitress : Big spender, aren't we? Anything else? (says sarcastically) Would you like fries with your order? Me : Yes, please. Can I get some gravy with that on the side? Brown, not white. Waitress : (appearing a bit confused) Whatever. It's your fetish. Me : Oh no. The fries aren't part of it. I'm just hungry. ..... Trigger warning : content borders on rapey (yes, it's a word, dammit) Eh, what can I say? A Hunger was a fun and fluffy read. There's no real substance here, but when comparing this to other pnr, it's on par with others that I've liked. Which is not bad, considering I've been on a serious adult pnr break lately after trying a few I didn't like. They're all starting to read the same and I've passed on most of the ones which haven't had more of an urban fantasy bent. Straight-up adult romance novels (in most every genre) have been pretty disappointing to me lately, so I've chosen not to go there. Until now. I saw a few friends talking about this one and figured I'd give it a shot. I find it funny that if this book were realistic fiction, I would rip it up one side and down the other for having such a horrible male lead. As in : NO ONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. The male lead is pushy, demanding, forceful, and about 20 other things which would have any female running for the hills in absolute horror. If some guy (or girl) pulled this act on me or anyone I know, I'd call the cops and have him (or her) locked up. But of course, I tend to cave a little for fantasy based books. What can I say? I have a thing for alpha men in pnr and historicals. Plus, this one had an ancient scottish brogue! Well, hellooooo highlander. Thank you for showing up in my kidnap story. At least, in this book, I get to give the double argument for his lack of decorum. 1. It's pnr. These aren't guys raised in polite society. They're driven by instinct that overwhelms them. Bad excuse? Sure. But hey, it's the basis for most pnr shifter stories. The devil made them do it, or some other nonsense. We laugh at it, we find it far-fetched, we'd hate it if any man in real life treated us like this, but darnit...it's fun to read about in books. 2. The dude is old. Like pre-dating historical bodice-ripping, non-con storylines, OLD. As in, \"he came from the dirt\" old. Historical fiction readers know that men from the past weren't as clued in to the equality of men and women. They always seem to need a woman to school them. And our heroine in this story did, in fact, school her man. Who I'd recommend this book to : People who don't mind aggressive alphas in their pnr and can forgive some serious bad behavior if the hero shows some sign of remorse or willingness to change later. Who I'd warn away from the book : Anyone who has a previous history of abuse, whether physical or sexual. The hero(?) did push the boundaries of sex and crossed some lines that he shouldn't have. The book danced that line of danger a little too close for comfort at times (view spoiler) [going down on someone in their sleep because you want to make them feel good is still against a person's will (and therefore wrong), even if it's not violent or scarring (in this instance) sexual experience....or making them take a shower with you, etc. It's still not okay. (hide spoiler) ] Anyone who rolls their eyes at old stereotypes of cavemen-type males. I'm warning you - you will hate this book. It's okay to steer clear. In fact, why are you even reading this review? You might want to go shower all of the gunk off now. Hurry! No, really. I don't blame anyone who would find this book distasteful. Only us fluff cravers are going to enjoy A Hunger . And enjoy, I did. ...more 2nd Reread Completed 8/1-8/9/13 Looking back at how much I loved this book when I first read it, and how much I loved it on reread, I can say most definitely that this book is an all-time keeper.

For me, this story is magic. I didn't have a lot of time to read it, but I actually didn't want to put it down when I couldn't read it. Finally, when I was able to dedicate some time to reading, I more or less read it straight through, except for when I was busy with my review books and Vacation Bible School. At the end of the night, I was excited to get into bed and curl up and revisit Lachlain and Emma's love story, reading late into the night. Lachlain Lachlain remains one of my fall time favorite paranormal heroes (and probably of all time). Although I refuse to pick a favorite Immortals After Dark hero, Lachlain makes some steep competition for the following heroes. He starts out a bully, but I can understand why. He literally was insane after being tortured for 150 years. However, it is a testament to his force of will that he didn't do worse to Emmaline, not to mention the power of their bond. Even though he wasn't super nice initially, his charisma was undeniable. As time passes and he realizes who Emma is and how she means to him, above and beyond being his fated mate, he shows just how adoring and capable of caring for his mate he can be. By the time Emma starts to love him, you can understand why. Cole makes you want a Lykae mate of your very own. Emmaline Sometimes the heroine doesn't click with me in a romance. But this is not one of those times. I loved Emma. I appreciated her journey of self-identity and coming into her own. She had that awkward feel of a woman on the cusp of maturity in her early twenties. Away from home for the first time, exploring who she is, and finding love. Considering the force of nature that Lachlain is, I think Emma held her own against him, and eventually, she had him eating out of her hand. I think <---A>Kresley Cole</---A> writes the best steamy romance out there. Blazingly hot, but not crossing the line into raunchy and distasteful (overshare) language that turns 'sexy' into 'gross' for this reader. Even on the reread, I was excited to see what happened next, and fanning myself with the incredible tension and fire between Emma and Lachlain. I wasn't a huge fan of vampire romance prior to reading this (this being one of the first I read at the time), but the scenes in which Lachlain feeds Emma show how powerful that is between a mated pair, and it's sexy, and not gross like I always thought it would be. I'm not saying I want to take blood or give my blood like in the book, but it's written well and beliveable in the context of the story. It's a very intimate thing, and you could see how it furthers the connection between them. On top of the fantastic romance, the world-building is complex and fascinating, and I love the camaraderie between the Valkyries and the other characters. You can see the Lore factions aligning before your eyes on the one way march to the Ascension. And though the developing romance is fascinating, it's also great to get glimpses into the past of the long-lived creatures of the Lore. There's a reason why Kresley Cole is in my top five authors of all time. She knows how to bring it. In the paranormal and historical romance genres, she kicks butt and takes names. You want to keep coming back for more of this wonderful world she has created. I'm glad I was able to revisit this fantastic book and I am jazzed to continue my 2013 reread of the Immortals After Dark series. Check out my Immortals After Dark Pinboard on Pinterest. ****Original Review Below********* I bought this book because I had read \"If You Dare,\" by this author and absolutely loved it. Well, lets just say, it made a steadfast fan of me. The Immortals After Dark is one of my all time favorite paranormal series, and part of the reason I'm so crazy about paranormals. Lachlain is kind of crazy, and who can blame him after being imprisioned horribly underground in a fiery pit, being drowned every day and consumed by fire for 150 years. One day he senses his mate, and he does something really painful and desperate to get free, to get to her. I was hooked. Lachlain is what I call a Sexy, Scottish, Werewolf. What a great combination. His one shortcoming is that he is kind of snobby towards Emmaline at first. He's dismayed that this true mate (Lykae only get one) is a Vampire. Although she's really a halfling, half-vampire, half-valkyrie. Emmaline is as timid as you can get. She's been protected and coddled by her valkyrie aunts her whole young life. She's about 70 years old, which is very young for a vampire and a valkyrie. Despite her penchant for very sexy, expensive lingerie, she's an innocent virgin. Imagine this crazed, beastly man tearing across a Paris courtyard, and dragging you off with him, and wanting to do things with you of a sexual nature? Very scary thought. This is how this book begins. Cole grabbed me as a reader and didn't let go. I wanted to find out how Lachlain would deal with the fact that his mate was not exactly what he wanted. Would he force her? Would she grow to love him and trust him? They go on a journey to get back to Lachlain's ancestral holdings in Scotland. He is the king of the Lycae and must go back to take his place as ruler of his people. Even though he isn't really happy with the mate that was chosen for him by fate, he's taking her with him. Lochlain has to get used to modern life. He finds he has expensive tastes, and charges up poor Emmaline's platinum card. He really makes the poor girl miserable. But she does manage to fall in love with him. She's not so sure about this Queen of the Lykae deal and having such a dominant mate, though. So it takes some serious wooing, Lykae-style, on Lachlain's part. And Lachlain discovers that having a vampire bride is a great thing, because being bitten by her is ecstasy. Plus, Emmaline is a sweet, loving woman who eases her way into his heart. This was a fabulous book. I was already werewolf-inclined after reading the MaryJanice Davidson story \"Love's Prisoner\", Bitten by Kelley Armstrong, and Night Play by Sherrilyn Kenyon, so it really got my attention. This is a spicy read with very hot love scenes, that don't overshadow the growing love between Lachlain and Emmaline. I enjoyed the whole dynamic of reluctant mates, and the crazy, alpha werewolf hero really appealed to me. I loved how Lachlain's feelings towards his bride changed so that he came to adore her and appreciate her. She became his life. I also loved how timid Emmaline comes into her own. She was drifting because she knew neither of her parents. She was afraid and disliked her vampire nature, and had to come to terms with who she is. She becomes quite the warrior queen. Ah, this is a classic for me. It comes highly recommended. Just a warning to readers. The first book in this series is the story in Playing Easy to Get, \"The Warlord Wants Forever.\" I read this one first and I was scratching my head trying to figure out who Nikolai and Myst were. You can read this first, but you might be a little lost when they bring up Nikolai and Myst as a forgone conclusion. ...more I DESPISE this kind of rape-glorifying bullshit!

At the time I tended to vent rather than explain. However I am more measured in my reviews now and want to clarify a couple of things: -I am not having a go at anyone who reads and enjoys these books as it is fiction and everyone has the right to enjoy their reading. So if you enjoy this kind of book I'm not trying to say there is something wrong with you! This is just my personal opinion on the plot. -I don't mean this as an attack on the actual author, just the subject matter being used. I'm not trying to say there is something wrong with the author for writing this plot. So there we are. If you like the author and the plot, please continue to do so and just ignore my venting!*** ...more This book had a slow start, but finished with a bang! spoilers Lachlain was crazy out of his mind from years and years of being burned alive and tortured by a vampire horde so for about 1/4 of the book he was a asshat... but as his mind starts to heal and he starts to get to know Emma he feels guilt over the way he has treated her and starts trying to win her love and trust.

The Beauty and the beast plot works so well with the dark tone of the story. While Emma is definitely Belle, I dare not say that Lachlain is the Beast for his actions that aren't heroic or highly appreciated at all. He tortures her, even when I saw her consent to his deeds, he still treats her as if she is at his disposal. But Kresley Cole could redeem her book with the second half it. The developments of both Emma and Lachlain are visible there. Emma is so shy when I started reading this book, but in the end, she is brave and kickass and independent. Lachlain, too, he tries to be a better person and makes amends for what he's done. He has made mistakes and he wants to right it, that's exactly what he should do. \u201cNix had told Emma before she'd left for Europe that on this trip she would 'do that which you were born to do.'

I actually find it quite surprising that I didn't abandon the book after the first few chapters featured numerous attempted rape scenes, a control freak of a man (or male, at least) whose violent tendencies are not only portrayed as acceptable, but highly desirable. But, though I was immediately horrified, the book also somehow managed to hold my attention and the writing style, a strange interest in the plot, and a morbid fascination in this destructive relationship forced me to read on. I'm not at all in favour of this kind of unhealthy relationship where the guy relentlessly pursues a woman, scares her into submission, and attempts to rape her so many times that she eventually decides he's kinda hot. I do not find this an appealing romance story. If it was a cautionary tale of abusive relationships... well, then sure! But Kresley Cole seems to celebrate the controlling personality of Lachlain and I find it rather disturbing to see how highly rated this book is. Apparently, he's so \"gorgeous\" and \"sexy\" and \"protective\" and these traits all make up for the fact that he repeatedly sexually assaults Emma, refuses to let her return to her family, demands that she sleep in the same bed as him (to her obvious discomfort as her kind are known for preferring to sleep on the floor), and even picks out the clothes she wears. He picks out the clothes she wears . This is not a romance, it's the story of one person completely taking over the life of another, refusing to let them make any decisions for themselves and calling it love. Can someone actually let me know why so many rate this book highly? It's not much of an urban fantasy because there's just a random array of creatures that hate each other and no great mythological story going on... and it certainly doesn't work as a romance. Or do I not understand the idea of romance and love? Yeah, I'm 19, perhaps it's me who doesn't get it... but I thought it was about caring, compassion and mutual respect . I honestly want to understand why I read this book and saw abuse when thousands have read this and seen love and sexiness. And yes, there were some attempts to redeem Lachlain... he began to understand that he had treated Emma badly and felt very guilty that he had nearly strangled her to death... aww, poor Lachlain... *rolls eyes* Whatever happened later, I never supported their violent relationship; plus, even though Lachlain experienced some minor guilt for the attempted rapes/choking, it didn't affect him enough to let Emma make any decisions for herself... nope, she must stay with him and she must sleep with him, but this time she must like it too! Good god. It was painful to read. Why not 1 star? There were good bits amongst the annoying. I quite liked the scenes where they just talked in the car and he began to learn about the 21st century after being locked up for a couple hundred years; his reaction to the plastic card that has unlimited possibilities was funny, so was his repetitive opening and closing of the sun roof. But there was more of what I don't want to read than what I do want to. I can't and won't wrap my head around the idea of a guy finding his one true mate and treating her in such a cruel, violent and often openly humiliating way. There were times when he obviously enjoyed her discomfort and it infuriated me. For me, love isn't about being selfish and controlling; and for that reason, I won't be reading any more of this series. ...more \"Vampires, Valkyrie, and Lykae, oh my.

How she keeps the multiple story lines in hand is really fascinating. Lachlain and Emma are bonded together by blood, fate and instincts. Lachlain is infuriated by the fact that Emma is partly a vampire, but as the story progresses, he suddenly catches himself forgetting about it. \"He would use this against her, he thought hazily. If his blood on her tongue made her lose control like this, he would force her to drink him until she surrendered everything... Force a vampire to drink him\u2026what was happening to him?\" Lachlain\u2019s desire for Emma is so strong that it helps him to stay sane after being tortured for 150 years. He is possessive and arrogant, but sometimes has really tender moments: When he watched her sleeping, he often thought, My heart lies vulnerable outside my chest. Emma is a very young immortal. She is only seventy, overprotected by her Valkyrie aunts, delicate, shy and insecure. But she has hidden assets. There is a beast not only in Lachlain, but in Emma as well. Her real strength breaks surface by drinking from Lachlain. His blood, memories, instincts are catalysts for her alteration. The gentle, fearful Emma becomes a strong, confident, wily warrior.

The author's excuse? \"She's secretive\" & \"she wants to protect her family.\" From what I don't know b'c they happen to be lethal - it's just all a series of excessively dumb assumptions.

Lachlain MacRieve is the Lykae King This is the first full-length story in the Immortals After Dark series, following the novella The Warlord Wants Forever that introduced the Lore , the mythical strata created by Kresley Cole \"where those sentient creatures that are not human live\". You don\u2019t have to read that short story to understand A Hunger Like No Other , but I did and I think it helps to get a better grasp of the overall scenario as some events in the two stories take place at the same time. Lachlain MacRieve is the Lykae King, a 1,200-year-old werewolf who\u2019s been searching for his mate for a long, long time. For the past 150 years, he\u2019s been imprisoned in the catacombs beneath Paris, where he\u2019s been tortured by the Vampire Horde and subjected to die from the fires of hell only to be resurrected by his immortality - over and over again. The only thing that keeps him alive and somewhat sane is the thought of finding his mate, so when he unexpectedly scents her nearby one night, he finds the strength to break free from the bonds that keep him captive. When he finally escapes the catacombs and finds his way to the surface, then into a darkened alley, his mate is gone. He\u2019s not defeated, though, because once a Lykae scents his mate, she\u2019s his forever \u2013 and he will find her again\u2026 However, Lachlain has the shock of his life when he catches up with her one week later and discovers she\u2019s, gasp!, a vampire. No, this cannot be! Lykaes and vampires are mortal enemies, so why would fate give him a vampire as a mate? Emmaline \u201cEmma\u201d Troy is actually half vampire and half Valkyrie. Her mother Helen (of Troy?) was a Valkyrie who died when Emma was still a baby. As for her father, all Emma knows is that he is/was a vampire. Determined to finally find out his identity, Emma\u2019s left the Valkyrie coven in New Orleans for the first time in her 70 years \u2013 wow, she\u2019s almost a newborn compared to Lachlain! \u2013 and flies to Paris, where her parents are believed to have met and lived together for a while. Imagine her surprise when, one night, she\u2019s kidnapped by a strange non-human male who seems to be a bit \"deranged\", to say the least. Lachlain is torn between lust and disgust. His \"beast\" wants to claim Emma as his mate, but he\u2019s having a hard time reconciling the fact that she\u2019s a vampire. He ends up \"convincing\" her to travel with him to his home in Scotland, with the promise that he\u2019ll let her go when they get there. He\u2019s lying through his teeth, of course, as he has no intention of letting her go \u2013 ever! He\u2019s only buying time, before she accepts her position as his mate. But there are people after her \u2013 not only her Valkyrie foster mother and aunts, but some bad vampires too \u2013 and Lachlain has to fight all of them to keep Emma safe. Not an easy task, when he has to woo her and convince her she belongs with him at the same time. When I read the Prologue, I thought Lachlain would end up being one of my favorite heroes. I was sure he would be a dark, brooding and intense hero \u2013 come on, he severed one of his leg to free it from its bonds to get to his mate! \u2013 but that was not to be. He had a brief bout of \"insanity\" in the beginning, which was completely expected considering his 150-year imprisonment, but he recovered from it quite easily and I found it too unbelievable. Strangely enough, I wasn\u2019t put off by his lying to Emma. I\u2019m usually not a fan of deceitful heroes, but I was OK with Lachlain\u2019s lying because it was consistent with his initial \"madness\". He kept lying later, when he was \"sane\" again, but that was another story... As for Emma, she got on my nerves. She started out as a wuss \u2013 by her own words \u2013 and ended up as a strong and independent vampire/Valkyrie \u2013 kudos to her! \u2013 but the journey in between was uneven. I guess she was supposed to be funny and witty, but I found myself wanting to shake some sense into her a couple of times. Some of her conversations with her crazy Valkyrie aunts were hilarious, but I got tired of their antics after a while. There\u2019s a time to joke around, and there\u2019s a time to get down to business. JMHO. I could have \"ignored\" Lachlan\u2019s and Emma\u2019s shortcomings if the plot had been engaging enough but, alas, that wasn\u2019t the case. Some jarring inconsistencies kept pestering me while I was reading this book, and I just couldn\u2019t get over them. A) Lachlain\u2019s escape from the catacombs wasn\u2019t as difficult as it should have been. I mean, not a single guard intercepted his way! B) Why did Lachlain waited 150 years to escape? Don\u2019t tell me that he only felt compelled to do it when he scented Emma, because I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t find ending his torture as soon as possible compelling enough. C) Why didn\u2019t the Vampire Horde go after Lachlain when he escaped? He couldn\u2019t be that \"insignificant\", could he? D) Why did Demestriu, the Vampire King, \u2026 Okay, I\u2019ll stop ranting now because I\u2019m about to enter into spoiler territory. All things considered, this was a fun read but, as it happened with The Warlord Wants Forever , I wasn\u2019t wowed by the story. I\u2019m feeling kind of weird here, because many readers love this series and I just don\u2019t get it. I do love the idea of having all kinds of non-human beings living together \u2013 mostly at war but some in peace \u2013 in the same universe, the Lore , but that\u2019s all. Ms. Cole\u2019s writing was humorous and easy to read, the love scenes were hot and the story was fast paced and entertaining despite its inconsistencies, but I\u2019m still unsure about this series. Does it get better? Should I give the next book a try? Decisions, decisions\u2026 ...more I am going to keep this short and sweet because I am eager to get back to 'KC-land'!!

For that reason, I recommend reading The Warlord Wants Forever first, even though it's a more of a short story than a full installment. In A Hunger Like No Other , we meet Emmaline Troy, a Valkyrie/vampire hybrid, and Lachlain MacRieve, King of the Lykae. Emma is in Paris looking for information about her father. Her Valkyrie mother died of HEARTBREAK shortly after Emma was born, never revealing to anyone who the father of her child was. All anyone knew was that she had been in Paris with him until she returned to her coven in New Orleans with baby Emma in tow. SO. Off to Paris Emma goes. After spending a semester there taking night classes and researching, Emma has nothing to show for her time abroad except disappointment. She is about to be recalled home to Louisiana where she can be kept safe from some vague threat when she is attacked by a very large, very hot, very ANGRY man. Lachlain MacRieve has been held captive and tortured for over 150 years. The vampires have made the catacombs under Paris their very own personal prison where they subject their enemies to unbelievable cruelty. For Lachlain that means being chained in front of a roaring fire that waxes and wans, burning him over and over again, but never killing him b/c he is IMMORTAL. He simply burns until he passes out, only to reawaken when his body has adequately healed him only to endure more torture. Until her smells her , his mate . The woman he has been looking for for nearly a millennia . *rolls eyes* I'm wracking my brain trying to come up with a way to make all of this sound less ridiculous, but I can't. Maybe it is ridiculous and I just don't care b/c I love this series. Despite that love, I think this is my least favorite IAD book. The Emmaline at the beginning of book is vastly different from the kickass Emma at end of the book, but end-of-book Emma can't entirely make up for the spineless ninny that is early Emma. And Emma's little epiphany moment is both confusing, and once you figure out where she's going with it, hard to accept. She seems to mark, with pin-point accuracy, the pivotal moment that turned her into a big fraidy-cat, and this \"aha\" only served to make me have a, \"sure . . . whatever you say, boss\" moment of my own. But, like I already said, by the end, Emma is straight-up kickass. Kicking lycae ass, kickass. And this happens slowly and incrementally enough that it's believable. Lachlain, on the other hand, is a RAGE monster pretty much from beginning to end. And I know that I said in my The Warlord Wants Forever review that I am totally down with intensely sexually aggressive males, but Lachlain is a little bit OTT, even for me. His early interactions with Emma skate that fine line between aggressively hot and aggressively-bound-for-prison so closely that it's uncomfortable. Especially taking into consideration that early Emma was a spineless ninny. If she wasn't, and she gave as good as she got, then it probably would have worked for me, but as it was . . . Emma's fine line between arousal and terror . . . not a big fan. But I do love this series, and once RAGE monster Lachlain starts controlling himself a bit better, and Emma grows a backbone, I remembered why. There is, however, no denying that the early stages of their \"courtship\" were rough. If you have a problem with that sort of thing, I'd skip this one, but if you're more of a \"the end justifies the means\"person, you should be fine. The uncomfortable part is fairly brief, and the rest of it is typical Cole awesomeness. Your call. But don't let one scary RAGE monster scare you off the whole series, b/c then you would be missing out.

Ok, that\u2019s not entirely accurate, werewolves are but the two go hand-in-hand, and this audiobook has both AND toe curling hooks ups, so really A HUNGER LIKE NO OTHER was win / win / WIN! You know an author is truly adept when she manages to take two elements that rank fairly low on your list of awesome, and makes you love them. I strongly dislike immortal virgin heroines because honestly, how can one live for centuries and NEVER get it on? Granted, Emmaline hasn\u2019t hit the 100 year mark, however Cole spun her innocence in such a way that even I was completely sold. And secondly, Valkyries have become more common in Paranormal than vampires and the female protagonist just so happens to be a mix of the two, and yet I couldn\u2019t have cared less because her character was so well developed that I saw her as a person rather than just the sum on her preternatural parts. Lachlain was barbaric, offensive, and presumptuous; he whisked unwitting little Emma away to his Scottish castle, tried to force himself on her, and strong-arm her into becoming his werewolf queen\u2014I loved it! The chemistry between them was downright savage. MacRieve hates himself for being unable to resist his mortal enemy, Troy is repulsed by his Lykae nature, and yet they are inexplicably drawn to each other like moths to a flame. Their relationship and the mind blowing romp that followed were indeed show stoppers, however the praiseworthy world-building surrounding the Lore wasn\u2019t too far behind. The plot wasn\u2019t exactly cutting-edge, but enough secondary threads were brought in to keep IMMORTALS AFTER DARK going for a good long while. As much as I enjoy Cole\u2019s writing style, it was Robert Petkoff\u2019s come-hither brogue that made thirteen+ IAD installments seem like a walk in the park. Yes, the number of pages involved is intimidating, but when you convert them into hours upon hours of listening ecstasy, the only conceivable answer becomes \u201cWhere do I sign-up?\u201d His female voices were surprisingly genuine, and there\u2019s no denying the sex appeal of his Scottish accents. Lachlain as a character was\u2026 abrasive, however Petkoff\u2019s rendition made him ridiculously irresistible. Now I finally understand why all of my reviewer peers are fawning over this narrator; he truly is in a league all of his own. A HUNGER LIKE NO OTHER made me want to give real life the middle finger, and get drunk on IAD until I overdosed. ~4.5 stars ...more Love this book.

As much as I liked this action packed, intriguing, humorous, and highly sensual story filled with mostly\u00a0likable characters, there were a few plot inconsistencies that bothered me. For instance, the Horde captures, imprisons, and\u00a0tortures Lachlain, the hero, only to have him eventually escape decades later, then never bother to pursue him or even give him an afterthought.\u00a0That does not make sense!\u00a0Then we have the heroine, Emma, whom everyone considers meek, timid, and in constant need of protection. Yet, her Valkyrie coven allows her to travel alone and unprotected to Paris in search of information about her deceased mother and her unknown vampire father, though vampires are the Valkyries'\u00a0known enemy. I will also admit to being a little annoyed with the slow developing progress of the relationship between the hero and heroine and their constant bickering; however, I also understand that the author used their relationship as a tool to flesh out her world\u00a0in this first full-lenght book of the series. Knowing that allowed\u00a0me to get past my annoyance and to enjoy their relationship for what it was.

The author implies at some point that his treatment of her is justified because Lachlain hates vampires, but I never got the feeling he was reacting to Emma as a vampire. (Not least of which because even he keeps forgetting she\u2019s a vampire because she doesn\u2019t act *anything* like a vampire.) And hatred for someone\u2019s race isn\u2019t a good enough reason for behaving badly anyway. Basically for the first half of the book Lachlain acts like Emma\u2019s his sex toy or possession (*his* mate to do with as *he* wishes) rather a person who might have thoughts or feelings of her own. The second half of the book, after one of Emma\u2019s aunts threatens him, he suddenly starts acting a little better. (More of just your typical macho-alpha jerk behavior. But his behavioral change didn\u2019t seem to be accompanied by any deep or meaningful character change and he didn\u2019t really express remorse for his behavior.) Characterization: Stinks. Emma\u2019s aunts are rather funny and zany, but very one-dimensional. The other Lykae are very stereotypical types, and so are the bad guys. Emma\u2019s the only half-way original character and we don\u2019t get nearly enough insight into her. ...more Apparently this series is all about the women being bullied into submission by the \"hero\" of the story.

Another friend who disliked the book described it this way, \"He practically rapes her, he threatens her life, he molests her, he forces her to perform sexual acts on him against her will, kidnaps her, steals her credit card and decks himself out like James Bond, trashes every hotel room rented under HER name, then holds her hostage in his castle....but she falls for him within a week! There is hope for sexual predators everywhere. Just growl that you're meant to be together, and every felonies you've committed just fades away. I can't wait for the wedding day film reel...so romantic.\" Jenn ( see full review ) I'll admit I have a problem with this violent alpha male thing treating women like trash, even when the woman is smart and strong and doesn't let it affect her self-esteem. For example, I love the Mercy Thompson series except I just can't stand her tolerance for how the men treat her. I finally had to stop reading them. But the reviewer mentioned in the first paragraph above actually really likes that series so she isn't nearly as sensitive to this stuff as I am. And she still hated both the first and second (as did several people who agreed with her review.) If you're interested in why I have such a problem with Mercy Thompson, here's an extract from my review of the second: \"This is the annoying Heinlein-esque sexism: you know the guy is a jerk and you know better but let's just humor him. The reality is that in by going along with him with his macho bullshit, he still gets all the power and control. Just because you're going along voluntarily doesn't make it equality.\" This book sounds way, way worse. (Although I hear that later in that series it's really not so very different.) BUT This powerful, on the verge of violence, were-creature thing can be done right. The one example I'm familiar with is Ilona Andrews 's series beginning with Magic Bites has an alpha were who is strong and scary and wants the heroine. While she thinks he's physically attractive, she refers to him as a psychopath and feels herself lucky when she leaves his presence with no bloodshed. They end pretty much every encounter in a fight because he's controlling. But although all werea are potentially very violent, alphas are both male and female. He of course is King of all of them because this is, after all, fantasy fiction. But the main character refuses to submit to his ways and makes him adjust to her ways as much as she can. She is also incredible strong and amazing with her sword and a fight would probably be almost an even match between the two. And he is still very much a sexy, powerful, leading man who allegedly hates it when she doesn't listen because everyone else does. And you still very much want them to be together because they are true equals. I know it really isn't the same genre, it's not a romance series so the romance is spread throughout several books before culmination but the idea is that women don't have to be whipped into submission to be with a powerful man. So that's a long review for a book I haven't read but I've felt the need to vent this for a long time and this was a good place to do so. ...more First full length novel in Cole's paranormal romance series Immortals After Dark, (second overall), A Hunger Like No Other is a gold mine of uber-alpha, destined-for-each other, sexy reading.

When Lachlain scents his mate while hidden below the streets of Paris, he does the impossible- he breaks the chains that have kept him imprisoned for 150 years and goes after her. Sure he tears off a limb to do so, but he's a werewolf- so regeneration, though painful, is possible. Emmaline has lived as an accepted outsider with her Valkyrie Aunts all her life. Half Vampire, half Valkyrie, Emma is the non-confrontational one of the bunch ... but that's about to change. Storming into her life with the force of a hurricane, Lachlain is disgusted when he discovers the woman he's waited for, for almost a thousand years, is a vampire- the hated enemy of his clan. None-the-less he takes her hostage, deciding he'll keep her because there's no way he's losing his mate now that he's found her. Weakened by not feeding for days, Emma is lethargic and scared out of her mind by the overbearing were who's hijacked her and talked her into joining him on his return trip home to Scotland. But when she takes his blood for the first time, her strength returns full force and the creature known as Emma the Timid takes a drastic turn. Even as Lachlain's \"beast\" is soothed by finally being with his mate, Emma finds she is not so timid after all and so she does whatever she can to get away from the impossible man who claims he wants her above all others. In the meantime, she's having strange dreams from Lachlain's point of view and as they spend time together, finds herself just as drawn to him as he is to her. So much so, when she does find her chance to escape- instead of running home- she heads straight for the deadly vampire who ruined Lachlain's life. Sacrificing her own desires, she finds the courage to kill a king ... and in process accept her fate as a creature of Three. Archetypal Paranormal Romance, AHLNO is a thrilling ride I couldn't get off of till the very last word! Here's the thing though, Cole's writes some over the top alpha heroes. Not usually a problem for me because I find non-alpha heroes in romantic fiction never hold my interest very long. However, she writes them SO alpha, I often cringe at their antics, which tend to come off as bullying. Just as when I read If You Dare, 1st in a historical romance series by this author, I wasn't sure if I would ever like the hero ... until about a quarter of the way through when he began to change. And too, the heroine irritated the heck out of me for being so unrelentingly angry at the hero through much of the rest of book! Yet through it all, I closed the book thinking, \"that was a good read.\" I suppose the setting, the fantasy-like creatures, and yes, the strong romantic elements is enough to make it a winner in the long run. Either way, I'm certainly rushing out to get the rest in the series! :) ...more I have to confess that Emmaline Troy is one of my favorite heroines in a paranormal romance.

I had read all of Kresley Cole's books. That is another reason this is on my 'all-time-favorites' bookshelf. It was the one that opened me up to the genre. ...more Well, this was my second book by Kresley Cole. I was slightly hesitant to pick it up, considering I wasn't much impressed with 'The Warlord Wants Forever'. But somehow, it turned out better than I thought it would.

But unfortunately, they have both been lying there on the shelf and just collecting dust (and guilt in me). It was time to try something else; To listening to the audiobook instead. ~ I also read a lot of good reviews about the narrator Robert Petkoff ... \u201cNow, undress for me and let me see what\u2019s mine.\u201d ...oh yeah, these alpha wolwes has it in them And... Was it a good one? Absolutely, I liked this and there will be more books or audio books in this series to come for me. *********************************************** This grand love-story starts when Lachlain, a prisoner since over hundreds years , chained by cruel vampires deep in the burning hell in the old Paris Catacombs , hear and feel, that his chosen MATE at last is nearby up there on the streets of Paris. With all the strength he can persuade, he manages to break free and flee up to the ground to a contemporary city to search for his chosen bride. # Lachlain MacRieve, leader of the Lykae Clan , is enraged to find the predestined mate he's waited millennia for is a vampire. Or partly one. # Emmaline is a small, ethereal half Valkyrie/half vampire , who somehow begins to soothe the fury burning within him. \u2018She'd made him watch every Alien movie. Most of the goriest scenes were accompanied by his dialogue: \u201cAch, that's no' - that's just no' right.... Bloody hell, this canna be right.\u201d Everything is new and strange, cars, phones, TVs, computers etc \u2014 and judge of the old werewolf's surprise when the woman he has has been waiting for so long turns out to be a beautiful, small, pretty, red-blond ... vampire . A woman of the same hated kind as his number one enemy. It starts with easier cuddling-combats, funny banters, persuasion , denial and funny incidents. It continues with strong desire and heat, a trip to the old werewolv's castle in Scottland and ends of course with magnificent deep love. \u2018Her heart sank. That's why he found her attractive- because he'd been so long without. He'd probably find a perfumed rock appealing at this point.\u2019 *********************************************** A Hunger Like No Other , a PNR m/f, and kind of real series start, from 2006 with more than 35.000 raitings here (average 4.21). That's impressive - can't be that wrong. ~ It was a new good series for me. I need some time with werewolves, vampires and a smutastic wild paranormal world now and then. These books are maybe not for everyone but I like this bloody paranormal love tale . It is perhaps a little pretentious and very melodramatic, but so much fun too. A vampire captured by her wildest fantasy.... Blood flows and these different species kills and chasing each other like mad savages. It is a crazy wonderful feeling to be in this world with ancient vampires, werewolves and beautiful cruel Valkyrie women. ..and some steaming hot stuff with huge needs of course. A series to keep to.

What a horrible message to send out to little girls and boys but there you have it, I'll be there opening night when the live action movie comes out. A Hunger Like No Other, yeah, it's pretty much Beauty and the Beast, sexified. Sure, there's a whole Lore world with valkyries, wraiths, ghouls, demons, and of course, our vampires and werewolves but that whole world is a bit messily relayed. It seems the Accession is about to go down and that means all our paranormal factions are gearing up to fight with the goal to become the #1 paranormal group. A whole slew of characters are introduced and glancing at the Long series page, they're all going to get their own stories. Emma is our vampire but also slash valykrie and Lachlain is our werewolf. Lachlain was chained and burned (werewolves are immortal so he could heal himself) for 150 yrs but when he scents his mate (Emma!) he breaks free, our fierce Beast. Emma is fairly young (only 70yrs to Lachlains 1200) and has been incredibly sheltered, so she's our uber innocent Beauty. Emma is annoying with her brattiness and Lachlain is severely side-eye inducing with his controlling and lying but there was something compelling about their relationship. The writing is good, if a little immature and the world building definitely needs to be organized and flushed out more, but as this is first in the series, I have hopes the author will mature and gain her stride. Whether it was the Beauty and the Beast feel to it or the writing/story itself, I couldn't make myself stop reading and I plan on reading the rest in the series. So, I looked ahead to see the next books in the series and the next three would work for Bingo squares, I may just ride and die with this series for a while, lol. I'm getting flashbacks to when I devoured the first 5 books in the Fever series. ...more Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting much, but it's more likely because the previous couple of books in this genre that I read - Be Still My Vampire Heart and Guilty Pleasures - were unremarkable and boring, in that order, that I enjoyed this so much. See, low expectations :) Lachlain is king of the Lykae and after spending 150 years of imprisonment and torture beneath the streets of Paris breaks free when he smells the scent of the woman he's been waiting all his life for.

See, low expectations :) Lachlain is king of the Lykae and after spending 150 years of imprisonment and torture beneath the streets of Paris breaks free when he smells the scent of the woman he's been waiting all his life for. Almost completely mad, he is horrified to find she's a vampire - a parasite, in his book. Emmaline is actually half-vampire, half Valkyrie, and has had a very sheltered life. In Paris to discover who her vampire father was, she is overwhelmed and frightened by the monster-man who won't let her out of his sight. And on top of that, she's being hunted by vampires and vampire demons. This is not a new paranormal romance plotline, but I love what Cole did with it. The beginning reminded me a bit of Jacques in Dark Desire , but Lachlain is so much more appealing and sympathetic. I mean, I felt for him. The car trip reminded me a bit of The Bourne Identity , but is quite fun. I loved the growing relationship between the two, and how they changed, grew, matured and adapted. Lachlain is dominating and possessive, but makes far more of an effort than any Carpathian in Feehan's books to meet Emma halfway and be less overbearing. He's not smothering, which I like, but is rather very considerate by the end. I thought Emma was going to drive me nuts but she didn't, and I didn't see the ending coming at all - I hate it when a book is so obvious I can predict without wanting or trying to. It's well written, a similar style and tone to Kathy Love, and the pacing is spot-on. Cole separated perspectives clearly, which I appreciate: it gives you a breather from one character's thoughts and get to see what else is going on without getting confused (something I hate about Feehan's books). A Hunger Like No Other has great passion and a wonderful mix of fantastic creatures and races and history. Will definitely read more of Cole's books! ...more After I gave up trying to understand all the confusing terminology, i.e.--Horde, Lore, Valkyries, Lykae, Furiae, Forbearers,etc.-- and concentrated on the love story between the hero Lachlain and heroine Emmaline, I was able to enjoy this rather hot and often humorous story. It was not a particularly fast paced read for me, and I suspect that may in part be because of the distracting Scottish accent the hero's dialogue is written in. Half the time I said to myself 'what did he just say?'.

Half the time I said to myself 'what did he just say?'. I also gave up trying to keep all the various valkyrie \"aunts\" straight in my head--there were a bit too many characters to focus on. But since this is the first full-length novel in the series, I assume a lot of that is needed to set the stage. I did like the hero and heroine; I thought Lachlain desire for Emma was kind of hot, and while Emma's timidness got on my nerves at times, I liked her more and more as the story developed. The last 100 pages did move much more quickly for me, and I did enjoy the ending very much (loved Emma's bravery). All in all, not a bad read--I'm hoping the other books in the series are a little less confusing, and still have a humorous edge to them! ...more I hate this book more than I've hated any other book in a long time. At first I really liked the idea of a vampire character who is so gentle she refuses to fight or kill or drink from a live being. But then it turns out that not only is her Valkyrie family embarrassed she's a pacifist, they mercilessly make fun of her for it. But wait, they also tell her that she's not allowed to bite a human, because she might kill them. So, it's OK to kill in epic battle, but not for food?

Apparently, Emmeline eventually get her I-am-Vampire/Valkyrie-hear-me-have-a-15-page-fight-scene on, but I wouldn't know, since I only read the first 40-or-so pages. But here's the real reason I only read that far: I'm not really into romances that stem from attempted rape. In one of the more chilling encounters I've read, our heroine meets her \"mate\" when he's one a destructive rampage through Paris, looking for her. He finds her, rips her blouse and bra open to ogle her on a public street, and forcibly makes her take him back to her hotel. Once there, he kisses her, uttering such charming phrases as, \"Kiss me back, witch, while I decide if I should spare your life,\" and \"Kiss me like your life depends upon it.\" Then he makes her take a shower with him, during the duration of which he manhandles her, forces her to spread her legs and is about to rape her, which she only manages to circumnavigate by giving him a hand-job. And then he steals her credit card to buy himself a new wardrobe. (Note: if you look really menacing, concierges at fancy Parisian hotels will let you use an AmEx Black card with a woman's name on it, even if you are a man who has been trapped at the gates of hell for a thousand years.) And then he performs oral sex on her while she sleeps. Did I mention that she's a 70-year-old virgin who's never even had a kiss? But I guess the almighty mating bond (a trope I am so very tired of seeing) really does conquer all. Except my gag reflex. ...more The good: At about the midway point, the book started picking up and turned into a pretty quick read. The smut scenes were steamy and practically lit the pages on fire! It gave TONS of lead-in's for additional books...to a fault.

There is hope for sexual predators everywhere. Just growl that you're meant to be together, and every felony you've committed just fades away. I can't wait for the wedding day film reel...so romantic. The author introduced us to so many secondary characters that I felt like starting some notes. It's probably not a good sign when you read a new name and think \"Now who the f*#@ is THIS?!\". And for all of the characters introduced, you were lucky to find out their job title. Too many people, not enough information. Yeah, yeah, he's got a Scottish accent. We get it. We REALLY don't need the constant \"I didda no' ken tha'\" nonsense. It was distracting, and I spent more time trying to figure out what the heck he was talking about. ...more 3.75 This thing has been reviewed a bajillion times so I'm just mostly making notes to myself.
