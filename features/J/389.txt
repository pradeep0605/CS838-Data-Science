{"Comments": "This is one of the better book out of the series. I mean come on!

As usual book and events begins in a complicated range, so many places and so many people. It only gave clearing when it reached the end.

Like in the one As they went on the clue hunt, the next stop was Sydney, Australia, but not Australia. It was just for misdirection. As usual book and events begins in a complicated range, so many places and so many people. It only gave clearing when it reached the end. Yet some parts needed still explanation unlike the previous books. Also some parts made me totally confused. Thinking of Nellie, and also their dad's cousin Shep, I thought All of them, with Amy and Dan, would end up as a family. Like in the one of the previous books mentioned, I thought Nellie was the only one to whom they could trust. However, she turn out to be a secret person, or Madrigal, or someone who wants to stop them. On the other hand, somehow I remembered Alastair, and thought he stopped the chase. At the last chapter it they found him at their destination, with and Ekat stronghold, and stole \"the poem\" from their parents and caused their death long ago. Simply put, Everything turns into a mess. This chase requires two things: find clues and trust no one. ...more Amy was better in this book. A lot stronger I think. (spoiler) <---A>Jude Watson</---A> I hate you for killing off Irina. She was always my favorite villain of this novel. And to make her death so damn heroic. (end of spoiler) But this is one of the few 39 clues book in which I actually got what was happening. A few books in the series were not capable of giving me that.I found this book quite satisfying. I like the 39 Clues \u201c<+++>In Too Deep</+++>\u201d by Jude Watson because of the new characters they introduce and all the intense situation in each book. This is number six in the series. Dan and Amy competition is getting bigger and harder to beat.

Amy and Dan are traveling under false Australian passports. They have to meet ground transport when they land in Moscow, Russia. But they wander through the airport to see if anyone is following them. Natalie and Ian check into observatory hotel so they can spy on them. Dan and Amy opponents in the competition think a 11 and 14 year old ruling the world was a little ridiculous.They don\u2019t want Amy and Dan to win. Dan and Amy find a clue carved in stone on a rock. They also remember that Grace\u2019s lawyer Mr.McIntyre said, \u201cnever trust anybody in this competition only trust yourselves\u201d. They are finding this true. This book 39 Clues \u201cIn Too Deep\u201d takes place in modern day Russia. Where Dan and Amy find three clues that will lead them to their next country. All of these books take you to different countries. It is interesting to hear about different cultures. The theme for \"In Too Deep,\" is for every problem there is a solution. You can always find answers to most problems in life. Dan and Amy did this by using their resources for solving all their troubles. They couldn't just count on other people. They had to use things they had with them and it worked out pretty well. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes adventures. Also if you like series books. These books have people that get into dangerous situations which keep you hanging on. They are great for seventh grade and up. They are short stories but good. ...more I'm going to give a generic review of the series. Basically because I'm lazy and don't want to write 39 reviews. Okay, 11. We finally read Book 1.

I thought the premise of this book very interesting. I loved how they integrated history and geography along with problem-solving skills and code cracking. Add in the action, humor and intrigue and kids (and some adults) can't put them down. All three of us that have read 39 Clues thought Book 2 the weakest of the series. But as one son said, after finishing the series, \"Gordon Korman seems to be getting better. I think he's a decent author now.\" Some of the books are better at teaching the history part, others just barely skim the surface and you don't really learn about the person they're 'highlighting'. I appreciate that they're clean books - no curse words or you-know-what going on. There is some violence (very little, if any, blood) and several murder attempts, but they never work. The series would most likely be called twaddle by my Charlotte Mason friends. I do, however, think it has more redeeming qualities than most kids literature and I'm happy to see my boys devouring a book every day or so. ...more Wow. Wowowowowowowowowow. What is up with these authors enjoying torturing me?! Lemme take some deep breaths...I can't believe what Jude Watson did in this one. Seriously. SERIOUSLY?! I think this one, out of the previous ones, was the best written. It's between this one and the first one by Rick Riordan. Both of them delved into the emotional parts of the narrative as well as giving you a grand picture of just how dangerous this clue hunt really is in the story. Isabel \"Cobra\" is evil.

I don't think I can even talk about her anymore. (view spoiler) [WHY DID SHE HAVE TO DIE?! WHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYYYYYYYYYYY?! (hide spoiler) ] Okay...I'mma just go cool it, maybe start the next book. But first, I'll probably be doing this: How could a \"kiddie\" series make you have so many feels? How could I get so attached to who I thought was an enemy, and was until the end?

(Although, when I was a teen, I was all about the Fearless series by Francine Pascal. But I quit that around book seven or eight.) Appetizer: In Too Deep doesn't start out too deep...or rather, a better term would be \"too tense.\" Amy, Dan and their au pair, Nellie have arrived in Sydney, Australia, not on the hunt for one of the 39 clues but on the hunt for connections to their parents, who the siblings have learned travelled to Australia before their deaths. Of course, as Amy and Dan reconnect with their father's old best friend, the extended Cahill family won't leave them in peace (and this includes the unexpected appearance of a new Kabra, who'd previously stuck to the sidelines). So, I absolutely love the contrast between the cover image, the book title and the opening paragraph! The book begins: \"The sound of rushing water filled Amy Cahill's ears.\" Right there. I knew she was in a plane descending to the bottom of a lake or an ocean! Oh the dramas! But then, the story continues: \"If she kept her eyes closed, she could imagine she was standing under a beautiful tropical waterfall. Unfortunately, she was hiding in an airport bathroom\" (p. 1). Oh, Jude Watson and the cover designers, you had me going there. I think I implied it previously, when I reviewed Beyond the Grave, the fourth book in the series, but thus far Ms. Watson is my favorite among the 39 Clues writers. In this book, I couldn't help but notice how well she integrates some of the previous Cahill adventures into her story. (I appreciated this because all of the books are running together. And since I can't keep up with the series, there's no way I could possibly find the time to go back and RE-read). I did have a little trouble with the pacing of In Too Deep. This book seemed more relaxed (that's not to say there aren't tense moments? Exploring an opal mine only to have poisonous spiders and a deadly snake dropped into the the pit, cutting off the only exit, anyone?). But, when I was about three quarters of the way through the book, I kept flipping through the remaining pages, wondering why isn't this over yet? We'd had emotional upheaval (by the way, I don't understand how these kids will trust anyone EVER again. EVER! There is not a person in the world who does not have ulterior motives when it comes to them.), Dan and Amy were moving on to a new country (Indonesia. They explore some of the history surrounding the Krakatau eruption)...But, why is this book still going? I felt like the new territory could have belonged in the seventh book. But as I kept reading, the answer became apparent: More emotional upheaval ahead! Funz! In this installment, Irina's characterization is explored in more depth. And she makes some difficult choices that made me like her a lot. I was also drawn in by the murderous Isabel Kabra. That is one heartless lady. Like psychotic killer heartless. Vile villain heartless. In no way redeemable heartless (and kids, I'm someone who found redeemable aspects in Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort). I thought it was an interesting touch to bring in such a sinister character. Because most of the \"bad guys\" that the Cahill siblings have faced so far have all gradually been debunked from being pure-evil. Untrustworthy still? A few psychotic tendencies when you get in their way? Yes and yes! But not evil. Dinner Conversation: \"She and Dan could be off on a tangent. This trip might not lead to a Clue. They had no evidence that it would. But they had both known the moment they saw [their parents'] passports where they were headed next. They didn't even have to exchange a word\" (p. 4). \"Throw a roo on the barbie, mate!\" Amy winced as the bad Australian accent crashed against her ears. Then she cringed as she saw Dan dressed in an Australian bush hat and a safari jacket. He had a fake rubber snake wrapped around his neck. \"You call this a low profile?\" she hissed, swiping the hat off his head and stuffing it in the side pocket of her pack. \"What was I supposed to do in the airport shop?\" Dan asked. \"I had to buy something\" (p. 5). \"You have been resourceful, I give you that, \" Irina said. \"You think on your feet, you and your brother. But there comes a time when you must think deeper. You must face the thing you don't want to face. Until you do that, you're vulnerable.\" \"To what?\" \"To someone who will tell you what you want to hear,\" Irina said. \"So I ask again. What happened the night of the fire?\" (pp. 55-56). Tasty Rating: !!! ...more I liked the conflict in this one the most so far especially toward the end. Time for another installment of Picky Bitch Reviews Books For Which She is Not the Target Audience. ;) Although I have to say, I was actually pretty impressed with this one for the most part! It's set mostly in Sydney and I like how the author actually seemed to know the Circular Quay and Rocks areas a bit and wasn't totally making it up. I do have to question their logic in taking the bus to Circular Quay though when there's a perfectly good and MUCH FASTER train :P I've done the bus myself whe Time for another installment of Picky Bitch Reviews Books For Which She is Not the Target Audience. ;) Although I have to say, I was actually pretty impressed with this one for the most part!

I do have to question their logic in taking the bus to Circular Quay though when there's a perfectly good and MUCH FASTER train :P I've done the bus myself when there was trackwork (twice! What the hell are the odds of two of my four Sydney trips in a year falling on trackwork weekends?!) and it is soooooooo much slower than the train, omfg. Although the odds of Amy and Dan being there on a trackwork weekend? Pretty high. So I'll let that one slide. BUT. And I am a horrible person but I can't just let this one go. And it's funny that this has only struck me now, at book 6, but... Saladin is a cat. And they've been flying him all over the world. And now they're in Australia and they just landed in Sydney and collected Saladin, the cat, and I AM SORRY BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH QUARANTINE THAT FAST KIDS! I think the last country they were in before this one was Russia? It took me five seconds to google and discover that \"Russia is not an AQIS approved country. This means you can not import a cat or dog to Australia directly from Russia.\" On the one hand, I'm being incredibly nit-picky here I KNOW. But on the other hand, that took me all of five seconds to find out. I know these books are all wildly fanciful and as if Amy and Dan would really be flying all over the place in the real world, but it bugs me when such care is taken to actually research their locations in some cases, but then in other cases there are such huge, glaring errors. Also, if you're going from Darwin to Java, you are not flying over the Indian Ocean. You're flying over the Timor Sea. We learned that one in primary school. Having spent a fair amount of time at Circular Quay myself, I'm also curious about how a speedboat might pull into the dock in front of an idling ferry but okay, okay, letting it slide. The author did mention Tim Tams, Cheezels, Burger Rings, Toobs (ew) and Violet Crumble so massive points for research there. Dan was also being all amazed over chicken flavoured chips! Do they not have those in America? Also Irina seemed to lose all her English but okay I'm done picking now. I enjoyed this one because it was set in Sydney, and Coober Peedy, and Darwin, and apart from the stuff I picked on above it was fast-paced and fun to read. I'm loving Irina even more (view spoiler) [so the ending kind of destroyed me and I hope she managed to survive! (hide spoiler) ] Oh and I loved when Shep said somewhere was \"only\" about an eight hour drive away or something and Amy and Dan were all o.O at his casualness with the huge distance. THAT is very Australian :D ...more The plot thickens, and the adventures are more and more dangerous. Some intriguing new characters appear. Too many coincidences in this book.

Dan felt a chill along his spine. It must have looked similar to this when Robert Cahill Henderson first arrived. It was flat on top, and the white smoke was mixed with gray. Dan heard a rumble of thunder but hardly registered it. He was too much in awe of the sight in front of him. Somehow you could feel the power of it, of how much boiling energy was contained inside. Even though he'd pretended not to listen, his brain couldn't help but record the facts Amy had read to him back on Shep's plane: 36,000 people died, mostly in the tsunamis that followed the final explosion on August 27; two-thirds of the island was blown away; the final, massive explosion was heard more than 2,000 miles off; shock waves circled the earth seven times; the ash cloud was propelled upward for fifty miles and circled the globe for thirteen days, eventually creating amazing sunsets throughout the following year. All the numbers added up to one bad volcano. ...more Amy and Dan continue their search for their sixth clue.Amy has been having flashbacks about when their parent's died. She had a flashback that she told the person that was holding her that she had koalas on her pajama shirt, and that gave the person who was holding her why her parents were gone so long. Amy,Dan and Nellie went to a country to try to find the clue there.When they got there they slept and woke up earlier than Nellie to go find the next clue,but they forgot to leave a note telling Amy and Dan continue their search for their sixth clue.Amy has been having flashbacks about when their parent's died.

I also like the addition to Dan and Amy's family, with another cousin (Shep) to help them find the 39 clues. I understand that they want to keep him out of danger, so they make up a few stories to throw him off track. You also find out a bit more of Nellie's skills as an au pair.

I was thinking about abandoning this series but the end of this book really saved it and I can not wait to read the next book in the series. good book you really should read this series!!! A long series of books for children all by different authors-sort of a mystery action adventure where two orphans try to find clues that their powerful and ancient family have left behind. The last few in the series had gotten a bit predictable but this one was fresher. Fun quick reads, but not amazing. Lather, rinse, repeat. Same story, different book. And I hate that (view spoiler) [Irina (hide spoiler) ] was killed off in this one; one of the more interesting characters in this series. These books don't disappoint. They are, however, fueling my wanderlust. I've added a few more places to my \"Places to see before I die\" list. This one flowed well, the characters had depth and believable progression. The action was great and kept me anxious for resolutions. It was a great book. It was sad and funny. Very interesting how the the author changed it up a little but still good. I did a book report on \"In Too Deep\" and I got a good mark, maybe you could use it to help your learning. Part 1 (Character Paragraphs): Amy Cahill: Amy Hope Cahill is a Madrigal (from the Cahill family) who is the daughter of Hope Cahill, a Madrigal and Arthur Trent, a former Vesper and an honorary Madrigal. She was born in 1994 in Boston, USA. Amy has brownish blond hair while having eyes \u201cgreen like jade\u201d as their grandmother Grace used to say. She is Dan Cahill\u2019s older sister and partner. She I did a book report on \"In Too Deep\" and I got a good mark, maybe you could use it to help your learning. Part 1 (Character Paragraphs): Amy Cahill: Amy Hope Cahill is a Madrigal (from the Cahill family) who is the daughter of Hope Cahill, a Madrigal and Arthur Trent, a former Vesper and an honorary Madrigal. She was born in 1994 in Boston, USA. Amy has brownish blond hair while having eyes \u201cgreen like jade\u201d as their grandmother Grace used to say. She is Dan Cahill\u2019s older sister and partner. She is the one with the worst condition but is one of the best participator in the 39 clues hunt. First, Amy is very smart and she enjoys learning new information by going to the libraries and museum. She has solved many hard puzzles together with her brother Dan while using the knowledge she learned. Those puzzles are very hard that over the century only a very few people have solved them (some of them are anagrams, math puzzles, finding out important information with a little background knowledge, and logical inference.) Second, she is very brave. She joined the 39 clues hunt when she had only a tiny bit of background information about the Cahill family and nobody helping or protecting her and her brother, Dan. Dan Cahill: Dan Arthur Cahill is a Madrigal (from the Cahill family) who is the son of Hope Cahill, a Madrigal and Arthur Trent, a former Vesper and an honorary Madrigal. He was born in 1997 in Boston, USA, just like his sister Amy. Dan has dark brown hair and the same jade green eyes like Amy. He also has a small scar under his right eye that he got from falling on his plastic AK-47 when he had gone \u201cCommando Raiding\u201d at the age of seven. He looks a lot like his father. He is Amy Cahill\u2019s younger brother, partner, and \u201cannoying machine\u201d. He is also the one with the worst condition but is one of the best participator in the 39 clues hunt. First, Dan is very smart ---- he has a photographic memory (it is the ability to remember information or visual images in great detail) and he is very good at math. He had solved the Maze Of Bones\u2019 math problem and had always remembered clues even if his enemies took them away. Second, he is very funny. He can always make jokes when everybody is sad in order to make people feel better. And he always makes everybody around him laugh very hard. Part 2 (Summary): The Viper\u2019s Nest is the seventh book of the first 39 Clues series. The book started with a problem of betrayal and the characters continued the searching of the 39 clues in Africa. There are a lot of bad and evil people or things in the book like Isabel Kabra, some of the Tomas people, the Kabras; there are also some very good guy like Dan, Amy, Nellie, Mr. Bhekisisa, and Professor Robert Bardsley. I also found that there are some people that turned from a bad guy to their good side like Irina Spasky. Dan and Amy founded that Irina was giving them hints to go to the Africa to find the next clue. During the adventure, Dan and Amy went through a lot of challenges that seemed impossible to complete. They had also faced a lot of enemies like Isabel, Ian and Natalie Kabra, Jonah Wizard, Alistair Oh, Bae Oh, the Holt family, and the man in black. I found this book has a lot of interesting knowledge and I have learned a lot of facts about South Africa\u2019s First Nations and Shaka Zulu (a leader of a first nation clan). The most important and exciting part of the book is when Amy and Dan found out that they were actually Madrigals at the end of the book. Part 3 (Critique): I think The Viper\u2019s Nest is a very good book for me. I like it because it is very cool and fun to read as fiction novels always do. It also has some really fun things like mysteries, fights, traps, and battles. I also liked it because I found lots of good characteristics on both Amy and Dan. They are both very brave, smart, funny, helpful, and reliable. I think I could learn from them. I liked the book a lot because it is very exciting but realistic, mostly because everybody was not a clearly bad guy or good guy. They are just people with different personalities. It is like what we have in the real world, in that there is no super clear line between what is good or nice and bad or evil. Even the evilest person you think of has their own good side, and your nicest and most reliable partner might be preparing to backstab behind your back. I learned a lesson from the book: \u201cKnowledge is always useful\u201d Amy and Dan did their research on a lot of things in order to find out where to go, what to find, and how to find it. I think that I would not be able to find even a single bit of the clue because I am not patient and smart enough to find the smallest clues in a library or the Internet. I think this book is a very appropriate book for kids 8 to 14 because it is an exciting, mysterious book and there are barely any bloody scenes or inappropriate facts for kids. It is kind of like Percy Jackson and the Olympus and the Heroes of Olympus series, but it is more realistic than Percy Jackson series although it is still as cool as it. ...more<---C>Jude Watson</---C>", "Title": "In Too Deep"},
