In this instance, people (women, mostly) are interviewed, their experience with John Coetzee explored. These tales are tragicomic, gorgeous in their concise vernacular, realistic in their anecdotal detail, and above all very astute, very piercing. The halo effect, to me, means that we are afforded glimpses, albeit of a very \"human\" human being (J. Coetzee, reclusive, pained, but intuitive auteur, prefame) through vastly different modes-- the squeezing of juice from every possible clue makes this effort an endearing one, often transcending the very story it is telling. Which is what happens here. Coetzee is the most CONSISTENT writer that I know of. This one is yet another one of his, to study, to truly, well, squeeze as much as one can from... Also, as years progress, it is awesome to see the tragedy level becoming a wee-bit more intertwined with scenes of joy, or experiences of true love, by the evolving writer. Now, there is some awesome metalit element to his literature, as he, in the absurdly-titled \"<+++>Summertime</+++>\", is actually dead. Basically, this may be one of the longest faux-eulogies of all time. And one of the most unforgettable; even the pronouncement of \"Fictions\" as a subheading for \"<+++>Summertime</+++>\" is a lie: instead of being short, various tales this novel, alas, is a pretty complete one. ...more 4.5\u2605 Admittedly I haven\u2019t read the first two books of this fictionalised biography (auto-biography?) of a young man growing up in South Africa, Boyhood and Youth .

The John of this book is also a Nobel Prize winner for literature, as is J.M. Even without those books as background, this is an interesting device, letting us travel with a biographer who\u2019s researching the \u2018late\u2019 Coetzee\u2019s life by interviewing people from his past whom he apparently noted himself were important to him. The various voices are different enough that it reads like real interviews and real scrawled notes. It is obvious to me, an armchair expert (yeah, right), that 'John' is a good example of a person with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. All Aspies are different, but being socially awkward is reasonably common, and everyone describes John that way, although there's certainly more to Asperger's and to John than that. It\u2019s also important to remember that if J.M. is writing about himself, he certainly understands his effect on others and writes about it cringingly well. The book is broken into sections, one for each interviewee, and we sense a thread running through the stories. They say he was an unremarkable man who held little real interest for them, and they\u2019re not quite sure how they got involved with him in the first place or why he thinks they\u2019re important. In fact, all are a little embarrassed about it. The women have an air of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe lady doth protest too much methinks.\u201d If he\u2019s so dull, why do they keep saying things like \"just one more story, and then I\u2019m finished\u201d ? Julia is first. She noticed him shopping, and doesn\u2019t he sound like a real catch? \u201cIn appearance he was not what most people would call attractive. He was scrawny, he had a beard, he wore horn-rimmed glasses and sandals. He looked out of place, like a bird, one of those flightless birds; or like an abstracted scientist who had wandered by mistake out of his laboratory. There was an air of seediness about him too, an air of failure. I guessed there was no woman in his life, and it turned out I was right.\u201d She says she is always conscious of when a man is looking at her, but she never once felt that about him. She met him only when he picked up her dropped rolls of wrapping paper and disconcertingly (to her) pressed them into her breast as he returned them. This felt so intimate, that while she intended to avoid him, she stalked him, seduced him, and had an affair. She still talks about him as if he\u2019s dull, silly for wasting his life living with his ill father. But she keeps talking, and talking, and talking . . . about her husband, HIS affairs, her dissatisfaction, her bringing John into her household, her going to his ramshackle cottage and meeting his father. Julia does ramble on. He clearly made an impression, and she enjoyed the verbal sparring. \u201cHe ran his life according to principles, whereas I was a pragmatist. Pragmatism always beats principles; that is just the way things are. The universe moves, the ground changes under our feet; principles are always a step behind. Principles are the stuff of comedy. Comedy is what you get when principles bump into reality. I know he had a reputation for being dour, but John Coetzee was actually quite funny. A figure of comedy. Dour comedy. Which, in an obscure way, he knew, even accepted. That is why I still look back on him with affection. If you want to know.\u201d And then she told him he ought to find a woman to look after him and get married. Cousin Margot is next, and she is embarrassed both by him and for him. They were children together, but as adults, she is uncomfortable with him (like everyone else). When they are stranded overnight in a truck, a farmer rescues them in the morning, and she speaks Afrikaans with him. It\u2019s second-nature for her, \u201cwhereas the Afrikaans John speaks is stiff and bookish. Half of what John says probably goes over Hendrik\u2019s head. \u2018Which is more poetic, do you think, Hendrik: the rising sun or the setting sun? A goat or a sheep?\u2019 \u201d She reckons her family\u2019s days are numbered since the Koup. The Coetzees are all lazy, slack, spineless, yet she\u2019d had higher hopes for John and his bookish ways. Her sister Carol finally spills the beans about John (some of which we know from earlier and some of which roughly matches J.M.\u2019s history). She calls him \u201cstuck-up\u201d. \u201cHe lives with his father, but only because he has no money. He is thirty-something years old with no prospects. He ran away from South Africa to escape the army. Then he was thrown out of America because he broke the law. Now he can\u2019t find a proper job because he is too stuck-up. The two of them live on a the pathetic salary his father gets from the scrapyard where he works.\u201d When Margo asks John if he\u2019s relieved to be back home after leaving America, he says \u201cBut practically speaking, what future do I have in this country, where I have never fitted in? Perhaps a clean break would have been better after all. Cut yourself free of what you love and hope that the wound heals.\u201d The biographer interviews others, including one man, a colleague, who explains that they met and became friends when they applied for the same teaching position at the University of Cape Town. The biographer quotes from John\u2019s own notes about himself and the interview, that he feels he's handled badly. \u201cHe has taken the question too literally, responding too briefly. . . They want something more leisurely, more expansive . . . whether he would fit in in a provincial university that is doing its best to maintain standards in difficult time, to keep the flame of civilization burning. In America, where they take job-hunting seriously, people like him, people who don\u2019t know how to read the agenda behind a question, can\u2019t speak in rounded paragraphs, don\u2019t put themselves over with conviction\u2014in short, people deficient in people skills \u2013 attend training sessions where they learn to look the interrogator in the eye, smile, respond to questions fully and with every appearance of sincerity. Presentation of the self: that is what they call it in America, without irony.\u201d It\u2019s a rambling, piece-meal collection of what sound like reminiscences and notes and embarrassing anecdotes, but by the end, I actually had a clear picture of an interesting man who was trapped by circumstance and escaped into his intellect. And if John is J.M., then I\u2019m glad he moved to South Australia and became an Aussie. ...more It has been a very long time since I read something that original...

There are few authors whose complete works I\u2019ve read, no matter how much I admire their writing. Fewer still about whom I know anything personal. Summertime is a fictionalized biography. Interviews for a biography and notes written by the subject himself, really; an unfinished work. This furthers the impression of looking in on a life \u2013 the naturalness of it, the side of biographies we don\u2019t normally see. It\u2019s an engaging portrait of a man, a writer, an artist, possibly even Coetzee himself. All those things. It\u2019s wise and beautiful and wry and, if not a strictly factual account of his life, perhaps it gives a truer glimpse of him. For what great writer writes anything without showing us something of themselves? One of the things I do know about him is his famed evasiveness. He seems disturbed by the rockstar writer phenomenon and plays with that here. The biographer interviews the women that have most impacted the great author\u2019s life. What indelible mark did he leave on their own? Disappointment. He was only a man. A man who was more alive within himself, than out. He couldn\u2019t dance. To express himself without words \u2013 lots and lots of words \u2013 was nearly impossible. Yet he rarely spoke. The painful awkwardness of being human is captured perfectly as he seems to slyly poke fun at both himself and the rest of us. The women are repeatedly referred to as \u201chis conquests\u201d or \u201chis women\u201d, but it\u2019s clear in each case that it\u2019s him who has been conquered. As they speak of their relations with him, detailing his failings, they reveal more of themselves and their own shortcomings. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re unlikable. More real. They\u2019re strong, self-determined women, both touched and frustrated by this man. He speaks a different language, figuratively. And so he can be no more to them than South Africa in flux \u2013 transitory, impermanent. Disappointment. They move on. The one constant, from beginning to end, is his father. Always in his mind, his memory, the reality of caring for him\u2026 always a silent presence in his relationships with women. For that reason the story feels like an apology. To the women who never knew how much they meant to him. And to his father, for trying to live while he is dying. ...more After Boyhood and Youth , I expected another searing self-portrait told in calm and beautifully measured third-person. What I got is autobiography in quite a revolutionary form: the women who knew Coetzee in his early thirties are interviewed about the now-dead author.

I wasn't bored while reading the book: it's well-written after all (though when I went back to reread it, thinking I might see what others had seen, I couldn't get past the first section), but I kept thinking it was going somewhere and then it wouldn't. I'm sure that was intentional, but I didn't find that it made for great literature, unlike, say, Disgrace . Even though Disgrace arguably has a Coetzee persona as its narratorial voice too, I think its main character stands on its own, unlike the John of this book. ...more

Apart from his decision to mix fiction with fact, and the obvious confusion over what is true and what isn't, there is also the public-humiliation aspect of these books. Coetzee really knows how to take himself down a peg: in this latest installment he can't fix a car, can't dance, can't cook, is a poor lover (and, worse, a strange one), has a messy house, a bad haircut, and persists in a teaching career for which he has no special gift. It even rains on his picnic, literally rains on it. All those things that turn you off a person are embodied in John Coetzee. As one woman puts it, he isn't like a real man; he's like one of those priests who seems a perpetual boy, and then one day you find he's suddenly become old. Somehow this wretch managed to pick up a Nobel Prize. With another writer I might get infuriated with this approach: underneath the masochism, it suggests a control freak who anticipates every criticism--who who wants to tear himself down before anyone else does: \"Look, I'll show you how to do it.\" But I know Coetzee to be a compassionate, empathetic writer; this portrait of a cold fish cannot be the whole truth. So what's going on here? While many of the elements here are completely made up, a certain residue is left over that, I have no doubt, reflects the reality. This was true of the earlier volumes as well. The shape and taste of the life is there, even if the facts are all wrong. We're left suspecting that the artist, who is heroic, has lived deep inside himself--a sentient iceberg that, all these years later, is still worried over the disappointment and confusion he feels he has caused. Coetzee relieves the memoir of all its boring facts, just as he relieves the novel of all its tiresome artifice, to create the only possible answer for his solitude. ...more \u201cTroppo freddo, troppo pulito direi.

Tutto qui\u201d Tempo d\u2019estate conclude il ciclo dei romanzi biografici. Grandissima creazione letteraria: Coetzee \u00e8 morto, un ipotetico biografo, Vincent, intervista cinque persone che sono state vicine allo scrittore: Julia, una amante; Margot, una cugina; Adriana, amore di Coetzee non ricambiato; Martin, un collega; Sophie, una collega con la quale ha avuto una relazione. E attraverso le parole di questo biografo che riporta le interviste a coloro che per un periodo hanno intrecciato le loro vite con quelle di C., Coetzee stesso scrive la propria biografia, cercando- o fingendo - di essere in questo modo il pi\u00f9 obiettivo possibile. Emerge subito la tematica principale, al di l\u00e0 delle vicende quotidiane: la creazione letteraria riesce ad esprimere la realt\u00e0 in modo fedele o in quanto opera letteraria ha vita propria? Ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 auspicabile \u00e8 che il racconto, anche se non pu\u00f2 essere vero alla lettera, lo sia nello spirito? Come possiamo fidarci del resoconto e delle interviste? Gli intervistati, interrogati su una persona di loro conoscenza, non potrebbero essere tutti \u201cinventori di storie\u201d? Non tende ognuno ad evidenziare cose che ad altri potrebbero essere sfuggite o che per altri potrebbero avere scarsa importanza? In ogni racconto c\u2019\u00e8 sempre troppo della persona che racconta e di quella che riporta. Gli intervistati, quando riascoltano le loro parole trascritte dal biografo, spesso non riconoscono la propria voce o i fatti raccontati, sembra loro quasi un\u2019altra storia. Dando voce a cinque punti di vista differenti, C. vuole fornire una gamma di testimonianze indipendenti che partono da prospettive indipendenti. Ma \u00e8 proprio qui la finzione letteraria. Non esiste alcun biografo, e forse non esistono neppure le persone intervistate (non so se siano state presenze reali nella vita di C. o se le abbia create di sana pianta), a parlare \u00e8 Coetzee stesso, sempre Coetzee, che con vera spietatezza e consapevolezza si rivela al lettore, anche nelle sue pieghe pi\u00f9 intime. Non teme il giudizio del lettore, mette in costante dubbio il proprio valore non solo come artista, ma come uomo. Fa dire ad Adriana : \u201cSignor Vincent, ai suoi occhi John Coetzee \u00e8 un grande scrittore e un eroe, io lo accetto\u2026 Per me, invece \u2013 mi perdoni se glielo dico, ma \u00e8 morto e quindi non posso ferire i suoi sentimenti \u2013 per me non \u00e8 nulla\u2026 soltanto un motivo di irritazione, di imbarazzo. Non era nulla e le sue parole non erano nulla\u2026 per me era davvero uno stupido. Quanto alle sue lettere, scrivere lettere ad una donna non dimostra che la si ami. Quest\u2019uomo non era innamorato di me, era innamorato di una qualche idea di me, di qualche fantasia di un\u2019amante latina che si era creato nella mente. Vorrei che al posto mio avesse trovato un\u2019altra scrittrice, un\u2019altra persona fantasiosa di cui innamorarsi. Avrebbero potuto essere felici a fare l\u2019amore tutto il giorno con le loro idee l\u2019uno dell\u2019altro\u201d. Ancora la dicotomia tra arte e vita, artista e uomo, accomunate dal comune atteggiamento di C. nei loro confronti, quel distacco indicato dalla citazione nel titolo di queste righe. E ancora: \"...ma era davvero un grande scrittore? Perch\u00e9, per come la penso io, il talento per le parole non basta se si vuole diventare un grande scrittore. Bisogna essere anche un grande uomo. Lui era un uomo piccolo, un uomo privo di importanza.\" Per\u00f2, dico io, sar\u00e0 anche stato piccolo come uomo, ma come artista ha vinto il Nobel. Che sia possibile, quindi, separare vita e arte? E poi, nell\u2019intervista a Martin - altra presenza maschile insieme al biografo e al fantasma di Coetzee \u2013 si svela il fulcro sia della vita di uomo che di artista: \u201c\u2026io e lui condividevamo la stessa posizione sul Sudafrica, cio\u00e8 sulla nostra presenza in quel paese. Era illegittima. Magari avevamo un diritto astratto di starci, un diritto di nascita, ma su basi fraudolente. La nostra esistenza si fondava su un crimine, precisamente la conquista coloniale, perpetuato dall\u2019apartheid. Ci sentivamo proprio il contrario dei nativi, degli indigeni. Visitatori, residenti temporanei e in questo senso senza casa, senza patria\u201d. Da qui la fuga, il ritorno, e la nuova partenza. Coetzee vive ancora, vegeto, in Australia, con relativa cittadinanza. Forse unico esemplare di uomo freddo che mi abbia in qualche modo interessato. ...more Review 1 of 1: Stephanie You've had the chance to read the book 'Summertime.' What did you think of it?

He is, in fact, a Nobel prize winner in literature, but let's move on. Explain what you mean by \"inventive\" storytelling? Coetzee tried to create the un-autobiography by writing about himself, but through a third person, a fictional journalist, who is writing about Coetzee after his death (get it?). But the fact still remains that this is a pseudo autobiography - but not \"real\". Are the people and events real? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. It's an ambiguous cloud of detachment. Do you think he did want to be detached, hence the method? Yes, he seems like a very detached person! (slight laugh). Little to no emotion toward people, or toward writing. No melodrama (which, for a change, is nice). This is the first book I've written by him and perhaps if I had some more books to compare this with, I would talk about 'Summertime' very differently. I'd imagine that the emotional punch comes not from the words, per se, but from his standoffish construction of emotional events. I heard you never forget about his books once you read them - but for me this hasn't been the case. How can you be emotionally detached from what happened in South Africa during Apartheid? He probably felt a lot, but needed to step back and look at them from a less reactive point of view. Or maybe he just simply isn't emotional. A tabula rosa everyday. He did show some emotion with his acquaintances. What did you think of their observations of Coetzee?\" Well, again, they were Coetzee's observations of himself, not others sizing him up. And by using the very word \"acquaintances\" you revealed something right there -- he didn't have long-lasting friendships. Even his relatives didn't seem to connect with him, nor did his lovers (and boy, what a way to depict yourself -- as a dull, plain lover and a somewhat obsessed wanna-be lover). [Silence.:] My favorite \"interview\" as it were, was with his cousin Margot. That was the longest interview/chapter and the most intriguing. It touched about his childhood, his awkward return to South Africa, and his interactions with his put-your-head-in-the-sand family who could not accept the fact that the country was changing. A few events in the Margot chapter also revealed his bad judgment, which seems to arise due to his guilt about many things. Guilt and detachment. Strange bedfellows. You said that in our previous interview that, and I quote \"All literature has strange bedfellows.\" Oh, I never said that! You're putting words into my mouth. OK, I'll tone that down a bit in the final version. Do you think you'll read another book by Coetzee? If the bookclub deems it so, then I will. Anything else you want to say? Yes, if you're going to quote me, can I review the text before you publish it? Only if you receive your autobiographer's approval first. Interview conducted in San Francisco, CA in April 2010. ...more Mr. Coetzee, how many more books will it take to forgive yourself the original sin of your birth? (Man, do I love short books, I'm incredibly fucking lazy, just spit it out already. Coetzee understands that!) Summertime by J.M. Coetzee is labeled \"fiction,\" not \"a novel,\" or \"a collection of autobiographical investigations disguised as a story cycle,\" or some other generic propositon. Just \"fiction.\" Ok, it goes this way: there is a biographer, an academic, who goes through the deceased John Coetzee's notebooks and focuses a lot of effort on five extended interviews with four women and one man who were important in Coetzee's life. Two of the women were sexually involved with him; one was a cousin; on Summertime by J.M. Coetzee is labeled \"fiction,\" not \"a novel,\" or \"a collection of autobiographical investigations disguised as a story cycle,\" or some other generic propositon. Just \"fiction.\" Ok, it goes this way: there is a biographer, an academic, who goes through the deceased John Coetzee's notebooks and focuses a lot of effort on five extended interviews with four women and one man who were important in Coetzee's life. Two of the women were sexually involved with him; one was a cousin; one did everything she could not to accept his advances. The man is presented as a literary friend, an academic. Spun out at novel-length, this manuscript effectively uses the apparent nonentity of John Coetzee as he saw (sees) himself in the form of a blank canvas upon which the five interviewees can talk about themselves. We learn more about them than him. About him we learn he's resevered or shy, well but generally educated, something of a utopian, something of a romantic, a dutiful son who dislikes being a dutiful son when his father's health begins to break down\u2026and so on. About the interviewees we learn that they managed to live without receiving a great deal from the likes of John Coetzee. We hear about their affairs, their childhoods, their complications living in South Africa, and the limits of being human. One denounces Coetzee; one finds him a family misfit; one had some good times with him\u2026The book goes on this way. The notion that this is Coetzee fictionalizing Coetzee while also probing for that elusive being--the author \"behind\" the books--isn't overplayed as Philip Roth would overplay it. There's no grand theory as to the interpenetration of the real and the fictional, or their interchangeability. As a consequence, the articulate documentary quality of Summertime, a title whose meaning eludes me, feels thin. This is an idea book by a writer who can take just about any idea and do something highly professional with it. It's not a lot more than that. It lacks heat, plot, cunning, and a willingness to do more by way of introspection than put the author across as as something of an introverted clutz. I haven't read it in a while, but I recall John Updike's memoir in essayistic fragments, Self-Consciousness, as a great deal more engaging and enlightening. He does his best to tell \"the truth\" about himself, a very hard thing to do. Coetzee, on the other hand, skillfully diddles with the post-modern notion that the author, Coetzee, isn't the point, his political views aren't the point, his lack of engagement with women isn't the point\u2026the point is in his books, and this book, a fiction, isn't really a book, it's a thematic exploration\u2026but of what? The other day a friend asked me about a book we were discussing, \"But don't you think it's well-written?\" I said, \"Yes, of course, the sentences are solid, the pace is good, the imagery is appropriate\u2026but there's something to fiction that goes beyond that.\" I meant that fiction must have an internal dynamic and objective that is more than skill in managing words. Late in this book, a former colleague tells the interviewer that where Coetzee fell short was in not taking chances, in deferring to the precepts of genre, in not wrecking conventional expections in the interests of passion. The larger reference here was to Russian writers of the 19th century--Gogol, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, I would think. Since Coetzee is playing the character being interviewed about him, it appears he has understood his own limitations well. What's truly curious is that Summertime was \"a finalist for the 2009 Man Booker Prize,\" which we hear about all the time as Great Britain's highest literary award. Why? Because even though a book about Coetzee by Coetzee isn't alive, it still deserves to be on such lists\u2026because Coetzee is Coetzee? I'm not trying to damn the book, just put it in perspective. It's sort of a readable, articulate book on a par with middle-grade wine, which is okay on a weekend when you're looking for a way to pass the time. For a collection of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle). ...more I'll be honest: I haven't cared much for Coetzee's work in the last ten years or so. I've been of the opinion that he peaked with Disgrace ; his recent novels have been filled with intrusive and barely-veiled author surrogates (especially Elizabeth Costello) who tend to derail an otherwise engrossing narrative. It was a pleasure, then, to discover that Coetzee has taken that conceit and turned it on it's head here.

It was a pleasure, then, to discover that Coetzee has taken that conceit and turned it on it's head here. By writing about his life as being examined by a hagiographic biographer, Coetzee turns an almost painfully unflinching eye on his own life, this time without the cover of a fictional character (though I have no idea whether or not the people interviewed about him within the book are real individuals or not). For an author not generally known for his humor (in person or fiction), Coetzee does an often very funny job of - as the British say - taking the piss out of himself. Though it's not the equal to his magnificent Disgrace (a book which just destroys me every time I read it), or even on the level of the prescient Waiting for the Barbarians , I can see why this was nominated for the Booker Prize. The final section is among the most heartbreaking things I have ever read. ...more This is the most thinly disguised autobiographical fiction I have ever read. In fact I would hesitate to call it fiction at all. The only fictional element seems to be that Coetzee is suppposedly dead in this \"novel\".Still makes for interesting reading though. And he doesn't paint a very flattering picture of himself. I'll have to read Boyhood and Youth now, which are his other two autobiographical novels. Novelists enjoy taking revenge on biographers. A typical example of this phenomenon is William Golding\u2019s The Paper Men (1984), in which a biographer is featured as a snoop digging through his subject\u2019s kitchen pail. Only in rare instances do biographers not come off as second-raters and sensationalists, as in Bernard Malamud\u2019s Dubin\u2019s Lives (1979).

But no writer of distinction has definitively challenged the line Henry James laid down in The Aspern Papers (1888), where the biographer is dismissed as a \u201cpublishing scoundrel.\u201d Thus J. M. Coetzee\u2019s Summertime is quite a surprise. Rather than focusing on the unseemly prying biographer\u2014a young Englishman named only as Vincent, about whom we learn very little\u2014the subject, Coetzee himself (or rather his fictional persona, since the Coetzee of the novel is deceased) draws most of the fire. The biographer\u2019s interviewees, who represent quite a range of ages, nationalities, genders, and occupations, come to remarkably similar conclusions about Coetzee: He was not much of a lover and did not demonstrate the genius that would be expected of a Nobel Prize winner. \u201cWomen didn\u2019t fall for him,\u201d reports Dr. Julia Frankl, who had an affair with the writer. His cousin Margot Jonker wonders what happened to the brilliant boy she once loved and why he has become a drifter living with his father. To Adrianna Nascimento, a Brazilian woman who spurned Coetzee\u2019s advances, he is a fool and hardly a man at all. But wait! It gets worse: Sophie Deno\u00ebl, one of Coetzee\u2019s colleagues who taught a course with him, concludes he is an overrated writer devoid of originality. The interviews make powerful, compelling reading because the voices are so distinctive. The biographer rarely interjects himself. He asks questions and occasionally responds to his interviewee\u2019s queries, fending off their hostile comments about biographers as gossip-mongers by blandly announcing that they can excise whatever they deem inappropriate from his narrative. The only male interviewee, Martin, is concerned that Vincent\u2019s interest in Coetzee\u2019s personal life will come \u201cat the expense of the man\u2019s actual achievement as a writer.\u201d But this objection is raised perfunctorily and does not merit the attention some reviewers give it as an example of the novel\u2019s supposedly anti-biographical theme. Quite often the biographer maintains silence in the face of provocative comments calling his integrity into question. He is there to get the story and remains thoroughly professional. As a result, so much of the palaver about the indiscretions of biographers seems petty\u2014especially compared to this engrossing investigation of how friends, family, and lovers assess the man they knew. They are far harder on him than any biographer could possibly be. Coetzee has used himself\u2014or should we say a simulacrum of himself\u2014to show that biography has a powerful a story to tell, regardless of who is hurt and whose privacy is violated. Coetzee seems an anomaly among modern authors, many of whom put their energies into thwarting biographers and trashing the genre. In contrast, Coetzee addresses the profound human need biography satisfies. It is as if he said to himself, \u201cI cannot control what others have thought of me. In fact, there is a pattern of such reactions that some biographer is bound to shape into a narrative. So why not take a whack at it myself?\u201d For Coetzee, the biographer is not the issue. In Summertime, we do not even learn Vincent\u2019s full name, let alone the experiences that led him to pick his subject\u2014 his motivations are not the point. On the contrary, Coetzee seems to realize that he has drawn the world to himself, and the world will find him out. A biography is not something he owes the public; it is just inevitable, no matter what he does and no matter what kind of life he has fashioned. In so far as the biographer does present a brief for his work, it is mainly this idea that Coetzee belongs to the world and no permission or authorization is required to write Coetzee\u2019s life. The biographer tells this to one of his wary informants, but at the same time he acknowledges that each of his interviewees knew Coetzee in a particular way and that he wants to preserve their memories. At first, it may seem that Vincent is ceding too much when he agrees to omit certain stories, but the overall pattern of the testimony is so persuasive that eliminating this or that iteration of it hardly matters. Is this novel a disguised autobiography? The question seems to be dismissed in Summertime when Vincent remarks that Coetzee was a \u201cfictioneer\u201d: \u201cIn his letters he is making up a fiction of himself for his correspondents; in his diaries he is doing much the same for his own eyes, or perhaps for posterity.\u201d Such comments level the playing field on which biography and autobiography are the contestants. In effect, there is no unimpeachable standard of truth by which a biography can be found wanting. Thus the extracts from the fictive Coetzee\u2019s notebooks do nothing to undermine the biographer\u2019s work. Summertime is that rare novel that grants biography its autonomy and treats the biographer as an independent agent, not a parasite or a hanger-on to someone else\u2019s life. It is also a work of fiction that perhaps will break the mold Henry James cast for biography, one that has bedeviled its practitioners for more than a century. ...more When a writer makes himself the subject of a biography written by a fictitious biographer, and when those who are being interviewed for the record are mainly the women in his life, both lovers and despisers, all of whom did not think much of him as a man, one wonders whether the writer is building a monument to himself or placing himself under the microscope of public scrutiny.

But given that this book is of the writer\u2019s creation, one also wonders whether the fault lines on display are carefully chosen and whether other, more embarrassing ones, have been deliberately left out. In this book, set between the years 1972-76, before he received international acclaim for his writing, Coetzee is in his thirties, and is very much the non-entity; expelled from America for protesting the Vietnam War, he is living with his ailing father back in Cape Town. Single, under-employed as an English teacher, unkempt and unattractive to women, he does not provide any hint of the Nobel prize winning author he will eventually turn out to be. All he wants to do is write poetry. He hates teaching, the profession he will ultimately spend forty-plus years in. He is unable to give of himself, because he needs to preserve his energy for his art. He believes in manual labour, because that makes him feel like the \u201cothers,\u201d and so he is seen building a concrete support wall around his father\u2019s crumbling house \u2013 the only white man sweating it out in the heat, a place normally reserved for blacks and coloureds. He has no friends but holds firm views on the world: politics is a theatre for hatred, nothing is worth fighting for, the true natives of South Africa are the coloureds with the whites and blacks being the interlopers, and so on, he philosophises. The \u201cbiographer\u201d travels around the world to interview five people (four women and a man) who all had a relationship, sexual, familial or collegial with the author who is supposedly dead at this time after having achieved global fame. Their dispersion around the planet is a reflection of the mass migrations out of South Africa that took place in the Apartheid years and later; Coetzee himself ultimately settled in Australia. \u201cDon\u2019t speak ill of the dead\u201d does not apply here for those interviewed are candid on Coetzee\u2019s inconsequence and lack of accomplishment during these wilderness years. There are additional undated notes in Coetzee\u2019s notebooks to assist the biographer, in which the subject prefers to write of himself in the third person. The life of a famous writer is always of interest to readers and to other aspiring writers. But I wondered why Coetzee choses to focus on this dead period of his adult life, unless it is to show the time he spent with his father (the two weren\u2019t really close, but enjoyed a forced closeness during this time). There is not much mentioned about his writing during these years either, except to say that he has published his first novel and is working on the second. The only conclusion I can draw is that Coetzee is slowly archiving his life as he ages: with Youth and Boyhood already delivered, Summertime is the next stage, uneventful though it is. He has already written semi-autobiographical novels like Disgrace and Diary of a Bad Year that talk to the aging academic and writer. Perhaps it will not be too long before we see the appearance of Fall and Winter, when the mature Coetzee\u2019s real life is laid out for further public examination, and perhaps, this time he will not pull any punches but let it all hang out. ...more I'm moving this to \"read\" even though I stopped a little over halfway and skimmed a little bit of the end.

I thought at first it would be about the political situation in south africa, since it starts off talking about that, but it quickly devolves into several encounters of the author with other people, mostly women, who all find him unappealing, unattractive, aloof, and perhaps a touch autistic. It's about him failing to connect with other people, with the stories told from the perspective of those who have known him. These are the people who were closer to him than anybody, yet they all found him uninteresting and almost repulsive on some level. He lives with his father because neither of them have much money and appears to be a failure in life with few career prospects and nearly zero prospects for any kind of significant interpersonal relationship. The story wanders. There are some interesting techniques used, which might be original and thus noteworthy. The other characters, the ones who find it so hard to connect to the author in any way, lead shallow, meaningless lives, yet look down on the author for being even worse than themselves. The story ends with him facing the deteriorating health of his father, which will make him much harder to care for. Depressing and mostly pointless prose, in my mind. Perhaps the man is presenting an authentic picture of himself (though I doubt it; I'm sure it was changed quite a bit in the process of novelization). Nonetheless, there are so few references to anything worthwhile in his life. Sure he must have had something, interests, the rich worlds of the books that he was always supposedly reading, to sustain him and make his head a more pleasant place to hang out in. There was just no relief, and as my fast forwarding to the end revealed, it became more bleak rather than less. All that to say I will not be reading more of this man's works in the future. Off to start some Junot Diaz! I have much higher hopes for him. ...more In this his third fictional autobiography, Coetzee portrays the early adulthood of a man very much like himself \u2014 with even the same name, \"John Coetzee\" \u2014 with similar origins and history (born into an English-speaking Afrikaner family near Capetown, returned to South Africa after some years abroad including the US, later to become a well-known writer).

However this fictional John Coetzee is now dead, and what we learn about this period of his life, in his 30s and before he achieved fame as a writer, comes from journal notes and interviews by an English academic of people who were somehow involved with him then: a suburban housewife in an adulterous affair, an Afrikaans-speaking cousin with whom he had as a child fantasized marriage, a younger French woman and college-teaching colleague who saw her affair with him as a way to overcome a bad marriage, a Brazilian woman he ineffectually pursued, and a male teaching colleague with whom he had a cordial but rather distant friendship. The Coetzee portrayed here is a man very sensitive to injustice, hopelessly incompetent socially, who has left his acquaintances somewhat puzzled that he ever amounted to anything. Certainly, to some extent this is an effort by the author to see himself as others see him (as the Burns poem has it), but the novel is not so much about a real John Coetzee as about South Africa in the 1970s, the limitations and hypocrisies in Afrikaner culture, the indifference of most of the world (at least in that setting) to the literature that so much matters to the fictional and to the real John Coetzee. Besides the self-deprecating and often very amusing tone of the central protrait, the book offers clear-eyed, unsentimental perceptions of Afrikaner self-isolation (with a language spoken nowhere else in the world, as the fictitious Coetzee has jotted in his journal), the mind-dulling routines of college ritual, and the sharply contrasting concepts of manliness as between the protagonist himself and, most sharply, the Brazilian widow who remembers her big, bold husband. ...more This curious, sly and rather ruthless quasi-autobiography is the 3rd volume of Scenes From a Provincial life.

But this is not a straightforward story to illustrate the great conflicts of the day, although they are referred to and the moral dilemma of the white natives is clearly explicated, the focus is the questionable character of the author himself and consists in the main of a series of interiews with the enigmatic, quintessential listener, the biographer. It seems that Coetzee is aiming to get at the quintessential truth of himself by creating the macabre fiction that he is already dead and his biographer is attempting to achieve a coherent perspective from the handful of people that Coetzee revealed in his journals that had the greatest impact on his life. That he could project such indifference and scorn on himself is truly heartbreaking.The irony is, his claim to mediocrity is proved false by his cleverness and his tremendous list of titles. I enjoyed reading this book and like the spare and eloquent writing. According to GR star system, I am able to give it only a 3. September 2015 when I picked up this book at the library, I had a faint feeling that I had read it before, the cover seemed so familiar. Reading a bit sparked no recognition however, and in the mood for Coetzee's spare prose I took it home and began to read. To my mortification, I remembered the premise but none of the characters, and when I entered the book here there was my review. I have given it an extra star and a more thorough reading. ...more J.M.

This isn't that biography; rather it's notes from interviews the biographer collected from a handful of people who knew Coetzee, mostly women who held some kind of romantic interest for him, discussing their relationship and the kind of man that he was. To be clear, this is fiction: For instance, much of the narrative discusses Coetzee's relationship living with his aging father, yet accounts suggest this is not factually accurate. Further, what emerges is a not very flattering portrait of a man who seemed to only dabble in writing and wasn't taken seriously as an author--his real-life Nobel Prize and two Booker Prizes dispute this characterization; though his winning the Nobel as well as the real titles of his books are mentioned. Certainly much of the fiction is mixed up with fact, and the piecing out what is \"real\" is one intriguing aspect of the narrative: After all, don't we all have versions of ourselves we believe in, which may or may not coincide with the ways others perceive us? In taking on this conceit, Coetzee acknowledges that one's public life is a complicated affair, and that trying to write one's life story is even more complicated. Beyond this idea, the book is beautifully written. A brief exchange between cousins reflecting on growing up in the rural regions of South Africa evoked such nostalgia in me for a childhood I never had, and the book has such a longing melancholy that, while at the same time it seems to be describing the life of a man who barely lived, it encourages such a fierce desire to live. ...more Several years ago I read in quick succession Coetzee's 2 volumes of memoir, Boyhood: Scenes from Provincial Life and Youth.

It sustains the autobiographical interest because you feel like many elements of the truth are here. You feel as if the real J. M. Coetzee is being so unabashedly laid bare. There's little narrative flow here, but the character study and perspectives on Coetzee the man by these 5 interviewees is fascinating. One problem for me was what I considered a weak ending. The novel's framed by writings we're told are from Coetzee's notebooks and the biographer's annotations to them. Following the captivating material in the interviews themselves, the final section of notebook entries seemed, to me, not connected to the novel. I couldn't see the unity. But it's fine otherwise. I enjoyed it. Coetzee writes well about himself, or about himself as a character in his novels. While enjoying Elizabeth Costello and Slow Man--and maybe even Disgrace--with that self-as-protagonist perspective, I'd been seriously disappointed by Diary of a Bad Year. Sumnmertime, however, shows again the strengths we associate with him. ...more Ugggggghhhh! Picked this up because I found it on the shelf at the library when I didn't have any holds waiting for me, and I keep on thinking about fucking Disgrace , and thought maybe this one would be relevant for the season. Sort of forgot how much I basically hate this guy, except (maybe) for Elizabeth Costello, which even though it's another platform for this guy's shitty moralizing at least is ostensibly about a lady. Also in some weird way I think he gave me the idea to become a librarian Ugggggghhhh!

(There's something funny about these men that make a parade of their self-hate, and I can't help but hate them too (thinking of Franzen here, and some other assholes) and for some reason they seem to be taken the most seriously as \"serious artists\" and get allowed to write \"novels of ideas.\" What's up with that? I wonder what Zambreno thinks of it. [Ed. note: Apparently she adores Coetzee , although questions how EC would have been received in written by a woman. Also, by coincidence(?) she compares work to Doris Lessing's Golden Notebook, which is exactly what I am switching out -- synchronicity!]) ...more As I started reading this book I googled J.M.Coetzee. He came up as one of the most celebrated author in anglosphere. I was living under a rock to have never ever heard of this two times booker winner and Nobel laureate . This book is supposed to be a fictional autobiography . That seems like an oxymoron does nt it? Well that is just the beginning of the interesting part.

He came up as one of the most celebrated author in anglosphere. I was living under a rock to have never ever heard of this two times booker winner and Nobel laureate . This book is supposed to be a fictional autobiography . That seems like an oxymoron does nt it? Well that is just the beginning of the interesting part. The author has written his story as interviews by his biographer with important people in his life. So what he has written are perceptions of other people of him. If you think it at the next level it is what the author perceives other people perceive of him. Tricky right? I found it very interesting , very unique. The biographer meets up with a Julia with whom he had an affair, Margot - a cousin, Adraina -a woman who he had a crush on, Sophie - an old flame and Martin - a colleague. Since it is a fictional autobiography you tend to wonder how much of the characters are fact. The book takes us through his years in South Africa . He divulges bits of his relationship with his father, portions of his political affiliations and facets of his personality . The book is a very enjoyable and gripping read and the most engaging way of writing an autobiography ever. ...more Brilliant. Another mindbender from JMC. In 266 pages he has foiled his inevitable biographers, had some fun and made many salient points about many things including writing, politcs and the human condition. Who else would have himself described as not homosexual, but still \"soft,\" \"not a man,\" \"tepid\" and \"not made for the company of women?\" Not to mention \"autistic\" in bed.

Another interesting description of the early writer: \"Without being a Dionysian himself, he approved in principle of Dionysianism. Approved in principle of letting oneself go, though I don't think he ever let himself go -- would probably have not known how.\" There's plenty of Kafka here, including the \"like a dog\" line JCM has used before, and of course in the relationship between John Coetzee and his father, tho, not surprisingly, the power tables are turned, quite fiercely at times. There are glimpes into JMC's literary goals. John says: \"A gesture of refusal in the face of time. A bid for immortality.\" The sentiment is of course mocked by his lover at the time. Finally, this observation for my teacher friends, from one of the interviewees: \"The ranks of the teaching profession are, as you must know, full of refugees and misfits.\" Let's hope so. ...more After glancing at the front cover, I opened this book up to the inside flap and read that it was about a biographer researching Coetzee's life.

Pretty gutsy, but I figured it would be awesome. And it was. The only slightly bad thing about this book, written in a series of conversations between the biographer and people who knew John Coetzee when he was a young man, for me, is that the first section with Margot stood out as a clear favorite. You like a book to get better as it goes, but for whatever reason the first portion interested me more. There was a lengthy conversation between Margot and Coetzee about why he writes that resonated with me quite strongly. ...more Creo que no leer\u00e9 m\u00e1s libros de este autor.
