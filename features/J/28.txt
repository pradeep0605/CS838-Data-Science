And sometimes I can't help but wonder, what if THAT is what exactly Palahniuk wants the readers to feel about his works? Feel challenged by it, dislike it, feel disgusted or insulted by it--all of these by hurling the naked truths of human nature to the face of people in the harshest possible way? My first Palahniuk book is Choke, and I was sort of culture shocked when I read it--a multitude of f-bombs being dropped from heavenly heights, sexually explicit situations, bitter but truthful ruminations about life. Completely different from the books I've been reading--and that's saying something because I usually go for the \"dark side\" of literature. I thought Choke would already build my literary panoply when it comes to his works. But I was wrong--<+++>Diary</+++> might not lie on the opposite side of the spectrum when leveled with his other works, but it's a new account of insane despair that I'm not really used to. <+++>Diary</+++> is a story about art,and, well, the crazy reality that most desperate people live. It also tackles a Marxist concept but viewed from a strangely twisted angle. It is written mostly in the second person point of view and in the format of a 'coma diary' written by the female protagonist, <---C>Misty Wilmot</---C>. There is no subtlety in Palahniuk's style of writing, and when what he writes stabs, it stabs straight to the heart and conscience. It gets under your skin most of the time. I will not detail everything, but I just want to say that this is a satisfying read. The Palahniuk \"flavor\" is exotic and dark, and it's the sort of taste that most readers will only refer to as \"poison\". If only everyone reads closely, the antidote to the venom of reality that Palahniuk presents in this work is also present--right between the lines. ...more The way this narrative was a dairy while also describing a diary was an amazing idea. The setting and the characters were the right type of people in the right place but something about it all made it sort of gross to read. And that was probably the point and I probably missed that but I wish it was more of an actual diary. I started reading with that idea and am a huge fan of epistolary fiction. My favorite of which is The Sorrows of Young Mike . Yes, and? \u201cIt's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness.<---F> We learn so little from peace</---F>.\u201d \u2015 Chuck Palahniuk, Diary no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO. NO. This book is ridiculous. I've never found it exactly difficult to get through a Chuck Palahniuk book because he's one of the greatest, most complex writers I know of, but this book... it was such a drag. I prefferred babysitting over reading Diary. I had to pull myself through it each and every day. I get anxious if I don't finish a book so I couldn't toss it aside. The only reason I completely forced myself through it in less than a month is because I was so exci no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO. NO. This book is ridiculous.

The only reason I completely forced myself through it in less than a month is because I was so excited to read another book I'd recieved in the mail. I love Palahniuk's writing style, I won't lie. The repitition and the way he makes you feel like he's TALKING to you instead of telling a story... I don't know. I like it. but in Diary, his writing style couldn't make up for the fact that it was just boring? I don't see how anyone could find this interesting and sometimes I worry that maybe I missed the moral/point of the story and i always want to reread it.. but I don't think I could bring myself to do it. Bleh. ...more Like all of Palahniuk\u2019s other work, Diary is vivid, disturbing, grotesque, and a bit supernatural. If his descriptions don\u2019t leave you feeling at least somewhat squeamish, then you must have no imagination whatsoever. He is like a painter who makes the simplest object look hideously grotesque, who can look at a common scene and envision it in the twisted way only a serial killer might.

If his descriptions don\u2019t leave you feeling at least somewhat squeamish, then you must have no imagination whatsoever. He is like a painter who makes the simplest object look hideously grotesque, who can look at a common scene and envision it in the twisted way only a serial killer might. Only, the serial killers in his novels don\u2019t kill for pleasure; they kill for reasons much more creative than that. Palahniuk is nothing if not creative. Diary is written as a diary from the point of view of the protagonist, Misty, in the fashion of a long letter written to her comatose husband Peter. However, because she is writing to him directly, she refers to \u201cyou,\u201d who also happens to be the reader, creating a number of identity overlaps. Moreover, the narrative habit of referring to oneself as \u201cyou\u201d when writing in a diary comes up a number of times, because it would be equally applicable as referring to Peter or the reader as \u201cyou.\u201d And none of this even begins to brush the surface of the story, which involves Misty\u2019s allegedly supernatural artistic abilities, her inexplicable attraction to Peter\u2019s shiny junk jewelry (<---B>which he pinned through his own scabby skin</---B>), and the creepy warnings she finds inside sealed-off rooms of buildings Peter remodeled before he tried to kill himself. Invisible Monsters will always be my favorite Palahniuk novel, and Fight Club will always be the most famous. Haunted might very well be the most disturbing. But Diary pays homage to what Palahniuk does best: turn a common story and a common story form into a extraordinary and very unsettling tale. ...more Hey, goodreads. Remember how seriously I used to take you? I would tell you every time I finished a book, and then I would tell you about the book. I guess I haven't been doing that as much lately. Kind of like how Chuck Palahniuk has been phoning it in for three books now, huh? Because look, this was the last one of his books I hadn't read. Now I have read all of them. And Chuck? The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is because it wasn't Rant, which I have built up in my head to be Hey, goodreads. Remember how seriously I used to take you?

The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is because it wasn't Rant, which I have built up in my head to be your grand achievement, or whatever the French word is. But Diary was great! Remember when your writing used to be transgressive not because of vibrator jokes, but because of the grim tone and the overwhelming, almost-but-not-quite cartoonishness of the immorality of all the characters? This was fun! You did interesting things with the plot- I don't even want to say what because it would give it away! The fact that you think girls are icky was expressed interestingly, instead of boringly! The metaphysical stuff was fun, the repeated staccato phrases didn't get overwhelming or boring, and there were homos. Thumbs up, Chuck. So here's what I think: Snuff, Pygmy and Tell-All are Chuck's humor trilogy. Y'know how he likes to write in trilogies? Diary is part of the horror trilogy with Haunted and... something else, I forget what. Well, Chuck, your humor trilogy has failed. Please write a second horror trilogy! Or keep doing sci-fi, like Rant! Because when you are on your are on. Finishing this one is kinda bittersweet. ...more This was my first selection to our book group -- and it definitely shook things up a bit. I love Palahniuk, and this is actually my favourite of his. Fight Club comes second, so if you hate Fight Club, I can't think you'll like this. The style is still there -- short, choppy ideas repeated until you wonder why, a vocabulary that makes you double take from time to time. One of our book groupies actually read it with a dictionary to hand because she wanted to know what every word meant.

One of our book groupies actually read it with a dictionary to hand because she wanted to know what every word meant. Which, given my love of dictionaries, I think is pretty cool in its own little way. What I really love about this one, to set it apart from the others, is the amazing construction of the female narrator (something I wasn't sure he could do...but he certainly can) and the art slant to everything. It's a different perspective than the out-to-get-the-corporate-world of Fight Club or the out-to-get-the-truth-out of Survivor. It's more insular and introspective (well, as a diary should be) and the value of the written word and the work of art are important here...not so much the world. Don't read it if you'll be phased by the profanity or any of quite a few twisted images, but if you're willing to let it go as not-part-of-your-reality, it will definitely give you something to think about. I actually find it empowering, but there's no way I could explain that in less than about six lifetimes. ...more The Correspondents #4 Dear MJ, Received your letter via Patrick.

Original storyline as usual, he does not disappoint... but rather brings it... fully (more so then any other book he has written, in my opinion). Suffering = living. Suffering = true feeling. Suffering = emotions. Emotions = Open mind. Open mind = creativity. Creativity = Artistic excellence. (Or something along those lines). This book made me realize why (as an artist) I go through dry spells of creativity and original thoughts/expressions. Sometimes I feel like things just click and sometimes I feel like I can't produce anything worth sharing (all the bullshit). It's absolutely true that when you are suffering... you think more, you brood more, you long for things to work out. BUT while things AREN'T working out... your mind is working in overtime. When things are going well in life, it's easy to go day to day, thinking about life and the deeper meaning of things less. When things aren't going well... you tend to open your mind a little, to try and figure out why... all those serious and depressing life questions come to the surface and those thoughts are what creates meaningful art. Any art with value has extreme emotions and deeper meanings to it... things that can't be reached unless you try real hard (which works better when your mind is open to the suffering). Think about it... at what time in your life do you ask yourself the deep questions regarding your life? Usually once something goes wrong. When things are going good, why think about things which could depress you? We all know that the meaning of life, in the overall scheme of things, is depressing as hell... and usually isn't brooded upon until we are in situations which put us there in the first place. Okay, so overall... one of my favorite book and HIGHLY recommended to anyone who has a creative bone in their body. It will help you recognize creativity, where it stems from and the sad reality behind anything created with any value. Depressing book... yes. But it is Chuck and should be expected. By far my favorite Chuck Palahniuk book yet. (Even though I know Haunted was his baby and has been the book he has been wanting to write throughout his entire career... I still believe this is his best). ...more I have read over 8 books by this author and the only reason i gave him two stars was because i love fight club so much. honestly, i thought the movie was

describing people's musculature in action, it all felt pretentious instead of charming, or amusing. definitely served as a writerly warning to me. the core idea for the story itself - the origins of which i am a little confused about (enclosed letter from a fan, claiming at least partial authorship?) - it's an interesting one, and in its sleepy, disjointed little way, was entertaining, but just barely. i put this book down for over a month, and it's the first time i haven't read a book straight through. still, i can tell palahniuk is a good writer (or at least has the potential to be), and will likely check out more of his work...someday. ...more ETA: So I bought this edition because apparently I'm in love with the book.

Reasons I gave this 4 stars before and now I'm giving it 5 and how it's one of Chuck's best: -it is boring at the beginning. Don't get me wrong. It's boring because Chuck is already talking about some things you'll only understand if you've read the whole book already. That's why reading this again makes it way greater and more appealing. Reading it again will make you appreciate the genius of Chuck. How he perfectly weaves the plot and how clues are everywhere. And how he perfectly uses the repetition that were so overwhelming at first. And how he stirs and plays with your emotion. -I didn't find the story--the medium where Chuck's philosophy moves--fits the nihilistic points before. But rereading it made me understand. The weather today is obvious adoration of a book. \"Your handwriting. The way you walk. Which china pattern you choose. It's all giving you away. Everything you do shows your hand. Your whole drug history's in a strand of your hair. Your fingernails. The forensic details. The lining of your stomach is a document. The calluses on your hand tell all your secrets. Your teeth give you away. Your accent. The wrinkles around your mouth and eyes. Everything you do shows your hand. Everything is a self-portrait. Everything is a diary.\" (view spoiler) [ plus point is there are gay characters lol (hide spoiler) ] First reading review: I wonder where would I be now if I haven't met Chuck. He gets to the truth of things, of humanity, its real face. \u201cIt's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness.

In the case of this one, I really thought I had it figured out. Turns out, I didn't. I should probably just give up trying and enjoy the story. Which I usually do. Misty lives on Waytansea Island with a husband in a coma and a mother in law who seems bent on pushing her to be the famous artist everyone seems to think she is. While Misty went to school for art, she takes it as an insult that everyone thinks she, a poor white trash girl, I'm always struck by just how weird Palahniuk's novels are.

Misty lives on Waytansea Island with a husband in a coma and a mother in law who seems bent on pushing her to be the famous artist everyone seems to think she is. While Misty went to school for art, she takes it as an insult that everyone thinks she, a poor white trash girl, should be producing great works of art. After her husband fails an attempt at suicide, she begins a diary that she writes to him in his vegatative state. As she chronicles her everyday life, she tells of meeting Angel, a man who seems to appreciate her work too much. She tells of people that her husband did work for calling and threatening to sue for disappearing rooms and strange writing underneath the dry wall and wallpaper work. Misty's story gets stranger as her mother in law and those around her all seem to be conspiring and pushing for the art they \"know\" she can produce. Through most of this book, I was trying to see if I could figure out the \"secret.\" I never did. Parts of it dragged, and parts of it had to be re-read just because his style of writing isn't always standard. But by the end, I was completely into the story and, like always, completely surprised. Definitely a good read for Palahniuk fans or anyone who likes novels that don't follow anything relatively normal. ...more Some strange shit. Always the strange shit, Chuck.

I've read his recent book, Damned, and in that, Chuck still had his 'repetitive use' of phrases and words.. Making it look like some hidden clues for deciphering something that might come in handy when Chuck leaves the world, make a name of his own, as the author with readers disgusted by his works.. I don't know. Maybe he really wanted to have this effect on people. He writes like this to manipulate, and confuse. And he's better this way, really. I like the book. I really like it. Misty spoke to me in some unexplainable ways to awaken my own 'personal coma'. I really liked the idea of some form of a cult, a pagan god, witchcraft, tradition and the thrill I feel especially towards the ending. Though I never knew what her mural looked like, I'd say it was perfect that people were burned to death. ...more Il miglior libro di Palahniuk che io abbia letto.

I've walked away from other novels that have made me nervous and twitchy, but these two made me all train-wreck-voyeuristic-y, and abandoning them wasn't even an option. I can't even begin to describe the plot of _Diary_. I fear I'd only muck it up. And, you know what, it looks like I've taken care of my review of _Geek Love_, too. 5 stars for that little twisted beauty. ...more I found this in a so-called open library. A public bookshelf where you can give or take books for free. As I read, I kept noticing little dots or lines penciled in beside the text. I got to wondering what they meant. Did they point out an interesting passage? Did indicate some text the reader didn't understand? For most of the book I was more intrigued by this mystery than by the book itself. Nevertheless, the last 20% of the book was unputdownable, so that more or less makes up for the slow start. I found this in a so-called open library.

I would even say that this is even better than Fight Club. A dark gripping tale of an artist doomed because of her oozing lava of talents. Misty Kleinman Wilmot, you are cursed with that gift that you have for\u2014eternity. As a girl, being raised by a hippie mother, Misty never experienced what world is like outside the trailer park in Tecumseh Lake. That dream of being an artist is what Misty was living for. She weny to art school. In there, she met Peter Wilmot. The biggest mistake of all the mistakes she ever made in her life. Poor Misty. Gifted. Cursed. Inspiring. Peter Wilmot was on a mission to find that woman cursed with talent that will provide salvation to Waytansea Island. Yes, he was successful. The name \"Misty Kleinman\" was hyphenated with Wilmot. He soon tried to get Misty to Waytansea Island\u2014the island populated with lunatics. The island trapped with traditions. In order to get Misty to the Island, he impregnated her. Tabbi Wilmot was the result, and Misty staying in the island. I meant trapped . Better word\u2014wrapped. Being promised that her dreams of being an artist would be made into reality, she lived in that island as a waitress at a hotel the Wilmots owned. A mother. A queen of fucking slaves. For some reason, Peter attempted to kill himself. He failed. Peter had become a living dead in the hospital. A vegetable waiting to rot\u2014was slow rotting. Then, together with Grace Wilmot, Misty raised Tabii. Suffering. Suffering. Suffering. A daily overdose of it brings her talent back from the dead. The sleeping volcano exploded. She started to paint like a schizophrenic overdosed with talents. With her eyes closed and Tabbi as her inspiration, she painted masterpieces of art that were known to be impossible. Misty had lost everything. Now, Tabbi and that dream of being an artist were the only things left for her\u2014what was left for her to do. And oblivious to almost everything, what awaited Misty was a conspiracy that happens every four generations that would kill hundreds of people. An event that would make the island filthy rich for generations at a price of hundreds of lives. Misty Kleinman Wilmot. A queen of fucking slaves. A hostage who was destined to save the island from running out of money for the next four generations. A tool to use. The island that trapped itself with its own cycle. Once you are born, you're already doomed to fulfill your fate. You're doomed at being you. How can not being you and being you be curse at the same time? ... Life perhaps is... A cursed gift. A fucked-up life is the main reason why we great art ever existed. How stupid would be a painting of two unicorns kissing each other compared to a painting of a sky burning like hell with angels crying and screaming from wounds inflicted by demons, winged beings falling down from the great red sky. How stupid would that be if you call Justin Beiber's songs \u201cArt.\u201d Ok. Ok. I'll stop making fun of her. Suffering ... is the key in creating exceptional art. What hurts us the most awakes the artist inside of us. Brings out the genius out of our brains, out of our souls. Scars and wounds are the best source inspiration. You art shows your wounds your scars your life\u2014it shows everything about you. Art and Suffering\u2014they're almost synonymous. Do you know that the best artists are not the finest and perfect human beings? Chuck Palahniuk's Angsty Nihilistic Existential Voice was never this loud. Cynical and in some sense, optimistic. The plot build-up flares with excitement and disgust. Not to mention that this book has the best plot twists ever. Whoever the narrator was (probably it's Misty), it still continues to be a puzzle. Which is one the things I liked best about this novel. One of the best reads I ever had. To not read this would be a crime against yourself. You don't know what you're missing. And just for the record, you've already missed enough things in your life. ...more My summary of opinions of this book? So young! So angry!

I'll bet Chuck's airbags went off after this book, but I think it's possible that it's just a fender bender. I think a lot of Palahniuk's work is like a drunk guy shooting arrows at a bunch of children lined up against a wall with apples on their heads. Will he split the apple occasionally? You bet! But he'll make a gigantic mess doing it. So, enough stalling. I did like this book. I saw it in an airport on the way to Miami, looked it up online, and saw divergent opinions, so I picked it up. I absolutely do not see this as a horror story, so whoever had that idea needs to be slapped around a bit, but I enjoyed enough of it where I could suggest it to a couple of people. I liked the continuing discovery of the hidden messages as the book went on, and I also liked the slowly-revealed courthship that you see, too: the last time I saw a family like this that has lost its prestige yet still clings to a name (or island, here) was in James Mitchener's \"Chesapeake\". I know people like this. It's a perfect match, and described very well, in Palahniuk's signature style. I'd almost like to see him tackle something from life like that, because I think he's be able to grab people and get them reading history. Ah, but the flaws. Some of this is just absurd. I don't like people that bury themself in foolishness just to spring themselves with a ridiculous twist or plot device. In that way, I thought we got a little \"Left Behind\" going on, and that is by no means a compliment. Also, the fire at the end? is that the resolution? There's cliches a plenty here, especially if I could find a way to put the accent marks over the word as I type. I don't know. I suspect that Chuck is turning into the literary equivalent of Dane Cook: a master at marketing himself to a core audience that will eagerly buy what he is selling, and he has occasional flashes of brilliance, but at the core, he's mediocre. Dane Cook has just about exhausted his 15 minutes. Is Palahniuk also a one-trick pony, albeit one greatly assisted by and indebted to David Fincher, Brad Pitt, and Edward Norton? ...more I think Palahniuk is a lot like Vonnegut (and some might disagree with me here). He is an absurdist. He takes serious issues (like class and love and why is art always schtick) and mocks our human nature to exploit everything for our own pleasure in a serious tone but in a totally ridiculous way. Many people read Palahniuk's stuff and are disgusted and/or horrified. I laugh. Seriously, I think he is one of the funniest guys around.

It is not quite laugh-out-loud, but definitely chuckle under my breath. Unfortunately, I was a bit under-whelmed with Diary. Misty's style of repetition (while effective at making her point) was a bit annoying. I thought her weather reports were kind of cute, but the constant reminder that \"what you don't understand you can make mean anything\" was a bit over the top. My favorite quote in the whole book was: \"It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace\" and this is true..to an extent. I think that people do repeat their mistakes and (in fact) the irony lies in this statement. Misty makes it because she laments not appreciating her happy days in full. However, the islanders are on their quest for a new artist BECAUSE they remember their happy days so well and want to get back to them. The book itself is short, but I did find it slightly tedious and it took me way too long to read (although lots was going on here making it difficult to sneak away with my book the past few days). Ultimately, it was a character piece about a place and that made it a bit less compelling. The whole \"plot twist\" at the end was a bit too hard to take, but certainly explained how Misty was able to paint the island before she ever saw it. Overall I am kind of ambivalent. There were parts I really enjoyed, but I did feel like it slogged. Recommended for those with odd/gross sense of humor and who like Palahniuk's other stuff. Not so much for everyone else. ...more Misty Wilmot was a promising young artist back in her youth.

Amidst all of this stress and turmoil, Misty\u2019s artistic talent comes roaring back. Soon Misty finds herself in the middle of a dangerous plot that could endanger many lives. Diary by Chuck Palahniuk is a suspenseful, darkly twisted read. I\u2019ve come to expect a certain level of disturbing and shocking content in a Chuck Palahniuk novel, enough to make me cringe but at the same time make it so I can\u2019t look away. Diary definitely didn\u2019t let me down on that front! Palahniuk paints a vivid picture of his characters and the setting, but he often chooses to describe these things based on their flaws and ugliness. I thought this was a very interesting and truly Palahniuk approach to thing. One of the things I love most about Chuck Palahniuk books is that he always includes really random and fascinating bits of information in his novels. Due to the art theme woven into the plot of Diary, the tidbits of information are all revolving around art, artists, and my personal favorite, the different ingredients in different shades of paint. You\u2019d be really surprised what\u2019s in some of it. The plot of Diary felt different from the other Palahniuk novels I\u2019ve read. It had a suspenseful, almost mystery novel feel to it, but done in a unique way that is true to the author\u2019s nihilistic, unsettling style. While I did predict some of the aspects of the plot, I was still surprised by the majority of events taking place. Things weave together at the end in a much more complex, solid fashion than I would have expected. I was truly creeped out by the events taking place, probably because even though it\u2019s unrealistic to think that people would actually stoop to the level of the characters in this novel, I could sort of see a bunch of greedy, disturbed people pulling something this horrifying. Even though Palahniuk\u2019s novels are bizarre and hard to believe at times, they aren\u2019t completely out of the realm of possibility. For readers looking to step outside their comfort zone and try something new, I highly recommend Diary by Chuck Palahniuk. It was a fantastic read! ...more La novela funciona.

Aku fikir novel ini juga bersifat sinikal kepada pengusaha industri pelancongan khususnya di pulau-pulau yang seharusnya tak perlu dicemari oleh unsur komersial akibatnya atmosfera pulau yang sebelumnya telus mula dihadang oleh lambakan objek legap seperti papan-papan iklan komersial yang merosakkan pemandangan. Manakala penduduk asal pulau yang asalnya tuan di bumi sendiri kemudiannya menjadi hamba komersial dengan bekerja di hotel dan restoran secara tak langsung menjadi golongan berkasta rendah kepada pelancong luar.

So, basically the review (at the back cover) has ruined my imagination and make this book pretty predictable, and another point by me, i do not really like the end of the story, sort of an anti-climax, a typical Hollywood ending.

In many cases, authors who write to imbue confusion in the reader do so at the expense of narrative cohesion. Diary's success lies in the fact that it disorients the reader, but can describe in parallel separate lives and disparate events as part of a cohesive narrative thread, while maintaining the uniqueness and economy of prose that Palahniuk brings to all his books. That said, Diary is not a book for the faint of heart. Palahniuk's oft-schizophrenic prose imbues the reader's mind with unsettling, and often frightening imagery and emotion as he digs into the familiar territory of identity and its social constructs through some very interesting narrative conceits. Of course, it takes two to three readings to fully explore the depth of Diary, a classic trait of Palahniuk's books. While Diary does not live up to the standard of Fight Club, it is certainly a book worthy of attention for the seasoned Palahniuk fan. ...more Palahniuk, Palahniuk, Palahniuk... Well, well, well.

The thing that irked me the most was the story really - a young, trailer trash girl marries a guy from art school, he whisks her away to his island (she thinking it was the sort of idyllic place that little trailer trash girls dream about) and a good 20 years later, the guy is in a coma and she has all this hatred against him that she decides to chronicle in a \"coma diary\"; hatred of the island itself, the people on the island, her situation, the fact that she didn't become a famous painter and on and on.
