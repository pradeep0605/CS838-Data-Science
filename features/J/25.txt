But the women he comes to marry is anything but reliable. (She's also a faithless scheming bitch, but more on that later.) Catherine Land is a woman with a plan and a mission. She is to marry Ralph Truitt, then slowly poison him until he dies and she becomes sole possessor of all his possessions. After this she will reconnect with her lover, Tony Moretti. But Tony Moretti is actually Antonio Truitt, Ralph's non-biological son. (Sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it?) Catherine and Antonio (or Tony, whichever you prefer) set all of this up. You see, when Catherine saw Ralph's ad in the paper and showed it to Antonio it raised all of his old hatred for his father. He saw his father's loneliness as the perfect why to not only get back at his father but also to kill him. All he had to do was get Catherine to do his dirty work. So, Catherine marries Ralph and soon after she is sent by Ralph to get his son back. Ironic, yes, but Ralph wants to make things up to his son and try to undo his wrongs. (Also, the author is trying to incorporate twists into this sex-filled mess called a novel.) As you can imagine, when Catherine goes to get Antonio lots of fun adultery ensues. But Antonio is also angry that Ralph isn't dead yet. So, Catherine returns to Ralph without his son and then the poisoning commences. <+++>A Reliable Wife</+++> could've just as easily been titled The Misadventures of Harlots. Everyone has sex on the brain 24/7/365. And if they aren't thinking about sex, they're having it. It truly never ends! And none of it is sex y , either: there is adultery, rape, and even talk of sex with an unconscious partner. I don't know about you, but none of that interests me. Catherine is probably one of the most deplorable characters I've ever read about. Among many other blunders that I won't bore you with, she deludes herself into thinking that Antonio loves her when he's clearly only using her as a means to kill his father. Somewhere around page 140 I began to skim the hell out of this. I quickly grew tired of the endless talk of the characters getting high on opium and morphine in both their past and present and the minutiae of their endless sexual excursions and reminiscence. The very fact that this is a #1 New York Times bestseller just reaffirms my belief that that list is crap and there's a lot of people who will forever love trash. ...more Halfway through this book, sick of every character having a wanton, unquenchable libido, I wanted to shout at Goolrick, \"If you want some that bad, get some and then come back to the story.\" It wasn't raunchy or descriptive or anything like that.

It was just an undertone that tainted the novel with an erotic feel. I didn't question one lustful character with a history of excessive sleeping around, but every single one was a bit much. I will give Goolrick credit that despite this being historical fiction and my distrust of modern authors to capture the right attitude of sex in historical fiction, I found myself believing all these characters in the shady side of town. I think Goolrick got the flavor of the era right. The characters were a little too much European-flavored tragic, but I liked that nobody was perfect and I didn't know if good or evil would prevail in them. While Goolrick has some beautiful, poetic moments with his writing, he relies on them too heavily to tell his story instead of just telling the story. The number one rule in writing: show don't tell. I offer <+++>A Reliable Wife</+++> as exhibit A on why that rule exists. I trudged through the backstory in the first few chapters waiting for it to pick up, but even as the story took turns I didn't expect, I wasn't given actual scenes, only summaries of events and what the characters felt and what we were supposed to take away from it. When the story veered back from St. Louis I was sure Goolrick was finally going to show us something, but no. He kept on this summary and analyzation through the end of the book. The most annoying of these is the incident with the Larsens. Pretty integral characters and a rather alarming twist that is written off in a side note without much explanation. There's a whole lot of crazies going on in this small Wisconsin town that aren't really elaborated on. At the core of the novel is a great story. I can't even tell you what it's about because it unfolds like an onion from chapter to chapter. All I can say is it starts with a woman who answers an ad in the paper for a spouse from a lonely Midwestern man, but why she answers the letter or why he sends it out is something you'll have to find out for yourself. Even when you think you know who the characters are and what they are out to achieve, they surprise you. It makes for a book you don't want to put down, even if the writing is a struggle to get through. I would love to see this done in a movie, if it were produced right. ...more Even though I have alredy sent this, I am updating for my Best of 2009 list: This was a terrific novel with the gothic feel of past novels such as REBECCA and the recent THIRTEENTH TALE.

There was no particular reason to read each sentence ( although I did, dutifully) Once something got established it was repeated in a way that reminded me of the Lutheran masses of my childhood; the minister would repeat the sentences with slight variations, it was a style appropriate for the ecclesial layout of a point; the device had a hypnotic quality. Here I found myself turning the pages listlessly, unengaged; there was no food there. There are a million references to sex, but no heat, no heartbeat, no actual physical or emotional happenings; just insipid formalistic cataloguing of references.

I was surprised at some of the twists and turns the story took and I have to say I was pleasantly misled into thinking I knew what was going on. This is one of those stories that I know will stay with me for a long time, but also one I'm not sure I could reread. Ralph Truitt places an ad for a \"reliable wife\" in the classifieds and Catherine Land answers. He speaks to her through letters and she sends a picture and he in turn sends her a train ticket to come live with him as his wife. When she arrives she looks nothing like the picture she sent and he realizes that the woman he has brought into his life is not what she seems. But then, neither is Ralph Truitt. His past is dark and his future is uncertain - will he ever find love or any kind of release from the tedium of his life? I enjoyed this book immensely, but this story was like driving past a car crash that you have to slow down and stare at, hoping to see something gruesome. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down and I had to know what was going to happen with the characters. Sex, love, insanity, and death are all major themes of this novel and I think the author did a fantastic job of weaving them throughout the story. I loved the way Catherine was portrayed; she likes sex, money, reading, flowers, and good food. She's very complex and hard to read at first, but the more you get of her story, the easier it is to relate to her. I thought she was both weak and strong, loving and conniving, and an incredibly well-developed character. She struggled with her sense of self and what she thought she deserved throughout the novel. She's unique, but she's also \"every woman.\" Ralph on the other hand, I liked from the start, even though I don't think I was supposed to. I don't think it helped that I imagined a slightly older Clive Owen when I thought of him. Ralph had a hard life, but his main problem is he blames himself over everything bad that had happened to him. From an early age he's made to believe that he's a wicked child that will grow into a wicked man, his veins filled with a poison that will kill anything he touches. It's not until he meets Catherine, who is both a cause and relief for his pain, that he truly feels he has the right to be loved and live a full life. Now, there's a whole other half to this novel that I can't even discuss without spoiling the surprise. Maybe I'm dense but I didn't see the twist coming. Even up to the last page I wasn't sure how things would end, and I was again surprised at how they did. The ending was satisfying and just about perfect. I look forward to reading more by this author and I hope he gets going on his next novel! ...more Cuando terminas de leer un libro como \u00e9ste, no puedes dejar de preguntarte c\u00f3mo puedes transmitir todo lo que sientes, en unas pocas palabras.

The parts in St. Louis after Catherine Land found Truitt's son dragged on for me. But then after she got back, the storyline began to soar again. I don't know: I think it was the son that ruined everything for me. I know he was supposed to be with fault and unlikeable, but I really just didn't see him as a fleshed out character. He was this caricature of what a lost, bitter son was supposed to be...and he was boring because of this. Had Goolrick focused less on him, there would have been less action, yes. But the development and evolution of Truitt and Land's relationship held enough tension and suspense in and of itself that it could have been its own book without these other distractions. So I guess in the end I say two stars whenever the son's around, and five for the rest. ...more The story had potential, even though it's been done a hundred times.

It took an immense amount of discipline not to fast forward through every other chapter. (If I had read the book versus listened to the audio book, I would have skimmed through pages at a time.) It seemed like the author added pointless storylines to the plot just to pack pages. Nothing but fluff. I also found the characters weak, boring, and annoying. The three main characters were borderline nymphomaniacs, which got a little monotonous. I'm not disputing the fact that the story required a bit of sex, but really, if I had a nickel for every time the author used the word \"desire,\" I'd have a damn lot of money. Next, please! Bottom line: boring, boring, boring. I'm being very generous by giving this book two stars. I can't believe NPR recommended this book--I guess there's no accounting for taste. Koz, if this book is on your to-read list, I suggest you remove it.

Needless to say, sex that makes me wonder about the author's life rather than about the characters, is sex that does not serve the story. The characters were insipid, unrealistic, and Goolrick babbled on endlessly about the goings on inside their minds in the MOST annoying way. Can anyone believe, for example, that a six year old boy stabbed in the hand with a needle, by his mother (down to the bone, mind you) does not cry, does not scream, does not even say anything? It's ridiculous. Goolrick also has one of those authorial tics that makes me want to scream. Everything happens in a series of three. For example--she walked down to the pond and the ice was still frozen and the air was clear and the wind did not blow. Page after page, every description, a series of three. I don't know if this is his attempt to create drama, or a sense of urgency, or if he just thinks it sounds artistic.

I bring this up again because the author insists on throwing it in your face every other page or so, and also because this is how everyone relates to one another.

But that isn\u2019t much of a story, so he invents a former lover who is really the man\u2019s estranged son, so they are both plotting. But then the author is forced to make it more complicated and it fell apart for me. Why is the son estranged? Oh, the author makes him think his dad killed his mother. Oh, so now we have to invent a dead first wife. The whole thing becomes unbelievable. This is a man who obsesses about trains being on time, has private detectives spend ten years looking for his son, and he doesn\u2019t bother to have them spend ten minutes investigating the woman he has sent for??? I mean, this isn\u2019t some country yokel ordering a wife. Oh, but I forget, if he had investigated the woman there wouldn\u2019t have been a story. And then the author wouldn\u2019t have made piles of money by having book clubs like mine read this stupid book. Antonio is a cardboard figure. We are mostly told he was like a child. That\u2019s about it. Where do the clothes come from? Is he a gigolo? Does he really afford the clothes he wears by playing piano in a whorehouse? And Antonio and Catherine\u2014By not getting inside their heads in the restaurant scene the author misses a chance to show us something more psychologically interesting about them, but he doesn\u2019t let us know at that point that they were lovers because he wants to surprise us (surprise! surprise!) when she shows up at his house. Antonio is described, but we get almost no insight into him except he hates his father because he beat him and because he thinks his father killed his mother. And likes sex with Catherine. And Emilia. Totally unbelievable. OK, she is a gold-digger. \u201cSuch things happen.\u201d But presumably she is a well-brought up impoverished, aristocratic, Italian Catholic gold-digger. Surely she knows where her bread is buttered. And she runs off with a piano teacher?? Really? And the Larsens. Good solid people about which we are told almost nothing, and then suddenly Mr. Larsen chops his hand off because his wife doesn\u2019t want him touching her. Where on earth did that come from?? There are a one or two interesting things about the book. The idea that Truitt is so besotted with Catherine that he would allow her to poison him is one. Why? Is he just so besotted with her that he would let her do anything? What is the difference between lust and love? This is all just skimmed over. The plot complication that Catherine finally starts to poison Truitt because Antonio is basically blackmailing her is a nice touch, and here the author develops Catherine\u2019s feelings more than he does elsewhere. It is finally here that she is faced with making a real moral choice\u2014protect herself or save Truitt. But she knows that Antonio is really a creep and would throw her over as soon as he got the house and money, so what is she to do? I think this could have been a good book if the author had cut out a hundred pages of repetition and showed us more of the characters, rather than just telling us everything. Can you imagine how Edith Wharton might have handled this plot? There is so much more the author could have developed. Why are there so many crazy local people\u2014including Mr. Larsen? Again, he tells us what happens, he doesn\u2019t show us anything interesting leading up to it. Is it just the isolation? The religion? I assume from the names that most of the local people are Scandinavian Lutheran immigrants. Does this affect them? The author develops the religious angle with Truitt\u2019s crazy religious mother and her influence on him, but he could have done more with this. What about the difference in religion between Emilia and Truitt? We know from the get-go that there is going to be a happy ending to all this, because, after all, that is the sort of book this is. So, to have a happy ending the author has to kill off Antonio, who could spoil everything, and then have Truitt forgive Catherine. Therefore he has Truitt, a middle-aged, out-of-shape man who has just gotten over being confined to bed with poison sickness AND been hit over the head with a poker able to chase down Antonio, who conveniently falls through the ice and drowns. But THIS is what SHOULD have happened to the characters: Because Catherine refuses to poison Truitt Antonio makes good on his threat and sends Truitt a letter telling him that Catherine was a prostitute (but leaving out that they had been lovers). Catherine, not thinking that Truitt might already know this and forgive her, poisons HERSELF. Antonio runs off to Italy, finds out his Italian grandparents have no money, becomes a highly paid gigolo to middle-aged American women in Rome and dies in an opium haze. In his grief, Truitt allows his business to go bankrupt and lives out his life in loneliness and poverty, slowly selling off the furniture in the fake Italian mansion bit by bit, looked after by the loyal Mrs. Larsen, who now has mostly only potatoes to cook. Good riddance to them all. ...more This book, the #1 IndieNext list pick for April 2009, is an infinite loop of love turning to hate and hate turning to love and what all that kinetic passion does to the people who experience it.

Both of these people have dark histories that they are trying to forget--or are they? They are strangers to each other--or are they? All that is true in this book is that nothing is quite as it seems. Ulterior motives abound. Yet, in a strange and twisted way, it basically ends in a version of \"and they lived happily ever after\". Don't worry--that isn't really a spoiler. It's a long and crooked path to get to that ending, with many Victorian flourishes along the way. ...more A Reliable Wife, by Robert Goolrick, is the story of how Catherine Land answers a rather pathetic sounding classified ad placed by a lonely, tormented rich man.

From the beginning of her correspondence with him, Catherine is up to no good at all: she plans on slowly poisoning Ralph Truitt and having his fortune for herself. Automatically, I expected this tale to turn into one of those beautiful, gradual love stories in which Catherine falls in love with Ralph and realizes the dream of having both love and money in her life. However, the story involves other people who make the plot more complicated, but not more interesting. In other words, I'm not raving about this book. I found the writing style to be incongruent with the time period, which was just after the turn of the century (1908), and I felt that the characters were not very fleshed out. Their past lives were told in a quick, glancing way, while the flowers Catherine loved so much were described in lush detail. There is a climatic scene near the end that seems to drag on and on, and just before the too-happy ending, the author actually beats into the reader what this story has been all about. Just in case she missed it. One of the themes of Goolrick's book is that life in Wisconsin was harsh for most people back then, and people went mad and did insane things. This is true, but parts of this tale seemed either too unlikely or not explained well enough. Goolrick also commits repetition of information, which I found to be very annoying, besides being a detriment to the movement of the story. I feel so weird for panning this book! It's not that Robert Goolrick is a bad writer, it's that this particular story was executed poorly. Despite its flaws, I did not have trouble finishing it, but I did wince as I did so. This is my humble opinion after hearing such good things about this book. So don't throw tomatoes at me! ...more In a word: horrible. It's been awhile since I read a book this bad.

The rest of the story is filled with wordy sentences, rambling narratives, stumbling dialogue, plot inconsistencies and one-dimensional characters so undeveloped and uninteresting as to almost be stale. And sex. Lots of sex. This is a lurid romance trying to pass itself off as literary fiction. There's no mystery here, there's no drama here, no thrills or suspense, no passion or intrigue. Worst of all, there's no story here. I've read bad books before, and A Reliable Wife will takes its well deserved spot on that list, but I've never been as bored reading a book in my life as I was with A Reliable Wife. Such things happen. I think A Reliable Wife started out as a short story, maybe a novella, and then someone suggested the author should add only another 100,000, or so, words to his short story and he'd have a complete novel. It's in those extra 100,000 extra words where the story really crashes. I'm not going to cite examples because, even though they're on every page of this overlong book, that would mean I'd have to go back and read those passages again and I have no plans on handling A Reliable Wife again until I try and sell it at the used bookstore. I hope they have a new employee working that day. The best thing about A Reliable Wife from my perspective is that if this book can get published then there's hope for anyone who enjoys writing to eventually see their work in print so keep writing! ...more A decent, engrossing read, but it's really not anything unique.

If you're acquainted with any of these works, you'll be in familiar territory here. Just cutting to the chase - the storyline is predictable and the ending a little unsettled. It's not wholly without merit, however. Goolrick's prose is very vivid, but somewhat repetitious at times, and I found myself skimming a little too frequently. There are no admirable characters here to identify with & care about, so the overall feel of this book is one of voyeurism; watching them wreak havoc on each other & generally make a muck of their lives, and the ending more a trailing off, or closing of the curtain, than a resolution. I gave it a B-. ...more 2 stars: \"It was okay.\" Well written, but I wanted more gothic trappings--more twists and turns, more creaking stairwells, more sinister secrets--but instead, this book is largely about a middle-aged man ruminating on sex. And the last thing the world needs is another book about an aging white dude's sex life! Wow. This story was really\u2026..different. I felt conflicted the whole time I was reading it. One minute enjoying it, the next not so much. I knew going into this that it was going to be a dark story. I had read a few reviews beforehand and knew that some people thought it was gratuitous and raunchy. Yeah. There is a HUGE sex theme running throughout the story. And I\u2019m not talking about sweet romance kinda lovin\u2019. It\u2019s raw, in your face, raunchy, and even creepy at times. I thought it was too much, Wow. This story was really\u2026..different.

And yet, I liked the brutal honesty of it. See...conflicted. And then there are the characters. To put it simply, these people are seriously messed up. I found the lives they led just crazy and hard to believe and didn\u2019t have a good opinion of any of them. And yet, there were moments when I felt myself rooting for them and felt tinges of sympathy. Again\u2026conflicted. The writing is raw and honest and for the most part I really enjoyed it. It does get repetitive at times when the author is trying to drive home a point and that did get irritating sometimes. But overall, I was completely pulled into the story and thought Goolrick did a great job creating the atmosphere of the story and the characters. (Albeit dark and devoid of any happiness.) I had a hard time deciding what to rate this because of how conflicted I felt. I think 3 stars seems to fit best. It was an interesting story and kept me turning those pages. I really did have a hard time putting it down. But it\u2019s not anything I\u2019d read again and not something I\u2019d recommend to the masses. ...more I can't do it, y'all.

I struggled through 66 pages of repetitive, meandering, self-inflicted sifting through wretched disquietude (most of which was reliant upon how they were so horny & misunderstood), but I still couldn't care less about what happens to any of these people.

I figured if Sara Gruen was touting this book, it must be pretty good. Oh my, it was not what I expected. I have never read those \"dime a dozen\" romance novels whose covers feature a beautiful woman in a fancy period dress looking over her shoulder at a dark and broodingly handsome man, but I think I stumbled inadvertently into my first one! Simple plot,lots and lots of repetitive language which pretty much droned on and on after a while. The jacket blurb called it \"seductively suspenseful, filled with unexpected twists and turns\", so I hung in there waiting for something wonderfully original and twisty to happen...only it never did. I didn't feel that this book was based on any kind of reality. Not quite my cup of tea. I would give it 1 1/2 stars because I was able to make it through, but I was anticipating much more than there was. ...more I am so good at only reading when I have time but this time I stayed up all night, I did not want to put it down, I was captivated from the very beginning and that feeling never went away.

This week, though, as I needed a new book and nothing on my TBR bookshelf appealed to me, I remembered this book and decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did. Goolrick has an almost poetic way with the language and builds suspense beautifully in this, his first, novel. It is a very gothic tale. As I was reading it, for some reason I kept thinking of Edgar Allan Poe, and the poem of his that came to mind was Annabel Lee . Not that the stories that the poem and this novel tell are particularly related but the cadence of the language and the use of repetition struck me as being similar. The book also reminded me of younger (much younger) days when I used to devour the novels of Daphne du Maurier and the Bronte' sisters. This book would be right at home on a shelf with those ladies' works. The story begins in 1907 in Wisconsin during a viciously cold winter. Indeed, the action of the novel which runs through 1908 seems to always be in winter. It is always cold and miserable, but perhaps that is just a reflection of the characters' personalities. Ralph Truitt is a rich country businessman in Wisconsin. He has been a widower for 20 years. His life has been filled with family tragedy. For 20 years he has not felt the touch of a woman, and for 20 years, he has burned for such a touch. This book, you see, is not just a gothic novel, it is a thorough-going bodice-ripper! We are privy to all of Ralph's memories of his sexual history and his ongoing fantasies which burn with such smoldering desire that one almost expects the book to burst into flames! At long last, Ralph decides to take steps to end his loneliness. He advertises in several newspapers for a mail order bride. His ad requests \"a reliable wife. Compelled by practical not romantic reasons.\" But Ralph obviously is not just what his staid and discreetly worded ad implies. He receives several responses and from them chooses Catherine Land from St. Louis. He sends his private railroad car to bring her to him. In the dead of winter. Ah, but Catherine also is not exactly the person that she seems at first. Our two main characters are both playing roles, and it seems that one of those roles may lead to murder. I won't say more than that for you may wish to read this book and I don't want to spoil it for you. If you are up for a psychological thriller/bodice-ripper/tale of possible redemption, this might just be the book for you. It really is a beautifully written novel that maintains the tension throughout. It's also deliciously wicked. Much of its appeal, I think, comes from its strong sense of place - a Wisconsin where winter never seems to end and where those endless winters can drive people mad with loneliness, melancholia, and desire. Such things happen. ...more In upstate Wisconsin, Ralph Truitt is a very wealthy man, but a lonely one.

But neither has been entirely truthful and as their relationship develops their pasts will catch up to them. Talk about your gothic mystery! Betrayal, an abandoned mansion, a long-lost son, and the isolation of a Wisconsin winter are just the beginning. The characters employ duplicity, obfuscation, coercion, prevarication, and downright lies. The plot is full of passion and remorse. They rush head-long towards the cliff of despair and destruction, and turn to one another with tenderness and forgiveness (or is it merely acceptance?). I thought Goolrick did a pretty good job of revealing Catherine\u2019s back story and possible motivations. I was intrigued by this mysterious woman with her fine manners and obvious skills, yet warped psyche. I was a little disappointed in how the author revealed Truitt, however. I never really understood what drove him. Was it only guilt for past behavior? Was he so caught up in his ability to control and \u201ccreate\u201d that he could not give up? Was it love? And Antonio was little more than a caricature \u2013 an angry young man who never matured beyond the hedonistic stage. I was completely caught up in the story and surprised by more than one twist. I found myself wondering how on earth Goolrick was going to end this story, who would leave and who would stay, who might kill whom (for, clearly \u2013 to me, at least \u2013 they couldn\u2019t all live happily ever after). ...more Ralph Truitt is a lonely middle-aged man who's made his fortune in a small town in Wisconsin, America, but who is hounded by ghosts and past regrets. It is 1907 and he's at the train station, waiting in the snow for Catherine Land, a plain and simple woman who's answered his ad in the paper to be his wife. Only, Catherine Land, when she steps off the train, is clearly no plain and simple woman, although she's tried to disguise her beauty with a simple black dress.

Only, Catherine Land, when she steps off the train, is clearly no plain and simple woman, although she's tried to disguise her beauty with a simple black dress. Catherine has her own reasons for agreeing to marry Ralph Truitt, and in her bag is a little blue bottle full of poison: arsenic. But Ralph, too, has a story to tell and a purpose for wanting a reliable wife, one that leads them both to face themselves, their desires and their demons. This is one of those novels that proves that simple, uncluttered plots can work extraordinarily well, allowing you to focus on the characters, their growth as people, their changing motivations. In that regard, this is a very psychological novel: very light on plot, but very deep on what's going on in these people's heads. It is also a story of pain, and the effect your childhood can have on you throughout your life - each of the main characters in this novel (there are three) are led by the demons of their childhood: Truitt by his \u00fcber-religious mother who convinced her little boy that passion and desire were the devil's work and that, as he grew older, his sexual desire for others led to their deaths; Catherine by being orphaned, having to raise her younger sister by prostituting herself, only to have her sister despise her and turn to whoring with zeal until it killed her; and Truitt's \"son\" Antonio, Andy, who is clearly the product of his dead wife's affair with the Italian music teacher, who harbours a deep and bitter hatred for Truitt for crimes he believed Ralph committed against his mother, Emilia. It comes spilling out against a backdrop of life in this small Wisconson town where people go mad and brutally murder their loved ones. There is so much resentment and pain and regret in this novel, it bleeds through the lines and stains your hands as you read. In the life behind her, she would smoke cigarettes and drink liquor and take drugs and grab what she could get out of the sea of people around her. Men wrote her letters. They had seen her at the theatre, high up in a box, and they would write and she would answer. So delicate. She would find forgetfulness for an hour or a summer or a night with any one of them whose letter amused her, a man with blue eyes or green eyes or brown eyes, their faces so close, pleading for what she could not imagine, and eventually the tremor would pass and the luxurious beauty of it would fade and she would see only the stupidity and the foul odors and the hatefulness of her own heart, a hatefulness which told her every minute that the pleasure these people obviously found in these simple moments would be forever denied to her. And then she would move on. [p.69] While reading this book - and it's a quick read because the prose flows along so smoothly, and also it's not that long a novel - I was easily immersed in the lives of these people, but there was also a part of me that was standing back, looking over my shoulder with a skeptically-raised eyebrow, not entirely caught up in the story and whispering little comments in the back of my head (this happens quite frequently, unfortunately). The problem was that I wasn't involved as a reader, merely as a sensualist: I was told everything, and even manipulated to an extent, and certain senses were drawn out and toyed with, but I was forever watching from the sidelines, completely incidental and irrelevant. These kinds of stories always make me feel conflicted: on the one hand, I like to admire them for what they have achieved; but on the other, I am grumpy at not being able to participate as a reader. He told everything. He had never spoken of any of this to anyone, but he told Catherine, because she was going to become his wife. He felt he owed her at least an album of the past. He tried very hard not to pity himself. He never placed blame, or accepted it, nor did he ever shirk responsibility. He described to her the smell of jasmine in the air, the rustle of silk in a Florentine palazzo, the dust drifting from the ancient, ruined curtains, but told her without poetry, simply described these postcards from his past, and she took in the information as though she were reading quietly in a public library. [p.78] Which is much the way you end up reading the novel: through your senses, absorbing details and people, but not mentally engaging with any of it. This is fine when you're in the mood to be a passive audience, which I tried to do, but there were times when I struggled to just sit back, when I wanted to interpret and figure things out and learn from what I had observed, not simply be told it all. Speaking of figuring things out, there is meant to be a twist in this novel, but I found it very obvious and predictable, which meant I kept looking for a \"real\" twist and was left disappointed. There's only the one \"twist\", and while Goolrick did a good job of suppressing certain details until the right moment, the style of telling the story made that a bit of a moot effort. Everything pointed to it. It seemed at first a gross coincidence, but is certainly not one. After all, there's clearly a deeper reason for Catherine turning up as she does, with her bottle of poison, than simply being after Ralph's money. It's all there in her thoughts. Goolrick has striven to create atmosphere, using a snowy winter in a bleak town for much of the story (the rest taking place in a nearby city, St. Louis), and the true accounts of madness and violence that really did occur in Wisconsin in the late nineteenth century. (I had to look up Wisconsin because I had no idea whereabouts it is, and it wasn't quite where I pictured it - I thought it bordered Alberta or Saskatchewan, with that open prairie expanse feel to it, but it's actually further east, south of Lake Superior.) Unfortunately, I tended to forget it was winter, or it didn't seem important, and every time a detail about someone dropping their kid down a well to drown or something similar popped up, it would give me a start and I'd have to remember, what's the deal with that again? I didn't find the atmosphere effectively strong enough to really make an impression on me. But there were other things I loved about this book. I loved the atmosphere created between Catherine and Ralph, the sense of a tight thread straining between them, and Catherine's deeply conflicted soul. I loved the quality of the prose, and the dark shadows that lurked around the edges of every line. I loved the sense of anticipation, and futility, and doom, all the more so because hope is not all lost. I loved Ralph's willingness to let Catherine poison him, and how he saw her as a kind of deliverer and loved her for it. It's weird, but it worked. I loved the seediness of Catherine's true life, and how it is conveyed in such soft, almost beautiful prose - the contradiction is quite stirring. There's lots going on here, and you can either let it tell you a story and leave it at that, or you can delve a bit deeper and interact with it despite itself. That said, and while on the one hand I quite enjoyed the narrow focus of the novel and its spotlight on passion and manipulation, I finished it feeling somewhat empty and untouched. These aren't characters who will live on for me, or who will come to mind overmuch, mostly because they left me cold - I never got the chance to get to know them beyond the confines of their lines, I never got to see them except through their own or each others' eyes (or, really, the author's). And that was truly disappointing. ...more", "Title": "A Reliable Wife"},
