It was really fun to get into Four's head 2 years before he even meets Tris, because you get to see a different side of him. You get to see the scared boy from Abnegation struggling to break free from his faction and abusive father, and you see him grow into the man he is by the time Divergent begins.

This is going to be my face until the book is released: I really really enjoyed this! I am beginning to think I end up liking Novella collections more than the actual series they belong to And i fell in love with Four all over again Reading Four made me feel this weird feeling, That feeling you get when you watch your old photos or videos like. I was not prepared for this. There is nothing new.... Its more like behind the scenes. We get know that what Four was up to all along. like. how he discovered about the attack on abnegation.

It was good that it was not divergent all over again. We get to see his friendships with Zeak, Shauna and others. and his Hateship with Eric too. Four is one of my favourite character of all time. (forgetting the fact that allegiant ever happened). I loved him in divergent and same for this one. I got the same old feeling of liking him. In Allegiant Four's voice was too similar to Tris's and I disliked it. But here Four's voice sounded orignal. It really felt like it was HIM speaking. When i read divergent i felt that i was right there in the dauntless sector. This one also has that power to make you feel you are present right there. Last three scenes from Fours POV were the best parts of this book. First Jumper\u2014Tris Careful \u2014Tris You look good\u2014Tris When i closed this book all submerged feelings of Divergent came back on the surface all over again.

I can always re-read the books and novellas but I'm not ever going to read about Tris or Tobias in new adventures. I've loved this characters for so long. I've cherished them for so long. They both hold a place in my heart. It's been a year since I read Allegiant and I'm still sad and stunned about it. With these novellas a chapter just closed, I think. Tobias is one of the most incredible I can't help sobbing right now because I just realized that I've read about everything Divergent as of now. I can always re-read the books and novellas but I'm not ever going to read about Tris or Tobias in new adventures. I've loved this characters for so long. I've cherished them for so long. They both hold a place in my heart. It's been a year since I read Allegiant and I'm still sad and stunned about it. With these novellas a chapter just closed, I think. Tobias is one of the most incredible characters ever written. He's not just tough as nails, he's also sensitive and he's not just loving, he's caring. He is a character with a lot of shit in his past, I think we all know that. Despite that, he didn't let it pull him down. He grew past his problems and he became an amazing human being. In these novellas, we see his progress into being a human. He is hateful in the beginning, he doesn't crack a smile, he doesn't laugh, he doesn't love but we learn that in time he changes into someone with not just a past, but into someone who knows he's got a future. He is not a delusional character, he know who he is, he knows what he is and what he's about. He doesn't just stand by and watch everything go down in flames, he does something about it instead. Just like Allegiant, I loved loved loved the way Mrs. Roth presents us his mind. I love his point of view more than anything. I love his beliefs, and I love who he is and I love the fact that he is not afraid of being afraid. In the last novella, The Traitor , we see how he falls in love. How it's not just beauty that sings to him but also the personality, he falls in love out of the pure emotions that girl, Tris, triggers in him. He doesn't find her gorgeous, he finds her interesting. His first instinct isn't that of protection, he wants to push her until she breaks just so see how brave and tough she is. She is the first person he felt emotions towards to, and by that I don't mean friendly feelings. He learned to love. He and Tris learned to love each other, together. No, no, they didn't learn to love each other, they just loved each other more by loving one another. That's what it took for them to fall in love together, a brush of their hands, a gentle move.. This is love. At some point I'm going to grow so homesick of this series and I'll grab them and read them again because I just can't not love them as much as I do. ...more \"I look down at her.

Reading a novella entirely in his POV has made me all the more sure. I don't think it's Roth being unable to write a believable male POV. It's a narrative problem; she is incapable of changing style. Of course, we won't know for sure until her untitled duology comes out, but it's my verdict for now. What's there to talk about in this collection of short stories? The complete and utter pointlessness. We don't learn anything about Four the original series hasn't told us. He's selfless, a Tris carbon copy, yadda, yadda, yadda. We get the Midnight Sun treatment during romantic scenes between him and Tris. I don't know if it's an Abnegation thing, but his thoughts are far too clean for an 18-year-old boy. Uber Divergent fans will gobble this collection up like cake. For the casual reader, a.k.a me, it's a waste of time. ...more Me ha costado, de alguna manera, verme atrapado en la novela.

Yup that sums it up. This was just perfection . I couldn't be any more happy with this little skydive back into the Divergent world. I HAVE MISSED IT. I love Veronica Roth's books so, so much and Four was awesome. I mean just look at him. Isn't he so approachable?! Yes yes, of course. There's a collection of four (duh) short stories and the whole book comes to around 200-pages. SO not enough, if you want my opinion. I'm almost disappointed at how short some where. But anyway, let's break this down, shall we? Story #1: This was just perfection . I couldn't be any more happy with this little skydive back into the Divergent world. I HAVE MISSED IT. I love Veronica Roth's books so, so much and Four was awesome. I mean just look at him. Isn't he so approachable?! Yes yes, of course. There's a collection of four (duh) short stories and the whole book comes to around 200-pages. SO not enough, if you want my opinion. I'm almost disappointed at how short some where. But anyway, let's break this down, shall we? Story #1: The Transfer. I loved this one the most, I think. It really showed Four when he was Tobias...basically a kicked puppy and so little and cute. OMG HE WAS SO LITTLE AND SCARED. And just his longing for a better life and absolute resignation at being beaten by Marcus. This was probably the most powerfully written one. I wish it'd been longer. My only critique is...exactly HOW did Marcus make everyone basically forget he had a son? I mean, Four would've had to go to school...and it said people just ignored him. But seriously? NO ONE took an interest in him? Even Tris, curious little Tris, never knew much about him and definitely didn't recognise his face when Divergent kicks off. So weird. Story #2: The Initiate. This is when Tobias turns into Four. It's awesome. I love getting to know a smaller Shauna and Zeke too. Back in the good ol' days when the training made sense and wasn't run by Eric. Okay, though, I have to admit, Eric wasn't scary an intimidating enough. I thought he'd have more of a rivalry going with Four, but Eric is basically in the background. Story #3: The Son. Not really sure why it's called that? Because Four has an angry dark side. He's getting all tall and strong now. (No, I'm not swooning, why do you ask?) Bashing people up. Training to be a leader. I figure these aren't spoilers because we know them from Divergent. Obviously he doesn't become a leader, and you find out why. This one is fills in some backstory about Jeanine. Story #4: The Traitor. This one is actually WHEN Divergent's happening. It includes a lot of scenes we already know from Tris' POV. I have to admit this is my least favourite. I'd already read this stuff. I was just seeing it from Four's moody POV. I love Four, don't get me wrong, but his thoughts during a situation didn't seem altogether different from Tris'. Especially going through is fear landscape. And Tris didn't seem alive and off the paper to me. Which was sad. I love Tris too. But I DO understand Four's feelings for Tris better. He was crushing on her soooo early and she never knew it. Adorable. And also: Four sucks with girls. It's hilarious. His first date with a random Dauntless girl is like 5 minutes long and I laughed a lot. All in all? PEOPLES, I FREAKING LOVE VERONICA ROTH AND FOUR AND TRIS AND DIVERGENT. I love each book and this was perfection. I wanted to give it 4-stars because...you know, because of Four , but even though that would be hilarious: It gets five. It deserves it. ...more Yes, I know. I know what you\u2019re thinking: 3 stars? Really, Stepheny? You? The psychotic Divergent fangirl that turns into a squealing 13 year old every time Four\u2019s name is even mentioned? You\u2019re only giving this 3 stars? *sigh* I had to show some extreme self-control in this rating. Part of me wants to give it 5 stars just because.

The logical side of me that is trying to look at things objectively says otherwise. Here are the facts: this book gives us little to no new information. The little bit of new information we get is great for a fangirl, but just ok for your every day read. I guess I was expecting some more insight into Four\u2019s life prior to him meeting Tris. (You see what I did there, right? Right?) Anyway, we do get a couple stories that show us what his life was like and why he changed factions. But we already kind of knew it. It elaborated points already covered in the Divergent series. And it also gave us snippets of scenes from Divergent but from Four's perspective that made me giggle incessantly. If I've said it once I've said it a hundred times, Roth makes me relive my teenage awkward first love like no other author has done before her. If nothing else, this was an awesome guilty pleasure read! Sometimes you need these types of books just to fill a void you didn\u2019t know you had. Four can fill my void anytime Wait, what? For Divergent junkies like me, you will probably love it. For people who hate the series, avoid it like the plague. For people who enjoy the series and wouldn\u2019t mind a little indulgence- you might enjoy this as well. But just know this: there is nothing new and ground-breaking in this book. It\u2019s strictly entertainment value. ...more \" Maybe she and I are the same. \" VERONICA YOU'VE JUST OPENED A WOUND. This books wrecks every little part of me.

The Transfer - I wasn't that impressed when I first read this, but now I'm even less impressed after re-reading it. It was boring, even more the second time. So many words for so little happening :( . His dad beat him, he left Abnegation, he got the name Four. Know that! Next please! The Initiate - This also bored me to tears. The only interesting parts were the ones about Amar being a divergent (2 pages or so...) The Son - How did Four even considered that he could refuse both parts and still be safe? He is not in a position when he can just back out of it. He should have done his best to take the leadership position from Eric and try to pretend to be a pawn, but do the right thing. But, he's the same old, weak Tobias that had to lean on Tris to do anything right. I feel that he just ran away from both responsibilities... Also, his reunion with his mother was not that touching. The Traitor - This is the first book told in fast forward from Four's perspective. If you haven't read the first book in the series and are kinda confused about what is going on, don't be, this book was never meant for you. It was another way of the author to get more money from her fans. This brought nothing to the main story and I hated it. Tobias is still whiny and boring just like in Allegiant. Now I know that the only reason I liked Four was because Tris liked him.

And because of Four. I mean he was the only thing I could save of Titanic-vergent: a disaster of epic proportions. In this book we can read four (like the number) short stories and two scenes about TOBIAS EATON aka Four. We can read why he chose Dauntless, how he got his nickname and his badass full back tattoo and how we became the iniciates instructor.

I mean he was the only thing I could save of Titanic-vergent: a disaster of epic proportions. In this book we can read four (like the number) short stories and two scenes about TOBIAS EATON aka Four. We can read why he chose Dauntless, how he got his nickname and his badass full back tattoo and how we became the iniciates instructor. And also we can see when he meets Tris (DESTRUCTRIS) Miss Roth says that she started writing the original Divergent book focused on Four's perspective but she changed it because \"it wasn't the story I wanted to tell\" so later on she came up with this book after Allegiant as a spin-off. LIKE \"Look my fellow iniciates, read what could have been Divergent with a less annoying protagonist. You can tear your skin off after reading\" it's not because Theo is as good-looking as a Hersheys bar, it's more like FOUR is ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING CHARACTER. We can see how he was trained as dauntless, how he discovered the plan behind Dauntless and Edudite leaders and also we see how he behaved when he met Tris. So this book works as a prequel and also as an alternative point of view of the original plot in Divergent. By far more interesting than Tris perspective. Sad to see we have to read this as a spin-off because a third person perspective in Divergent would have been BETTER. A LOT. Still this collection is interesting and easy to read. JUST WHAT I WANTED. NOTE: Also if you are curious and you know -or read- about WE CAN BE MENDED - the short story that came up with Carve the mark and that takes place FIVE YEARS after the ending of Allegiant . I was curious so I spoiled myself and found out that (view spoiler) [ Four and Christina end up together like... WHAT? NO BITCH NO. She laughed of your nickname in the first book, man!. OK, not important but still. I DON'T SEE IT. NO. (hide spoiler) ] It's just weird. You kinda wished you never wanted to know. ********************************************* RESE\u00d1A EN ESPA\u00d1OL No se porque termin\u00e9 leyendo esto. Supongo que porque lo puse en el kindle hace tiempo y no estaba segura si valdr\u00eda la pena. Pero luego de leer ACOTAR y re\u00edrme por lo bajo de forma intensa, pens\u00e9 que leer algo corto y entretenido ser\u00eda buena idea. Y por eso estamos aqu\u00ed. Se que casi todos saben de qu\u00e9 va este libro y de d\u00f3nde proviene. Esa divertid\u00edsima saga que se llamaba Divergente . Resulta que despu\u00e9s de acabar de leerla por all\u00e1 en 2014 , poco despu\u00e9s la autora decidi\u00f3 sacar un libro compilando una serie de historias cortas contadas desde el punto de vista de Four (aka Cuatro aka Tob\u00edas Eaton) uno de los personajes de esta saga. Si alguien tambi\u00e9n se acuerda, cuando acab\u00e9 la trilog\u00eda, Cuatro fue DE LO POCO que se pod\u00eda salvar del naufragio. Y no es porque Theo James est\u00e9 TAN de buen ver como una tableta de Hersheys, es porque su personaje siempre aparent\u00f3 ser m\u00e1s interesante que la propia protagonista, la siempre hero\u00edna hist\u00e9rica e insoportable Tris Prior. Yo es que honestamente hab\u00eda olvidado que este libro exist\u00eda y me interes\u00f3 leerlo cuando sali\u00f3, pero por cosas de la vida lo le\u00ed ahora porque record\u00e9 adem\u00e1s que Four era INMENSAMENTE mejor que la protagonista. \u00bfSi era m\u00e1s interesante de lo que aparentaba? Bueno, fue corto y fue una buena idea. Este libro se compone de cuatro relatos y un par de escenas en el que conoceremos como era el jovencito Tob\u00edas Eaton cuando sale de su casa en Abnegaci\u00f3n , como decidi\u00f3 irse a la facci\u00f3n de los Osados y c\u00f3mo se gan\u00f3 el sobrenombre de Four. Aparte de presenciar el entrenamiento que tuvo como iniciado y posteriormente se convierte en el instructor de los novatos. Vemos como los ideales de la facci\u00f3n van cambiando y el asume el puesto de instructor y dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de dar clases\u00a0conoce a Tris aka Destructris. Seguramente nadie leer\u00e1 este libro si no se ha le\u00eddo previamente la saga Divergente. El detalle es que la se\u00f1orita siempre iluminada Veronica Roth cuenta al inicio de este libro que inicialmente TOBIAS/FOUR iba a ser qui\u00e9n contara la saga original (\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1!!!).Y es cuando dice algo as\u00ed como \" vale escribo esto para mis fans pero les cuento que no era la historia que quer\u00eda contar y por eso me arrepent\u00ed y escrib\u00ed\u00a0Divergente como es. Ahora les traigo este libro para que lloren sangre y vean lo que no pudo ser\" Y es un \"No pudo ser\" muy doloso porque mediante uno va leyendo los pensamientos de Four no es dif\u00edcil darse cuenta que es un personaje, si bien algo limitadillo, ten\u00eda MUCHO m\u00e1s potencial y miga que narrar Divergente desde la perspectiva de la inmaculada Beatrice. Conocer como le afectaba la ausencia de su madre, su colecci\u00f3n de objetos y la forma de ser de su padre y como le hab\u00edan criado para pensar como abnegado. Si lo pensamos bien y todo lo que sucede a Four y lo que va descubriendo cuando decide pasarse a Osad\u00eda , nos explica mucho de lo que sucede y desencadena los acontecimientos de la saga principal. El detalle es que leer esto es leer una versi\u00f3n alternativa que tambi\u00e9n es una precuela de la historia principal. Lo malo es que -al menos yo- me pareci\u00f3 que Four y su iniciaci\u00f3n y dem\u00e1s es mucho m\u00e1s interesante que la de Tris . El lector puede conocer por qu\u00e9 se dio el cambio en Osad\u00eda y porqu\u00e9 todo se volvi\u00f3 una competencia que forzaba a los iniciados a superar un nivel o ser\u00edan dejados sin facci\u00f3n o sea porque tantas carajadas suicidas de las que nos quejamos tanto en su momento. Tambi\u00e9n llegamos al punto de c\u00f3mo Four va conociendo lo que se avecina y trata de averiguar qu\u00e9 planea Erudici\u00f3n y adem\u00e1s presenciamos algunas escenas cuando ya conoce a Tris y c\u00f3mo lidia con la tarea de ser mentor. Todo esto es para llegar a la conclusion de que si el primer libro habr\u00eda sido narrado a dos voces o con una voz omnisciente podr\u00eda haber dado mucho m\u00e1s de s\u00ed. Pero habr\u00eda que reformular toda la trama, pero lo que podr\u00eda haber sido tambi\u00e9n mucho mejor. La escritura de Roth sigue siendo como es: poco descriptiva y muy al punto. Al final cuando uno esta terminando el libro no puede dejar de sentir un poco de nostalgia. Porque, en resumen, aunque no es lo m\u00e1s incre\u00edble del universo Four podr\u00eda haber sido mucho m\u00e1s en la saga original. Una pena que tengamos que verlo en una novela spin-off. En fin que cuando te enteras de que va WE CAN BE MENDED , o el peque\u00f1o relato 3.5 que sali\u00f3 como regalo con el \u00faltimo libro dela autora en la que narra que sucedi\u00f3 CINCO a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s del final de Allegiant (Leal) te quedas un poco WTF porque (view spoiler) [Tobias/Cuatro termina de novio de Christina WHAAAT (hide spoiler) ] es algo que muchos consideran que no era necesario. Me enter\u00e9 de esto pero por eso no s\u00e9 si llegue a leerlo. Le da\u00f1o el recuerdo de la saga a muchos. Y bueno que es una lectura amena y entretenida. Y Four lo vale. Personalmente yo quisiera ver el final de la saga en cine auque sea mal\u00edsima #PrayforAscendant [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more", "Title": "Four: A Divergent Story Collection"},
