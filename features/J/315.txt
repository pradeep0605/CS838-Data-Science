I found myself agreeing with all of his views and disagreeing with nearly all of the ways that he said things. Gone from this novel is the depth of characterization and the complexity of the absurdity of the situations. Here things mostly just happen, largely to characters that end up not mattering at all, almost entirely for reasons that are arbitrary. Coincidence is fine when it brings to a head a point or a revelation of character, but herein there is coincidence simply to move things forward (the greatest sin there is), and while a mystic refusal to answer questions can create a sense of deeper intellectual exploration, here it is simply a refusal to ask or answer the questions that could have been posed. As it is, these unanswered mysteries are simply just things that happen. In honesty, it is a novel worth reading, if you like these kind of novels, because it is funny and because it is fun (I enjoyed it all of the way through). The problem is that it is empty where it is trying to be full, leaving the reader, in the end, feeling likewise. ...more I did it all for Tanuki: Things I learned about myself whilst reading Tom Robbins' <+++>Villa Incognito</+++> 1.)

Well, Tom Robbins did not make up the story of the tanuki from scratch, but he did embellish on the Japanese legend. Robbins is one of those rare authors where I stop for a second and think, how the hell did he come up with this?! He is creative without being unbelievable. He writes as if you were having a direct conversation with him and not just merely reading a novel. He doesn't explain every detail immediately, and let's the pieces fall into place as the reader moves along. He is well-versed in current events, mythology, philosophy, and pop culture. In other words, he is a rarity. The plot jumps back and forth without being overly confusing. You have to trust that the loose ends will be tied up eventually, and it is worth the wait. Everything and everyone is connected, and what at first might seem like happenstance, turns out to be another fork in the road. Suspension of reality may be necessary while reading this novel, but at the time, it doesn't seem out of the ordinary. ...more This has been on my Good Reads shelf for a long time with a two-star rating because I didn't care for the plot or the book as a whole.

At about the half-way point, The beginning of Tom Robbins\u2019 Villa Incognito has all the hallmarks of a comedic fable. For fans of satire, the lovable but lascivious Tanuki \u2013 an ancient Japanese badger-like creature with an enormous scrotum and love for women and booze \u2013 ensnares the reader immediately. The story to come, however, is much vaster than one might imagine. Jumping back and forth in time, between countries, and between different characters, the plot thickens and raises many questions. At about the half-way point, the complicated relationships between characters start being revealed in titbits, making the read ever-more tantalizing. More than anything else, Tom Robbins demonstrates an almost unmatched power to create satire fit for belly-laughs and description that will evoke sighs, smiles and tears. Plot aside, every sentence is a delight to behold. Embedded in Robbins\u2019 story are several ethical messages relating to war, belief and pacifism. Specifically, the issue of a suffering patient\u2019s right to die with the aid of drugs such as heroine to relieve their pain is explored. As one character points out, why should we worry about a cancer patient\u2019s addiction to heroine when they are on a one-way road towards death? As a society, a pain-free exit from life is surely the most compassionate thing we could offer (absent a cure). But I regress. Villa Incognito is quirky, hilarious and beautiful. The exploration of the Laos culture is fascinating and amusing. All things are covered with equal measures of wisdom and humour. Villa Incognito truly is a work of art. ...more I really enjoy Tom Robbins very much, but this book just really fell flat with me.

It starts off brilliantly and as someone living in Japan who not only runs into pictures of Tanuki, sees them quite often scampering across the highway when driving but also has a statue of one right out front my door, this was right up my alley and something which immediately piqued my interest. Then, in typical Tom Robbins' style he introduces another story, seemingly unrelated at first glance, but of course you know he is going to weave them both together strand by strand. While he does this to marvellous effect in other books like Perfume Jitterbug (fantastic) and Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates (brilliantly hilarious), there is something about this narrative that just doesn't quite gel. Don't get me wrong, there are moments of brilliance and very witty comments but to my mind, and I might get sledged by serious Robbins' fans for saying this but.....this reads like a very promising FIRST DRAFT of a novel. It is very unpolished by his standards. If only he had done a little more work on it, it could have been great. Secondly, the story ends so abruptly. I felt like he was really building up the plot to take it somewhere special but the ending was rather anticlimactic I must say, in addition to my added frustration of arriving at the last page only to find that someone had torn it out! Yep, that's right. Went to the nearest English bookshop in Tokyo where I could find a copy and read the last page properly in peace. Someone messing with my 'wa' again, no doubt. I would still say this is worth reading but if you are new to Tom Robbins, definitely do not start here. Start with one of his greater earlier efforts. A big thank-you, nevertheless, to Larry for lending me his copy. Larry, no more tearing out of last pages of novels please! ...more With a heavy heart, I submit to you my least favorite Tom Robbins book.

Even the ending felt like \"meh, my fingers are tired from typing so I'm just going to say 'the world is a crazy place' and then just end it\". There wasn't much resolution, even though the stories were \"wrapped up\" in a sense but it felt very abrupt. It also didn't help that I recently read his collection of magazine articles and short stories (Wild Geese Flying Backward) which covered a range of topics -- all of which seemed to turn up in this story. Maybe he was pulling from old notes or just couldn't help himself about waxing philosophical yet again about tomato sandwiches on Wonder bread? But it just felt a little \"been there, done that\". And instead of ever having that Official Tom Robbins moment where he pontificates about the wonders of the world (think the undergound people in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues), he seems to have written himself as a character in the story who is blustery and yet not enjoyable. ...more I think I liked this one in pieces more than I liked the whole. It struck me as less bizarre than some Robbins work, but still strange enough. I particularly liked the myth sections. However, at some point it just felt like it got done without finishing going anywhere. It managed to wrap up well enough, but I wanted something more. I think that was the difference between being one of the good Robbins books and one of the great Robbins books. I got this book for 99p when I was working at Waterstones. Absolute bargain. A real hidden gem of a writer. From what I gather, he just starts writing without any idea of where he's going and then sits back and sees where the story takes him. This one takes him to some odd places, but they're all worth going to.

The book is alive with the metaphysical presence of Japanese raccoon dogs, Asian harlots, dropout fighter pilots, muddled CIA agents, cute changes of season, circus clowns and chrysanthemums. The story? It seems these three fighter pilots crash in the jungles of Southeast Asia during a bombing raid late in the Vietnam War. They\u2019re captured and sequestered in a series of villages on either side of Indochina borders. The villagers are supposed to hold them prisoner but in the end they welcome the trio and allow the Americans to become dealers in their greatest product... cocaine. The three men end up into the most remote village of all; they take over an ancient edifice, which sits on the opposite side of a vast chasm. They make it their own and christen it Villa Incognito. There, two of the men, (Mars Albert Stubblefield and Dickie Goldwire) meet and fall in love with a young woman name Ko Ko, AKA Madam Lisa Ko. Lisa actually turns out to be the daughter of the archetype of all mythical Japanese raccoon dogs, the animal ancestor, Tanuki, himself. The men shared Ko Ko, (along with many other concubines who come willingly to the villa to learn English, philosophy, and whatever other wisdom the three Americans gladly impart.) Both Stubblefield and Goldwire fall in love with Lisa, though, in the end, it\u2019s Goldwire who asks her to marry him. She says, \u201cyes.\u201d More serious problems arise however. The third member of the team (Dern Foley) is discovered, disguised as a French Priest, selling drugs in Europe. He\u2019s arrested and returned to the US where Military Intelligence and the CIA are forced to struggle with the question of MIAs who, in fact, wish to remain missing in action even after the war ends and they can go home. It never enters the minds of the authorities that the reason for the defection actually has a lot to do with vine-ripened tomatoes. Foley\u2019s arrest sets off alarms in the minds of Stubblefield and Goldwire, as well as Foley\u2019s sisters Pru and Bootsie, and Madame Lisa Ko, who at the time of the arrest is traveling with her team of trained Tanukis as part of an American Circus. Robbins does three things really well. His research is deep and faultless... as anyone will learn if they Google the existence and mythological meaning of the species Tanuki. His humor is unfailing... as his extended discourse on the unparalleled virtues of mayonnaise with attest. His philosophical explorations of the God and universe are virtually Aristotelian. But it is his skills at storytelling that sets this book apart, and in the end Robbins wraps up the entire package as neatly as Charles Dickens might have done. There\u2019s not an untied knot anyway along the storyline. Very satisfying! There really needs to be a warning label on these books: Caution \u2013 reading Tom Robbins is addictive, abrupt cessation of reading will result in sudden and deep with drawl. But the books themselves can be very good for your soul, even if you don\u2019t believe you have one. ...more 3.5 Typical Tom Robbins - always a joy to read.

Very different characters and plot devices. ------------------ From Publishers Weekly Donald Barthelme once said, \"Those who never attempt the absurd never achieve the impossible.\" Robbins (Still Life with Woodpecker; Jitterbug Perfume; etc.) has made a career of attempting and achieving both, and in this, his eighth novel, he pulls it off again. Here we have weirdness personified, a quirky, outrageous concoction that is a joy to the imagination. The novel begins with the story of Tanuki, a badgerlike Asian creature with a reputation as a changeling and trickster and a fondness for sake. Also part of the cast is a beautiful young woman who may or may not have Tanuki's blood in her veins (but definitely does have a chrysanthemum seed embedded in the roof of her mouth), and three American MIAs who have chosen to remain in Laos long after the Vietnam War. Events are set in motion when one of the MIAs, dressed as a priest, is arrested with a cache of heroin taped to his body. In vintage Robbins style, the plot whirls every which way, as the author, writing with unrestrained glee, takes potshots at societal pillars: the military, big business and religions of all ilks. The language is eccentric, electrifying and true to the mark. A few examples: \"The afternoon passed more slowly than a walnut-sized kidney stone\"; \"He crooned the way a can of cheap dog food might croon if a can of cheap dog food had a voice\"; \"Dickie's heart felt suddenly like an iron piano with barbwire strings and scorpions for keys.\" While the ending is a bit of a letdown, this is delectable farce, full of tantalizing secrets and bizarre disguises.

These nefarious smart-asses are heroes, according to our author, who invests them and his narrative with mischievous, sexy, and subversive humor. Crisp-toned Barrett Whitener totally buys into the romp, unintimidated by the overrich vocabulary and mystical esoterica. He does an astonishing job impersonating the Asian characters. When the text runs out of steam near the end, he perks it up. Thanks to Whitener, staying tuned through the end is a pleasure. ...more This was my first experience reading Tom Robbins and undoubtedly I have found a new favourite author to add to the collection. I have never read anything quite so imaginative, thought provoking and hilarious in equal measures. Robbins' writing style is so unlike anything else I have read that I can't begin to describe it justly but it is simply inspiring - the closest I could come would be 'stream of conciousness yet with a penchant for metaphor and outrageousness'. The storyline is surprisingly This was my first experience reading Tom Robbins and undoubtedly I have found a new favourite author to add to the collection. I have never read anything quite so imaginative, thought provoking and hilarious in equal measures. Robbins' writing style is so unlike anything else I have read that I can't begin to describe it justly but it is simply inspiring - the closest I could come would be 'stream of conciousness yet with a penchant for metaphor and outrageousness'. The storyline is surprisingly engaging even though the far-fetchedness of it matters not a jot when it is so superbly written. The idea of combining Vietnam deserters, Japanese folklore and circa. 9/11 America will be inconceivable to anybody that hasn't read Villa Incognito - all I can say is read it, and marvel at how expertly Robbins weaves them together and the uproar he creates in doing so. The tiniest complaint I would make is that it ends rather abruptly and not on the spectacular bang I had anticipated. Some may deride 'Californication' as a crass low-quality TV show but this is exactly the kind of tale I would envisage a certain Hank Moody writing. Absolutely superb. ...more Holly Laycock (Tin House Marketing Intern): I started Villa Incognito by Tom Robbins after I finished In Cold Blood, and it is just the break from reality that I needed.

Some aspects and passages are among the best anywhere. But much of this makes no sense. I guess maybe it isn't supposed to, or that I'm missing the boat. Possible... In this story I was especially left behind by the flower seed in the girl's mouth. Huh? What is that supposed to be? I enjoyed the story of the animal that is a central character and symbol, the tanuki (a Japanese racoon, pretty much).

I know TR writes for Rolling Stone and other magazines. Maybe this idea would be better described in that forum. I have to say that in the book it was a distraction. ...more How is this novel classified wrt genre? I believe it's a Fantasy but, like many good Fantasies you will find it in the mainstream literature section of bookstores, along with Stephen King and other great authors. I wish I could write with half the skill of Tom Robbins. He is retired from writing now but it always took him a long time to write a short book. That's because he was soooo careful about the way he turned each phrase and how he used each word. I can read his novels as writing lessons f How is this novel classified wrt genre?

That's because he was soooo careful about the way he turned each phrase and how he used each word. I can read his novels as writing lessons for improving my own Fantasy writing or I can just kick back, relax, and enjoy. Villa Incognito is one of my favorite books by any author and, as a Fantasy, I am awed by Robinson's wild and wonderful imagination. He weaves the real world into his stories and that makes them come to life. ...more :-/ That's all I really got for this one. Robbins is so hit or miss for me. Two of his books are among my all-time most cherished, a few others I've really enjoyed, and another few . . . are not a good fit for me. Also, dude, could you maybe write at least one book that doesn't involve some gnarly, pompous philosopher seducing a Pretty Young Thing half his age and showing her the ways of the big wild world? That gets a little insulting. As does the unfailing appearance of the pretty protag who cu :-/ That's all I really got for this one. Robbins is so hit or miss for me.

Ain't nothing wrong with that in and of itself, but it comes off as an author preoccupation rather than a character asset, and it gets old. Will still never give up on you, Tom. ...more I started reading Tom Robbins because a friend is crazy about his work. I have only read this one and \"Still Life with Woodpecker\" (which I read twice, because it was that good). However, as much as I enjoyed the process of reading this book, and the author's almost juggler-like facility with language, at the end I was like \"Huh?\". Parts of the book were rants, other parts were needlessly stretched out bits of mythology about the tanuki.

His rambling, way out there blizzard stories and social satire is lst on the aged. I loved his books in college..devoured them, lost him around half asleep in frog pajamas..and didnt even try reading invalids.

I want so desperately for my brain to accept Tom Robbins and love him. But there's a disconnect. The story is okay, three MIA Americans, a mysterious (magical?) circus trainer, some Animal Gods/gods. Several threads of the narrative are left dangling, a few others are hastily tied up with 2 epilogues. The best thing about this book are the random one-liners sprinkled throughout. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not great. My desire to love Tom Robbins has been thwarted again.<---C>Tom Robbins</---C>", "Title": "Villa Incognito"},
