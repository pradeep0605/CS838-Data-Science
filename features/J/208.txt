D.D. seems like the type of woman who would wear thigh high leather boots, step in your ass crack with the stiletto heel and tell you what a bad boy, or girl, you've been. Not that I'm into that. And, also, not that there's anything wrong with being into that. An orgasm is an orgasm. Look! All I'm saying is I would totally do her. <+++>Hide</+++> picks up some time after Alone ended. Bobby Dodge is now working with the Massachusetts State Police after he killed a man in the last story, and is still dealing with all his malemotions (Trademarked 2016 by Me) because of it, when D.D. calls him from a crime scene at an abandoned mental hospital. Let's just say dead children and move on from this part of the review, shall we? \"My whole family disappeared... I can't afford to come back from the dead.\" Somehow tied to the mental hospital is Annabelle Granger. On the run with her parents since she was seven - a new town and new names every year due to her father's paranoid insistence that her life was in danger - Annabelle is listed as one of the dead children found on the mental hospital's grounds. The only problem is Annabelle is only dead on the inside (just like me. #kindredspirits) Her parents are legit dead though, their ashes hanging on a necklace around her neck (#creeeppppy) so she's never found out who or what she's been hiding from for 25 years. Living in Boston under a new name, she's forced into a decision: let everyone think she was one of the dead children, including her mystery threat - or come forward to the police, giving them a new lead that might potentially bring justice and closure to those who need it. Annabelle decides to do the right thing, which puts her in dangers as all the pieces of her past are revealed one by one until... You know how it goes. I like Gardner's writing style and character development, aside from Bobby's need to fuck the victims and the serious lack of scenes featuring D.D. The plot was intricate and revealed all the twisty-pretzel bits with perfect timing, and my feels took a direct hit when Annabelle's dog got stabbed and she fought for her life. Maybe I'm not so dead inside after all. I will be definitely be reading the next in the series, while hoping for a little more stiletto in my ass crack this time (metaphorically, of course.) ...more My, oh my!

Who killed those girls? Is he still out there somewhere killing other young girls? Bobby Dodge, still reeling from his last case as a Boston police sniper, is now a detective with the Massachusetts State Police. He receives a call from his old pal and ex-girlfriend, Sergeant D.D. Warren of Boston P.D. requesting his assistance on a case. Don\u2019t ask questions or listen to the police scanner. Just get here. STAT. What he sees in that chamber calls to mind another case and another victim. Has his worst nightmare returned? Annabelle Granger sees her name in the paper as one of the victims, and she knows she must go to the police. She has been on the run her whole life. When she was five, her father met her at the door with packed suitcases, and her family moved from Boston to Florida. They changed their names. This happened every few years. It happened so often that Annabelle was always looking over her shoulder. She never knew whom to trust. She didn\u2019t even know her real name. The strangest thing was that she didn\u2019t even know what they were running from. Annabelle, the name she identifies with most, decides to stay in Boston. It is the last stop after many moves. She has multiple locks on her doors. She has a dog. She practices martial arts. But who is she? She inserts herself into the case, feeling she has an invested interest. She was declared dead, after all. Bobby, as we learned in the first book, Alone, is susceptible to vulnerable, beautiful women who just happen to be central figures in his cases. Does this happen in real life? Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly adds a tinge of romantic tension to Ms. Gardner\u2019s fiction. Drama too, and that doesn\u2019t make D.D. happy. No siree. I found myself feeling a bit foggy on the details of that previous case, which is mentioned not infrequently in Hide. But there are enough reminders for it to make sense to me and enable me to connect the dots somewhat. That\u2019s not saying that I figured the whole thing out. Not by a long shot! I was constantly wondering what the heck Annabelle\u2019s father had them running from, or if perhaps he was really a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. The author did a fantastic job sowing seeds of doubt here, there, and everywhere. There are a number of characters that are bad guys, but none is THE bad guy. There are several red herrings, and even when I did consider the persons who were actually dangerous, I could never be sure, because there were so many twists. The bottom line: TRUST NO ONE. Annabelle is an enigma. She\u2019s been through a lot. She seems to not know who she is, and who can blame her? Yet, she functions. She runs her own home-based business. On the surface, she seems self-sufficient, but she is frightened and alone. Will she go it alone, or will she let herself trust Bobby? This book is billed as \u201cDetective D.D. Warren #2.\u201d There is much more of D.D. in this story than in book one, but it is still very much Bobby Dodge\u2019s show. This is Bobby\u2019s first case as a detective, and while he has a lot to learn, he has good instincts, other than letting himself have feelings for a woman who\u2019s a key part of the case. D.D. seems to be a hard-core cop. She\u2019s all business. I\u2019d like to know what\u2019s under that tough exterior. We know that she and Bobby tried and failed to have a relationship. I do like observing the interplay between Bobby and D.D. and the unease that lies beneath the surface of their interactions. I also found it interesting that Ms. Gardner chose to write Annabelle\u2019s chapters in first person and the police procedural sections in third person. I believe she deliberately sets Annabelle\u2019s experience apart from that of the detectives who are tasked with solving the case. Rather than finding this bothersome, I actually liked it; in fact, I hardly noticed it most of the time because it felt quite natural. So \u2013 how do I conclude this? I could go on and on, but I don\u2019t want to give away any more of the plot. Parts of it are a little bit over the top, but I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called fiction. I could rave for days about this book, but your time would be better spent reading the book! Seek out Hide. You won\u2019t be sorry! 5 stars ...more WARNING: not a review, more a rant.

I paused my audio to google whether real-life cops in Boston (or anywhere) wore stiletto heels to work and actually found some interesting articles but all from Europe - where stiletto heels were deemed unsuitable and inappropriate for work. Hmm, and I thought it was the Americans who were prudes. In Russia, female cops dressed like this are being disciplined, though, to be fair, it was the short skirts, not the high heels, that were the cause of the Interior Ministry's ire. In Mexico, those stiletto boots really were to be blamed... The entire unit of 20 female cops, in the city of Aguascalientes in Central Mexico, were disbanded because they were hurting the force's image. I'm sure Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n aka El Chapo, would disagree. So alright, those pics are of police officers in uniform and DD is a homicide detective and does not wear a uniform so it's petty and unreasonable of me to criticize her choice of footwear. But waitaminute, there's an old 80s LAPD show, Hunter, featuring a pair or homicide detectives, Sgt. Rick Hunter and Sgt. Dee Dee McCall. See what happens when this Dee Dee wears heels while taking down a suspect/perp: You lose your high-heeled shoe and your partner ends up giving it back to you. Of course, he could end up keeping and wearing it like these Canadian cops: Hard for me to concentrate on a book after it does that to me. My 3 stars is reflective of the sour mood I was in - 3 stars has come to signify a so-so review for most Goodreads reviewers though there are those who follow GR's definition of 3 stars denoting 'good' or you liked it. My 3 stars here indicate it was just a so-so listen though I concede there's a much better story in there than I experienced. I didn't dislike DD because of her stilettos, though, but because of the way she treated Annabelle when the latter went to the station to tell the detectives what she'd been holding onto. DD was such a bitch, accusing Annabelle of wanting media attention instead of taking her seriously. Even if her suspicions were understandable, all DD needed to do was to test Annabelle by asking about certain details not known to the public. In the end, DD did exactly that by bringing out a locket and asking Annabelle about it. Perhaps one day, after I've forgiven and forgotten what Ms Gardner did to DD, I might relisten to this and end up with a 5-star book. After all, I detested Tess Gerritsen's Jane Rizzoli but Jane changed and now I'm hooked on the series. ...then again, that could be because Rizzoli doesn't wear stilettos to work. Not that I know. ...more Short Review for now: I give this book a HIGH RECOMMEND! Hide by Lisa Gardner is Mystery/Suspense book that has one of the most fascinating set-ups I could imagine.

Her father, a professor of mathematics at MIT, arrived home one night, quickly packed some bags, and told her and her mother that they were leaving Boston. To seven-year-old Annabelle, it was exciting: they were running away from home. They never stopped running after that night. Every new town was a new name and a potential new threat. The problem was that Annabelle never knew what that threat was. Her father never told her what they were running from. He simply taught her how not to trust anyone, how to fight back, and how to run and hide if she couldn\u2019t fight. She continued to run and hide, long after both her parents were dead, until one day, at age 22, when she saw a news story about the discovery of six bodies discovered on the grounds of an abandoned mental hospital outside Boston. The details of the news story were vague, but instinctually Annabelle knew that bodies were all of young girls, and she knew one of them was her best friend. It was finally time for her to stop running and hiding. Thus begins Lisa Gardner\u2019s intense thriller, \u201cHide\u201d. The novel features a pair of recurring characters, Boston PD detectives D.D. Warren and Bobby Dodge. There is, apparently, a lot of back-story with these two: former lovers, now strictly a professional relationship, but still clearly in love with each other. One can piece together a little bit of the back-story (it probably would have helped to start reading the books in order), but none of it is essential in understanding the main mystery at the heart of the story, which belongs mostly to Annabelle. Annabelle tries to do the right thing by going to the police with her story. When she first encounters skepticism and suspicion, she decides to play private detective to her own life mystery: What, or who, scared her father so much that he uprooted his family and left a decent-paying job? Why was her best childhood friend, along with five other girls, brutally murdered? Why does she seem to be the connection to all of it? During her investigation (with the reluctant help of Dodge and Warren), she discovers a possible link with a serial killer that abducted and tortured a young girl several years before her family left Boston. There are several other viable suspects, as well, all of them in some way connected to the abandoned mental hospital where the bodies were found. As she delves deeper into her past, she begins to realize why her father was so paranoid. He had reason to be. And that reason may be catching up to her, quickly... Gardner tells a fast-paced, well-plotted, and extremely suspenseful story. I\u2019m definitely going to be reading more of her books. Fans of Harlan Coben, Dennis Lehane, and Sara Paretsky will enjoy... ...more Lisa Gardner is very hit-and-miss with me as far as her plots go.

What really sticks out to me with this novel was the ill-planned reveal of the criminal's identity. I was ready to go along with the switches from first to third person, because while I usually find it annoying, I get that some authors find it a useful plot device, but in this case it just felt lazy, like Gardner had already written the first person sections and was too lazy to change them when she realized she wasn't able to keep her entire book in first person. That alone wasn't enough to make or break it for me, but alas, where this book really fails is in tying together all the threads of mystery. Instead of one bad guy it turns out we have two. Instead of the logical explanation, we get two convoluted ones. Basically, the ending felt like Gardner was trying too hard to be clever about who did it. It also ended up feeling like two novels she'd squished together into one, which wasn't annoying until the ending. In all, this book didn't impress me, but it also wasn't horrible. ...more HIDE (Suspense-Bobby Dodge-Boston-Cont) \u2013 VG Gardner, Lisa \u2013 Standalone Bantam, 2007, US Hardcover- ISBN: 9780553804324 First Sentence: My father explained it to me the first time when I was seven years old. *** Massachusetts state police detective Bobby Dodge is called to a Boston PD crime scene.

The lady knows how to write suspense with a human touch. Her characters are strong and fully dimensional, down to the members of the team; one of which as a new baby and another whose mother is dying. Her writing is atmospheric; you see the people on the train, and feel the closeness of the underground room. The story flows and builds taking the reader along on the investigation. You think you know where it\u2019s going and who the villain is, but you\u2019re not certain and then Gardner reveals a new element to keep you off balance. The ending does rather come at you out of no where but it always explains the reason for the family\u2019s moves. To introduce it sooner would have completely spoiled the suspense. \u201cHide\u201d was a very good, fast read. ...more 'My whole family disappeared... I can't afford to come back from the dead...'

And oh my god, why must the stupid main cop always develop a romantic interest in the \"victim?!\" (Except they never exactly are victims, but clearly they are supposed to fill that role.) To even call it a \"romantic interest\" is stretching things, since one moment there's nothing, and the next moment they are kissing, and then there are constant allusions later to their supposed chemistry that is never actually apparent...or noticeable at all.

Or at least I have no further interest in crappy novels by this particular author. ...more wederom een prachtig geschreven verhaal. Boeiend van het begin tot het einde.

Sometimes blunt. Sometimes clever. Sometimes not even real. In real life evil doesn't know it is evil. That's for history to decide. Even then that's not enough. What to do when villains won't confine themselves to History and remain there. ...more Unbelievable. Never believe anything Lisa Gardner tells you.

State Police Detective Bobby Dodge is called to the scene of a gruesome mass murder that took place on the grounds of the old State Mental Hospital. Six bodies of children are found in an underground chamber in a crime that appears to have taken place over twenty five years ago. One body is tentatively identified by a chain around her neck with the name Annabelle Granger. However, a woman who read about the bodies being discovered, tells the police that she is Annabelle and when she was seven she gave the locket to her friend, Dori Petracelli. Annabelle bears a striking resemblance to another woman who was abducted as a child and placed in an underground chamber. However, hunters heard the girls cries and rescued her. She testified against the man who placed her in the chamber and that man was in prison when the mass murders took place. The investigation moves to the Mental Hospital and prior patients. Two men seem to fit the profile of someone who might be capable of such a crime. We learn what these men did to be placed in the mental hospital and why the authorities would like to find them and question them further. Bobby and Det. D.D. Warren decide that Annabelle may have been the target of a sexual preditor and her parents were worried about this so they moved away and kept moving every few years. Lisa Gardner creates suspense as if she were a chef, putting the ingredients together for a feast. The momentum increases as we progress through this well plotted story. In addition, the author provides a surprise toward the novel's conclusion which was excellently described and perfectly logical. Annabelle was a sympathetic, likable character, who grew in confidence through the story. The antagonist was wee portrayed but the reader will have to learn why by exploring this fine story. Highly recommended. ...more It was a case that haunts Bobby Dodge to this day - the case that nearly killed him and changed his life forever.

Warren series and I wanted to read about a kick-ass female cop. The first two books are actually about Bobby and I really liked him. Unfortunately for me, they don't show D.D. Warren in a very good light. Instead of investigating she listens to gossip and jumps to conclusions about someone she knows better than most others do. Besides being a crappy friend it really kind of shows her as a crappy investigator. S So I originally picked up the first two books because they were the start of the D.D.

Well Lisa made me go on said ride from the very first page. This book is highly reommended along with others written by the amazing Lisa The best Lisa Gardner thriller yet. I am not sure why the series is called the DD Warren series when Detective Bobby Dodge seems to be the main character in the last three books I have read. Go figure. Fantastic series! Never knowing what to expect Every time I jump in a Lisa Gardner book I know I'm in for an exhilarating ride. I'm always on the edge of my seat I never know what is going to happen then when you least expect it the tide turns into a fury of commotion! Huge fan!!!! Wat een ongelooflijk spannend boek. De spanning wordt goed opgebouwd en vast gehouden. Het verhaal is goed uitgewerkt met de verschillende personen met een voor mij verrassend einde! I love that Lisa Gardner has the ability to keep you guessing until the very end. It makes these books fly by when you're reading them. I'm excited to keep reading this series and see where it ends up! I loved this!!! New state police detective Bobby Dodge is called in by lead investigator Boston PD Sgt. D.D.

New state police detective Bobby Dodge is called in by lead investigator Boston PD Sgt. D.D. Warren to help with a horrific case of a hole found by some boys on the grounds of a former mental institution. The two have a history of dating but also a breakup so Bobby is not thrilled to be called in and for his own boss to loan him out. Bobby had been a police sniper until he shot and killed a man who held his wife and son at gunpoint. After this event, he became close friends with the woman Catherine Gagnon. Catherine, at age 12, had been kidnapped and kept in a similar hole set up as a hidey-hole where she spent a month being half starved, dehydrated, and raped daily until some hunters heard her cries one day and helped her. She later was stalked by the man who had held her prisoner and she killed him. For DD and Bobby, this is deja vu only worse. In this hole which had been dug out with a backhoe are 6 clear seal plastic bags with girls-young girls- who had been kidnapped, raped, murdered, bagged, and labeled. The first bag has a 7 year old girl with a necklace that says Annabelle Granger. The next day, they are stunned when the real and very much alive Annabelle Granger (living under the alias Tanya Nelson) shows up. Her father, she explains, was an MIT math professor and her mom a housewife when 7 year old Boston resident Annabelle started receiving small boxes wrapped in the newspaper comics (Peanuts) started being left at their door. Her dad had to call in about a peeping Tom at her window and after police found her window had almost been broken into, it was discovered that someone had broken into the attic of the elderly widow next door and had been living up there and spying on the house. As Annabelle explains it, her dad immediately had her mom pack 5 suitcases and let Annabelle bring only two personal items (her stuffed toy and her pink blankie). They went to Florida and he got a job as a taxi driver and this was the beginning of a lifetime of moving. Every 18-24 months, they changed names and moved to a new city. Her mother finally overdosed on pills and alcohol and she found her dead. In the end, Annabelle and her dad returned to live in Boston as their final home. Annabelle's father died in an accident when he was run over by a taxi driver and his face was destroyed so Annabelle had to identify him by the vial of her mother's ashes he (and Annabelle) wore. DD is suspicious right away. Bobby is suspicious AND attracted and while Annabelle trusts no one (her dad taught her well) , she is strongly attracted to Bobby. Living along with her Australian Shepherd Bella, she has 5 locks on the door and has no friends or relationships with anyone. This story has as many twists and turns as a mountain road. As more info is learned, it makes the reader suspect everyone at some point. As it turns out, the 7 year old girl with Annabelle's necklace was her childhood best friend Dori. Annabelle's dad had told her to get rid of the necklace and she asked little Dori to keep it for her. Two weeks after they left, Dori is kidnapped and is one of the 6 bodies in hole. It is fascinating to watch the story and the clues unfold. Did one of the mental patients at the mental hospital do it? Some had been very violent and one had drugged the staff so he could escape when he wanted. Was it a former staff member? Or maybe the rich patient with a 3.5 million trust fund who was put in the mental hospital when he (who had been molested by an au pair at age 12) was caught at 20 by his parents raping his 14 year old sister? Was it the minister who DD and Bobby found there wandering the grounds and who later showed up in Boston at Annabelle's home? Was it the UPS driver or maybe Dori's father. One suspect was Annabelle's own dad especially when they can't find any record of a Russell Granger from MIT nor any driver's license or social security card for him, his wife or even Annabelle. Was Catherine, the woman who looks like she could be Annabelle's older sister involved? Everyone is shocked to learn that he showed up at Catherine's bedside when she was 12 and rescued from her own ordeal. He was pretending to be an FBI agent and showed her a charcoal drawing he had made of a man who looked like himself, demanding she say that it was the man who abducted, imprisoned, and raped her. At one point, there is a note left on DD's car to return the necklace. Who wrote it? Why is she being targeted? After you see what happens in the woods, you will wonder too. I like the way Lisa Gardner gives you so many suspects and writes an emotionally deep story. I felt so much for Annabelle, for Dori, for Dori's parents, and later for Annabelle's parents. There is gripping emotion so this is not just a mystery. Actually, I don't know why this is labelled a Detective D.D. Warren story since we learn almost nothing about her and she is far from sympathetic. This is really Annabelle Granger's story as well as Bobby Dodge's story. Both are well worth reading about. ...more The police case was compelling, and pretty gruesome, but it kept my interest the whole time. Unfortunately, two of the main characters were so awful that I can't give it any higher than two stars. It's been about six years (and hundreds of books) since I read the first book in this series. I still remember some of the details, but I don't remember Bobby being a complete tool like he was in this book.

The idea of a family being on the run for over 25 years and the unexpected death of Annabelle\u2019s father before the secrets are revealed is very smart and ingenious. As a parent, I was chilled to the bone on realizing how vulnerable our children are to the danger they can encounter with deranged people, who often go unseen in our midst. The plot is clever, fast paced, spellbinding and nail biting and I was amazed how the author kept me guessing until the end \u2013 though a time or two I thought I knew who the \u201cbad guy/s\u201d, where, I was thrown another clue.

The crime scene where the six mummified copses are discovered in the grounds of an abandoned Massachusetts mental asylum felt so scary, real, gruesome and frightening \u2013 I could sense the violence that happened to the victims, their pain \u2013 and so so creepy that I just wanted to get out of there. Talk about panic\u2026and does Lisa Gardner do this so well. I like that there was a romantic build-up between Annabelle and Bobby in the suspense filled time whilst searching for the answers to this complex tale. Such a character driven story \u2013 I engaged so quickly with the new appearances and enjoyed getting to know more about the ones from the previous book. I found it really difficult to put this book down and the ending was absolutely stunning and nothing like I expected.
