With a co The history of ethnic strife in Chechnya is long and confusing. Anthony Marra bypasses the facts and figures and takes us directly into the lives of ordinary people trying to make a meaningful existence amid the rubble and death and ongoing violence. Living in a state of constant trauma changes all the rules. Young and old, ethnic Russians and Chechen Muslims, the characters' lives intersect in such a way that they cannot hate each other with the intensity prescribed by their ancestors. With a complete absence of emotional manipulation, Marra takes us back and forth in the lives of the characters, moving along a timeline from 1994 to 2004. As they move in and out of periods of war, we see the events that led them to their current behaviors. Their choices begin to make more sense when we see how they have suffered, and the sins they have committed in the name of self-preservation. These are the sins for which they are now seeking absolution, whether from a higher power or from those they have wronged. I'm a picky reader, and my friends tell me I'm a hard grader when I rate books. I'm always skeptical when I hear raves about an up-and-coming author who's supposed to be the latest writing phenomenon. I always have to give them a chance, though, because once in awhile they turn out to be as talented as promised. Anthony Marra is one of those who deserves all the praise he's receiving. If you like serious literary fiction, this is a novel you won't want to miss. ADDENDUM: If you think you're too much of a history dolt to enjoy this book, don't let that stop you.<---F> A quick overview here http://en</---F>.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya , with focus on the First Chechen War, Interwar Period, and Second Chechen War, will give you enough context to understand the impact on the characters, the economy, and the infrastructure of the country. ...more This beautiful and haunting novel is one of my favorite books of 2013.

It takes place in post-war Chechnya, but don't be alarmed if you don't know much about the Chechen conflict with Russia \u2014 the rich storytelling and the gorgeous prose will draw you in, and by the end of the book you could captivate an audience with these wartime stories. But first, you must meet Havaa, a precocious little girl whose father was just taken by federal forces, probably never to be seen again. Havaa ran into the woods to hide, which is why the soldiers didn't find her. The girl's mother is dead and she has no one else. A neighbor, Akhmed, helps Havaa escape to a nearby town and convinces a doctor, Sonja, to look after her. Soon our cast of characters will expand and we will meet Akhmed's wife, Havaa's father, Sonja's sister, and other residents in the village of Eldar, each of them with a story to tell. One of my favorite characters was Sonja, a tough doctor who left Chechnya to attend medical school in London, but she returned to her war-torn country to try and help her sister, Natasha, who later disappeared: \"Though she was the elder, Sonja was always thought of as Natasha's sister, the object rather than the subject of any sentence the two shared. She walked alone down the school corridors, head sternly bent toward the stack of books in her arms ... Sonja had more academic journal subscriptions than friends. She could explain advanced calculus to her fifth-form algebra teacher but couldn't tell a joke to a boy at lunch. Even in the summer months, she had the complexion of someone who spent too much time in a cellar. Everyone knew Sonja was destined for great things, but no one knew what to do with her until then.\" Another character I loved was Akhmed, a man who studied to be a doctor but who would rather have been an artist. He jokes that he is the worst doctor in Chechnya, but he still manages to help his patients and their families, sometimes by drawing portraits of those who have been killed or taken by the feds. Anthony Marra's writing is beautiful, with stunning sentences that made me pause and reread them. If I hadn't been reading a library book I would have underlined innumerable paragraphs. (The page-long sentence on p. 139 was so emotional and breathtaking that I actually gasped.) Each chapter opens with a timeline, pinpointing a year between 1994 and 2004, and the flashbacks illuminate what happened to our characters during the war. While the chapter focuses on one character's perspective, the stories ebb and flow together like overlapping melodies. This is a novel whose plotting and gracefulness I admired so much that as soon as I had finished it, I immediately wanted to start over and read it again. What details! What connections! This is the kind of novel I love to read -- one that is complex and meaningful and full of humanity and life and I wish I could give a copy to every bookish friend I know. Ann Patchett, who is one of my favorite writers, told The New York Times that this was her favorite book she's read this year. Agreed. Note: If you're wondering what the title means, it is taken from a definition in a medical dictionary: \"Life: a constellation of vital phenomena -- organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation.\" ...more Upon starting this book I had heard of Chechnya. I couldn't point it out on a map though. Or even have told you what part of the world it was in. This book takes you there. Not just in mind..but in spirit also. The author states he chose to write about this area after hearing about the death of journalist Anna Polikovskaya from her reporting she did from Chechnya. He read up on the non-fiction reports he could find from the area. I'm glad he did it. My eyes would have glazed over from the enormi Upon starting this book I had heard of Chechnya. I couldn't point it out on a map though. Or even have told you what part of the world it was in. This book takes you there. Not just in mind..but in spirit also. The author states he chose to write about this area after hearing about the death of journalist Anna Polikovskaya from her reporting she did from Chechnya. He read up on the non-fiction reports he could find from the area. I'm glad he did it. My eyes would have glazed over from the enormity of it. The story begins with 8 year old Haava seeing her father taken by soldiers in the middle of the night. Even at that young age she knows that her father isn't returning. Akhmed her neighbors sweeps her up and runs because she is also a target. He hides her with a frustrated Russian Doctor named Sonja. Sonja and Akhmed are amazing characters. They both come to life in the book. I'll remember Akhmed for a long time after finishing this. His humor in the face of such tragedy. He admits he is a horrible doctor with a wry sense. The story takes place over 5 days..5 days that will stick with the reader long afterward. The author does use flashbacks so that you become entwined in these characters lives. For a first book this book is absolutely amazing. I received an copy of this book from blogging for books in exchange for an honest review. ...more I loved this portrait of ordinary people doing their extraordinary best under the duress of war in Chechnya.

Their human spirit shines through like the grass that grows in the cracks of a sidewalk. I was inspired with Marra\u2019s ability to portray how in the face of war\u2019s devastation, people focus their purpose on whatever family members or shreds of community they retain, and when even that is gone, they forge a virtual family. Most of the story takes place in a few days in 2004, with flashbacks to the two periods of invasion of Chechnya by Russian Federation forces in 1994 and 1999, which was marked by massive civilian casualties by bombings and artillery strikes. During extended periods of occupation, systematic repression and torture was rampant to assure that this republic did not break away as so many other Soviet states did after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The book is not concerned with the politics and combat of the specific war, but with the miracles of human nature within the society impacted by such events. Marra stretches hard to make language capture this life as \u201ca constellation of vital phenomena\u201d. Almost everyone is a hero in this tale. The two main characters are doctors. Akhmed is a Muslim primary care doctor in a rural community in southern Chechnya. He saves an orphan girl, Havaa, from federal forces that killed her father and burned her home. In the first pages, we experience him finding eight-year old Havaa and placing her in sanctuary at the hospital in the nearby city of Volchansk. Sonja is a female surgeon of ethnic Russian origin who has taken over the running of the hospital in this bombed out city. The price she asks of Akhmed in return for the favor is for him to serve on her medical staff, which calls for daily forays from his caretaker role for his disabled wife. The evolution of Akhmed and Sonja\u2019s relationship was wonderful for me. She is superbly competent but gruff and cynical, with no bedside manner, whereas Akhmed is warm and self-deprecating, but poorly equipped for the task. He was always more interested in art than medicine. His most recent art was putting up around his village large portraits on panels of the disappeared, a touching act Marra bases on a real event. Sonya schools him in trauma care and lessens his despair by instilling a sense of purpose, and he in turn helps humanizes her, makes her laugh, and raises her hopes of finding her missing sister . Humor helps break down barriers between them: He was an incompetent doctor but a decent man, he believed, compensating for his physician limitations with his empathy for the patient, his understanding of pain. \u2026\u201dI shouldn\u2019t spend so much time with you. You\u2019ll turn me into a first-rate surgeon and a boor.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s the other way around\u201d, she said. A gauze of afternoon cloud cover had wrapped around the sky and she looked up and into it. \u201cI\u2019m overcome by the inexplicable desire to speak to you with common courtesy.\u201d Havaa\u2019s story of resilience and poignant efforts to make sense of her family\u2019s loss makes her a hero too. Although Sonja generally hates kids, we see Havaa\u2019s precocity begin to win her heart when the child first speaks to her of her \u201cdisappeared\u201d father: \u201cHe\u2019s an arborist. He knows everything about trees. I\u2019m still a minimalist.\u201d \u201cDo you know what that is?\u201d Havaa nodded, expecting the question. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice way of saying you have nothing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to know big word\u201d, the girl said, repeating her father\u2019s maxim. \u201cNo one can take what\u2019s indside your head once it\u2019s there.\u201d \u201cYou sound like a solipsist.\u201d Another key character, is Khassan, a friend and neighbor of Akhmed who has worked his whole life on a 3,000 page history of the Chechen. The muted voice of the people is epitomized by the succession of regimes that have refused to allow him to publish any of it except the segments up to the Middle Ages. He is further silenced by the interruption of his friendship and regular chess playing with Havaa\u2019s father and by his termination of all communication with his remaining family member, a son who has been tortured into becoming an informer for Russian security forces. The most moving part of the book for me lies in Khassan\u2019s finding relief from his isolation by disclosure of the story of a secret love affair from his past to Akhmed\u2019s bedridden and demented wife. This story takes place against the background of Stalin\u2019s transplantation of their families along with half a million of native Chechens to Kazakhstan, which lasted from 1944 until repatriation of survivors in 1957. The prose in this book is what often makes it special to me. Sometimes it calls too much attention to itself, and sometimes it comes off as clumsy, requiring reading the sentences more than once to achieve understanding. As an example of success, here the torment of Khassan\u2019s son is captured as he experiences the impact of having to become an informer: Snow had thickened the ground. The quiet of the house followed him into the woods. Two hundred meters in, raising his head in a long scream, he tore a hole in the silence through which he could walk more freely. Here is an example that does well at first in capturing Akhmed\u2019s shock of dealing with a victim of a landmine, but to me it overreaches toward the end: \u2026 he wasn\u2019t the first man he had seen writhing like a noodle in a pot of boiling water, not the first he had seen with half his shin hanging by a hinge of sinew. But when he saw this man it was like seeing the first man for the first time: he couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t act, could only stand in shock as the air where the man\u2019s leg should have been filled the floor and the room and his open mouth. \u2026Then the man\u2019s pulse was a haphazard exertion against his finger. I admire Marra so much for trying and often succeeding that I have to forgive him for flying too close to the sun sometimes. Here is a final example, which sings so well about Ahkmed\u2019s feeling of loss of his wife to dementia but to me stumbles at the end: He was losing her incrementally. It might be a few stray brown hairs listless on the pillow, or the crescents of fingernails tossed behind the headboard, or a dark shape dissolving in soap. As a web is no more than holes woven together, they were bonded by what was no longer there. The dishes no longer prepared or eaten. The walks no longer walked, the summer woods, the undergrowth parted by their shins. The arguments no longer argued; no stakes, nothing either wanted or could lose. The love no longer made, desired, imagined, or mourned. The illness had resorted to an innocence he was unwilling to pollute, and the warmth of her flesh cocooning his was a shard of their life dislodged from both their memories. Against the forces of erasure, the characters nurture life through their memories, spark hopes for each other, and find windows for humor and for love. Morality is frequently compromised, but the wellsprings of their personal integrity are preserved. No wonder 13 out of 15 of my GR friends rendered 4 or 5 stars for this debut novel. Marra looks too young to believe he could create this out of imagination, research, and visits to Chechnya. But he wrote it at 28 years of age, and a Stanford professor where he was a graduate student in creative writing was quoted as saying his skills were already fully developed. In an interview included at the end of this book, he cites the influence of Benioff\u2019s \u201cCity of Thieves\u201d, which despite its portrayal of suffering at the Siege of Leningrad is \u201cfilled to the brim with life, love, humor, even joy, all of which only enhance and make more real the underlying historical tragedy.\u201d ...more As well as being the most cleverly structured novel I\u2019ve read all year A Constellation of Vital Phenomenon also features some of the most memorable characters. Ostensibly the novel is set in Chechnya though in many ways the novel depicts a generic modern war and the terrifying lawlessness that prevails in an invaded country. I have to say I learnt next to nothing about the Chechen wars. Marra uses an invented town in the novel and at times you feel he\u2019s also using an invented country.

I have to say I learnt next to nothing about the Chechen wars. Marra uses an invented town in the novel and at times you feel he\u2019s also using an invented country. As with most novels set during wartime it\u2019s easy to care about the characters whose survival is threatened on a daily basis. Essential to the plot is our emotional investment in Havaa, the eight year old girl whose father is \u201cdisappeared\u201d one night and Akhmed, an inept surgeon who prefers drawing and takes it upon himself to ensure Havaa\u2019s survival. Survival is often depicted as the struggle to keep memory of loved ones alive. The novel is garlanded with tokens of memory. Every character carries a key memory of another character and these form a brilliantly executed mosaic of mysteries. Ostensibly it takes place over five days but the numerous flashbacks scatter compelling mysteries throughout its pages. We wait for the past to catch up with and connect each character. There\u2019s so much excitement to be had in making all these connections and his handling of the order of the flashbacks is masterful in keeping this excitement at a high pitch throughout. Perhaps the connections are too numerous and the characters overly endowed with artistic gifts to make this any kind of convincing appraisal of an historical event. Marra deals with this problem by using a whimsical tone throughout to offset all the brutality and senselessness. It\u2019s a tone that reminded me of Nicole Krauss\u2019 The History of Love and Foer\u2019s Everything Is Illuminated . And it\u2019s another triumph that Marra gets away with it, largely because of the inspired lyricism of his prose. Not once did I have trouble suspending disbelief because he succeeded so well in forging in me a deep emotional connection to his characters. Probably best to point out this won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s cup of tea. It\u2019s a labyrinth of a novel that requires intense concentration. If you read even a single page with your mind elsewhere you\u2019ll soon find yourself a bit stranded. ...more \u00ab\u039f \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9

Russ We all know, as William Tecumseh Sherman once noted, that \u201cWar is Hell!\u201d Later, Jean-Paul Sartre concluded that \u201cHell is other people.\u201d It therefore stands to reason that war is other people. Good thing for me that it's about others because what Marra described in this book sounded awful. We got chopped off fingers, burned down houses, torture-induced ratting, and a whole host of other atrocities. It was set in Chechnya in 2004 with much of the story backfilled from the prior decade of war. Russian politics and regional dynamics were deemphasized, though, so it was somewhat generically about any oppressed, occupied state. The focus was clearly on the human side. Three main characters filled the pages. The story began as eight-year-old Havaa watched her house burn down from the relative safety of the forest she was told to hide in when the Russian soldiers arrived. She became far safer when neighbor Akhmed, a kindly but inept doctor, walked her to a hospital where there was one remaining doctor, a Russian named Sonja. His best hope for Havaa was that the brusque but talented Sonja would take the girl in. Havaa was precocious, and was maybe one of the few people in Sonja\u2019s league intellectually, so that helped her odds. But these things have to develop at novel-length pace, right? The cumulative conflict along the way has to reach a tipping point. A secondary set of characters got POV spotlights as well, including Akhmed\u2019s physically and mentally compromised wife, Havaa\u2019s loving father who had just been taken away, Sonja\u2019s beautiful (better liked, now missing) sister, and an old villager named Khassan who had written a massive history of the Chechen people. Khassan\u2019s son, a pariah for informing on his neighbors, had a story, too \u2013 a sad, multi-sided one. The title came from an old medical textbook Sonja owned. \u201cOnly one entry supplied an adequate definition, and she circled it with red ink, and referred to it nightly. Life: a constellation of vital phenomena--organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation.\u201d Marra no doubt wanted this to apply more widely to his entire book, with life intensified by perils of death. Did he succeed? Well\u2026 I\u2019ve been trying to sort that out. It\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s a young man with promise. And I give him plenty of points for ambition. The parts I\u2019d criticize are really a matter of taste. I know, too, given all the stars this one gets from discerning friends that my own view is not the popular one, but I did find it a tad overdone. This may seem odd coming from a guy whose catch-phrase is \u201cNothing exceeds like excess,\u201d but at times I felt that <+++>A Constellation of Vital Phenomena</+++> was an entanglement of florid descriptors or maybe an agglomeration of symphonious hyperbole. More than once I got a sense of him in a creative writing class, vying for teacher\u2019s pet status. The structuring was fine, with the to-and-fro in time generally adding interest. He did have this quirk, though, were he\u2019d randomly fast-forward the life of some insignificant character, telling us for no apparent reason that, say, twenty-eight years after the war a nameless sentry we just met retired from his career as a teacher. It was a device that called attention to itself, and risked breaking the spell. Better to crawl deeper into the skin of someone we\u2019re meant to care about. I\u2019m giving this 3.5 stars and rounding to 4. The vitality is there, as is the poignancy. The fact that I debated my own feelings about it meant that he made me think, which I should count as a good thing. I\u2019ll be interested to see what a few years of ripening will do to Marra as a writer. It's a good bet his book of short stories, The Tsar of Love and Techno , will influence my eventual view. ...more December 4th, 2013: This is not on the New York Times' Ten Best Books of 2013 but it should have been.

A number of original and whimsical characters were woven into his rich tapestry of words, and for many pages, I wondered just why such-and-such character was being portrayed in great detail. But then it all started coming together, and \u2013 wow oh wow. The title comes from a description of life in a medical book: Life is a constellation of vital phenomena \u2013 organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation. A careful reading reveals that for this community of characters, the description is quite apt. The novel primarily takes place throughout a decade \u2013 from 1996 to 2004 \u2013 and a line graph at the top of each chapter centers the reader in the timeline. There are three key characters \u2013 Akhmed, an incompetent doctor with a good heart\u2026Sonja, a bone-weary surgeon who labors each day at a bombed-out hospital that serves as the only respite for those who have been injured\u2026and Havaa, an eight-year-old girl who has already been forced to endure and lose too much. Many other secondary characters populate this epic tale, including a beautifully-detailed portrait of a damaged man who has turned informer: Ramzan. All of these characters will become tied in an intricate web of connections that reveal how human fate is not just in our own hands, but in the hands of all humanity. The result is a haunting and original look into many universal themes. Ramzan says, \u201cWe\u2019re beyond obligation. We wear clothes and speak, and create civilizations, and believe we are more than wolves. But inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are.\u201d Or is it? Rather than embrace Ramzan\u2019s view of the world, this book shines a spotlight on the true meanings of love and sacrifice, and the lengths we will go to connect and endure. While heartbreaking at times, the book, at its core, is hopeful and proves that an \u201cimmense, spinning joy\u201d can occur even when one\u2019s very humanity is threatened. I view this Constellation as a potential classic. It is that stellar. ...more Oh, what a joy to read a fully-realized, beautifully written, totally engrossing novel.

It can feel satisfying on one level with everything fitting so neatly (who has crossed paths with whom, etc.) but it made me think really? one time too many. An extension of that point is the flash forwards with all the random characters. This, too, can feel satisfying--yes, life will go on from all this awfulness--but I felt the heavy hand of the novelist here, a little too much. But those are small things. This is an ambitious novel--hard to believe it is a debut--and an incredibly moving one. (I admit I cried multiple times.) I'm looking forward to Marra's story collection and future work.

Constellation immerses one in the East\u2014at no time does one imagine oneself to be anywhere but in that place east of Europe and west of the Caspian. I suppose everyone will have familiarized themselves with Chechnya now, after the 2013 Boston Marathon, but it is north of the Caucasus Mountain Range that separates Russia and its \u201crind of former republics\u201d from what westerners term The Middle East. It has been the site of grim partisan wars, fought by hand and in person, back when one actually had to show up to kill another. This hard-hitting novel shows us the broken families littering the landscape there, some forced into unseemly alliances with enemies, and the nearly limitless capacity of humans to inflict pain. Among the legion who are broken, there are still some who retain a measure of humor, dignity, and goodness that they share with other good souls. They recognize one another, these folks who hold themselves aloof from the cruelty, and it is because of them that we can even dream of a day when the sun shines on a peaceful patch of land where they can grow the food they need, play chess in the shade of a large tree, make music and make love and laugh without fear. Marra gives us all this\u2014what is there and what is not yet there\u2014through the depth and strength of his writing of a people, place and time. His descriptions linger in the memory and stop the eye on the page. The Russian doctor, Sonja, was \u201ca riddle wrapped inside a mystery inside a set of unattractive but very white scrubs.\u201d She returned to Chechnya from a safe place in London to find her beloved sister Natasha. \u201cThough she was the elder, Sonja was always thought of as Natasha\u2019s sister, the object rather than the subject of any sentence the two shared.\u201d She met Akmed, a better portraitist than he was a doctor, who helped her in the hospital and in life. In the midst of the betrayals and the shortening life horizon, for a brief moment \u201cthe circumference of the world tightened to what their arms encompassed.\u201d But that moment passed and Havaa, beloved daughter of Dokka, remained, the daughter upon whom everyone\u2019s hopes were pinned. The \u201cConstellation of Vital Phenomena\u201d, gotten from an ancient medical text, is a term to describe life and in this definition consists of \u201corganization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, and adaptation.\u201d Couldn\u2019t the very same words be used to describe any work of art in the process of construction, like for instance, a novel? This is an extraordinary piece of work, especially for a newcomer. I challenge you to forget this book, and your first up-close glimpse of that place called Chechnya. It distinguishes itself by its subject and the incisiveness of the writing. Despite the horror, or perhaps because of it, one wishes to see the place, to care and bear witness for the folks that stood up for their most basic rights\u2014to live in peace, if not happiness. \u201cNot knowing what to do, [Kassan] walked back and forth [in the snow], urging the dogs to do so likewise, turning the snow into a riddle no one could solve.\u201d An early essay of Marra\u2019s when he graduated from the Iowa Writer\u2019s Workshop is a deferential tug-to-the-forelock to other authors but does not reveal the man, only his leavings. I look forward to seeing more of his work. ...more I am in awe; Anthony Marra has a rare gift with words.

Characters are where Marra shines the most - he has a way of creating precise and concise characters with just a sentence and a half. Every single person showing up in this book is just that - a fully fleshed out person. I cannot think of many authors who are able to create a picture so vivid with so little words. It is beyond impressive. While I didn't quite love this as much as I loved Marra's second book ( The Tsar of Love and Techno ), I still think it is an exceptional novel with unbelievable depth to it. It is a book that demands to be reread; it is dense and taxing and so much is happening and so many connections are made, that I am sure a second read would be very rewarding still. While this is a very rewarding book it is also a very human one. Marra does not sacrifice substance to achieve style and his book is as emotionally rewarding as it is intellectually impressive.

It is of course about the ravages of war. It is grim reading, and until the end there is little that inspires any hope. Although the author does infuse the story with humor, it is ironic humor, sad humor; humor that laughs at the stupidity of man. The humor in this book rarely made me laugh. There is a glimmer of hope at the end, but it is too late and too weak. You must know by now that I do not demand jolly books, but this one is d-e-p-r-e-s-s-i-n-g. You will nod and sigh and shake your heads with utter despair. So do you learn much about the two Chechen Wars? Not really, other than that they were horrible. The book is choppy in that you flip back and forth in time. It is confusing, not so much because of the different time settings but because the author never says anything directly. The language is convoluted. What is said, is implied . This is not to my taste. I prefer a more direct, simple language. I remember at one point they had to go around a dangerous spot, but what does Anthony Marra say? They circumnavigated the area. Over and over I muttered - just say it straight. I felt like I was supposed to be impressed with his clever words. I admit, the author did occasionally express himself beautifully. There were times when he blew me away in his ability to beautifully depict a situation, an event or an idea. The narration by Colette Whitaker was not to my taste either. Much of the time she droned on in a dispassionate manner. This was not so bad when the horrors of the war were related, but it was almost numbing. Neither did I like the so very typical Eastern European accent attributed to the Chechens. What did I get from this? After reading it, have I a more detailed, better understanding of the Chechen Wars? Scarcely! It is mostly about how the people suffered, and that I knew. Did it impart an important message that was new? No. Most people seem to be head over heels in love with this new author. Not me. ...more I originally learned about this book when it was longlisted for the National Book Award .

It didn't make the shortlist, but personally I would have traded it with the Lahiri, since that book had similar themes to her previous works, and this felt new. Phew. About halfway through, I had to take a break from this book. It is an intense read of a too-recent war-torn Chechnya, from a perspective not quite the same as what we were hearing in American news. The author moves backwards and forwards in time, but always tells you exactly where you are at the beginning of every chapter, which starts from a timeline listing the years from 1994-2004. The year in question is in bold, to leave no mistake. And then as the reader, you get dumped into the events of that year, concerning a rather small cast of characters in a small Chechnyan town. The darkness almost got to be too much for me, but there are some things that balance it out. Other readers have pointed out moments of humor to me, and while I wasn't ready to see them as funny while reading, they did have a balance, a humanity, that the senseless violence really needed. Also the author will sometimes show you the future of a minor character, many living decades longer and having completely fulfilling lives. This helps to counteract some of the bad situations and bad decisions for some of the people on the periphery, but the more we learn about the main characters, the worse it gets. There is no humanity in war. This little quote sounds very similar to what Winston repeats in 1984, and it makes sense, since both the people in that novel and in Chechnya were in constant fear of disappearing: \"It's important to know big words,\" the girls said, repeating her father's maxim. \"No one can take what's inside your head once it's there.\" The theme of disappearing loved ones is central to this novel, and since the time moves back and forth, it is almost as if you experience it multiple times. \"...This was how a loved one disappeared. Despite the shock of walking into an empty flat, the absence isn't immediate, more a fade from the present tense you shared, a melting into the past, not an erasure but a conversion in form, from presence to memory, from solid to liquid, and the person you once touched now runs over your skin, now in sheets down your back, and you may bathe, may sink, may drown in the memory, but your fingers cannot hold it.\" This is the rare novel that doesn't rely on simple language. A sample: \"Her ethnic status propelled her into the elite echelons of adolescent popularity, where a personality cult had arisen around her, fueled by the adoration of obsequious underclassmen.\" At times, I could feel the author's painstaking effort with each sentence, sometimes too much, but in the end it didn't deter from the novel itself.

A story of the transcendent power of love in wartime, A Constellation of Vital Phenomena is a work of sweeping breadth, profound compassion, and lasting significance. I was so overwhelmed by this book that I left the writing of the review for several hours. I just couldn't get my emotions back on track to express the impact it had on me. My heart was simply ripped out. The lyrical prose in this book was outstanding. I often sat back and deliberated on the choice of words, and the way the story played itself out. For instance, how unusual was it, to describe the return of someone's remains to a hometown like this: As she refolded the note and dropped it into the trash can, he wanted to reach out, to snatch the tumbling rectangle before it landed and was lost among the last words of two dozen others who died far from their villages, who were pitched by strangers into furnaces, who were buried in cloud cover and wouldn\u2019t return home until the next snowfall.\" A ten year war from 1994 to 2004 raged in Chechnya, leaving the landscape derelict, destroyed, dysfunctional, demolished. Violence established itself in all aspects of society. Brutality reigned as the only guarantee for survival. (view spoiler) [ I wanted to add this long sentence, summarizing the period in history excellently, to the review. Khassan: \"At that momentous hour on December 26, 1991, as he watched the red flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\u2014the empire extending eleven times zones, from the Sea of Japan to the Baltic coast, encompassing more than a hundred ethnicities and two hundred languages; the collective whose security demanded the sacrifice of millions, whose Slavic stupidity had demanded the deportation of Khassan\u2019s entire homeland; that utopian mirage cooked up by cruel young men who gave their mustaches more care than their morality; that whole horrid system that told him what he could be and do and think and say and believe and love and desire and hate, the system captained by Lenin and Zinoviev and Stalin and Malenkov and Beria and Molotov and Khrushchev and Kosygin and Mikoyan and Podgorny and Brezhnev and Andropov and Chernenko and Gorbachev, all of whom but Gorbachev he hated with a scorn no author should have for his subject, a scorn genetically encoded in his blood, inherited from his ancestors with their black hair and dark skin\u2014as he watched that flag slink down the Kremlin flagpole for the final time, left limp by the windless sky, as if even the weather wanted to impart on communism this final disgrace, he looped his arms around his wife and son and he held them as the state that had denied him his life quietly died.\" (hide spoiler) ] Many characters were created which provided ample opportunities to describe the different forms of violence and barbaric torturous acts defining the history of the period. They were all strong, imperfect human beings who did different things to survive without losing their souls to the madness of the daily events. The ambushing of their existence just never stopped. Although they were all bruised and broken souls, dying little by little as time goes by, they depended on the human spirit to form strong bonds and little by little helped each other to overcome their challenges. The title of the novel comes from a medical dictionary defining Life as 'a constellation of vital phenomena - organization, irrittability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation.' This definition also concludes the lives of Deshi, Maali, Sonja, Natasha, Akhmed, Khassan, Ramzan, Havaa, Dokka, and Uli. This novel was one of the most profound books I have ever read. If it was possible I would have quoted the entire book. The prose was just excellent. It's hard to comprehend how young the author is because his talent to turn this tragedy into an atmospheric, compassionate tale is truly remarkable. This is historical fiction at its finest. Taking the factual, sterile, media coverage of a war and turning it into this heartwarming as well as heartbreaking tale, requires an extraordinary talent. If you love Khaled Hosseini's books, you will love this one as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ...more I'm not saying I didn't like the beginning of this novel, but when I arrived at page 139, I became hooked, absolutely hooked.

The passage (actually one long sentence) is about a younger brother along with his family (whom the readers never see again) at the village doctor's (a better artist than he is a doctor) to describe his 'disappeared' older brother in order for the doctor to draw his portrait. The lyricism of the long sentence is what captivated me at the time, but it also encapsulates much of what else is also wonderful about this book, e.g., the omniscient voice that many times gives us a glimpse of the future and the author's handling of time, in general. As to the latter, it's only as you keep reading that you realize how impressive that handling of time is, and how it reflects one of the themes. The characters sometimes think of an event, matter-of-factly, that's not immediately explained to the reader. Eventually, the writer takes us back in time, maybe one year, maybe seven, and then we know, too. The technique creates tension in the reader that merely hints at (thank goodness for us) the tension felt in the daily lives of these characters, who are not participants in the wars, but villagers and a few remaining city-dwellers trying to survive as best they can. The one torture scene is like a feverish nightmare that feels even longer that it actually is, one you want to read between your fingers, but the book needs it to be there and you are grateful for it being only the one: it stays in your mind and stands for many more. In my reading of it, I could only think of it as also being an indictment against the dangerous territory the U.S. seems to have found its way toward as well. When I first read about this book, I found it eerie that its release date was so soon -- less than a month -- after the Boston Marathon bombing, which was orchestrated by two self-identified Chechen brothers. Perhaps, I thought, this novel could shed some light on their mindset. That would be a tall order, of course, and not within the novel's scope by any stretch of the imagination, but a light is shed on a people who were forced from their homeland (many, of course, were killed), allowed to return over a decade later, then persecuted again. The tragic history of ethnic purging once again seems all too familiar and absurd. ...more Anthony Marra\u2019s first novel, \u201cA Constellation of Vital Phenomena,\u201d is a flash in the heavens that makes you look up and believe in miracles.

Go ahead and sneer at the thin atmosphere of America\u2019s MFA programs, but this Washington-born graduate of the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop is a testament to the vibrancy of contemporary fiction. Here, in fresh, graceful prose, is a profound story that dares to be as tender as it is ghastly, a story about desperate lives in a remote land that will quickly seem impossibly close and important. \u201cA Constellation of Vital Phenomena\u201d opens in a tiny, blood-soaked village of Chechnya, that part of the world that drifts into our consciousness only briefly \u2014 when, say, the Russians crush it again or, more recently, when young zealots detonate pressure cookers in Boston. But the unforgettable characters in this novel are not federalists or rebels or terrorists. They aren\u2019t particularly religious or political; we see only glimpses of loyal Russian officers or fanatical Muslims. Instead, these are just fathers and mothers and children \u2014 neighbors snagged in the claws of history. The book begins with a sentence that forecasts both the horror and the whimsy ahead: \u201cOn the morning after the Feds burned down her house and took her father, Havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones.\u201d Havaa, we learn, is 8 and now almost certainly orphaned. \u201cShe had the pale, waxen skin of an unripe pear,\u201d Marra writes. Her father, who nurtured her curiosity with extravagant affection, was an arborist who had lost his fingers in a previous encounter with the Feds and a pair of bolt cutters. When he was gagged with duct tape and bundled away for good, Havaa avoided assassination by sneaking out of the house and hiding in the snow. But those thugs will be back, fulfilling a new order to murder the family members of anyone suspected of sympathizing with rebel forces. The complicated moral hero of this tale is an incompetent peasant doctor named Akhmed, who lives across the street. More comfortable drawing portraits than blood, he is determined to save his old friend\u2019s daughter, though \u201cshe seemed an immense and overwhelming creature whom he was destined to fail.\u201d His only choice is to spirit Havaa out of the village, where the sole remaining career choices are running guns for the rebels or informing for the Russians. Acting on a rumor from a refugee who passed through months earlier, he takes Havaa to an all-but-abandoned hospital in a nearby town that looks \u201clike a city made of shoeboxes and stamped into the ground by a petulant child.\u201d On one level, \u201cA Constellation of Vital Phenomena\u201d covers just five days in 2004. But these are people shaken from the linear progress of time. Their experiences come to us in pungent flashbacks of trauma and joy \u2014 meals and games, marriages and affairs, offenses small and shocking that knit their lives together. Each chapter begins with the date highlighted on a timeline that runs from 1994 to 2004, jumping forward and backward, sometimes creating new mysteries, sometimes solving old ones. Other references draw us outside that 10-year range. A scholar in the village toils his whole life on a history of \u201cthis sliver of humanity the world seemed determined to forget.\u201d At more than 50,000 pages, the old man\u2019s manuscript flows from a kind of mania, reaching further and further back to avoid the ire of Russian censors. But then, too, there are moments of mercy in this tale, grace notes when Marra casually alludes to what certain characters will be doing far in the future; yes, he assures us, some of these people you care about \u2014 or loathe \u2014 will live deep into the 21st century. Marra, who has traveled through Chechnya, re-creates Akhmed and Havaa\u2019s village in the hard, spare elements of wood and snow and blood. For all the bizarre images and incidents he describes, he stays rooted in the concrete insanity of this conflict, this unstanchable wound on Europe\u2019s eastern side. We see unexploded bombs lying in the street covered with toilet bowls,a clown crying in a basement during an aerial assault,a soldier insisting his prisoners wear seat belts on their way to a death camp. But these aren\u2019t the quirky ornaments that floated through \u201cThe Tiger\u2019s Wife,\u201d T\u00e9a Obreht\u2019s dreamy first novel about a doctor in the war-torn Balkans. In \u201cA Constellation,\u201d the surreal has been stamped into flesh and bone. Marra was guided by, among other books, the work of assassinated Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. This is a land once forcibly emptied by the U.S.S.R., then officially repopulated, and now being savaged by guerrilla attacks and merciless retaliations. Two years before the novel opens, 41 villagers were \u201cdisappeared\u201d in a single day, shot in the forest or trucked off to be tortured to death in a place only Hieronymus Bosch or the godchildren of Stalin could imagine. Be warned: There\u2019s a section of \u201cA Constellation\u201d splattered with viscera that will scar your conscience and remind you what the United States risks by blurring the hard-won moral and legal prohibitions against torture. Driving this intense tragedy is an ordinary man, Ramzan, a young neighbor who was poisoned by pain, driven to accept his role as village rat. In pages of almost unreadably creative abuse, Marra takes us into the crucible where bodies and minds are crushed and the elixir of betrayal is purified. \u201cWe are the children of wolves,\u201d Ramzan says. \u201cI recognize you,\u201d his father thinks. \u201cWe twist our souls around each other\u2019s miseries.\u201d The almost-empty hospital where Akhmed hides Havaa provides a weird alternative world to the grim village. Staffed by a single nurse, a one-armed guard and a Russian surgeon searching for her sister, it\u2019s a madhouse but also a sanctuary, where strands of absurdity and realism mingle without clashing. From the infinite black space of despair emerges \u201ca constellation of vital phenomena,\u201d an arresting definition of \u201clife\u201d found in an old medical textbook. Marra isn\u2019t above offering snatches of comic banter among this ragtag staff too foolish or compassionate to flee. The surgeon, who assumes she has cauterized her affections, spars with Akhmed in a way that tempts us to anticipate some romantic engagement, maybe even a little happiness. As the elements of this complicated plot begin to align in ways too tragic and moving to anticipate, the past resolves into focus; the future is freighted with anguish but flecked with hope. I haven\u2019t been so overwhelmed by a novel in years. At the risk of raising your expectations too high, I have to say you simply must read this book. ...more 3.7 rating for me!

A story of the transcendent power of love in wartime, A Constellation of Vital Phenomena is a work of sweeping breadth, profound compassion, and lasting significance. My Review : The Doubleday UK meme, a book a day for July 2014 , is the goad I'm using to get through my snit-based unwritten reviews. Today's prompt is the twenty-first, discuss a book you expected to hate but ended up loving. Life: a constellation of vital phenomena\u2014organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation. Yes. Now, there is always a matter of taste when it comes to appreciating or otherwise a given writer's work. Do the writer's words ring you like a bell? Do they smack you in the chops? Do they slither into your ears emitting glassy slime like a hagfish? That's the chief factor in determining your ultimate response to a work. I think some writers are equivalent of chocolatiers, making bonbon after truffle upon caramel. Lovely taken one at a time; urpsome in bulk. I think Marra is a chocolatier of a writer in this book. There is something miraculous in the way the years wash away your evidence, first you, then your friends and family, then the descendants who remember your face, until you aren\u2019t even a memory, you\u2019re only carbon, no greater than your atoms, and time will divide them as well. Mmmmm. Yum. Sing it, Brother Anthony, sing it. Invader and invaded held on to their fistfuls of earth, but in the end, the earth outlived the hands that held it. Yes. I concur. A bit baroque, permabehaps, but yes. For their entire lives, even before they met you, your mother and father held their love for you inside their hearts like an acorn holds an oak tree. Oh gag me! A milk chocolate strawberry creme-filled emetic-level Whitman's Sampler spitback! So here I was, alternately uplifted and revolted, and still...this story made me stop what I was thinking and attend to it, and that's no mean feat. The horror of stories about war is, for me, only partially touched by the battles and the soldiers and the wounds they inflict on themselves and each other. The people whose lives are utterly upended by wars fought in their name and on their land are so often simply disappeared in toponymic abstraction (eg, the Mexican-American War). This novel doesn't look so much at the war as at the warred-over place and its inhabitants. Marra's gift is in making images of the place vivid: The trees they passed repeated on and on into the woods. None was remarkable when compared to the next, but each was individual in some small regard: the number of limbs, the girth of trunk, the circumference of shed leaves encircling the base. No more than minor peculiarities, but minor particularities were what transformed two eyes, a nose, and a mouth into a face. And the people who live in the violated, wounded place: As someone whose days were defined by the ten thousand ways a human can hurt, she needed, now and then, to remember that the nervous system didn't exist exclusively to feel pain. It's a very well-made book, it's got a helluva wallop of a message, and it's fun to read. I was expecting nothing more than a flashy MFA-from-Iowa-Writers'-Workshop meretricious bauble. Some parts of the book are, in fact, that very thing. One's own taste determines where the balance point lies. Are there more surprisingly good moments than there are expectedly Shiny-Brite ones? Entire years had passed when he was rich enough in time to disregard the loose change of a minute, but now he obsessed over each one, this minute, the next minute, the one following, all of which were different terms for the same illusion.

In a hospital in Volchansk, Chechnya, on a boarded-up gash where a window once sat, a crude mural depicts the city as it had been before it was reduced to rubble. Looking at the mural the viewer is spared, for as long as she can pretend, the reality that the open space would offer: a void of destruction and death. In his astonishing debut, A Constellation of Vital Phenomena , Anthony Marra paints a mural of war so vivid in its awfulness that we tremble as we gaze, but we enter the tableau and become so caught up in the power of Marra\u2019s narrative that we tread heedlessly on the landmines of heartbreak. The war in Chechnya occurred not once but twice in our recent past. Its roots are so deep and tangled in the history of the North Caucasus region\u2014which one character tries to tell in a six-volume, 3,300-page history\u2014that most of us are helpless to identify who is fighting whom and where. Forget even trying to tackle the why. But if you can grasp that Chechnya tried to break away from Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, you\u2019ll have a glimpse of the First Chechen War. If you understand the first war obliterated the infrastructure of the country and left it vulnerable and run by corrupt warlords, then you\u2019ll have an inkling why Russia invaded a second time. But don\u2019t worry that you still don\u2019t know where this place is or why it\u2019s fought over like a scrap of meat between starving dogs. You\u2019ll get there. Be patient. Take a few minutes to Google a map of Chechnya or Wikipedia, but trust Anthony Marra help sort it out, through the graceful and tragic voices of his characters. Marra unveils a time so awful it\u2019s hard to get the head around, but with a sense of whimsy and just a touch of the surreal that the reader smiles, feeling awash with affection and hope, before being plunged again into the viscera of war. Akhmed\u2019s exchanges with Sonja are delicious. Akhmed, who is so inadequate as a physician that he does less harm by drawing portraits of the dead and missing than treating the wounded, offers his skills to Sonja, who can sew up a man\u2019s chest with dental floss. Yet she finds use for him in the hospital she runs with the assistance of an ancient nurse who speaks in the third person. Akhmed represents humanity\u2014a flawed man, but one imbued with tremendous compassion. The child he saves, Havaa\u2014the daughter of his best friend\u2014is the shining star in this constellation of survivors. Sonja\u2019s sister, Natalia, is a comet that sears past so quick and bright it takes the breath away. If you\u2019re lucky, the comet will return again in your lifetime, as Natalia does between the two wars, but know that it will burn fast and disappear while your heart is still pounding. And Sonja is the sun\u2014a strong and shining beacon of intelligence and ferocity\u2014that keeps the stars in alignment. As much as a vulnerable, tired, angry and frightened human can. It takes some time to settle into Marra\u2019s style and the jarring construction of the narrative, but let go of logic, let go of linear structure and let the characters show you what they need to tell their story. The surface story takes place over a few days in 2004, when Havaa\u2019s father is \u201cdisappeared\u201d and Akhmed takes her from their village to the nearby city of Volchansk, to shelter her in the crumbling hospital. But expect shifts of time between the first and second Chechen wars\u2014that is to say, between 1994 and 2004\u2014with a few jumps to World War II, as the nesting dolls of history are dumped out and scattered on the table. There is a steady stream of characters, each with his or her own tattered tale to represent the ancient and modern history of Chechnya, each illustrating the madness of war. War is absurd. The very idea that modern societies continue to resolve conflict with wanton destruction is beyond explanation. Regardless of our obsession with history, our pop culture fascination with wars distant and current, we seem destined to do the same thing over and over again, expecting but never achieving a different result. Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity. In this arena of the absurd are ordinary people forced to live extraordinary lives. Marra\u2019s novel reminds us why art is vital to the continuation of the human race: art keeps us human, despite our avid attempts to obliterate humanity. Art exposes history that we tune out while it\u2019s happening, because we\u2019re just trying to get through our daily lives. Ah, the irony: experiencing at our leisure\u2014with an act most of us find pleasurable (reading) \u2014a past that we couldn\u2019t make sense of when it was happening. The absurdity continues. But so does humanity. ...more She had believed happiness to be an absence of fear, of pain, of grief. But here it roared in her, as powerful as any sadness.

And yet Marra, Iowa Workshop MFA graduate and Stegner Fellow (each year I look forward to one or two great books to emerge from Stanford's lineup of talented writers and this book was one), is emboldened to write about what he does not know: war and Chechyna. (I should add that Marra did travel to Chechnya to interview survivors of this disaster). Of emotional truth. How can someone who hasn't been through war, bring the experience to the page so vividly? Like Adichie did in Half of a Yellow Sun , Marra insists upon the emotional truths of his characters: the intellectually arrogant and indomitable doctor Sonja, who runs a small hospital that would serve as a setting for this novel; the observant and inquisitive little orphan Havaa, who seeks refuge at this hospital; the diffident, yet resolute Akhmed who must protect this little girl, care for his bed-ridden wife, and remember how to be a doctor; the beautiful and downtrodden Natasha who finds it difficult to rebuild a friendship with her sister Sonja because she secretly deals with personal trauma. Of human suffering. In each section, suffering is distilled. You don't hear of Chechnya often. In fact you don't hear about the major wars of the 1990s often, because although it is a decade marred by cataclysmic events for some, those events are juxtaposed with years of prosperity for most. Most wars of the 90s haven't quite made it to the mainstream literary circles and the First and Second Chechen Wars (between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic) are included. The story unfolds seamlessly, traveling back and forth through time and place. The narration is a rare mix: sometimes so close that your heart beats through your ears, sometimes with enough distance to give you perspective, and oddly, at times even omniscient because you learn things that even the characters whose heads you're in, don't know about themselves or each other, and will never know throughout the book. Of the unpredictability of war. War is unnatural. Here, the spotlight zooms in on the unnatural things that people do during war. It will remind you of how one can never judge a survivor of war unless one has lived through the gall of it. Had it been you, what would you have done? Will you ever know? Could you even imagine? Grozny is referenced a lot: the Chechen capital which was flattened in 1994 and rebuilt. Warring groups are referred to as 'The Feds' or 'The Rebels.' Should you choose to read this novel and can't figure out which group is doing what (admittedly, this does get confusing at times) a quick read-up here might help. Of death and destruction: (this is not a spoiler, by the way) The youngest brother is the one who six months later, would be disappeared in the back of the truck, as his older brother was, who would know the landfill through his blindfolding gag by the rich scent of clay as his older brother had known, whose fingers would be wound with the electrical wires that had been welded to his older brother's wounds, who would stand above a mass grave his brother had dug, and would fall in it as his older brother had (though taking six more minutes and four more bullets to die), who would be buried in arms length of dirt above his brother, and his bones would find over time, those of his older brother. And so, at that indeterminate point in the future, answer his mother's prayer that her boys find each other wherever they go. ...more If you read as much as I do (or even if you don't), you're bound to come across a book that is hailed by literary critics and readers as one of the greatest things ever, but no matter how much you try and read it and are determined to love it, it just doesn't click for you. I know that happens most often with the classics, but it certainly happens with \"regular\" fiction and nonfiction as well. Anthony Marra's debut novel, A Constellation of Vital Phenomena, is such a book for me. Reviews have hai If you read as much as I do (or even if you don't), you're bound to come across a book that is hailed by literary critics and readers as one of the greatest things ever, but no matter how much you try and read it and are determined to love it, it just doesn't click for you. I know that happens most often with the classics, but it certainly happens with \"regular\" fiction and nonfiction as well. Anthony Marra's debut novel, A Constellation of Vital Phenomena, is such a book for me. Reviews have hailed it as everything from \"brilliant\" and \"haunting\" to \"a flash in the heavens that makes you look up and believe in miracles.\" One reviewer even said this book \"restores my faith in the future of the novel all over again.\" One day, in a snowy village in war-torn Chechnya, eight-year-old Havaa hides as Russian soldiers abduct her father, Dokka, in the middle of the night. Their kindly neighbor, Akhmed, fears the worst when he sees the soldiers setting fire to Dokka's house as they take him away, but he rescues Havaa from her hiding place. Fearing she will be discovered, Akhmed takes Havaa to the local hospital, abandoned but for one doctor, Sonja, who alone (with the help of one cantankerous nurse) has been treating all of the victims of war and illness that enter the dilapidated hospital's doors. Akhmed, who was a medical student at the very bottom of his class, promises to work as a doctor with Sonja to ensure Havaa is provided for. Sonja comes with her own set of issues, most notably her sister, Natasha, who has continuously disappeared and reappeared in Sonja's life, but has been missing for some time. And Akhmed is caring for his own bedridden wife, and worrying about his neighbor and childhood friend, who is an informant for the Russians. But Sonja and Akhmed forge a reluctant partnership, one which opens both of their eyes to the surprising connections that tie them together. For me, while there's no doubt that Marra is a tremendously talented writer who has created some memorable characters and some beautiful sentences, this book just didn't click the way I hoped it would. It's a very dense story\u2014in order to give gravity to his narrative, Marra packs a great deal of Chechen history and details that seemed to run on for far too long. The book takes place over a 10-year-period, and switches perspectives frequently and abruptly. And although he weaves all of his storylines together at the end, before that point I wondered why he spent so much time dwelling on certain details about secondary characters. I'm not usually an outlier in this fashion; I usually like books more than others. So if the story and people's reviews make this book sound like one you think you'd love, have at it. And then perhaps we can discuss what I'm missing. ...more It took me a little time to get into this book.

The threads of the different characters' stories eventually wove together in an astonishingly effective (and affecting) way. I felt connected to them, and I also felt very strongly their connections to each other. It was ultimately one of the most moving novels I've ever read. In an interview I read upon finishing this book, Anthony Marra said that because he couldn't find any novels about Chechnya, wrote the novel he wanted to read. So A Constellation of Vital Phemomena is a gift he gave to himself, but, for the same reason, it's a gift he's given to the rest of us as well. It's a glimpse of some incredibly dark days in a country many of us will never visit, but its beauty and humanity are heartening and unforgettable. I'm so glad I gave this book a chance to work its magic on me. ...more This is a book that made me pause, reflect and pause again. To say this was an excellent book would be an understatement.

Anthony Marra takes a subject and a place I for one knew very little about, war-ravaged Chechnya in 2004, more than a decade after the fall of the Soviet Union. The story centres on a war ridden village that most people have deserted. The central characters lives are interconnected in unexpected ways that we learn more about as the we turn the pages. The reader is introduced to what life is like in an ethnic war zone of a mostly unknown place especially for me, so I was eager to read and learn something new. This is certainly not a light read but having said that the story is told with a surprising and unexpected amount of humour. I did laugh out loud a couple of times in the novel s and the following was one such time. \"I thought Ronald McDonald was president.\" Or maybe that Ronald McDonald told Gorbachev to tear down the wall (\"You're thinking of Ronald Reagan,\" she tells him). At other times I found myself flinching at some of the descriptions and atrocities of war. The book is not a history lesson about the Chechnya wars but rather a story about people who lived and coped through the ordeal. I did Google quite a bit about Chechnya while reading this story as I like to have some facts in order to understand what I am reading and I especially like to have a map to hand. I did find the story initially a challenge to follow. The chapters go back and forth between events and years. It took me a while to get a grasp on names, times and places. Overall a very interesting and well told story. I would advise if reading the book to Google a small bit on Chechnya as I certainly felt it helped me while reading the story. ...more I didn't like Anthony Marra's A Constellation of Vital Phenomena but I could not put it down.

Marra's fictional work got right in my face, history as seen from the civilians living this life, the personalization of war and all its horrors. A Constellation of Vital Phenomena is presented to us in non-linear alternating time lines from 1994-2004. This allows Marra to flesh out the point of view of his main six narrators. He does this beautifully and we always know where we are in time and which character is speaking. I really appreciated this. A Constellation of Vital Phenomena begins in 2004 when the Feds burn the house of Akhmed's neighbor Dokka. Dokka becomes one of the so-called disappeared but who is left behind is his daughter, eight-year-old Havaa. Akhmed rescues Havaa from her hiding place in the woods and then must find her a safe place to live, certainly not his own home that he shares with his ill wife Ula. He takes Havaa to the only place he can think of, a war torn hospital and a doctor he knows only by reputation of sewing up a man's chest with dental floss. This doctor, Sonja Andreyevna Rabina reluctantly agrees to harbor Havaa in exchange for Akhmed's agreement to work at the hospital. The intertwining of the lives of these and the other characters is told in 400+ gut wrenching pages, interspersed with sparks of humor that somehow keep spirit alive under horrific conditions. Thank heavens for these glimpses of hope. I don't think I came away with a clearer understanding of the Chechnya wars but I can put a face to the people. Isn't this what it comes down to in the end? The people? I didn't like A Constellation of Vital Phenomena but I wouldn't have missed it for anything. A superior debut!

Most novels feature characters who are familiar to us in some ways. Varra\u2019s characters on the other hand are far more eccentric than anyone I know. And that\u2019s their charm, they are creations of a brilliant imagination. On the surface this is about the Chechan war but really it\u2019s about relationships within families and between friends. Especially moving is the depiction of the difficult relationship between two sisters and the equally fraught relationship of a father with his informer son. The eight year old Havaa and the reader\u2019s concern for her continuing safety is the emotional heart of the novel. In short, a brilliant achievement, difficult to begin with but ultimately immensely rewarding and inspired story telling. ...more I don't know what to say about this book. I feel utterly broken.
