However it seemed bizarre it worked excessively well but what adam did with his new art, Let\u2019s go to bed , he said to eve. Typical. Ok, ok he probably couldn\u2019t say how lovely dressed you are since they were naked, but still, though they hadn\u2019t bed too, I guess. Anyway, they went to bed and had children: cain, abel and set, though about the latter we mention only from chronicler duty since he is neither here nor there in that story. And Cain killed Abel what is commonly known even to these one not familiar with Genesis and what is not known is the way Saramago retold the story of hapless Cain, the first assassin in world history. According to Saramago Cain was condemned to wander for ever about the world and due to that could participate in stories described in Old Testament and see with own eyes burning of Sodoma and Gomora, for what he did hate the Lord wholeheartedly, destroying the Babel Tower, sacrificing Isaac by Abraham or trials of Job to finish his journey on the Noah's Ark. And all the way he would challenge and undermine God's authority and his decisions. The history of mankind is the history of our misunderstandings with god, for he doesn\u2019t understand us, and we don\u2019t understand him . Novel, written in typical for Saramago style with long digressive sentences without punctuation and unconventional approach to the subject is witty, wonderfully quizzical, filled with blasphemous statements. And though that looks like some light reading nonetheless it leaves us with some uncomfortable questions and unwanted truths. It challenges us to consider nature of good and evil, free will, morality, determinism and responsibility for own deeds. God from Old Testament is neither kind-hearted nor forgiving old fellow. He is demanding and punishing, vengeful and unjust. Given the terrible lot of Sodoma and Gomora, burnt to the ground, did Lord find women guilty too, and if so, what about the children, Cain would ask. Your mistake is to assume that guilt is understood in the same way by god and by men . If God is that omniscient how is it even possible the world is as it is, we could ask. Are we only a plaything in his hands, a wager in his neverending struggle with Satan ? the innocent are now accustomed to paying for the sinners, The lord seems to have a very strange idea of justice . ...more The life of a god isn\u2019t as easy as you think, said God to Cain. When Cain meets an angel and enters into an argument about the oblation god has ordered Abraham to make of his own son, the angel, feeling trapped, mutters under his breath, Oh no, a rationalist, and tries to sneak away to complete the divine mission with which he\u2019s charged.

The hero or an The life of a god isn\u2019t as easy as you think, said God to Cain. When Cain meets an angel and enters into an argument about the oblation god has ordered Abraham to make of his own son, the angel, feeling trapped, mutters under his breath, Oh no, a rationalist, and tries to sneak away to complete the divine mission with which he\u2019s charged. The angel might have turned a deaf ear to Cain\u2019s cold logic, but you, the angelic reader, have no recourse but to subject yourself to his grilling. The hero or anti-hero of this story, depending on one\u2019s point of view, is none but Cain, Adam\u2019s other son, the first murderer, the embodiment of evil, transformed for the purpose into the author\u2019s rationalist alter ego, shredding to bits the moral fabric Biblical history is made of, with the confidence of a devil and the precision of an infallible angel. Saramago\u2019s purpose here is not to tell us something new; we have heard all that before. Nor is there an attempt to engage the rationalist and the religionist on a profounder philosophical level. Instead, he takes to task the sacred and the revered through the felicitous agency of satire, just that this time it is caustic, hilarious, direct, with no attempt at subtlety, with a delicious tongue-smacking of an irreverent blasphemer, the title he earned for writing this story. In any case, it\u2019s guaranteed to amuse you or enrage you, depending, again, on your point of view! As I read on I couldn\u2019t help recalling Voltaire\u2019s Candide in which chance compels a young and intelligent man to traverse the earth in search of some universal dicta that would help him answer questions about life. Likewise our protagonist Cain, carrying a curse by god as punishment for unjustly killing his brother, is condemned to travel between places and ages, and like Machado de Assis\u2019 Br\u00e1s Cubas, he goes beyond the confines of human time to meet various Biblical characters and sees the history, as crystallised in the Old Testament, unfold before his sinful eyes. Be it Moses\u2019 genocidal campaigns on god\u2019s behest or the gambler\u2019s wager between god and satan for Job\u2019s test of patience, whether it\u2019s the total annihilation of Sodom & Gomorrah for \u2013 guess what \u2013 homosexuality or the essentially immoral tale of god, like an insane ruler, ordering Abraham to put to sword his own son as a \u201ctest\u201d of his faith, the more Cain goes around the more evidence he sees of god\u2019s wickedness and irrationality, amazed at the games he plays with humans he created to prove his superiority and uniqueness, perhaps in a bawdy attempt to escape his own ennui or to placate his inflated divine ego. On the last stop in Cain\u2019s journey before the curtain falls he meets Noah and hears of god\u2019s grand plan to destroy all of humanity except Noah\u2019s family and those who manage to clamber upon the ark. Turning over in his head the mountain of evidence of god\u2019s evil ways Cain tells Noah: \u201cI have learned one thing, What\u2019s that, That our god, the creator of heaven and earth, is completely mad, \u2026innocent are now accustomed to paying for the sinners, the lord seems to have a very strange idea of justice, the idea of someone who hasn\u2019t the slightest notion of what human justice might be.\u201d All in all, there are lots of chuckles and gasps to be had here, in signature Saramago style.

Saramago\u2019s Cain is a disappointed man. And it is his disappointment that has created all his troubles. Granted, there was jealousy in the deed for which he is known. But at the root of the jealousy there was a drive towards god. And there lies the disappointment. The story then becomes a quixotic quest (for there is always an explicit quixotic element in Saramago\u2019s characters \u2013 part of Saramago\u2019s mark) as Cain searches through the holy book for the presence of the love and justice that he expects out of his god. And the search turns out to be quixotic indeed.

We all know that Cain was the firstborn of Adam and Eve. He was a farmer and he killed Abel, the first human to die, because of jealousy due to later being more favored by God. That made him the first human murderer and he was condemned by God and made him roam the earth forever.

He was a farmer and he killed Abel, the first human to die, because of jealousy due to later being more favored by God.

This book, the last book completed by Nobel laureate Jose de Suosa Saramago (1922-2010) before his death, Cain is about him and his journey after the killing. Like Forrest Gump, the wandering Cain of Saramago witnessed the important events during his lifetime that seemed to be forever. Well, some people in the Old Testament lived almost a thousand years. Cain here was there during the attempted killing of Isaac by his father Abraham, the trials of Job, Moses finding his people worshiping Baal, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Great Flood, etc. Just like Saramago's earlier work The Gospel According to Jesus Christ (3 stars), this book takes Saramago's no-holds-barred interpretations of biblical stories that we are all familiar with. Unlike the type of interpretations that are supposed to inspire you to being better human beings, Saramago's works make you think and smile. Think because Saramago pries into the bible-truths that we thought we should not question when we were young because those were how your catechists told you to interpret them. Think because if you apply common sense, probably if you are not a biblical scholar like me, chances are, you would be amazed on how Saramago thought of those spins and twists. Also, his works make you smile because some of his dialogues, particularly those arguments between God and Cain are outright funny because after Cain was cursed by God, Cain felt that he was God's equal and he could say what he wanted to say to Him. The result is like God and Cain arguing endlessly like two eager-beaver college debaters. Highly recommended to all Saramago's fans. ...more Tenho andado a ler os livros que me restam a conta-gotas, tenho pavor de chegar ao fim sabendo que quem escreveu estes n\u00e3o estar\u00e1 por c\u00e1 para escrever novos.

Previously, I've been uninspired by \"The History of the Siege of Lisboa\" and \"The Double\": the acrobatics leading to nothing but small stories with tiny miracles in 'em. But, at last, the subject seems to fit the writer's own predilections: of making long streaming sentences (a trick of Garcia Marquez as well) build entire tableaus in the roving mind. And the tableaus here range from ghastly to heavenly, as god and satan himself (notice the lack of capitalization, as if everything, EVERYTHING biblical has a shadiness of apocrypha) battle it out. This one reminds me of \"Memnoch the Devil\" by Anne Rice (indeed, her newer \"Angel Time\" also deals with \"alternative presents\": the various adventures that Cain, not the killer of society but the independent hero, experiences). Finally, the hokeyness of Saramago (a.k.a. time travel of biblical figures) is minimized to more accessible levels. Ironically, writing about these grand themes finally becomes his most personal and worthwhile work. *CAIN is his final novel ...more In 'Cain', published just a few months before Saramago\u2019s death, the author gets to argue with God one last time.

But weren\u2019t there any In 'Cain', published just a few months before Saramago\u2019s death, the author gets to argue with God one last time. On this occasion his jibes are aimed the god of the Old Testament, who, as we all know, is an easy target. This god is cruel, proud, jealous, vindictive, inconsistent and often simply petty. Saramago hires Cain to call out god on all his sins and errors beginning with Cain\u2019s own sorry story which made him go down in history as the first murderer of the worst kind. But weren\u2019t there any extenuations? After all, it\u2019s god who started it. He was the one that created that unhealthy sibling rivalry between Abel and Cain by asking them for offerings and judging them. Abel, who took care of livestock brought a nice juicy lamb, and Cain who was a farmer brought god veggies. Sadly, god was not a vegetarian so he snubbed Cain\u2019s offering each and every time. OK, so Cain overreacted. Murder is never the answer. But maybe god should take some of the responsibility, too? This is the question that is being asked many times throughout this little book. Cain, condemned to endless wandering, appears whenever and wherever god\u2019s actions are questionable. What sort of god asks someone to kill their beloved son to prove some stupid point? And isn\u2019t killing against god\u2019s very own commandments? Saramago reveals that it was actually Cain himself who stopped Abraham from killing Isaac as the angel sent on that mission was running late. Back when I was a good church going little girl I remember that story scared me the most. I was surprised it was never mentioned how Isaac felt about the fact that his dad just tried to kill him. Here is how it went according to Saramago: \u201cIsaac asked, Father, whatever did I do to you that would make you want to kill me, your only son, You did nothing wrong, Isaac, So why did you want to cut my throat as if I were a lamb, asked the boy, if that man, may the lord\u2019s blessings be upon him, hadn\u2019t come and grabbed your arm, you would now be carrying home a corpse, It was lord\u2019s idea, he meant it as a test, A test of what, Of my faith and my obedience, What kind of lord would order a father to kill his own son, He\u2019s the only lord we have, the lord of our ancestors, the lord who was here when we were born, And if that lord had a son, would he ordered him to be killed as well, asked Isaac, Time will tell.\u201d And what about the children of Sodom and Gomorrah? Surely they were innocent, weren\u2019t they? And that whole Job business, that really was unnecessarily cruel. If any human were to test anybody\u2019s love that way they would\u2019ve been deemed psychopathic. Not to mention that replacing all the children of Job whom god killed with new children does not actually make it ok. And so it goes, whenever god acts up comes Cain to ask the uncomfortable questions. Sometimes they are big things like just why exactly would god help certain tribes in their battles by killing thousands of people? Sounds rather bloodthirsty. Other times they are just minor inconsistencies \u2013 if Lot was so drunk that he passed out and had no idea his daughters were having sex with him, how did he manage to get it up? Throughout the book Cain gets angrier and angrier with god, until he finally finds himself on the Ark with Noah and decides it\u2019s time for revenge which is where the story ends. 'Cain' is a funny little allegory but I couldn\u2019t help but be saddened a little by how disappointed Saramago seemed to be with both god and the humankind. Nonetheless, it\u2019s hard to disagree with him even if his jokes seem almost juvenile occasionally. I came to similar conclusions when I was nine and they explained to me that we must worship god all the time, otherwise he would get angry and send us to hell.

The most remarkable aspect of the work isn\u2019t its content but its use of a time-travelling Cain who can peek in on various biblical episodes from Abraham\u2019s preparation to murder his son Isaac, to the annihilation of the residents, children included, of Sodom and Gomorrah, to Joshua\u2019s divinely sanctioned genocide of the Midianites and their neighbours, to the pointless torture of Job, to all of the gore and dispossession in between. Cain therefore has a sort of synoptic view, to anticipate the New Testament term, from which he reports the violence, irritability, irrationality, ruthlessness, injustice and simply arbitrary imposition of misery on the world by the Lord. The character of the God of the Torah has been problematic since at least the time of Christ. For Christians, because the intellectual and moral chasm between the perpetually vengeful Yahweh and the perpetually loving Father of Jesus appears to be unbridgeable. For Jews, because by the time of Christ the rabbinate was preaching a sermon of love and forgiveness almost indistinguishable from the gospels of Jesus. From time to time, theologians have attempted to square this divine circle by claiming mitigating circumstances - the distinctly illiberal caste of ancient cultures, for example, or the possible inability of human minds to deal with the full monty of revelation all at once. None of these rationalisations work out terribly well, mostly they just open the way for a free for all interpretation of \u2018inerrant\u2019 scripture and further heresy; or they promote the equally worrisome idea of \u2018continuing revelation\u2019 which neither dogmatic Jews or Christians - with the exception of the Mormons - can tolerate. The second century heretic Marcion took some understandable action - not long after the publication of the love-imbued (and anti-semitic) Gospel of John - by simply rejecting the Jewish scriptures in their entirety. The Protestant reformer, John Calvin, took the opposite tack and preached the justified vengeance of a wilful and arbitrary God on a sin-infected, unworthy creation. The only time the controversy subsides is when believers simply choose to ignore the all too obvious contradictions. Catholics do this as a matter of principle, accepting both divine love and vengeance as a \u2018mystery\u2019, thus putting the problem beyond recognition much less discussion. Liberal rabbis generally grab for the nearest shibboleth on the inscrutability of the divine mind. And this equivocation is something Saramago will not tolerate. The God of the Torah is clearly insane. This would be only a dogmatic issue of sectarian importance if it weren\u2019t for the fact that this God has been a perennial role model of leadership from Joshua to Donald Trump - You\u2019re with me or against me; There is no partial loyalty; Nothing stands in the way of achieving one\u2019s personal objectives; Ruthless persistence at any cost is a virtue etc. This is a God who justifies violence and deceit and patent injustice as a matter of divine right. Cain summarises the situation: \u201cBurning sodom and gomorrah to the ground had evidently not been enough for the lord, for here, at the foot of mt sinai, was clear, irrefutable proof of his wickedness, three thousand men killed simply because he was angered by the creation of a supposed rival in the form of a golden calf. I killed one brother and the lord punished me, who, I would like to know, is going to punish the lord for all these deaths, thought cain, lucifer was quite right when he rebelled against god, and those who say he did so out of envy are wrong, he simply recognised god's evil nature.\u201d This is the God of War and very little else. Saramago wants us to remember this. ...more The Bible is a playground of stories, of characters, of parables, of moral dilemmas. Some take it literally, the WORD OF GOD. Some think it nonsense. Highly entertaining nonsense. But nonsense nonetheless. Saramago, in this his final work, thinks it nonsense. He has tapped this mine before, in The Gospel According to Jesus Christ , but here he goes again, telling the story of Cain and Abel but then projecting Cain as an observer and sometime participant on other Bible stories. Thus: Cain shows up The Bible is a playground of stories, of characters, of parables, of moral dilemmas. Some take it literally, the WORD OF GOD. Some think it nonsense. Highly entertaining nonsense. But nonsense nonetheless. Saramago, in this his final work, thinks it nonsense. He has tapped this mine before, in The Gospel According to Jesus Christ , but here he goes again, telling the story of Cain and Abel but then projecting Cain as an observer and sometime participant on other Bible stories. Thus: Cain shows up and disrupts Abraham\u2019s slaying of his son Isaac, forced to act because the Angel of the Lord got delayed ( Abe said, \"Man, you must be putting me on!\" ); he watches innocent children slaughtered at Sodom; he does the Tower of Babel and Moses and the Golden Calf. Cain is there when God and Satan make a bet to see if Job will lose his religion if they destroy his life. (I think John Landis worked this vignette into a movie many years later, when Wall Street magnates Mortimer and Randolph Duke decide to make a similar $1 bet over the life of Louis Winthorpe III). Cain, a wanderer by divine fiat, moseys up on Noah and his sons at their ark building and, learning of the Lord\u2019s intentions of drowning every human being except the saintly Noah clan in order to rid the world of human evil, correctly predicts that God will fare no better in this do-over than he did the first time. Simple enough, right? Saramago makes literary fun of Bible stories, showing that the Biblical god is petulant, vengeful, murderous, unjust, often forgetful and almost humanly fallible. So, believers can humph, and haters gonna hate. But wait. There\u2019s one \u2018story\u2019 in here that is not strictly from the Bible. At least not the Bible as I remember it. (Some minor spoilers follow). After Cain murders his brother (because the Lord would not accept Cain\u2019s offerings), the Lord puts a \u2018mark\u2019 on Cain\u2019s forehead and sentences him to a life of wandering. He winds up enslaved in the palace of Queen Lilith and her husband Noah. His first job there is mud treader. Which is a pretty shitty job. But Queen Lilith takes a shine to him and makes him her bedchamber slave boytoy. Cain finds this happier work than mudtreading. Saramago sets up this switch in duties beautifully with this passage: Like everything else, words have their whys and wherefores. Some call to us solemnly, arrogantly, giving themselves airs, as if they were destined for great things, and then it turns out that they were nothing more than a breeze too light even to set the sail of a windmill moving, whereas other ordinary, habitual words, the sort you use every day end up having consequences no one would have dared predict, they weren\u2019t born for that and yet they shook the world. The overseer said, Enter. Yes, a simple word. Enter. But what are we, the readers, entering. There is no Biblical character named Lilith. In Isaiah , however, in a description of some desolate, chaotic land, we hear, \u201cWildcats shall meet hyenas, / Goat-demons shall greet each other; / There too the lilith shall repose / And find herself a resting place\u201d. I know. I don\u2019t know either. People with more time on their hands have thought about this though. Medieval Jewish folklorists thus have posited that Lilith is Adam\u2019s first wife. Goethe, Browning, George MacDonald and a whole lot of painters have worked the whole Lilith angle. In an article in Bible History Daily * entitled Lilith: Seductress, Heroine or Murderer , Janet Howe Gaines writes, \u201cIrish novelist James Joyce cast her as the \u201cpatron of abortions.\u201d Modern feminists celebrate her bold struggle for independence from Adam. Her name appears as the title of a Jewish women\u2019s magazine and a national literacy program. An annual music festival that donates its profits to battered women\u2019s shelters and breast cancer research institutes is called the Lilith Fair.\u201d Saramago paints her, instead, as a nymphomaniac. I apologize here, because I don\u2019t usually go all Wiki in my reviews. I just couldn\u2019t help myself doing a little research. I got confused because Lilith\u2019s cuckold husband was named Noah, but seemingly a different Noah from the famous shipbuilder. Or the same. Or. ________ So God speaks: My power is absolute, limitless\u2026the only person I have to account to is myself\u2026I never have to concern myself with considerations of a personal nature\u2026I am endowed , let me say this to you now, with a conscience so flexible that it agrees with whatever I do. But Cain sees all this. And he sees the future clearly. We are His image going forward, ya know. And thanks to this re-imagining, Cain is on the Ark. There are just these few folks left. It isn\u2019t like Cain hasn\u2019t killed before. He can end this right now. Save a lot of CNN headlines. God destroyed Sodom, innocent children slaughtered along with the fetishists. I read this this week as innocent children were slaughtered while waiting for their parents to finish a race. It is likely they too are collateral damage in God\u2019s Will. *No, I am not a subscriber. ...more \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u063a\u0648 \u0641\u064a

This book shows us what Cain did next. We see him pass through many of the key events of the Old Testament. He is there for example at the testing of Job, the razing of the walls of Jericho and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Throughout he is in dialogue with God. He understands not how the God of love and justice can be capricious, spiteful, jealous and uncaring - or as Tim Minchin memorably put Cain kills his brother Abel in a fit of jealousy and is forced to wander the earth in penance.

I liked the gentle humour, it reminded me a little of Vonnegut at his best, and for me there can be no greater accolade.

Weed out all the boring parts of Genesis, feature all the greatest hits, and place cain as the ubiquitous character. Actually, cain even shows up at events that god is too distracted to attend (and his angels are stuck in traffic?). In addition to being an erudite little gem, this story is full of slicing irony mixed with slapstick humor and dry, bone-dry, desert-dry wit. He's too subtle to just rant on the lord. Saramago seems to be peeking out of the corners of the pages, winking at the reader, offering a sly smile. As an arch example, Eve calls herself the First Lady of Paradise. Saramago, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998, was an ardent atheist, who said that the Bible is a handbook of bad morals. He also impugns a \"cruel, jealous, and inhumane God (who) exists only in our heads.\" In 1992, a scandal erupted after The Gospel According to Jesus Christ was published, whose characterization of God didn't conform to certain pieties, so Saramago happily moved to the Spanish Canary Islands, where he lived until his death in 2010. He didn't think CAIN would offend Catholics, though, \"because they don't read the Bible.\" This is his final contribution to the world of literature. Although not his most superlative--by definition it is contained--it is still masterful, and had me laughing with glee at intervals. Check out his 1995 Blindness for a novel of unsurpassed beauty, staggering tragedy, and stunning redemption. ...more I've just read some pages, and I surely can envision much to come, of the same .

(2) God corrected later a lack of belly button;yes, for procreation purposes. He sparsely visited the couple, because he had other paradises to visit. God expells them from paradise after they had disobeyed; Eve said:\u201da serpent fooled me\u201d in a dream; she ate from the Tree of Life; Adam too. So my present thesis is:this is truly a manual on how to mock God*. Yes, I will continue reading, to unravel the Cain issue. \u00bb\u00ab Adam and Eve now live in a cave\u2026nearby four rivers. Adam and Eve are hungry; Eve volunteers to get fruit from paradise garden; she meets with the Cherubim Azael**: asks him some fruit; he\u2019s reluctant but then will provide her with some fruits. Later Adam and Eve would meet with the cherubim: he tells them: you\u2019re not alone; soon they will get a ride from a caravan. Adam and Eve are portrayed as being of black hair and dark skin; but their children, Abel and Cain, are different; Abel being blond, Saramago hints at the rendezvous between Eve and the angel of Eden. Abel and Cain have different vocations; they offer a sacrifice to God; God is pleased with Abel, but despises Cain\u2019s; Abel mocks Cain; Cain kills Abel; Cain wanted to kill God. God will punish Cain: he\u2019s condemned to become a wanderer\u2026and gets a mark in his forehead. The Cain sign. \u00bb\u00bb\u00ab\u00ab \u201cO diabo que te assinalou algum defeito encontrou\u201d. Cain gets to Nod land; he doesn\u2019t say his name is Cain; he says he\u2019s Abel (!!); he manages to get two jobs: one as clay worker and another at the palace of the governess of Nod: Lilith, the wife of Noah. Noah is jealous about that second job. . Noah\u2019s men try to kill Cain, but due to his sign they aren\u2019t succeeded. The above mentioned palace was not like Mafra or Versailles... or Buckingham's. Certainly not. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab \"O senhor n\u00e3o \u00e9 pessoa em que se possa confiar\". Now Cain tells Lilith his true name.She asks him to kill Noah. He refuses.Lilith is pregnant.Cain departures to a new,green land. There he meets with Abraham,about to sacrifice his son Isaac to God. Not the angel...,but Cain saves the boy! Here I laughed.I am still laughing: the angel got late,due to a mechanical problem... in the wing (!!!).So Cain got the laurels. Haha. ... ... Hahaha. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab Riding a donkey Cain arrives to the place where the Babel Tower was being built; but people are in total disagreement: they speak different languages,...they looked crazy. Cain asks a man who speaks Hebrew like him:how come?; the man replied: they all spoke the \"Tongue\",the same for everybody...but then God visited them, and didn't like the Tower; so, he confused the languages; God was jealous of men.(!!!!) ah!! Cain reveals that he's got a special (supernatural?) ability: he can travel in time: back and forward. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab Allow me to abbreviate. -Cain reports on Sodom and Gomorra: fire and sulfur rain falls upon the cities\u2026. Lot\u2019s wife turning into a statue of salt. The same merciless God who didn\u2019t save the children. -Moses 40 days and 40 nights on the Sinai;\u2026 now Cain says he\u2019s Noah; God gets his revenge on people for their adoration of the golden calf. Cain leaves because he\u2019s sick about bloodshed. -Joshua and Jericho\u2019s walls that fell after the sound of the trumpets\u2026 Cain says the stopping of the sun is a lie . Noah is building the Arc because God wants to exterminate men ,\u2026in a land full of inequities; Cain joins Noah\u2019s family\u2026.but exposes God's ignorance on the Archimedes principle.(!!!) The flood:40 days and nights of rain. After 150 days, water level starts receding. Noah had seen an unicorn; really: all animals in the ark?. The ark had no sail... nor engine. By the end of the book: all humans are dead...but Cain. Noah committed suicide. Saramago took pity on Cain:\u201ddespite the murder, Cain is an intrinsically honest man\u2026with moral sense\u201d. I would say Cain looks godlike godish . His forehead sign is becoming bigger. Like a black sun . * Saramago interviewed by Spanish EFE; he was 86 years old and he said: \u201cDios no es una persona de fiar\u2026no estoy questionando Dios, \u2026la humanidad que lo ha inventado\u201d; \"God is not a trustworthy person...I am not questioning God...but mankind that has invented God\". **Jewish legend speaks of Azazel as the angel who refused to bow down to Adam. For such refusal, Azazel was thenceforth dubbed \"the accursed Satan\".....Azazel refused,contending \"why should a son of fire (an angel) fall down before a son of clay (a mortal)\". Whereupon God cast Azazel out of Heaven....
