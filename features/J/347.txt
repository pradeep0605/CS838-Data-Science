What I love the most in this ser Final rating: 3.5/5 stars \u201cI told you. You own me. I'm yours. All that I have been. All that I am. All that I will ever be. Your happiness is mine. Your fury is mine. And your needs will be met before mine. I love you, and to me, that means placing you first and giving to you what I will never give to another. Power over me.\u201d Considering how much I love this series, this time i can only say this: Could have been better. I had high expectations of this book. What I love the most in this series is a wide array of different characters and great world building. Now that I have finally read the third book in the series, I feel a bit disappointed. Mostly because of the characters, since the story was very good (<---B>but only last 40% actually</---B>) Now, I will write out the problems I've had with it: \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 First: The world building for this whole series is great. But, this book didn't focus on it at all. Except for a bit more information on Phoenix, and appearance of one Demon Prince, it wasn't really important because of the love story in the middle of it. \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 Second: I wasn't very fond of the characters - which is sad. I like Thane, but sometimes it just felt like I was reading about a completely different character. On the other hand, I didn't like heroine Elin. I don't know, but I just didn't fall for their chemistry, i guess? Not to mention there was an insta-lust of which I am not really fond of. \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 Third: I enjoyed more reading about secondary story and characters than reading about the main characters and their story. So yes, I was pretty much bored for half of the book. But overall, the last 40% were better than the first 60, where finally things started to happen. The beginning of the book left me a bit confused, so i quickly reread all the parts with Thane, Xerxes and Bjorn in the previous book, which had helped a lot (considering how it ended with cliffhanger in previous book). ____________________________________________ CHARACTERS : ____________________________________________ \u2666 Thane: Thane is the leader of \"Thane, Bjorn and Xerxes\" trio and also the boss of his club Downfall. He is one of the Sent Ones from the Army of Disgrace, under direct command of Zacharel. After the emotional trauma he experienced in the captivity by demons, he learned that he enjoyed inflicting pain on others and experiencing it himself (he is basically SM). He doesn't want to bond with anyone, or sleep with anyone more than once, until one Phoenix, Kendra, screws him up by changing her shape into different women he slept with and ultimately bonding with him, making him her slave the moment he killed her (since she is a Phoenix, she can resurrect, every time stronger than before). And this is exactly how the book starts, with him being a mindless slave of Kendra. Until Elin, another slave, helps him remember who he is and saves his life. I like Thane, really. I was always interested in his character, and when I saw he was getting his book, I was delighted. Except, of course, something happened and Thane didn't give off the same air as Thane before. Well, that is actually a good change, since it was positive, but he very easily changed his moods and he sometimes really irritated me, like the fact that he is judgmental and maybe too obsessed with Elin. Too obsessed means trouble, right? Anyway, his relationship with Elin went into total different direction - the fact that he showed that he could be someone else with her was interesting, but so out of his character, i don't really know how to explain it. \u2666 Elin: Elin Vane is the heroine of our story. She is a halfling = half human, half Phoenix. She was married to a human Bay, and lived with her mother and father. Her mother was pure blood Phoenix and was married to a human. Everything was well and great, until Phoenix clan found them. They killed Elin's father and husband and took her mother and Elin to their camp and made them into slaves. After a while, her mother died too and Elin was left alone. Her life was suddenly utter catastrophe, being forced to act like an animal, being constant target of punishments and humiliated all the time. But then she saw the opportunity to escape in the Sent One they had captured. I didn't really like Elin, I couldn't even love her. Mostly because she gave the air of being immature. I never enjoyed reading her POVs, even though, in the end, she became stronger and bolder heroine. Maybe it was the writing style that made me dislike her, because, to me, it didn't feel like i was reading about the woman who was once married and who has 21 years - instead it felt like i was reading about a horny teenager from young adult novels. \u2666 Bjorn and Xerxes: Thane, Bjorn and Xerxes have a special bond. Being captured by demons, not so long ago, made them all mentally and emotionally unstable, but they still try their best to function like they should. Except sometimes, that isn't enough and their only comfort is each other. After Bjorn's sudden disappearance in the previous book, he is back, but with secrets he cannot disclose with his brothers. He has to disappear from time to time, and whenever he comes back, he is in worse shape than ever before, which greatly worries Thane and Xerxes. I want to know more about these two, so I hope they will get their books as well. \u2666 Everyone else: There were plenty of Lords of the Underworld characters, and sadly, i haven't read their books so i couldn't connect them (and i believe i would have enjoyed reading about them in these books, had i known them) (i am interested in Lucien and William the most). I am interested in that McCadden guy, and i can't figure out if he belongs in LoU universe or in this one. If he is from this one, then I really want to know more about him in the upcoming books. I liked the girls from the club Octavia, Chanel, Savy and Bellorie. Adrian was interesting as well (although I just can't remember if he had appeared before, but I guess he had). Of course, there was also someone who irritated the hell out of me and it was Kendra, the Phoenix. She wanted revenge on Thane for many things and she delighted into having him submit to her and do what she wanted. Until Thane escaped and made her life miserable, once again. I don't pity her at all, in fact I despise her as much as Thane does. ____________________________________________ OVERALL : ____________________________________________ Even though i was disappointed with this book, and even though I probably won't remember much about it, i still have high hopes for this series because all of the precious angels that have yet to get their books (like Xerxes, Bjorn and Axel) - i want to read their stories, no matter how they turn out to be. ____________________________________________ \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf ____________________________________________ MY ANGELS OF THE DARK REVIEWS: \u25c9 Wicked Nights (Angels of the Dark, #1) \u25c9 Beauty Awakened (Angels of the Dark, #2) \u25c9 <+++>Burning Dawn</+++> (Angels of the Dark, #3) ...more Fav Scene: \"Trembling fingers stroked over his feathers in a single, innocent moment of communion, flooding him with sensations he'd never before experienced.

I love Gena soooo much and her works never disappoint. Burning Dawn just became one of my favorite books. For real, this was one of her best books and having read most of her books I know what I\u2019m talking about! I\u2019ve been waiting so long for this book. Ever since I read Beauty Awakened I\u2019ve been \u201cpatiently\u201d waiting for this one. Kendra, a powerful seductive Phoenix, has captured Thane and is using him as a slave, bound to do everything she wishes. Elin sweet Elin, is also a slave to the Phoenix camp and seeing Thane gives her hope that she\u2019ll one day be free. So, Elin decides to free Thane thinking he\u2019ll rescue her as well. Elin gets her wish but Thane is consumed by his need to revenge the phoenix. Not just Kendra but all of them\u2026 I loved, loved this book. Thane was nothing as I expected him to be. His consumed by his need for revenge but at the same time he wants to win Elin\u2019s affection. He was such an \u201cambiguous character\u201d. He\u2019s strong, determined, unpredictable, scarred, will do anything to get his revenge but he\u2019s also admirable, led by his love for Elin and his friends, Bjorn and Xerxes. Above all he\u2019s loyal and he\u2019d sacrifice his own happiness if that meant his friends would find their own. Thane is not the monster he thinks he is. In my opinion, I think that he\u2019s perfect. He tries so hard to be good for the people he loves that he doesn\u2019t realize how \u201cnoble\u201d he is. On the other hand, Elin was not the typical \u201cGena-heroine\u201d. She wasn\u2019t that strong, she wan\u2019t that powerful and she wasn\u2019t that brave. When I first read about her I was like \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me! That\u2019s not Thane\u2019s match\u201d. However, as I kept reading I realized that she indeed was. Elin changes throughout the book. I can\u2019t even compare the Elin in the beginning of the book and the Elin in the end of it. She was independent, strong and funny. I felt so bad for her, for the horrors she had to endure. But that made her stronger and more compassionate. Gena did well with Thane and Elin\u2019s pairing. They completed each other and in the end healed themselves. As far as the secondary characters are concerned, I loved Xerxes and Bjorn. They were loyal to each other and they shared the same past with Thane. They had to endure horrible things, but managed to escape and survive together. They were major part of the book and they totally supported each other. I loved the fact that they were all so \u201cunited\u201d. Fav chat: (view spoiler) [ Bjorn: Distracted? Thane: Yes! Xerxes: May I suggest knitting? It\u2019s very relaxing. Thane: No reason to suggest it. I\u2019m already knitting a night-shirt for your mother. Bjorn: Mother jokes? How low the sophisticated Thane has fallen. (hide spoiler) ] I also liked the Multiple Scorgasms, Elin\u2019s \u201cgang\u201d, Octavia, Chanel, Bellorie and Savanna. A vampire, a fae, a harpy and a siren. I loved the girls and was also very curious about Adrian, the bodyguard. Fav chat: (view spoiler) [ Bellorie: So, get this. A gorgeous were-shifter stumbled into the bar. He was already drunk, and paused to stare at me like he\u2019d never seen anything more beautiful. Because, of course, he hadn\u2019t. Savy: Until I walked in. Octavia: I must have had the day off. Chanel: I\u2019m pretty effing sure I was hanging out with Octavia. Bellorie: Wow. Could you guys be any more narcissistic? Chanel: I\u2019m not narcissistic. I\u2019m perfect. Bellorie: Anyway. He kissed me, only to pull back and mutter an apology. He said he thought I was his wife, cause I look just like her. I kneed him in the balls, and called him a lying, cheating son of a troll. He then said I sounded just like his wife. Octavia: I bet you told him to bring the female with him the next time he visited the club, because she had to be the wittiest, smartest person ever. Bellorie: So you were there? (hide spoiler) ] In Burning Dawn get to see the Lords of the Underworld as well. One thing that really bothered me was the miscommunication between Thane and Elin but it was easy to look over. The book gripped me from page one till the very end and I just cannot tell you how lucky I feel ho have read it. I really loved it and I\u2019m looking forward to reading the next book in the series (pls be about Xerxes and Cario). Highly recommended. **ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review** First posted on: http://sofialovesreading.blogspot.gr/... ...more Oh my god, what happened?

So when I won an uncorrected proof of her newest book I was excited to finally see what everyone else have been raving about. I must say, I can see why so many enjoy her books. If Burning Dawn is an illustration of her other works, then I\u2019ll be definitely looking forward to reading more of Showalter\u2019s books. Although I have read my fair share of paranormal romances I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a big fan. I tend to be picky about them. I\u2019m always on the lookout for something fun or different and I got to say this book was in this category. I couldn\u2019t help but feel that this book didn\u2019t take itself so seriously. Yes there was drama, action, and romance but all was done with a sense of brevity and fun which was reflected in the writing. There was a great flow and pace in which I never felt bored with so many other things to capture your attention. I enjoyed the world Showalter created where the immortals inhabit. It\u2019s so familiar and yet it\u2019s surrounded by an otherworldly aura that makes it special. A majority of the story\u2019s frivolity comes from this aspect. These immortal creatures of all types are placed in settings that are mundane and familiar to humans. It provides a platform for their individual personalities to stand out. Thane is one of those personalities whom it was joy for me to read about. He is a beautiful meshing of complicatedness. He is strong yet vulnerable, scary but kind, violent but can be oh so tender and not to mention very sexy. Throughout all this the one thing that I love most about him was his great capacity for love, whether it\u2019s for his best friends Xerxes and Bjorn (I love the bond between these three. Their interactions with each other are very funny.) or for Elin. If you get nothing from him, you can clearly see how much he cares for them and his willingness to do what is necessary to protect and see them happy. Elin was a good counterpart for Thane. She was spirited and caring and stubborn when need be. Her strength comes from her fortitude to survive through such horrific events which includes the loss of her husband and being enslaved. She\u2019s someone that can elicit that sympathetic nature in you when you read about her mistreatment due to her halfling heritage and desire to find a place to fit in. There were times where her dialogue and her pov narrative can be a little hard to swallow because of the childish nature of it, making her sound at times to be a petulant teen. It\u2019s not enough to sway my feelings towards her since I had to remind myself that her wording and statements reflect her young age. The best part of the book was the sizzling, steamy chemistry between Thane and Elin. I loved how Showalter took the time to build the tension between the couple, ramping up the intensity each time these two come together. Even through all the denials from both characters you always got the sense that these two would eventually get together. It was fun and sexy and the scenes were just wonderfully written. The sexual energy just leaped off the pages and you wonder how these two have managed to keep away from each other. For my first Showalter book I was impressed. It met my expectations thoroughly. She provided a world in which I had fun getting immersed in and characters that really endeared themselves to me. Thane was a complete heartbreaker who radiated great sexual charisma. The book was a great blend of sexy romance and suspenseful paranormal action. I would love to read more not only from her Angels of the Dark series but from the Lords of the Underworld series as well. Paranormal romances may not be a genre I look into very often, but if it\u2019s one from Showalter then I will not hesitate to pick it up. *Received Advance Uncorrected Proof from Goodreads First Reads Giveaway ...more 4.5 sexy fly away stars!

I needed a good PR book to whet my appetite after not having any luck the past few months and this worked. I felt the writing and overall tone was a big step up from Gena's recent work. This wasn't perfect and there were a few things that I had problems with but I couldn't put this down and found myself absorbed a good 85% of the story. What I loved: Can you blame me? The sexy time was off the charts. I really felt like I was reading Gena's earlier work with all the sensual play and dirty talk. Delicious! I was all a quiver. I'm a sucker for a man who gives the headboard a serious workout. Yes. Good gravy Thane. *fans self* I was honestly impressed with the love scenes and playful sexy banter between Thane and Elin. Nothing was held back and it played in line to who Thane is with all his varying sexual appetites. This was something I was worried would be toned down or missing but thankfully it wasn't. I also appreciated the fact that Gena didn't have Thane going mine mine mine! 20 pages in. The push and pull, both of them trying really hard to fight off the attraction between them and deny it was very refreshing and much more realistic, especially for Thane. Thane was another surprise for me. He never really impressed me before this, I found him too cliche with the playboy attitude, dark tortured past and gorgeous fallen angel looks. But good gravy, this guy is sex on a fucking stick. He compelled me, seduced me and lured me in with his presence, dominating attitude and those gorgeous wings. He's a wonderful package of domineering and arrogant yet tender and super protective and so playful. Take me baby and call me kulta , love him! And I was a little obsessed with his wings. So sexy and pushed all the right buttons for me. What I love is Gena's attention to detail to her world building, every nuance to how these Sent Ones move and work with their wings is wonderfully captured and very accurate & realistic. I could picture everything so clearly. From using it to protect others, to flirt, to show dominance or excitement with just a ruffle of their wings I found very enthralling and so damn adorable and sexy. Another thing that I found addicting was Thane's PAs. Not a big fan of those myself but good lord he carries it so well- those barbells drove me insane. As for Elin, I liked her. She's sweet, fun, compassionate and pretty innocent in contrast to Thane's world. What did bug me however was her sometimes quick knee jerk reactions to certain things. I found it dramatic and tiring near the end. Which comes to my only hold up and part of the reason I straddled between a 4-5 star rating. What didn't work for me was the super sappy dialogue and the silly contrived tension in the second half of the book. Gena loves her girl power ass kicking heroines and that's fine. I just think she tends to get carried away with the 'crazmazing' gab talk and the gushy lovey dovey talk. In fact it's more prominent now more than before. I don't remember the dialogue being like this in the beginning of her LOTU series. The females come off more like High school cliques rather than thousand year old immortals and adults. Ok technically Elin is 21, pretty young but still....the cutesy talk got a little too heavy handed in the end. And the constant misunderstandings and the flip flopping Elin does in the second half was the most frustrating thing of all and made my head hurt. Way too much. This girl was one confused emotional mess after the couple's first big fight. Her 0 to 100 reactions to every single misunderstanding I found a bit bratty and schoolyard worthy. Dissecting every little thing a guy does or doesn't do can only go so far. And stomping around huffing and puffing and throwing attitude around suited for a 15 year old isn't very cute and just asking for a slap. This to me is my biggest complaint with Gena's writing, other than that I love her characters and world building and her sexy alpha heroes. When it was all said and done the world building and overall storyline bumped up the rating. Thankfully none of the 'we must bond & be married before having sex' happened here. (Yes I noticed that Elin didn't sleep with her fiance until after they got married, caught you there Gena). But still it gives me hope that she isn't attached to this new formula and is willing to change things up again. Looking forward to seeing who gets a story next! Xerxes, Bjorn or Axel? *And shout out to Window Seat on a Rainy Day book blog for my ARC copy of this.

The angst wasn't that...angsty, if that makes sense. At least, not to me. Plus, I admit Thane and Elin weren't able to capture my heart and hold it with their story. Thane is a sexy bastard and Elin is a nice girl, but they just can't reach the pure awesomeness that are Xerxes, Bjorn, Aeron, William, Maleah, Olivia and Gilly, my favourite Showalter characters so far. Don't get me wrong, Thane is an interesting guy. Like I said, he's very attractive and hot and I would totally do him if I was enthralled by him as Elin was, but he's just not important to me when compared to the guys I mentioned above. And Elin, she's a sweet woman, really. Too sweet. There were times I thought she felt too much like a little girl, due to the things she said and how she acted. I mean, Gilly herself is supposed to be only 17, but she feels much older. The things she went through shaped her into the mature young woman she is. But Elin? She went through awful things as well, but when we're inside her mind, it feels like we're looking into the mind of a 12-year-old or something. She was frequently thinking things in the line of 'Yes. No. I don't know. Bad, bad, Elin.' See? It looks exactly like a little girl. Or a dog, which is kind of funny now that I'm thinking about it. Anyway, it was a great story just the same, the characters just didn't catch my attention as others did. I'm dying to read Bjorn's book, which I'm guessing it's going to be the next in the series, since he can't go on much longer going through that situation with the demon queen bitch. And Xerxes's. What the heck means he has to remember? Oh boy, and Maleah totally has to be Bjorn's woman, then, since I think that Cario is going to be Xerxes's. O.M.G!

Authors don't have to release a book every 3 months (or even less). It's impossible to maintain the mojo and the language just degenerates, the plot lines that were great becomes AWFUL, which a pity. It ruins the authors for their fans. :-( I was a bit disappointed with the last two works of Ms. Showalter, but this one did it for me. No more. ...more I am not sure what to think about this. The preaching and morality that has been in the last few Gena Showalter books was absent, so that was a plus. And the sex was back. But I didn't care for either Thane or Elin. I don't know why, but I couldn't connect with either of them and so I basically didn't care whether they got thier shit together. There was also a lot more snark/sassy humour in this book, that I don't remember from the others, and for me, it didn't work. I think if the three Angels I am not sure what to think about this.

I think if the three Angels of the Dark books were read back to back, it would create a WTH reaction, since they each seem to have completely different \"feel\", and the only thing connecting them is the world (which isn't all that well developed, to be honest) and the names of characters. ...more I have to say... it seems that this series is trending down as far as my enjoyment of it. I liked the first book fairly well - it was a fun little romp. The second was okay. But this third one... I don't know, I had a hard time getting into it. The female lead was just so... dumb and ditzy, enough that I couldn't figure out for the life of me why Thane was into her. And, too, there were so, so many parts that were downright corny. I cringed too many times to count. It made it hard to enjoy. Eh, I have to say... it seems that this series is trending down as far as my enjoyment of it.

I really enjoyed this book. The old Gena is back...thank you! I'm so happy that she realized that she can love her God and her book's characters can still have crazy, dirty, hot, sex. I do have to admit that quite a few times throughout the book, I was sure I was reading the writings of Kresley Cole instead of Gena Showalter...but I'm not going to start any conspiracy theories here...I'm just saying...eerily similar writing style... But whatevs...the book was so much better than the last Angels of the Dark book...let's hope that Gena will continue to write the way her followers have expected her to and that the next LOTU book is even better. ...more I tried to like Thane, I really did but could not bring myself to like him. I did not care how pretty he is or that he has dimples. He is a Barbaric Man-Whore as well as being a Hypocrite, ex. having people thrown off of the roof and having hands removed, But its ok for him to pick up a Blond whenever the mood strikes him.. Really? Elin was ok as the main female character but the overall story and the emotions felt lop-sided or rather one-sided. Sorry didn't like this book as much as I wanted to.

Elin is a part of Kendras camp as a slave herself, and frees Thane thinking he will rescue her in the process. This book is basically about Thane wanting revenge on the Phoenix and soothing his past demons, and Elin finding her strength and love through Thane. Let's start with Elin: Elin starts off as a weakling. She vomits when sighting blood, screams when anyone tries to harm her, and as someone said in the book \"You're the type of girl that guys want to save\". What I love about Gena's writing is Elin's character - along with others - change through out the book. She's not the same as she was from page one and that is admirable. One thing that caught me off guard is her \"swearing\". I put that in quotes because it's not\u2026 she substitutes it weirdly. Example: when people are harassing her at the bar, she was about to say \"Shut your big, fat mouth hole\". BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!! At first I was like \"did she just say MOUTH HOLE?\", then I got annoyed because she sounded like she was in the 6th grade, then I found humor in it. She's adorable in an annoying way when she tries to swear. Thankfully Elin tones that down after a while and doesn't say anything else like \"sweet juicy sparkles!\" (again, like wtf?) She's a likable character and a great candidate for Thane's heart. Now onto Thane: OHHHHH THANE COME TO MAMA!! He wants revenge on the Phoenix because they enslaved him, and while doing so tries to gain Elin's affections. I have to say that Thane is one of the most dynamic characters in any of Gena's books. He's unpredictable in a good way, and his personality is admirable\u2026 he fights for the people he loves and will do anything to keep them safe. Not only does he have a relationship with Elin, he also has one with his best friends Bjorn and Xerxes. They were tortured in hell together and in the end became very close. They would die for each other and sacrifice their own happiness so the other person can have a good life. This type of relationship warmed my heart and it was a nice touch to show his empathy and strength. Thane is not only extremely good looking, he also has a personality that shines. The writing: In the recent past Gena has strayed away from the sex scenes leaving fans pretty devastated. GENA IS BACK PEEPS!! The sex in this book is amazing! She is the queen of making me feel hot and bothered. I'm so glad and happy to share that piece of news. Gena also goes out of her boundaries and writes sex scenes that aren't in any other book. No, there isn't S&M in this book (Thane loved it in the past) so if you're looking for that it won't be there. Burning Dawn is one of few romance books where the character says what they like about the other person that's NOT looks. Thane and Elin talk about personalities as well. Their characteristics go deeper then how they look on the outside and it was mind blowing! I loved hearing what Thane loved about Elin's personality. It made both of them relatable to me, and that's something romance books are lacking. Props to Gena! One thing that was a little distracting from the plot was all the misunderstandings. Thane would say something and Elin would take offense then leave. Elin would then say something that Thane would see as offensive then leave. This happens way too many times in one book. Their communication skills are off and it affects their relationship. Thankfully, as I said before, both characters grow through out the book so they become adults and hash things out without taking offense and not talking to each other for days. I give this book 4/5 stars. This is a MUST READ if you're a fan of her books. Gena\u2026 I love you.
