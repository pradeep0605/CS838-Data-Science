Loosely based on Paradise Lost, the author has changed it from taking place in paradise to setting it in utopia, and just like how Milton made the devil the most interesting, sympathetic character, here, the character of Joseph Moore is this fantastical, absurd, hilarious, sad, demeaned, rich protagonist who knowingly follows Satan\u2019s quest to force sin into the world. He uses Paradise Lost as if it\u2019s a how-to book! Joseph wants sin because he\u2019s trying to kill himself and it won\u2019t work. In the perfect world, which has been achieved by humorous means, not only can you not die, but since humanity has achieved perfection, heaven has closed. This leaves all the souls caught within the phases of achieving utopia wandering around in purgatory (kind of like how in Christianity, those born before Christ are supposedly in limbo). They\u2019ve gotten very angry about it, and when Joseph leaps off a bridge and his guardian angel appears, she (no name is given) has no incentive to \u2018guard\u2019 him. Rather, it would be better for her if Joseph made the \u2018real\u2019 world less perfect, because then, perhaps, she can leave purgatory. Initially, she tries to seduce him, but he\u2019s become so deflated, so defeated, he can\u2019t do it (he\u2019s in an unhappy marriage). Most of this isn\u2019t explained, you have to infer it from the prose. Joseph though likes her, especially her aggressiveness, and then, he thinks he loves her, so to \u2018free\u2019 his guardian angel, he embarks on a quest to cause sin in utopia. Probably the funniest, most clever parts of this book are about how we achieved perfection. There is only one government and it is run by business. There is no religion and races have been bred out of the population so everyone looks the same. All the reasons for war and conflict have been removed. A sort of eugenically determined caste system has been put in place based on popularity \u2013 A-list, B-list, C-list. Everyone is promised 15 minutes of fame, but A-list citizens are famous, powerful people who run the government/business. There is a mandatory drug regimen for everyone to achieve \u2018tranquility\u2019 (when Joseph goes off his meds, he dips so deeply into Paradise Lost, he can\u2019t tell reality from his fantasy). But, there are ripples in the repressive, controlling perfect world. The writers of children\u2019s fiction have formed an underground resistance and insert into their books suggestions for undermining the system. There are actual children\u2019s books in the novel that are totally believable. They also deliver speeches and at times, do weird things that are supposed suggest protest but really come off as just odd whims. Every member is a character in a famous work of children\u2019s literature, so you have the Big Bad Wolf, Captain Hook, etc. which is what they go by (and which can sometimes confuse things). The rebellion is led by Arthur Dodger (the Big Bad Wolf), who is sort of dating Elisa Green. She\u2019s presented as an uber-perfect fox (I pictured Angelina Jolie) with very dark, S&M fetishes (the \u2018erotic\u2019 parts are very graphic). There is also a government agent, Captain Vincent Belacque (sp?) who works for the part of the government who maintains order. He\u2019s psychic and has become a voyeur because his job is pretty much keeping all these women under surveillance. The women he\u2019s investigating are all people who haven\u2019t done anything serious, but who the government believes are questionable since they refused a marriage proposal or haven\u2019t had a child in a certain amount of time or something like that. If the captain deems them inappropriate or not fitting in, they are \u2018rebranded\u2019, an eerie practice based on the idea that every person is a brand and must use their brand to get ahead in life (since everything is about business). Most people sell their names to companies for advertising and the government has a program in which you treat yourself like a product on the market \u2013 it\u2019s very well done. So, if a woman is \u2018rebranded\u2019 she\u2019s picked up and sent away, which makes it a very scary threat most women live with. The captain is investigating Elisa because her family is an A-list, her brother is very famous (really funny biography), and she\u2019s a bit of a rogue. But, because he\u2019s been watching her, he has become obsessed with her. He won\u2019t arrest her, and he knows about her involvement in the resistance. Meanwhile, Arthur Dodger has figured out that Elisa is under surveillance, so he sends her to seduce the captain to try to figure out what the government knows (this is the part that\u2019s part thriller, part Robert Ludlum). What ensues is double-agents, a romance (again very graphic sex), and everyone trying to out-maneuver each other. The captain knows Elisa has been sent to trick him, but he wants to convert her. Joseph meets a writer, who recruits him for the resistance. At a meeting, he is \u2018inducted\u2019 by Elisa (she\u2019s used as sort of a tool by Arthur), and she actually falls for him. So, she\u2019s with Arthur, faking it with the captain, and now, interested in Joseph. He disappears on his quest \u2013 he\u2019s trying to find an Adam and Eve to foil \u2013 who are apparent from the very beginning. Elisa\u2019s good family is led by Graham Greene, who is an uber-jockish type. I can\u2019t say more without spoiling it, but the prose is dense and bewildering at times. This is a book you have to study. There\u2019s no reading any part quickly, and it is very experimental, from invented words to words I\u2019ve never seen used before, to layer upon layer of action, plot twists, undetailed dialogue and metafiction. It\u2019s easy to get wrapped up in it and there are several sections that are very poetic. It\u2019s one of the finest books I\u2019ve read in a long time, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Calvino, Pynchon, Gaddis, Lowry, Beckett, Joyce and those heavy weights. ...more I was one of the lucky ones who won this book via Goodread's First Read giveaway. It took me a while to get into the book, at the time I won it I was in the middle of re-reading a long series. However, once I picked it up I had a hard time putting it down. It is a wonderful melding of genres that doesn't dissapoint. I am sure my attempt to review will fall short of what is needed to truly understand how new and fresh and interesting this book is. A Science Fiction and Mythology mix presented with a satiric humor that is hilarious, sometimes profane, and always utterly entertaining.<---F> Great book,like kurt vonnegut on steroids</---F>. To say I haven\u2019t read many books of this type would be an understatement. There\u2019s a lot of humor, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m one of those readers who can be in on all of it. I could generally tell what was happening, but all the words piled on can be very confusing. Its dense and sometimes I found myself feeling very lost (I was going to try a plot summary, but I\u2019m not sure I could). Also, there are a lot of made-up words, which adds to the confusion.

Then, there are parts where I knew exactly what was happening and I got really, really into the story \u2013 it\u2019s very well done. And, lots of scenes that made me laugh out loud, which also made it fun to read. Elisa, the main female character, is my hero! I want to be her. Literally, as I was reading it, I wanted to be her. She\u2019s very intelligent and she\u2019s adventurous. She\u2019s probably the sexiest character I\u2019ve ever read. She gets with nearly every guy in the book and she doesn\u2019t play around. Her outfits are detailed and sound stylish or sexy or really over the top. The sex scenes are, to put it some way, seriously hot. They are easily some of the best I\u2019ve read. There are only a few books where, as a reader, you get turned on while your reading them in a way that inspires you. It took me two weeks of sustained reading to read this book (which I could never remember the name of, so any time someone asked me what I was reading I had to make up a title), and I\u2019m very glad I did. Maybe just a little less \u2018literary\u2019 or \u2018experimental\u2019 and I would give it 5 stars. ...more I've finally finished this big book and I have to say it was really worth it - what a funny, charming book.

But, it is in investment - it took me a couple of months to finish it. The characters are well laid out - you care about them - and they have quirks and issues. Joseph Moore is a tired, sad star who finally erupts and takes off. He becomes a weird adventurer with hilarious episodes. Elisa Greene is a lonely, S&M addicted rich girl who pretty much sleeps with everyone in the book. She gets cuaght between the system and a hope for change. The sex scenes with her are well done - really well done ;) These two people live amidst a utopian world, but they are like the only two people who see its flaws. Both of them try to find ways of changing it - Josephy by trying to defeat Elisa's brother - the perfect man, and Elisa by leading a rebellion (made up of children's books writers). On their tails is a pyschic special agent trying to manipulate them, while Elisa tries to manipulate him. If you are looking for an enthralling book with creative language, humor and sex, this is it. I very much enjoyed this book adn have recommended to others. ...more I poured through this book in two days and missed most of the crazy nuisances, but loved it still. I'm going to reread it cuase theres so much too it. The characters are crazy. The setting is crazy!
