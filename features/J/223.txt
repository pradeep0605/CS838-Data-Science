I know the answer to the last question: because sometimes these things surprise you and you end up with a Room , which you think sounds dumb and potentially boring and then ends up amazing . I do wish, however, that books like this particular one got segregated onto their own shelves (<---B>and got their own Dewey decimal numbers</---B>) under the officially recognized genre of \u201cbooks that are pretentious and boring but which critics will adore and which do nothing so much as invoke a bunch of sophisticates standing around at a wine and cheese party over-enunciating words and mocking those who do not understand the finer points of grammar and laughing at their own wit.\u201d And then if they were shelved in their own section I could avoid them like the plague. Because right now they\u2019re harder to detect. Don't even ask me what this one was about. I think I went onto auto-pilot while reading this book, which means pages turned but inside my head I was thinking about more interesting things, like what color I was going to paint my room this year. I think there was a little girl. And some hinted-at secret that should've been intriguing but was not. And there was a rabbit name God, which I kind of remember but mostly know because of the title. ...more I hated this in 2013 and i hated it in 2016.

But I'm afraid I cannot say I enjoyed the book as much, let alone reread it. To me it's like a big jigsaw puzzle and the author tried to put the pieces back together, but sadly some pieces were not put in the right spots or missing, even. I found chapters, paragraphs and lines that were unnecessary and just adding a bit more to the confusion that was already there. She crammed in a lot of big events into such short chapters, resulting in some left unexplored. There were times when I had to reread a paragraph or two (and sometimes even pages) just to really find out what she was trying to say - that's how vague it is - or which character(s) had appeared or been mentioned because she would just refer to them as She or He or We (leading you to an endless guessing game!), and the mystery would be solved paragraphs or pages later (there's actually an event in the book, where she and two others picked up a girl who was running away, and I still don't know who the other two were!). The first 10% of the book was enough to make me want to read more of it, but after I got past that I had to struggle to finish the rest. I'm so glad I've done reading it. That says all, doesn't it? ...more Guilty again :) This book \"bought\" me with just few sentences and I had to buy the rights and be its editor... :) I had that \"something special\" feeling I had buying the rights for THE CURIOUS INCIDENT... Unfortunately due to Serbian publisher the book hasn't reached all the readers it should reach... But it's never late! MUST READ! MUST READ! Hurry up!

Told through the narrative voice of main character, Elly - from infancy through to adulthood - Winman reminds us that life's journey isn't always as smooth as envisaged. The author draws inspiration from her English childhood, which awakened my own fond memories of that particular era: Fish finger suppers, '70s family game shows and a wonderfully calamitous school nativity all brought a grin to my face, causing me to nod in appreciative remembrance. This portrayal of once-innocent childhoods is referenced in the writer's personal notes. She remarks: 'Back then childhood independence was given, not stolen' So true! The first half of the story is bejeweled with love, in all of its guises. I was instantly beguiled by Winman's wonderful writing style, and began to tell friends about this must-read novel before I was even one-third of the way through! The prose is natural, spirited and memorably poignant: there is a poetry to her writing: 'My mother lay down with me on my bed, her perfume tumbling over my face like breath, her words smelling of Dubonnet and lemonade' Now what's not to like about that? Sumptuous stuff! This book is as reassuring as that oversized woollen jumper you reserve only for bouts of influenza. This isn't to say that the narrative is saccharine-sweet; far from it. Uneasy relationships and acts of senseless violence (some globally iconic) form a sombre backdrop. Amidst all the angst and the pathos, though, there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments, which made me sense that the author must be great company on a night out on the town. Best character for me was Elly's fabulously bohemian aunt Nancy, a rambunctious delight who travels the world snogging any similarly-fabulous females who might take her fancy. And so the story rattles along nicely... *But* (Sharp intake of breath). The book kind-of loses its breezy mojo around the halfway point, when the grind of imperishable relationships and the promise of resurrection becomes its focus. I felt that the eponymous God/rabbit premise might have been developed further, and I would have loved for Elly to shed her circumspection for just some of Nancy's devil-may-care personality traits. That being said, the story overall is beautifully told and is a gorgeous read. My sudden admiration for Sarah Winman has already led me to purchase her latest novel 'A Year of Marvellous Ways.' Oh, and I LOVED the authorial add-ones at the back of the book - an idea that I intend to steal! ...more I have just started this book and am absolutely loving it. It is a hilarious book, with Ellie being just too sharp and dry with her little asides. I honestly love a book that sucks me in - especially after that nonsense Fifty shades of Grey rubbish.

There are some conversations in there that I have marked, as I think they speak such truth. One in particular about the last paragraph of page 141, which continues onto page 142. It reminds me of \"The Velveteen Rabbit\", where those deeper life mysteries are discussed within conversation between close friends. I love Sarah Winman's writing. The way she just puts in these unexpected hilarious little statements kept me laughing out loud. I wear reading glasses, and they kept fogging up at times. It made my mascara run, leaving my husband worried that I was upset about something!!!! The bonus material at the end was great to read as well. Being a teacher myself, I think that the way in which she describes her writing process, her encouragement to others to write, and her love of writing were fantastic. This is one book that must be read. ...more Part One the story of Elly as a little girl is magical, heart breaking, sweet, sad, funny, and in a few words: literary perfection Part Two I feel like, had this part of the novel been removed completely, this book would have been perfect. I think the most fascinating part about stories is not knowing the TRUE ending. About being left at one part of someone's life and imagining just what happened afterwards.

I think the most fascinating part about stories is not knowing the TRUE ending. About being left at one part of someone's life and imagining just what happened afterwards. By showing Elly as an adult, the mystery was lost and expectations were not met. The wonder and insecurity and confusion of childhood Elly is missing and because of this, part two just doesn't have the same impact. Regardless, the sheer perfection of part one makes up for any flaws of part two, and I would still happily recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a story about family, love, faith, and wonder. ...more An amazing book - if it doesn't win a prize I'll be VERY surprised! Even though Elly is older than me, much of her childhood resonates with familiarity - watching the Generation Game and shouting out the prizes in excitement, the magic of polaroid cameras, chocolate teacakes and doing the pools!

Elly shares not just a deep and binding bond with her brother Joe, but also a sensitivity and awareness of the world that seems to separate them from the world of their peers. They are, in everything, a team. The voice of Elly is so pure and magical, extremely evocative - I read the book on the brink of tears for the most part, simply because I could see everything do clearly, I felt I was an onlooker in her life. The love of the family permeates the story, they might not be conventional in the usual way - this becomes more apparant as the story goes on - but they are a very close unit. At times both Joe and Elly try to escape but they are always drawn back to the warmth and eccentricity of the family unit. There are some laugh out loud moments and some that make you tear up, it's a tale that rings of truth throughout, heartbreaking, poignant, hilarious, cruel, it's quite simply beautiful. After dissecting this for my book group I have to amend what I have written! Although I did enjoy the book and found it easy to read and involve myself in, the discussion I have since had has made me think more about it. I still stand by the above but would like to add that actually the story is pretty implausible - everything that could possibly happen to this family does, the author seems to have taken every plot under the sun and crammed them into this one novel,so whilst it does make for an exciting read, when you do step back and think, it does make it a less realistic. Also the 70's reminiscence is too modern in feeling. I don't remember much of the 70's but my fellow group members do and their feeling was that the things discussed so openly in the book would not have been in the 70's as everything was much more pushed under the carpet, politely ignored - the way that domestic abuse, homosexuality, child abuse is discussed in the book is much more post 90's than 70's. Again, some story lines are started but not adequately finished or even explained and as for God being a rabbit, the premise started off well but seemed to peter into nothng. Then, with reflection, Elly is annoying! She starts by being such a great little girl and develops into a big wet who can't hold anything down and is obsessed with a childhood friend she hasn't seen in years and her equally self-obsessed brother, but why this happens is only implied and supposed rather than told as fact. I think if more had been adequately explained instead of threads been given and then left hanging it would have been much more satisfying and if we had had a couple of major themes in the book rather than 101 we might have had more loose ends tied up. Yes, with hindsight it is rather fantastical, but if you like drama and high maintenance characters who have everything happen to them and it all turns out really well, then read it, you won't be disappointed - just don't expect much in the way of reality! ...more Sorry.

Having read this for my local bookclub meeting this evening I am not quite sure what I would want to say. It seems to me that Sarah Winman is not quite sure what she is writing. Is it the story of family relationship both 'nuclear ' and extended, is it a treatise on gay relationships, is it an account of a brother and sister growing to adulthood across the latter part of the 20th Century and of course all of these can be totally harmoniously co-joined and indeed they are but the story comes off its rails because of the bizarre and unreasonable loading up of accidents of chance and fantasy as it goes on. When two of the characters,one of whom is besotted with the other, having been apart for years and having had no contact whatsoever, suddenly meet up at a party on another continent from the one in which they had originally met I immediately thought ' of all the parties in all the world you had to walk into one of mine'. I do appreciate that chance and co-incidence often plays an important part in love and romance but this grated as unbelievable. When the father, having all the time been banking on winning a large prize, does just that I thought unbelievable. When another character supposedly knew the time and manner of his death, a falling coconut,and at one point the very act happened but served not to kill him but to restore his sight I thought unbelievable. I could go on but though there is a good deal of really funny dialogue and some witty descriptions I found the overall affect dubious. Winman addresses beautifully the questions of love, fidelity, expectation and the ability of friendship whether sexually expressed or platonic to enhance and transform but i do wish she had written in a way that did not rely upon, in my opinion, a regular need to massively suspend if not belief then the over the top coincidence quotient. This story could have been written without them and in that way the story would not have been so much of an obvious novel. I found the characters endearing, maddening, stupid and amusing but they always remained obvious characters in a story. I never felt moved to believe in their independant existence which is bizarre since they were theoretically growing up as I was and their journey should have been mine ...more I can imagine that as a writer it is tempting to do too much in one's first novel and I think this is what's wrong with this particular debut.

It annoys me greatly when an author glosses over the realities of life by making characters incredibly rich. I saw no need for the sudden, imprecise wealth that befell this family before their relocation to Cornwall. It seemed to serve only to answer potential questions and explain how it was no one really worked for the rest of the book. Still the book and characters seemed comfortable in England and there the story made sense. When Joe oddly appeared in New York as a banker, I grew worried. First a Princess Di mention and now this a Sept 11 foreshadowing. And it was well written and definitely evoked emotion (although that's relatively easy with this subject); but was it necessary? If anything it distracted from the heart of the story and relied on the reader's existing emotional connection to the event to tug at the heart strings. I read this book in a couple days on holiday and it suited that purpose well. I didn't dislike it, I was simply disappointed that no one encouraged the author to strip out the global events and concentrate on developing the characters she so lovingly introduced early in the book. There was enough there already. ...more Coming-of-age novels come with an absolution: They don\u2019t actually have to be about-about anything. They can just be.

A series of events, linked or otherwise, that start quirky and end artfully or in some combination of that. Sarah Winman\u2019s debut novel \u201cWhen God was a Rabbit\u201d takes advantage of this convention. Technically it\u2019s about a brother and sister; that sister and her best friend; that brother and his best friend with benefits. It has no plot line that looms, waiting to be solved, fixed, redeemed or rectified, instead it has episodes that must be handled before the next episode or just later. The story centers on Elly, a sassafrass little missy who auditions for the Christmas pageant with a monologue that references booze and abortions, lands the role of an innkeeper, then spontaneously changes the Christmas story mid-performance by assuring Mary and Joseph that there is plenty of room at the Inn, not to mention a view. She also has some thoughts on the illegitimate child. When a life-changing incident occurs, and Elly mentions it to her older brother Joe in an off-handed way, he handles it the best he can and then gives her a gift, a rabbit that she names God. God talks to her, not in the obnoxious way of, say, TV\u2019s Wilfred. Just a sentence or two that provides direction either from his mouth or her imagination. Elly becomes best friends with Jenny Penny, a schoolmate with wild hair and a wilder mother. Jenny Penny is a little bit of a seer, as tamed and subtle in her art as the talking rabbit. Jenny Penny finds stability at Elly\u2019s home and the two develop a thick bond that is severed when Elly\u2019s father wins the lottery and moves the family far away to the country, to a house that looks like it belongs to rich people and will eventually double as a B&B. Elly keeps in phone contact, but eventually loses touch with her friend when Jenny Penny\u2019s mom makes a bum relationship decision that has them scrambling for new identities and no forwarding address. Meanwhile, Joe goes off to school and later to New York and Elly is left to wander in the woods, delve further and further into herself and just get weird. There is a cast of characters who are taken in by the family: An elderly man with a host of wild stories from his past and a woman who croons showtunes and is most comfortable with a feather boa. In the second half of the book, lost characters return and characters become lost. Winman is a super skilled in the art of subtlety. A lot of the biggest reveals in the book are unraveled either without words or backward. Young Elly doesn\u2019t tell Joe that she was molested by the next-door neighbor, rather she explains that she knows the difference between circumcised and not and her brother fills in the blanks. Two characters are missing, one calls, it takes half a page to figure out who is on the phone with Elly. And in a fun moment that epitomises her control with language: Winman writes a chaos scene, a party in which Jenny Penny\u2019s mom is out front monitoring traffic and the girls are singing \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d along with a record.

When God was a Rabbit describes itself as the story of a brother and sister, \"about childhood and growing up, friendships and families, triumph and tragedy and everything in between...about love in all its forms\". That is a perfectly fair description as far as it goes. What it doesn't say is anything of the quiet and kindly magic with which Sarah Winman defines her characters. Elly, her brother Joe and her childhood friend Jenny Penny are all outsiders - not the angry and embittered kind, though, but the kind who know they are in some small way different, unique, set apart. They, their family, and the friends who become a part of that extended family may be fictional, but they have the immediacy and honesty and vibrancy of real people, and their lives have the ring of a true story. They are flawed, passionate, muddled, baggage-laden, generous, tragic, vibrant, good, above all human. They are the people we know, the people we are, the people with whom we want to surround ourselves. Elly and her family live through the events of the 1970s, 1990s and the early years of the new millennium - a shared experience for many readers, and one that rings true even at those points where are own memories are different. Winman has the particular gift for being able to spring a momentous event on the reader, whether historical or fictional, with all the unexpected impact of real life. And then there is the language. Winman has the eye for observation of a small child and the pen of a poet, but combines them with the technical skill and self-control to reserve her poetic imagery for the moments that really matter, big and small. The result is that we are never inured to her description, we never lose the sense of wonder or the ability to see the extraordinary nature of the ordinary. Read this book late at night, when the house is quiet and your defences are down. Let it work its magic. Drink in its imagery and its goodness and its sadness and its hope like a drowning man inhales the ocean. Let it into your DNA; let it enlarge and enrich your emotional vocabulary. Let it tell you that you are not alone. ...more Firstly, this is a fiction book of two halves. First half I was loving the book and would have given it five stars.

First half I was loving the book and would have given it five stars. Second half \u2013 I loved it less so three stars. Rather than go for the average I\u2019ll keep the overall review at three stars. Good book, unusual but messy \u2013 I will explain further. The fictional character of Elly is a real British girl. Born in 1968, she charts her life around popular culture and world events as she becomes self-aware and of what it means to be British, female and part of a loving family. As the book progresses into second half territory, Elly\u2019s life becomes ultimately more complex. Life as an adult loses its sheen as reality bites and she becomes aware of the fact that adults can \u2018crack\u2019 under various guises and that nothing good is everlasting. In an un-chick-lit way, the author Winman paints characters that seem to live whimsical lives lived between fact and fable. In many ways, Winman\u2019s Cornish landscape becomes a fantasy idyllic \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 where time has no meaning. When the chaotic disasters of modern culture and modern tragedies like 9/11 are pipped against a family setting of a sleepy British backdrop then it\u2019s no wonder that Winman\u2019s characters become confused with the expectations of their own mental world. Quite literally \u2013 like Elly\u2019s brother \u2013 they crack up and subsequent themes of nothingness are perpetuated in a spiralling mythical way. Hard for any reviewer to describe quite frankly. Bonkers in a nutshell. It with this then that I personally feel that Winman has gone too far with her work. At first, I found her characters, lovely, warm quaint and feasibly British with all their little quirks of decades gone by. In hyper adulthood, Winman stretches her characterisation like it\u2019s on elastic and the themes, storylines and people are stretched far too much, in my humble opinion, to be believed and recognisable. It\u2019s when a character ceases to be believable that a book loses cachet for me and I felt cheated on the fact that good characters were going to rot somewhere during the mid-second half. I love a book that pushes the boundaries and dares to be different but this book loses its ethic for me. I like good fiction but this is crazy-mad and a bit pithy, silly and desperate by the end. 10 out of 10 for ambition but unfortunately 10 out of 10 for reader frustration.

I havent read anything in a long time which has made me smile as much as this book, and draw on every other emotion I possess to supplement this. This story begins in the past, looking at the early lives of the main protagonists, and it is this section of the novel which sets the tone for the remainder of the story and lures you into the lives of the characters within. It is this section of the story which really reminds me of 'A Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night-time' with the characters innocence really dominating and drawing you into their lives and world, making it difficult to put this book down. As the novel progresses and the characters age it is difficult to cast this earlier innocence aside and it is this which draws you through the rest of the story. It was this section of the novel where my emotions really kicked in and I found myself sobbing and laughing all at the same time. The trial and tribulations of the characters really intensify in the second part of the novel, and there are moments of real tension and anxiety where your heart really goes out to the lead characters. Winmans earlier skill in creating her characters means that you are really engrossed in this section of the novel and go on the journey with the charcters. I would recommend this novel to anyone, young or old, male or female as I think there really is something in this for anyone. I do think this gives 'A Curious Incident..' a run for its money in terms of creating a young lead character who can draw you into their world and draw every single emotion possible out of you. A really fab read which I will certainly read again again. ...more Divna, duhovita i delom tu\u017ena pri\u010da iz ugla jedne devoj\u010dice o \u017eivotu i odrastanju. WARNING! POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!

POTENTIAL SPOILERS!! For this review I use a lot of quotations from the book and I talk a lot about what happened over the first half of the book. If you consider either of those things to be spoilers then I recommend that you read no further :) \u2018<+++>When God Was a Rabbit</+++>\u2019 is a book about love and friendship. It tells the sibling love story of a brother and sister as they go from childhood to adulthood while also being an interesting dissection of family life as seen through the eyes of the youngest family member. The book is told through the point of view of Elly: initially as a young girl who sees the world with magical eyes and then as a grown woman who has become weary of spirit. The book is split into two halves; quite simply called part one and part two. Part one starts with the birth of Elly in 1968 and continues up until December 1980. From the earliest age Elly is portrayed as highly inquisitive and extremely capable. She seemed to have an almost ethereal or other-worldly feel about her and quite happily made conversation and friendships with adults; one such pivotal \u2018friendship\u2019 was that with her elderly next door neighbour Mr Golan who turned out to be a very mentally disturbed individual. Within the first few chapters we see the inappropriateness of this relationship with the young girl and something happens, a secret is shared, that shapes the rest of both Elly and her brother Joe\u2019s lives. It is at this point in the book we are introduced to the character God from the story\u2019s title. God is a pet rabbit that Elly\u2019s brother gifts to her so that she will have a more appropriate friend and will not be lonely. A recurring theme throughout this book is Elly\u2019s search for a real god or a better understanding of religion. The most focused upon relationship in this book is the one between Elly and her brother Joe. Joe is five years older than Elly and very protective of her. From her earliest age Elly viewed Joe as \u201can exotic creature\u201d. He was a rank outsider who liked to quietly rebel against the conservative world. Joe was struggling with being gay in a time period when it was much more difficult to be so. However in his teenage years Joe takes up rugby and meets Charlie; this becomes a most influential relationship in his life. Suddenly Joe was happy whenever he was playing rugby and soon Elly discovers the real reason is Charlie. Her complete acceptance and love for her brother is absolutely beautiful. The relationship between Joe and Charlie is sensitively written. However, this being a relationship of youth it unfortunately breaks up when Charlie has to move away with his father. This crushes Joe as when Charlie breaks up with him he does it in a very callous manner. Joe runs off but Charlie later explains to Elly that he only said those cruel words because his father was nearby and listening; that Charlie had to be careful. He also wished for Elly to tell Joe \u201csomething nice\u201d but Elly being such a wonderfully loyal sister had had no time for listening to his sad excuses. When they broke up it was a particular heart wrenching part of the story and illustrated beautifully some of the extra difficulties that can be faced by those who are teenage and gay. Elly\u2019s only school friend as a child was a slightly peculiar girl named Jenny Penny. Jenny came from a difficult background and spent a lot of time with Elly\u2019s family while her own mother was out having \u201cfun\u201d with her various stream of boyfriends or uncles as Jenny was made refer to them as. Theirs was an innocent friendship filled with magic and dreams. The two girls stood up for each other and dreamed of running away to the lost city of Atlantis together. Their childhood friendship was filled with some very unpredictable moments and it was one of my favourite aspects of this book. Elly\u2019s mother was a well written, multi-layered character. She had some lovely idiosyncrasies and had almost quirky ideas about motherhood; she often referenced psychology books while rearing her young children which led to some very funny observations by the young Elly. She was a woman who had been once quite happy and carefree but when she lost her parents in a tragic accident (very early in the book) her demeanour changed slightly and she started to view life in a more negative manner. However she was also someone who Elly could always rely on and this led to some quietly profound moments for their mother-daughter relationship within the storyline; most notably during one event when Elly\u2019s mother discovered a lump. \u201cI sat on the bed noting her qualities in a way most people would have reserved for an epitaph. My fear was as silent as her multiplying cells. My mother was beautiful. She had lovely hands that lifted the conversation when she spoke, and had she been deaf her singing would have been as elegant as a poet speaking verse. I looked at her eyes: blue, blue, blue; same as mine. I sang the colour in my head until it swamped my essence like seawater. ... I shuddered and said \"I've got a lump too.\" \"Where\", she asked. And I pointed to my throat and she pulled me to her and held me, and I smelt the lavender that had escaped her shirts.\u201d Elly\u2019s mother was loved both by Elly\u2019s father and Elly\u2019s aunt Nancy. This provided the backdrop for a beautiful dynamic between the two grown up siblings which was lovely to contrast with the relationship between Elly and her brother. Aunt Nancy, Elly\u2019s father\u2019s sister provided some lovely light relief and also imparted some of the wisest thoughts to Elly and Joe both as children and as adults. She was particularly important in Joe\u2019s life as she was able to talk to him about how it felt to be gay. There was an expertly handled character progression regarding Elly\u2019s father. He changed from a man who saw a glass as half full to one who saw it as half empty, and ultimately, after a particularly poignant chapter featuring a client from his work named Jean Hargreaves, to a man who was \"drained of everything\u201d. This event lead to the family moving from their home in suburbia to the countryside giving Joe a new start and leading to Elly feeling the devastating loss of having to leave her childhood friend Jenny Penny behind. \u201cWe would see each other again but only the once - as children anyway - before our lives diverged like rivers separating and carving across new terrain. But I didn't know that as I waved to her from the car and shouted 'see you soon, I'll miss you!' I didn't know that as I shouted 'you're my best friend! Write to me!' I knew none of that as I looked back and watched her and our street recede like the point of light in a tunnel, until the moment we turned the corner and she and it were gone. I felt the air sucked out of my lungs like life itself.\u201d When the family moved to the country we were introduced to a whole new cast of supporting characters. Elly felt very much an outsider and withdrew within herself. She skipped school frequently and met the mercurial Arthur, an older gentleman, who rented a small cottage on her parents\u2019 property. \u201c'But I like learning' I said. 'I just don't like school. I used to but it's different here. I still want to play Arthur but everyone in my class wants to be grown up. I'm different. They tell me I'm different and I know I am, but only with them does it feel wrong'.\u201d Joe still lived in the shadow of his great love but was still protective of Elly and let her tag along with him doing all sorts of activities. The warmth and love of their sibling friendship was really something that jumped out of the pages at me. \u201cWe cooked the fish on a makeshift fire next to the jetty and I said that if we were shipwrecked we'd do okay by ourselves now, and we wouldn't need anyone else. He smiled but his eyes gave away that he'd always need someone else. No amount of self-sufficiency could dispel the craving he still felt for that person we no longer talked about; that person who had taken him apart and left a piece missing that none of us could find.\u201d After the family\u2019s second Christmas in the country events jumped forward fifteen years for part two of the novel and if I am truly honest, I almost wish they hadn\u2019t. Part one was so magical and the language was so lyrical that I just got lost in the pages of Elly\u2019s childhood and seeing the children as adults somewhat tarnished that happy experience for me. As I was so very anxious about reading the second half of the book perhaps my fear did colour how I responded to the second half. When we met Elly again it was 1995 and she was twenty-seven years old, running from job to job, having panic attacks and had not been in a stable and healthy relationship but did not seem to know why. Her brother Joe had moved to, or more aptly run away to New York where he could feel freer and be more comfortably out. He still seemed to be burdened within his soul whether by his lost childhood love or by the secret that Elly had sworn him to keep and seemed to constantly be hiding from something. \u201cYou had to translate his actions, for they were seldom accompanied by words, because his world was a quiet world; a disconnected, fractured space; a puzzle that made him phone me at 3 o'clock in the morning, asking me for the last piece of the border so he could fill in the sky\u201d A sense of knowing who you are and becoming comfortable with yourself was a great theme of this novel. It was interesting to see how their childhoods had created such complex and troubled adult characters but for me part two was not as moving as part one. It lost some of that feeling of magic; that ethereal touch that the author had so lovingly given to part one. And I didn\u2019t love the reintroduction of Jenny Penny\u2019s character as much as I thought I would; her storyline just didn\u2019t ring as true to me as other plots within the novel did. However the plot was carried forward nicely and I sped through this section reading it twice as quickly as the first. The first section felt very languid; reading it reminded me of an afternoon of a hot summer\u2019s day running into a warm night, everything was just so still and calm. Some of the more beautiful chapters in part two dealt with the relationship between Arthur and his life-long best friend Ginger as they both aged and grew more and more infirm. Their chapters in part two were my favourites as some of the more beautiful passage ways were written about them. \u201cI never knew if she had any real appetite or not, for she had not eaten solids for days. But he broke a piece off and held it to her mouth and she ate hungrily; for it was the memory she was tasting again, and the memory tasted good. I moved the chair close to the bed for him and he sat down and held her hand. His own death he had made peace with years ago, but everyone else's still frightened him and so he held her hand to not let her go. He held her hand because he wasn't ready to let her go.\u201d I liked how certain political and cultural events were referenced in the book as helpful reminders of the time period e.g. John Lennon's shooting, the London docklands bombing, Princess Diana's funeral, 9/11 etc. It was also very interesting to see how these world events impacted on one small family. I really enjoyed this book. It had a wonderful other worldly quality to it and it was a heartfelt account of the trials and tribulations of a family. It really demonstrated how a person\u2019s whole world really just revolves around a very small number of people: those who you are related to and your closest of friends. Perhaps as a negative you could say this family experienced one or two too many shocks, tragic events or catastrophic life events\u2026it is like the whole gamut of bad experiences are put into this novel (view spoiler) [ from sexual abuse to hostage taking to amnesia\u2026 (hide spoiler) ] and sometimes it seemed as if these events were only put in place to shock. However, to give the author their due, each was used as a wonderful plot device and I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of life that Elly and her family took within the pages of this book. I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading beautiful, descriptive prose. Four stars Just a word of caution to some readers, there is one sex scene featuring the adult Elly that is quite harsh in its tone and some people may be offended by it. ...more This is one of those ubiquitous books that I ended up reading mainly because I kept seeing it everywhere, and it turned out to be a lot better than I thought it might be, given its obvious popularity. The plot revolves around Elly, who narrates the story, her brother Joe, and their eccentric family and acquaintances - most notably Elly's best friend, the strange and striking Jenny Penny.

The plot revolves around Elly, who narrates the story, her brother Joe, and their eccentric family and acquaintances - most notably Elly's best friend, the strange and striking Jenny Penny. The book is divided into two halves - Elly's childhood, beginning in 1968, and her adulthood, from 1995 onwards - and these sections in turn are split up into lots of short chapters. The prose is fluid and delicately beautiful, and the characters are quirky and whimsical - except much less annoying, and much more likeable, than that makes them sound; they're not always believable, but they're engaging and colourful. The first half of the book is the best; it's quite magical and skilfully captures the wonders of childhood, the nuances of a child's thoughts and feelings, and the peculiar fascination of young friendship. The second half, picking up Elly's story after a gap of about 15 years, I didn't think was as successful, but I still found it both compelling and poignant. There were points when it reminded me of the two Siri Hustvedt books I've read this year - a pretty impressive achievement for a debut novel. There are a few problems, however. Elly often starts a chapter without mentioning who she's talking about for several lines or even paragraphs, and a number of times I had to either re-read (in case I'd missed a name) or skip ahead (to figure out who she meant so I could make sense of it). Lack of detail is a problem at other points in the book, the most obvious example being that Elly is sexually abused by a neighbour as a child, but as it's never directly referred to or talked about (until the very end, and even then we don't find out what actually happened), this is a weirdly indistinct detail and you never get any sense of how it has truly affected her. Perhaps the absence of the event, the unspoken-ness of it, is supposed to be the point, but I found it all much too vague - if your concentration lapsed for a couple of sentences you could easily miss that it had happened at all. I thought this book was gorgeously written, evocative and moving - but I did feel a little disappointed at the end. There's a curious coldness about the characters sometimes, and despite the vivid exploration of Elly's childhood, I didn't feel I knew much about who she was as an adult. There was a lot about how she interacted with Joe, Charlie, Arthur, Nancy et al, but hardly anything about what her own life amounted to apart from writing her column, which was only mentioned in passing anyway, and a one-night stand with a stranger. I couldn't even work out where she was actually supposed to live. I also felt a bit let down that Jenny didn't feature much in the second half, given her powerful presence in the first, and that the elements of magical realism weren't resolved/explained. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this book. It's full of big themes - love (more of the kind found between siblings and friends than the romantic sort, although there's a bit of that too), childhood and growing up, sexuality, mortality and bereavement, as well as the bigger world events going on in the background of all this, with 9/11 being particularly key. The scope of the story is huge, but Winman's light touch makes it very easy to read and it's incredibly beguiling; I found it instantly absorbing and read it very quickly. ...more Elly and Joe are \"two halves of a whole\"; sister and brother.

Both must learn to overcome their losses as well, but Elly knows it\u2019s their relationship and companionship that holds them steady. When God Was a Rabbit is a story of childhood and growing up; friendships and families, the loss of innocence, triumph and tragedy and everything in between. Joe is the one who gives Elly her rabbit, which she calls God (much to her teacher's horror) and Joe is the one who helps her through the difficult things in her life. He keeps her secrets safely tucked away. He is her \"love interest\" in a purely wholesome and normal way. There were some very funny parts to the book, and it started off quite promising. I especially loved the Nativity fiasco in which Elly's friend Jenny is adamant to play the part of an octopus and Elly changes the bible story to enhance her own part in the play; a debarcle which ultimately causes the resignation of a teacher and the death of baby Jesus. This part of the story made me laugh out loud, but maybe that\u2019s more a reflection of my Catholic school experiences rather than excellence in writing. Even so, I genuinely enjoyed the first few chapters, but, sadly the book doesn\u2019t live up to its early promise. This book was highly recommended to me but though I thought it was ok, I can\u2019t say that I enjoyed it as much as I was expecting; I loved the title, I loved the concept, but the book was in the end quite disappointing. It was as if Sarah Winman was trying to put too many concepts all in one book (9/11, the death of Princess Di, Homosexual, platonic and family love, as well as child abuse, love lost, sexual awakenings, cancer, death and post traumatic amnesia) Every theme was a big one and each deserved more exploration; it all seemed a little too clumsy and, as a result, nothing was explored in enough depth. I would say this book is diverting and probably worth a read if you don\u2019t want anything too taxing. A good beach read, and worth a look, but just not my thing maybe. ...more F Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote \"character is plot, plot is character\". Sarah Winman in When God Was a Rabbit, however, has decided to forego both.

It was just meandering along, some questions being lifted into the mind of the reader, only to be abandoned and never picked up on again. To illustrate this point - early on in the book, the main character's brother asks how she knows about Mr Golan's penis. Good question - an interesting question, hinting at some trauma or tragedy which has befallen the heroine during her formative years. Sadly, by page 198, this question STILL had not been answered. It had just been glossed over. By page 198, I decided I didn't care all that much after all. I didn't like the heroine; the characters I did like, i.e. her brother and her supposed BFF, Jenny Penny, weren't formed or featured enough to save my interest, and I did something which I hardly ever do, and gave up reading. I know this book is bad, because generally no matter how dire it is, I'll always try and finish it. Here, in this instance, I failed. It makes my blood boil that books like this one: poorly conceived and executed, written by authors who are not writers at all but just thought \"they'd have a go because how hard can it be\" are picked up by companies like Headline and then shoved down enough people's throats to boost sales sufficiently to force it onto the best seller list. To add insult to injury there was then a section at the back of the book (albeit a short one) where Sarah Winman pontificates about her \"life as a writer\"; and then - even worse - there's a section on \"Reading Group Questions\" as if readers need to be told what to think anyway. This reader does not need 20 words to tell you what she thinks. I can sum it up in one: \"DIRE\". ...more This is a beautiful book.

It would be too cliched to merely call this 'black humour' - Winman has achieved much more than that. I'm left with the feeling that maybe all family histories, no matter how bleak, bland or banal, are worthy of being told - so long as you can just find the right voice. I think of how many books I read each year that deal with grief, triumph over adversity, \"epic sagas\" and so on, and I invariably take much away from them. But I don't always enjoy the process. When God Was a Rabbit offers a story that will resonate long after you forget the details, but it's also an absolute pleasure of an experience. I only have one gripe with this book, and that is that I've bought three copies so far and none has stayed resident on my shelf for longer than a week.

Membaca When God Was a Rabbit seakan-akan saya menonton film Indie, original dan di luar standar pakem drama pada umumnya. Kaget juga saya ketika tahu ini buku adalah buku pertama Sarah Winman. Kalau yang berminat membaca buku yang lain dari yang lain, When God Was a Rabbit patut dicoba, jangan terkecoh dengan judul dan covernya. Buku ini berkisah tentang keluarga, cinta, tragedi, kehilangan. This is a book about a brother and a sister. It's a book about secrets and starting over, friendship and family, triumph and tragedy, and everything in between. More than anything, it's a book about love in all its forms. Indeed. Salut untuk Penerbit Bentang yang jeli menerbitkan buku ini ke bahasa Indonesia di saat yang tepat, sedang hangat-hangatnya nih di bookdepository.com selain buku karangan Georde R. R. Martin - serial Game of Thrones. Masalah terjemahan? Masih perlu diragukan kualitas mbak Rinurbad? :) 4 bintang. ...more I really enjoyed the first part of this book, and thought I was on to a really insightful journey into becoming an adult. But I ended up becoming severely disappointed by the rest of it starting from the point in the story which essentially went \"And then Daddy won the pools so we all moved to a big house in the country, ran a B&B and our lives were fine\". It touched slightly on Eleanor's father's apparent addiction to gambling, which was interesting, but then dropped it and that was that.

It touched slightly on Eleanor's father's apparent addiction to gambling, which was interesting, but then dropped it and that was that. The whole thing from that point on read like a \"this happened, and then this happened\" kind of story you get told by small children, and the strange characters in it which were supposed to be quirky and idiosyncratic weren't nearly developed enough so when bad things happened to them I just didn't care. The part describing 9/11 was interesting, but turned out to have nothing at all to do with Eleanor's brother who happened to work in the World Trade Centre, as he had wandered off, got attacked and couldn't remember anything. This was random to say the least, and the fact that we never find out what happened to him is more than a little dissatisfying. I ended up speed reading to the end and feeling glad to start another book. ...more Recomendadisimo para mentes que buscan un m\u00e1s all\u00e1 en un libro!!

Luego descubr\u00ed que ese t\u00edtulo tan particular se corresponde en realidad con algo bastante sencillo y trivial en la vida de Elly (el nombre de una mascota, efectivamente), y que sin embargo esconde para mi un significado m\u00e1s amplio. Cuando Di \"Cuando Dios era un conejo\" nos relata una historia familiar y de vida desde la perspectiva de Elly, en una primera parte desde el punto de vista de la infancia, y luego ya siendo adulta.

Cuando Dios era un conejo.. Cuando todo era m\u00e1s simple, cuando la inocencia de la infancia estaba lejos a\u00fan de la distorsi\u00f3n de las cosas que impone la adultez. Para mi esta historia trata sobre eso; la transici\u00f3n de la ni\u00f1ez a la vida adulta, la alegr\u00eda y el dolor, la calidez de la vida familiar y tambi\u00e9n su contracara hecha de secretos y silencios. El libro transmite una cotidianeidad que resulta atrapante e invita a seguir leyendo, es una historia que se va construyendo lentamente pero que nos hace part\u00edcipes de cada situaci\u00f3n esencial. Un gran punto a favor para los personajes m\u00e1s entra\u00f1ables, que para m\u00ed fueron Arthur y Ginger. Y tambi\u00e9n para esos toques de realismo m\u00e1gico que condimentan el relato. En resumen, es probable que no sea un libro para todos y que su ritmo pueda parecer lento, pero es ese estilo de historia que, con un estilo pausado, va calando hondo y dejando huella. Recomendado para quienes deseen encontrarse con una buena reflexi\u00f3n sobre la familia, las relaciones, el amor, la vida y la muerte, las decisiones que nos definen y el destino que vamos construyendo. ...more Heart-wrenching, funny and moving. There were moments that made me giggle out loud, and moments that brought me near to tears. I don't how to describe the plot; this is just a story about growing up, about family, relationships and life. I was transported into Elly's world experiencing life through her eyes. The characters are unforgettable, each of them equally memorable in their own ways - Elly, Joe, Jenny Penny, Arthur, Nancy, Ginger and even the mysterious talking rabbit called \"God\".

It seems like such a simple story, but behind that simplicity is so much depth, so much insight about life, love, pain and sorrow. Highly recommended! ...more this book is so awesome.
