As the title sugge Paul Auster's The brooklyn Follies presents a stark contrast to the first work of his that I've read, The New York Trilogy ; although the majority of it takes place in New York, the two are different as night and day. Novels that comprise The New York Trilogy have been largely experimental, post-modern cat and mouse between the author and the reader; <+++>The Brooklyn Follies</+++> is a novel with a pretty straightforward but nevertheless compelling plot and characters one can care about. As the title suggests, it is a novel about folly; what follies do we put ourselves in,<---M> voluntarily or not</---M>, and what are their consequences. The protagonist and narrator is a man named <---C>Nathan Glass</---C>, a 60 year old ex-insurance salesman, who went through lung cancer and has recently became a divorcee, has sort of given up on life and wants to calmly wait it out until its end, spending the savings he has attained. Looking for a quiet place to die, upon someone's recommendation he moves back to Brooklyn, the place he kept returning to, as he lived there as a child. While browsing the area, Nathan Wood encounters his newhew, Tom, once a promising academician, now a former cab driver and a current used book store employee. He introduces Nathan to his boss, Harry Duncan, a character with a colorful past, who still has a few schemes and plans up his sleeve. To pass the time, Nathan began a project of his own - The Book of Human Folly - an accounts of mishaps and mistakes, which as the title suggest might have ended as the text of the very novel we're reading. Starting with a wish to die, The Brooklyn Follies slowly moves up towards the will to live. Reading the novel is a journey, during which we witness the transformation of the characters; their redemption and reconfirmation, regaining of life. The tone is much more jovial than the one of The New York Trilogy and the characters often end up in mishap and folly; but there is poignancy, a sense of place and time, a community before the 9/11 attacks, peacefulness and ordinariness. The plot is captivating and the drama is real; to say more would be to spoil it. The characters are colorful and the book never drags; in fact, I wouldn't mind if it was longer. The theme of the book, the folly, is an important one. We all are a part of life, and observe it. The characters in the novel all have ben lost, resigned or misplaced; we observe how they slowly get their lives back, and change from willing to die to wanting to live. Perhaps beneath the tiredness and mundanity there is still something worth striving for, and these people have taken their chances. Although not the most original of ideas, the novel is captivating and full of colorful characters. The writing is crisp, and the lack of surreal elements and impersonal cold serves greatly to its favor. Auster paints his Brooklyn with warm strokes, and gives his characters original and likable personalities; the novel is a gentle and tender one, where the reader genuinely cares about the fate of people he's reading about.It's humorous, engaging and inspiring; it's human drama done well. A good choice to spend several hours, involved in the life of an everyman, his aspirations, dreams, triumphs, failures and hopes. At worst, you'l put it away and not think much of it; at best, it might inspire you and re-engage you with everyday activities and make you see them in a different light. ...more Oh hey look, another book by a pompous old white man peopled almost entirely by pompous white men holding forth on existence and the meaning of life and the inner workings of the mind and their own bloated legacies and women as playthings and agents of growth.

En mi primera adolescencia le\u00ed la 'Trilog\u00eda de Nueva York' y me impact\u00f3 como pocos libros me hab\u00edan impactado, sobre todo el primero de los tres relatos, 'La ciudad de cristal'. Era un libro complejo, inteligente, ambiguo, y desconcertante, que te hac\u00eda pensar y abierto a diferentes posibles interpretaciones. Todo lo contrario de 'Brooklyn Follies', que es el libro m\u00e1s superficial, simpl\u00f3n y obvio que he le\u00eddo en mucho tiempo. Y ni en el mejor de los sue\u00f1os se puede calificar con el eufemismo de \"entretenido\", porque es tan previsible que produce dolor de cabeza. Promete ser una colecci\u00f3n de an\u00e9cdotas divertidas de personajes variopintos del barrio de Brooklyn, pero no tiene ni an\u00e9cdotas, ni personajes curiosos (<---B>los personajes son los de siempre de Auster</---B>). Y menos a\u00fan tiene diversi\u00f3n, sobra decirlo. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 me parece tan malo? No s\u00f3lo porque Auster ya haya contado lo mismo otras veces, sino porque los personajes son t\u00f3picos, la trama es de lo m\u00e1s previsible y est\u00e1 mal escrito. No es que parezca que Paul Auster est\u00e9 escribiendo con el piloto autom\u00e1tico, sino que m\u00e1s de una vez me he preguntado de veras si aquel libro no lo ha escrito Auster sino un negro, aunque lo de asumir que un negro sea incapaz de escribir un poquit\u00edn mejor tambi\u00e9n es un prejuicio. El caso es que me cuesta creer que la misma persona que escribi\u00f3 'La Trilog\u00eda de Nueva York' haya creado tambi\u00e9n semejante engendro. Se nota que es un libro escrito de cualquier manera, a pi\u00f1\u00f3n fijo, para las masas, aunque ni yo (esnob reconocida como soy) me puedo creer que las masas sean tan tontas como para que les tengan que escribir un libro de una forma tan simple como est\u00e1 escrito \u00e9ste para que se lo puedan leer. Y es que es uno de los libros con menos misterio que he le\u00eddo nunca, te lo da todo digerido, no es s\u00f3lo que te cuente todas las motivaciones de los personajes de una forma directa y sin tapujos (y por tanto, aburrida), sino que encima te cuenta incluso qu\u00e9 lectura tienes que sacar de la obra. Y encima es \u00f1o\u00f1a \u00f1o\u00f1a, \u00f1o\u00f1a de verdad. Con reencuentros, reconciliaciones, ni\u00f1as adorables y traumatizadas que no hablan, historias de amor cogidas por los pelos, fracasados que por fin encuentran la felicidad, muertes efectistas, malos mal\u00edsimos sin escr\u00fapulos, el once de septiembre, e incluso un rescate heroico... Cursi cursi. Todo especialmente dise\u00f1ado para manipularnos emocionalmente. Pero conmigo no funcion\u00f3, porque juro que a veces se me escapaba la risa con tanto patetismo. \u00c9ste es un libro que hace todo lo contrario de lo que se supone que tienen que hacer los libros: te convierte en un lector totalmente pasivo, no te hace pensar, te lleva de la mano y no te suelta ni un momento como si fueras un ni\u00f1o est\u00fapido que necesita vigilancia constante y una gu\u00eda f\u00e9rrea porque sino te vas a perder. Es paternalista y condescendiente. En resumen es una novela que te atrofia el cerebro Y \u00bfhe dicho que es \u00f1o\u00f1a?

There is no judgement or scorn in his approach to these people, despite their \"follies.\" There isn't much of a \"story\" here. Really, for me, the \"story\" occurs on the last page, when the events of the book are placed in a context larger than the book itself. It makes everything one just read seem less important and more important at the same time. Lately, I have been wondering how I should approach life. I mean should one take life seriously, or should we just coast- do what's good in the moment? And, if I take life seriously, does that cover investing in human beings or does it just mean \"being an adult,\" being responsible, learning to stand alone. I don't know what the answer is, but this book made me think about it more. It would seem that Auster falls on the side of investing in human beings and not taking life too seriously. I feel as if he is asking us to put a strong value on retreat, giving in, the victory in flat-out survival. Every character in the novel is raising some kind of white flag. The characters are dashed; ephemeral hopes dissolved into concrete daily grinds, and the beauty Auster is trying to portray for us is the gentle pleasure of being ok with defeat. It is almost as if he wants us to revel in surrender. He shows us that there are rich intimate spaces and deeper connections, perhaps, in a world that is constructed around commiseration than the one we are used to, the one in which we lie about our aspirations, hide our failures, and strive to make something of ourselves. I wonder how plausible this world is; it does sound and feel very rich and comforting. Everyone fails, and when those around us fail, we somehow tend to love them more. The old adage that flaws and imperfections are what make each person unique and beautiful in his or her own ways, is reflected wonderfully in this book. Somehow, Auster is asking us to skip that whole part in between failure and others loving us, where we feel shame, embarrassment, and pain in the face of our missteps. We have so much to learn from our wrong turns and so much to take in during each fall that we might as well get over ourselves and open up to the world and people around us. There is a place that is referred to often in the book, called the \"hotel existence\" a place where one can escape the bullshit and miserable aspects of the world we live in, a place where one can retreat to a life less entangled in the morass of the planet. The people in the book never get there in a physical sense, but it becomes clear to me that Auster means to say that the \"hotel existence\" is bullshit in and of itself. There is no true escape from the bullshit. Life is fucked. It just is. There isn't escape there is only the white flag. It was an awesome book. ...more This was one lousy book.

One of the reviews here said that the author was writing for his editors- in other words- FOR THE MONEY. There ain't nothing wrong with that. Some of my best friends... It's just that maybe he should've added some life to the mix- something believable. As it was this book was just so bland, and glib and waste of time.

The narrative voice is engaging, though I have to wonder how Nathan went from being a supposedly uninvolved curmudgeon with nothing to live for (unless he's exaggerating) to an active retiree in such a short period of time. Perhaps Auster's point is that moving back to such a place as Brooklyn can do that to one. And, in many ways, this book is a love letter to Brooklyn, where Auster lives. Without giving anything away, I can't say what it is that ratchets up the tension (another Auster trait) from the beginning and leads to a good ending. ...more I know that there have been mixed reviews of this book.

Anyway, I must be part of the provincial masses because I simply didn't understand the backlash. I thought the book was well-written and enjoyable, moving along at a clip. Yes it did get muddy in parts, and yes, there was a bit of melodrama that could've been saved for a Merchant-Ivory film, but overall I thought the book was good. I don't know if I've lost my literary skill or if those who were writing scathing reviews had expected far too much or something different. But the characters were well-drawn. In fact, I wouldn't have minded if the book was longer. There was no lesson, characters were flawed but not charicatures (unless that was the point) and I didn't find myself slogging through endless metaphor. So all in all--I liked it. Revoke my English degree if you must, or stone me for not liking one of Auster's premiere works. But truthfully, if you're looking for a quick, fun read then pick it up and just take the dust jacket off to avoid any stares from the far more literate critcs at the coffee shop. ...more An old dude gives a 9 year old girl her bath.

Set primarily in Brooklyn, the story is narrated by recently retired life insurance salesman, Nathan Glass, who after his divorce settlement has moved to Park Slope believing that he'll spend his last days there,\u00a0having recently suffered from lung cancer. For a while he plays the part of a misanthropist, but then runs into his nephew Tom, once destined for a successful career in academia, but now working in a used book store. The men quickly become reacquainted, appreciating each other's company, and as the novel progresses become involved in trying to solve a family problem as well as partially complicit in a somewhat shady deal... I always enjoy Auster's writing style, and as has been the case in at least one other audiobook of his that I've listened to, this one benefited from his own narration. His narrator is reliable, but at the same time flawed, and at times I cringed at some of his dalliances, but he and Nathan were definitely likeable characters. The multicultural and multifaceted aspects of city life were well portrayed in the novel, and I loved the characterisation of Harry, Nathan's boss, as well as his associates, and their thread of the story. The book isn't particularly long, but there was a lot going on, but in a way that held the reader's attention rather than being too confusing or busy. And who can resist a happy ending?! All in all, a very enjoyable read for me, and one that will encourage me to get back to Auster more regularly in the future! ...more Nathan Glass, a retired life-insurance salesman diagnosed with lung cancer, moves out to Brooklyn to die.

The title stems from a series of notes Glass is putting together on life's mishaps, eventually to be formed into The Book of Human Folly. It's a touching book with the types of well fleshed-out, \"I know that guy\" type of characters. A little more feel-good than I was expecting. Auster in his writing deals with unreliable narrators, which on the positive side leaves opportunities for mystery and interesting reflection. But in The Brooklyn Follies, at times Glass might not have been reliable enough to be believable. For a first person narrator, he gives extremely detailed accounts of other people's lives--stories where, in reality, he would have just had a general synopsis of. The academic dialogue will turn off some readers--the nine-year-old seemed overly precocious (but then again, I don't know many nine-year-olds, so maybe that's unfair)...and nephew Tom, who dropped out of grad school during his thesis, talks like a term paper. My favorite characteristic of the story is a question Auster poses of how people find serenity in their surroundings. Nathan finds harmony in Brooklyn, which is why he chose it as his final destination. Tom has a different notion of serenity, dreaming of developing a small society in the woods, escaping American industrialization. Auster manages to make both scenarios seem desirable. Reflecting back on the book, that was powerful to me since lately I've been trying to decide what my ideal environment is--whether it be city, suburban, or rural life. Sometimes the inconvenience of one makes the other seem more desirable, while sometimes small things, like a scene you witness on the street or your favorite diner, makes you appreciate your current setting. Lately as I've been dealing with the obnoxious cost of living in the NYC area, I wonder why people living in extreme poverty stick around when they could be living in small-town America for a fraction of the cost (yeah, I realize how naive that can sound on paper). What makes a place feel like home? Your family, your job, being able to see a musical once a week? For Glass, a large part of it was the culture of the city. ...more Is Paul Auster worth your time?

Does this return symbolize or mean anything? No. Do we get to feel Brooklyn? No. Serendipity brings him in contact with his nephew; a would-have-been brilliant author / critic, had it not been for... Well we don\u2019t really know. Tom Glass, Nathan Wood\u2019s nephew (and yes, Nathan/Auster does mention this brilliant pun), foregoes his writing ambition for the \u201csafe\u201d job of a cab-driver. Gradually, characters inhabit the story, effacing any potential interest it might spur, besides it being a family-reunion fiction. It feels tedious, and possibly boring, to give an account of what happens along, but I can safely say that, in comparison with third-degree storytellers, no other writer I know of uses this \u201cmagical wand\u201d so frequently, and liberally, to make things happen and work like Auster does: Love develops, people are reunited, oppressed freed, money distributed to those in-need, people cured... So much, that at the end of the story, I am impatiently waiting for: \u201cAnd they lived happily ever after\u201d In all fairness, real life is real life; monotonous, uneventful, duplicate acquaintances tending towards normality... and it is about this ever-flow with its stubborn perturbations, here and there, that Auster writes. But he could have done it with style, with some depth, with something original, something different, than the everyday banter we engage in. Throughout the book, a couple of stories are told about Poe, Melville, and Kafka, though they feel to me as\u201dDid you know?\u201dblurbs. To the post\u2019s question, my answer is No! This will definitely be my last Auster; there are other contemporary writers out there, some certainly in Brooklyn, who better deserve our time and support. ...more I remember not really enjoying City of Glass when I read it in the late 80s. I think I was too young--or too inexperienced--to appreciate Paul Auster back then. I'm giving it another go now, since I have recently been blown away by two back-to-back books of his, The Book of Illusions and now The Brooklyn Follies.

I'm giving it another go now, since I have recently been blown away by two back-to-back books of his, The Book of Illusions and now The Brooklyn Follies. Both books are told in the first person, but their narrators are as different as night and day. The Book of Illusions narrator is a grieving academic while The Brooklyn Follies narrator is a street-smart insurance salesman. One is small-town, the other is big city; one hates his former wife, the other is mourning the loss of her. But despite these contrasts, they are both equally powerful and equally honest characters (honest in that they are true to themselves, not that they are infallible or saintly souls). The Brooklyn Follies was amazing. Like one of the reviews said, it's a soap opera, and it can be deceiving in its simplicity. If you think that what is happening on the page is trivial or obvious, think again. It's all leading up to a very clean and dramatic final paragraph. What happens in the end is not any great, fictitious mystery, but it is a perfectly timed moment within an exquisitely choreographed circus. I've been mulling over this moment for a bit now, and I'm on the fence about what the story as a whole means in light of that final moment. Could it mean that our lives used to be nothing but trivial follies, and that we used to waste our days hemming and hawing over the banal? Or is it a reminder of what life could be despite the tragedies of our modern world? I think I'm leaning more toward the latter, that we should not allow our tendency toward cynicism to take control of our lives, but that we should remember that sometimes, it's the little things that really matter. And that even a hard-nosed cynic like Nathan Glass can be transformed by hope and love. Absolutely fantastic book. I'm hoping City of Glass will take on new meaning for me now that I'm old enough to understand and appreciate Auster. He is a master storyteller. ...more \"Avrei resuscitato quella persona in parole, e una volta che le pagine fossero state stampate e la storia rilegata dentro la copertina, i cari avrebbero avuto qualcosa a cui aggrapparsi per il resto della loro vita.

I personaggi sono simili a noi, nella nostra normalit\u00e0, nella nostra quotidanit\u00e0, ma soprattutto nella nostra fragilit\u00e0 che Auster \u00e8 cos\u00ec bravo a raccontare. Forse le \"follie\" del titolo sono quelle follie umane, vere che ci rendono le persone che siamo nel nostro modo di essere e di vivere. ...more Me ha dejado sin palabras.

His job isn't all aural pyrotechnics, though: he is described as working on minutia, such as \"turning the page of a book, or opening a box of crackers\". Similarly, Paul Auster textures his latest novel with little details that seem insignificant in themselves. When weaved into the narrative, however, they have the power to evoke great poignancy -- perhaps more than the lacklustre plot actually deserves. The narrator is Nathan Glass, a retired insurance salesman who is newly divorced, estranged from his family, and blighted with lung cancer that might or might not kill him soon. At first light, he is a protagonist prepared to go gentle into that good night: \"I was looking for a quiet place to die. Someone recommended Brooklyn, and so the next morning I traveled down there from Westchester to scope out the terrain.\" But this is a Paul Auster novel, meaning that life-changing coincidences are the order of the day. It is thus in Brooklyn that Glass runs into his long-lost nephew, Tom Wood. Tom was once a promising academic, but has since dropped out of graduate school, and now works at a rare-book dealership run by the enigmatic Harry Brightman. Gradually, Nathan finds himself entangled in the shenanigans of friends and family, with a forgery involving Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter thrown in for good measure. Nathan makes an engaging narrator: by turns wry and bitter, but always frank, he describes events in the energetic, kinetic voice that is Auster's strength. Pity, then, that the characters whose tales he must tell are cringingly stock: there's the flamboyant homosexual with a shady past; the confused young woman who dabbles in porn, blues singing and Christian evangelism (not all at the same time); and the precocious child who outwits the grownups, but is really just hurting inside. If the plot unfolds in a rather contrived manner (an unavoidable problem when you traffic in coincidences), the reward for reading is in the embellishments, the plays on words and numbers that are trademarks of Auster. In this novel, names get the grand treatment: besides the polarity of Glass and Wood, we get fantastic monikers like Honey Chowder and Harry Brightman alias Dunkel (which, as Auster takes pains to point out, means dark). Auster sometimes underestimates his reader: at times, characters come right out and explicitly state the significance of various motifs. This heavy-handedness is akin to extravagant sound effects that, rather than enhance the film, serve to jar you out of the reality of the movie. Less obvious, but still palpable, is Auster's affection for his characters. Make no mistake: he does put his characters through a lot of hell -- after all, every novel needs conflict to keep things interesting. But you get the sense that Auster does want them to live happily ever after, or at least live out their disaffection in material comfort. Ultimately, everyone in the novel is looking for refuge, and the story takes us through Utopia's many guises, from the leafy streets of brownstone Brooklyn, to fantastic realms that exist only in characters' imaginations. The seductiveness of escapism is perhaps best expressed in an anecdote Tom tells Nathan about Franz Kafka. According to Tom, in Kafka's last year of life, there was one day when he met a little girl who was distraught because she had just lost her doll. In order to cheer her up, Kafka began writing letters to her in the persona of the doll, distracting her from her loss by presenting her with an attractive alternate reality: \"She has the story, and when a person is lucky enough to live inside a story, to live inside an imaginary world, the pains of this world disappear. For as long as the story goes on, reality no longer exists.\" Even September 11th, which is when the narrative concludes, is unable to completely shatter the optimism Auster injects into the end of the novel. Rather than leave us with the burning World Trade Centre, Auster stops time at eight in the morning, the last hour before the attacks. Nostalgia permeates that suspended moment of innocence -- the ultimate refuge, perhaps, from these tumultuous times. ...more IN PRAISE OF FOLLY The Brooklyn Follies by Paul Auster Do not fool yourselves.

The narrator of the story is Nathan IN PRAISE OF FOLLY The Brooklyn Follies by Paul Auster Do not fool yourselves. Behind a narrative with a literary style \u2013 the narrator\u2019s \u2013 apparently intuitive and simultaneously filled with a straight simplicity and ornaments that seem to evoke a 19th century writing ('there is no escape from the wretchedness that stalks the earth'), a world of allusions and references are hiding, and these make The Brooklyn Follies one of the most inspired works of Paul Auster. The narrator of the story is Nathan Glass, a retired insurance clerk who decides to become a self-taught writer, and you need to be a great author like Auster to take the risk of letting a feeble writer like Nathan control the narrative and still fascinate the reader. Maybe that\u2019s because there are things that can only assume a great expressiveness through the simple words of a simple person \u2013 the honest and yet na\u00efve talent of enchantment and illusion becomes more plausible through the voice of the ignorant than through that of the wise man. Or, in a different perspective, and using a Shakespearean analogy, Iago does not fully pronounce the words of accusation, he knows the effect will be far more devastating if Othello himself verbalises the corollary of suspicion that will destroy him. In spite of all, the usual Auster is there: once more an abrupt beginning \u2013 'I was looking for a quiet place to die'; once more a character-writer; once more a book-within-the-book; once more Brooklyn; once more an immeasurable yet unfulfilled will that some details, waved at us en passant, had been more deeply developed because we are sure that other springs are hidden there \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Auster carries a detail, a character or a situation from a novel to develop it in another one; once more so many traces that make up, on their own right, what can already be entitled an Austerian \u2013 but not austere \u2013 style\u2026 Repetitive? No way. Despite so many references and common traces, The Brooklyn Follies is a completely new work, and not just because of the style imposed by the narrator\u2019s voice which, to the eyes of the Auster reader is like Coca-Cola in the advertising catch-phrase devised by the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, 'primeiro estranha-se, depois entranha-se' (first you drive it out, then it drives into you). The Book of Human Folly, the book within The Brooklyn Follies, the agglomerate of short stories, episodes, loose sentences and descriptions that Nathan Glass writes and reveals throughout the novel is a real prestidigitator\u2019s hat and shows well Auster\u2019 talent to compose anecdotes of human life with a large amount of likelihood (already proven in his National Story Project, which led to the collection True Tales of American Life). These are the anecdotes that make up the traces of the bigger anecdote, for Nathan\u2019s life is also anecdotic \u2013 and like any good comedian of life, he finds himself a suitable sidekick for the comedy, his huge nephew Tom Wood, who had vanished from his life years ago and was reencountered in Brooklyn during the new stage of his/their life/lives. The associations may be countless, from the comedy partnership of Laurel and Hardy to the static tragicomedy union of Vladimir and Estragon, but what is certain is that the relationship between the two characters ends up becoming, to a great extent, the fuel that propels the action. I could still mention, to conclude, the themes focused throughout the \u201cfollies\u201d, the \u201cfollies\u201d of life by themselves \u2013 passion, friendship, ageing, dream, homosexuality, ambition, disillusion\u2026 \u2013 but all those aspects, and many others, only mean a new wrapping for the big streamline, the timelessness that we start to find as a pattern in Auster\u2019s work: the path taken by human life, filled with chance, coincidence, detours, returns, surprises, encounters and evasions and, above all, a lot of folly. ...more Uma das personagens de \"Slaughterhouse-5 - The Children's Crusade\" de Kurt Vonnegut proclama a certa altura que existe um livro que te pode ensinar tudo o que precisas saber sobre a vida, mas que este j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficiente.

Afinal, foi publicado no S\u00e9culo XIX e desde ent\u00e3o o homem deparou-se com novas quest\u00f5es e dilemas morais, usufruindo de um acr\u00e9scimo de liberdade religiosa, politica e social para o fazer (pelo menos numa boa parte do globo). No relativamente curto numero de p\u00e1ginas de \"The Brooklyn Follies\" s\u00e3o abordados quase todos os mesmos temas, e alguns outros, mas sob uma perspectiva mais moderna e menos ambiciosa. N\u00e3o estou de todo a sugerir que \"The Brooklyn Follies\" esteja ao nivel de \"Os Irm\u00e3os Karamazov\" ou de \"Anna Karenina\". A compara\u00e7\u00e3o refere-se apenas ao facto de ser uma obra que abrange muitos temas e quest\u00f5es sobre o g\u00e9nero humano sobre uma perspectiva moderna. Ouvira sempre esta obra ser catalogada, no contexto da obra do seu autor, como um \"Auster-inferior\" por isso abordei-a com algum cepticismo. Fiquei agradavelmente surpreendido. A sua prosa simples \u00e9 viciante, as suas personagens f\u00e1ceis de amar e os temas que aborda s\u00e3o in\u00fameros e abordados de uma forma t\u00e3o directa e simples (mas n\u00e3o simplista) que se torna f\u00e1cil nos identificarmos e relacionar-nos com estes. A sua narrativa n\u00e3o vai al\u00e9m de retratar momentos e conversas na vida de um leque de personagens bastante variado, sui-generis e cred\u00edvel, mas estes momentos e di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o t\u00e3o interessantes e a forma como comunicam t\u00e3o enternecedora que se torna um verdadeiro prazer espreit\u00e1-los. Da obra transpira ainda um despretensioso e genu\u00edno amor pela leitura e inclui ainda uma bel\u00edssima historia sobre Kafka e uma boneca que me humedeceu os olhos. Apesar de ser um livro essencialmente terno e sobre o poder do amor e da toler\u00e2ncia, a crueldade, fanatismo e indiferen\u00e7a do ser humano tamb\u00e9m se encontra devidamente representada em certos momentos que poder\u00e3o ser chocantes para alguns leitores. Mas apesar destes o amor e toler\u00e2ncia prevalece sobre a dor e crueldade existente na vida destas personagens, tal como o leitor deseja que assim seja durante a leitura do livro. ...more Prima opera che leggo di Auster.

Rakastin, en rakastanut, rakastin, h\u00e4mmennyin ja nyt en en\u00e4\u00e4 edes ihan tied\u00e4 mit\u00e4 tunnen. On j\u00e4nn\u00e4 lukea kepe\u00e4n komediallista teksti\u00e4, v\u00e4s\u00e4ht\u00e4\u00e4 siihen ja huomata loppulauseiden j\u00e4lkeen ett\u00e4 lukikin ihan muuta. Hieman pit\u00e4\u00e4 viel\u00e4 j\u00e4sennell\u00e4 omia ajatuksia, mutta ehk\u00e4 se tunne lopulta kuitenkin kallistuu jos nyt ei rakastumiseen niin ainakin vallan vahvaan vieh\u00e4ttymiseen. Austeria t\u00e4ytyy lukea lis\u00e4\u00e4, pian.", "Title": "The Brooklyn Follies"},
